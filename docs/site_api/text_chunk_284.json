You're such an awesome God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many can say amen to [Music] that? Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank the Lord for his mercy to us all. We welcome you here today. We have several visitors that are here. Um came for the school graduation which turned out so beautiful yesterday. Want to say how much we appreciate all of the effort and all the work, the students, the parents, the teachers, the faculty and all that that did it. It's imparted a wonderful thing in the lives of these children. We're grateful we would be able to have it here in the mountains of Tennessee to be able to bring all these Yankees and Southerners and Canadians and all together. As I sat yesterday and I heard the different teachers as they was describing their students and this one got a award for that and another one got an award for that. In my mind, every time I go to a graduation, I think what it'll be one day when we all walk before the Lord. I want to be faithful on that day. Don't you? I'm not interested in rewards and payback or nothing like that. If I can just hear these simple, powerful words, well done. effort, success, this. No. No. Just as long as I know that I've pleased him. Is that what you want from your heart? Amen. It's one of the things that I love about him so much is that we unworthy ones, he changes us and helps us. He gives us the strength to do what he calls us to do. And then just like him, when we get there that day, he gives you a reward for doing what he helped you to do. Truly, totally selfless. That's our God. You sisters, you may think you've done nothing, but you may be one of the very ones that out of your home, God will produce a boy, maybe a preacher's wife, a pastor's wife, or something like that that will affect thousands of people. You remember the prophet telling us about the little lady had a burden on her heart to have a meeting and she goes and rents a place and a preacher comes and preaches. God wanted that woman to have a reward. You're worth something today. It's wonderful to be together, isn't it? Praise the Lord. We have brother Michael Ray here with us today and we're so glad to have him with us. And um he don't want to ride on his father's coel or his grandfather's coel, but he's brother Biscll's grandson and brother Tom Ray's son. Um but he has his own identity. He's brother Michael Raid and we're grateful to have him with us and we just want him to come and uh speak to us today. How many come with needs on your hearts? No doubt our needs would be as diverse as the congregation that's gathered here today. So no matter how spiritual we might think we are and how much great mysteries that we understand, I hope that we never forget how to contact the Lord Jesus. There are many many great theologians in the New Testament, but how many of them could stop Jesus in his tracks? That's the kind of believer I want to be. Can we sing together touching Jesus? and we'll just invite brother Michael to come and let's just open our hearts now. Now, God knows what he's studied and the direction that he's studied. But maybe you have a need today that will lay outside the confines of what he's prepared. But keep in mind, the Lord Jesus loves you so much that he'll cause him to veer off of that, maybe for a sentence, a paragraph because you have a need. You believe that? Let's sing it together. A woman tried so many [Music] physicians yet grew worse. So did Jesus she came. And when that crowd tried to restrain [Music] her, she whispered these words, hallelujah, through her pain. Sing it now with me. Oh, touching Jesus. [Music] [Music] will never be the [Music] same. And there's only one way to touch him. Oh, just believe. Just believe when you call on his name one more time now. Oh, touching Jesus. Oh, is all that really matter and your life will never be the same. And there's only one way to touch him. Just believe. Just believe when you call on his name. Amen. You believe that this morning? Amen. and we just call on his name. He's that close. Too many times I think people think he's far off in some distant place, but he's right here present. Right here present. You just need to call. Amen. Isn't that just just what they did as brother Donnie was mentioning in scripture? You just need to speak out. Maybe maybe blind Barnameus. His faith cried out and he was there. Amen. I greet you this morning. It's uh well I'm just going to take it in for a moment and just uh so honored and privileged to be here with you and I've we've of course known of the congregation here in Tennessee for a long long time but to to be here in this capacity is was never in my wildest imaginations but the Lord has a whole different trajectory for our lives and sometimes it takes you on a maybe a 180 and uh so here we are and we're just thankful to be sojouring with you today. I greet you from brother Tom indeed and the congregation back home and my grandma sister R brother Ed Bisco. They would be I'd be reminis reminiscent to not uh remiss to not regret you from them. And so we just we're fighting the battle up in Canada. I know there's a few here from Canada. Brother Kyle, Sister Christina, I think I seen brother Ben and Sister Well, Amanda, where are you here? Wave your hand at me. I know you're here. There we are. I knew you there. And then some old friends are here. Sister Heidi and I seen brother Nathan. My goodness, we're just so blessed to be part of the family of God and do thank you for opening the the congregation here and all your help yesterday. You just were a real expression of Christ. That's what was just so beautiful just to see the body just joining together from all ends of the earth. That's just a little taste of heaven. Amen. Because that's what the body is from all over the world. And so we just so thank you and butter Donnie so appreciate you. We haven't maybe had a lot of time together but your life has impacted. We were speaking in the office there and I'm just I can say I've been impacted. I know the other side you'll find out the greater but my life hasn't. I just thank you for your testimony for this gospel message that's been around the world. Amen. You have a you have a precious pastor. We do indeed. So this morning we'll just I'm just uh there's been some giants of this message preachers that have preached from this church and uh and I'm not one of those. So just a little simple word this morning, but you pull because it doesn't really matter. Actually, it's all words. So then it's all simple. And so it doesn't really matter how where and in the depths and such. If it comes from from his word, then it it'll feed our souls this morning. Amen. So we'll just turn to the word and not take any more time. We're turn to Genesis 11. You going to pull this morning for me? Yeah. I do. I'll need it. It's going to take me a moment to settle down. All them butterflies. Genesis 11. We'll start at verse one. And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of Shannar, and they dwelt there. And they said to one another, \"Go to and let us make brick.\" And burned them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar. And they said, \"Go to and let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach into the heaven. And let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\" If you go back in scripture and even brother Brandham speaks about it, God had actually desired and he had instructed them actually to multiply and replenish the whole earth. and and their objective now was though to be united here underneath their own desire for a name for themselves. And we'll maybe go into some further scripture, but I'll let you sit and take your seats. But before we do that, let's just have a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we stand here Lord tonight, this morning and conscious Lord that there is each one that are listening this morning standing here. Each one is a soul that you paid a price at Calvary for each one worth Lord is we've been told worth more than a 10,000 worlds. the value that you place in one precious son or daughter here this morning. And Lord, here there's many. And Lord, to stand here, Lord, and to to speak in this capacity, I Lord, I pray there's not a word of my own thought would be expressed, but that the only thoughts would come from the very throne of God this morning, Lord, because that's what will feed a hungry heart, Lord. Maybe somebody here is thirsty and Lord, they need living water like that little woman that sat at the well. Or Lord, maybe somebody is in dire need of some food, some spiritual food in due season. And you alone, oh God, would break the very bread of life to them, Lord. So I pray this morning, Lord, it wouldn't just be a service, but Lord, it' be a time where we can be refreshed and renewed and strengthened and comforted, Lord, brought, Lord, just that little bit closer to your side. and you could Lord come and your presence would draw near and we would leave here Lord never the same again Lord we just don't want to come to a Sunday morning service we want to come to where we can encounter the almighty God and Lord we could our children could know and that you're a living God still the same today Lord not just a God of scripture but if you could raise up out of history as your prophet said and Lord we could just worship together and you'd be pleased Lord to dwell within your praises and within Lord our presence this morning we commit Lord those that would hear and myself that would speak to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats this morning. I feel like I'm a little bit uh I need to grow a few inches cuz uh this is definitely high up on me here, but maybe we'll we'll just uh share a little bit from our heart. The scripture there says, as I was saying there, go to let us build a city. And they said, go let us make a name. This was the Tower of Babel. Of course, we'd have heard this in our Sunday school when we were little children. And their objective was to build something that was great, something that was mighty, some accomplishment that they had done themselves, something that they had they had desired to do. If you look at the scripture, it says, \"Let us make us a name.\" They that's their whole desire was somehow to raise themselves up. But God, he had actually had a desire to scatter the people. He wanted the earth to be filled with life. They said, \"No, no, no. We we want to make us something. We have our own names sake to be made. We we need to put an image out there of who we are and and what we can do and and what we're made of and what we're about and and how big we are lest lest we be scattered. They didn't want to be scattered. They didn't want that really to to replenish and to let that life force go out upon the earth. They said, \"No, we're going to be here and we're going to do something for ourselves.\" And and today I can imagine, you know, how not much has really changed God's seed is is desires to send forth. But unfortunately through the world today too many are concerned and we live in an age that is very self-centered and and all they care about is really let us let me make an image unto myself. Let me create my own Instagram profile or let me create my my new explatform or or this or that or the other. Let me project what I am and what I can do. Now that spirit hasn't changed since Genesis till now. Amen. And so that continues in scripture. He says, \"And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower.\" So God now has stepped down to see what the children of men had built. And the Lord said, \"Behold, the people is one.\" God recognized that they had come together as one. They were united and they have all one language. And this they begin to do. And now nothing, listen to what what God is is saying here. Now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do. Anything that is in their heart, anything that's in their imagination, nothing can be restrained. They've united together and they can do anything they desire. Think about that. This is a an observation as the Lord came down. He said, \"Go to let us go down.\" And there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech. And they at that moment were unified together by their language. This is what gravitated them together. And in a moment that language is is is is what made them one. And in a moment they were no longer one. Amen. Their unity disintegrated. The moment their language was removed. They no longer could communicate to each other. They they couldn't express what was in their imagination. And here now one was speaking this language and another was speaking another. And the unity was broken. And just like that, they were suddenly separated. And what had united them was was not of a of a heavenly nature. I could say it was of a natural ability that they had within their human human uh being and to to project their own aims. And the scripture continues. So the Lord scattered them abroad and from fence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city. Therefore the name is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from then did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of the earth and so here we see the the beginnings of in Genesis as the people now scattered broken and separated and I'll just point and I'll maybe just read the scripture in John 17 and 10 Jesus saying and all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them and now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world. And I come to thee, holy father, keep through keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me. Jesus is praying that they may be one as we are. God had a desire for unity. He had a desire for union that they may be one as we are. And so I want to take up just a little thought this morning and maybe if I could title it unified by our identity or united by our identity and unity is is is something that uh people can come together in a moment to find a common ground. It's it's when people can can find maybe a common cause and it can be as small or as great as as one can imagine. You know some people unite on soggy Rice Krispies. Brother Kyle, as I heard yesterday, you know, you know, you find someone that has a common like as you like and suddenly you're best buddies and uh because you know, you have this interest or a hobby that you find common ground on or or you unite. Many of course countries have united to conquer and and they've come together because they they desire for their for for unification. I would say the world longs for unity. They really do. It's why everyone is so inclusive today. You know, they're trying to come up with some way to bring a unification of the world in some way, but it's a perverted way. But it's something they thirst for. They thirst for unity, something inside of them, cuz at the beginning there was, then they were broken up because they had a perverted desire. But God desires unity. That's his heart. And so, man, it has it built in. And so, there's a incredible power that can come with that as we see in the in the scripture that they had, they were not restrained. And so man seeks it because they know with unity there is indeed power. There's an ability and and if I could just maybe drop in a little uh anecdotal piece of a factual piece of nature for you that could maybe uh bring this out. There's uh there's a Japanese honeybee in Japan and uh there's also a Japanese hornet in Japan. And so these two uh live in the same world in the same area but the hornet is actually the largest in the world. It is two almost has 2 in or so long. It's got a quarter inch stinger and it's got a wingspan of about 3 in. You they're they're big. They're they're monsters and they pack a wallup of wallops of a sting. Not that I've ever had one, but I can imagine. And so these hornets are so large they can actually take on 10,000 count honeybee hive. If there's 10,000 or so bees in a in a hive of a honeybee, they only a dozen or so of these hornets can wipe them all out. quite immediately. They go in there with their with their pinchers and and just tear them apart. And you real you'll notice that an American and and a hybrid and import um honeybees actually cannot stand against these hornets. But the native Japanese honeybee have figured out how to deal with them. And so these hornets will send in a scout and they'll send in it to try and find where the honeybee is. And they'll come into their into their uh into their hive. And the the honeybees will not do nothing until until that hornet touches one of the honeybees. They they kind of let let it be. But the moment it takes and starts to attack one bee, the bee after bee now in the hive start to conglomerate on this hornet and they create what they call a beeball on this hornet and they just continue to grow grow grow and grow until they completely surround in unified force against this hornet as he's tried to come in invade their territory. But they find here's an attacker. And so they come and they they create a a whole ball around him and they surround him and intensify the heat around him and they raise the heat just um not even a degree above what that hornet can handle and they kill him. They have figured out the strength of unity. They figured it out. Nature figured it out. If a bee can figure it out, surely surely man, surely God's people, we can understand God's desiring to unify with his people. Amen. And so all other ground, as we know, the scripture is sinking sand. And and and if if it isn't Christ, if it isn't the word, at some point, whatever you're founded on, whatever you're unified on will crumble. That's just the the bare facts of it. Balum, we see that happen. Kora unified people. They they they they they brought people together, but their unity I could say the unity in itself isn't necessarily the key, but what they were unified on was the problem. So whatever you're unified on is the key to unity. That's really where where it counts. And so some, you know, have unions and are teetering on a fine edge because indeed it's just a whisper away from fracturing their foundations. We've seen conquerors over time try and do that and bring certain things together for their own desires. But human unity is fragile. It's fickle and it's finite. It is. And if you don't know what fickle means, it's an older word. It's changing frequently, especially in regards to one's loyalties, interests, and affections. So, humans unity, if it's on a humanistic aspect, it's sitting there and it's really only based on some interests and affections. And we know that interests change. You grow. And we know interests change as we heard at the grad yesterday. And so humans change and they can get into a problem when they unify on some humanistic aspect. And if we go into scripture just as a a bit of a foundation or or sometimes I find myself going I go down the uh you know kind of go down the negative road to show the positive. And uh so I'll just I'll just going to go down there a little bit. Help me. And then we'll jump back on the other side. Is that okay? The law of contrast is sometimes an easy lesson. Yeah. Jehoshaphat in the scripture, he gets approached by Ahab. And Ahab says, \"Hey, Jehoshaphat, we've got land to take. There's our God-given possession. You know, this is a good, you know, a good idea. We we should go and take our land. Would you come and and join with me, please? You know, your armies and your chariots and and your horses and let us all be one, Jehoshaphat.\" And so Ahab had a desire, but his desire, I don't really think, was to to possess what God had given him. Ahab's desire was not quite founded, I don't think, on really the real foundation. Then Jehoshaphat, you know, he was seeing through he wasn't really seeing through it all completely because he was getting drawn into, well, that sounds like maybe a good idea. I mean, what he's saying is is not too terrible, but you got to be very careful what you listen to and what you get caught up with because it's very subtle how that drawing into, hey, be part of what I what we are and you're like, well, you're trying to discern and got tripped up sounding the the idea sounded pretty good. It it sounded right. Well, yeah, that is our land. You know, we should we should go out there. But if you don't be careful, unity on the wrong basis can get you in deep deep trouble. deep trouble. Jehosh jehoshaphat knew and I I just wonder you know Ahab had been prophesied to die. Elijah had already prophesied that the dogs would lick his blood blood and here Jehoshaphat was in this position and Ahab worked on him. Brother Brandham said he was a borderline believer a lukewarm halfbaked so-called believer. That's that's brother Brandham. He was a pretty good fellow. He repented many times. Brother Brandham said he was caught up in the things of the world but was it was he had enough to believe some scripture. you know, let's claim some land. And so, you know, there was enough. He looked good enough. Or maybe he came to church often or somebody, you know, it's like, yeah, he's a pretty good believer, but he was not all the way. But Abraham said, a pretty good fellow and he was repented times, but he's lukewarm, halfaked, and so-called. So, here was Ahab, and he calls for Jehoshaphat to make an alliance or a union and unite. But Abraham says, Jehoshaphat was invited down to visit Ahab. Ahab showed him all his all the fiery that that that Israel had. And that's when a believer can get into the wrong company. When Jehoshaphat went down to fellowship with Ahab, he got in the wrong pew. He got in the wrong pew. Somehow he got he came to church or something like that. He got in the wrong pew with Ahab. And Ahab started to talk to him, but it wasn't of the right origin. The unity wasn't coming from the right channel. And he started to poke at at Jehoshaphat. I don't know how long he he tried to poke him, but he did for long enough. And Joseph started to lean in. He says, \"Now,\" but the Ram says, \"Now, there's so many times that people can do that with good intentions, people don't mean to do wrong, but they can get caught up with what sounds good. It's a real issue, but they don't see the spirit behind it. And then they don't consult God and what about it and what they and what they should be doing.\" And Abraham says on at one time then when a believer got in the wrong company, he says, \"We have that all the time. A believer by the name of Jehoshaphat got on the wrong company. And when a makebeliever and a believer get together, you got trouble. So we had trouble here. And so Jehoshaphat not realizing it unites with Ahab and he becomes part of Ahab's cause. You don't realize what you actually join yourself to. When you you unite with somebody, you realize you're actually united with everything that they are. You've united with their whole cause. You've identified with everything that they are. Willie, whether you like to or not, you have because you've you've saddled yourself up beside them. And so now his problems is your problems. His worries are your worries. His beliefs almost look like your beliefs. You're like, \"Well, no.\" But no, you've identified with that. You got to be careful. See through it, please, brothers and sisters. We can look at the scripture, but we're living in a day and age where the Satan is so subtle, trying to unite, trying to get you off the word just a little bit. unite with something that's just twisted just a little. It looks pretty good. But it's of death because it's hybrid. And a hybrid religion, a hybrid word is death all the way through. And Jehoshaphat needed to see through it. And here he gets right now mixed up with Ahab. He's assumed now all Ahab's problems. Ahab's enemies were now Jehoshaphat's enemies. Think about it. Jehoshaphat wasn't fighting them people before, but now he's with Ahab. I got to fight with him. Well, you know, let's go. You've saddled up now. Now here we roll. And so Jehoshaphat now is associated. He has to accept the things that he normally maybe wouldn't do. Ahab might come with his whole strategy and say, \"Hey, this is what I think we should do here. We should move our armies this way.\" And Josh's like, \"Yeah, I don't know. That's that's a terrible idea. I I really don't like that. You know, actually, Jehoshaphat, I'm going to disguise myself and you're going to go like looking like kings.\" Uh, that really puts me at a disadvantage, doesn't it? No, I think that's a really good idea, Jehoshaphat. You look all you you dress in your kingly robes. I'm going to disguise myself so they don't know what I look like. Yeah. Well, so then I'm the target. Well, I don't agree with that, Ahab. Tough luck. You You join with me. I call the shots now. Jehoshaphat, wait a second. Isn't this a 50/50? No, no, no, no, no. I'm I'm running this army. I'm running this battle. And suddenly, Jehoshaphat realized he sucked into more than he bargained for. You got to watch what you unify with cuz you might get sucked into more than you bargain for. And so Jehoshaphat now is is gets here. And he comes to pass when the captains of the chariot saw Jehoshaphat that they said surely look at this now. Now if I go back Jehoshaphat did have a little bit there. I don't want to skip too far but I'm I'm racing against the clock. Of course he called for Micaiah. We know that he called for the prophet and they he said you know they everybody was saying you can go. It's good to go. And Jos said, \"I I'd like to hear from a a prophet, please.\" And so he he his heart was stirring. Something's a little off here. Something's a little wrong. I need to We need to go back to the word. I just don't I just don't quite see this lining up. I need to go back to the true word. I need to get into the message myself. I need to hear from the word of the hour. Give me a prophet that's true. I don't like him. I don't like what he says. He kind of preaches against me, but it's true word. I know it's too tough. I got to hear it. Sometimes it tells me I can't do this. I shouldn't do that. Ah, grace against me. Come on, Ahab. I want to hear the truth. Something in Jehoshaphat rang out cuz a seed inside was just grading against it. It got sucked in, but he was grading. Amen. So they go forth into battle and surely it came to pass when the captains of the chariot saw the Jehoshaphat that they said surely it is the king of Israel. Yeah I can bet you Jehoshaphat said see I told you Ahab. Thanks a lot. It's like well you unified. And so he's there in his chariot and he says and and they turned aside to fight against him. So now it's like Jehoshaphat suddenly the target and the scripture says he cried out. Jehoshaphat came to a point where he was not willing to take the hit for Ahab any longer. He came to the point where he's like, \"Forget it. I'm not willing to go down this road any longer. I It's not true. It's I'm not falling. It's it's off a little bit and I'm willing to I need to cry out, oh God, take me. Save me from this.\" Nothing mattered anymore because now it was Jehoshaphat's life on the line. You come to a point where you realize my family's gone this way. My life has gone this way. I've gone off the edge to be an edge. I' I've unified with things of the world and I'm done with it. Oh God, I'm crying out this morning because I need to come back to the word. You should have never been there in the first place. Amen. And I wonder how many believers are getting in trouble in times and they may even be in a battle and it looks like everything is against them and they get because they get caught in the wrong union as Jehoshaphat did and they don't realize that the battleground around them is actually really the cause of a wrong alliance and mistakes they've made, trials they've had actually the trials that Jehoshaphat was going through is because it was his choice. He made a wrong choice. We've all made wrong choices. I've made wrong choices. But you know what the difference is? Jehoshaphat was willing to do something. Jehoshaphat cried out. Jehoshaphat did something. He didn't hunker down in his idea. Well, this just is what it is. and and and and and that's too much pride. You mean I got to humble myself and I got to make this right here. I got to do that or I got to walk back and I got to go talk to the pastor and and tell him, you know, I was wrong here. I shouldn't have never done that. You know, no. Jehoshaphat humbled himself. Yeah. He was a king, but he humbled himself. And the scripture says he cried out. But if you go into second Coronicles, it goes even a little further than just that. cuz if you leave it there, it cried out. He's like, \"Well, what what happened?\" But 2 Chronicles 18:31 says, \"And it came to pass when the captain saw Jehoshaphat, and they turned there, and the compass about him to fight, but Jehoshaphat cried out.\" And it continues on, and it says, \"And the Lord helped him, and God moved them to depart from him.\" If you cry out, don't hunker down just because you've got maybe stuck in some sort of unification with something that you know is wrong. cry out. And the Lord helped him. The Lord stepped on the scene. The Lord says, \"I see you. I know you maybe made a bad choice. That's okay. I'm still here. You're still mine. You're still my seed. Just cry out. Don't get all condemned and oh, down and the devil pound on you. Yeah. No one's going to accept you anymore. No one's going to even want to talk to you anymore. You should be ashamed of yourself. You just go in your little hole and hunker down until the end of time.\" No. cry out and say, \"Oh God, restore unto me the joy of my salvation.\" And your scripture says, \"And the Lord helped him. And if he helped Jehoshaphat, if he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, I can tell you if you cry like Barnameus, if you cry like the woman in the in the well, or anybody in scripture, he will help you.\" Sometimes we just don't cry. Don't get sucked in to some alliance with some union with something of the enemy and stay there. Not a moment longer. Jehoshaphat's there for you. Cuz a trail of of a wrong union. When you unite, you create a covenant. A union is a covenant. You know, when someone makes a covenant, it does more than just bring people together. They when you enter into an alliance or a covenant or a union, it's it's something more. You're joining at a layer much deeper than hey, hey buddy, how's it going? Yeah. Hey, great. Great. Having a good day. See you later. That that's that's not a union. When you unite, it's you're becoming one. Scripture in Exodus 34 says, \"Observe that thou which I commanded thee in this day. Behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Hitittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.\" This is God speaking, \"Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, whether thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee.\" God is warning, don't unite. Don't make an agreement. Don't make an alliance with the inhabitants of the land. He says, \"But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, cut down their groves, for thou shalt worship no other god, for the Lord whose name is jealous.\" That's a strong scripture. Why is his name jealous? He said, \"Really?\" Because we we often have a a negative connotation to jealous ether jealousy or or someone has a that's a it's a negative word in our mind jealousy. But God has actually said his name is jealous because God when he would when he identifies in scripture and if we go to verse 15 he says lest they'll make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go a whoring after their gods. God always, if you see often in scripture, when they start to go and unite with idol worship, he relates it to whoring. He relates it to a union, a false perverted union with a perverted life that comes out of it. And so God's saying, \"I'm jealous over you. I desire unity with you.\" It's a jealousy of a husband for a wife that someone is trying to make approaches and he's jealous over you and he says don't you dare go a whoring after another god. Don't you dare unite with something that's perverted because out of that union produces perverted life. [Applause] You and I have been trained to believe that God's heart is a heart of love because we have a fuzzy self-centered possessive desire. this kind of definition of love. We we tend to imagine that God's just always forgiving, which he is, but generous and kind and overlooks his children's mistakes and rebellions and holds his breath until eventually stop acting like we are and return to his care. But we don't realize that God's a jealous God. Do not care. He God cares for you. He desires your unity. He desires your relationship and he's fervent for it. And so he's passionate in scripture. He says, \"Don't go a whoring. Don't make a relationship with another idol. And that's in that's in Israel. But what about today? What about today? God's just as passionate about our spiritual walk. Just as passionate about our natural desires. If we place anything above him, it's an idol. It could be an interest. It could be a desire. It could be a sports. I don't really care what it is. But if it's above him, you are going a whoring after it. And he's saying, \"I'm jealous over you. I desire a union with you. Kill it. Knock it down. Kill the idol. Break the statue. I just want you [Applause] cuz idolatry was always connected with a wrong union. It relates to a marriage union. The worship of another God was viewed as entering in to a perverted relationship. And God hated it. He hated it. And he's jealous. My name is jealous. Because a union is actually the passing of life. It's the transition or the transferring of life from a man to a woman. And idolatry as a union was passing perverted seed which brought forth perverted life. And Israel was forgetting that they have been called, as we go through the different scriptures, Israel been called to be a separate people, a peculiar nation, not to be united with any other. We know this. Anything before God was an idol. You know, it always starts small though. It's not really a big deal. It's a little harmless, especially in this age. We have to tolerate so much or they try to tell us we have to tolerate so much. We don't have to tolerate nothing. You don't have to you don't have to succumb to anything. Hollywood pushes its way in your face. Politics push it way in your face. Music, fashion, I don't really care what it is. Your culture, social culture, I don't really care what it is. It pushes change in your face. You have to accept it. You have to believe it. You just have to tolerate this. I don't tolerate nothing that is beyond this right here. If it isn't on the word, if it doesn't align with that, I will not unite with your idea because I will not accept your battle. I will not accept your redeem all the the the consequences of it. I unite with the word and the word alone. That's more prevalent in this age than any age. Never. Never just take a step as Jehoshaphat did. Well, it's all right. Maybe I should. You shouldn't. Stay right here. Stay right here. Amen. Often people leave this message and often they become more spiritual. And it has this perception, why we've never had it better. You just give it time. You just give it time. And you find out because it takes time for a little seed to grow. and you just don't move and you just watch the life and you watch the life and then you just wait and you watch that life. It'll either be true if it's on there. If it's not, it'll be deformed and perverted and in time anyone that I know don't get sucked into the very tendencies of the beginnings. Oh, it looks pretty good. It isn't good. You just watch it. Amen. Amen. Israel got confused on their identity of really who they were. They had gotten Balam had tried to suck them in and they'd created some unions and such and you know I can imagine you know Balam and the Amorites and the Moabites you know the Moabites trying to tell them that they were the same. And if you take a step back and realize that the Moabites in Israel had nothing in common in their identity of who they were and Israel should have taken a step back and and said wait a second where do I come from? Where is my identity? Because Moab would have had to go back and put their identity in a in a perverted relationship with Lot. Israel would go back to their identity and say, \"Wait a second. I come from the lineage of Abraham. I come the lineage of father Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. That's where I come from. And you're telling me I'm the same as you and you come out of Lock B. That's not what I'm identified with.\" They should have taken that step back and realized there was nothing the same with their identity and where they came from. That's good. My identity is in the covenant that Jehovah made with my father Abraham. We're a chosen people. We're a holy nation. We're peculiar people. That's what they should have been saying. No, we're the same. We worships very similar. No, you don't. I worship the true and living God. And I just can tell you just by looking at everything around, we're not the same. But it just takes even just one. And I haven't I'm sure I really want to long I'm going to book an appointment with Caleb in scripture. And so I have many million years reserved with him. So you'll have to take a second seat after me cuz he's one of my favorite of scripture. And he's he knew his lineage. You know, he I I I note in scripture, note his verbiage. Note his words. He spoke in Numbers 13 and 30. And Caleb stealed the people before Moses. You know the scripture. And he said, \"Let us go up at once and possess it.\" He said a certain word in scripture. It's let's possess it. Because if we can go back, he can track his identity back to his father Abraham who said in Genesis when the angel of the Lord came to Abraham the second time and he said, \"By myself have I sworn, sayeth the Lord, because thou hast done this thing and has not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee. Multiplying I'll multiply. Thy seed is the stars of heaven and the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy.\" That's what Caleb was reaching back and saying, \"That's what I'm uniting with. That's where I come from. We can possess it because the promise is there.\" Moab couldn't go back to that. Yes, sir. Good. I wonder about the spiritual seed of Abraham, the royal seed. Can we get caught like maybe and cry out maybe like Jehoshaphat? We sometimes we can get confused on our identity and oh maybe slip into that but because we didn't come from a harlot mother. We didn't come from some denominational system that says well we just kind of look the same. We can worship the same. No we cannot. We have a word of the hour. I can go back to where the source came from. That my identity is straight from the word of the lord. Not from some system not from some unification that we see going on today. We're not unified with that. We are unified with the word of this hour. My eternity doesn't my my identity doesn't go back to some nice council 325. I ain't going to some celebration 1700. That's not where I came from. I came from eternity and I go back to eternity. I don't have an origination here on this earth. I come from the eternal seed of God. Oh glory. Thank you. It's important to recognize your nationality. I realize I'm speaking in America. I do realize that, which should be a plus because then you really, really get it. But, you know, that's why the Olympics is a big deal because everybody rallies around their nationality. Yeah. You could be living in America, but your roots go from Sweden. Well, I wonder who are you cheering for suddenly. Well, you know, it's Swedes that I'm cheering for. Or maybe it's Norway or maybe it's China or wherever it is. But somehow something greater than maybe just your habitation takes effect. Maybe where I'm planted don't matter no longer, but where I came from suddenly has a very powerful pull. And so they cheer. They Yeah. Go Norway. Well, you're red, white, and blue. Well, yeah, I know, but actually I come from Norway. Who knew? Every four years you find out. And suddenly it conjures up a level of unity you never see in other aspects. Way beyond the Rice Krispies, but a cow. It goes somewhere deeper. Brother Brandham says, \"Let me take it a little further. The scriptures is what tells you what you are.\" And I wonder what could really happen or I should say what is happening when the church of the living God starts to recognize my nationality. [Music] Hey, where you really came from. It isn't a red, white, and blue banner. It isn't a red maple leaf. It isn't nothing to do with that. I come from another country. And when we can come to that recognition, the unity is at another level. I said, let's identify who we are a little bit. Can we do that this morning? Let's let's go back and find my type, your type, because it's always good to to rehearse where you came from. Amen. I They can reminisce. You know, when people get together, have been apart for a long time that are come from the same place, they start talking about different things. Hey, do you remember this? Yeah. If I was going on the Norway thing, hey, the Lepsa, you like the Lepsa? I love Lepsa. I mean, yeah, I know the best Lepsa comes from here. I don't even know there's any Norwegians in here. But you start to talk about your origin. You start to to discuss all the all the different things you love there. Maybe some you haven't had a certain piece of food for so long, you're like, \"Oh, I just wish I could have certain such such food.\" Yeah, I know. We don't get good stuff here. So you talk on that level. So let's talk about our origin. You can find a match in scripture where you are and who you are, who you can line up with because scripture is where you come from. And so if you can find yourself here, you can actually then you know where you do come from because this is telling you as brother says scripture is what tells you what you are. And so you can say, well, many can go in there and I can see ones that have have perseverance or those that have courage or those that have patience or steadfastness or Job and different ones longsuffering through through hard pains and such. But I want to go even deeper than that because there's a strain that goes deeper than just identifying with someone that was perseverant or David with with great courage because there's a strain that goes somewhere deep past the surface level of our beings. And it's when the word was made manifest in their hour, something triggered. It's called faith. Amen. Amen. They believed. When God came by Abraham's way, he believed. Yes, he did. When the widow of Zarapath stepped out on Elijah said, \"Bake me a cake.\" And she's all she had was just nothing left but for herself and she's going to die. And he says, \"Bake me otherwise.\" And then, you know, we'll go from there. Kind of thing. and she just trusted in the word that was speaking to her in that moment. That's a strain that runs through all of God's people. It can point you back to your origin when the word comes by your way. Like a Peter when he said you're from your name is is Jonas and and he points to Nathaniel and said I seen you under the tree or the woman at the well. All of them had the same strain. They believed the word as he stepped by their way. Then in this day, if the word of this hour would start by your seed and shines a light on your life, what is you're going to what's your heart going to do? It responds and it tells you where you came from. [Music] Shunomite woman, Jeremiah, Paul, Polycarp, Luther, all had a word come in their hour. And in this hour, heaven's homeland security is coming by and is doing doing identity checks. He's looking for a passport. You know what they're looking for? The word's looking for a faith response to the word of this hour. When this message came by your way, you say, \"Can't sell believe?\" And the word presents a check. Uh, can I see your identity? You know what it looks for? It's like, I see faith. I see faith. I see response to the word. I made an understanding, brother Michael, but I believe it. That's all heaven's looking for. It's like, yep, there it is. There's another one face seat of Abraham. There's another one face seat of Abraham. There's another one like the one at the whale. They got the same identity on the check with the word of this hour. I can say they're homebound. Amen. Fathan and Kora in the scripture, they went along for so long. But when it started getting a little tighter, that's when you realize then you can see, hey, where's the identity? Where's your identity? It's going to come. It's coming. It's here. It's getting squeezing. The pressure is becoming so tight, this going that way, someone going this way, and you finding out, wait a second, and I'm walking alone. That's okay. God's people have always walked alone. Micaiah walked before Jehoshaphat alone. Elijah walked alone. Many in scripture walked alone. That's your identity. Standing on the word. If it's alone, so be it. So be it. The 70 he left went to weed them out when the word got real tight. Oh my. But through all them dark ages, God was waiting for a time. He'd prepared a word for a special hour to ignite. He knew it'd be a dark age in Leosia. He knew it'd be oh gross darkness fill the earth. He knew young people that it would be difficult. He knew what you'd be going through. He knew you'd be hammered and hammered through ad and this ad and through every app and social media platform and everything. All the pull and the draw and the desire and the tanalization of entertainment. He knows and he knew. So he prepared a word for this hour to ignite a recognition of where you came from. That's why we cherish this message because it's bringing to you the reality that we're heavenbound. a reality of your identity that you came from God and you're going back to God. That's why Brother Brandham could speak on the ego scream because that's exactly what was happening. The message would scream out and bring you back to that pro little ego as you know the story probably 1,800 times. But I'll tell it to you again because there he was pecking his life out in misery on the worms of this world and he's wondering man living surely he would look down and then look up and look down and look up and man we're just not the same. No, some of you that maybe were sitting in some denominational system and you would go to church maybe day in and day out or week in and week out and you'd be like, \"Man, it just ain't hidden.\" You know, but what else is there? This is the best I can see that old chicken eating the worms. Really? Is this all there is? My soul crith for more. My deep calleth for more. But this is all I see around me. That's why God prepared this message to help you to look up a little bit, hear something a little different that starts to trigger something. You realize, you know, that first time in that story when that little eagle would have seen mama eagle. Wow, look at that creature. That is the most stunning, amazing thing I ever saw. Amen. Wait a second. There's something similar to what I see. There's something similar to what I hear that's calling something here. That must be where I belong. Hallelujah. Amen. Then you look at the chick and you say, \"Exactly right. I knew I wasn't like you. That's what I'm like. Oh no, that's the enemy. Run for the hills.\" We'll leave it there. Why? Because God was desiring to unite you with him. Cuz God is desiring union. It's not dos and don'ts, young people. It's far beyond dos and don'ts. Cuz when you recognize his love is calling you. It's a love relationship. You say, \"Lord, you've called. You saved me.\" And you start to go through scripture what he did for you. I say, \"Lord, the dos and don'ts fade away.\" And all these things and all your eyes stay on him. The son of man, Christ Jesus, united heavens and earth. God reconciling man when he came to break the curse that divided and broke fellowship and broke union and he comes down to mend that a complete union. Now God dwelling in flesh. Brother Brandham says when God and Christ became one when the dove came down on the lamb heaven and earth kissed each other and God and man was reconciled together. He says, \"Why?\" It was one of the greatest moments the world has ever had. God desiring to unify once again with his creation. But this was not the end. The end all, I should say, as God had he he's going to bring now peace and men the chasm. The image that he had made now was redeemed. But God had a greater desire than to leave it just there. This hour he was going to reveal himself again as a son of man for the whole purpose so that you could come to yourself and recognize your identity and realize I don't just want to come and mend the chasm but I need to I need to abide within you. Yes. wasn't just to come and and redeem man that way, but God wanted to come now and abide within and unify him with you and that aspect of coming to yourself and when you realize where your identity is and God can reveal that to you in such a revelation and and that union then therefore cannot it can't be broken. Revelation can't be broken. When God reveals that to you, it's you and your alone. Devil can't put his little fingerprints or his toe printints on that area that God alone has. So when he reveals where you came from, now that is tied for all eternity because there's nothing that can break it. It's like the prodical son when he was there there in the in the pig in the mud mud pit of of sin and despair and there he was wondering and and in the muck of shame and condemnation. But something changed. An angel came by his way and he came to himself. That wasn't something he conjured up. It wasn't something that he, oh, I must, I must, I must believe, I must believe. No, nothing of that nature. It was God that descended and said, listen, boy, get up and go back. God brought him back to himself. A revelation came upon him of what? Who he was. He sat there and said, \"Wait a second. What am I doing here? I am actually the son of my father. Why am I in the pig pen? That was a revelation God gave of his identity. His identity never was broken ever. He just came to recognize it was there. Your identity has never come out of nowhere. It was always there. God always knew you. He had you in the foundation of his mind before the foundation and you just came to the recognition. Yes, sir. That's what this message is. Has the power to bring recognition back to your soul of where you originally came from. Hallelujah. It didn't matter what the prodical son did. It didn't matter his all his mistakes, how vile and how wretched, how terrible and how down. It didn't change his identity. That's true. I don't care how heavy the condemnation that the devil puts upon you. It don't change your identity. Amen. Amen. All you got to come to is allowing God to straighten your soul with revelation and it's over. It's over. Amen. That's that is a unity. Believing on his word will bring life. We can see it all through scripture. Abraham believed God's word brought forth in Isaac. Hannah believed the priest's word and she brought forth a Samuel. Shunimite woman believed the word of a prophet brought life to her son twice. Actually, Elizabeth brought forth a son. Mary by faith in the word of God brought forth the word of God. And so when you unite with the word, the inevitable production is life. But Abraham says, \"There you are. That's oneness with God.\" When that power works in me, works in you, we are one. He said one is with God is to have God's spirit in you agreeing with the word all the word the whole word and make it manifested in power. I thought Lord if we could just come to a place where we can recognize really what lies within you like well brother Michael I'm just a believer here in Tennessee. No, no, you're not just a believer in Tennessee. You are actually omnipotent. You say, \"Well, that's a tough one to swallow.\" Well, wait a second. Wait a second. Does eternity lie within you? It does, doesn't it? Because you're a seed of God. If you're a seed of God, you come from the eternal thoughts of God. And God does not have any time bound elements to him. So, he's eternal. So, therefore, who's eternal with him? Amen. So then if he's omnipotent, who is also filled with omnipotence? It would be his people. And so therefore, if you realize that you are walking with that seed inside of you, therefore the scripture then says, if two or three whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again, I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done of them of my father which is in heaven. Why? Because two omnipotants actually are coming together agreeing on the word of God. Your origin, your identity is there and you realize, wait a second, we have the power within us because the life of God is flowing through me and through you. So we agree on any one thing. Who is now coming behind that? [Music] You're calling on the power of all heaven. I have in my notes somewhere. I I can't even imagine Satan when he tried to tempt the King of Kings. You know that Satan actually Satan knew God on so many different levels. He was a Lucifer, angel of light. This He was powerful. He'd seen God in action. He'd seen God do so many things in heaven that I would even know how to describe. Lucifer had a second seat to it all. He had a front ring seat of all of God's power that uttered through the eternities as he as he worked his wonders. And then he saw God in his fury as Satan pulls away, takes the angels out, and they the war. And Satan knows the fury of God. Satan's seen God at work more than you and I have seen than ever. He knows who the King of Kings is. He does. Oh, yeah. and he comes down and he sees this little humble man and he's wondering who is this? But Abraham says he didn't believe that he was Emanuel and he's like who is this? Satan has seen God. He'd seen him in fury. He'd seen him in glory. He'd seen him shining. He'd seen him manifest attributes you and I haven't. And he's wondering who is this? And it was God. And he's confused. Well, dude, turn these stones into bread. And he's trying to he's trying to find out. Are you really the creator? Are you really the one that can preserve yourself? I've seen God show his force. I've seen God show his fury, but this isn't matching. Turn the stones into bread. It is written, \"Man shall not live by bread alone.\" That's an odd response. Well, I know that's in the scripture. And so, he throws it again. And he throws it again. And God spokes back the word to him. Speaks the word back to him. Devil's just scratching his head. Who on earth is this? I just don't believe it's Emanuel. There's no way this can be God. He's too humble. He's too simple. He's too He He I just can't even see it. He's from an illitant bird. There's no way this is the son of God. No way God would go into humble flesh like this. There's no way omnipotence reigns in that fleshly body. Amen. And the only time he got an answer to his question is when he stepped into hell. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. That's when he found out who he really was. He says, \"You've wondered, devil. You've wondered and you've wondered and you wondered. Wonder no longer. I'm going to take them keys from you. I've conquered everything you've tried to give and I'm stripping you of death and hell in a grave and I've come to show you my true identity. Hallelujah. He's doing that to you. Every day he pounds you, he's wondering, \"Are you really a son and daughter of God? Can you really be that? There's no way. She's too humble. She's too simple. There's no way. She's got mistakes. I mean, I pound her and I pound her and I pound him with her faults and his faults and he was tripped up here. How on earth could omnipotent be inside that body? [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's okay, devil. We've got a time coming when you're going to wonder no longer. When we sit beside the king in his throne and we stand there before the world and you can wonder all you want, but at that moment, you're going to start gaping. They were all this time I wasted my energy for nothing. Yep, you did. Yes, sir. Because we're more than conquerors cuz I got his life in me. I'm identified with him and he's identified with me. I can't wait for that moment. Because he still has that little question. He saw the miracles. Devil saw all the signs. He saw all the wonders and still wondered until we'll say it all together when we get there. Devil wonder no longer. Amen. Said, \"Brother Michael, I have so many mistakes.\" Well, we took care of that, but I'll just take care of it a second time just in case you missed the first time. God didn't unite with your flesh. No, he united with your soul, your faith. That's what connects you. But Abraham says, and just to give you the quote from questions and answers so you can take it home with you and put that in your pocket and for the next time the devil comes to your door outside in the parking lot. He says, \"How can I take a cocker and make it a grain of wheat out of it?\" He said, \"It's impossible.\" And you know the quote, he said, \"Inside the cockar has been transmitted from a cockab to wheat, cockar germ called wheat life.\" And brother goes through the quote. But the nature, he says, of the cockab is still sticky. See, it will be it will be until this new life has been fully developed out of the ground and raised up again. So, we're dealing with this flesh until that time. He says, \"And the cockabore is still sticky, but it's got a nature on the inside of it of wheat.\" So, you will make mistakes. We will stumble, but you'll get up because something inside of you drives you to get up. You can't quit whether you like it or not. You feel like someone throwing someone in the towel. Sometimes your family is moving this way and that way and you feel alone. But something inside, what is it? It's your identity. It's where you came from. Man, that's why the devil pounds you to try and make you forget. He tries and makes you forget. You know, it's not a wonder that Alzheimer's or dementia is so prevalent in this day. Natural type spiritual spiritually. There's a lot of spiritual Alzheimer's out there. Satan's so wre havoc. People have got confused and wandered on this idea of what the gospel message is. And the church has become so watered down and so weak need and not following the true word. They're trying to maybe look maybe trying to get people to to like what they're doing and they become more like rock bands than than a church service. That's a hey I nothing compares to worship by the true believers like this morning when you can just come with pure worship. Oh but there's churches are trying to fabricate something. It's that they got spiritual but ram called spiritual amnesia. He says how can you be a Christian and deny the word? You can't do it. He says, \"If I'm living in this generation, what this portion of word has promised for this generation, I've got to be that. If I'm going to be a Christian, I got to be identified with all that the Bible preaches and stands for everything. Every bit of it. I can't pick and choose. If I'm identified with it, I'm identified with all of it.\" Amen. The problem is people don't know what they're identified with. And if I could say this morning, some of you, well, help me. uh you know we maybe we'll be the 51st state sometime so I can kind of walk here prematurely. Okay. But if we I I have to say the US has forgotten a lot of what it stood for. What it founded on and what it fought for. It's it's forgotten that if they if they've got an amnesia or an Alzheimer's disease of what has what those original articles were founded on. If you go back to that life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, freedom of religion and one nation under God, they've left God. They now are even fighting for the They're not even fighting the same nation anymore. It's broken. Unity, the union. Amen. The definition of what even the forefathers fought for, of what America even defines, are very two different things. That's right. what people are fighting for now and really what the American Constitution as such even came up to uphold and to identify what you fought for your rights and rights and freedoms is so different. You know, I wonder if the men that fought for these way back would stand today. Yes, sir. They said that's what we fought for. What a terrible terrible moment. His wounded leg, blood running down. He's got a bullet wound here in his arm. He's leaning on his musket. And he could be brought to time and said, \"This is the state of the union.\" And he'd hang his head and he'd weep. I didn't fight for that. That's not what I stood for. That's not what my forefathers stood for. That's not what was written on the page. That's not what was written there. I didn't fight for that. Steven and Paul and Peter, they brought forth in time and they see the denominational system and Rome raising its head. They said, \"No, that's not what we fought for. We didn't stand for that.\" And not so long ago, then people went through and they started slashing everything down. We no longer want to be identified for that part of history. But that that's that's just part I mean there brother says is the good and the bad. There's all parts you identified with it all. You're destroying my identification. I don't want it no more. Brother says I must never forget this. I want to remain a true American citizen. I must remember that I'm I'm what my nation is for I'm identified by my nation. Catch the spiritual parallel please. to forget her, to fight for her, or to die for her, or to stand for all she stands for. I must stand for it. What my nation is, I am. What it stands for, I stand for it. Amen. You cannot forget what your nation stands for because then how do you fight for it? If you don't know what you're fighting for, you're like, well, I don't know. How do you have ferocity in the battle if you don't even know what you believe in? Well, you know, I think we I think we stand for for truth. Uh, what is serpent seed exactly? Haven't really been in the message lately. What do we What do we believe? Oh, yes. We believe in one God. No, no, you need to know what you're fighting for. Amen. They knew what they fighting for. I wonder if they someone read them the declaration or all of their desires. Here's what we're fighting for. We're not getting taxed. We're not having this. We're not being on the oppression. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm here for. Sign me up. Let me just read for you what we're fighting for. And we can go through scripture after scripture after scripture. And you're like, \"Yes, I believe that. I believe that. I believe that. That's exactly what I'm fighting. Sign me up.\" Amen. But says, \"You're no more an American citizen when you can't become part of it. And you're no more a Christian when you can't become part of him.\" Amen. Amen. And down through the ages, Satan's been trying to cancel or distort or create a a different remembrance of who God is. Trying to remove the statutes of what we stood for. I'd say if I could say, well, what are the articles that Christ stood for? Where are they? What is it that he hung on a cross for? That would take a very long long if I took the scroll of the of our declaration. Amen. of independence. That's right. This is my Declaration of Independence. I've seen yours. I've walked in there. I've looked at the original signatures and it's an amazing thing. I'm not even American, but I stand I almost salute. My goodness. I feel it. You walk in that rotunda and we Wow. I went in Canadian. I walk out like, \"Oh, I feel like an American.\" It's amazing with the natural nationality, the power of it. Brothers and sisters, thank you, Lord. What about when we start to look at the word of God, not signed by John Hancock, his big fancy Jay, whatever is their age, signed in blood from Calvary's cross. And we can walk up to the word and we can start to read it. say, \"Oh, God, I want to read my declaration. I want to read my freedom. I want to read what I'm fighting for. I want to read what I'm identified with because I'm a soldier of the cross of Calvary. This message, this word, lest we never forget.\" What do we stand for? If I could hold the volumes of this message here and stack them up high, God, we stand for this word. One word, one baptism, one faith, a united bride. Everything, our conduct, our respects, our home, our dress, our appearance, it's all there. It's all in our declaration. You know, it says in there, there's a word. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. My somebody was inspired. You know that word unalienable is quite a word. It means impossible to take away or give up. That's in your earthly declaration. Unalable. Unable to be taken away from or given away by the possessor. Freedom of religion. The most inalienable of human rights. Oh my goodness. That's your natural. Amen. What about this? Unal inalienable. Unable to be taken away. Once it was signed and sealed on Calvary, there's no way your rights and freedoms can be taken away. I started to look through. I said, \"Well, do we even have an idea of what those even are? What my what my where my identity is? I that's what the whole loosing of the seals has been is to identify who you [Applause] are. That's why then when you become identified with all of this, every aspect of it, then you can realize when brother Brandham says I'm identified. I was there with Abraham when he put the sacrifice of Isaac on the altar. I was there. Why? Because he's identified with everything Abraham is and identified with. I'm identified with Joseph. I'm identified with Jacob. I'm identified. I was with Moses. I was with David. I was with the Hebrew children. I was with Daniel. I was at Pentecost where the Holy Ghost came down. Why? Because I'm part of him. I was there with him at the cross. I'm identified with his sacrifice. You're part of him. You're united. Amen. Thank you, Lord. But the Rabb says, \"Don't get spiritual amnesia cuz you'll identify yourself with something else.\" He said, \"Stay right with that word.\" There are so many freedoms in the scripture. I don't even have time because of my time is up. Freedoms from guilt and sin and shame. And if you need to go through your declaration, just go to Romans 8:1. That's right. There is therefore now no condemnation. You haven't gone through your declaration. You maybe need to. You need to walk through there and say, \"Well, I'm have a need in my body.\" You need to go through your declaration of independence. And that's where you'd say, \"He shall lay hands on the sick, they shall recover. He's the healer of all my diseases. By his stripes, I'm healed. Yes. It's in your declaration of independence. You say, \"Well, brother Michael, I'm in desperate need. I need his help. I need the Lord.\" Well, just go to article number Psalms 12:21, sorry, 2:8. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. Amen. He will not suffer by thy foot to be moved. He that keepeth thee will not suffer. Behold, slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy keeper. The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil. He shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, even for ever more. My help cometh from him. My help cometh from the Lord, the writer and the center of my declaration. Hallelujah. As we come to a close, at least I try to. Now I'm going to descend. You know, when a husband and wife unite, there's something that happens. Everything that the husband has becomes hers. This is what union does, you know, in engagement and when they're seeing each other before and they're getting to know each other, she has no claim on nothing. Nothing. And he actually don't have much. He doesn't got no responsibility. You know those awkward times when the first time he he pays for her lunch, it's like, well, I kind of want to pay for her, but it's kind of weird, maybe. It's a friend. She's like, \"I've been paying for my own.\" It's It's that I'm just going from experience. It's kind of that awkward moment that first time you're like, \"No, I got it. You know, you want to be the man.\" \"Yeah, I got your I got your lunch.\" And she's like, \"Well, no, it's okay. We're not in her mind.\" She's like, \"No, we're not there yet.\" And he's like, \"Well, I really hope we're there. No, we're not. I'll pay for my own lunch. Thank you.\" You know, but you know, if the relationship is is to be, it progresses a little bit and he kind of starts to take, you know, more and more, but he doesn't have to. and and and and she and she has no claim on it's like, \"Hey, pay for me, will you?\" She's like, \"I'm not even married to you yet. We're not even engaged. What are you doing? What this whole thing's off?\" No, that's not it. It just kind of slowly gets there. But the moment they come to an altar, the moment they come into union, the moment they are united as one, everything changes. Everything. When she comes to that moment, he now assumes all her needs, everything. There's no way he can disassociate himself from it. And she has all claim. Honey, I have a great need. And he says, \"Here I am. I am everything you need. All that I have. My whole kingdom is yours. Not even up to half. Everything. Everything changes there. So the resources of your husband is at your disposal. Amen. She don't beg no more. Can I please get a hundred bucks? No, that's not how God works. Well, I put you on a budget, hun. Uh, looks like you're stuck to uh $10 more dollars this month and you're getting ain't no more food for this house. And if the kids starve, tough luck. I don't know if you're running home that way. That's all right. I'm not here. That's the pastor's job. But I know my God. Don't run my union with him as my husband, as his bride. He don't run that with me. Say, \"Oh, God, I'm in need. I've been here before. I'm needing you greatly this morning. My household or or my this or my job or I'm in a need of this. I'm in great financial need. I need a job. Oh, God. Would you come? Would you provide for me? My family, my my loved ones have gone astray. I need you to step and intervene.\" Well, you've been here before in prayer, and I've heard you time and time again, and it's just done and over. All right. No, that is not how it works. All the resources of heaven are at your disposal. Thank you, Lord. Brother Brandham says in a quote, he says, \"Now, brethren, when the brethren receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, this is the summit. This is all of it.\" He says, \"But brethren, that's wrong. There's no summit to God's power. We move on and on. It's the unlimited resources of God has never been tapped. Yet blessings and power that we know nothing about. I say get on your knees. I say cry out to your husband that you've united with. Say, \"Oh God, you're the untapped resource. I need more.\" He says, \"I have it. I have it.\" You haven't even begun to tap into the resources of glory. Amen. It's at your disposal. But have you asked him recently? Don't be shy. Don't be bashful. Maybe like Jehoshaphat, you need to cry out. So, oh God, I need your intervention right now. He's just waiting. You know when blind Barameus was there at the gate and he was going to cry out the crowd is shouting and yelling and Baram speaks about him being distance away Barameus voice could never get through the crowd and he says that faith reached out to him. I just wonder God knows all things and he must have been walking away and he's like two one zero there it is finan waiting for the cry. I just wonder whose cry he's waiting for right now. He knows this is welling up like Jehoshaphat's cry. And you come to that moment and say, \"Oh, God.\" Maybe not audibly, but maybe from here, from your heart, you start to cry out cuz he's here. He's here to answer your need. I don't serve a God that's disappeared since Calvary. I don't believe in a God that disappeared since 1965. I don't believe a God that disappeared since yesterday. He's here today. He's here today. A limitless God. Oh my, I just got too much here. I need to move on. My I'm so sorry. what that union does. You know, when there's union, inside of that bride is certain potentials and inside of the groom is certain potentials, but they can't be made manifest until there's a union. They can sit there dormant for so long. And inside is better brand scriptures, there was the promised seed inside of Abraham. But it needed to become manifest. It was sitting there. And there were certain attributes of Sarah, but they needed to be combined. And there's attributes in him that he needs you to be made manifest throughout. That's right. That's what this message came here at this hour to bring a union. Brother Brandham even says in a quote, he says that Jesus, there were certain parts of his ministry that he could not fulfill and he's left it for you. That to me is powerful. And I've thought about that here. Jesus Christ, the creator said, \"No, there's a portion of my ministry that I need to leave to my bride.\" Amen. What a responsibility you have to now complete the ministry of Jesus Christ living in flesh today. Amen. That puts a responsibility on our shoulders. Say, Lord, that that's what you're asking of me. Yes. Because every bride walks, wherever she walks, she carries the identity of her husband. She represents him everywhere she goes. And you represent him everywhere you go. I'll even read this scripture as we wind down here now. the kingdom of heaven and all of its power. Think about the kingdom of heaven and all of its power. That's a big phrase because my mind actually stops somewhere. What is all the power of heaven? Luke 17:20 says, \"And when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of heaven of God should come, he answered them and said, 'The kingdom of God cometh not with observation. Neither shall they say, low here or low there, for behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\" God has placed all the power of heaven in you. That is to me powerful. Satan took Jesus up on the mountain. Abraham said showed him all the kingdoms of the world. He said Jesus said, \"Get thee hence behind me, Satan.\" That's right. He wasn't he wasn't care. He said, \"If the kingdom of this world, I could call legions of angels, but my kingdom is not of this world, but my kingdom is in heaven.\" And he said, \"The kingdom of God will be within you.\" So therefore, the legions and powers of the backing of the holy angels, he says, \"Hallelujah is in you.\" Was born into the deity of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Yes sir. Who are you this morning? Who is Christ Jesus? He's in you as much as you'll let him be. He's pressing, trying to get into you, to move into you today. And you stand off and wonder and look and gaze and hold back a little. Don't do that. He said, \"Move straight into the kingdom of God.\" The hour is here. The hour for the power of Almighty God, all of heaven's forces, the angels, and the power thereof is right here, pressing into you and me to say, \"Go be my representation. be my bride. Finish my ministry. [Applause] That's what the union has come to do. To get you to remember where you came from so that you and all the power of heaven can end this final age with your shoulders back. Young people walking in a gross darkness and say, \"I'm sorry, devil, but you cannot have me because I'm a son of God. Abraham says, \"Listen closely. The kingdom of God is his word made power.\" If you want to put that down, he says, \"The kingdom of God is God's word made power.\" What is the kingdom of God? Is within you. The kingdom's in you. And when the word comes in, what does the word begin? It turns itself into power, making it say just exactly what it said. Amen. That's why he says, \"Take no thought for what you should say because he is the power within you that is making sure you say what it said.\" You know, I think of all the resources of the enemy's kingdom. Satan needs a vessel. Legion was a vessel that he could express his demonic power through for a period of time. Pharisees were a vessel to express his religious demonic powers. Caesar was a vessel to express political demonic powers. They were all Satan's powers uniting with a vessel to express the attributes from in Satan's kingdom. And if that's how Satan works, we know that that's the perversion of how God manifests because God is desiring a uniting. God is desiring to manifest his own power. And if Satan has billions and billions of people to manifest his attributes through willing, they're willing to unite with that power. And you look at all of those, they're they're they're given over in such desire and they give themselves heart, soul, everything they have, and they throw themselves into everything that Satan is drawing them towards. I thought, \"Oh, God, if that's what Satan's people are willing to and desiring to unite, surely there's a people.\" What about the vessels of God that are desiring with everything within them to say, \"Oh God, I desire to unite with the Christ, the son of the living God, be expressed through me.\" Oh, I sure hope God isn't short changed that he's like, \"Is there is there one? Is there just is there two Satan all through the world? Billions of people that he's just expressing through. Look at that. Look at that attribute.\" And God is saying, \"Is there anybody willing to give themselves so surrendered, so surrendered to set aside everything of this world? I desire union. I've come with this age. I've come with this message. I've brought a prophet down your down in your day. I've preserved all that he said. There's a voice in this hour so that you could know where you came from. So that you could desire. Is anybody prerecting your heart?\" God is saying, \"Anybody, anybody, do you desire to unite with me?\" And I can imagine Satan strutting through all humanity saying, \"Look at all mine. Look at all mine.\" He said, \"Lord, this morning, if you could walk through this little service, you can say, \"Look at all mine. Look at all mine. The fairest of 10,000. their beauty beyond no beauty. I said, Lord, that's what I want to be identified with. I just want to surrender it all. I want you to be able to unite with this being, this vessel, this soul crying out, oh God, in this last day. I don't want any area of my life. If I need to shutter it, I need to cast this aside or that aside or this interest or that interest. I need to check my gauges. Lord, I want you to have full access to everything this being can be. Empty me out so that you may pour in. That's my cry this morning as we stand this morning. Is that your cry? Is that your desire? Say, \"Oh God, I want to be a willing vessel. I want to I desire, Lord, that there's something I need a uniting awaken to me my identity this morning.\" If that's your crying, you call out to him. Maybe you need to be like a Jehoshaphat this morning and say, \"Oh God, I'm in a fix this morning. I'm in a situation. Can you just please help me if that's your need? You just pray to him. I don't need to pray for you. I'll pray, but you pray too. You say, \"Lord, this is my need.\" Why don't you bow your heads this morning? Heavenly Father, Lord, there indeed is billions and billions of people and Satan has his hands on so many. And Lord, it's like he has just full access to to all the things of this world and to present his enticements. But Lord, there is indeed a people. It's a small little group. Your prophet said a little, very, very, very few. Because Lord, you've chosen a little elect lady to be a representation of your pure word in this hour. Lord, we lift our hands as we see the world is uniting. Rome is uniting. The Aoda churches are uniting. If that's in the negative, there's got to be the positive that's happening. You're bright around this world. We're not uniting on our ideas. We're not uniting on some false idea what this message is. We're uniting on the true word alone. on what this word pure word of the hour Lord cast aside we cast aside everything that's contrary to your word this morning and may you have your way move and deal Lord I pray amongst your people that Lord we could be so surrendered your prophet oh what an example he was that he was so surrendered that Lord you could work through him Lord we're not prophets but we're your bride and we desire oh that you could complete the ministry that Lord you've given to us to complete in this last stage, Lord, that we could be eternal life, bearers of eternity, Lord, amongst the dark hour. I commit your people, Lord, into your hand. May you bless them this morning. Would you touch their hearts in Jesus Christ's holy name? Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you, Lord. Oh, don't you appreciate the word of the Lord today? This is your house. Let's sing it together. Father, come and dwell. This is your house, a holy house. Well, the lost and the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their cares. This is your house. This is your house. Come and [Music] dwell. Let's just worship him now.

And we're going to have you, if you would, to just lay your hand over on the person standing there by you on the shoulder. Take him by the hand. If you don't feel comfortable, if it's a sister or whatever, you can move if you'd like. Jesus said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe. If you notice, he didn't just limit it to the preachers. Only God knows how many sick are here today. Maybe how many weary. Maybe some of you that are facing decisions in your life and you feel the spirit of God spoke to you this morning from what you heard. Now remember, Brother Michael and I did not sit down and talk together. Now, Brother Michael preached this, preach that, preach something else. But I know as the pastor, God used our brother here today to speak the very secrets of people's hearts. That's the discernment I believe in in this hour. The word is a discerner. Let's just pray for each other, shall we? Heavenly Father, as your prophet would have the people to do this multiple times and he would say eagle to eagle, believer to believer, Lord God, you see the needs of your children today. Hundreds of your people gathered here in this place. We believe that you've spoken to us. Lord, you spoke to me. I believe that you spoke to many, many more. Oh Jesus, we as American citizens, for those of us who are as our brother brought it so beautifully to us, Lord, our Declaration of Independence and Lord, our Bill of Rights and all that's given to us as believers, it parallels spiritually of what you've done for us. Oh God, I pray for your children today. Lord, in the name of Jesus, for those who are sick and need healing in their body, those who are oppressed of the devil, we say to your enemy and our enemy, take your hands off of God's property in the name of Jesus, sickness and disease and anxiety and suicide, may it leave the children of God right now in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, maybe there's some here today and they've tried and tried to press through and they just can't break it. But may the chain be broken right here today in the presence of Almighty God. Father, we pray for one another. Lord, for the young, for the elderly, for the sick, for the weary, whatever they are. We don't want to just limit it now to the visible audience, but for those who have streamed, those who go back and archive. Lord, may the power of God just fill their car so much they'll have to pull over on the side of the road while the anointing of the Holy Ghost comes inside their car, inside their home, inside their office. Lord Jesus, you see your bride has so many needs in this hour. May the glory of God overshadow the earth. Minister to the needs of your wife, heavenly father. Heal those that are sick. Deliver those that are bound. Oh granted I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the saints of God said thank you. Hallelujah. Oh we worship you Lord Jesus. Can we just lift our hands now in the presence of our great king. Whatever you had need of just tell him I receive it right now Lord. I receive healing of this cancer in my body this tumor. Whatever it is, in the name of Jesus, may it leave my body right now in Jesus Christ's name. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. We worship you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Whatever's on your heart. Amen. Praise be to God. Don't you love him today, saints? What an honor it is for us to be together in the presence of God. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord. We say to our guests today, brothers and sisters, we thank you for staying over different ministers I know that's here today. And I was thinking as our brother was speaking about things that bring us together and the school from from Cloverdale had brought uh many of these people here this weekend and they come together for what purpose to be able to see their children be able to graduate and give their appreciation to the teachers and all that. But I was thinking what a greater thing we have to come together the revealed word of this hour that God has given us. And we will fight for our rights. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. All we can do is pray for our Canadian brothers and sisters that maybe they'll become our 51st state. A minute. I'm just saying, you know, just Amen. It breaks your heart as an American citizen to see what our nation was and what it has become. I pray to God that one day we don't look back with regret and look at our message and say, \"This is what we had 30 years ago, 40 years ago, and look at what we are now. We're worldly. We're powerless. We're this or that. God forbid that that ever happens. God forbid that that ever happens. It's up to us whether it does or not. It's totally up to us as the people of God. What do we want it to be? To me, we'll still need the same power. We still need the same resurrection, the same Lord Jesus. Amen. God bless you. Harry, sing something for us. Let's just sing a little bit before we go. There's two times that a preacher wants to preach. That's when a preacher gets up and can't preach. when a preacher gets up and can preaches something. You know which one that was today. Thank you, brother Michael. God bless you. We're so appreciate you being here. Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you. I give myself away. Yes, Lord. Let's just sing this before we go, can we? I give myself away. So you there's anything you can't I give myself away. [Music] I don't have much Lord. You can take it, Father. I give myself away so you can use me. Here I am. Here I am. Here I stand. Lord, my life is in your hand. Lord, I'm going to see your desires revealed in me. I give myself [Laughter] [Applause] away. I give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. I give myself away. know you can use me. Take my heart. Take my life as a livinging sacriice. Oh my. Oh yes Lord I place him in your hands. I give myself away. I give myself away. Oh, you can use me. I give myself [Music] away. I give myself away so you can use [Music] me. My life is not my own. To you I belong. Lord I give myself I give myself to you. Oh my life is not my own to you. I belong. Lord I give myself. Amen. I give myself. Mean it with all your heart as we sing it. Hallelujah. is not mine. My life is not mine, Lord Jesus. You I belong. I give myself. I give myself to you. I give myself away. Hallelujah. Make your offering to him this morning. Raise your hands there. Give Jesus the offering of yourself. He don't want your money. He don't want your car. He wants you. Give yourself to it. Oh, grab it, Lord God. Give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. Lord, I don't know how much more life I have left over. How much strength I have, God, but I give it to you. Take me, Lord. Take every person here for granted. Lord, I give myself away. So you can use me. Our father, we thank you for this weekend. We're so grateful that we could be able to spend time together. Some of these graduates, Lord, the farthest traveled was a family from New Zealand, some from the east, some from out west, some from Canada, different places. For some of them, it was the first time in life they had ever met. And in my mind, I think of what your prophet said. One of these days, hallelujah, we will get together with the rest of the group and we will come up missing on the earth. the resurrection will take place. And he he called it a sweep that would come over us and in a moment we'll be changed and we're getting together with the rest of the group, Lord. People that we've never met, people that we've not even known in life, but we're getting together in another dimension. And he said, we come up missing on the earth. Then we know it won't be long. We'll be traveling like a salt. Father, may there not be a one of us missing, Lord. Oh, we believe that's a prayer that's according to your word. For every name is written in that lamb's book of life. Not a one has ever been taken out, or shall they ever be. We may never gather again quite like this, but Lord Jesus, we're longing for that time when we'll gather together up at your house. Go with those, Father, that'll be traveling back, flying, driving, whatever they will be. Give them of your traveling mercy until we meet together again, if not in this life, before your throne, Lord. Granted, I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen. God bless you. Would you just turn around, shake hands with somebody, two or three people around you there, it's been good to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. God bless you. God bless each of you. Thank you for coming and spending this time with us here in Tennessee. We're so grateful to have all of you. Sing again, every whatever is on your heart. God bless you. Let's sing together as we go and you'll be dismissed in the fear of God. Come. Hallelujah. Sweet Jesus. Yes, Lord. Come take me away. I really don't belong here now. I want to see your face. Come sweet [Music] Jesus, come take me away. I really want to see you, Lord. Jesus, come to come. Sweet Jesus, take me from this [Music] place. I really don't belong here now. I want to see your face. Come, sweet Jesus. Come take me away. Oh, I really want to see you, Lord. Jesus, come today. Lord, you made me happy. And Lord, you've been so good. Lord, you turn my life around when I didn't think you could. Now I love this life of mine. I love each passing day. Oh, but with every breath I take inside my heart I say. Oh, come sweet Jesus. Take me from this place. I really don't belong here now. I want to see your face. Oh, come sweet Jesus. Come take me away. I really want to see you, Lord. Jesus come today. Lord, we are your people preparing now to be the bride pure and holy for all the world to see. [Music] Come in clouds of angels, take us all away to the place that you've prepared a neverending day. Glory cry come sweet Jesus take me from this [Music] place I really don't belong here now I want to see your face come sweet Jesus oh Come take me [Music] away. I really want to see you, Lord.

we were here today but I'm still happy to see everyone and I know that my mama would have been happy to see you all here today tresa was uh born 58 years ago passing away on Monday she was a loving wife loving mother and a a grandmother that just was top of the line you can ask any of her kids and you can ask her daughter-in-laws and you can ask me your son-in-law and I'll tell you the honest truth she was a remarkable person and we love her still love her in preparing this speech it's never easy when reflecting on the life uh as we have to but speaking of my mother-in-law there is not enough time to get into the friendship that I had with her for nearly 30 years before I married Britney 15 years ago go I was best friends with her son Zach and Matt and she was always a mother figure to me even before I became part of the family she was always a family first woman she's married to my father-in-law for over 40 years raising three children together one of which uh turned out okay the other two she tried it's all that can be said but she wanted the best for all of them and she did her best to give it to them in our own relationship it was a few years before I knew this I I she told me this about the time me and Britney got married they had just moved to this area and were talking and she so happened to look down and saw a little boy walking down one of the aisles in a little mismatched suit and she said that's going to be my son-in-law right there 12 years later she was proven right she was always there for her kids and the only thing she loved more than them was her grandchildren and I believe that she truly with all her heart loved all of of them and she gave each of them the equal amount of love she never picked any kind of favorites every Christmas every birthday every moment was made special she was always just a phone call away with motherly advice getting into a different side of her though one of my little Parts was my mother-in-law was incredibly easy to startle and I think my brother-in-laws and I put several of the gray hairs on her head due to our more Carefree attitude and general stupidity mama and I would often get into kind of a contest on social media of who could scare the other more with uh jump scares and different videos she never won but I can still remember the all cap text that I would get back and I can still hear her scream oh gee when everything went everything started to scare she would immediately just lock up she made all of us feel special on our birthdays and Christmas every one of my birthdays I had a a box of no bakes and homemade fudge that was better than anything that Gatlinburg could have ever made and I still have my collection of pajama pants that she got us every Christmas all three of us we'll miss those little things now Jesus forgive me when Mama first got the news we all immediately started praying for healing us and all of you and people who never even had the pleasure of meeting her and I want to take this moment to say thank you to each and every one of you who took time to pray and all the prayer cloths the food everything has just been so overwhelming to my family during this time we appreciate the home visits that we that she got and the support during this this was a lot easier when I was rehearsing this in the days leading up to her passing my wife and I had a visit we just got got the news that the time was slipping and it was time to start making your final preparations and start saying your goodbyes and we went over me and my wife and Mama wasn't quite hadn't been quite herself she wasn't able to talk very much there was a music playing in the house and from different churches and one of the songs was Victory in Jesus was playing and the last thing that I actually got to hear her say fully was she raised those little hands and said victory is mine mama raised her feeble hands and said that in front of all of us to all of you who prayed for her healing and to all of us who had hoped the situation would turn out different in healing I'd like to remind you all of something today God did heal her cancer has never had a victory over a child of God mama just went home thank you [Music] life is easy when you're up on the mountain you've got peace of mind like you never know but then things [Music] change you're down in the [Music] valley but don't lose faith for you're never alone for the God on the mountain is still God in the [Music] valley when things go wrong he make make them right and the god of the good times is still God in the bad times the god of the day is still God in the night [Music] oh you talk of Victory when you're up on that mountain oh but t comes so easy when life sad it's B but it's down in the valley [Music] of Trials and [Music] temptations and that's where your faith is put to the test oh but the God all the [Music] mountain is still God in The Valleys when things they go wrong he'll make them rise and the god of the good times is still God in the bad times and the god of the [Music] day is still God in the night oh the god of the day is still God in the night [Music] I know your life own Earth Earth

great time wish you were here it never rains and no one complains we haven't seen a tear oh oh having a great time and we wish you were here [Music] certainly wish to extend our condolences this evening to the family and friends of our dear departed sister it's been a privilege to be able to know the Willis family um for all the years that we've been together and so thankful for the opportunity to be able to lead them into the Paths of Heaven brother Eric we good testing one two use the handhel test test test okay now I got it sorry about that it's been a great privilege for me to be able to um know the Willis family when they moved here several several years ago from Kentucky and these young men and young woman that you see here with a little bit of ot9 things and we've been through a lot of hard trials and tests together of life I want to speak to you for just a few minutes this evening on from dust to Glory Genesis 1: 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over all the Earth over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he them male and female created he them in Genesis 2:7 and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground so wonder what kind of man that was in Genesis 1 that man was made in the image of God and then God puts that man into a dust body and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathes into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul so there are most two different types of men that were in the Garden of Eden we look at ourselves today as human beings and we can see that there is a Supernatural part about us a part that does not die when you came around by today and shook the hands of the family and expressed your heartfelt condolences to them and walked by this cast actually what you saw was an empty house a house that was inhabited just a few days ago by another being a being that is not dead according to Genesis 3: 19 after the fall when God had spoke to man and said in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread and till thou returned to the ground for for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and to dust thou shal return but what part goes back to dust the part that came from dust but where is the other part the man that God created in His image that had that Supernatural part so when our sister tresa was able to make peace with God so many many years ago and be able to pass from Death unto life the Old Testament view of death was very very vague very unclear even to the prophets the sages the righteous men that love God job said it this way in job chap 10 ver 20 are not my days few cease then and let me alone that I may take comfort a little before I go when I shall not return even to a land of darkness the shadow of death job is a great man in his day but death was still so obscure they didn't know where you went they didn't understand and he said a land of Darkness as Darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order where the light is as Darkness Psalm 654 in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give thee thanks Psalms 55:4 my heart is sore pain was meant Within Me and the Terrors of death are Fallen upon me so it was a world an experience that man didn't know anything about and is in indeed man's greatest fear there's something in us and I think of the great creator of God that whenever we see an urgent situation that within 3/4 of a second from the time that we see somebody stop in front of us our body is able to synchronize together with the brain through the tissues and the nerves and all that sort of thing and we can take our foot off the gas and put her foot on the brake um when God made man that didn't have cars and they didn't have people that drive the way people do today but I'm sure go go God made us with that in mind aren't you we'd been a mess today but you think of how that man was so hidden from the view of death when the Lord Jesus came to the Earth he totally changed the view of death look at this in Matthew chapter 9: 24 he said unto them give place for the maid is not dead but sleepest so this was a little girl that had died what we call death and the Lord Jesus said something that was so peculiar and so odd and he said hey hey everybody calm down the little girl ain't dead she's just sleeping and they laughed him to scorn so they made fun of the Lord Jesus and laughed at him and said are you you kid who do you think you are well he knew who he was and he knew the difference between death and eternal separation now he knew that this little girl even though they said she was dead in the way that he looked at it she was not dead at all now as we look at this empty house here this afternoon and we know we call it death and we've all had our acquaintance with death and our heart has been torn from us by facing one death after another after another from our families and our friends but we know our sister Tressa did not die and the reason of that is because she has already died she already face death and by facing that death and accepting the life of the Lord Jesus she can never die again you imagine as the Lord Jesus looked upon them and St John 11 some dear close friends of the Lord Jesus sent him a message and it was about one of his intimate friends this man's name was Lazarus his sisters Mary and Martha sent a messenger and they said Lazarus is very sick and would would you come now they had fors in their churches of that day they had already borne a great reproach for the Lord Jesus and You' think if you was a friend to the Lord Jesus that he would do something so special for you and you see this is where many people misunderstand even when a child of God is allowed to go through so much suffering and people will look and from their mind they're trying to comprehend why would a loving God ever allow his children to go through so much stuff and you're saying why don't he just heal all them and then let all the Sinners and all them Wicked people out there let them go through all the terrible things because God knows he can use his children to prove certain things about his word that he can never use a sinner to prove you know it's amazing that God sometimes will answer prayers within 24 hours of the time we pray many of you probably like myself have seen him answered prayers in the matter of moments and watch what he did my wife called her mother yesterday in Kentucky very very sick and she called her in a few moments we had prayer for her sitting at the kitchen table and she talked to her again today and she said after you all prayed for me she said I turned off the phone and went to sleep immediately and she was testifying to the nurses and stuff where she was it was immediate it was much faster than I could drive 4 and 1/2 hours to be able to get to Kentucky but yet there's times God will answer immediately there's times God will say wait a while and then there's heartbreaking times when God will say no I'm not going to answer this prayer for you and all for for Christians and especially for those that don't understand they look at and say how could he do that because they measure God's love by their love so they look at their children and they think if my child was in a dilemma and my child was in a terrible situation there's no way I would let my child go through that I would reach down there and I'd do whatever I could but see you're measuring God's love by your love I've been a pastor of a church for many many years many decades I'm 68 years old I've been preaching since I was 18 and I've seen folks go through things that I have to tell you as far as a preacher I would have stopped it I would have held it off held it away from them and no doubt I would have made the biggest mess of their life because I'm looking at them with human sympathy and human compassion and I say I would stop them from that I'd never let them go through that I would never let them go through that part no way but God and his wisdom looks and sees that when we go through things he can bring us out on the other side and we will be able to testify of what Grace what mercy and what strengths that he brought us through you see there's been many people that has preceded our our sister tresa I read about them in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 called the faith chapter of the Bible and it begins to list many of them by name and it tells the various things that they went through and they trusted God and they believed God it gives several examples of God answering their prayers and how that God moved for them and wrought a great Deliverance but then it also tells about other people but God didn't answer them that way so there's certain people he will be able to prove his great power one of our sisters right here in the church several months ago passed away right back here in church when service was going on we have some nurses here at the church they went back there we began to pray for her and God spared her life the spirit of God moved for her we've seen so many miracles that God has done right here and at the same time we've had so many funerals so the same God that will raise the dead for some of his children he will let them go through the passage of the Valley of the shadow of death all of us are not called to fulfill the exact same scope in the economy of God there will be many many that love the Lord Jesus with all of their heart and they trusted him to deliver them of that sickness that disease whatever they were dealing with until the last breath left their body and people say well cancer got the best of them oh no no it didn't as a matter of fact I want to tell you T today that disease that riddled our sister's body and all that she went through it is not the Victor today because when life went from her body all them cells that was trying to multiply and take her life and so on what happened to all of them they are the one ones who died not our sister tresa as a matter of fact if we could move from this Earthly house here let us take a little brief brief travel we will go into where she was when she brother Randy told me that the night before probably the same situation the brother Philip was talking about that they was playing music and she had raised her hands up and her feeble hands that had been weakened by so much suffering and all that she went through but able to praise the Lord and love the Lord and worship him so what happened to that part so the part that motivated That animated her hands that animated her mouth to speak and to continuously hold on to the promise of God where is that person where is that image of that person that was doing that oh he say it's here no no it's not here something left this all this is is a house just like this building here it was empty several hours ago people begin to come in pay their respects in a little bit it'll be empty again where's the noise coming from in this building coming from singers preachers people well why don't the building itself make all them voices it has no ability to do so it's only concrete material that was put together to make a building that we call a church but this building has no animation and no life on its own and when life went out of this body what happens she can't even move a finger no longer bat an eye no longer make a smile or a frown but the real person that we're talking about today is part of that image that God made in Genesis 1 you see our body is like an Earthly house and Paul talked about it in 1 Corinthians 1547 the first man is of the Earth's earthy and it is simply made of Earth the second man is the Lord From Heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are Earthly as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly this Tabernacle that we live in is simply dust but where's the star part you see God gave Abraham two great shadows and types and every called him he said I want you to look up here to the stars and count them if you can and he said that's the way your seed will be then he brought him to the seashore and he Saidi want you to count the dust the grains of sand if you can that's the way your seed will be so from dust to stars from Genesis 1 to Genesis 2 and Paul says it this way for if this Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a build building of God an house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens so in this we do grown Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven and if so being found clothed he said we will not be found naked at that day so when this Supernatural part that come out of this Tabernacle sister tresa the real one where did it go what happened to it is she a ghost today just a spirit that might appear and disappear and we may never see her again is that is that what she is no no actually she moved into a body that is called theophany and the word Theo of course those of you that know your Bible Theo comes from the same word that we use for deity Theos so it is a body that was made eternal in the heavens so when the life on out of this body it simply changed houses what sister tresa did on Monday was changed addresses God gave her many years ago an address change notification it was in the form of the Gospel she heard that and something touched her heart she'd been working on on that Journey ever since getting ready to move so instead of when she came down to death screaming hollering crying oh God I'm lost oh God I'm lost somebody help me somebody help me pull me out of the flames of fire no she didn't have to do that she could just simply take her last breath and all of a sudden she stepped out of this house now if you can imagine all that our poor sisters went through as my wife and I went to see them week before last and uh we were just both in shock how much she had changed since the last time we'd seen her brother Randy but just beyond this Veil is another body she'll never have another pain another heartache another sorrow you see the very same event that happened on Monday when the Bible tells us in the Book of Psalms precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints precious was it precious to you all humanly we cry we we feel like something's been taken from us how can the same event be so precious and so heartbreaking to us if we could break in and talk to our sister brother Randy told me the other day and I talked to him my wife Carol and I talked about the same thing I've heard it from two or three people that maybe one of the first ones that when our sister tresa was able to step across Paul likened death to a simple Journey he said the time of my departure is at hand the word that Paul used was a Greek word for shipping so it like the boat was tied to the Moorings the ropes were tied the boat had been loaded the captain was on board the merchants everything was in line and then all of a sudden they say let's go they loose the ropes from the big post which are buried feet in the ground and the ship begins to let go out into the waters and he said the time of my departure is at hand for just a moment before I close let us imagine our sister's heart rate begins to change her blood pressure she's getting to where she can't hear anymore and this Mortal realm skipping breaths she's never been here quite like this before but all of a sudden from another realm that realm becomes more real than this one and she feels herself as it were a vapor which is what the Bible says that we are like a vapor it begins to lift from the Earth's this body here like the morning fog and when the sun begins to shine upon it and it will cause it to just disappear in one moment she was in This Old House and the next moment she was on board the ship of Zion didn't take her 24 hours didn't take her 24 minutes but just in a moment like as soon as she stepped into the ship and she disembarked the ship let's just watch her as she she steps out as she sets her foot upon the shore and she looks around and she sees colors like she's never seen before the sun was unlike anything she'd ever seen the skies the the grass and here comes somebody running there might have been several some from this side some from that side some from that side but I could see one maybe about that tall her long hair hanging Plumb down past her knees her arms out my precious sister who is it oh my goodness it's my daughter Erica sister tresa prayed for her so much there's another one and another one and another one and sister Trestle looks around and she realizes iaz made it I've made it I'm not sure that her and Erica have stopped running yet since she got there my friends if you and I could only be allowed a few minutes to see that land and what awaits us nothing we go through in this life would ever compare to that world to be honest with you I'm glad I can't really see that world all the time I catch glimpses of it every now and then when I preach a funeral or when I'm studying or praying but I'm glad that I I don't have constant access because it would make me why I would be so Heavenly minded I wouldn't be one bit of Earthly good but I know it's there waiting for us sister Tressa would you want to come back oh brother Donnie I've heard you preach about it so much I've heard other preachers preach about it but take my word word for it you don't have a clue what it's like I've already met the CH J's messenger I've met people from our church and the amazing thing about it is brother Donnie we're all the same age there's no babies there's no real old people we're all the same age it's just hard to imagine the flowers and the colors everything it's just I I don't have the word and I've experiened such love I I felt it from time to time in church and i' I'd feel it I could just feel a little bit of it but it is beyond comprehension sister Trester is there anything you'd want me to say to your family tell them to do everything they can to be ready tell them to meet me I'll be waiting for them at the river as God sent me some people down at the river to welcome me I'll be waiting for them may God and His Mercy comfort chch your hearts and help you as only he can I don't know exactly how you all feel today I've still had my wife but I've lost a mother a father Aunts Uncles a daughter but I know it may feel like that there's a hole in your heart there and nobody will ever be able to feel that for you and that is that is true but the Lord God can help Comfort us through these Hard Times until we're able to meet again may God bless each of you and strengthen you and help you is my prayer can we just bow our heads together I know this might seem unusual but with their heads bowed and no one looking around is there would there be anybody here today that would say I want to meet her but I'm I'm not I'm not ready really I know I'm not would you pray for me we won't embarrass you I promise you God bless you God bless you make preparation that wouldn't be my advice Hallelujah have hely father as we come to celebrate this life we know really that a Christian preaches their own funeral it's an honor to be able to stand and try to say something about your children that have lived a Godly life and been faithful Lord we prayed and we hoped and we believe that you would do a miracle for our sister and that you would let her live let her be able to enjoy her life and her children her grandchildren s Carol and I went to see her the other day and someone had made her a a little quilt a wrap of a thing and had all the pictures of the grandchildren on there and she was so proud of it but she didn't just love them here in life she wants to have them there too so I pray you'd help them Father help the parents to be able to instruct them Lord and tell them what to do so they can go where she is we can't bring her back and we wouldn't anyway we wouldn't want to call her back to this old body Lord God the best thing for us to do is just to make ready and stay ready so we can be able to meet her I pray for brother Randy I pray for the children I pray for their spouses the grandchildren the friends the other family members Lord some that couldn't even be here today for the church family God that you would help us that you'd give us strength Lord we thank you Father that there is a land beyond the river we thank you Lord Jesus that you made a way that this part of us which has been quickened to eternal life as a body that's there waiting thank you Father somewhere beyond the Jordan River there's a place Lord that we're longing to go and see help us today I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord let me just say to you that by God's grace each one of us can make the same safe passage that our sister has made and if you want to go where she is you'll have to come through the same route and there's only one way and that way is a person it's not a preacher it's not a church but Jesus Christ himself said I am the way he he's not one of the ways but I am the way the truth and the life and if you don't know him today I just just feel strangely in my heart to say this to you that it's quite simple he made the way for us and we simply accept what he has done and follow his Commandments and his truths and his word and by that if we come by this way it will guarantee us a safe passage to the other side brother Ry buddy we love you going to be praying for you and the children is that right friends when we leave here today we're not just going to walk out these doors and say okay our part's done no please please remember them that God will will give them strength [Music] somewhere just across the Jordan [Music] River there's a place to be Everlasting joy and [Music] peace the tree is blue booming there [Music] forever the CR can we sing it together forgive me I'm sorry Hallelujah that sounds like H to me like where I long to be

very happy wedding anniversary let's give them a nice hand this morning and we have a have a couple of tributes this morning we could ask every one of you and every one of you to have nice something nice to say but uh I want brother JD Whitson I want him to come here just for a minute or two he's got something he wants to say to you and then brother Harry has got a tribute to brother Donnie and sister Carol this morning also you knew about it don't act like your this is all shocked you knew about it but I appreciate these brothers Brother Jimmy's got a very very very go ahead and give him a hand a very close working relationship with her pastor and that's why I asked him to say something also outside of sister Carol brother Harry knows more and appreciates more about brother Donnie than than any of us so these brothers are going to give just a few minutes we'll go over just a few minutes but that'll be okay we're here till we leave right but JD we appreciate you buddy [Applause] brother Harry and I didn't have much of a notice and I told Brother uh Louis that I didn't have a button in my mouth I had an m m but I'm sure that everyone in this congregation could and would give a heartfelt appreciation to brother Donnie and sister Carol on this special weekend that they're celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary and their birthday since we can't do that I guess I've been selected to as a representative to try to express that love and appreciation to both of them I know that brother Donnie and sister Carol they don't like a lot of Praise or attention thrown their way but that's just part of the humility that we've grown to to to love and admire about them you know brother Donnie as my pastor and my friend you have been the most influential person in my life I've worked very close with brother Donnie for the past 36 years as a deacon and I've seen some of the ins and outs ups and downs trying situations Corrections Restorations Grace and during all that time and during all those years I've never seen one time not one time that it's not been the character of a son of God he's always led by an example and that's what so impressed me about him I know in the very beginning that we didn't have a pastor at Happy Valley and I kept calling brother Donnie and asking me would he come and hold a service for us would he come and preach he would come and he would preach he'd go back to Kentucky I'd call him again I'd say brother Donnie would you come and hold a service for us he would come hold the service go back to Kentucky but I could tell always that his heart was on that little church in that little church in Kentucky but God had a a greater plan God had a bigger plan and he was squeezing brother Donny's heart to leave that church and come to a church that was in tremendous tremendous need and probably during one of those times when God was squeezing his heart and he was struggling or perplexed about it I gave him a call one day and asked him would he come and Minister for us a service and and I'm sure it was during that struggle that he was having he got a little ill with me he chooses to forget that day but he got a little ill with me I'm sure because of the perplexion he was going through and he said why you keep calling me and my answer to him was I believe pricked his heart I told him I said brother Donnie we're a church in great great need and if we don't have some help we'll perish I could tell immediately his demeanor changed and he said when when do you want me to come I want to thank him for obeying God you know I'll never forget those times brother Donnie and I'll never forget the pain and the courage it took for you to leave and obey God [Music] there's a song that says when words fail us listen to our heart and I know this entire congregation words would fail us brother Donnie sister Carol but if there's some way that you could hear our hearts some way possible that you could hear it our hearts would be screaming to you that we love you foreign scream out honor and appreciation for you and what you mean to us and we'd be thanking you Lord for all the labor all the studying that you've done to bring us Rapture readiness all the prayers all the requests for prayer in the middle of the night we Heirs of the morning all the sacrifices that you've made sacrifices from your family that you've sacrificed for our our flock here but I want to say brother Donnie sister Carol that this entire congregation will be standing at attention with great apprehension and great expectation when your name is called and those great rewards are handed out it'll be a time for us to Rejoice with you I just want you to know that you have her love and you have our hearts [Applause] I sure couldn't add anything to that but there's a couple things I've learned about Brother Louie and both of them is you don't tell him no because he'll get you one way or the other so you might as well just go ahead and do it I'd like to say that uh I think brother Donald Institute Carol for all their sacrifice what uh thought this morning I didn't put a lot of thoughts you know me I don't talk good so Paul said follow me as I follow Christ I would say for everyone of us sitting here we have no excuse we can't say well that man didn't tell me and or that man didn't live it or I saw this or that we have a great opportunity here but we also faced with truth that we don't have any excuse and uh I can't sing but I can sing better and I can talk so key of G yeah uh as brother JD just said I want to be by grace on me standing close when this is not a dream that a song was wrote about but it's a reality dreamed I went to heaven you were there with me [Music] we walked upon the streets of gold beside the crystal sea heard the angels singing someone called your name [Music] turned and saw a young man he was smiling as he came he said friend you may not know me now then he said but wait years to teach my son to school when I was only eight [Music] every week you would say a prayer before the class would start [Music] one day when you said that prayer I asked Jesus in my heart thank you forgiving to the Lord [Music] I am alive that was changed thank you forgiving to the Lord I am so glad you gave [Music] then another man stood before you [Music] said Remember the Time a missionary came to your church his pictures made you cry you didn't have much money but you gave it anyway [Music] Jesus [Music] thank you for giving to the Lord [Music] I am alive that was changed thank you for giving to the Lord I am so glad you came one by one they came as far as he I could see each life somehow touched by your generosity the little things that you had done all the sacrifices you made unnoticed on the earth in heaven now proclaimed [Music] I know up in heaven you're not supposed to cry I am almost sure there were Tears In Your Eyes as Jesus took your hand you stood before the Lord he said my child look around you great is your reward can you help me thank you [Music] I am alive that was changed [Music] for giving to the Lord [Music] I am so glad you came I am so glad you came [Music] [Applause] on how y'all think I'm going to preach after that bow Reds together Heavenly Father we love you so much today dear God we're grateful for the opportunity that we would be able to make this journey together we've been through many hard trials and sicknesses and deaths and so many things together how we long for that day when we'll all be able to stand before you the most important thing in our lives Lord is that you'll be pleased with this I know I'm satisfied with you you've been so good to me you've kept me you've helped me I just want you to be satisfied with me Lord God I'm sure that every Christian is standing here today are those under the sound of my voice that's their greatest desire to be able to hear you say those words well done two of the most powerful phenomenal words a human being can ever hear sin from almighty god well done I pray when our stories written may it be like Abraham don't mention our failures or weaknesses and times when it felt like we couldn't go on but may it be said about us too they staggered knocked at the promise of God we love you so much today Jesus thank you for your kindness to us help us Lord as we look into your word today may we be benefited by our gathering together in church today Lord it's such an honor for us to be together Lord God I pray for this prayer calls that I have Lord Brother Joel receiving this request for this young man I looked at his picture that he sent me I thought poor little guy dealing with this thing nothing but the devil to attack his body but in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God move forward every other need and requests that you're today which immediate father according to your greatness in Jesus name we pray amen well I'm just happy to be the house of the Lord [Applause] it's good to be a Christian isn't it let's turn to the Book of Romans if you would chapter 8 today and while you're turning there let me get through all the birthdays and all that sort of thing I want to wish Ashley and Courtney a happy birthday on Friday I like to wish Carol a happy 50th wedding anniversary yesterday I'd like to wish Carol a happy birthday today I'll not tell you how old she is I'd also like to wear Scotty my son-in-law happy birthday tomorrow I also like to wish Emma and Ellie a happy birthday tomorrow and anybody else that's here God bless you so when I forget this week I'm in big trouble [Music] in big trouble Romans chapter 8 verse 16. the spirit itself Bears the witness with our spirit isn't that awesome the spirit itself bearth a witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and join heirs with Christ if wow what a big little word if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together so you mean being sons and daughters and heirs and join heirs is attached has an attachment called suffering according to what Paul said for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US for the earnest expectation of the creature waiters for the manifestation of the sons of God may the Lord bless his words you may be seated I don't think there's any man that's ever really loved his wife that would not share everything that he had 50 years ago when Carol and I got married I was working at the anchor motel in Monticello Kentucky it was on Sunday they made me work on Sunday morning so Carol was anxiously awaiting for me to get off work I didn't have much to give her I had no home she had a rambler an American Rambler anybody know what them are antiques now wish we had that car she had an American Rambler and I had a 53 Ford truck we didn't have a house to live in I had no money and nothing to give her no insurance and I do not preach this is the way you're supposed to marry a woman I was in ignorance but I was greatly in love but what I had was hers you're laughing right you think what you just told us you didn't have anything well no I didn't but I I had my heart and my loyalty and my love and my integrity she's had that all these years I know it don't seem not much to you but it was all that I had and it's who I was so for some whenever they get married the marry a rich man's son it's Dad's a corporate guy flies on private jets rubs shoulders with the up and up people knowing by name been to the White House a few times or maybe he's a local businessman you're in Johnson City the people on the boards know him and people seem and shake his hand and speak to him and he has a reputation and his wife is not ashamed to say well who's your husband who you married to well I'm married to so-and-so oh yeah I've heard of him led a big guy with the Johnson City song yeah yeah that's my husband but what if we could be married to the king of the universe who owns everything not only owns it but made it then he would want to share what he is and what he has with us would he not I mean your brothers felt that way mother wife you married whatever you had not only from that point but from that point on whatever you would have you would give to her there's a lady at TJ Maxx showing Johnson City and she's worked there for years and years and for years Carol and I have been there and this lady has watched the purchases that we have made of course I'm surrounded by women married a wife thank God two daughters six granddaughters three sets of twins so a big portion of the purchases that we have made there have been women's dresses girls dresses women's shoes girls shoes women's girls women's girls so one day this lady asked me she said don't you ever get anything so I said yes ma'am every now and then I do I said but me and my wife we made this agreement whenever we got married how many ever years ago whenever I told this to her probably 10 or 12 years ago I said we made this agreement that every saying would be 50 50. so she's just standing there waiting for the rest of the story and I told her our agreement was it would be fifty dollars for her 50 cents for me I can see some of your sisters like that agreement sorry Brothers sorry brother Timothy and you know when I look at it was the Lord I don't feel like it's fifty dollars and 50 cents I feel like it would be more like 500 trillion dollars that I get and he gets a nickel from me now maybe some of you have a higher esteem of yourself than I do but the closer I get to him the more I realize how little I've done for it I used to your brother brandemus he would say that he had set back up on the headboard and put his hands behind his head something like this I would imagine and he was began to think about that song Lord let me look past the curtain of time and as he did a voice said would you like to look past the curtain of time and he said yes it would help me so much and as he lay there he thought boy your past 50 years old you haven't done anything for God now listen past 50. by that time Millions had already been touched by his ministry thousands had been saved thousands had received the Holy Ghost thousands times thousands have been led to the Lord and as I first come to the message in Nigerians say that you remember about the time frame it was in early 1960 when he had this visitation I thought well you know maybe it was just him saying that in a humble way but as I learned more about him and about his ministry I realized no that wasn't him saying it in a humble way that's the way he thought about himself and I've realized great people the closer they get to God it's not the bigger they think they are it's the smaller they realize they are you see those who think they are so great and just go on and on and on about themselves whether or not you understand it it shows us the true picture that person isn't very close to God at all because if we ever get very close to him we'll realize how great and wonderful that he really really is how insignificant and how small and what little we all have done and yet when we stand there that day brother George Burcham which used to come to the church I Pastor in Kentucky he lived there in a little place called Albany Kentucky brother Branham came to his house 1965. brother George had a cheese plant where they made the cheese and the curd stage and the raw stage and real fine crumbly looking stuff brother random came there and brother George and his wife liked Antiques and he came to brother George's house brother George said he wouldn't even sit in the furniture he sat on the floor and set cross-legged like an Indian and he would cross his legs and sit there they tried begged him to sit on the furnace no no no no is that such pretty pretty stuff I I wouldn't want to sit on that so he sits in the floor brother George said he was a type of a man that would talk about you and make you think you were so great and you were just sold this and that I wonder sometimes if we understand what greatness really is and yet this great one the Lord Jesus that we're talking about wants to share everything he has with us and he doesn't want to wait till the other side for everything to be shared but alas there are some things that cannot be shared until we get to the other side much of what we get is absolutely given to us as a free gift with no work no praying no fasting no labor on our part but there are some things that he wants to give us that requirements are made and one of these rights that he wishes to share with his bride is the right to reign to be on a throne with him to him that overcome us will be granted the right the privilege the honor to set with him and his throne as he has overcome and sat down with his father in his throne can you and I imagine this morning that when the Rapture takes place this word will so make us ready we will go straight from Johnson City Kingsport Bristol wherever it is you live straight from this world into the presence of God and will we will be so prepared by the word and the ministry that God's given you will need no supplements you will need nothing along the way between here and Heaven to make you a better person to finish up what you've liked this word will produce such a character of people in one moment you are a mortal facing all kinds of battles all kinds of Trials and then the next moment you will be standing there in a body that is made like unto his own glorious body you will then be changed and brought into the court of his majesty I'm not talking about now a place where a judge is or maybe a mayor and a few years ago or brother Mike Walsh took us to the White House and we was able to go to the White House and see some of the different famous people and while I was standing there the vice president at the time Mike Pence came out and was shaking hands with the people and I got to shake his hand the Bodyguards of course all around him and they rushed him through and I have to say that was quite an honor seeing people that are the rich and the famous but who are they compared to Jesus you and I were never more than likely be allowed allowed to to the White House would never be a personal guest of the president or of some great person and yet the greatest one that ever lived invites you daily into his courts and what's so sad is there's days that go by and we don't even go we don't even use that opportunity that is given to each of us to come into the presence of almighty God and I find that so amazing that he understands the Frailty and the weakness of our Humanity and he loves us in spite of ourself aren't you glad he does the Paul when he Taps into this in verse 17 he said if children than air is Heirs of God in John heires with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together I want you to notice how Paul so they'll use the word prudently as he sets Force this High exalted position he elevates them to this top part of this verse notice what he does before he introduces the word suffer he elevates them to a position that only God could do so he says that if children than heirs Heirs of God join heirs was Christ and he goes from that to the very next part of this verse if so be that we suffer he didn't mention the suffer part first but he mentioned the great elevation that God had given by grace then he brings in the painful part the higher Joy the higher glorification first then the pain then the suffering the pleasure the happiness the extreme joy and then the pain the suffering how many suffered as a Christian if you've been saved very long I guarantee you you have what's amazing is that all of those of us who suffer as being a Christian that is attributed for the sake of the Gospel now whether you're a young sister that is laughed at because of your hair your dress because you don't have makeup whether you're a young boy that's like that because you don't talk and drink and cuss and act like the other young boys at school or at college where you go whatever it is that you go through the Lord Jesus actually attributes that to your account as if so it was himself being persecuted again so everything that you go through Peter says it this way in First Peter chapter 4 verse 16 yet if any man suffer as a Christian now all of us suffer things that are self-inflicted we can do some pretty dumb stuff can't we well come on be honest we have all done pretty dumb stuff we've acted dumb we've taught them we've just acted you know pretty ignorant sometimes and then we've suffered because of that but you're not suffering because you're a Christian when you do something stupid that's your own stupidity and mine right but now Peter wants to characterize and show them the differentiation between them doing something and messing up and then suffering a persecution because of it or if any man will suffer as a Christian now notice what we're supposed to do if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this behalf now I'm not sure about you but I'm still working on the last part of that verse because there's a reproach there's a pain there's can be great sorrow and difficulty in suffering for the cause of Christ now some would take this as if though that it's only say Martyrs or only those that are persecuted because they're a preacher but not so you see God will commit some to death God will commit some to suffering in their body he himself has the power to heal them what are you about to say a word all you have to do is just look the direction that thing would be gone but he actually incorporates their life into bringing glory to God by bearing something sometimes for many years and yet it is attributed to bringing glory and honor to the kingdom of God term limited John chapter 9. a very familiar story that all you Bible readers know and I'm sure you'll love it John chapter 9 it is about the blind man and as Jesus passed by saw a man which was blind from his verse now let's get the setting we don't know exactly how old the man was but it's not considered a boy or a use he's actually identified as a man and if you read whenever you want to on down of course to verse 7 8 9 10 on down you'll find I think it's in verse 8 that the Bible says that he set there as a beggar now I want you to say the background of this is he was born blind he had never seen in his entire life so he was blind from his verse and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind Jesus answered neither had this man sin nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him so you mean this man sat there for years for years waiting for the works of God to be made manifest in his life I wonder how much he was ridiculed how he was laughed at now this man as far as we know ever become a preacher but yet the Lord God was able to do something through his life that he never done through Peter and that was that the works of God you see God needed someone in this kind of condition what couldn't the Lord have allowed some accident to happen just say a week prior to this and the man will say fell out of a tree and got a concussion and he lost his sight and he couldn't see well he went to one doctor another said you know what it looks like that you're just blind for the rest of your life and it only happened a week ago well then Jesus would have come to town a week later and the man would have come up and the prayer line is would say and the Lord Jesus would have healed the man and his suffering would have been very short-lived huh but every local person knew this man so the links of time was a further Vindication of the glory and the power of God now had he fallen out of a tree or some type of freak's accident that the people said well his sight just come back well the doctor would have said well why sure yeah we've seen that before that's what it was but God wanted it to be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was the Healer but have you ever thought about the pain this man must have bore to give God these years of his life how many Summers was he robbed how many beautiful flowers he never got to see maybe he would ask people what does the sun look like I feel it I feel that I come here early in the morning and I shiver in the cold and it's chilly but I can feel something as it touches my skin and warms my hand and I feel it as it moves up to my arm and then touches my face well that's the sun well what does it look like exactly well it's a great bright ball in this in the sky and it's great Illuminating Light and and then well tell me tell me something else what's that I hear oh that that's a bird a bird what kind of collar I don't know it's just a bird you know people like us that see it every day and we don't even pay no attention to it we don't even thank God for the breath of air that we breathe and we don't thank him because we can walk come on we don't think him cause we got two hands and two arms that we can raise and praise him and you know how we are we just take it for granted but wait what tell me what's the bird look like what color I don't know I've heard it all in my life I don't know what it is it's just a bird well somebody please tell me what what's the what's the plumage on the bird well what about this what about that he had been robbed for years for this reason the glory of God needed to be made manifest brother Paul I wonder how many times he was laughed at you know how cruel people can be I wonder how many times he was made fun of he had no way of making a living he was a beggar can you imagine begging every day of your life and yet Jesus says but the works of God should be made manifest in him so Jesus was going to prove that he was God by opening a Blind Man's eyes that had been blind from his birth so he was robbed that God might have Glory I wonder how many of us are willing to be robbed of this or that or the other now don't get caught on me already now if God needed someone in this day that could be healed of some terrible terrible disease or sickness but he must prove it by this specialist and that one and another and a scan and an MRI and a CT and this one and that one and a doctor here and the doctor there and a doctor over there and another doctor over there and then when God does it records from from one state to another how many of us would be willing to say Lord I will four of us five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve takes us a while to think about it on to process it and say now Lord I don't want to commit to this if I can't do it you see how the glory of God Is So intertwined with our life and yet sometimes the glory of God cost the recipient of those works such a price I find this amazing because the disciples the preachers they didn't look at this man as an object of Mercy but rather a subject of a discussion about theology so they never even looked at the guy and said poor guy is there anything we can do for it Jesus have mercy on him oh God please be mindful they don't even look at him but that way at all but they look at his situation and they go to discussing the theology of how did this man get this way may God help us to never be so cold and so indifferent oh don't you want to be touched don't you want to be touched by people's failures and their weaknesses and their frailties and their infirmities so the disciples look at him and you know imagine how it must have broken the very heart of the Lord Jesus so what we see in this that Jesus is showing a greater view of suffering which had not up to this time been viewed correctly we remember job of course and different ones in the Bible in the Old Testament and they went through a suffering but yet it was still not brought us clear as it would be in the New Testament so Jesus brings out a view in the New Testament and then Paul picks it up Peter picks it up Paul writes about it in Hebrews chapter 12 if you'd like to read that with me verse 6 and he says for whom the Lord love us he chastened us which means to train children to be instructed talk or learn to chase sin by Affliction of evils and calamities while anybody in line behind me for this oh wait a minute maybe I should be behind you listen now what the what the chastise with blows to scourge of a father punishing his son for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth not only life about it sometimes about going to church well what do you expecting to church today a woman I'm going to church to get beat up I'm going to get the hot tore off of me and I know we life about it but I'll tell you one thing you ought to be one of the happiest human beings on the earth if God corrects you that means your sons and daughters that means he loves you you ought to be so grateful he won't let you do wrong I never even make you feel bad about it there are people that claim to be Christians there are men that claim to be preachers and they can cause one of the biggest messes ever was in the ranks of a message or in a local church or whatever and never feel one bad feeling from God at all they will tear up this and that and the other and spew out their false Doctrine or whatever it is and will cause all kinds of situations and never feel terrible at all oh my goodness I'm so glad that my Holy Ghost if I think the wrong thing if I don't even have to say the wrong thing if I say the wrong thing if I get the wrong attitude praise the Lord Brother JD told you about an attitude I had one time hey I'm so glad that when I do that my father won't let me go on and say well it's okay it's fine it don't matter it does matter to our God and that not only matters to God but it matters to his children notice to whom the Lord loved us he said he's chasing us and Scourge us every son that he receive us so every son that comes to God will be chastened and he will be discouraged and chastised notice in verse 7 if ye endure chastening now notice the further stage of chastening so God could spank you or correct you and then you get an attitude and you still don't go on to placing but verse 7 brings the volume of it together if ye endure which means take patiently to remain not to recede or flee to preserve under misfortunes and trials to hold fast to one's face in Christ they are bravely and calmly ill treatments bear bravely I mean needs help this morning by bravely and calmly ill treatments if he endure chastening God deals with you deals with you house with sons for what sign is he whom the father chasten us not now the disciples are going to get of you into the history and the sadness of this man's life and yet the glory of God is going to be expressed in him in a way that was not expressing any other character in the entirety of the New Testament we don't have time to get into it this morning but I'd like to take this man right here and show you the mystery of redemption lays right in the very life of this man even the very word that Jesus chose to use to send him to a certain pool signified the mission of the Lord Jesus to the Earth but watch this man the disciples wandering now and the Lord Jesus totally blows our theology out of the water and he said neither one of them but this man was born blind that the works of God might be made manifest in his life so the disciples are going to see it now the man himself is going to receive two aspects of Illumination he's going to receive sight in his eyes but he's also going to receive sight in his soul praise God for this man was the very one that stood up before the scribes and the Pharisees and said for they know that God here is not Sinners but if any man be a worshiper of him and do us his will him he hear us whether this man be a sinner or no I don't know but this one thing I do know where I was blind now I see the prophet said this guy had some pretty good theology on himself now so this man is fixing to experience the glory of God but look at the price look at those years he would never regain them brother Rob all the years as a young man we don't know if he was married or not scripture says nothing about a wife or nothing about children the only thing it mentions as far as family is his father and mother now you said why didn't his mom and daddy let me stay at home why in the world when they come right down to it whenever they said they'd asked to ask the mother and father said what about this guy I'll tell you what he's old enough ask him they wouldn't even stand with their son after he had been miraculously healed by the power of God and yet the Lord Jesus said this man was saved for this purpose this man was reserved for this purpose as a matter of fact I knew it would happen and I allowed this to be on him and there was a time I was going to take it off I hope you understand what I'm going to say I want my life to bring glory to God anybody else sometimes that might be by me laying my hands on the set and them recovering other times it might be by me preaching and someone gets saved someone get filled with the Holy Ghost and it might be other times that God would allow me to go through a trial and a test of my faith and I stand there and I will not be shaken I will not be moved and I wait for the day of my Deliverance there might be times that God will let you and I go through something like this man that will be prolonged I pray carefully myself about such things as this and I say God unless you have a reason for this going on longer would you move for me speedily now this is the way we've been praying for Erica for a long time lord unless you have a reason for this going on if there's a reason somehow that you want another doctor to see her another nurse to see her that will have to testify of the glory of God then we want that to happen but if not Lord make a hasty Miracle out of her life look at by the wrong Spencer he told me some time ago one of his doctors told him at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville that whenever he is healed it will be one of the most proven authenticated Miracles that have been in history why because one scan after another one doctor I try another one test after another if God would have healed thy brother the very moment that he found out about it there would not be near as much proof and all sometimes I wonder about his pain his heaviness when I know a person not long ago he vomited eight times before going to church to preach on Sunday morning you think he wouldn't rather be healed you'd think he wouldn't rather have it behind him you think he wouldn't rather be able to stand and not have to have to deal with all that he deals of taking all these pills every day of his life and the doctor sent him a few ever stop it you will not live no time it will overcome you and you will die but what if God has a reason to bring Glory but he has to find an individual that is willing to suffer that God can use them For That Glory I changed my mind I don't want to be first in life let's start back there and we'll make the end of the line right up here on the platform we'll start back there anybody willing I didn't think so but Eddie what is it about us all we want the God is God don't we want God to use you for something but we want this I wouldn't you see it takes a very special person to be able to be tried in this life when you see others being delivered others being healed and changed by the power of God and God touches you in intervals and moves for you something is unmindful but a psyche touches you with this touch and attached to the touch is the words wait for further explanation so he brings strength how many has ever been there whenever you just felt like you were at the end of your rope and you didn't know what to do and you felt like you couldn't make it another day and the spirit of God would touch you and help you and yet not totally deliver you and then somebody else the next service turned into a a praise testimony or I want to thank God I'll tell you what I come to the prayer line and I needed this this and this and God heal me God delivered me and you're thinking God I was right behind them I was right behind them in the line I needed it too Lord I needed it why didn't you hear me but can God trust you for two more months can God trust you for another month what about his sisters can God trust you for another few more weeks can God delay let's set this way he would get this much Glory if he healed you immediately but if he waits and he strengthens and he encourages and he uplifts and he helps you and he helps you and he goes a month two months six months a year and then he goes way Way Beyond all of that and he gets going to further back he gets all that Glory but he'll walk close to you you may not be able to go on picnics with your children you may be even knocked out of service sometimes you may not be able to go shopping the meditation don't feel like even getting out of bed oh can God find some that we'll be willing for such he will and don't worry he's not looking necessarily for volunteers he's looking for the chosen every man under your Testament cannot be this a preacher in the message could not go through what brother Ron's pictures went through I think this morning and I sit and thinking about him of my dear little precious friend brother template God in his wisdom chose to take my little brothers wife that's with him standing back down the other day when my arms around him both of us crying because of sister Karen's passing and I have to be honest I hope and pray to God does he like it I said brother tell me how you doing buddy he said brother Donnie I've just I'm going on I'm going to serve the Lord I'm going to commit to him but he said it's so hard he said men care and we're close thank you and Carol I was down to use Camp I saw Miss sinner going to their house so miss said I thought my goodness I miss seeing her just getting to see her a few times a year I cannot imagine what they're doing myself if Mother Tim would have had a choice and a preference and the Lord had said what do you think I'm thinking about taking Karen what do you think I know anyone left to know everybody said no Lord don't please don't take her how will I live Lord but somehow I don't know how somehow God will get Glory do I understand why the Lord wanted to take one of my right hand men brother Jim bath my brother Jim was sick I never ever thought he would pass never I thought no we need him too much no Lord you no you can do I understand why brother Gene Lehman do I understand why I don't on and on I could go but I know this Our Father makes no mistakes but I guarantee in fulfilling the will of God their hearts setting you today that are still dealing and suffering what's the loss ask my son-in-law Scott if he still misses his daddy that's my daughter Alicia she misses she loves Jimmy like a father second father ask my granddaughters I said Courtney sister Lindsay don't need to ask her you know how she feels some of the rest of you that have lost loved ones and you think in a premature time why would God do such somehow he will make it work to his glory you go unservatively brokenhearted yeah one of your greatest treasures taken from you I hear the prophet as he says when God took my wife and my little girl and he said the thing that shook me and I couldn't understand it and he said that then some time later I saw her as a young woman on the curtain of time you remember the story he saw her as a young woman and I saw that wagon and the Broken Wheel and I looked at her and I realized thank you Lord if he would have let her lived she might have turned away from him so he had to take her you can hear him still in 1965. dealing with the loss of that first life and that little baby still dealing with the pain and Satan come to him no doubt year after year well you know what the devil told him standing at the casket he wouldn't even have to look your way he wouldn't have to say a word yeah you've served him and you've done this and that and the other and look at him now now he won't even answer your prayer the prophet said I was about to the place and I said well if that's the way he is but he said thank God there was a typos and I said the Lord give and the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord because I can't say that I fully comprehend what's suffering in time and suffering as a mortal does how that it translates into qualities that are eternal but we know he himself suffered greatly that he might become part of us aren't you glad he did notice Paul says in First Corinthians 4 9 if I think that God has set forth us the apostles last were appointed to death we are made a spectacle unto the world the word spectacle here is a word associated with the Roman Arena so but this time they're already doing the Gladiators and so on in the in the arena and Paul was placing the apostles as they were out in the middle of the arena and The Spectators were on looking notice how broad he makes the audience we are the spectacle to the world to angels and to men so the angels are watching while the apostles are being laughed at ridiculed made fun of the world is looking on and other men are looking on and Paul is trying to understand God why would you make us as the apostles you set us forth last but yet the apostles were the ones who were called first notice how it goes on my in verse 10 for we are fools for Christ's sake but ye are wise in Christ notice the difference between the leadership and the body or how we reverse this around down Through the Ages I'm going to make Idols out of the preachers that show wasn't the way it was in the New Testament Almighty said we are fools for Christ's sake but ye are wise in Christ we are weak but ye are strong ye are honorable but we are despised even unto this present hour we boast hunger and thirst and are naked and buffeted Lord have mercy can you imagine the Apostle Paul being hungry Lord I'd love to be able to bought him some deep wouldn't you him being hungry being thirsty and didn't even have the proper clothes to wear and yet one of the greatest men of God that ever stood on the earth why why God is getting something out of his life which does not come as praise and honor and so on begotten by suffering and yet the apostles names are in the foundation of the city for eternity every time you go in and out the gates of pearl and you look back on those walls that will be the names of The Twelve Apostles in that great City they will have great honor but think of what a price it costs Lord God we are naked buffeted and have no certain Dwelling Place I labor working with our hands being reviled look at the word to reproach rail at revile Heap abuse upon we are reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat look at the Opposites being defamed they make fun of us they laugh at us they call us all kinds of names and we entreat which means Comfort to call to one side to admonish exhort what's being molded in these men character worthy of foundation identification friends do you honestly think a lot of these radio preachers and television preachers in the modern days would be the worthy kind of men to have their names placed in the foundation of the city of God we being the bride we're different from the church we're different from people that are just saved there must be a character from us that must supersede and go beyond the church can I have a few more minutes being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the world off scouring refuse metaphorically the most abject and Despicable men isn't that strange you and I would count it as such an honor to hung around Paul but yet they were made the filth the filth of the world why getting ready for Glory you see we're on a journey to the throne remember Joseph's Journey remember David's Journey remember Esther's Journey to the throne character must be molded from the call and the summons to the crowning a character must be molded in us which will match our Lord heart God as the filth of the world and all the off scouring listen to this word off scouring which is wiped off dirt rubbed off scrapings so the scraps the dirt the grease the filth the off scouring the Athenians in order to avert public calamities yearly through a criminal into the sea as an offering to Poseidon hence the term become used for an expiratory offering or a ransom so Paul is looking at himself and the other brothers in the leadership of the church and said we are the filths and the off scouring we are an ax theater ransom for you as the bride oh my Lord let's read a couple more scriptures if you don't mind second Corinthians chapter one verse 3 blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Mercies and the God of All Comfort who comforters Us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the Comfort we're with we ourselves are comforted of God you ever looked at it in the right way if there's anybody ought to be able to pray for somebody that's got cancer it'll be somebody that's got cancer or experience it and got healed or had a family member why they know a little bit about the pain if there's anybody that ought to be able to have a feeling for a caregiver of someone who's terminally ill it ought to be another caregiver that has to minister to a mother or a father or a child now notice Paul says then who comforteth Us in all of our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble do you understand instead of us feeling sorry for ourselves whenever we go through so much stuff if we'd only read the scripture right we would realize God does not do this to put us all to where we live by ourselves excluded from everybody else the rest of our life but God wants us to connect with others who have been through a similar saying I'm not talking about a psychological therapy session I'm talking about a child of God ministering from their heart to another child of God no wonder the Bible says when job prayed for his friends God turned the Captivity of job why because God wanted him to reach out and realize the finale of his ultimate Victory is not pointing to himself but reaching out to others oh my for as the sufferings of Christ abound in US so our consolation also abound Us by Christ and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which also we suffer for whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation that I may know him and the power of his resurrection listen this is where the nominal Church stops that I may know him in the power of his resurrection the cross the cross the tomb the cross the tomb the cross the tomb the cross how many churches around Tri Cities today and that's as far as they ever appoint their people to I want to point you to the other part of that verse because I believe there's bride sitting here but I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings the fellowship of his sufferings several years ago I was a brother Fred Mullins the sister B down South Carolina I mean Carol and they began to tell us some of the things they went through as a young boy and a young man and young girl and a young woman of how they were treated by sometimes white people and how rough they treated him the names they used and the names and synonyms and things that they were called it absolutely broke my heart as I sat there tears welled up in my eyes as I heard what they had been through but yet in one sense of the word I could not relate because I'd never been called those names if brother Joel Brown would have been sitting there brother Joel is sitting at the same table he would no doubt be able to relate in a way that would be foreign altogether strange to me both of us humans both of us with feelings maybe he and I both sitting there were tears in her eyes but he would have flashbacks of his own things that he's been through for the same cause why because people have a race problem and I'll tell you there ain't no children of God full of the Holy Ghost has got a race problem if you claim to be a Christian you got a race problem you better get to Holy Ghost amen it would touch me and it did it broke my heart but brother Joel would have an affinity that I would not have don't you understand that's the way God was God could hear the anxieties of his people he could hear the trauma he could hear the wise and the wherefore he could hear all of that but he could not relate until one day he came down and sat down around the table himself and said now I know how John's going to feel now I know how Mark's gonna feel now I know how this man this woman now Brothers I know how you're going to feel when the prophet of God said he himself suffered sexual temptation listen if those words suffered suffered sexual Temptation you know as well as I do if you've ever had any bad Temptation there's some Temptation well it bothers you but there's others they actually cause you to suffer and the Lord Jesus allowed himself to suffer he allowed himself not only to get sick but to be tempted in such a degree that it caused him anxiety and stress and suffered second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 6 whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation notice Philippians 3 10 that I may know him and the power of His Resurrection The Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death second Corinthians 4 8 we are troubled on every side yet not distressed let me close with this we are perplexed but not in despair I love this this is one of my favorite scriptures not forsaken you see no matter what you're going through if you look at it the right way there's a positive that always goes with your negative but if we're not careful we will focus only on the negative so let's focus on the negatives in this verse persecuted cast down always bang about in the body beat whipped made fun of suffered stripes now if that's all we want to focus on we can or we can focus on the rest of the truth persecuted but not forsaken glory to God how many can say Amen to that stand to your feet if you have been persecuted but not forsaken by the grace of God how many of you can say by the grace of God I've been cast down but not destroyed Oh Glory how many has been run down run over and everything else but not give up by the grace of God have you felt like it oh sure those times you felt like it but something down inside of you would not let go well he said glory to God I'll tell you one thing I made up my mind to quit which time yeah I'm glad it ain't determined by us making up our mind he made up his mind before I had a mind always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for which we live and are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in US but life in you verse 15. for all sayings are for your sakes that the abundant grace matter the Thanksgiving Amendment down to the glory of God for which court call us we thank not but though our outward men perish get the inward man is renewed day by day now listen at all these things that I have described and listens the way that he puts it up in verse 17 for our light affliction which is but for a moment all of that hey I ain't even finished with it I'll wait till we get to more of it there's more yet to come and he called that a light Affliction it's a man in time looking to Eternity and comparing what eternity is going to give to what he went through in time and he said it ain't even nothing it's like it is it's but for a moment oh it'll pass away so fast [Applause] praise God asparagus Lord Jesus thank you Lord God father we love you today Lord I'm sure that under the sound of my voice in the visible audience and invisible as well Lord many have been through so many things Lord I'm not talking about self-inflicted or things that we've caused and brought upon ourself but since being your children oh Lord God we have to be honest with you Lord we don't always understand why you do what you do but we have to trust you and know your ways are absolutely perfect oh man what a contrast between the service last Sunday morning live Sunday morning when we saw Esther going up to her position to be crowned my we all rejoiced it praise God now this Sunday morning we're brought back down to the journey to get from the summons to the crown we endure a little bit more about the suffering and the the problems that we in face are that sometimes engulf Our Lives Lord and we have to be honest with you we don't always know how you're going to move or when you're going to move we just believe you will in your time I don't think there's any of us here today Lord that would want to walk down streets of gold I don't think there's any of us here today that would want to walk into the paradise of God and have to be babied that you kept every trial and every test away from us but I dare say there's probably just as many that would say Lord I'd rather you didn't take my husband I'd rather you didn't take my wife God don't take one of my children God don't let me have a terminal sickness where I'll be sick for years on end please God I beg you don't and I'm so glad Lord that if we would even think such a thing that you look down on us and you say I understand for you yourself did not want to go to Calvary you did not want to die the prophet said you loved your disciples and you didn't want to leave them y'all had gotten so close and you were the best of friends and you didn't want to have to leave them so you prayed if it be thy will let this cup pass from me Lord Jesus thank you for understanding our Humanity But ultimately what we want is for you to have your way and our lives Lord God Hallelujah how many be willing with me this morning just to raise your hand and say Lord here I am take me use me whatever you want and keep in mind friends before you do that the will of God will never lead you for the grace of God cannot keep you well brother Donnie I'm afraid what if he does this or that well if he does you found confidence and you found favor in his eyes there's only one job in the Old Testament or is only one there's only one blind man like this God knows what you can go through and don't don't ever get under that fear oh God what if God will do this what if God will do that don't live under that fear just live under Trust knowing that if he allows you to go on this track and this path he's using it for a purpose and he'll help you and he'll strengthen you and when you get there that day he will reward you for your pain and use your suffering because you submitted to his will I imagine when we get there that day and brother Tim sees sister Karen sister Linda sees brother Jimmy all these other brothers and sisters oh my goodness they meet their spouses and the Lord Jesus will have a reward for him you didn't understand why I took him you didn't understand why I took her but I had a reason and I saw my greater glory and I saw the greater good but I'm going to add this to your record I saw the tears you cried I saw the lonely nights that you spent I saw the days when you run your hands and you said I'm finished Lord I have nothing else to live for I have no more joy in my life I will reward you today my daughter for your sacrifice I will reward you my son for your sacrifice the Lord oh Jesus We Worship You Lord God take us Sister Clay father God into your hands today moldus shape us make us Lord if you delay help us to endure if you say wait a while I've got one more doctor I want to look at you and then after that it'll be your seventh time around Jericho and you're totally delivered we don't want to Rob Your Glory from you to heal we don't want to Rob Your Glory from this or that Lord God In The Name of Jesus help us in our trials help us in our test father that we can be faithful oh Grant it Lord granted Lord Jesus Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus how many wants to be faithful in trials faithful and test would you just raise your hand to him oh brother I'm afraid he'll put more on me no children you can trust him he's not going to do that he will never put more on you what you're able we can just be honest father we want your grace and we want your mercy we get frightened When Trials come our way you did the Bible says it was heard in that you feared brother Brown told us whenever you sent them there that day and you went with them to jariah's house and whenever you said she is not dead she's only asleep and they left you to scorn and the prophet said it embarrassed you so your face turned red so whenever people say things to us about you and your word you understand how we feel when our face will feel a little bit flushed thank you for doing that for me thank you for doing that for Brother Louie Lord thank you Lord Jesus for being embarrassed being humiliated oh Jesus give us strength give us courage Lord thank you Lord God oh we worship you Lord Jesus we bless your name today Heavenly Father can we just raise our hands in the presence of the king maybe you're in between past six and seven of marching around Jericho maybe you're on day one I don't know where you are but God's mindful of you friends he's mindful of you he'll never put more on you but what will give you strength to go through don't think he gets weary once you're coming and lay in your burdens there

here today our parents had a great impact on our lives either negatively or positively May the presence of God be with them Lord and help them what an awesome responsibility we as parents have an A all of us have made mistakes and for those mistakes we're very sorry but I pray that you would help them Lord that in the light of the evening time they can be able to raise their little son in a way that's pleasing to you which bring his little life to you today Father and dedicate him for a life of service in the name of the Lord Jesus amen you want to preach well you're starting early [Applause] some people get in front of a microphone they just can't take it can let's Stand Together return to the book of Isaiah chapter 54 also while you're turning there I'd like to wish two more special people a happy birthday today that is Ashley and Courtney our oldest granddaughters we love them so much and so thankful to the Lord for them and I'd like to wish Carol a happy 51st wedding anniversary tomorrow and then a happy birthday on Tuesday God bless her between her and my guardian angel I won't even get no reward when I get there I'm all the time getting into precarious and difficult situations and I was in one yesterday and Carol and I was talking about it after the situation and I said when it's all said done whenever I stand before the Lord my guardian angel will get every Speck of reward should been in my name she said yeah right now he's probably saying thank you Jesus thank you Jesus amen certainly appreciate my wonderful beloved wife she's been such a help to me through the years I apologize to her quite frequently not because I've committed adultery on her or anything like that but because of being a preacher all the burden that I brought upon her life and I tell her all the time she could have found men that were definitely a whole lot more handsome don't you'all say Amen to that men that could have probably provided a whole lot better for her but I guarantee you one thing she could have never found another one that would love her any more than I do and I'm so grateful to God for I believe this is our shortest time together we're going to be reunited again on that other side praise the Lord I won't tell you how old she is but she's a same age I am I can tell you how old I'll be 68 wow me and brother JD was telling that before service you just there's no way I have believed I'd ever Liv to be 68 years old there's no way I to believe the Lord would have delayed his coming for this period of years but I know this as long as I've got life and breath I'm going to do everything I can for him and for his people I trust youall feel the same way today God bless you let's read Isaiah 544 fear not for Thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for Thou shalt not be put to shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of thy Youth and shall not remember the reproach of thy widowhood anymore for thy maker is thine husband the Lord of hosts is his name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole Earth shall he be called and remember in reality he's not called that yet this is a prophecy that Isaiah gave of him that he will be called the god of the whole earth that's what we're longing for isn't it for the Lord has called thee as a woman forsaken grieved in spirit and wife of Youth grieved in spirit and a wife of use when thou was refused sayest thy God and he has a need today that you'd like to signify by the uplifting of your hand we'll take it before the Lord Lord Jesus as we stand before your people today I realize it's the greatest honor that a more could have what a great honor it would be to be able to address a king of a country even though we might differ with our president and his politics yet it would be an honor for us to be invited to go before him and talk with him it would be an honor for us to be invited and receive a personal invitation from the governor of Tennessee or some great person and yet Lord God we have an invitation from you and if a president wasn't there and the governor wasn't there to be able to speak to his wife what an honor that would be well sir until I get to see you that day I will continue this honor that's been extended to me for since a young boy you gave me the honor to preach your word to win souls to your kingdom to see people filled with the Holy Ghost to preach to them the evening light I consider it the highest honor of my entire life so once again we've gathered here today Lord and the lot has fallen upon me that I would be given a charge to try to bring something to your people to help them only you know what they all go through all that they face so I'm not here to tickle their ear as it was I'm not here to rebuke them as far as the human part I'm here to say something that would help them if that means correction if that means over an abundance of love and administration from your sovereignty then so be it you see our needs speak to us today Father we love you with all of our hearts in Jesus name amen you may be seated Isaiah is at the Prelude before God is going to divorce Israel by the time Jeremiah begins to prophesy he says where is the writing of thy mother's divorcement so Isaiah is there and there's still a period of Grace to where God is dealing with Israel and offering them that chance by which they can respond to his Grace Grace as we know is unmar favor something that we don't deserve something we could never do to buy it to purchase it any works we could ever do that God would say okay because you done this I'll give you this which is exactly where they were God Likens them to a young woman who had gotten married into a marriage of Shame a marriage of humiliation a marriage that had brought great bondage to her and God stepped in and his mercy and had redeemed her and by now she is already turning her back on him she has worshiped the gods of Moab Kos she has worshiped the gods of the ammonites the amorites the Hittites they brought their children before the idols and they would make these Idols out of bronze and they would leave them Hollow in the middle 9 to 10 foot tall big gigantic arms and they would build a fire inside of this Idol and whenever it got so hot that it would burn your flesh they would bring their children alive and lay them in the arms of that God because they believed it was a god or goddess of fertility so in order for them to have good crops good Vines good trees and their families to be able to bring forth they must sacrifice so they sacrific their children you imagine bringing your child your son your daughter and you're laying it in the arms of this image that the priest would have to hurriedly lay the child on there to keep from getting a burn on their own flesh because these Idols were so hot you say that's a bunch of heathens I'm not sure it's too much more Heathen than what a lot of our parents sacrifice their children to today amen they sacrifice it to rock and roll idols and all types of other Idols come on now don't get quiet on me already they they sacrifice their children to a lot of things that sacrificing has not stopped but I think we as Believers need to realize God has given to us an opportunity not to sacrifice our children to the idolatry of this age you parents say Amen to that because we know that God gives us the challenge but he also gives us the opportunity and the responsibility to bring up our children in the way which is pleasing to the Lord but Israel by this time now it's 700 years or so BC whenever this is written seven he has quite a span there over which he prophesies in Isaiah 7:14 is course 712 Years BC so this is sometime after that so around 700 years or 695 something like that BC and they already gotten worse by the time that God had given ahaz his sign in the Sund dial I'll let you read that historically so you can understand it in Isaiah chapter 7 so they went on a few more years and during that time they've got worse and worse and worse and God would always send the ministry of prophets deeding with Israel in the Old Testament now use judges of course in the dispensation when every man did write that which was right in his own eyes this is before God instituted the office of prophets and began with Samuel once God does and the people desire Kings not God's choice but the People's Choice and when you look at the first choice of King that God gives him and it was a man by the name of Saul a man that was rebellious stubborn hardheaded and you look at the leaders that are leading the nations of the world and you'll catch a pretty good glimpse of the people they are leading is it any Wonder we have such leadership in our nation today it is a reflection of the choice of the majority of the nation so what you see in the White House what you see in the Senate what you see in Congress what you see in the mayor's offices what you see seeing a lot of this and you say boy that's a sorry bunch of politicians but remember we are a democracy we vote them in well come on somebody so what is it these rotten people that we see running our country running our state running our positions of authority who is it that put them in there it is an element of the majority of the people why it suits their taste so their taste for a modern-day leader is a man that will do away with all sense of morality all sense of morality because they don't even know if they're women or men and they don't want people in there that can Divine and say there's only two Sexes they want people that'll say oh there's a whole bunch I mean today you can be a giraffe Kamar you can be a donkey I'm not too far from admitting that a donkey's got more sense than a lot of of our leaders do that's pretty evident I I think a lot of monkeys climbed up in a tree has got a whole lot more sense than the nation's leaders around the world Amen brother dnie at least a monkey but know he's a monkey well come on somebody you don't find no dog acting like he's a cat do you you find a rooster acting like he's a hen come on somebody you find a hen acting like she's a rooster no she got enough sense to know God made her in H shall always be a hen the rooster's got enough sense to know you don't find no rooster pulling his tail feathers out and taking the comb off and acting like he's some kind of dainty fied Little Hen and he's strutting around the hen house you don't find no transgender chickens well come on somebody you ever see a Brahma Bull out in the field and he takes his horns off and he tries to get rid of that pump on his back and he tries to you know act like a little woman as he's coming through them kind that Waits on us at the resturant what can I do for you what can I do for you today and you think bring me a bucket so I can barf oh you talking about making you sick to your stomach brother Donnie we need to love them I love their soul but I hate that homosexual devil that's on them well that's right praise the Lord and you see that's exactly where Israel had got to the spot and God reminded them of what he had done for them yet it had already arrived to the place of course God knew what they were going to do and by now God reminds them again of the state that he found them in I'd like to run a parallel for you and I today that the Lord found us in the same state so he passed by and Ezekiel talks about it many of you you aware of the scripture that it can be read many times and I've seen it myself and people are bleeding and if they have a profuse nose bleed or the a wound that will not stop and it's the the scripture in Ezekiel when he said I passed by thee and I saw thee and thy blood I've seen it over and over again that if people are bleeding and you read that scripture it's amazing that it'll stop and God reminded them of whenever he found them and they were they were not salted and reminds them of their birth and how he said that you were born and their birth was coming out of Egypt and he said you were not salted neither were you Supple now this was an ancient custom when a child was born they would dry the child off and then they would sprinkle salt on the child and rub the afterbirth and all that off of it and God said that you grew up as a young girl and and you were immature and your hair begin to grow and You Begin become a woman and God said when you did what you come to that marriageable age then what happened to you you started flirting with the world and giving the world yourself and the Bible can be quite plain and how it describes such things and God goes on to say that you sat by the wayside and you opened up your legs to every man that would come by now remember this is the way that Israel treated God and God finally got to the place to where he said no more are you my wife now by the time Malachi comes on the earth and he prophesies and he says that God is going to Smite the Earth with a curse unless he sins an Elijah anointing now remember God has different dispensational anointings that he used in different days when God got ready to destroy and bring an end to deluvian destruction upon the Earth there was a special Angel which had power over the waters but remember remember the waters it wasn't just that the waters come down out of the sky but the Bible tells us The Fountains of the deep broke open now we know that there's great they found them many many years ago there's great great containing elements that are in the earth that holds billions and billions of gallons of water and it's the water table as we call it and whenever the spirit of God begin to move upon the Earth and the rain started coming down this way The Fountains of the deep the water table be to open up and gush out of the very heart of the earth now remember God put it there around the core so that it would keep the Earth from exploding because the Earth's Soul come from the Sun so there was a clinker that shot off the Sun and from there come the Earth what is the very core of the Earth and the scientists are saying now that the core of course of the Earth turns in the opposite direction by that it creates a revolutionary something and how it spins so they're saying now that in the last few years that the core of the Earth has actually slowed down and they're really concerned because of what's going on on the earth and I read that and I think yeah it's like the the inhabitants of the earth that their soul also is of a different nature it's going in a different direction and you imagine if it was not for all this water there in the very heart of the earth which goes around the so or the core of the Earth how hot this place would be and The Fountains of the deep begin to break up and there was great gushers that come out of the earth so the rain was coming this way 40 days and 40 nights and as it was coming this way The Fountains of the deep so what was it that which was an invisible force began to pour out in the and deluvian destruction I want you to keep in mind now Demons of hell are pouring in every direction also the prince of the power of the air now remember what Satan is him and his demons his Legions of evil spirits have access to the sphere above us also the sphere beneath us and the prophet said there was three Realms this way and three Realms this way and you and I are caught in the middle every day we're under the influence of those Realms that's why we can have good thoughts bad thoughts that's why we can have good things to happen to us and bad things to happen to us because we're caught right in the middle of these three spheres the anian destruction would never have happened on the scale that it did had not this power had broke up The Fountains of the deep what kept it there well if you go back to Genesis 1 and you read how that in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the waters and God said let there be light and we go on and on and on one day of creation which seeks 1,000 years and he he come to a spot then the Bible says the Waters of the heavens were gathered in one place called a firmament now firmament is a gathering together of a mass of bodies that are of a similar genos of a similar kind so there was a firmament in the heaven and then there was a firmament on the earth so there was Waters that was gathered in the heaven what was that water it was what we know as water vapor which will make clouds storms and so on but then there was a great Gathering of the waters and they were gathered where they were were gathered beneath the surface not the visible part of lakes rivers and streams but it's these great massive bodies of water that are in the earth the destruction was coming near and we could tell that it was going to be an Annihilation because what was bouting up out of the Earth is going to Aid in the destruction when God will allow demon spirits and God will allow the people on the Earth to become so oh so immoral and so rotten that they begin to take on demonic looks they will begin to take on demonic traits and characteristics they will begin to imerge themselves into that penetration of the evil in an Unseen World it is a sign another Annihilation is coming now remember when all hell breaks loose all Heaven comes down so it's like they're synchronized together so God has sent little revivals down through the age and by little I don't mean that it's not a great move of God but it would be smaller than say a a destruction which is going to come in a major way so Wars also are parallel with the revivals that God would send upon the Earth it must have been a terrible time in that anti deluvian time that the people of the earth started taking on a remarkable likeness like the Nether world which they had never seen and they began to become more evil and the Bible goes on to say that the imagination of man's heart was continually on evil so every day all they thought was evil and rotness and no good mean and and how they could corrupt this and violence and remember one of the signs of the end time according to the Book of Genesis was violence now look at where we are many of our major cities the violence how it has increased in our day praise the Lord you remember it's not been just a year or two ago to when a lot of our politicians were wanting to abolish our police force you say are are are you are you people in your right mind you want to get rid of the very people who will try to protect us and be able you understand that our police force they're having the hardest time all over our nation to even get people that will come and work for the police force because they think it does no good you go out and arrest the criminals and they're out of they're out under a bond or Bond free quicker than it took them to book them and read them The Veranda rights and they've got to go through all that process and these liberal judges and these liberal bunch of politicians and prosecutors and so on come on now don't get quiet on me don't you see what it is hell is vomiting its influence upon the Earth and then you turn around on the other side and you look at what a miracle that God is doing on the Earth by a people who do not feel at home in this world anymore and then we see people who walk away from the light of the day and we watch how they corrupt and how fast they will corrupt and you know it as well as I do for those of you that's had family members that's been raised in the message or maybe even come to our church and they got away from God and it's like within a month's time with two months time and six months time you don't even know them and I find it amazing because as I've looked at people do that over the years and you watch even their physical countenance that they will begin to take on a different look and sin Demands a great price and if you're a seed of God God will haunt you every day until you come back to your place but at the same time those that are not his he is not haunting him them but it is rather the demons out of hell and remember demons are like the angels of God they're almost helpless without human beings to work through so it must have been a terrible time in this and deluvian destruction that the people on the Earth you imagine people that was living now several hundred years old during this time and they would live that lifetime what a change they've seen so as as I said I'll be 68 years old the things that I've seen in my lifetime are unbelievable now we got people here in their 80s some close to their 90s you imagine what they've seen in their lifetime how that the world has gone down further and further is that true for some of you old people some of you young younger people would you thought You' ever see in your lifespan brother Paul some of the things that you have seen brother Maddy what you've seen in your life and look at where we are you think how is it getting worse it's because the lid has been tore off of hell and them demon powers are streaming in every direction oh he said brother Donnie that scares me you have no reason to be scared unless you don't have the Holy Ghost now if you don't have the Holy Ghost you better be scared stiff because I'm telling you you're not going to be able to make it in this day without the holy ghost coming to this church is not enough saying you believe the message is not enough brother Donnie I respect you that's not enough I respect God's Prophet that's not enough you've got to have a power in you that is greater than these demons out of hell that we are dealing with now remember it's never been quite like this before what we are dealing with and God out of this age is going to present to himself the capping of all the church ages and he would choose the very worst age of all to bring the Capstone he would wait until the very last moments of time until man had got to such a place that he was beyond Redemption our nation is beyond Redemption I don't care who gets in the White House in November I don't care who wins the election we are Beyond Redemption America turned down her chance in 1956 and she's gone downhill ever since we could have a Abraham Lincoln we could have whoever you think was a great politician in every state and it is beyond Redemption let me go ahead and say it the majority of the churches are the same way and God is not calling this denomination that denomination this church that church but God is calling individuals God is calling men women boys and girls who are willing to come under the influence of Heaven itself in order to do this there must be the releasing of a supernatural anointing which will bring the bride to a place of climax Luther did not need it listen to me carefully now Paul in his age now if you'll follow the timeline of the way when Paul gets converted and he starts preaching and Paul would write some of his first letters in Luke of course the author of the book of Acts and he would begin to write some of it and begin to write down some of the sermons that Paul preached and you can here Paul as he starts out that Paul actually believed and thought that the coming of the Lord Jesus would be in his generation but as the time went on you hear Paul and the Revelation began to become more clear to him that he recognized the coming of the Lord was not going to happen in his lifetime and you watch the volumes of these writings how the Holy Spirit began to change how wanted to anoint the people for the present time you see this is what God wants us to be God wants us to be charged for the present but changed for the future charged for the present but changed for the future God don't want us sitting around twiddling our th waiting waiting waiting well the last five minutes before the Rapture I'm going to get on fire with God you'll be of no benefit the years that you're here while you're waiting for that if you have that attitude but God wants us to be charged stay charged full charged praise the Lord uh you brothers that operate battery operated tools or a blower or whatever it is ain't it so aggravating whenever you get ready to blow your yard or this and that and the other whatever you're going to do you you just need to cut one board one one by6 board and you grab your favorite battery powered saw and you pick it up and you pull the trigger and it's As Dead As a hammer well that's the way it is sometimes with Christians they're a DeWalt Christian they're a Makita Christian RI Christian they look like it they're the right color they've got the brand name and you go to pick them up for something you push the button and they just sat there they don't move they don't turn they don't wiggle they don't squirm they don't do nothing but what God wants is fully charged Christians so it's the Lord needs you today this evening tomorrow tomorrow afternoon if the Lord picks you up that he can put his finger on your trigger and you're ready to deliver whatever God wants so he wants us charg for the present but change for the future so that we stay fully charged while we're going toward our great Heavenly home but at the same time we are planning for it living for it I'm going to make plans as if though I'm going to live to be 75 or 80 years old or 90 or whatever but I am going to live every moment of my life as if though it were my last moment cuz it might be is that right now when God goes to dealing with this then you can watch them as they parallel and it's like when Moses begin to write in Genesis 1 and then he put a a span of time a space of time in between the time that the Earth starts being brought into an existence and we can read in Jeremiah as well whenever he looked at the Earth by vision and he saw the Earth that it was in this dark and chaos God would have never made the Earth and left it like that and God would have never left it in such a state of chaos but it's like something happened to the Earth the Primeval State as it's called the Primeval state of the earth and by the time God anoints Moses to be able to write it's like something had already happened catastrophic and it had brought the Earth in this state and it looked like an absolute total chaos and then God begins to move again remember the prophet said when God said you know these seeds let these seeds come and those seeds come even said about let there be light he said the sun and the moon and the stars were already in existence he was not creating them originally they had already been created but remember as God did to the Earth the Earth was your mother so the Earth was the type of you so the Earth was signifying the way you would be brought whenever you were given birth in this life you would be brought out of that dismal dark stage of sin and Chaos that you were in and yet there's something in every human being with a soul they're searching for something they're looking for something they may wound up believing taism they may wind up believing shintu ISM they may wind up being an all types of different religion they may believe in reincarnation they might be a Hindu they might even be a church member whatever denomination that it will be because there's something in them that hungers but God desires to do to us the same thing that he did to the Earth so when he catches Moses up and it's like Moses breaks in on a stage of the creation of God after a great catastrophe or something has happened the pre-adamite world and when something the Earth was in that state and then God allows him to go back and the spirit of God begins to move and he begins to divide the firmament and place the waters here and place the waters beneath the Earth and he gathers the waters now you see this is what God does and God divided the light from the darkness now before it was all this mass of Darkness covered the Earth but what was light the light was gathering the light into a dispensation and separating the dispensation of Darkness from the dispensation of light and the evening and the morning were the first day and then we go to the second day and you found the same thing right on down the evening and the morning I want you to notice the way the Bible writes this that it does not say say and the morning and the evening were the first day but the evening and the morning now if you know the Jewish calendar and the way they keep their time you know that the way they look at it that the new day actually will begin later on in the evening so in the evening that's why the Bible says it and the evening and the morning were the first day so in Sundown Shabbat would begin on Friday afternoon so late Friday afternoon when the Sun goes down that is the evening so the evening signifies the birth of a new day now as westerners the way we look at it we look at the sun coming up in the morning and we say well that's the start of the new day no that's not exactly the start of the new day actually that it starts at that way we look at it westerners it's 12:01 a.m. so you got midnight which is p.m. right and then whenever the clock goes past that till it comes to 12:01 what is it it's a brand new day and yet it is total darkness on the outside so the new day can begin though it looks like it's still a darkened chaos I hope God helps me today to help you to see we have already moved into a new day amen now there's Darkness all around us everywhere there's sin there's debauchery filthiness absolutely unbelievable time that we're living in but we've already moved into 12:01 a.m. so the way we are looking at it it's simply the last stages of the darkness before the sun comes up now what are we looking for we're looking for the Millennium what will the sunrise be the sunrise will be the dawn of the Millennium when the son of David will come and Rain upon the earth now remember God chose three dispensations under the title son son of God Son of Man son of David now Jesus himself identified himself and he referred to himself both ways of course Son of God and son of man so what is Son of God the great spirit God remember God is not a man but God is a spirit so the spirit God gave birth to the part of himself which could become manifested or visible now in that realm the invisible God could never be seen by any of us none of us as a matter of fact God's Prophet said God has never been seen and never will so what will we behold even on the throne of the Millennium what will we behold in the Eighth Day When Jesus our Joseph was set on the throne and then the father will be that light that great shik of Glory around him remember God is not a man God is a spirit so God has to step out of that glory to take on a manifestation to where we able to even know it so then when we look at the destruction God anointed a man by the name of Noah and gave him a message to tell him something is fixing to happen and Noah responded to that message now I realize people saying well what difference does it make if you preach this that the other it don't make no difference oh but it does so what if Noah would have preached Moses message and Noah would have said tell you what we're all going to come out of the land of Egypt and we're going to go up here somewhere in Assyria and we're going to go up a high mountain up there and we're all just going to come out of the land of Egypt and that that that's exactly what we're going to do Noah would have perished with the rest of the earth so with the animals so dispensation it's so important to find the message for the time you're living you understand that's where a lot of the conflict is coming right now and has been for several years around the message dispensation trying to identify what should we be focusing on right now in 2024 what should the message preachers be preaching now let me just tell you this I'm sure you know it already but every preacher is not a man of God come on no more than every Christian is a saint there are many Christians that are not Saints some of the people you work with that you say are good people they may be Christians and saved but it don't mean they're saints Saints come from the Greek word Sanctified and you can have a look at at them they certainly ain't Sanctified so a person could be a Christian and not be Sanctified so a preacher can be a preacher but it doesn't mean he's a man of God he wants to preach he studies to preach and he thinks he's a preach you know some some men are just good salesman and then they confuse it and think they're called to be a preacher they could talk the leg off of his Jack Rabbit they could sell an Eskimo a whole rower of refrigerators and deep freezers why because they've got The Gift of Gab they think it's the gift of the Holy Ghost to call them the preach come on somebody and yet there's many many preachers we of course look at the denomination ranks out here many of them that are not God call men they are preachers but they're not men of God I'm convinced myself in the ranks of the message that there's many in our own ranks that are preachers but they're not necessarily men of God so they will build a kingdom look at their Doctrine Prophet said a man says he's called to be a teacher watch how he interprets the word so if he interprets a word that there's three Gods you know right there God never called that man he's not a man of God God he might be a preacher but he's not a man of God a man of God is those now listen to me a preacher doesn't necessarily have to be a man of God but a man of God will have to be a preacher you see when God calls a man of God he is a man of God before he ever becomes a preacher in that sense he's gifted there God's given to him whenever he was born and yet he will bring forth and capture the light of the day now if he's a messenger of the age God will give it to him and then out from under him will go the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught and then they will go out and when they get out on their own and they'll have their Evangelistic Ministry their Mission Ministry their pastorial Ministry or whatever they are they will remember how important it is to say only what the messenger is spoken but alas many of them will not then they will get a following and they'll get a agenda and then they'll want a bigger following and a bigger following so they do what do they have to do to compromise to where that it will draw the attention away from the mouthpiece of the age especially if that mouthpiece is gone and then they become the mouthpiece and then everybody's supposed to look at them how many have we had well you see that's not a man of God that's a preacher so we don't want to be I don't want to just be a preacher why better any the rest of you preachers here today any of you preachers you just want to be a preacher don't you want to be a man of God what about you Christians y'all just want to be a Christian or do you want to be a saint oh yeah how many wants to be a saint you see only those according to the Book of Revelation that will walk with him in white because they are worthy we look at it Wednesday night Lord willing they will walk with him in white because they are worthy that's Saints identification Sanctified by his presence Washed by the Regeneration and the water of the word so they are not just saved they're not just Christians but they're Sanctified to him Sanctified him what brother Donnie to be his wife as I've told you before the vows that many of the Jews said some of them still say it this way be thou Sanctified so a man's going to take a wife and they don't will thou take this woman as we westerners do but it's very simple to them and he will say to the woman be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel so what that man is saying is that you will not have any other boyfriends you will not be kissing any other man you will not become the best setting ground for any other man's seed but you will be Sanctified for me and me alone you will be my fellowship alone you see God gave Eve to Adam for what for fellowship and reproduction of his own kind how did the devil mess her up fellowship and reproduction so she started fellowshipping with somebody else that started adding to the word well you know God does know that that you're living in the last age and my if you just stand up there and preach that message in full strength you're going to run people off so I thinking about it before I come to church that's the mentality of some of our preachers in the message is that whenever you go to getting in new people that you stop preaching your sermon so this thought come to me and I just thought it was absolutely awesome so you parents that have had babies come to your family and say you've got a mama and a daddy and you've got a 13-year-old boy 13-y old girl whichever it is and then all of the sudden you have a baby this morning into your family I was wondering how many of you parents then because your baby started sucking a bottle and drinking milk only I was wondering how many of your parents changed the diet of the whole family to match the baby it amen don't you see Satan one of his greatest tricks is to try to start sending supposed interested people into a mature light of the word and then the preacher will start pulling back pulling back pulling back oh I'm just preaching for the babies I'm preaching for the new ones now you apply that same practice right when you get a newborn in your house and then when you all went to the table you've got a new baby in the house so brother Rob and sister way Sister Sarah done you that after your firstborn son come along and then your daughter start coming along and then whenever they was on a bottle brother rob you also had a bottle right and Sister Sarah had a bottle and then the children were used to eating mac and cheese and you know whatever they enjoyed eating so you Chang the diet of the whole family because you've got a newborn well why do preachers do it why do preachers when they see a new face attack two and say oh I've got to cut back I I I can't mention nothing about brother brand you know don't you know I I I I know of preachers that have told people preachers coming to their church now don't don't read no quotes and and don't mention the name of the Prophet you know don't don't don't do that that's a man that's not supposed to be in leadership on because he's treating everybody in the church as if they are a newborn we've got some saints setting here that have been eating mature food for decades then what kind of knead would I be to put everybody on a bottle because we have visitors coming in don't you know what Satan would do he would put visitors here every service if I start complying to that rule but there's one rule I comply to it's the rule of God and the Lord Jesus told Peter don't just feed the Lambs but feed the sheep well come on somebody but you see in order to find the identification of where we are and the emphasis that we put on in the time that we're in so here we are there's two great mergings together in the Earth the prince of the power of darkness and his demons has been released in the political world what we see in amas looks like Hezbollah is fixing to start a war from the north already hundreds and hundreds of missiles that are hitting Israel every day and remember Hezbollah is estimated to have over 150,000 rockets and missiles Hamas is nothing compared to Hezbollah and what is the world doing they're still boycotting Israel on the 4th of July in Philadelphia in New York and major cities of America these Pro Palestinian groups met they burned our US flag and they flew Palestinian flags and they curs America and these are supposedly American citizens don't you see don't you see it's an exact parallel of what Isaiah was dealing with years and years ago that our nation that was supposedly founded on the principles of God but does our nation want God anymore as a whole of course they don't what do they want whatever the people want let them have it brother renom talked about that whenever he was here in the 60s and he said where is our Patrick hris where are those people that will stand for what we are and yet the politicians they will stand for it until it comes election year and then they have to kind of be careful of what they're saying you're looking at the news just like I am you're looking at it on your phone and on YouTube and whatever more and you're reading it and you're watching how they're Kinder be careful you know do we go lean toward the Democrats do we lean toward the Republicans you know everybody's getting kind of worried about Biden I just find it amazing they just found it out you think about what a bunch of nuts we've got in this public they are they are surprised by this are you kidding me where have you been for the last 13 months or 14 months or 3 years where what what planet have you been vacating on it must been Neptune or Mars or Pluto somewhere that you don't realize where we are don't you see how deceptive the people are we've got a man in the White House poor God I feel sorry for them it's no longer funny it's pitiful and yet what have them people done they protected it and hid it and would have done it again they would have done it again because they care more about their politics than they care about this nation they don't love America come on somebody they don't love God they don't love his word I'm afraid friends if we're not careful the same thing is going to hit the message of the hour that people are going to be at the spot they really don't love the message they really don't love what it stands for they love what it can do for them what can the message do for them let me use the message as a springboard that I can get a among the message people go ahead you thief and you'll stand before God and be judged oh my I I don't want to just see what can the message do for me how can I be benefited by being around the message but I want to say what can I do what can I do to bring the word What About It Word of Life we don't want to just say well what can Word of Life do for me how can they benefit me what can I get out of going there reckon I could be this or be that my it ought to be the desire of your heart to say Lord let me do whatever I can do to help a brother or a sister the sick The Afflicted the sad the lonely the weary Lord help me to do something to minister back to the body of Christ oh my listen this the prophet said Jesus was God in flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight it's still God manifest himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church don't let that stagger you the son of man revealing himself in his body body before the Rapture is a Prelude to the son of predition revealing himself in his body in the tribulation period Do you believe the son of predition will be revealed who will it be Satan himself in a human being where did he get that idea he's not the originator of it he's copying god notice let me read it again as still God manifests himself on the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known you get it see God down here at his church making his word the word again the son of man being revealed in the last days isn't this in the UN of God but remember the same life that was in the stalk as in the grain it's just maturing right back he revealed himself what the son of man the grain that went into the ground and his ministry comes from them reformations every man of God is a participant of the ministry of Jesus Christ himself not ever preacher now every man of God you see those who make fun and life and ridicu as a lot of the message so-called believers do they are not making fun of the ministry of Daryl Ward or David Siler or Tim pu or Donnie Reagan or you know some of these brothers here at our church they're actually ridiculing the continuing Ministry of the Lord Jesus himself remember Paul gave us the scripture there in Ephesians and he said he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now Paul is taking this from Paul was a Roman citizen and he saw no doubt many of these parades and it would be when one of these great generals would go in and take a country or take a city that they would capture the leaders the families and the Nobles the nobility of that Kingdom and they would parade them through the streets of Rome and this General would get in his Chariot and they would put the mayor or the governor if it was a king they would either put them beside him in the Chariot or they would put him behind in Chains and then here's the Roman citizens and I stood in that that that way that they brought a Carolina several years ago when we made our first trip to Israel Rome and Egypt and they would come through this aan way and there would be thousands times thousands of people aligned as they would come true and the Roman general would have chests chests of gold and silver and momentos of his image and he would reach down when he would get into strong of the people and as he's going through it pull out a handful of coins and throw it to the people he would reach down and get another so here is the Conqueror and the Conqueror is giving gifts unto the people that are there Paul captures this and he say the mighty conquer conquer death hell on the grave and he led captivity captive into down paradise and he gave gift unto men so the Lord Jesus reaches down in his chest of divinity and what did he do he started throwing gifts Apostles prophets evangelists pastors teachers so you see every man of God with a gift from God is a gift to the people in the dispensation that he lives for their benefit for their correction for their leaders ship so that God can bring them back to where they come from so the when the these people they did not fight they was not on on the front with cica they was not on the front with Pompei they was not on the front and risk their own lives they were making bread and you know fixing their children's breakfast and doing this and that but whenever this great gentle had come through and there might be a little woman there and she's just standing there and she just simply reaches up her hand and catches that coin as it comes into her hand she was a recipient of the Conqueror himself so every church that has gifts cuz it's not just one gift every church that has a pastor has evangelist or teachers and missionaries you understand what happened to you the Lord Jesus you were just standing there and the Lord Jesus passed by your way and through a gift of a pastor and a gift of a teacher and a gift of a missionary and You by the grace of God just reached up and said praise the Lord that's mine thank you Lord Jesus why you never earned it you never deserved it you never fought for it your general fought for it amen now if he gave us this gift do you think we need him now watch again as he goes on to say his ministry comes from them reformations back to the original word again his Ministry listen carefully friends don't miss this his ministry comes from them reformations back to the original word again the word comes to a prophet he promised it in Malachi 4 to restore the faith of the people back to the original grain what one in the ground is here the same what went in the ground is here the same the grain has come up through here it comes up as Son of God so what happened on the day of Pentecost not the son of man the Son of God what is God God is a spirit so the spirit gave birth to a son which could be divided the holy Holy Ghost praise the Lord praise the aren't you grateful for the Holy Ghost today what is that Son of God so you receive your portion of the spirit of God in you and yet Paul received it Peter Luke John well wonder why they wasn't going in a rure wasn't time yet so it's not just time alone there's an an anointing a release of something from the presence of God now watch he says oh my it come up as Son of God now it reveals itself here as son of man then it reveals itself as son of David on the throne see them three sons just exactly oh my like the original countdown we've come into a spiritual age of Astron or not see going above now listen I love the way compounds this together makes it so simple it's the same Spirit only more power Same Spirit only more power so here in a little bit I'll be done and then we'll sing and we've got a baptism and then we'll see how the service goes and then you all will be dismissed y'all will go get in your vehicles and maybe you got your place you're going to eat for lunch and you're going to go home when you look at your gas gauge and you look at think wow I'm almost out of gas I got to St and get some fuel well when you do you pull up to the Gas Pump and there's an Amish guy now you know he's an omous but the way he looks way he's dressed now you're on this side of the gas pump and you're seeing the most strange thing you've ever seen in your life because that Amish guy on the other side of the gas pump has that gas pump stuck in the mouth of his horse and that horse is a kicking and a stomping and a raring up and a belching them gas fumes and I mean it's making him sick as a horse no pun intended and you're standing there looking down and you're thinking what in the world well you see that would be like putting automobile fuel in a Luther buggy Oh Glory so what would it be then if we would pull up and you're fixing to fly wherever and and you you see a NASA truck pull up and here's your boing 737 800 Max and and you're sitting man you're looking out the window because you've got the notification from Delta that your baggage is supposed to oh yeah there it is there it is I see it go on oh my so glad so glad and you're getting ready oh my the tourist is coming soon everybody's getting all ready but you see this NASA truck which has Rocket Fuel and it's coming putting rocket fuel in your 737800 max are you going to continue on that flight so you must have appropriate fuel to match your vehicle now you and I both have heard of people once they started condensing the pumps and they put diesel pumps also right by the gas pumps how many people don't nobody please raise your hand have got that green one so what did they have to do they had to start changing the n housle size on the pump filler and also on your vehicle to hope it discourage some so you fill it up with diesel and you go out to there or it may run for a little bit until that gas gets out of your lines and then you have got major problems you see this is where we must be properly aligned as who we are and what our mode of transportation is and we've got to have the right f Fu or we will not leave the Earth so now let's go the other way around so what if we go down to NASA brother Daryl and sister Ward and sister Jessica was down there here just a few days ago and sent me a a picture they was there as they was launching I believe it was a satellite maybe and and they was there as that thing went off you know that great big rocket and went off into the air so what if brother Dar on them would have been standing there and they would have saw this Amish guy and this Amish guy and he's got written on the side you know whatever his name is and he's got corn and brother Daryl and them standing there looking said Cheryl you ain't going to believe this they're putting corn in that rocket they're putting oats they're putting sweet horse food well you don't have to worry about that rocket crashing because it will not get out of off of the ground well you see that's a problem that I have with us trying to feed the bride of Christ Christ Pentecostalism I'm not talking about a real Pentecostal experience that's not the same thing I'm talking about the same mixture of Pentecostalism that I saw when I was a Pentecostal now I can tell you right now it never elevated me very high off the ground now I did shout I did run and I did jump and I walk the backs of the pews you know but I I want to go higher than the backs of the pews what is that 30 some inches maybe I I need to go a little bit higher in this age anybody with me I need to go more than just my emotions been all fired up and you know that I believe in Emotion I need something that will absolutely revolutionize this 68 year old body in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and Lutheranism will not do it Methodist is will not do it Pentecostalism will not do it there's only one thing that'll do it astronaut fuel praise be to God Amen now here comes the old Amish guy and what does he have one horsepower now the old boy don't need 75 of them going down to there he's not the Budweiser deal so he don't need you know them Big C D but he's got one little old horse that's exactly hooked up to the buggy take him and Ma and the 14 young ones up to the store to trade their goods and come back and smile even there oh they hate you people they don't like you you're so worldly ungodly I've never understood that quite since one of their greatest treasures from us English as they call us is our money and the love of money is the root of all evil so they do all their working and sell all their goods so they can get rich on of our off of our filthy lcer well come on somebody I'm glad for electricity it's really hot in here this morning it'd be a lot worse if we didn't have electricity it'd be a lot worse would it I'm grateful for it but you realize if you would look and see that you'd think that is so absurd I don't understand then why people will look at it in the message and think it's acceptable so we supposedly have an end time word and we have an Endtime vehicle to be able to transport us into another world and yet we're putting oats and rye and molasses and throw in a honey bun every now and then who knows it might even put in a Mater or potato or banana and boy we're just making off concoction ever was and we're putting that inside of our soul thinking somehow that the very same thing that just moves their wheels I'm sure that old Amish guy those menites Hutterites whatever they are they're grateful for that horse I'm I'm sure they are but can you imagine if you are would have hooked up your horse this morning to you about as late as some of y'all get to church you still wouldn't be here by the time I get done y'all be showing up whoa Bessie whoa Bessie I'm afraid some of our message folks are still woing Bessie I'll tell you one thing it's time we unhook Bessie and hook up to the son of man oh I wish somebody would hear me this morning it did not Rapture them it will not Rapture brother Donnie don't you believe in healing I believe in healing I believe in miracles I believe in Emotion I believe in shouting but I believe it must be based upon this evening lifetime word oh my we've come into a spiritual age of astronauts see going above it's the same Spirit only more power yes sir so if we could take the oats and run it through a an analysis and we could take the sweet molasses and run it through an analysis and they'd be able to figure out how many BTUs it would release in the body of old Bessie and how much it would help Bessie to be able to pull that cart behind her no doubt it's a real science and no doubt thank God for the Lutheran thank God for the Weston thank God for the Pentecostal but thank God for the astronauts you see in our astronaut tube I our fuel is so explosive we have signs all over our space tube no smoking allowed no drinking allow no running around allow no adultery come on somebody but you see lucer could drink and smoke his pipe and not fear the danger of blowing up that's well Glory now y'all just have to blame this sermon totally on the Lord cuz this is not the way that I planned on going I'm just on page four and I brought about 40 some pages with me this morning so you know what y'all are been entertained by the great Entertainer himself the Lord God Elohim he wanted to bring you and I into a place of special Conservancy to be able to open up his word to us I hope somebody is listening it's the same Spirit only more power Luther had a portion of the spirit of God but he did not have enough power to bring him into a stage of sanctification now how you saying how in the world can a man sit there and drink beer how in the world can a man sit there and smoke and and a pipe and do all that they done and all that sort of thing all in the work of the Methodist and they'd be able to shout around and still make fun of the gifts of the Spirit of God it was the same Spirit but the power was not released to open more of the word so they danced around glory to God oh my lucier come out said come on Best come on best you went lucer glory to God the shall live by faith y'all be on over and by 14 days I'm coming up there Brothers y'all be with yall Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord and then John Wesley Struck it and he said Lord have mercy we got more power than what West have what lucier had what was it it was the same Spirit only the revelation of the word release more power amen is it any Wonder to you that they found atomic energy and Oppenheimer the Jew broke into breaking in as well as Einstein and some of those others of breaking a cell what age not Luther's age not Wesley's age remember they had scientists back then too but in what age the astronaut age Hallelujah more power only lifted higher can go higher see more believe more Glory see more believe more be more like Christ see more believe more be more God's calling us Word of Life to see more to believe more to be more oh my nothing automobile nor the horse and buggy not even the airplane but the astronaut he sweeps on and above each one paragraph 60 he's able to achieve talking about the Lord Jesus now he's able to achieve to himself a bride he's going to in the last days be able to get a bride with a Ministry like a man and wife becomes one when Jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one it fulfills the scripture exactly St John 1412 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also do notice I want you to think of how that brother Bram does not stop with this now at just the prophet again in the countdown now is the astronaut age and the astronaut sees things in either the Horse and Rider automobile airplanes again I know you just read that I know I'm reading it again he goes higher the airplane notice the airplane is still down there bouncing around on the clouds glory to God have you noticed how many in the last six months people people have been injured in severe turbulence in the skies in the last six months people that they've had to rush to the hospital planes dropping 15 to 20,000 ft in a matter of seconds I mean that happens if you're in that cabin and you're not buckled up guess what happens to you that plane drops and you are slammed against the ceiling or you're slammed against the baggage area there where you store your carry-ons don't you see what is done what's going on oh is it a surprise to you that years ago when one of our shuttles was sent up and it got up so high and then there all the world saw it as it caught on fire exploded what did they find out was the problem a seal a Rubber seal that allowed the fuel to enter into a chamber and mix where the combustion was taking place and it should not have done but a seal did not hold how many in our astronaut age have we seen seen many Oh Glory to God I got the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God I got the token and then as they go through trials and they go through tests and they Veer off to the right and they Veer off to the left what's the problem a seal problem they thought they were sealed oh chill didn't hear me this [Music] morning lord god notice he says but he goes beyond the clouds of creeds and denominations and moves on up into the heavens Plum away from everything the astronaut age we living the astronaut age just asur as God has testified by the natural happenings so is he testifying that we've achieved an astronaut God has achieved what he promised to achieve in the last days according to Malachi 4 so in the AST not age God had an astronaut that put his hands behind his head and he started hearing that song I'm lome old so lonesome said would you like to look beyond the curtain of time I think it would help me so much I'm not talking about a near death experience I'm talking about a moving from these four dimensions to the sixth and when he rises up and he looks back and he sees his body he ain't but 20 ft from it and this astronaut landed in the sixth Dimension praise be to God it must have been something John Glenn you know and these guys that went up to the Moon I me what' they find it wasn't cheese what' they find oh they brought some rocks back to Earth and walked around a little bit you know the atmosphere on the earth it on the moon rather it hardly has any atmosphere at all so a footprint that man makes on the moon will lay there for decades because there's nothing there like we have here the winds and all that to change it remember that's you so men have walked all over you men have treated you bad men have done this and that and the other and some of you are still bearing in your memory in your mind in your Spirit the footprints of that preacher or the footprints of this and that and the other come on cuz you are the moon and then God let him had that visitation but he felt funny funny so the astronaut starts feeling funny and he said oh no I don't have to go back said yeah go back and tell him I don't want to go back I don't want to go back Hallelujah some of our astronauts have been caught in the International Space Station and they're not going to be able to return to Earth for a bit because something happened to their vehicle so until they get it fixed they're not going to be able to come back imagine them old boys flying around there doing whatever they do you imagine them looking down third and say I've got a wife down there I got a baby down there and what they want to do they want to come back but notice this astronaut when he went beyond the curtain of time he said oh no I don't have to go back to it do I have to go back Hallelujah so God let him climb back on that astronaut tube as it were and he landed and he got back in his body and then he come to the Tabernacle and start telling them I will never be the same brother brandham that I was let me close God has achieved in this last day according to Malachi 4 the only thing he has to do is get somebody in his hands that can cut loose loose from the airplanes and the Automobiles and what more it'll hold us down every time not look back to what it was but more power to lift him higher lift him into the presence of God lift him up there where all things are possible now we see it's happening let's stand let me read one more stand rest yourself question answer 64 I am not he I am his servant the pillar of fire is not he it's in spirit form see which was upon the son of man and has come now to anoint sons of men to bring back a Ministry just like he said it would be in order for the head notice not a minister but a Ministry I'm the only minister of my Ministry brother brandham was the only minister of his ministry but Jesus has got tens of thousands of ministers in his ministry he he's the only one that could do that so it will bring back now here the pillar of fire you imagine brother random when he meets with the preachers there at the church in the brandom Tabernacle in 1961 and he said Brothers you see what I'm doing I'm putting you all in this with me you all are messengers of the same message now it's really pitiful but hundreds and hundreds of people in this message do not believe that so even when they push play and we hear brother brandom say it they don't believe you you know why they've got a filter put on them so they pull what they hear through them tapes on that man-made filter and then they say of course that brother brandham fulfilled all fivefold of the ministry the only problem is brother Ben didn't say that and the Bible didn't say it so notice this that which was on the son of man has come now to anoint sons of men to bring back a Ministry just exactly like he said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect I don't blame the devil for fighting the god call Ministry in this message cause without them there be no head Body Connection praise the Lord Jesus I said one more can I have your permission to read one more what if 1+ 1 plus 1 equals one reckon that works for quotes too if Jesus cannot come until a church a body of Believers and the ministry will have to be the same as it was then then that breaks them that them without us is not made perfect as Paul said in Hebrews 11 without us they canot not be perfected they they must have this ministry to raise up the Lutheran the Wesley and all them down through their ages don't you understand Paul needed brother brenham's message Luther needed this message Luther needed it he never even knew what it was but he needed you knew is missing something Wesley needs this message Pentecostals needs this message to bring them out from among the dead praise be to God they must have this ministry to raise up the Luther the Wesley and all them down Through the Ages when that come and that part of of where the Eagles gather just as the carcass the Eagles have gathered so it had to be that Ministry that word so when brother brandom leaves the Earth then what what what's God to do well of course many of these selfish men they say I'm the man I'm the one I'm the one I'm going to take his place I'm not a Moses but I'm a Joshua I'm a Caleb you're a liar it's what you are cuz God's Prophet said the last Latter Day message of the last days was the Joshua and the calebs of those who stayed with him praise the Lord so what does God do God himself comes down on the earth himself don't you understand when people fight this message of brother brandham they're not fighting William brandham it's the ministry of Jesus Christ I'll go ahead and quote it for you reincarnated in his church again in the last days and may I not limit it just to preachers I'll go and quote it for you anyway Harvest time you are the reflection of the last day the message of the hour so it's not just preachers but the Lord Jesus in his body what was the book of Acts the Lord Jesus in his body oh excellent Theophilus I supposed it needful to write unto thee the formal things of the Treatise Luke in the book of Acts he wrote to him and mentioned his name in Luke then he mentions it again of the things when brother BR quotes it he says of the things which Jesus started and continues to do you know who it was that healed these people that come through the prayer line the other night wasn't none of these preachers no it was Jesus right you know who it was that brought them backsliders to the Lord through the prayer line the other night it was the Lord Jesus if you understand it right every God called Pastor that stood up today and preach to his church God's prophet said Jesus still speaks through his pastors but don't let it stop with the preachers Let Jesus flow through the ministry of you how brother Donnie loving forgiving praying reaching out of hand doing what you can to minister to the body praise the Lord let's bow our heads oh my Lord Jesus what have you done today what you have allowed us to participate in in this end time we are so grateful father that we have been made to be partakers of this great message in the last days my God that same Pillar of Fire not in its prophetic form but in the other forms and the prophet tells us an invisible Union it's the same Jesus in Bride form the same Jesus in Bride form they didn't see the bride was hid in you when you were here and they didn't see it was you hid in the bride after Pentecost so the whole thing has been hide and seek hide and seek you hid from Moses but he said show me th Glory you hid but he knew this something so he started seeking your Prophet was told by them denomination leaders that thing that he had on him was an evil spirit so he went up there alone to pray when he was down on his face he heard Footprints he opened up his eyes and the first thing he saw was bare feet of a man which was an angel Olive complexion hadir down to his shoulders with his arms crossed I have been sent from the presence of God to explain to you your peculiar births and Ministry but I have been told by my brothers this is an evil spirit this is why I'm here so what was it hadde and seek so he went to seek and you made yourself known years later when he preaches the trial he says to me it was Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 Malachi 4 it brought a fuel to the bride oh hallelujah oh I know it's been misquoted for decades and people are still misquoting it and they say Rapture in faith lays on the tapes that's not what he even said rapturing Faith lays in you and as the word is being preached it comes through that word your Prophet never even made that statement but people hang their Destiny on such a thing and they think by playing brother brandom that they're getting more rapturing faith every time that they hear it and yet deny things that he said about going to church and if God's in your heart you can't wait till them Church doors are open the people in 1964 when they' got saved and he said now look he said you all find you a church to go to seek out some of these pastors because if you don't have a church you will die spiritually amen Lord God we know the sad thing about it is some people go to church and still die spiritually so we don't want to die spiritually either way we want to be alive Lord amen hallelujah hallelujah and we know before them things take off they put that fuel in just right before they're getting ready to leave and we have had a deposit glory to God but we know the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen Hallelujah right before we're fixing to blast off into another dimension the power of God will surge through US Lord and change our bodies thank you Lord Oh Lord May there not be a one of those that sat here today be missing on that day yes Lord father we believe it with all of our hearts help us Lord oh we don't deny the truth of Lucen ISM more than the the truths of Wesley or the truths of Pentecost we just don't want the Creeds that follow it we don't want the ism part Lord that would pull us away from your word we want the power that came with it we want the power of justification the power of sanctification the power of the restoration of gifts mix him with the power of Malachi 4 that'll take us off of this Earth one day in a Rapture oh praise the Lord Jesus we Worship You Lord God thank you Father oh don't you love him today Saints how many he loves him look at me you love him with all your heart don't you appreciate him we're fixing to baptize a little brother he ain't been four years old but he told his mom and daddy they've been been talking to him for a while about being baptized but he told his mom and daddy whenever Brother David preached that service on Sunday that the Lord just dealt with him and it's just time for him to just make everything right with god oh you say brother Donnie it's just a child how can they know what to be baptized I'd say we would be surprised if we knew how young the devil starts aiming at our children I I I couldn't fear our friends before the Lord of a child that keeps you know wanting his mom and daddy to let it be baptized want to be baptized and something happened to that child and me not allow that child to be be baptized but what if they're so young and they need to do it over I've re-baptized a lot of preachers must less Ley oh yeah I baptized a bunch of preachers they didn't want nobody there they just felt they wanted to be baptized it ain't no sin to be Reb baptized this little guy gets 14 or 15 I'm good at it I'll baptize him again if he wants to do it again I'll do it again if he needs to do it again but if the spirit of God is dealing with his heart who can forbid water that's right who can forbid water what if what if one of these days a five or six year old will say mama Jesus was dealing with me and we baptize him nothing great happens all of a sudden mama says to the Daddy what what he he is really changed what if the last seed setting in the church by you and all they've got to do is grow a little bit Carol asked me day she said Donnie how will it be that people that's just coming in all all this stuff that you Brothers have preached for the years won't they have to catch up I said no actually they won't I said a lot of what you've heard and I've heard and all these other people that's been say for decades and decades a lot of that word that we've been hearing and we've heard preach for years and years it's to help us in our everyday journey and brought us from one trial to another to another but God will pick the power points God will pick all the power points brother I'll tell you one thing some of these last ones that come in they'll be nuclear [Applause] fueled wo glory to [Applause] God praise the Lord if I never live to preach you another sermon

he can't take you through [Music] [Applause] so before you think that you're too lost to say remember there is nothing greater than gra what do you say to someone whose life is on the line and they're unsure what happens after their last breath and what do you say to someone who's only known abuse when the walls they buil to save themselves makes it hard to hear the truth and what do you say to a life of regret that's trying so hard to forget and what do you say to dreams unmet there is is no Valley there is no Darkness there is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus there is no moment there is no distance there is no Heart Break he can take you through [Music] so before you think they you're too lost to say remember there is nothing greater than Grace don't lose hope don't let go

take you through so before you think that you're too lost to say yeah before you think they you're too lost to save so before you think that you're too lost to save remember there is nothing greater than [Music] Grace I know you are familiar with the scripture that Zachariah says that the headstone will come crying what would it cry gifts gifts healings healings Miracles prayer lines and we believe in all that don't we what about shouting what about church attendance Grace Grace Grace that's what it's going to be that's going to get us there isn't it I'm just grateful tonight for the grace of God I'm grateful for the grace of God that saved me boy am I grateful for the grace of God that's kept me after I got saved I still need it there every day of my life and I'm sure that you do let's turn tonight to 1 Corinthians chapter 14 if you would 1 Corinthians 14 verse one follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts Desiring spiritual gifts and seeking spiritual gifts is not the same thing so follow after charity and desire spiritually gifts but rather rather that you may prophesy for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto God for no man understandeth him how be it in the spirit he speaketh Mysteries but he that prophesizes speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and Comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesies edifies the church now this is the way we can judge true prophecy if it edifies benefits makes the church grow so if it's called prophecy and it brings confusion if it's called prophecy and it doesn't happen if it's called prophecy and it doesn't tell an individual something or a church something that they need to hear it does not meet the scriptural identification or meaning of Prophecy he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesizes edifieth the church so it doesn't confuse the church doesn't leave the church and tumult nobody's edified by confusion nobody is edified by tumult or things that are swn and Discord that's what we want is it with all of our hearts if every one of us would set our goal and our purpose in life to be able to edify the church edify our families edify the things that God puts in our path you'll find you're not very far away from being a a complete and mature son and daughter of God it's not going to be how much you know up here it's how much you've got down here and how much you can be able to reflect that through from here out to what you know here and express it right here with these hands and your Deeds I me desire that to be that way in your life tonight I me like to be remembered as we pray God bless you I'm sure there's many needs Among Us you know there's a lot of things that are going on of course folks lives but we believe our God is a mighty God he's a Healer he's a miracle worker is that right so let's just take these needs and requests before him tonight father we count it such a great honor to be together once again Lord in this house that's been dedicated to you Lord Jesus we don't know how many more times will we be able to meet here and no doubt father some of us if we realize how close we were to death's door we would sing more sincerely we would clap our hands more sinc sincerely if we realize how few our days would be upon the Earth um I imagine most of us would live every day in a more consecrated way so I really don't know how many more days I've got so I figure the best way for me to do is live every day as if though it were my last I would rather live that way than have regrets at the end of my life and think well I could have done better here and I could have done more there help me Lord that I can live the best that I can every day of my life no doubt I will never get all accomplished that I think needs to be but I've become an old man now and I've realized it's not really important if it's accomplished the way I think it is but what's important is I do what you want me to do so I pray that you'd help each of us tonight father lead us by your spirit direct us through the word tonight Lord we ask in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated what a great privilege it is for us to be part of the body of Christ and to be in our place and uh I understand that brother Tim Bret went a little bit along the lines about everybody was called for a certain place and certain position to be able to be fulfilled we know before the Rapture can actually take place every member of the body of Christ must be in their position now remember there's two parts of this the mystical part and then the church local the mystical part has never hurt anybody the mystical Body of Christ is not the one that you and I have any issues with the mystical part is never the one that you're GI ever getting an argument with because every person that's born into the mystical part every one of them's got the Holy Ghost every one of them is born by the Breath of God so therefore there's nothing in them that clashes but it's those that we go to church with in the local assembly that's the ones that caus US problems that's the ones that we differ with and the ones that we don't like this and we don't like the way they do that and that we don't like something else and a lot of folks you know they think well I'm in the mystical part I'm in Christ so I really don't even need to attend a church but yet we know according to the scripture that the first people that were baptized into the mystical part they went to the Natural part as well because it's part of our assignment that we're given in this life it's part of our heritage actually and our responsibility and we know that the New Testament Church was typified in many different shadows and types and one the one of the wonderful things that I love about it is that God took the Natural Things of life as I was studying about it while I was gone for a few days hunting with some of the brothers and bringing in the work of redemption and how many of the natural things as I got to looking at it in botney life animal life blood type all those different things that God brought in the act of redemption and how many things from the earth that God actually Incorporated to sacrifice Fellowship worship and atonement maybe I could speak to you about it but Paul was the first one to be able to be able to really catch a full understanding the Lord Jesus of course opened it up and mentioned first about it but Paul was the one that God opened up the real understanding in the New Testament about what it was to be a part of the body in so much that Paul was would tell us in the book of Corinthians that the eye could not say to the hand or the hand to the eye or the foot you know well because I'm not the eye I'm not really that important nobody else in the New Testament ever quite dealt with the body of Christ in that way so we know that the body then is likened to the natural human body and then whenever we look at the human body we know there's certain parts of our human body that are absolutely essential for Life there certain things you could do without there's probably people here tonight that no longer have an appendix you maybe no longer have your full thyroid that you were born with or maybe you've only got one kidney maybe you've only got one this and half of that and a quarter of this and something else and there's certain parts of the body that God in his grace knew that people would actually have removed from their body but they'd still be able to live but yet there's other parts of your body that you absolutely abolutely cannnot function without God never gave us two hearts he never gave us two brains he never gave us two parts of certain things that's absolutely essential for us to live and we can look in the mystical body and realize that there might be 10,000 instructors as Paul said yet you have not many fathers so there might be all types of preachers in the body but not every preacher is a father because he don't have the power to beet every preacher is not a starter of the works of God but some preachers only come in after starters start the work of God every preacher is not a starter every preacher is not a finalizer that brings the body to the place of completion now we know that God sends prophets and he chops his people out with His prophets so prophets are the ones that are going to be the major Hing piece in every day and then God will send other aspects of the ministry and they will do the work some will be called to focus a lot on the Divine Healing part in the body others will be called to teach and they will help bring the element of the body into a place of their position to be able to help them see who they are what they are that they need to better themsel in a closer walk with God every man's called for a different spot but yet prophets have a special Insight even in dealing with the body now I love the way that brother brandham deals with this aspect of the body and Christ reveal in his own word which was preached in 8:22 the morning service in 1965 and he said we see down through the age we started all from the foundation through the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed now what went in the ground the complete seed which was in Alpha form God did not seow an impartial seed in the first church age but it was the complete seed when in the ground the complete seed that it come out through the feet in Luther now you got to be careful in types because now where having a human body which also parallels to a pyramid which is another type yet the pyramid does not start with Luther it starts with Paul now when you're running types if you're not careful if you try to run this type over in this type you'll get it all mixed up now watch the bottom of the pyramid did not start with Luther it started with the first church you with me so far but when we're talking about the restoration of the Bride tree it did not start with Paul because Paul under the administration of the anointing of the lion which was the Lamb's own personal life it was not a restored bride it was a whole bride but when you're looking at a restored bride we have a separate type and the analogy is not the same as it was in the pyramid so the pyramid started on the bottom foundation with faith First Church age messenger Paul but when we're looking at a restored bride back to the image and the Perfection of the son of man then it is the image oh she comes into the pyramid truly but when she comes into the image of a man then it does not start with Paul but it starts with Luther in the feet now watch he says it then it come through the feet Luther it come back then through Wesley then into the Pentecostals the tongues now watch what we do we move from Luther the feet and then we move from Luther on up into the stage of wesy which was a great portion of the body which was Whitfield Wesley John many of those men through that era so we come from the foundation part then we come up here then we move into Pentecost and what was Pentecostals type in the body it was the tongues yes the tongues the mouth they knew how to run their mouths but there was also a spiritual part now watch then into the Pentecostals the tongues in the lips now watch we're talking about the image of a man the restored image of the brid tree or you say brother Donnie make up your mind is it a man or is it a woman it's boast it's the restored image of Christ in his bride it will be that that will cause the resurrection now this couldn't happen in Luther Wesley or p Pentecost now watch he said then to bring back through Wesley then in the Pentecostals the tongues in the lips now it's in the eyes now watch now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that CU that's the last thing there is now watch the last move before the body Chang the next is the intelligence the intelligence Now isn't it amazing that here we are by science and one of the great innovations that science has broke into and I you see it everywhere you're dealing with it every day and don't even know it and it's called artificial intelligence or AI now watch man has come to a spot to where in the scientific age that his focus is on intelligence artificial intelligence Israel has been using it for quite some time to help fight this war over in Hamas and Hezbollah by using artificial intelligence they are starting to do surgeries actually starting to diagnose people with diseases and sicknesses with artificial intelligence now the other day before I went on my hunting trip brother Ron Spencer brother Tim and I were texting back and forth and I told him I was going to be gone for a couple of days and brother Ron said send me some photos so this is a text now so I get this text and I pick up my phone to say okay I sure will but before I could actually type out the answer myself I just updated my phone and my phone through AI asked me if I wanted to send Ron Spencer a photo now before I could even pick it up to answer it AI now I did a search today on a few things and you probably done it yourself and the first one that came up was AI generated artificial intelligence brother Larry Elliott sent me one some time ago and he asked artificial intelligence to write a song about William brandham and it was absolutely incredible brother William Smith sent me another one that he done about brother Joel and sister Jennifer Hara on the basis of Esther of the Old Testament except brother will went a little bit farther than brother Larry did and that was that he asked for a program that it would be someone to sing it you should have heard this song it was absolutely incredible so it talked talked about Joe and Jennifer and how they read their Bible and how they pray and all this and that wonderful just beautiful and this beautiful human voice which was created by AI to be able to sing this song then someone else also sent me something that they had generated and it was a consensus of the message Christ The Mystery of God revealed and artificial intelligence went in in a matter of seconds and put out a consensus of the message that brother Brandon preached and of course it was pressage because that's what these people were doing and it was so good I almost brought it to church and preached it to you all I mean I thought wow this is absolutely incredible and yet there's not there's not a human with skin on it but it's actually humans that have brought this together to make it you follow me that's M making this ability to do that now to me there's also a scary side of that so what what could artificial intelligence do if it goes to turning on us human beings but look at where they are so they are at the state that artificial intelligence is going to start helping doctors it's going to start helping perform surgeries and do all sorts of things chap GPT and so many things that you're familiar with and yet it's constantly there even for our children going to school how are their teachers going to be able to know whether they are answering their homework theirself or AI is doing it for them a famous country music singer lost his voice not long ago because he had a a medical condition that affected him and he was told by doctors he would never be able to sing again but yet it was his desire to make at least one more song If possible so these people got together and they begin to talk to him and his wife and his manager and tell him hey you know what through AI we believe there's something we can do so someone wrote this certain song and sent it to him and you know he motioned and wrote he could write down a little bit and tell them that's the one I'd like to do it so they had another country music singer to come and actually laid down a soundtrack and then they fed this artificial intelligence this man's voice that he had sung for years and years and years and then let him get the tempo the Rhythm the intro the musicians all this and that and the other and then through run it all of that through artificial intelligence and when they got done with it here was this country music singer which could no longer sing but he was singing again now if man can do that through machines what if the voice of God had been stifled and held down by organiz ational systems and man-made ideas for hundreds and hundreds of years but the intelligence not artificial but the real intelligence of Christ himself was so step into his body that they in the last days will call for the resurrection amen and it will not be just their voice screaming and hollering or speaking low or mediocre whatever but it will actually be the voice of God himself and where did the prophet tell us in the church AG book the voice of God in the last days would be where it would be in the bride is that right and it it's not we're not looking for some Eighth Day messenger for some other Prophet to rise on the scene and tell us what brother Brenham did not say or pick up more brother Brandon left all we don't believe in any such nonsense at this church is that right but what if God would take that message which has already been preached and make it so real through us that we live that word we talk that word and it brings us to that place of completion and Perfection to where that the intelligence now if we are at that spot right up here now that does not mean whenever the eyes was here there was no more lips or there was no more tongues because those eyes told us there should always be a gift of speaking in tongues in the church is that right so now remember when we're coming up the body it does no longer mean that the body no longer has feet we still have action in the body we have legs we have all of that in the body but we are not going backwards and downwards to make the emphasis of our day the feet we're not making the emphasis of our day the thighs or the upper torso no no we are not nor are we making the emphasis of our day the mouth the tongues come on somebody we that is not our emphasis yes it is part but it is only part as a matter of fact the prophet said speaking in tongues is the least of the gifts well why in the world would we want a major on a minor then but do we need them you answer me do you all believe in speaking in tongues y'all believe in Prophecy come on so they can hear you on the internet y'all believe in the Supernatural you believe in signs wonders Miracles all of that yes but what is going to be the bride's main emphasis it's not just healing it's not just Miracles it's not just speaking in tongues it's all of that it's that plus praise the lord we believe the whole word so we believe in adoption we believe in the Supernatural we believe in the great manifestation of God God knows we need it like never before do we not now notice where the Prophet then places us that we are up now watch he said so the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own it's his we have no s height of our own how can a man foresee those things he can't do it it's God himself see it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through and then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride notice masculine and feminist feminist is the flesh masculinity is the deity of God himself so it's God living in a ride on the earth in the last days which will become his mouthpiece so it's not that she has her own intelligence we're dumb and everybody said go ahead and say it about yourself I'm a dummy say it with me I'm a dummy no you're not saying that I am you're saying that you are I am a dummy we are dummies we without God we don't know anything come on somebody we didn't know how many gods there were we didn't know how to get saved we in the heart had to do nothing right but God by his grace allowed us to find it doubt then God wants to drop the intelligence what would it be a favor believer in our church had this dropping of the portion of intelligence of God in your life I wonder how many of the mistakes and things that we make because of the lack of leadership will disappear before we leave this place why because we are LED of the spirit of God listen to this then the complete body of Christ is reveal in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam did at the beginning like Adams was rather at the beginning so then a after we have arrived now right up here was where we were in Malachi 4 the eyes this is why the prophet could see so there's no other eyes out of these eyes now I don't understand it but you know there's people in the message that have actually got another set of eyes up here and another set up there and another set up here and they've got all kinds of men that they're following and they're looking for this prophet and that Prophet I'll tell you one thing you have got some kind of weird looking body if you ask me you've got about six or six or eight different sets of eyes in that head you are some kind of deform we don't need no another set of eyes but what we need are people under the administration of the eyes to get under the influence of the Divine intelligence then what will it do well if artificial intelligence offered to help me send a picture to brother Ron Spencer and artificial intelligence help me today generate my search on Google and artificial intelligence it's already doing if you you just don't know it so don't be terrified and scared today as you've already been using it Siri and those types of things are very similar so when whatever it's there what's it for to help you well what do you think the intelligence of Christ is going to be in the body it's not to make you and I superheroes it's not to make us Mighty Man and Wonder Woman it's to help us to live the right kind of Godly life that we can absolutely defy hell every day that we are here don't think that it's going to turn us into a bunch of people that's going to start walking in every hospital and emptying them out Jesus didn't even do that and brother brenon didn't do it and we're sure not going to do it we're not going to start walking on these rivers and lakes and Creeks around here but I'll tell you what we will do we'll be so Godly that there'll be something generated out of our soul that people will be able to witness that there is a God that there is a God they may never believe your theology they may never understand your theology but they will not be able to get away from that aura which is around you which can only be brought to this stage when the body reaches this intelligence the feet are awesome oh my the legs the Torso it was awesome there was some great things that happened in Pentecost yes there were it was not all fanaticism it was not all flesh I saw many wonderful things happen in the dispensation of the mouths and the tongues but it was nothing compared to what happened in the eyes but remember there's nothing else that moves Beyond here so you can move your eyes up down sideways back and forth every way you want to move them around around I can't do mine that way I get sick but you can move them but your brain does not move now I saying we don't believe in Movement we do but that's not our main focus amen oh praise the Lord so then why would we as message people want to make the majority of our Focus back down in the mouth so you mean that's what we're focusing on just preaching more and more and more about the the three vocal gifts oh the gifts the gifts the gifts the gift and the gifts the gifts the gift why are we going backwards so you mean the next thing up according to the eyes was the intelligence and some of the Brethren are backtracking and you take the mouth preaching out of what they say oh my pretty sad I think notice again he says there's not one son in the morning and another son in the afternoon it's the same Sun same Sun that's in the afternoon is in the morning the same in the morning is in the afternoon now it said the day itself the day between that time will be kind of a like a dismal dark day it could not be called day or night never May he's quoting Zachariah in between that see that's the forming of the body from the feet coming up so I wonder how many people in here would know me by my feet my grandchildren probably wouldn't Carol might so how many would know you by your feet what about your legs we're decent people we keep them covered up so what are you known by face so your face is made up of what Pentecost Malachi 4 and Christ's intelligence amen so no matter what I would have on I mean oh my if You' have seen me last week and we was hunting in 13 degree weather and I had everything on the world about every s of clothes I had with me on to keep from freeing to death and you would have still recognized me though cuz there's one thing I didn't have covered up and that was my face I had ear muffs on my ears keeping from falling off Brother D but my face was still visible now you could have looked at my legs you would have not known me from the Abominable Snowman man you would have not known me from many of the other Hunters that were there you could have looked at my feet and saw that I had had on really nice warm boots and I had this and that in the other you still wouldn't have known who I was all right we're looking for brother Donnie we're trying to find brother Donnie I don't know that don't look like his feet I don't know what they look like well try to notify me by my knees look at my knees see if that separates look up here around my waist see if that separates me come on up around my chest so that where we look when we look at people we look at them in the face and the face is a relevance of where we are in the end time and you can see why that people can get so confused so easily because the distance from here to here is so close so close that it would deceive the very ele if possible look how close it is from your mouth to your eyes and then how close the eyes to the intelligence so what is it that controls the eyes your intelligence what controls the feet your intelligence your hands what all of that but yet the connection and the flow of divine energy has never been hallelujah what it's supposed to be the last day it wasn't in the feet it wasn't in the thighs in that way it wasn't even in Pentecost because the prophet said what seemed to be the outpouring of the Holy Ghost of that restoration it was not for just a few years it proved that many of them did not even have the Holy Ghost oh my so why friends why would we not want to keep going do we need feet do we need legs do we need tongues do we still need the eyes it's easy to see how some of the message people have that have turned to left from the message you know what when they do they're as blind as a bad I said they're as blind as a bad they're trying to grind to go straight into the intelligence of Christ and bypass the eyes which helps them read to comprehend the intelligence so they go straight from the mouth straight to the head straight from the lips straight up here straight from there straight up to I don't need them eyes if you're going to read you do if you're going to see the future I don't know I don't understand I cannot perceive Without Eyes the eyes told me this is what to look for this will be the signs the eyes told us that church aren't you glad the eyes soulless and then here we are right up here and it's processing processing where the Feet's going what the legs and the thighs did what the Torso did it's looking at Pentecost and processing and divining here's the True Vine here's the false Vine here's the twins in the last days what does that it's not your mouth that processes and discerns it's your intelligence oh Lord Jesus you see that's the forming of the body from the feet from the feet coming up when he was on Earth he was the Sun the likess the likess then he was killed the church took his place praise God the church took his place well it couldn't be said about the Catholic church that they've took his place it couldn't said be said about denomination not many of them that they took his place I don't even believe what he did they don't believe what he said many of them know is that right so they can't take his place so there's got to be a church in the last days that will take his place how can they take his place without his intelligence cuz I guarantee you there's going to be more to seit in this end time than there's ever been watch then he was killed the church took his place then martyred them went through the Dark Ages began to build on the foundation coming out then where does the sight come from at the top of the head then it started right back coming back the church come back from the feet coming up now it's in the head time head time now it's amazing because God sent the eyes while the lips were still talking and God let the eyes see back to the original word and he went around trying to tell the lips and the tongues y'all ain't operating this right you ain't doing right with it you're you're misusing them and and you're you're causing more of a stumbling block than you are a benefit F but did the lips take it did the tongues take it they said oh he don't know he was a Baptist he didn't understand being a Baptist or a Methodist or a heathen didn't make no difference it's the position that he held Oh Glory to God so are we then going back down this way and bypass the enlightenment that the eyes brought to what they had brother Jim you saw it as a young Pentecostal boy others here saw it as a Pentecostal and you'd see gifts that would hit right on and then other things they said was a million miles off thus sayith the Lord this and this and this a preacher text me the other day after the last Wednesday night service that I preached he said remember being a seven-year-old boy in a Pentecostal church and somebody was spoken in tongues and somebody got up and prophesying they started telling a big bunch of stuff and before they got done prophesying they wind up cussing right in church oh that'll never happen to us who say it won't happen to us if we don't judge our prophecy by what they eyes said instead of the mouth now watch oh oh my you can't see with your hands yet it's part of the body you see that's that's in in in every move it's been that way the hands work work work work work work work let's do this let's do that let's do that work work work work work but you see we're privileged in that we know how to send our hands to work through the direction of the eyes and their ages they didn't they did not know brother Harvey exactly how how do we do this how do we do that so they'd work and oh boy they'd do all this and they do all that oh praise God I'll tell you one thing I buy to the Widow some coal and I do this and the other oh that's good but the eyes told us the real meaning of compassion that compassion was not human sympathy but compassion is actually doing the will of God I don't know about you but I've let the devil play on my compassion many a time and help people out socalled and I wouldn't helping them at all I was actually making them worse well I didn't figure y'all like it but that's okay I got the doctrine of the eyes behind me that's what I'm want to judge everything I do don't you so the eyes told us that Jesus when he was on the earth he walked in amongst a multitude of people and went to a man that had a prostate trouble and it wasn't going to kill him he'd been that way for years and years he stepped over the lane the halt the blind the and went to one man and healed him why compassion now what would you have thought if you would have sat there that day and thought that Jesus had that power to heal maybe stepped over a little baby that was crippled another little child that was deformed another one that was mentally off and the Lord Jesus went to a man that was there he wasn't going to die of what he had he had no choice of doing that why he had compassion but we think human sympathy is compassion I never even knew what that really was until the eyes told me well I can tell look in some of y'all's faces y'all just found it out here tonight well good the eyes are still talking ain't they praise the Lord now watch you can't see with your hands yet it's part of the body you can't see with the ears yet it can hear you can't see with the nose yet it smells you can't you can't see with the lips though it speaks see that was the ah okay so they done a lot of talking but they just didn't see very far praise the Lord I can say that not only by theology but by experience oh yeah I've done a lot of running a lot of screaming a lot of Hing hey I've seen a lot of genuine Miracles at the same time I've seen absolutely phenomenal Miracles and I was as dumb as I don't know what when it come to the word why I didn't have no eyes I had a lot of hands to pray for the sick I anointed them with old I run up and down and shouted and screamed and holler I gave everything I had to my mouse Ministry praise the Lord I give everything I had to my tongue Ministry but boy I thank God I finally got some eyes I still talking tongues oh Lord God brother Donnie no oh Lord God yes I do I still I still have feet I've still got legs I've still got all of that but none of that is my emphasis and I am not going backwards and made the emphasis of this day the mouth the tongues the feet Luther Wesley I want to bring all of that up here and let it be connected to the intelligence and then the intelligence move the feet the intelligence move the hands praise God praise God you can't see with the lips though it speaks see that was the Pentecostal age but now it's in the eye time that the seeing now there isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye praise God the next is the intelligence which is Christ itself who controls the whole body so you can see why that people could make denominations do you understand there's a bride on the Earth today that absolutely cannot make an organization now there's people around this message that will and have but the bride cannot why because the intelligence of God will not allow her to do so so it's not just the eyes oh I can see I can see I can see the next thing is friends we don't want to stop just say oh brother Brandon was so wonderful yes he was he was a great servant of God a great prophet of God but I'm praying I hope you are for the very last thing in this body I'm not looking for brother brandom to come back oh yes he's raising in the resurrection but I'm not looking for a tent come on somebody I'm not looking no sir I'm not looking for him to have a private Resurrection never taught any such thing I am looking for the resurrection of the Dead not just one but all of those in Christ Jesus that's what I'm looking for and I will be changed how can me a 68 year old man go back to being 18 to 20 because the intelligence tells me to so the altar of eternal life living in my soul and stepped into my mystical part one day tells me Donnie become a young man and it will divinely charge me and run through my mortal body and all of a sudden all the scars and the beets and the bangs and the gray hair and this and that and the other that I've got and the wrinkles that I've got praise God they will be gone why because the Divine intelligence tells me so so we could have the feet we could have the hands we could have the lips we could have the tongues we can even have the mental aspect of the eyes but if we don't get the intelligence we won't go in the body change you see there's a mental facei to every one of these moves that was a mental facei to the feet a mental Faith to the knees and The Shins and all of that there was a mental Faith to the tongues and there is a mental faith I said oh yes I believe every word that Prophet said that's just words that's just words if you believe it you'll do it that's right you will do it and this message the eyes will lead you to the intelligence Christ I'm not here to worship brother brandham I'm not here to baptize in his name come on church we are not here to Rally around any man we are here to Worship the Lord Jesus we are here to magnify his name he's the Healer he's the Savior he's the deliverer he's the one we worship [Applause] tonight oh my the next is the intelligence which is Christ itself who controls the whole body no moving motion beyond that everything else has moved move your feet move your muscles in your legs move everything your ears can move your nose your lips and so forth but after your eyes there was nothing moves you know what it does takes human Works away from you and I makes us totally dependent upon Our Savior himself you can't beg you can't scream enough you can't beat the altar you can't cry you can't fast enough it's got to be the spirit of God in you now the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer there is the soul souls in prison now now we find out on that part you see there is nothing beyond the eye every form every move every place in the body positionally shows us the very hour we're living in so just by looking at the spiritual anatomy of where we are right here friends right here not down here not not down here not down here can't you see and science has keeps on going going going and the sad part about it is religion is stale stale and stale so the lutherans are hundreds of years behind the methodists are hundreds of years behind the Pentecostals are many many years behind and it's sad to say but some of the people in the message are many many years behind they're waiting on brother B to come back oh that's when the Revival's coming Ain't nobody got the Holy Ghost Say say ain't nobody adopted Sons Ain't nobody got this we're all just kind of waiting hanging out for brother Bram to come that's an absolute Lie from the pits of Hell there's a bride on the face of the Earth the same has the same holy ghost that Peter had that Paul had on the day of Pentecost the same one brother Skip and they're doing the same works but this is part of the intelligence you see Paul had that when Paul said I wanted to go here I wanted to go there but the spirit wouldn't let me so you see it's not about you it's not even about your ministry or your gift it's not about you being promoted and you being something else it's about the intelligence and if he tells you no don't go here no don't do that oh but you see friends this is the scary part that there is a satanic artificial intelligence and it's very very spiritual that's why the prophet when he preaches Harvest Time F but listen that you need to that he said Satan can hand out them gifts Supernatural gifts by the handfuls and he said if you won't leave the word then he'll try to make you a supernatural offer he might let you speak in tongues he might let you prophesy he said even though it be a milon miles off the word ah but it's supernatural what is that a false artificial intelligence to try to move the body what was that thing in the Garden of Eden that got a hold of Eve it was another another intelligence instead of the spirit of God God knows in the day you eat there oh my that that you can't believe all that stuff God's trying to keep something from you don't you understand what the devil was doing tried to get her run ahead of the program of God she would have finally become a mother by the spoken word oh people to think of that how many brides revivals have we had through this message how many have come oh Lord hasten the day that the last one will arrive and the true bride will be waiting for the manifestation of that word a promise to live itself out of her life will there be healings yes there will not only healings Resurrection from the dead oh praise the Lord notice this every form every move every place in the body shows this position the very hour we're living in not another move can come above it there was a move of the hand charity Wesley there was a move of the foundation lucer charity never a greater it was called Wesley move they sent missionaries to all the world look qu a big move this was in the Wesley move look how big they went everywhere such love they sent missionaries all the world one of the greatest moves that was ever made in the age before then it come to the Pentecostal age then come in the different fingers and things the Pentecostal age of tongues and nose and so forth uh it's probably one of the reasons that some of the Pentecostal said I smell a demon here tonight uhhuh that's Pentecostal oh I know all those some of our message preachers say the same thing the prophet of God said you can't smell no demon I'm going to take the eyes what the eyes said instead of a flopping Mouse well praise the Lord I'll tell you one thing children the the problem is some of our Brethren are taking and bypassing the teach in of the eyes as if though he did not understand the mouth and the problem is because they actually think brother Brenham taught something different than Paul did woo I figured y'all be quiet tonight but I figured at least somebody say Amen or ouch or just wiggle your finger let me know you're with me or something now do we believe in the Supernatural gifts of God yes we do as a church notice now the gifts are actually sent to keep the church clean not to magnify this brother that speaks in tongues or this brother that interprets or this sister that would be able to prophesy it's not it's not about that it's to edify the body and the gifts are there to work in the church to keep the church clean notice this Wood River Illinois we just passed through there Monday night he said into the church Apostles prophets Gifts of tongues interpretation of tongues that's all for the edifying or keeping the keeping clean of the church okay so if we are truly seeing the gifts of God is there any house cleaning going on so in tongues interpretation and prophecy are going forth is to tell people to clean up this in their life and that in their life I'm not talking about generic now I'm talking about something that's so identifiable oh you say I saw it in Pentecost were preachers I don't know why but it's always been this way for years that preachers wanted to be above and beyond just the regular preacher guy you know you just go to church you study and you preach and you pray and you try to feed God's people and you try to live right and all that but there's been Aire are and many men that they wanted to be so Supernatural and so profound you know they just had to look at you really strange and make you feel really eerie they look at you very strange the next thing you know you know your hair standing up on the back of your neck you say Lord have mercy what in the world don't you think them men can't tell that don't you think they cannot tell when you get nervous they know enough about body language to see you are oh there's somebody here tonight that's got a need they've got this or that or the other baloney brother Tony be careful no you be careful cuz what I'm going to read to you is through the eyes I saw what the mouth does I experienced that I saw it heard what the lips do it just flat out bothers me friends that we see some of our brothers doing exactly the same thing as Pentecost and calling it The Bride move it ain't no bride move at this church if you folks want to vote me out that's fine if y'all getting tired of hearing me preach that's okay get you somebody else if that's what you want but as long as I'm here I'm going to tell you what these eyes said I'm leading you I'm trying my best to lead you up to this next stage of the intelligence why do we want to go back down to here and say oh this is it this is it this is it no this is not it we've done past that sure we bring it with us but that's not the emphasis of this hour I need help I need help and I'm not going to get it just from muttering in tongues and I believe in that I thank God I still speak in tongu but I need intelligence I need wisdom I need knowledge I need the leadership of the spirit of God I don't get it from my mouth notice again he said first as Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors those five god-given gifts in the church so each of your people who has a Godly Pastor has a gift from God in your church a Shepherd pastor means a Shepherd to watch over the flock to teach them the word of God then these other nine different spiritual gifts should be operating in the church amen but now remember here's the way it'll happen so the mouths opened and the tongue spoke and the lips framed the words under Pentecost much of what was said was not even the Lord it was impression it was thinking that's what the Lord said but God said I am not going to let this word of mine fall down and never be accomplished so I'm going to send the eyes and the eyes are going to retrain my bride and my bride they may not have the multitude that the lips has got but they'll be talking right thinking right singing right living right and flying light glory to God we're fixing to leave out of this place children now notice so God is going to bring all you say well he done away with all that you show me where the Bible says that he done away with all of that God's Prophet never taught that once we get up here in the intelligence and up in the eye we didn't need no Supernatural while a great portion of his ministry was based on Supernatural we still need Supernatural oh thank the Lord for it too then these other nine spiritual gifts should be operating in the church to keep the church clean amen ah then what does the eyes do the eyes goes to the bottom of the pyramid crosses over from the human anatomy type and goes over into the Mountain of God type and goes right down to the original foundation of the pyramid and pull from that original foundation in the book of Acts now this is what the gifts are supposed to do in the church keep the church perfected and clean my notice like ananas and Safara so when ananas wed up before Peter what' Peter say a brother now now uh you you've got a need now oh boy something man wow man well I don't understand people they just n fall out when somebody says something like come on a sinner could say that what did Peter tell him why did Satan put in your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost was not this proper to yours why did you and your wife make this deal look come on let's produce the gifts this way okay but much of it is said in such a way that you never really know if it comes to pass or not there's no dates there's no dead lines there's no this or that or the other it's so generic come on I know folks is going to get mad at me they're already mad at me already but that's all right the intelligence is Blessing Me praise the Lord you realize now that their God's Prophet ties it right back to the book of Acts the spirit of God rise up and call somebody out and tell them they're living wrong why to rebuke that sin openly brother sister you got something in your life so and so and so and so and you say good Lord we come back in here Sunday I mean I realize I may not been near as many of us but hey do we want God or do we want to play Church you tell me do we want God in reality do we want TR whether or not you want it ananas and Safara will return in the last days amen it's not just going to be men that are been magnified and I prayed for so and so and this happened if you haven't listened to thetive Spirit March of 1960 I advise you listen to it and you hear the prophet of God talking about Discerning spirits on men and watching how they do with a Great Mighty gift and see if they try to use that gift to bring glory and honor to thems then he said you're not really judging that man but you're judging his attitude and his you know whatever that he's doing with that gift so you know what I'm I'm protected by the eyes to do such now watch he said that's what the holy spirit is in the church for to keep the church clean and ready for the coming of the Lord so for our churches around the message that have the gifts moving is that what it's doing testing one two3 test 112 so is it telling brother Keith brother Keith you done this and this on Monday brother you should not have done that repent does it tell brother Rob brother rob you should not have said this to your wife sister Sarah just because she burnt your cornbread before church you had an awful attitude brother repent for that brother Rob and Sister Sarah look at each other and say he looks over honey I'm so sorry but does the modern message rendition make anybody repent and clean yeah the Lord say I'm here and now the Lord said I bless you all and how the Lord say I do this and how the Lord say i' do that and I said i' do this you're quoting scripture and the prophet said prophecy is not that way amen and the church said but you see the problem we're going back to the mouth and we're cons Consul in Mouse theology instead of Consulting our theology in order to use the mouse to bring it out the right way this is why Satan don't want it right this is why he wants us to accept a substitute that hits and misses listen friends there was things said about my daughter Erica that did not have happen and never will happen is it hurtful very is it disappointing very what's even more disappointing than something been said that's wrong but men without the guts to come to you and apologize and say I said something wrong please forgive me stand out before forever they preach that I'm so sorry I I I I I I said the Lord said that or or I told him that was the Lord come on don't get quiet Lord of Mercy if you get any quieter you a bunch of Egyptian mummies there were Supernatural occurrences socalled that happened that supposedly was supposed to be about my daughter that never happened and never will so we just let things go come on now now I made the offer here a few weeks ago everybody that's mad at me to get me a gift card there's only one person that done it and it was a preacher friend of mine he wasn't even mad at me look friends I saw gifts with hit Miss hit Miss hit Miss I'm not interested in hit Miss I'm interested in hit hit hit hit hit every time on target one more quote and I'll let you go now we said in the church to keep the church in line with the word what tapes tapes tapes tapes and more tapes you say a man who tapes that and says tapes is a liar and he don't believe what the Bible said nor what the prophet said keep on you're going to get me killed sir God sent men not man called God sent inspired men to keep the church lined up now what is it gifts of the spirit in the church not a bunch of fanaticism but truly gifts of the Spirit in the church that's right keeping the church if a real church is ordained of God really filled with the Holy Spirit if sin would appear in the church it would be another ananas and Safara okay so our churches look down on because we don't have tongues interpretation of Prophecy going on every service or every other service and we're not supposed to be spiritual but for the those who are operating it where is ananas and Safar if somebody had done something wrong the Holy Spirit rise right up and reveal it that have to clean up the gifts of the Spirit in the church oh God oh God send us a church like that now watch here's the eyes saying oh God send us a church like that not doing away with the mouth not doing away with the lips but Harry now we know how to judge it right why the gifts are put in the church to separate and take sin out to keep the church clean it's God's toxin that's given to the church also his disinfect wow so you mean gifts are like a disinfectant a spiritual LOL or a spiritual bleach you know or spiritual ammonia wo boy that stuff most of that stuff I just mentioned has got a terrible Aroma to it don't it and it'll burn your hands and you don't like smelling it come on somebody but that's what the real gifts are so the real gifts that put off this sweet adorable man worshiping Aroma you need some ammonia come on somebody you need to get rid of your glory of Vanderbilt you need to get rid of your Gambler musk and all that sort of thing and get some of God's good oldfashioned this and infectant it'll kill that love of Pride it'll kill that arrogance it'll kill that man worship it'll kill that idolatry of lifting men to a place that they shouldn't [Applause] be oh my let me tell you some friends I do not judge the word by a spirit I judge Spirits by the word let's stand pray praise the lord it's been good knowing y'all if I don't see you again I realize some of my brothers are taking clips from my sermons and passing them around that's okay as long as my voice is identified saying what the eyes said I have no problem with that now have any of you all heard me quote Donnie Reagan tonight as far as I know we have no Donnie Reagan quote books do we I mean I've never seen one myself so what was I reading to you tonight from the eyes let's go back down to the foundation of the pyramid 1 Corinthians 144 he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifies himself but he that prophesy look at the meaning of the word speak forth by Divine interpretations to predict ah here's where it gets scary you see this is where when brother brandham and his own church corrected the people and went to Brother Neville and told him said brother Neville leave them alone they're babies we can't judge it now so he said when it come time to set it in order he said a lot of what they was saying never even come to pass in the brandham Tabernacle and whenever he set Church order in he said a big bunch of them left they pulled away from the teaching of the eyes and left Hallelujah and he said one man told him will you put us on the spot he said don't you think I'm on the spot when I stand before hundreds or thousands of people and tell them your name is so and so you went to a doctor yesterday and this and this but thus sayeth the Lord by next week this time you'll be made well right I tell you friends it's absolutely phenomenal how many Pentecostal people are putting out testimonies on YouTube I saw one not long ago of a man that went to Brother bram's meetings when he was a young boy and his father and mother was there and brother brandham called out a woman and they knew this woman and brother bandam called her out and told her said you live in streets so and so such and such and so and so and that man and woman looked at one another and said we know her that's not where she lives that's not where she lives and they said Oh Brother R and missed it brother R and missed it so they went to that woman after church but you see the thing of it was the Holy Ghost had already updated her address book but they didn't know it so they go to her and said oh sister you know brother R called you out and he he gave you the wrong address he said oh no brother sister I I just I just moved that's what I'm talking about amen hallelujah may God grant to us this to prophesy with the idea of foretelling future events pertaining especially to the kingdom of God to utter Force declare a thing which can only be known by divine revelation this is why it cannot be a repeating of script scriptures that's known by reading a real prophecy of God tells something that's not even in the in the written word you can see why there'll be few and far between but I'd rather have it three times a year or four operating the mouth from the intelligence down to the teaching of the eyes and then Focus this way instead of bypassing the eyes and coming straight to the mouth oh we don't believe in that old church or we don't believe that old church order be careful what you're saying that's not my terms that's the prophet's terms I want gifts too but this is the order I want them not from here out from here down through the teachings of the eyes and then it comes down this way so if one says say I'm an interpreter of tongues and this is the way we'll judge them all right brother sisters so do you hear them speaking in tongues in English well no I just feel led to say it then you don't have an interpretation cuz the eyes says that you hear it in your native language which you was born in but friends this is the problem some of the folks feel out brother brandom was not saying what Paul said I honestly don't know how you could follow a prophet like that so what else did he say that Paul didn't say but them folks that was carried beyond the curtain of time when he said will all leaders be judged he said yes well he said if Paul's people goes in mine will too cuz what Paul preached I preached millions of voices screamed out we are resting on that I'm going to say it tonight that's what I'm resting on if God's Prophet taught for us to do a certain thing do it this way and that way whether or not I even understand it I'm going to do it and if it comes down to opinions I'll even take his own opinion over my own yeah cuz he was eyes I'm just barely a cell stuck somewhere in the middle of the body come on children I don't do my opinion the way some preachers do and they exalt their opinion above the eyes that's pretty foolish if you ask me don't you love him don't you see the last false bride move whatever it is the last false so-called brid Revival when the last one strikes and hits just the other day I saw a message preacher clip that was sent to me said the end is tomorrow the Lord's coming tomorrow so y'all just forget everything cuz it's it's tomorrow then I got another clip a week later and he said the Lord has delayed is coming them hundreds of people ought to kicked him out but instead most of them would be right there screaming and hollering God have mercy on us children do you realize how many message people are going to be lost absolutely lost without God why they do not value this word they handle this word like it's a toy they handle this word like it's a Play-Doh and God's Prophet said three times in the Bible it was an unpardonable sin to add one word of your own interpretation to a message after you have been Vindicated to be the truth unpardonable sin there will be message people that will walk up to the white Throne convinced that they're going into heaven and the Lord Jesus will look at them and say depart from me I gave you eyes and you refused him may God help us one of the scariest categories in this message is preachers how many have we had that a walk before God as lost as a harlot as lost as a drun why because they exalted their own opinion above the eyes of Malachi 4 you see God allowed his Prophet to leave out certain things on purpose why did Jesus say father son Holy Ghost it was said on purpose why were many things left out even in the message left out on purpose so these mongr and Seed of the serpent would come around and say well he almost said it that's what he meant how can we say what he meant my Lord sometimes I don't even know what I mean I don't even know what you mean that's what a prophet meant but don't you understand God does it that way because it's a temptation to man it's a temptation to human beings to want to go ahead and say it just I just got to say go ahead but I want to say what's been spoken yep you know what you come back 20 years from now if I'm still alive then still preaching you know what you're going to hear me preaching the same message you heard 35 years ago when I was here some of the folks and I came here 30 some years ago they didn't like what I was preaching they've come back again I'm still preaching the same thing well they leave and come back again another 10 years if we're still here 10 years you know what I'll be preaching same thing same thing they didn't believe 35 years ago same thing they didn't believe 25 years ago same thing they didn't believe last year so where does people with unbelief stand before God lost lost I sent you prophets and you killed them Prophet tells us about it in sort they said they do the same thing in every generation God will send them a prophet then about another generation they'll polish his tomb and make an idol out of his life make an idol out of his life we are not Amish we are not menites we're not following Joseph Menon we're not looking for another man to make our Idol brother BR never come to make us branhamites he come to make us Sons and Daughters of God to lead us back to a new birth that's what he tells us was the theme of his life in the church age book that men and women would have a closer walk with God except what the message has done for you don't you love the message I'll tell you one thing I love it now more than ever before we're under more persecution and I it's going all over the United States and newspapers and you know all kinds of newscasts and this and that and the other and it shows to me the devil is more scared of this message now than he was in 1965 he hates this message why ain't he doing that to the Bible why ain't he doing that to Martin Luther why ain't he doing that to Pentecost why this message is the Capstone it's the eyes you cannot get to the intelligence from the mouth up you got to have that Capstone right there on the next thing to the intelligence is the eyes itself forgive me if for going on long let let's pray together oh dear Jesus what an hour to be living Lord how I thank you for this message Lord God we want the word to be our absolute we want our church to be built upon that absolute of the word I thank you for some of the experiences I had in Pentecost because I found an element of reality there though it was mixed up with a lot of mess but Lord Jesus I'm so grateful that there was a deep down inside of me hungering for more I had Miracles I had tongues I had interpretation and I had prophecy so if that's all I needed then why did I ever need to come to the message why wasn't I happy why wasn't I satisfied why was it when I come across that Wolf Creek Dam that night and your presence filled that automobile and my hair was standing up on my arms and I was so under the presence of the Lord by myself in that car that I had to pull over just as I crossed the dam and I was afraid to even look sitting there with my eyes closed and my head bowed and I heard your voice in the back seat and it like just scared me to death Lord you remember the night I wasn't even following the message didn't believe it then but you spoke my destiny and you told me there was something greater right just ahead me and my mouth thinking I saw maybe more signs more wonders more gifts this that the other I didn't know exactly what it was but it was what I was ordained to walk in you said I didn't even believe in predestination I didn't even believe in ordination oh I could quote it from the Bible but I was quoting it from my mouth's understanding so the intelligence come back in the back seat of my car and spoke out my destiny oh Jesus oh Jesus help us Lord father I pray for every man woman boy and girl in this place tonight maybe Satan's wiring them out with their failures and their mistakes and their shortcomings but may the intelligence of Christ the Holy Ghost himself maybe they're back sting maybe they're in a cold State tonight Lord but may you speak from within themsel from within their soul and say daughter you are not called to be this but you're called to a higher call son you're called to a higher place oh God woo each heart each child of yours father I say to you tonight with all sincerity of my my heart these are the gifts I so desire I don't want hits misses flesh things not even said in such a way that it can be proven or disproved that if it's said the preachers take glory and if it's said in such a way that it seems that come to pass they take Glory but it's also said in such a way if it don't come to pass they never said thus sayeth the Lord so well I was just trying to encourage them and yet we as message people swallow it down it ain't no wonder the Rapture ain't come lord it's evident we're not ready we're letting the mouse dictate to us what our services ought to be we're letting the mouth tell us what it should be God we want our services to be what the intelligence tells us through the eyes and comes down through the mouth and speaks out the way you said it should be Lord granted father I'd rather have a dozen true prophecies in our church in 8 10 years whatever it would be than to have a whole bunch of Flesh and a whole bunch of stuff that ain't even in reality Prophecy in the first place no sir I don't want it I want the real send us genuine speakers with tongues genuine interpreters genuine ones that can speak true prophecy true discerners Lord and that discernment that belongs in the church body is not to replicate the prophet's gift cuz the eyes told us your pastor won't do this cuz there's only one to a generation we believe what them eyes had to say Lord but father we want discerners that can discern whether tongues are true tongues interpretation is true interpretation cuz that's what the eyes told us but of course many of our brothers are going back and insulting the mouth we don't want the mouth interpretation we see what it brought them to some of the quotes Lord that I've read in the last several months even dealing with question answers to the youth was taken from the sermon the prophet entitled where I think Pentecost failed and it was preached in 1955 and in a few days we'll be entering in the year of 2025 and we have some of the same things happening that he preached against in 1955 are we no farther up the road Lord help us Jesus Purge us Lord cleanse us oh God Hallelujah Jesus anybody here tonight feel that way Lord search me search me Lord Purge me what do we want in our church friends real gifts or just so-called ones that we can't identify Through The Eyes the only identification they have is through the mouth because the eye says something totally different give me the eye understanding as a matter of fact if you listen carefully to God being misunderstood you'll find God's Prophet speaking to the brothers at the church and said Brothers if you all will trust my understanding of the scriptures I'd like to come down with you that are gifted and show you how it's supposed to be set in order because that's the way Paul did it and that's the way it was done in the New Testament ah so the eyes identified with the foundation stone in the pyramid which means the alpha has become the Omega how many wants it that way can we just bow our heads and now remember we're not seeking after gifts I'm not making an altar called tonight oh how many wants a gift of tongues how many oh yes oh God oh God give me tongues oh God give me interpretation no but we desire I desire them yeah by Desiring that I'm not saying that I desire that I have them I'm saying I desire them in our body God can give it to everyone so God may give it to one of our sisters is that right would you brothers be okay with that the Holy Ghost can follow one of our sisters and give true tongues and fall on another sister interpretation yeah I'm fine with that amen I don't want it just to be on me or just the preacher's family or just me and the deacons and you know the the ones I can control I don't believe it ought to be me controlling them I believe it ought to be the Holy Ghost we desire earnestly the best gifts Lord those that will edify the body and help keep our church clean praise the Lord can we just pray together oh I know this is a solemn time hallelujah hallelujah oh Jesus help us father it's no wonder that your Prophet said that the Pentecostals and the mouth age they had so misused the gifts that he said just the mention of their name and it brought reproach and he said no wonder people didn't want them because of the way that they had misused him and they had made a reproach on it Lord there's people here like myself that saw gifts and if the gift was 100% wrong why nobody would listen to that but if it's hit and missed and hit and missed in the last few years Lord I've heard of one after another after another who went through prayer lines and was told this and that and the other you come up here with this person on your heart and they emphatically denied and said that is not true I did not have that person on my mind at all Lord Jesus help us Lord we don't want no guessing we want real father we want want real tongues real interpretation real wisdom real Discerning of spirits word of knowledge Word of Wisdom oh Jesus let the genuine fall Among Us oh God to keep Word of Life Church clean Lord when we get into it a little bit more and your Prophet crosses the country in the mouth age telling them how they ought to use them and little or none of them hardly any of them paid any attention to him brother Greg Parker told me some time ago about a church that he used to go to a Pentecostal Church in Louisiana that had the gifts that way I was flabbergasted by it by hearing it but they actually had it set up the way the prophet taught it they'd meet and gather and pray had men there Discerning the whole thing I thought my goodness what a rebuke a Pentecostal church that did it that way and message churches ridicule the prophets quotes and make light of his words that he used God forgive them I pray lay it not to their charge father may we judge our church Through The Eyes not through the mou Mouse if we were in the mouse age we would judge it by what the mouse understood and comprehended but we're in the eyes right next to the intelligence how foolish we are to bypass the eyes and go straight to the mouth and consult Pentecostal theologians how they did and what they've done oh Jesus help us father I pray we worship you tonight Lord God we bless your name Lord Jesus can we just lift our hands now in the presence of the king I know you kids got school tomorrow and you got to work tomorrow and you got to go but let's just worship a little bit let the Lord pour a little bit of oil in our wounds you know the word has that about it that it kind of cuts us up but that's all right if I need cutting tonight Lord let me have it I want to be ready father praise the Lord how many will say to me with me tonight as a person who comes here to this assembly let all hell know tonight where you stand how many will say with me by the uplifting of your hand you believe in true gifts you want true gifts in our church that will keep the church clean then don't any of you who stream our services and say we don't believe in gifts you are lying amen and not only will God judge you but we will judge you amen I do believe in them but remember the prophet tells us in the church age book that there will be men appear in the last day who will operate gifts with a margin of error I've seen what the error can do to people I've been dealing with some message people that have come through the margin of error and Gifts things that have been told them that were not true that did not come to pass I've seen the tears I've seen the anxiety and for some it has nearly destroyed them and you mean to tell me that's what gifts do no friends gifts don't cause the confusion it straightens it out God don't send gifts with margins of error you get perfect love first then you'll get perfect gifts so let me tell you this people who are operating gifts and our message that are imperfect they miss the foundation stone it's not so much their gift they don't have perfect love when they need to have it perfect love God's Prophet said produces perfect gifts am amazing grace How Sweet the Sound that save a rich like me I want was lost but now I'm found I was blind oh thank God for now I can [Music] see when we been there 10 th can

while he was doing it he was pulling these on an iPad so he started pulling this Pulsar 69 and this pulsar and its noise and then this other thing was me and then he started pulling in the whales and they [Music] were and it sounded like an orchestra of voices and then they put it all together and put it under a a gospel song that's sung on this in this day about greatly to be praised and worshipping the Our God and how great he is and there was the stars and there was the whales and their voices was matching in Harmony and in the same pitch and the same tone as that song and I thought

they're taking 13 biopsies 12 out of 13 were cancerous cells a doctor prepared us for the worst believe haha the cancer had spread the original CT scan showed he had three pinholes in his pelvic bone

If you missed the word Friday night and yesterday, it would do you really good to go back and listen to it. Um the evidence of salvation. So um that being said, you know, we're going to have activities here. Well, food for everyone. Brother Tony McGraw and Sister Jennifer. Um we I was in here late last night and they were still in there cooking for today. So, make sure and thank them. Brother Matt Willis. Um and those that cooked um lunch for us yesterday. Um thank you so much for that. And all the sisters and help if you would give all them a hand for helping. [applause] [applause] But I want to say that what I'm really thankful for is our youth. Um, you know, there's a lot of places they could have been this weekend, but they chose to come to come sit around the word. And, you know, I'm so grateful for that. And if I don't mean to bore you, you can sit down if I'm boring you. But um when you look at the youth and and in and the way that the devil is is going against the youth nowadays, the things that Satan offers the youth, you know, Brother Donnie asked me about four years ago, pull me in the office and asked me if I would help with the youth. And I I told him I I said, \"I I'll not do it without brother Rob.\" And uh some of you parents that have kids my kids age of my kids when we didn't have all of this brother Rob two or three times a week would have the youth at his house singing doing games fellowshipping. I've often told him, \"Brother Rob, I have no idea where my kids would be. If it hadn't been for you and Sister Sarah, we understand God is the glue that holds these youth together, but God needs a little brush sometimes to put it on.\" Brother Rob's been that. He always preaches, \"Find a new friend, love somebody.\" And he don't always say it. Him and Sister Sarah have been that by example. And I don't I don't He's been a mentor to me. He's been around youth. He's not a minister. He don't claim to be, but he puts a lot of youth ministers to shame by the life he lives in front of our youth. And you know, Brother Donnie always says, \"Give them a rose while they're here.\" &gt;&gt; You know, so I I I I wouldn't be able to do this without him and without brother Donnie giving us the the leadership to do it. So, if you would give Brother Rob, sister Sarah a hand. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's take these needs before the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so grateful, Lord. Lord, where would we be if we didn't have the word of of this day, the message of the hour to come sit around, Lord, and lay our needs on top of it. Lord, as we've heard in the last week or two, Father, how your prophet said this was a sacred desk. If these needs, Lord, have been written down. They've been laid on this desk. Lord, we know this desk cannot heal them. This desk cannot meet those needs. But the anointing that you've placed in here because everyone here has brought that anointing with them. Father, you've sanctified this place. Lord, this is not a place to come in and criticize. It's not a place to come in and be bitter and hold grudges and not even a place to come in and think about what we're going to do when we get out of here. This is a place where we come, Lord, and we lay our needs at your feet and we re renew our strength for the days that lie ahead, Father. every need that's been written down, Lord. You're mindful of everyone. Not one is greater than the other. They're all great needs in your sight, Lord. So, we know that if we pull our faith together, if we believe, Father, in your word that you said, Lord, if we had faith the size of a grain of a mustard seed, we could say to this mountain, \"Be thou removed and cast into the sea, Father, and it would be done.\" But you also said, \"Sometimes you got to climb that mountain.\" So give us strength for one and faith for the other. Lord, we thank you for it. We're believing you for it. Pray, Lord, that the minister comes, Father, that you would anoint him as you have in the last two days. Meet every need with your word, Father. Bless the music that's played, Brother Aaron, Father, and all the songs that songs that are sung. We give you glory in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; We appreciate Brother Joe a little bit too this morning, don't we? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing this little course. Brothers want to come receive the morning tithing offering [music] at this time. Um, also, we got three specials this morning. If they'd be making their way to the platform, uh, Sister Emily Allen, Sister Lydia, Sister Elise.

And for that sacred moment, [singing and music] no doubt can in [singing] her fear in the presence [singing] [music] of Jehovah. [singing] God [singing] Almighty, prince of peace, [singing and music] trles, [singing] hearts are [singing] men In the [singing] presence [music] of the king [music] through his [singing] love the Lord provided.

In [singing] the presence [music] of [singing] the king. [singing] [applause] It's awesome what his presence can do. Prostitutes have walked into his presence, walked out changed. The blind were carried into his presence and walked out with their sight. Church members walked into his presence, became sons and daughters of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I guess the question today is for us. What do you have need of? &gt;&gt; I believe he's here. Don't you? &gt;&gt; He promised us whether it's two or three gathered together in my name, I'll be in his midst. We're so happy and grateful that all the visitors have been with us and our days has been set aside for these youth services and trust that something has been said or done that'll help you in your journey. We by no means have meetings like this to try to hinder or to hurt or to bring any type of thing in a negative way that would hinder your walk with God. I'm grateful that we still have men of God in this day who have given their life for the cause of Jesus Christ. Aren't you? Let's stand together. We'll invite brother Matt to come and just bring to us what what the Lord has placed upon his heart for today. Um we welcome each of you that are here in our gates with us and we trust that God will meet with us in a very special way. He's the only one that could be able to custom fit a service to where every hungry heart could have something. Amen. Sing something for us, Harry. [music] Let's just open our hearts together to the Lord now. And just whatever you have need now remember a minister studies and God gives him thoughts and scriptures and quotes and ideas and it goes to putting it together. And maybe your need lays outside the confines of what he's actually studied. But remember, you have the ability to pull on the gift. And the Holy Ghost can so come and minister to you in such a way. It may not be but two, three sentences or a paragraph. But those two, three sentences will change your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. woman [music] tried so many [singing] Jesus. Thank you, Father. Yet grew [singing and music] worse. So did Jesus. She came. [singing] [music] And when [singing] the unbelievers tried to frame her [singing] [music] she whispered these words [music] everybody together through her [singing] pain. This is what we [music] want to do. Oh, touching Jesus [singing] is all [music] that really matter. [music] And then [singing] your life will never be this. You believe that with all your [music] heart. Thank you, Lord, for there's only [singing] one way to touch. [music] You must [singing] believe when you [music] call on. Let's sing the chorus once together again, everybody. [music] Oh, touching Jesus [music] is all that really matters. [music] Thank you, Father. And [singing] then your [music] life will never [music] [singing] [music] [music] His name [music] is all [singing] that really matter. Then [music and singing] your life will never be [music] the same. For [singing] there's only [music] one way to touch him [music] and just believe when you call on his [music] name. [singing] My just a wonderful presence opportunity that we have to be gathered together. My I just feel the presence of the Lord is here. And as we're just singing this song, maybe they'll just keep playing that. We'll go into prayer. Touching Jesus. &gt;&gt; It It's all It's all that that matters. &gt;&gt; I mean, nothing else matters &gt;&gt; is touching Jesus. And when he comes by and he comes by your way and he starts to deal with your heart and and you know what I love about his presence and touching Jesus, it's it's not always words. It's not something that can be said. It's just his presence. &gt;&gt; And in his presence there's fullness of life and there's joy. There's there's peace. There's there's deliverance. There's there's comfort. It it seems like when he comes by, all the questions that you had, they kind of just melt away and the only thing that matters is him and him alone and and and you're with Jesus and you know, and the heartache and the pain and the struggle and all those things, you know, you start to understand it's going to be okay. It's going to be all right cuz I'm with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Why don't we just go before our Lord, Lord Jesus, how we love you. And truly, Lord, as the song would sing, [music] touching Jesus is all that really matters. [snorts] Lord, how many of us here this morning could testify that you've come by and you've touched our heart and you touched our life, Lord? And Lord, we had the need of salvation and we had the need of deliverance and we were lost sinners and undone. Lord, your great love where in which you loved us, you saw fit to come and pluck us out of the muck and the mire and to let us know that you loved us and you forgave us of all of our sin and you've raised us up into heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Lord, what an hour, what an opportunity, what a privilege. Lord, we want to tell you we love you, &gt;&gt; Lord. Thank you for doing that, Lord. Thank you for Calvary, Lord. Thank you for shedding your blood that I could be forgiven and I could be free, Lord, from the things of this world and not in bondage, but have a real liberty, Lord, to serve you and to love you and to love this message of the hour that's called us out of the darkness of Lady Oilia, Lord, and it set us free to soar in heavenly places. Oh, how we thank you, Lord. Lord, as we just turn to the preaching of the word, Lord, I need you to come and just Lord, anoint myself to get out of the way. Anoint the ears of the hearer, Lord. And Lord, I always think of that that boy that had those fishes and loaves and there was the multitude and he didn't have enough to feed the people. But when he placed it into your hands, &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; It was more than enough. &gt;&gt; They were taking up fragments and had leftovers, Lord. And I pray that, Lord, these scriptures and quotes that I have placed down, Lord, you'd just take it into your hands now. And you'll minister to the needs of your people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have your Bibles, we'll be reading out of Romans chapter 8. uh Romans chapter 8, a very familiar scripture and uh verse 10. But I just want to thank uh brother Joe and brother Donnie for the opportunity to uh be in fellowship with you all and to speak to you. It's just been such a privilege uh to be here and an honor and and I started to realize and look out uh a lot of the young people that I've come to know and and see in different places and those from brother Josh Bennett and other uh churches uh am I just coming from Arizona and Oklahoma and certain places. I thought my goodness is this is wonderful to see all the saints of God. We just love each one of you and want you young people to know that we love you and cherish you and are proud of you. &gt;&gt; Really proud of you because you are the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And it's just a wonderful thing. And and while I have this uh opportunity, I I do want to let uh uh brother Donnie know how much I've appreciated him and his ministry and sister Carol and and my I I've over the years, you know, over the last 25 years of just being able to hear Brother Donnie minister, I I I when I I love a a ministry that it just pulls something out of you. It just identifies something in your soul. And and I just want to thank brother Donnie for your stand and unwavering compromise on the message of the hour. [applause] [applause] I I I've I've I've been a great beneficiary of the gift of God that he's placed in this body of Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, we do bring greetings from our pastor, brother David Mciri and the Saints in Bedford, Texas. and just want to move right into the word and see what God would have for us. Amen. Romans chapter 8 and verse 10, it would read, \"And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you.\" Amen. You may be seated. And also just want to read a scripture we read on the opening night uh in Galatians 3 and verse 29. Galatians 3 and 29. It says, \"If ye be Christ, then are you Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise.\" And we read the uh this quote out of possessing all things as we ministered on the evidence of salvation. Uh, brother Brandham says just what Joshua did for the children of Israel. Joshua means savior. The word Joshua and that's the same thing Jesus done for the church when they killed him. He conquered death. He conquered hell. He conquered the grave. And he rose up again with the evidence, the baptism of the Holy Ghost that there is a land beyond the river that they call the sweet forever. Amen. And he come back and brought us an evidence. What does it do, brother Brandham? It makes you stop your lying, stealing, drinking, cursing, immorals, everything. It makes us a new creature, a new creature out of you. I who were once dead in sin and trespasses. Nevertheless, I, not me, but Christ lives in me. I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus. Amen. Heir to the promise. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. That land belongs to us. How do you know it? Joshua rose from the dead, brought back the evidence, the Holy Ghost, and I got it. Amen. Glory. I'm an heir. Oh, a child of the king, a child of the king, heir to all things. The Bible said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we we ministered on the evidence of salvation, you know, the evidence, it's the proof, you know, I it's the Holy Ghost and how we are a possessor of all things. Uh we have been given a a promise. And you know, I was just thinking about the evidence and and and how the Lord would maybe lead in this service and you know, what we would minister on and and you know, he he said he brought back the evidence and the evidence is the Holy Ghost. And now the the Holy Ghost is in us. And and I was just even thinking about that, you know, that time there that those men went looking for the Welsh revival. They were maybe looking for some movement. They were looking for some gathering. and and and when they and when they saw uh uh that that officer there, you know, twirling the baton and directing traffic or whatnot, they came over there and asked him, they said, \"Sir, we want to see if you can help us, but but we're looking for something. We're looking for the Welsh revival.\" And he said, \"You're I am the Welsh revival. You're looking at it.\" And and what's on my heart to minister to to you this morning is is I am the evidence. &gt;&gt; I am the proof of his resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And by the help of God, we'll just move along these lines as the as we just went through some thoughts how, you know, Christ is the word and the spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word and makes it alive. And and we ministered last night how an evil spirit will will will a spooky spirit will will raise up and just how Joshua and Caleb I they went over into the the the land of Israel and they came back with the very evidence and the fruit that it was everything that God said it was and they said, \"Let us go up at once.\" I mean, we are more than able. I I mean, it it's amazing to me what how how a believer looks at the promise and looks at the obstacle than than a skeptic or an unbeliever or a doubter because they were over there walking through the land and going, \"Oh my goodness, uh we can't take this and it's too much and my you know that maybe the food is good here, but I tell you what, we ain't got a chance.\" And Joshua and Caleb, they're walking around and and looking at the biggest giants of the land and going, \"Yep, we are more than able to do it.\" I tell you what, this is going to be a cakewalk because the same God that brought us out of Egypt, the same God that's been leading us through the wilderness, he's the same God that brought us through the Red Sea, he's the same God that's going to take us into the promised land. And he'll be the same God that'll annihilate and destroy all of our enemies. And because God gave us the promise, there is nothing that can stop us from going into our inheritance. I tell you, why not? Let's just go up at once. Let's take it all. Give me my mountain. There ain't no devil. There ain't no darkness. There ain't no demon that can stop me. We are well more able to take the land. Let us go up at once. [applause] And they got back over and Joshua and Caleb, they were all enthused about the evidence and they came here presented and say it's everything that God said it would be. Oh my, it just strikes me now. I want to tell you this message of the hour is everything that God said it was. It's my joy. It's my peace. It's my deliverance. It's my salvation. It's my reward. It's my glory. It's my all and all. It's everything that I ever wanted. And it's everything that I ever needed. It's more than enough. I want to say the message is more than enough. It'll save you. It'll deliver you. It'll fill you. It'll give you the joy. It'll give you the victory. It'll give you the peace. It'll take you to a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever forever. I tell you what, what a promise. What an inheritance that we have. I say we got something to be excited about. [applause] &gt;&gt; They come back excited and they come back enthused. &gt;&gt; We got the evidence &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden an evil report rose up. &gt;&gt; Well, wait a second, guys. How I mean, were we not in the same place? &gt;&gt; I mean, Lady Oia is a dark and wicked age. &gt;&gt; I mean, have you not seen the giants in the land and the lush devils and and all these these demons that were fighting that over there? There ain't no way we can take that land. There's no way a young person could live an overcoming life in Lady Osia. There's no way they can overcome all the strip teases and all the lust devils that walk around. There ain't no way we can go over there and take the land. And I tell you what, how in the world would we ever go into a body change? How in the world are we ever going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of the eye? See, they brought up all that doubt and all that wonder. But you know, Joshua and Caleb were over there saying, \"He's more than able to do it.\" Why? Because the same pillar of fire that brought us up out of Egypt. The same pillar of fire that led us through the wilderness. The same pillar of fire is the one that bringing us into the promised land. I want to tell you, it's the same pillar of fire that was with brother Brandham. is the same pillar of fire that is right here in the building right here this morning. He will give you the promise. He will take you into the land. He will help you defeat every devil and every demon. I don't care what it is, young people, that you're fighting. There's an anointing upon the word of the hour to bring you into the manifestation and the fulfilling of every single promise of God. You don't have to worry. You don't have to fear. You just got to say that God promised it and I'm more [screaming] than a conqueror through Jesus Christ that strengthens me. Hey, let us go up at once and take the land. There ain't no devil. There ain't no sickness. There ain't no trial that can stop me from walking into my divine promise of almighty God. It's a good land. The message is a good land. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. An evil report rose up. &gt;&gt; No, you can't do it. You You You can't take the land. But my prophet said he rose from the dead and brought back the evidence, the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And I got it. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I'm already feeling pretty good because I know what I had when I was out in the world. And it wasn't much. I had a bunch of fear. I had a bunch of anxiety. I had a bunch of bondage. I had a bunch of weight. I had a taskmaster that told me, \"Go here, do this, bow here, smoke that, drink that.\" But one day, I called on the name of the Lord and I got saved and I got filled with the Holy Ghost. And I'm here to tell you, I'm standing in 2025. I got the Holy Ghost. I got it. Is there are people here this morning that can say, \"I got the evidence. I'm the proof of his resurrection. I got the Holy Ghost. I got the message of the hour. I'm living it. I'm breathing it. I'm walking in it. I'm loving it. I got it. [screaming] Hallelujah. Is there a young people that can raise up in this generation of 2025 and say, \"I got it.\" Or are you still listening to that spooky spirit? &gt;&gt; No. No, you ain't got it. No. &gt;&gt; No. No, you ain't got it. &gt;&gt; No, that was just that was just emotion. &gt;&gt; That was just a workup, &gt;&gt; you know. That was just you were just getting excited because you're friends. [sighs] What? That's what chapter is that? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; What? What? What? Oh, that's that spooky spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the How do you know when the devil's lying? When he's running his mouth. &gt;&gt; I think sometimes it's a good time and maybe the only time that you can use that word and say, \"Shut up. &gt;&gt; Shut up, you old dun devil. I've done heard from my theophony. I know where I came from and I know where I am going. I done got the evidence of the Holy Ghost shut up in my bones. So quit running your mouth. Is there a young people here that you just want to go ahead and testify the devil's been lying to me. He's been telling me I ain't got the Holy Ghost. Been telling me I ain't going to go in the rapture. Telling me I the message ain't for me. And you just want to shout out this morning and say I got [screaming] it. I got the revelation. I got the Holy Ghost. I got the evidence. A matter of fact, I am [screaming] the evidence. [applause] &gt;&gt; I am the proof of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in a place he said, \"The spirit that's in you is the word made flesh in you.\" I want to just read this quote out of wisdom versus faith. Brother Brandham says, \"The Bible said, \"Not by power, not by might, but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord. Not by wisdom, not by knowledge, not by nomination, but with my spirit, I will what? Energize my word.\" &gt;&gt; The disciples had it swed into them. Then the spirit come to energize the word. See, not by power, not by might, not by wisdom, not by understanding. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord for that &gt;&gt; because I I really can't understand a lot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, not by that, but by my spirit, I will energize &gt;&gt; my word. Amen. &gt;&gt; By my spirit, say the Lord. It's the water of the word of faith that energizes the word of God and makes it work. So, I'm beginning to understand the promise isn't based on how I feel. The promise isn't based on what I can figure out. It It's not based on my ability. It's not even based on my good works. It's not based on something that I can do, but it's actually based on what he said. When God came to Abraham and he gave Abraham a promise and he said,\"Abraham, I will make you.\" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I will make you. &gt;&gt; He didn't ask Abraham, you know, uh, Abraham, do you think you can or or or would you would you do you think you can you can get good enough on your own? Or no, he come to him and he gave him a promise and said, Abraham, I will. &gt;&gt; And we know how the story goes. It was never based on Abraham's ability. It was always based on the promise. And it is no different because we are Abraham's seed. We are the the royal seed uh the elected of God. And it's not because of maybe what we can look at as our good works or our efforts. But it's always based upon the word. It's always based upon the promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet would say this in end time signed seed. He said when the word come to Mary, she never doubted it. She said, \"Behold the handmade of the Lord. Be it unto me according to thy word.\" See, she never said, \"Now, you wait till I feel life.\" &gt;&gt; And then I'll go testify. &gt;&gt; You wait till I'm positive. &gt;&gt; That's the way we so-called Christians do today. Wait till I'm positive. Wait till I begin to get better. and wait till I see something happen and then I'll do it. No sir, that's not the question. You believe first. &gt;&gt; So, we have been taught by a vindicated prophet that you can take God at his word and I want to tell you if something in your heart is believing and wanting the word. We heard brother Brandham said that is eternal life that's calling to you and he said you are an heir to that. And so if God is making a call upon your life, then you don't base it on how you're feeling. You don't base it on your circumstance. You say, \"That is the word of the Lord and I believe it.\" But many times when that happens, you know, the devil is always wanting to try to offer some type of emotion or some type of sensation and I'll just go launch right into it now because that's exactly what happened to me in in my conversion. And I got to a place, you know, where where uh uh you know, I needed help and and I I don't have time to go into all those things, but I I'd messed up my life pretty pretty bad and and I had an experience when I was 12 years old at at Louisiana camp, I knew God that was real, but but but I didn't feed that fire. I kept hanging out with the same kids in the neighborhood and and run around the neighborhood. And as they got older and started to do different things, you know, I I was around those influences and and and I held on for a while. And you know what? They actually even respected me and said, \"Oh, wow. You're a Christian. and you don't do this and you don't do that. Well, that's okay. We like Christians. Come on around, old buddy. You better watch out. Them friends you're hanging out with and oh, you're a Christian, mom. I'm being a light. You better watch out. You ain't got no business being on their grounds. [cheering] [applause] I held my testimony for a season. But you know what? Then I lost my reason. There's actually a quote on that. when you lose your reason, when you get between two opinions and and and for a while I I said, \"I didn't do this because of that. I'm a Christian. I don't I don't.\" And one day my friend said, \"Man, why don't you smoke?\" And I said, \"Well, it makes you cough.\" Wrong answer. I had lost my reason, Brother Donnie. I used to be. I'm a Christian. I don't go I don't watch movies because of this. I I don't get on them websites because of this. I don't do that because I'm a Christian. But somewhere along the line, I had been beguiled and I lost my reason of why I didn't do the things that I I wasn't supposed to be doing. And I gave the wrong answer. And when I gave the wrong answer, I didn't give a word answer. &gt;&gt; I said, \"It makes you cough.\" So guess what? Oh, just just a little. Just try a little. And and and right from that moment, I got pulled out into the world in a life of sin. I got myself into a lot of trouble. And I got to the place where I wanted the deliverance. And I remember making the decision in my heart and in my life that I'm never going to do these things again. I I really don't I I I well, I just go ahead and say it. I if if I didn't clean up my life, I was going to fail a drug test and I was going to go be in prison. &gt;&gt; That's just what it is. All right. And that's how Satan took me. And and I realized, man, if I don't clean up my life, I'm going to I'm going to fail these tests. And and I'm I started to think, man, I I need to clean up my act. I need to quit doing these things. And so I made a decision to quit doing those things. And and you want to know what? My decision didn't last long at all. &gt;&gt; There was some little old voice telling me, you got plenty of time. Just you got plenty of time. I tell you what, that same devil lives today. Don't give your heart to God Sunday morning. You just wait till Wednesday. Just wait till camp. Wait till your friends right here. Not this preacher. Not that preacher. Not brother D. Oh, there's always an excuse and a lying devil that wants you to put off the day of your salvation. But I want to tell you and declare to you, now is the time of salvation. Today is the salvation of the Lord. And I came to that moment and I had made the choice. I'm going to clean up my life. I'll never do these things anymore. I [laughter] I I I I can't risk ruining and throwing away my whole life. And I remember I made that decision and I came back in uh to the the you know, the officer that was going to test me for those things. And he said, \"Oh, I won't see you here uh for another test.\" and and and and 45 days. And right at that moment when he said that, it was something like something next to me was going, \"Hey, we got plenty of time. We we can do whatever we want to do.\" And in that moment, I realized that something else was making decisions for me. &gt;&gt; Ain't that strange? Something else was leading me. Something else was guiding me. Something else was pulling me into the lust and and telling me just one more time or just do that or just go down here. And I realized it was another nature. Actually, it was your first husband. uh uh the world that you're married to and you didn't realize that those thoughts that you've been having, that's the first nature of the devil that's leading you. Those ain't even your thoughts. And he told me, \"You got plenty of time on Matthew. It'll be okay.\" And in that moment, I realized whatever that was was not me. And whatever it is, it's bigger than me. And I said, \"God, I need your help.\" &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; So I left and and I got into my car and you know I had called on the name of the Lord. Feels good to do that. &gt;&gt; And I got to driving down down down down the road and all of a sudden I don't know why but this voice this thing said we'll just get emotional and cry &gt;&gt; and I was like what? &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, you've called on the name of the Lord. Now, just get emotional and cry. And I thought, get emotional and cry. And I thought, you know, I'd been raised, right? And I thought, well, it's not about getting emotional and crying. And then an old song came into my heart. I said, it's in the name of Jesus. I said, and I started singing that song. It's in the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus, we have the victory. And I started singing that song and and before you know it, I I didn't even realize that some guy pulled up next to me in what he thought was a fancy car. I thought maybe I had a fancy car and you know how ignorant people do. They pick fights with one another for no reason at all, you know. And he he pulled up beside me and and I I still my posture hadn't changed yet, you know. So I I'm I'm in there, you know, just kind of in my car and I look over there and I look at him, you know, and and all of a sudden he makes this big old face like this and goes and takes off and I'm like, \"Well, what in the world is he looking?\" I looked up in the mirror and before you know, I was crying and I was emotional. You know why? Because I put the word first. I I didn't I didn't say, \"Well, it's about my how emotional I get. It's about crying.\" But something in my heart rose up said, \"It's in the name of Jesus Christ that I had the victory.\" and oh then the spirit of God I I didn't realize it at the moment but he was moving upon my life but what was the what was the devil wanting to do? He was wanting to offer me some emotional &gt;&gt; as an evidence. &gt;&gt; But praise God, there was something in my heart. I needed more than an emotion. I needed more than just a shout. I needed more than just just just just some temporary moment. I needed something that could change my life. I needed the God of the Bible. I needed the God of Abraham. I needed the God of Isaac. I needed the God of Jacob. I needed the God of Paul and of John. I needed the God of William Brandom. I needed something to come down and energize my soul and change me. [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, and since we're here, I'll just keep going. So, you know, I I'm I now I am I now I am getting a little emotional and I am crying. &gt;&gt; But I I I this is just a journey. It's a start. And I'm still in the journey. I ain't trying to say anything about about that. But so I got home and I was excited. I had called on the name of the Lord and you know and I I' I I'd been out pretty hard in the world and and my brothers, they were serving the Lord and but it just so happened it was a Friday night of my dad's anniversary meetings and there was believers in town and and people were out at the restaurant and and and I didn't have any dealings, you know, uh as far as maybe a a wave. you and I remember crawling out my window to avoid having to see folks and and uh but now you know I've called on the name of the Lord and and I'm feeling good and you know now I want to I want to I want to be with believers you know and so I get home I want to know where my brothers are. I said mom I said where where's where's everybody at? She's like well they're they're at the restaurant. You know she's kind of confused like why do why why do you care? And I said okay thanks. And I went out and I got back in my vehicle and I was about to about to just head to the restaurant in that same voice. Isn't it strange this this same thought that would come with just one more time, just one more moment, or or just maybe I'll put it in ways you can understand. Not this service, not not this morning, &gt;&gt; not not today. Just just put it off one more time. Or no, you're okay. And I got back in that car and and and and I and I was just about to go and and and and I heard that thought say, \"I'll get you right back out in the world with music and TV.\" And in that moment, you know, I didn't realize, but I found out uh I found a quote for it because uh brother Brandham talks about Shamgar, I believe it is. And he said, you know, Shamgar got angry. The spirit of the Lord moved upon Shamgar and he got angry. And I didn't realize it in that moment when I heard that thought. He said, I'll get you back out in the world with music TV. I said, \"Get me. You're you're going to get me.\" And I jumped out of my car and I I ran into the garage and I was looking all around in there and I found a big old pair of bolt cutters. You know, these big old eagle claw wire clippers. You know, they're uh cutters. I don't know. They're maybe 3 4t long. And I and I I didn't even know what I was doing. I found those things and I grabbed them and I ran back in the house and I started coming through the kitchen and I said, \"I'm going to get you. You're not going to get me. I'll show you.\" And my mom goes, \"Matthew, wait.\" Remember, I just asked her where my brothers were. She thought somebody was about to get it. &gt;&gt; Well, she wasn't wrong. &gt;&gt; And I remember in that moment, I I I rounded up the stairs and I flung open my door and there was a big old TV sitting there and I took them big old bunk bolt cutters and I swung them and I hit that TV and that thing exploded and I screamed out, \"How you like me now? [applause] And in that moment, [applause] in that moment when I screamed out, \"How you like me now?\" There came something pouring out of heaven that came upon my life. Oh, and it changed the way that I thought. It changed the way that I wanted to dress. It changed my actions. It changed my thinking. My soul had become energized to be what I was always predestinated to be. And that was a son of God. I was heir to all the promises. I was heir to salvation. I'm heir to the resurrection. I was heir to all these things, but I was out there living in sin. I want to tell you if there's a young person here this morning or old alike, I say, you know what it does? Sometimes you just got to get mad at the devil and say, \"Devil, I'm sick and tired of you robbing me of my joy, robbing me of my peace. I'm going to get you this morning. I'm coming after you. Take the word of God, which is the sword of the spirit. Look that devil right in the face and say, \"I'm coming for you.\" And hit him with the word. If he don't move, hit him again. Hit him again. Hit him again. And then scream out, \"How you like me now? [screaming] [applause] Where's the next one?\" [applause] Hallelujah. I say there's an experience here for you this morning, &gt;&gt; but you got to believe first. Oh, that came after believing. &gt;&gt; See, my my first nature, &gt;&gt; you know, and I used to always give this testimony uh that, you know, for years I heard the devil say and I heard the devil say and I heard the devil say and then I heard a testimony one time uh given uh I can't verify but it seemed credible source that said it and and it meant a lot to me so I'll take it for myself. And he he was testifying how brother Brandham, I believe, was uh uh talking to um I always forget the brother. He mentions him as a prophet in South Africa. And he was he was he was speaking to him and he said he was talking about that that picture where it looks like the pillar of fire is kind of swirling up around the around the pulpit. And he he he said to him, he said, \"You see that uh uh brethren right behind there? You see that image? That's an old Indian chief.\" He said he says, \"That's my old nature.\" And he said, \"It's always back there trying to\" He said, \"See what happens?\" He says, \"When the Holy Spirit comes in, it burns that nature out of you. &gt;&gt; And that old nature goes out behind you and it's always looking for an opportunity to come back into the seat of authority.\" &gt;&gt; Something along those lines. And when I heard that, all of a sudden, it struck me and I realized what I was calling the devil all those times was actually my first nature. It was my first husband that I was born with. And I caught the revelation. Oh, that was that first nature. That's why in Romans 7, Paul is telling the church, look, as long as as a woman's husband is alive, she's subject under the law. Has to has to live under that. And he brings down the type. And he's showing the only way that she can be free from that bondage is that first husband has to die and then he's free. And that's why Paul said, \"Then you can be married to another. Then you can be married to Jesus Christ.\" Look, a lot of us are trying to hang on to the world and hang on to the word at the same time. But I want to tell you, you got to die. That first nature gots to die. You got to repent of your sins. You got to call out say, \"Oh, God, help me. I want deliverance from the things. I don't want to listen to country music. I don't want to listen to the radio. I don't want to dress this way. I don't want to act this way. I don't want to watch these things.\" You got to realize there's another nature, a fierce nature. And that nature gots to die. And you got to call upon the name of the Lord with all your heart. Say, \"Lord, I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I'm tired of the devil running me here and there and me never getting the victory and going through cycles of revival and death over and over from one camp to the next camp. I need to put a stake down. I need to be changed. I need to meet the pillar of fire and know that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And that first man's got to die. [applause] &gt;&gt; And die. It did. [gasps] &gt;&gt; But you know, [sighs] you still got this little bag of bones. But you know, you realize that I' I've been given a promise to bring it under subjection. [gasps] &gt;&gt; My promised land might not be some boundaries set out there with with with landscape stakes, but I've been given this land. &gt;&gt; This is the place that I can express the evidence. This is where I can prove that he's the same yesterday, today, and the forever. And the things that come out of this mouth can declare he is risen. And the footsteps that I can take can show he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And my attitude and my joy can can show that he is not dead. &gt;&gt; He is alive. &gt;&gt; Where is the Welsh revival? Where is the bride's revival? &gt;&gt; You're looking at it. &gt;&gt; I'm the proof. &gt;&gt; I'm the evidence. I once was dead, &gt;&gt; but I have been made alive in Jesus Christ. I've been set free from the things of the world. &gt;&gt; How, Matthew? Well, I I believed. &gt;&gt; But you know, you can't even believe unless it's given to you to believe. You realize how rigged this thing is? &gt;&gt; And and and and I don't mind saying it because brother Donnie, I I needed that. &gt;&gt; I needed it to be rigged. &gt;&gt; And so I know that I make mistakes. Sure. I I I go through hard times and I fall down and and I realize I I'm being built up into the stature of a perfect man and coming into that place of of perfect love and and working out of those things and I realize there's there's still some some things in this pest house that that God is working on and and sometimes, you know, things can rub you a certain way and you don't have the right response. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you, it starts first with taking God at his word. And I tell you what, we make salvation and we make the the baptism of the Holy Ghost complicated. &gt;&gt; It is not complicated. &gt;&gt; Are you tired of living the way you're living &gt;&gt; or I mean, if you're still enjoying it, look, I'll tell you this. This happened to me 6 months before my conversion. Because I tell you what, sin is a it's a it's a it's a hard taskmaster. I mean, them mud pits and them slaves that beat you in Egypt, I'm telling you what. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might enjoy it for a little while, but then you start to realize they'll start, you know, making you make bricks without straw. &gt;&gt; And you know that thing that used to get you high, it don't get you high anymore. &gt;&gt; And that thing you looked at that you like so much, it just don't do it for you anymore. &gt;&gt; And it ain't one movies, it's two movies. &gt;&gt; And it ain't 25 bucks an hour, it needs to be 30 bucks an hour. And it ain't 50 bucks an hour, it has to be 100. The things of the world, they'll never satisfy. never never never never never never never never satisfy &gt;&gt; the hunger and thirst of a true son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; But, you know, I got tired of of you know, living under that. And so I'll never forget I jumped out I I I was driving down the road and and I jumped out of my my my car and I ran down and I got in a ditch and and I I started talking to the Lord and and it's kind of funny looking back on it because I was tired of the bondage but I kind of still, you know, like doing it. &gt;&gt; But there came a day &gt;&gt; I was just tired of it all. I didn't want to do any of that stuff anymore. I &gt;&gt; I actually realized what it was doing to my life and how Satan was trying to rob me and I hated it. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. If if you're there, &gt;&gt; if you if it's in your heart and you keep want to run out with the things of the world, &gt;&gt; it'll be there for you. &gt;&gt; But I say if something in your heart say, you know what, that's right. It's such a late hour. I don't need to fool around. you start entertaining things of the world, it'll take you way further than you want to go. &gt;&gt; And I remember praying there and and uh you know, but I I I remember in my heart, you know, I I didn't I didn't really I didn't really want to give up those things. So, I'm fast forwarding and showing you that when that first initial cry of my heart came and I really meant business, but I just remember in my heart it was just calling upon the name of the Lord and you shall be saved. It first comes by believing. And and I was just in this as we as I it struck me, you know, that's the same thing that happened with John Ryan. You know, he come through the the the prayer line and and and he said, you know, God bless you. You're healed. And he went through and he said he come back through and said, I thought you said I was healed. He said, I thought you said you believed. &gt;&gt; I thought you said I had the Holy Ghost. I thought you said you had it. &gt;&gt; What are you doing with it? &gt;&gt; Are you waiting for a feeling? Are you waiting for I don't know why we're here, but we're here. Or are you looking by faith into the word of God and saying, \"God, you said if I repent of my sins and I'm baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I shall get the gift of the Holy Ghost.\" You know what brother Brandham told John Ryan? He said, \"If you believe it, then go out there and testify. Go into action.\" And you know what he did? He really believed. So he started going around town saying, \"I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm healed.\" And he actually had a testimony to go along with his faith. And you know the rest of the story that happened. He's sitting in that old barber chair and here they were making fun of him. and he went to testify. And once again, hey, God's healed me. And then his eyes come open. I want to tell you young people, if God give you a promise and you say, I got the Holy Ghost, don't let that old devil rob you of the Holy Ghost. You go feel free to testify, I've repented of my sins. I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and God give me the Holy Ghost. And if you've made a mistake or you've made a failure, get right back up and say, I plead the blood of Jesus Christ. God, give me the promise of the Holy Ghost. If I didn't overcome this time, I'll overcome the next time because God has given me a promise. And I'm heir to every single promise. And I got the faith to believe it. And there ain't no devil or spooky spirit that's going to rob me and take me away from my joy and my victory. Come on, people. Come on, young people. You got to testify about it. Brother Brandham goes on. He says, \"What what just in this this quote that we're reading, you got to believe first.\" Well, we just ask for the Lord to help us here. He said, 'What did Elijah tell the woman that he went to with nothing but a handful of milk? He said, 'Make me a cake first. The miracle will happen after you take God's word first. You begin to believe God's word and then the miracle takes place upon the word &gt;&gt; because the word is the seed that brings forth the miracle. Go to take the word first. The Holy Spirit gives it life like water falling from heaven. Jesus said the he said it is the spirit that quickenth the flesh that profitth you nothing. The words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life. He said in one place the seed word itself is what? The holy spirit energizes. &gt;&gt; Now I like that because when you think about something that's energized when something's energized it's stimulated. It's awakened. It's quickened. It's electrified. &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever been electrified? &gt;&gt; I want to tell you it's a revelation. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you when you get shocked and you get the revelation of of voltage, I want to tell you that type of revelation, you can't stand still. &gt;&gt; You're going to move. &gt;&gt; You're going to shout. You're going to do something. You're going to be do something like this. You're going to what? Wow. [screaming] Whoa. Wow. Good. Go. Woo. That that got some that got some electricity into it. I want to tell you that's the same thing with the message of the hour. When you get a revelation, look, it will move you. You can't stand still. You're going to shout. You're going to tell somebody. Somebody's going to look over you and say, say, \"Hey, why you acting like that? Hey, I've been electrified. I've been awakened. I've been stimulated. I got revelation.\" It'll put you into action. [applause] &gt;&gt; It's just like a seed with all the potential. It's just laying there, but it just needs to be energized. It just needs to be awakened. You know, it just reminds me as brother Brandon talks about how they everybody's saying, \"Hunger, fast, pray, hunger, fast, pray.\" He said, \"What are they doing?\" He said, \"They've missed the awakening of the bride.\" But God has sent a message by a vindicated prophet according to Malachi 4:5 and Luke 17:30. There has been a message that has come forth and the breaking of those seals to awaken the bride of Jesus Christ to all the potential that the word says that you are. Brother Brandham says it takes the spirit of God to bring life out of broken sisters. And the life must not come out of just an intellectual revival. It has to come out of the Bible, a word revival. And what that that word is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And when it falls today, and quickened, you get the same results you did in Acts 2. Exactly. It always had, it always will be because it's the spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere. It takes the spirit. It takes atmosphere to do things. That's the reason you men are always taught to bring your children here. &gt;&gt; Here, &gt;&gt; here. &gt;&gt; Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together. Right? &gt;&gt; Because when we come together, there's an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; When we come together, we bring the licks of fire. When we come together, we know there's the pillar of fire. We know the angel of the Lord is here. He's present amongst us and we're taught to bring our kids here. Why? Because when we come together, there's an atmosphere and it takes atmosphere to do things. I pray there'd be such an atmosphere created here this morning. There'd be such an expectation. There be be people who are sick and tired of their task masters. There's people that want to get born again. There's people that want to get filled with the Holy Ghost. There's such an atmosphere fear here for salvation, an atmosphere here for uh for for healing. I tell you what, there could be an atmosphere created here that faith can rise up to believe all things. I want to tell you right now, this morning, we are se seated in the realms where all things are possible to them that believe right here in this atmosphere this morning in this church. The supernatural can take place. &gt;&gt; Why? because an atmosphere you know the prophet of God said down in your soul is a predestinated seed which is eternal life. &gt;&gt; It was always there &gt;&gt; and all the father has given me will come. &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; All the father has given me will come. That means you're not going to just come halfway. &gt;&gt; You're not going to only come part of the way. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to come all the way because he said you're going to come all the way. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to maybe just move into some very familiar things. And maybe if we just need to act like we've never heard it before, &gt;&gt; but we've allowed things to become common to us. &gt;&gt; And and just what was on my heart is talking about the evidence of salvation and how a spooky spirit tries tries to to to rob you of it. My my heart for you young people I is is yes. Yes yes yes you are the bride of Jesus Christ. Yes, God has given you a promise and yes, God has promised you the Holy Ghost and and and maybe you're in a stage of justification or sanctification and you're believing for the the Holy Ghost. But I want to tell you I in in all of those stages, it's all the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's the word. It's the spirit. &gt;&gt; It's all a work of God in your life. And when God starts to move into your life, if if we start to doubt the word and doubt our experience and doubt our weapon, then the devil can corner you and he can start to discourage you and he can and you know what you instead of you going forward all a sudden you stop. And I can't tell you countless uh uh young people that that will come and and I'm not discouraging you to do that. You do that. I we we want to pray with you. We want you to come. You show who side that you're on. And many times they come for prayer and and what's on their heart is like I don't know if I got the Holy Ghost. I I you know I I might I want to tell you young people I I've come to the same conclusion after serving God for 101 15 years and knowing I got the Holy Ghost and knowing I've been changed and then I make some bad decision and do some things I shouldn't do and then I look into the word I'm like &gt;&gt; and then the prophet preach a message in such a way and I'm like man I brother Donnie I don't even know if I got it. Right? &gt;&gt; I mean, my goodness gracious, this is, &gt;&gt; wow, how could I ever be that? &gt;&gt; And then I go, &gt;&gt; okay, well, what what what happens if I don't got it? &gt;&gt; I mean, am I going to go back to the world? &gt;&gt; Brother Donnie, you know what? I realized I couldn't live it, so I'm just going to go down the Baptist church. &gt;&gt; Hey, what's your options? &gt;&gt; Like, really? &gt;&gt; What's your options? The problem is is we want the devil &gt;&gt; to give us options. &gt;&gt; Okay. What happens if I ain't got the Holy Ghost? Well, &gt;&gt; I'm going to repent of my sins. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say, Lord, you started the work. &gt;&gt; And you'll finish that work. &gt;&gt; And you said, if I repent of my sins and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And God is not a man that he shall lie. and Lord, if you never do another thing for me, you've already done enough for me. And then I start kind of feeling pretty good. And I realize, you know what? I maybe I messed up. But my Bible tells me my name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world. So whether I got it now or whether I get it tomorrow or whether I had it yesterday, it really don't matter because this thing is rigged. I am going in a rapture. I got a promise of the Holy Ghost. I got a promise of victory. Hallelujah. That old devil, you old spooky spirit trying to rob these young people of the evidence of salvation, of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Somebody here ought to just get mad and say, \"You old devil. You old spooky spirit. You've lied to me long enough. How you like me now? I got it. I got it. I got the evidence. Shut up in my bones. Glory. [applause] Now you can start walking &gt;&gt; because as soon as you listen to something that's not in the word, it stops your progress. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe I You know what? What? What's Nelly? Remember Nelly had a real experience? &gt;&gt; You know, she's walking down the road and all a sudden, oh, you know, &gt;&gt; high school prom, dance, friends, neighbor. &gt;&gt; Nowadays, it's all on your phone, Instagram, old friend went to school with. I'll see how they're doing. I'll like their profile. I'll just see what it's all about. I'll just stop for a moment. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, you're pulled into some atmosphere. You're pulled into some temptation. And all of a sudden, you're in the arms of another man. And she came to herself. And I tell you what, people want to condemn Nelly Nelly Sanders. But you know what? She knew where to go. &gt;&gt; She didn't run down to the Baptist church. She didn't run down to this. You know, she said, \"I'm going to go to the prophet of God. She ran on down to the prophet and said, \"Oh, brother Brandon, brother Brandon, Brother Brandon, I messed up. I really made a mistake. I really messed up now. I've ruined it.\" Prophet took her. And he started to pray for her. And he started to rebuke that spirit. And you know what he said? He said, \"You old Satan, you old devil. She didn't mean to do it. Hey young people, a lot of you didn't mean to do it. You were trapped into it when you showed up here. You didn't mean to give into those lust devils and all those things. There was just a nature hanging on you. You didn't mean to do it. But a vindicated prophet said, \"Satan, you take your hands off of her. I claim her for the glory of Almighty God. And I will stand here this morning. I will claim every young person, every daughter and son of God for the glory of Almighty.\" Satan, you take your hands off these young people. They are free to serve God with all of their heart, with all of their life, with all of their soul. They've been pro promised the baptism of the Holy Ghost. They can put every devil, every demon, every suicide, every complex under their feet. Why? They've been predestinated to do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, what about it, church? &gt;&gt; In an atmosphere like this, &gt;&gt; all things are possible. to them that believe. &gt;&gt; Why wait any longer? &gt;&gt; We're more than able. &gt;&gt; I want to bring some evidence. [gasps] We listen to the devil so much. We listen to some spooky spirits and we've been ministering about the evidence of salvation, the Holy Ghost, and how Satan's always wanting to rob you of that. But what do you have to do first? You got to believe. &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. The real invisible union, the real genuine eagles here. My sheep know my voice. A stranger they won't follow. Why? It was put in there by predestination. You were for ordained to be a son of God. &gt;&gt; You were in God before the foundation of the world. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I can still get excited. &gt;&gt; I can I can't even comprehend that, but I believe it. &gt;&gt; Call me a nut. Call me a lunatic. Call me a fanatic. I believe it. Something in here is more real than my five senses. It's more real than my emotions. It's more real than all of the other things. There's another uh sense, the sixth sense of faith that when I hear that, oh, glory to God, that's my reality. [applause] &gt;&gt; All right, all the young people in here, raise your hand. I mean, if the change is on, it's going the wrong direction. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I know time's speeding up, but come on. You walked in at 15 and now you're 50. &gt;&gt; Come on, all you young people, raise your hands. &gt;&gt; If you're 30 and under, raise your hand. We got some that are over and they're already claiming their promise. Glory, I haven't lost one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Listen, God is speaking to you and and we we could go into it, but we take for granted that we live under the revelation of Malachi 4:5. &gt;&gt; I can't express enough of how privileged we are &gt;&gt; to hear a vindicated prophet. not not a gift of prophecy, &gt;&gt; but a very mouthpiece piece of God &gt;&gt; to tell you his thoughts of you. &gt;&gt; This is God's mind to you young people. &gt;&gt; And I want you to believe it &gt;&gt; because when we catch a revelation of these things, it it doesn't matter what comes or goes. You have an anchor. You have an absolute. &gt;&gt; And you're not subject to to trends and fashions and emotions. Yes, we're going to have hurt feelings. We're going to have broken hearts. There's a lot of things on this side that mold our character. You know, Brother Brandham said you, you know, it's it is joy. It is wonderful. But, you know, it's it's also a way of agony and suffering. So, we're not taking away from those things. You're going to have to go through hard times and through journey. But when you have a revelation in your soul to know God's thoughts towards you, it's the victory. &gt;&gt; All right, so some familiar things. We got some young people here. We'll try to move quickly. It is Sunday. We only got one service. &gt;&gt; Thank you. That's all right, brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; You were fore orained to a son of God. You were in God before the foundation of the world. You're only manifested in this day for his honor and glory. How can you do it without honoring his word and stand with every word of God? Yes, sir. Which you are a part of that word by predestination. Because look, the God God is the word. You believe it? &gt;&gt; Well, if he always was the word, in the beginning was the word and the word was with God, then you were in God. the word. The part that you're to play was in God before the foundation of the world. He seen you. He knew you. He predestinated you to it. &gt;&gt; The part that you're to play. &gt;&gt; You are actually playing out a part &gt;&gt; that was predestinated in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; He knew your stature. He knew how tall. He knew how short. He knew how wide. And I want to tell you, we might laugh and chuckle at those things, but Satan does a lot of damage with the characteristics. Look, I should have given up a long time ago with a nose this big, &gt;&gt; but God knew how I would show up. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we got to embrace that part of the revelation, too. &gt;&gt; Come on. Because we'll battle complexes, &gt;&gt; generational curses. Why does my family have to be this way? Why is this all God knew exactly how you would show up? Look, look, when you do a play, you pick people to fit the part, &gt;&gt; right? So, something was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. He knew, I'm going to pick you. I'm going to pick you. I'm going to pick you. You're exactly what I want to be in the end time. and Lady Oia to prove to the God of the evil age. You might have come into my Eden in the beginning, but I sent my pride into Satan's Eden and she's going to tear your kingdom down. He knew the way you would show up. He knew how tall. He knew how short you would be. He knew the generational curses. He knew the things that you would struggle. But he predestinated you. He wrote your name on the Lamb's book of life. And he said, \"Here she is, right on time, right on quue. Play your part, church. [cheering] Play your part. Play it with all [screaming] of your heart. With everything that's in you, play your part. [applause] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes when churches do plays, you know, they pick different people to do parts. &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; You know, I remember we did a church play one time and [sighs] we had a brother in our church named Brother Towanda. And I don't know how he got the part, but he got to be a palm tree. And you know, I'm kind of glad I didn't get that part. But some people want that part. Some people want the part behind the curtains. &gt;&gt; I'll do the sound. I'll I'll sew the things together, but I ain't getting out on that stage. But whatever part you're predestinated to play and you know, I I got I got to thinking about that when I read that quote. It said, \"The part you play.\" I started thinking about church plays. And I remember thinking about a play that was done at Louisiana camp maybe some 25 years ago or something like that. And I got the image in my head because, you know, they they picked Brother Eli Arbagast. If any of you know your big old tall brother, you know, we always knew who was playing Goliath. it was brother Eli, you know, so they picked him and then they picked some brothers, you know, to be David and and I was laughing about that and then it reminded me here not too long ago. I was having some fellowship with brother Matt Morris and and somehow that came up and he goes, \"You know what?\" He goes, \"I was the rock and I got to and I was in my study and I got to think about I started laughing it and I sent brother Matt I sent brother Matt the the the text. said, \"Man, I got to think in that play about and about, you know, about how how Goliath had to play his part and and and and you know, David had to play his part and how you played the rock.\" And he text me back and said, \"Somebody had to do it.\" I tell you what, I actually got a noise complaint from the office downstairs because I realized, \"Hey, somebody got to play the part. If I'm going to be the rock, I don't care what it is. Let me be a rock in his hand. Go ahead and put me in your sling, Lord. Throw me at every giant, every devil. I'll knock them out. I'll knock them down. As long as I'm on your hand. I don't care what part I play. As long as it's the part that the Lord Jesus wants me to play. &gt;&gt; Play your part, church. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; You don't get all dressed up and memorize your lines and rehearse everything and then it comes time for your part. &gt;&gt; Oh no. We all go through it. I'm going to forget my lines. How many have ever got up to sing a song special and my goodness, your mind just goes blank. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we feel like that. We've we've gone to church. We've we've had the experience and everything and then in the moment or whatnot. Don't worry. He said, \"I'll be with you even in you. The conductors right there. If you lose your lines here, here's the sheet music. &gt;&gt; I got the sheet music right here. &gt;&gt; If you forgot, just get back. Turn on a tape. &gt;&gt; If you forget, get into your Bible. If you forget, get into prayer. He's right there. &gt;&gt; Good time. &gt;&gt; Look, dress rehearsal's over. &gt;&gt; Time of playing games is over. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; This is time to go home. &gt;&gt; I mean, we we are right on the cusp. Even brother Donnie shared this morning. And I think right now uh the pope made some allegiance with with with you know the ecumenical council. Everything's tightening up. It's all coming together. Look, Satan's getting his superman and the world and all the ecumenical councils and everything's you what it's a uniting time and sign. The world's uniting. Christianity is re uniting. Everything out there's uniting. The devil's reuniting. Everything's uniting. But oh, glory to God. There is a bride and she is uniting under the headship of the word, the Lord Jesus Christ. And what are we uniting with? We're uniting with the word. [screaming] What are we uniting for? The rapture. [applause] Oh, hallelujah. It's time to play your part. &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking about that. Here stoods David. You know, David had to play his part. And here's Goliath standing there making his boast. We'll try to just bring this towards a close by the help of God somehow. So, here's here's Goliath. He's making his boast. And to think that the armies of the living God, they they had forgot who they were. They were letting their own enemy, the the the the the devil, just stand there and defy the armies of the living God. But I love what the prophet of God said. He said, you know, his boast happen to fall on the wrong ears. &gt;&gt; Come on, young people. It's time to quit listening to that boast. And when he starts talking to do something about it, &gt;&gt; oh yeah, you're going to get me. I'm going to get you. &gt;&gt; And you take the sword of the word. So here them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them that challenge came upon David's ears but you know what David was predestinated to meet the challenge &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; David had the victory before he even showed up &gt;&gt; what about you &gt;&gt; before you even showed up in Lady Oia the playwright was already written Your part was already chosen. It was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world world. You just showed up to manifest your part. And you are the victorious bride of Jesus Christ. There ain't no Goliath. There ain't no devil that can stop you. You already had the victory when you showed up. Look, that's what the prophet of God said about David. He already had the victory when he got there. So, he didn't come into the battle hanging his head. He come into that battle dancing and swinging that sling. He said, \"You come into and defy the name of the Lord with your gods and the Philistine armies, but I come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.\" He went dancing right into that battle and he had that rock of faith and he slung that right out and knocked that devil down. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I said, \"What about you?\" The prophet of God said this, he knowed where he was at. Hallelujah. Everyone sitting here, you're person you, everyone sitting here tonight, you're positionally in Christ. God has confirmed it. election, calling, anointing, placing. &gt;&gt; He elected you and called you. He elected you and called you. &gt;&gt; Then he anointed you with the Holy Spirit. And now he's placed you in the body of Christ. Each one of you is David's. &gt;&gt; Where's the Goliath? Who's the Goliath, Brother Brandham? That cancer that's eating you up. That tumor that's hanging on you, them cataracts on your eyes, that crippled arm, every little thing looks at it and says it can't be done. The devil says you might as well quit believing. You might as well settle down because you never can no more get well. Your doctor said so. All of the rest of them said so. You can't get well. But the Christ that made you stop your drinking, your smoking, your lying, and stealing that saved you from a life of drunkenness, from riing, from a sin and a devil's grave is if God can do that for you, he can save you from your TV. He can save you from your cancer. He's the Goliath. Don't take his boast. Stand in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and challenge him to a showdown. Amen. I feel religious positionally. You are in Christ. If the believer knowed his position, he'd have it. God's great spirit is here. And his Holy Ghost is ready to fall on anybody that will believe. Do you believe? Do you believe? Hey church, play your part. You're anointed for the job. Hallelujah. [applause] Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. &gt;&gt; I'm a winner and you're a loser. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. &gt;&gt; I'm going to heaven and you're going to hell. Boo devil. &gt;&gt; Facts. &gt;&gt; Facts. predetermined. &gt;&gt; I'm just playing my part. &gt;&gt; So, don't mind me. &gt;&gt; I'm just happy about the part God gave me to play. &gt;&gt; He didn't call me to be a palm tree. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He didn't call me to be a sinner. &gt;&gt; He didn't call me to be a drunk. He didn't call you to be in bondage. He didn't call you to lust after those last devils. He called you to be an overcoming son and daughter of God to put every devil and every disease and every sickness under your feet. I say, \"Boo devil. I'm going to play my part and I'm going to believe [screaming] with all of my heart. I'm not basing it upon what I see. I'm not basing upon the past and I'm not basing on the future. I'm basing it on what he said. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; For my Bible tells me in Romans 8:28, \"And we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose, for whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, &gt;&gt; whom he did predestinate then he also called. Is anybody hearing the call of God? &gt;&gt; May maybe maybe you you maybe right now you feel like you don't got the Holy Ghost and there's no hope for you. But do you feel God pulling upon your heart? &gt;&gt; You feel the call of God on your life. Listen to this. This is powerful. &gt;&gt; This right here will give you victory. &gt;&gt; You can whoop the devil with this. &gt;&gt; Come on. Have we forgot &gt;&gt; how powerful this thing is? &gt;&gt; It's so powerful. When our Lord was here, &gt;&gt; he used it &gt;&gt; to whip the devil. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, I come from the same material. &gt;&gt; So then I'll just take the same old Bible, &gt;&gt; same word. God's called you. If there's a call of God upon your life, &gt;&gt; them he's also called. Them he's also justified. And them he's also Them he's also justified. Them he's also glorified. &gt;&gt; I told you it's rigged. &gt;&gt; David picking up out of Why Christ speak. David would say, \"The God that delivered me from the lion, the God that delivered me from the paws of that bear, he'll more than deliver me from that Philistine.\" Now, put whatever it is you're battling right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The God that justified me, the God that called me, he's the God that'll fill me with the Holy Ghost, he'll deliver me from that problem, here I come. I meet you in the name of the Lord, God of Israel. Amen. He prophet of God said he didn't pray through. He was already prayed through. God prayed him through before the foundation of the world. He was anointed for the job. He just had to speak and go forward. Glory to God. Hey, I might have messed up and forgot to pray this morning. But praise the name of the living God. He already prayed me through before the foundation of the world. So maybe I didn't dot all my eyes and cross all my tees and I walked into a problem and maybe I didn't get prayed up and I wasn't listening to tape. But you know what? It doesn't change that I'm a son of God. I can look that devil right in the face and say, \"You know what? I made a misstep. I made a mistake. But Jesus Christ prayed me through before the foundation of the world. And I'll still whip you, devil [applause] &gt;&gt; because the word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said it's here and stronger I and greater than it ever was in the true word bride. &gt;&gt; He said hold on to that word. Fill your heart and your mouth with it. Just going to work towards a close quickly. We got to do weapons. We got to fight with this. &gt;&gt; Some some of the some of the greatest scriptures uh that have done me the most good is my Bible tells me there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So then we allow condemnation and we allow those things to paralyze us. &gt;&gt; I I I did it again. I &gt;&gt; I did it again. I I feel like I can't even sing. Second, you know what? All have sinned and come short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; And if you made a mistake, then we need more of God to overcome it the next time. &gt;&gt; You repent and you get up and that feeling. Now, there's a difference between conviction and condemnation. &gt;&gt; And the devil's pretty sly. He'll try to make you mix up the two. &gt;&gt; Conviction will lead you to repentance. &gt;&gt; Condemnation will hold you in sin. Yes, sir, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You fall to a temptation, I just, you know, I'll make it right later. No, be quick to repent. &gt;&gt; Be zealous to repent. That's the That's what should be for the age. &gt;&gt; Brother Random said the the the zealous to say, I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; Somehow that went out of the maybe went out of some of the churches a long time ago. They they &gt;&gt; I'm right. Everybody else is wrong. Some people, they're so right. No, we we need to be quick to repent, &gt;&gt; you know, and if you feel something condemning you and and it's it's keeping you from the promises of God, it's keeping you from wanting to pray. It's keeping you from wanting to re, you know, you know, you're like, what what is it? But but conviction should say, oh God, I'm so sorry. It should drive you to your knees in repentance. &gt;&gt; There's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. Blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin. Oh my, those are promises that bring you through hard times and trials as you're growing in the stature of a perfect man. And brother Bandham said this in the invisible union. He said, \"He, the bridegroom, took away your shame.\" &gt;&gt; Just a few more moments. And put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life. That's what the Bible said. &gt;&gt; Your first husband that you were married to the world, &gt;&gt; right? We don't have to go into that. We We got a picture, right? &gt;&gt; Young people, are you seeing that first nature that's been warning against you? &gt;&gt; Can you see it better now? &gt;&gt; Why Paul said you got to be married to another? That first husband that you were married to, the world, the anointed bridegroom, which for ordained you, has washed you by the washing of the water, by the church, &gt;&gt; by your good works, &gt;&gt; by your impeccable standing and your impeccable attendance to Word of Life Church. by your knowledge of the message. &gt;&gt; By how many tapes you've memorized, &gt;&gt; by how well you've been able to study out and explain the Bible. &gt;&gt; Oh, are the signs and wonders that you've performed or how powerful your gift is. &gt;&gt; No, that that no, that don't sound right. &gt;&gt; Remember, we already went through that on Friday. Salvation is of the Lord. It's not salvation plus your good works. &gt;&gt; It's not Christ plus. It's Christ alone. From start to finish, salvation is of the Lord. &gt;&gt; No, that that don't sound right, does it? You might find that in the Almanac, but it's not in God's Bible. By the washing of the water, by the word. In the word. And I want to tell you that's why God sent a vindicated prophet to restore the word and to restore the faith back to the original word. &gt;&gt; Because without the opening of the seals, it's a closed book. &gt;&gt; And it's the very revelation of the age, the word of our age that's washing you. &gt;&gt; Is that all right, brother Donnie? &gt;&gt; You You can't find it any other place. So listen now. He says, \"You are standing completely justified.\" That's right. &gt;&gt; As though you never did it at the beginning. Now I just asked the musicians to come to help me bring this towards a close. [snorts] I I I enjoyed that song, I've been changed. I believe it's even in the lyrics says no more shame. But think about this. I say, \"What a what what a message. What a word.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That could take a sinner. &gt;&gt; And pluck them out of the muck and mire and not only wash them up and and cleanse them up, but by the revelation of it, not a partial revelation under Luther. No, this is the full revelation of justification, &gt;&gt; which means you never did it in the first place. That ought to set somebody free here this morning. &gt;&gt; The devil's been trying to make you feel guilty. He's been trying to put condemnation on you. Maybe you feel like you lost your virtue and no one's ever going to love you right and you'll never be able to uh uh fit. And the devil's trying to rub your nose and all of your past and all your failures and all your mistakes. But if you're hearing the call of God, God is God is calling to you. And right now by the full revelation of justification, a vindicated prophet is telling you that you are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. Every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word stands as though you never sinned at the first place. You are perfect. Oh, praise the wonderful name of the living God. It doesn't matter about my past. It doesn't matter about my sin. It doesn't matter about what that spooky spirit has tried to tell me. God has syndicate a vindicated word, a vindicated message to tell me you are perfect. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in perfect faith said then the only thing you have to do is believe what you are. &gt;&gt; Have faith in what you are. &gt;&gt; Have faith in what the word says you are. Play your part. &gt;&gt; Have faith in what the word says you are. &gt;&gt; You are standing completely justified as though you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Now, just picking this up out of Christ, the mystery of God revealed. Justified in his sight. Why are we justified? We are his victory. &gt;&gt; I'm the proof. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm the evidence &gt;&gt; justified. Why are why are we justified? We are his victory. The church is his victory. We come forth in the last days with the glorious gospel showing his victory. He died for this purpose. And we are proof of his victory. Amen. And when we see him coming down and living among the church, that's his victories shows that they couldn't keep him in the grave. Neither can they keep us. That's right. We're bound, right? And we're already potentially arised because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominations and creeds to an eternal word of the eternal God which is himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday, today and forever. [screaming] You are his victory. You are the proof of his resurrection. You are the very proof of the message of the hour. Where is the Welsh revival? Where is the bride revival? I am the bride. Where is the message of the hour? I am the message of the hour. I am the proof of Malachi 4:5. I am the proof of Revelations 10 1-7. Why? Because I'm the very spoken word that has taken on flesh in the evening time. I am the evidence. [applause] Hallelujah. Why don't you praise God? Praise God for the evidence. Praise God for the Holy Ghost. Praise God for the message. [applause] He sent back the evidence, the Holy Ghost, and I got it. &gt;&gt; We know that song. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I feel pretty good. &gt;&gt; Cuz I know what I used to be. But then I heard a message. &gt;&gt; It's not where you belong. &gt;&gt; It's not what you're here for. &gt;&gt; You're not here for a career. &gt;&gt; You're not here for some job. &gt;&gt; You're here for a purpose &gt;&gt; because God thought of you &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And he loved you. And he thought of you and he said, \"You know what? &gt;&gt; I want to have a bride. And I'm going to I'm going to place her right at the very climax of my great play and great drama. &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve, they played their part out in the beginning and on down through the patriarchs of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and on down through Elijah and Elisha and David and all the judges. And they all played all the way down to John the Baptist. And here come the word made flesh himself. &gt;&gt; And he played his part as far as a redeemer. and he he laid his life down with us and then he sent the evidence back. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost that it's no longer it's I that liveth in you, you and me and I in you. &gt;&gt; You were made for more. &gt;&gt; Some of us, you just need to walk away from that prison house you've been in. &gt;&gt; The rat race of Lady Oia. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the intellectual exercise of trying to make the message work, &gt;&gt; it'll drive you mad. &gt;&gt; It'll drive you insane. &gt;&gt; And there's there's plenty of casualties of people who have tried to make all the quotes fit together. You can't do it. &gt;&gt; You got to say, \"Lord, I believe it.\" &gt;&gt; Walk away from the unbelief. Just call out to the name of the Lord. Say, Lord, I want the Holy Ghost to energize my soul &gt;&gt; that I can play my part. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that song. I've been changed. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I've been changed [singing] here [music] free.

Please pray for Wanda Batman. She's in the ER with severe pain. Also, please pray for Josh and Megan Collins son Dawson. They ordered an echo tomorrow on his heart to check for any abnormalities. Every time you come off of seat pad, he struggles. Now, we believe the power of God that we've been feeling here ain't just good to make us feel good. &gt;&gt; It's not here just to stir our emotions. And it does stir our emotions. &gt;&gt; But we believe he ministers to the needy today. &gt;&gt; Can we pray together right now? And &gt;&gt; maybe somebody else didn't get personally ministered to today and you have a need. Just say, \"Lord, be mindful of me. Would you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for this wonderful time that we've had together, this visitation, Lord, of your presence here today. We thank you for these youth meetings. And we realize, Lord, it just wasn't for the youth, but we believe it's for all of us. Lord, you see, Lord Jesus, these needs that we've read. And Father, we're praying today that you'd move our sister Wanda Bman. You see the pain that she's dealing with and you know the cause of it. Lord, we pray, Father, for Dawson Collins and we're asking for your mercy for him. Dear Jesus, may your hand be extended, Lord. I know it's hundreds of miles away from us. They're in Ohio. But we know, dear God, there's no distance to you. Father, every individual here today that has a need in their home, their life, their family, would you move for them, Jesus? We pray that you'd restore our brother Matt's strength. Lord, we thank you, Father, for using him today to be a blessing to us Friday, yesterday as well. We're so grateful, Lord Jesus. We believe that we are living testimonies that Calvary was a success. &gt;&gt; May you go with us now, Lord. The food that's been prepared, may you bless it, nourish it our bodies. We ask, Lord God, in the name of Jesus. How many can say it's been really good to be in the house of the Lord? [applause] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. God bless you. Thank you, brother Matt. God bless you. May God restore his strength. And you keep this in mind as you go today. Maybe you're a little bit weary, a little bit down. You've been through a lot of things and may have had mistakes and failures, but keep this in mind in the coming days, will you? Your name is already there. Amen. &gt;&gt; So your name &gt;&gt; is waiting on you &gt;&gt; to get there. &gt;&gt; And God don't make no mistakes. [applause] Your name is there. Amen. [applause] Bless you. Sing some. We'll be dismissed. God bless you. Thank you so much for attending [music] the services this week for the youth from the different churches and the different adults, parents, and so on that came with your children. [music] Thank you.

over again God bless you to stand together some of the funniest things can happen in church can't you but we are not defeated today amen First Kings chapter 19 verse 1. last Sunday we closed out with Elijah calling fire down out of heaven killed in a whole bunch of prophets God manifesting himself in such a supernatural way today would like to look at after that great victory First Kings 19 1. an Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done which was calling fire out of Heaven killing the false prophets and then of course he called rain down after the fire it was all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah's saying so let the Gods she believed more than one due to me and more also if I make not thy life as a life of one of them by tomorrow about this time in other words you've got 24 hours to live now once you notice this next verse and when he saw that I find this verse amazing because of the way that the writer writes it when he saw that not when he heard it but when he saw it you see whenever you and I will hear something from the Devil and it becomes so real to us we start seeing it we're in trouble the devil tell you you're defeated you can't make it you go to sin it yourself you better pull back and say Lord help me readjust my vision and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to Beersheba which belonged us to Judah and left his servant there but he himself won a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and requested for himself that he might die which is so peculiar because he run for his life and now he's wanting God to take his life what a state we get in when we get down spiritually and said it is enough now O Lord take away my life for I am not better than my father's now remember there was a total of 850 Prophets there were 450 which was of the male deity that the Canaanites and Ahab worshiped which was Baal b-a-a-l there was another 400 prophets which was of the female deity astarting or Venus she was supposed to be the wife of Baal now Ahab had a divided home because he worshiped Baal which was idolatry of course and his wife Jezebel worshiped Authority or Venus now what's sad about this is Ahab was a Jew but what's easy to see who was the boss of the house Jezebel was just pray together father we love you today we thank you for your grace to us Lord and your mercy and we ask you Lord Jesus that you would help us as we look into your word today father May ever Spirit be captivated by the presence of God we rebuke the devil which is already tried to hinder us but he ain't hindering us Lord God I pray that every heart would be open to your word today may we be arrested as it was in the presence of God May the Holy Ghost come I pray and Minister the word as only you can do help me to get out of the way Lord Jesus to step aside that you can use that part of yourself which you placed in me speak to us father we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated I like the way Spurgeon quoted this situation about Elijah he said that Elijah retreated before a defeated enemy retreated before a defeated enemy when God's servants get out of the will of God they are liable to just about do or say anything it's incredible how that a man like this just a few hours before this morning stood in the presence of God and saw the miraculous like we've never read about it before By Any Man see what God did and yet at the threat of one woman one woman he gets tore all two pieces it's like he forgets everything God has just done and all the other things God has done prior to this and he gets so beside himself that he don't know what to do and he begins to thinking and saying things that don't even make sense now I'm not here so much today to criticize Elijah but to bring Elijah's life sorted down to our own sometimes and it's amazing when the people of God get to this kind of state that they will become so vulnerable in some of their strongest and greatest points now a man like this Elijah of course was a great courageous man a man Fearless with God a man that would stand up against all these prophets and not just stand against them verbally but take a sword and kill 450 of them and one slaying and face the potential of meeting the army of Ahab and do all of that without one shaking or quivering of his faith but yet now Something's Happened you know I found the same thing in the life of Abraham and the life of David and the life of others I'm sure us as well Abraham one of his greatest strong points was his faith but when Abraham got weak in faith and went down in the land of Egypt the very thing that was his strengths became his very stumbling block David which was a man of great songs and all that yet great David's greatest strength was not his singing it was not his musical ability it was his Integrity David was a man of such integrity and yet as we've been looking at the life of Bathsheba it was through this his greatest strengths that David become so vulnerable his Integrity then waned away and vanished he becomes a liar a trickster a deceiver is that right Moses switched the Bible says in the Book of Numbers was the meekest man on the face of the earth a man so Meek and so humble and a man of such a tender Spirit but yet he got into such a state that he turned into a man with such a temper that he lost his temper and actually had to Forfeit his right to going into the Promised Land I wonder sometimes if Satan don't take advantage of us in those times of our strengths and we say oh this will never happen to me I'm so strong my strength is this and this and this and I will never fall to that oh but how Satan loves to hear us brag about such I think of Peter in the New Testament another man of such courage yet his courage failed and he denied that he even knew the Lord Jesus no doubt he felt so strong I will never forsake you it makes no difference oh John he's a weakling and Thaddeus he's this and that and James the great he's this and the others but Lord I'll tell you one thing I'll never do it if anybody will stand by you it will be me and the very thing he bragged about was the very place he fell like Peter Elijah was a bold man a man of great strengths and a man of great courage and yet we see a phenomenon here before us now this happened in the country of Jezreel the valley of Jezreel where the battle of Armageddon will actually take place not too long from today and Elijah has confronted all these false prophets the 400 knew better than to show up the 400 of us starting they never even came but he killed the 450 of Baal and I imagine that there was so much blood shed that it run Plum off the place there when you look down from the valley of Jezreel and you look up the the highest place there facing north you face what is called Elijah's cave it was actually there that Elijah came out and stepped on the top of that high place there and there's where the altar was and where he defeated baal's false prophets but he hears this reply from Jezebel and the Bible tells us there he decided to leave so where does he head he's going to head to Beersheba now Beersheba is the most southern part of the land of Israel it was under a different King if you know your Bible by this time you know that the Kingdom of Israel has become divided in two parts so to have a king over one part of Israel and a king over another part of Israel which is called Judah now it just so happens that Elijah is under the Dominion of Ahab which is the king over Jerusalem and the northern part of the Kingdom so what he decides to do is he's going to run and he's going to leave and go to the southern part bear Sheba is 95 miles 95 miles from Jezreel where he's just obey made God and done this great miracle 95 miles now he knows he has about 24 hours now unlike you and I couldn't pick up his cell phone and call Uber he cannot pick up and get a a plane ticket down there or a bus the only thing that he had basically was his feet now I want you to think this man takes off at such haste that he arrives the next day and runs 95 miles now I want you to think of the anxiety and the fear and the trauma and all that he's going through now he's so nervous he's so beside himself he don't know what to do and the anointing has now left him now you and I can relate to that a little bit we know how it is when we get in the presence of God and wonderful things happen and all boys sometimes it don't even wait till Monday morning sometimes it hits you Sunday afternoon and the spirit of God don't seem like it's nowhere around you and you don't know what to do well it would be even more personified of course than a man like this so he didn't rest on his way so he takes off and he must have been at a very rapid Pace in order to make this journey of 95 miles now Jehoshaphat was the king of Judah Jehoshaphat was a good man he loved the Lord and yet but he knew that there was a weakness about Jehoshaphat and that was that he had made so Lord of an allegiance with Ahab so whenever he gets down there the Bible tells us that what Elijah did was he left his servant so him and his servant take on running and they go heading right toward the South's land and they arrive in Beersheba so when he gets there the Bible says that he leaves his servant there now I want you to notice as he's going along the journey he is deteriorating as he's going in his mind he's deteriorating in his strengths he's deteriorating he's hungry because this is one of the first things that God tells the angels to do is give him something to eat so apparently he took off at such a rapid rate he's running running can you imagine now you're running so fast you run 95 miles 95 miles I've been on this track myself and it's nowhere like Interstate 26 or a lot of our country here but up and down and around and up and down 95 miles from there and they take off in this journey now when they get there he's still he's under this thing and he's entered into a deeper state of this depression so he comes to a spot to where that he realizes now there's only one man that knows where I am and that is my servant so he decides to leave the servant there he doesn't even trust him no longer you know this is something when we get down and we get weary and we go to fight and all kinds of things and one of the first things that Satan wants to do is begin to isolate us from other people people that we love people that love us and convince us really you can't trust anybody now what makes that more real is because we've all been betrayed by people have we not we've been betrayed by friends or have been betrayed by a family member sometimes betrayed by preachers or people that you have confidence in and whenever something like that happens you can't get over it overnight I don't care who you are so Satan then will bring that back whenever you're in a state like Elijah was in so he doesn't feel like that he can even trust his servant so he leaves him there and then the scripture tells us he goes on a little further now actually where he's going to go he's going to go into the Negev Desert now he's going into that spot which you've never been there or never seen places like it it's a very incredible place has its own Beauty but yet it has deaths everywhere you look at it it's absolutely a place of dryness hardly no trees no plants whatsoever and dry there hardly any rain at all hardly nothing to eat and here heads the prophet because now he Ventures 15 more miles so now he's run 95 miles within a 24-hour period and he takes off again I trade gobs his servant and he's got 15 more miles and he just goes deeper and deeper and deeper into this dry Barren spot how many has ever been there spiritually oh yeah we've all had our negative desert have we not now I want you to notice now in verse 4 that he himself went a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree now here he comes and he finally arrives 15 more miles into the Wilderness and he fills up by now he's safe I'm okay they won't be able to find me now and I'll be able to get there so he sees this juniper tree or as it's called in the Hebrew a broom tree now broom tree which would have white types of leaves which would be able to reflect this Mediterranean Sun it was also a place to where he could be able to refresh himself and think but he looks around he has no water he has no food he has no company so he's all by himself now whenever he gets to here I want you to listen now the prophet of God of this day which says the spirit of Elijah on him tells us what happens to Elijah the prophet is that he goes into a nervous breakdown now he he's already feeling all of this threat and all of this pressure and no doubt this had been accumulating for a long time it would be almost impossible for a man to have a nervous breakdown just going from a well State and within 24 hours having a nervous breakdown so more than likely it was the work and the load and the responsibility that was building up on this man and after this he felt like he was a failure because God had come down in a great way and he felt like apparently in his heart that the whole nation would now turn back to God and everybody's going to look around and say oh what God did what a great thing well there's no way anybody else could do that Bale couldn't do it Venus asteroth I thought he could not do that no other gods of the heathens could do such a thing and he must have been sort of like Jonah was when he felt like God is going to do a great thing and when it didn't not happen it must have seemed like a total failure because it was as if though what God had done meant absolutely nothing now we've never seen anything like that since is that right it's never been done quite like that since but it was like the he looked toward the miracle and he had something else in mind that the miracle is going to lead to the Revival of the whole nation but it didn't instead of leading to the Revival of the whole nation it turned them more against him and when Ahab goes home and tells Jezebel and the messenger comes back and tells Elijah now it seems like he's a complete failure which is one of the worst things any of us can feel like now whether you are a preacher whether you are a housewife or a husband or a child whatever you are if you're an electrician if you're a builder to feel like that you are a failure and want your called to do it's one of the greatest disappointments any of us can have so if you're already under the stress of that load your sisters that are Housewives and God bless each of you forgiving of yourself to your husbands and your children and you'll have a great reward one day you are very very very looked over in the day we're living because uh with laodicea the women who are the most I don't you know adored and all that lifted up in this age are those women who have some sort of great you know degree in college and their their women professionals and this and that and the other oh a great achievement is going to be achieved today before the Super Bowl will ever start uh the pilots that are going to fly over over by with the Navy Plains all of them will be women and All America feels like women are finally rising to their place they could have no higher place than what God gave them in the beginning but yet this is the way we think why because our nation is Anointed with that dominant thing that the women will be the leader in the last day this is why they will accept Jezebel spiritual to be their head and yet women then that are Housewives most of you women I don't figure will ever find F-35 or an F-22 or you'll never be out there glory to God throw in your long hair back working on a jet engine no most of you sisters probably the only kind of Grease you're ever going to have between your fingers is not ancient Greece it's going to be from cooking muffins and chicken and fried taters and stuff like that so in the eyes of the world then you all are nobodies you're nothing well let me tell you something that's absolutely alive from the pits of Hell God could give you no greater position than to be a woman and to be a housewife if that's so designed of God's purpose don't you let the feminism of this age make you sinful you are nothing because you will stand there that day of the Lord Jesus will reward you with a great reward is that right well while we're at it let's just go ahead brothers and give our sisters a nice hand I thank God for every daughter of God around the world they're a great treasure but we can see then what one woman in the hands of the devil does so here he's in the Negev Desert he's all by himself no one there around him and he finally goes into this state he feels like a failure his work has been so difficult for years and then the Bible says he requested for himself that he might die now look at where he's at he's just completed this journey of 95 miles overnight and a day and he's run till he's absolutely wore out and now he drops his servant off to anybody Sheba and he heads off another 15 miles he's already exhausted he's warned till he don't know what to do he's nearly beside himself and he was running for what running for death he was running for his life to be saved right then after he gets to Bear Sheba what does he do he said God I don't want to live no longer well what in the world did you just run over a hundred miles for if you don't want to live no longer look at how we can become when we get so stressed out that we don't even make sense well don't sit there and look at me funny y'all know what I'm talking about he said is it enough is it enough now oh Lord take away my life for I am not better than my father's now from this statement it would make you wonder if Elijah began to sink too highly of himself now I want you to notice this statement take away my life oh Lord for he says I am not better than my father so who told him that he was where did he get this idea that he was better than his father's now he's confessing he is not so you see he flees from death and now he prays for death it's the combination of emotional burnout emotional burnout and stress and the pressure of being a man in this office and feeling like that he's a total failure and I'll tell you one thing if we ever get to that spot we are in Dangerous Ground this is why people take their lives because they feel like their what their life is absolutely wasted so look at him he's in he's in total burnout he's feeling and experiencing a weariness which he's never felt before on top of that the man is so hungry he can hardly even go now you can imagine you're running running you don't think they even take no no food with you you got to get out there and you got to run fast and he's burned up all this energy running all night long and all day and then he drops him off his servant in Beersheba and he takes off another 15 miles can you imagine any of us running that far that's a joke I imagine some of us if we run three would be calling McDonald's we'd be called an Uber everybody else bring me some food bring me some food I can't make it no longer is this journey over how far are you I'm a thousand yards from the church come and get me I can't make an old father now you can imagine all of this accumulation of this stuff together so he's got emotional burnout and he's weary he's so exhausted and the man is basically starving to death and he has no no water that we know of and then he has this deep sense of failure deep sense of failure and then he let's just be honest he has a lack of faith something has now happened from that great miracle to where he thinks God will not take care of him now if you look at it really he there's no better place he could be than in the valley of Jezreel in the will of God you're better off in the valley of Jezreel facing the army of Ahab and the army of Jezebel then you are to be under oh my a juniper tree out in the middle of nowhere and not having faith to believe God can move for you so here he is he's also dealing with the lack of faith well let's just go ahead and be honest whenever we hear a bad report from the doctor or we look at something in a negative way and we begin to say oh no oh no will God move for me will it not oh god oh no God what are you going to do what are you dealing with you're dealing with Satan trying to battle your face and convince you that God won't do it this time he's done it before and he's done it for others but he won't do it for you and what are you battling a lack of faith well I'm not sure will he do it well I know he can oh sure if you've seen him do much you know he can't but do you know he will for you you see most of us Satan will not battle us can God do it we've seen him do so much that's even Beyond question is it not we know we can heal the sick we know it can heal cancer we've seen him do it we've seen him perform Miracle after Miracle but what is him when it comes right down to it will he do it for me oh my so here he is and now he has a nervous breakdown notice in verse 5 and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat can you imagine as he lays there and he's shaking and quivering and maybe he can't even talk and he's he's in a terrible terrible state crying lamenting thinking all types of thoughts I I want to die I don't even want to live no more I have nothing to live for I failed God I failed God's people maybe it was about this time he realized by what he had done he had made the situation worse because now he's going to appear to his church as if though he is a running coward oh it must not have hit him near as realistically as it did till he got under the juniper tree and I realized this what did I just do I cannot believe I have done this I have run from Jezebel I I defy the army of Ahab I killed 450 prophets by myself with a sword that had to take Supernatural strength of one man against 450. but then when the anointing leaves him and the only thing that gets on his mind is just run just run don't raise your hands but I wonder how many of you whenever you face trials and things as I said don't raise your hand but I wonder how many of you have contemplating getting in your car and starting it and never coming back never look back and what's amazing is you really have no plan where you're going well where are you going you're going to Estes Park and you know you're going where are you heading you're heading down to uh Florida where are you going I don't know I'm just I'm just out of here don't you see where you are don't you see where you are y'all you just got to leave so the thing is run where do we get that at because that's the way our father felt in the Garden of Eden when he fell and he didn't know what to do so the thing is just run away run away just run and run from your problems but you won't run away from your problems you'll be taking them with you now you might run from your wife from your children from the boss and this and that and the other but all them thoughts and all them issues they're right in here and they're right up here and they're in your spirit and they're in your thought pattern now you imagine what he gets down there and then it hits him and I chose it what have I done my Ministry is ruined well all the church all the elect of God if there's any of them left he even got that low there can't be a saved person left I'm the only one dear God only me it's amazing how we get so self-righteous in it ah even I I'm the only one left oh my but there's one thing I love about our father even though no doubt the light of this was self-inflicted to the Prophet Elijah maybe the Lord warned him over and over again you're getting too tired you're getting too worn you're getting weary better take a break no I'm good I'm good I'm strong look at me Lord I'm strong you better take a break better take a day off no that's a sign of weakness I don't need a day off Hallelujah I'm the mighty Elijah now the mighty Elijah is laying under a tree shaking like a leaf in the Wind no food no water no desire to even live you probably saw it as he felt sleep coming over him I hope I don't even wake up I hope to God I don't even wake up because I do not want to live another day I'm a failure and now I've kept it all off I run how in the world can I ever hold my head up again before God's people I'm a complete ruination I'll never preach again or maybe you're a housewife I'll never make another bed I'll never make another pancake I'll never do I can't stand it no more I'm such a failure all this has been heard in another dimension and father has a great delegation that is being gathered to go down to the Negev and they're being dispatched to meet at the juniper tree father says I want the angel with the softest hand to go down first and I want the best cook that there is among you I mean those God's got angels that know how to cook I want the angel that can cook the best I want this one I want that one I want you to go down and attend my prophet now let me just tell you today the Lord God still has those angels around with a soft touch if you're needing to touch today from his presence and he lay and slept under a juniper champion oh then an angel s so the angel with the softest touch just reaches over and touches him now you imagine father saying don't alarm him he's in such a state it could terrify him it could absolutely send him into a stroke or a heart attack Because he believes he's out here by himself in the middle of nowhere so the angel gently gently wake up Elijah dear beloved one of God wake up what is it it's okay it's okay I'm sent from the presence of God to tell you he's heard your cries Hallelujah then the other Angel is already there the best cook and he comes brings him what looks like something that is so simple and he says arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake bacon on the coals so this Angel also knew had a lot of Fire and you imagine a lie Elijah's laying their soul wound up in this if you notice it I'm sure that many times some people get so depressed they don't feel like getting out of bed many of them don't feel like getting dressed they don't feel like combing their hair Lord God use me this morning father I pray they don't feel like grooming themselves or taking care of themselves they just don't care anymore so while he's there the angel builds a fire and he's right there near him any he sees there was a cake bacon on the coals and a cruise of water at his head and he didn't eat and drink and laid him down again now the angel packs all kinds of vitamins in this corn cake you say how do you know it was corn because Elijah this day said it was corny ought to know so he packed all types of vitamins and nutrients and minerals and protein and carbs and all these things that his body needed because a man wasn't just finding a spiritual battle he was finding a natural body you know what as well as I do that when people get under a great load many times they lose their appetite and you can see it on their face their face speaks volumes that they're just not themself if they had a smile a certain smile they will still put on a certain smile all of us are still actors and we can act to a certain degree that everything was all right but the ACT smile is not the same as the true smile they act laugh and they act giggle it's not the same as the true one come on the ACT amen and the ACT Clapping Your Hands and the acts praising the lord it's not the same as the real one so they wake him up and he finally gets up and he he grabs a cruise of all and he or water rather he just still he just kind of adults in the means of person poor Feller bless his heart look at him I ain't never seen him like this before he's an awful shape that ever was poor guy so maybe they're helping me you just shake it he did here here let me help you so we're going to stick in that corn cake I can't talk I don't I don't feel like talking no no that's okay Elijah you don't need to talk just lay back down just say back down we'll be here with you we'll watch over you you're no longer alone Hallelujah you were no longer alone and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the image of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat I want you to notice the difference in this verse in verse 5. the first verse 5 he just tells him arise and eat but this time he adds a little more to the message and he says because the journey is too great for thee isn't it amazing that an angel of God but only say these words arise and eat three words he didn't want to startle him he didn't want to shake him he's so torn up that he can only comprehend even so much word he can only only comprehend so much love and care I find this so phenomenal that we as human beings can get so tore up and so apart from the reality of the love of God that God gently has to remind us again I love you I care for you I died for you I come to set you free and he knows sometimes if he gives it to you too much we're just going to automatic shutdown emotionally we're so burnt out we just can't even take the good oh Lord but this time the angel says arise and eat and then he says because the journey is too great fuzzy and he rose and did eat and drink and went in the strengths of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto Horeb the Mount of God from Beersheba to Horeb there's 145 miles walking of course I don't know but this time after he got all these corn cakes he might have been flying a little bit every now and then you might have just been hitting the hot spots on the Negev Desert can you imagine a man being able to eat Glory too little corn cakes and on the strengths of them corn cakes able to go for 40 days and 40 nights I want you to notice here in verse 9 and he came thither into the cave and lodged there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what do us thou hear Elijah I'd like to ask you that this morning what are you doing here not in this building but where you are in your walk was God if you're in this depressed state what are you doing there Jesus never purchased just depression for you Jesus never purchased sadness for you and gave you sadness as part of your inheritance as a believer what are you doing here so sad so just but I've failed him I've messed up joined the crowd our church this morning has hundreds and hundreds of people in it who's failed him who's messed up who's let him down who's let down their friends their family well anybody here besides me down there so what do a style here Philip what do us thou here Greg what you notice brother Branham says it this way Elijah had a breakdown when he was under the juniper tree John had a breakdown in the prison he was a high-pitched Prophet them nerves on edge and his Eagle Eye filmed over little Elijah's heart was broke any Minister knows what Monday morning is after a hard day on Sunday compare that you Preachers Wives you know how your husband is on Monday morning after he's preached hard two or three times Sunday so worn out what do you think about Portillo Elijah there he was no one to comfort him and he stopped under this gender petrainian knelt down and he looked up to God and said Lord I'm so tired and so weary why don't you just take my life and let me go my father's all went so let me go men who deal in the Supernatural who stay on the presence of God and when you see God's program turned down and you preach it and you try your best and you do everything that God tells you to do and still they walk away from it it's heartbreaking it's heartbreaking he said a poor little fella skinny laying there gray hair hanging over his shoulder God said my servant needs some rest God's mercy to his servant he just laid him down on a bunch of weeds and he went to sleep I'd imagine there was 10 000 angels watching him sleep there was one Assurance a Believer has though the world turned him down yet God loves him the world may call you a Holy Roller they may call you fanatic but if you're true to God there's one sure thing God loves you and his angels are encamped about those who fear Him oh Hallelujah I'd imagine on every limb all around to the place of swarms of angels and God came down and said not poor little tired servant he's so nervous and so tore up he don't know what to do I want to pick out the angel here that's got the softest hands don't you scare him Hallelujah walk over and stroke his brow write easy and I want the best cook among you you go up there and get all the vitamins you can find and put in this corn meal the world's turned him down oh my but I'm going to treat him right Hallelujah that means praise our God don't get scared of that bring forth the best that we got to cook him a corn cake and set him down some water and this soft handed Angel went over and stroked a little servant of God on the brow remember if you've done your best God's still got those angels in order he loves you just the same as he loved Elijah now either we believe that statement or we don't I choose to believe it I believe God loves me just as much as he did Elijah I believe God loves you but brother Donnie I failed him and so did Elijah and so have I and so did Moses and so did Peter and so did every other person that's ever served him you're going to fall and make mistakes and fall short of the glory of God but the question is what are you going to do when you mess up you're going to lay down there and wallow in yourself pity or are you gonna rise and say Lord forgive me and try me one more time Lord forgive me for my mistakes forgive me for my failures try me once more Lord try me Elijah rubbing his eyes raising up his little frail shaking hands take a hold of the bread needed just the great Angelic choir come down and formed a little panoramic around him like that and begin to sing the Psalms like no mother could cool her baby to sleep let him seep again the father turned around and said you know I love him so much and the Journey's great he's got a lot to go through yet I'm not through with him so I must feed him again so he called the angels and dumped in another big bundle of vitamins I believe God still got that bundle of vitamins today don't you and cooked up another corn cake and set him a cruise of water and stroked his brow and fed him again I'm so glad that there is a juniper tree when we get all war and tore up we can go under that juniper tree and find spiritual vitamins to travel any kind of trip so let me tell you something if you're facing a juniper tree today of a sickness or a disease or a bad diagnosis from the doctor maybe God's got a juniper tree for you and he wants to have an angel of God a messenger a pastor or an evangelist amen that's God's Messengers

like that you do God provided the corn for us to have a corn cake as a matter of fact when the corn was on the earth he said this in Saint John 12 23. Jesus answered them saying they always come that the son of man shall be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die to bite us alone but if it die it bringeth Force much fruit Hallelujah God had everything we would ever need packed in that corn Jesus Christ and he was ground out under the Roman birth and released the healing power the saving power the delivering power for whatever you need right here in this building today those of you that are streaming the service around the world if you're in New Zealand if you're in Australia you're in

stand and say by the grace of God I'm gonna eat my way through this depression I'm going to eat my way out of this trial of sickness and disease and trouble I'm going to eat God's provided corn cake for the hour and I'm on a drink of the Waters of Life freely [Applause] look at what David said in Psalm 61 1. to the chief musician upon Nagina a Psalm of David You're My Cry Oh God attend unto my prayer from the end of the Earth While I Cry unto thee when my heart this overwhelmed and the word overwhelmed means to turn aside to envelop oneself to be feeble faint or grow weak when my heart is overwhelmed Or Glory somebody Lead Me To The Rock that is higher than ours you notice David didn't say get that by himself hey but he said lead me if I may know sometimes we need to be led sometimes we just gets so weak and so feeble that we don't know what to do and we thank God I don't know I don't know a way out of this situation I don't know what to do I've done everything I know to do and seem like everything I've tried to do has been a failure well somebody lead me out of this place and let me tell you today God don't just use preachers to leave those weak and sick among us sometimes a word from a lay member just an encouraging text and encouraging something on Instagram if you're going to use social media why don't you use it for the benefit and the glory of God instead of a place to hang out your dirty laundry and the trash of your family and all the things that people are going through come on now use it for the glory of God let people know you're a Christian let people know you don't delve and the garbage of this world but you're going to use every means available to witness to somebody about not only this saving power but they encouraging power use your Instagram account as a way to share a corn cake use your Facebook as a way to share a piece of corn cake it might be somebody's sad I'm the problem somebody would preach with me this morning and they are depressed and they are weary use your Facebook as something that will say I'm here to help you I'm here to pray with you I'm here to lead you to that rock that is bigger than you are that is higher than you [Applause] foreign oh David goes on to say for thou has been a shelter for me and the Strong Tower from the enemy I will abide in thy Tabernacle forever I will trust in the comfort of thy wings Salah Psalms 142 2 I poured out my complaint before him I showed him before him I so notice I showed before him my trouble when my spirit was overwhelmed Within Me then thou knowest my path in the way we're in I walked have they privately laid a snare for me I looked on my right hand and beheld and there was no man that would know me Refuge failed me no man cared for my soul I mean it's ever been there oh it's one thing I love about the Psalms they are more one the most powerful books in the Bible as far as victory but when it comes down to just relating to humanity and the things you go through you know some preachers preach Christianity as if though you should never have a trial that's a line preacher a preacher that tells you you're going to be on the Mountaintop all the time it's not telling you the Full Gospel I'm telling you you're going to fight Devils you're going to fight hell you're going to fight disease you're going to fight trouble but the good thing about it is you can win amen you can win by the grace of God you're not going to get a reward if you don't fight and we must fight greater than ever before all hell has broke loose against the people of the last day we can feel it out on the world I just heard it this week on the news that they are so alarmed the psychiatrists and psychologists because the increase of mental illness and sickness has attacked the Young Generation and there's an increase of over one-third compared to what it was two years ago and the doctors are so concerned because suicide has raised but I rebuke that suicide devil from amongst our people in the name of Jesus take your leave from the saints of God we have everything to live for we have everything to fight for we're not survivors but we are more than conquerors than him who gave himself for us we have a corn cake called Christ Jesus and we will win there is oh Hallelujah there is no devil that can defeat us oh Hallelujah [Applause] ah foreign I said Thou Art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living attend unto My Cry for I am brought very low deliver me from my persecutors for they are stronger than I bring my soul out of prison that I may praise thy name the righteous shall Compass me about now watch his Faith's confession you see some people still struggle and trying to understand the balance of talking Faith talk and they seek that if you say well how you doing I'm good I'm fine everything's well that's your faith and language but is there anything wrong with telling them when you get in pain look what you remember I'm sick today I need help I I need prayer today people are afraid to even request prayer on such things because they think they're that's a negative testimony that's not a negative testimony your testimony is by his stripes I'm Healed but I need a little bit of help to get from point A to point B I'm dragging my leg I'm a little bit sad I'm a little bit depressed would you pray for me but what's your confession My Confession is by Stripes I'm already healed My Confession is I am more than a caucus of him that loved him or Hallelujah I am more I'm going to come right out of this Valley and I'm going to lift my hands and praise the Lord but until the manifestation hits me would you pray for me hallelujah hallelujah oh but David says I will be compassed by the righteous I may be feeling low today I may be hungry I may be weary I may be shaken under the juniper tree but I ain't going to stay here alone because Mount Horeb is calling me you remember what Mount Horeb was it's what almighty God met Moses and my whole Hallelujah Elijah had that inkling if he could go back to where the Prophet had his experience maybe he could have his I don't want to point you today to this fine building I don't want to point you to some organization somewhere I want to point you to the man Christ Jesus who come to set you free from a life full of sin go there and have an experience with God and their Devils will bow to the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] Psalm 143 verse 3. for the enemy hath persecuted my soul he have smitten my life down to the ground he hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have long been long dead therefore is my spirit notice what David keeps saying his spirit his Spirit remember what we're dealing with this extended series on Bathsheba all that she must have took with her to the Palace all the trauma all the fear all the bad memories of an adultery all the bad memories of her husband being killed by the man who is now her husband David you imagine trying to fall in love with a man that killed your husband now if you didn't like her husband you might thank him but it's evidence she was in love with him and he was in love with her and then you have to marry the king and you got to fall in love with him wow therefore it's my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate I remember the days of old I meditate on all thy works I Muse on the work of thy hands let me close with this the prophet says that this way we're living in an erotic age if you said this in May of 1962 what would he say in February of 2023. we're living in a neurotic age nervous tension everybody's racing here and there and going there and going nowhere ain't that the truth they will run slap dab over you if you're you know how many ever seconds slow in front of them and what they do is they wow like that and get to the stoplight three seconds before you do which means they get to set they're three seconds longer than you do and they hurried down to the stoplight so they could get there but they feel better because they beat you and they got around you well come on now don't sit there and look at me which are you all the slowpokes are the ones who go around and beat them to the traffic light okay all right we'll not ask that but what does it create a nervous tension people are so nervous they're living you know how it is they're living it's such a thing you pull out in front of somebody I mean they'll shake their fist at you they'll do this and that and the other you get a parking spot at Walmart and somebody else saw it they was on the other side of the parking lot but they wanted that and you're right here and get it they still think you ought to give that to them and yet they'll walk three miles in their neighborhood in the evening for exercise I'm talking about a people that are out of their mind why don't you take part of that exercise and at Walmart it's that kind of an age he said and I know this church has plagued with it as everywhere else the Tabernacle this plate you what the Tabernacle or the prophet of God pastored you mean Elijah's Ministry could not keep nervous tension off of his own church hello Ma it's a day of pressure hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry somebody needs to write a song hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry up and wait drop 90 miles an hour to get home for supper and then wait two hours for it to get ready in that rushing and speeding it gets you to a nervous tension the wives say something a little contrary and you want to fly off temper husband say something you patch your foot and tell him to get in the room or something this is for some of these people to stream the services of course uh-huh now husband I don't want no words with you get out of here oh my God wife oh I'm so nervous wow what's the matter all this together this tension is building up then the results of it is doing something wrong and acting out of place nobody raise your hands don't bat an eye don't move I wonder how many of us are guilty of this tension pressure and you say something to your wife to your husband to your children to your friends y'all done good you can say Amen now so does it make us do something wrong now how many honest people how much ever got under attention and said something you would to God you'd never said wish you would have never acted in such a way yes so you know what we need friends I think I figured out the recipe of what we need to help us deal with tension we need to eat more corn cakes we need to feed more on Christ the word oh my goodness he says it'll make the poor act that way the middle class sacked that way the rich act that way it'll make the wrong act that way it'll make the pretty good act that way that sounds like to me he's covering everybody it'll make the the good act that way because it's tension steam built up got to blow it out somewhere if you don't you'll blow the boiler up and you'll find it builds up as the day goes and you talk to your boss if you're working also and so on you speak to the kid to come in here Mom if you're here oh it builds up oh my you feel like you're gonna the head's gonna come off I know I'm with it every day I know what it means it builds up now you see your hot water heater unless you have on the instant type if you have the one with the tank it has what is called a pop-off valve comes out either at the top or at the bottom depends on which type of water here it is brother Mike could come tell us and explain it to us about how it works better than I could but it's in case the thermostat gets stuck on the inside if I understand it right and it don't turn itself off and it's just sitting there heating oh okay now my search rocks me I tell one thing I wanted that certain sheet sitting right up there and who's sitting in that seat one of them little smarter like boys don't they know why I have a hard time hearing don't they know I wanted that seat so bad I can't understand it I'll tell you one thing I'm going to quit the church if I don't get that table I know you may have your favorite pick of a seat but you ought to be so happy to be in this place if you had to sit in the floor you'd say thank God we're not in the holiday yet you didn't have my seat no takers huh I meant this one not here if we want to love God and go to church we ought to be so happy I'll tell you I don't like them lights what do you think about them panel I don't think I'm going back because I don't want them panels I don't I just we ought to be so happy to be in the house of God that we say Lord have mercy do you notice this I've never even noticed I'm so happy I just are grateful to have our own church back I was just so happy to be in the house of God did you notice it nope didn't notice it what I noticed was that word in the presence of God and the singing the Clapping the hand glory to God I'm so happy I'm so God well I just believe I'll fulfill what David said happy is the people whose God is the Lord I'm going to go and I'm going to clap my hands all you people I'm on a shout by the voice of Triumph I'm going to praise him I'm going to bless his name I'm just happy to be in church or You're Building pressure well all our hope is I'm not around when you blow look friends from the rich to the poor everyone it crosses every racial barrier every cultural barrier everybody is under pressure America the Great great nation of America and we just allowed a Chinese balloon to fly across our military spots our silos and Montana uh-huh we're great aren't we can't you see it our nation is weakening our image before the world is weakening why would they do that they wouldn't dare do that on certain presidents we've had before they certainly wouldn't have done that on one of my favorite Mr Ronald Reagan uh-huh you imagine them send nothing over Ronnie oh Ronnie would have took care of them Hollywood style he'd have blowed them Plum to Smithereens but what does it do it's a weakness everywhere and what's it create more pressure for us hey we ain't got access to them bombs thank God we don't we we're trusting our government to take care of us well I don't mind telling you I don't feel too comfortable with the job they're doing well come on now what's it do it creates more pressure I'm glad my trust is not in our president I'm glad our trust is not in the army or the defense or the Congress or the Senate my trust is in the Lord God Almighty my confidence is in him I found a place where we can relieve the pressure in Christ Jesus let me read one more to you I look at the world today what attention the whole world lives in and you go down the street and it's not even safe to drive this is 1964. not even safe to drive it's not even safe to be on a four-lane highway everybody's at attention snapping what's the matter quieten down where are you going what was it's making the world insane and the incident insane institutions are filling up that's what's the church in such a turmoil they're so they're so head bound on a certain thing they won't stop and consider God's word in the hour We're living all under a strain tension listen the church age book in the thyatitis are changed each age had its pressures for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in did that say it or not an age like we live in soft living nervous tension in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in every day we're here it seems less Like Home to me I want to be ready to leave you see the precious building greater and greater and greater and one of these days we're going to be squeezed right out because the pressure will come and the squeeze will come against us and we leave this place in a moment in the twinkling of an eye this barriers if you have praise the Lord Jesus I'm wondering before we pray today how many of you would like to be remembered maybe you're just feeling such pressure such strength maybe you don't feel so much like Elijah the prophet but just a believer a housewife a husband a layperson that loves God and you feel so much pressure just of life every day living I can't imagine how the people who are the world leaders how they must feel they can feel it too but friends in spite of your failures don't you let the devil tell you there's no need to try anymore you've failed him you've let him down so many times why would he ever reach out to you again well I can answer that for you because he loves you so much he loves you so much he loves you beyond your failures your mistakes your shortcomings Hallelujah pick up your pieces bring them to Jesus but brother Donnie I came well I'll tell you what then I'll make you an offer I'll help you pick them up if you can't call me if you can't come up and let me pray for you myself these other brothers many of these Saints in this building today will do everything we can to help you deal with the precious of life if I could I would take much of it off have you but the lord loves you more than that you see he loves you so much he knows that when you deal with pressure helps make you stronger I look at you as your pastor and I think oh God take it off of him please Lord but he sees what he's going to make out of you I mean let's be remembered today as we pray God bless each of you oh my goodness those of you out streaming the service those of you that'll archive it you just raise your hand though where you are as well Heavenly Father we more than likely cannot relate to exactly the scope of the pressure that Elijah felt because we don't have that office and that responsibility that he had but each of us in our own calling in her own position we can relate maybe the person here today that would feel like they are the least Among Us they feel like they're the most insignificant person that you ever saved but if they could only believe you love them just as much as you did Elijah you don't love Moses any better than you love me you don't love Peter James or John anymore than you love me and you love Peter so much when he messed up terribly denied you in his strength he felt like he could stand but it turned against him and he was so weak imagine he must have felt so embarrassed and so ashamed how could he ever face you again how could he ever face the rest of the disciples that never think the same about him that always talk about him behind his back say he was a coward but in spite of all of that you loved him so much you sent word Hallelujah tell my disciples and Peter that I have risen from the dead Hallelujah you knew me but struggle you knew he would have a hard time so you called him by name oh Jesus would you do something similar here today father in the name of Jesus Christ May the spirit of God deal with everyone here today who needs this strength this courage Lord We Worship You Lord God whatever Journey lays before them give them strength from the corn of God the bread of life we partake of you today Lord Jesus as we feed on the word give us strength we need for this week for tomorrow for next month if we live next year if you Terry strengthen us Lord God can we just raise our hands in the presence of the Lord hearsing something let's just open our hearts now before we go or you may have plans today for dinner and this and that and the other but let's just let's just think for just a minute now the presence of God here to help you here to minister to you maybe you're under that tree and you're shaken you're quivering you don't know what to do Jesus still has angels with self-tamps still has Angels under his inspiration that can prepare a meal that would give you

He looked beyond all my faults and saw my need. Aren't you glad that he did? Give the Lord a good hand this morning. If you would praise the Lord. So good to be in the house of the Lord. We had a glorious time here Wednesday night. How many of you appreciate the word of the Lord? when the service just tremendous. &gt;&gt; So, we're here again today just looking to what God would have for us. I believe he's going to give us something wonderful again today. Don't you &gt;&gt; look at your neighbor, shake their hand, tell them you're glad to see him in the house of the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. What a privileged people we are to get to come to the house of the Lord. Have any visitors with us today? And we do have some.

We want to say God bless those folks as well. Could we give all these people a good hand this morning if you would? Praise the Lord. We're going to look at our prayer request this morning. If you don't mind, I'm going to get you let you just stand and and get yourself woke up cuz you're not singing very good at all this morning. You're just not you're just not up to snuff this morning, as the old saying goes. So, stretch yourself a little bit. Get your lungs loosened up. Somebody say, \"Praise the Lord.\" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, \"Praise the Lord.\" &gt;&gt; Now, give him another good hand clap of praise this morning. Hallelujah. This is a just a note of thanks from the sisters that have lost their husbands. Uh they uh they want to say thanks to brother Don and sister Carol for attending and hosting a lunchon yesterday. Uh just they appreciate it so very much.

And then we're certainly have glad to have brother Greg Robbins back in service with us today. God bless you, brother Greg. Brother Greg is going to come and and and give you just a little testimony. You want to address the church and while you're up here, just lead us to the Lord in prayer on behalf of these prayer requests. Will you do that? And all the unspoken prayer requests. I know there's many needs among us this morning. All of you that have a need, we'll just commit it all under the Lord. Let's sing that chorus together one more time. He looked beyond my fault and he fixed whatever was wrong with me. Aren't you glad that you done that for you? How many of you was full of faults? How many of you still a flawed human being, but he's still working on us, isn't he? Give the Lord one more good hand clap of praise. I shall for sing it. [Music] [Applause] Oh, to view the cross. Sing it. [Music] [Music] I won't take but second of each time. I just wanted to thank everyone for your prayers when I went into the operating room. I was laying there in the bed and I could feel the prayers of the saints all over me. And y'all don't know what it meant to me. It meant everything to me. And I just want to thank each and every one of you for your prayers. Uh cuz it was a tremendous help to me. And so let's just take these knees to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, as we come before your throne this morning, we come with praise. We come with thanksgiving. We've come with love in our hearts to you, dear Father, for all your grace and mercy. How gracious you are to each and every one of us. Lord, you're with us when we don't deserve it. You guide us when we don't deserve your leadership. We praise you today, dear Father, from the bottom of our hearts for all that you do for each and every one of us. And we bring before you this morning all these needs of these people, which are many. And Lord, we know that you know each and every one of them. And we know that you're aware of each and every one of them. And Lord, if they didn't want them answered, they would have never wrote them in. So I pray today, dear father, from the bottom of my heart that you go to each and everyone individually and answer these prayers and touch them and let them know that you're with them. Let them you know that you're there to help them. Let them know that you want to be on their side. How we praise you today, dear Father, for all you do for us. How we love you for it. How we thank you for it. And we believe everything that you tell us, Lord Jesus, in your word. For your word is true. And we know that that word will keep us, Lord Jesus, if we'll only believe. And we thank you for faith today, dear Father. We thank you for that faith that you've placed with inside of our hearts, inside of our souls to believe that word. So many people don't understand. So many people don't have that faith. But I thank you for the faith that you've given to each and every one of us this morning. Lord Jesus, we just bring you honor and we give you praise this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. God bless you. Give Brother Greg a nice hand this morning. Praise the Lord. We certainly appreciate Brother Greg and Sister Shirley. They've been here a long long time. Right at 40 years, I believe. And we were just a a great great addition to our They make a good church better, don't they? &gt;&gt; They really do. Give him one more good hand if you would. Praise the Lord. Amen. Now, October is Pastor Appreciation Month. And we want to appreciate Brother Don and Sister Carol this month. &gt;&gt; We appreciate them every month, don't we? We certainly do. That's a card of thanks to Brother Don and Sister Carol. Let's sing that little song together this morning. Aren't you glad that in a world filled with all kinds of situations that our God still reigns? How many of you glad about it this morning?

[Music] [Applause] If y'all would help me sing this song, it's if you asked me if we had just a random conversation, Brother Justin, what's your favorite song? It would this would be my answer. And the longer that I live here, the more that I get more homesick for that land. Help me sing it. [Music] I have seen some pretty towns. Guess you could say that I've been around, but I found no place to settle down. But there is a land. [Music] I am just a pilgrim here. Toiling through this old world of fear. My time to leave is drawing near. I'm going to land. There is a land I'm so homesick for. Oh, I've never seen it before. I've got loved ones waiting on that shore. There is a there and it's not a million miles away or on some far off distant strand. Oh, I'll speed up and slow down. There is a land. Why am I so homesick for just not myself here anymore? I'm longing for that hope. on door and that leads to that land. [Music] So I'll drop my weeping eyes and I'll lift my head toward the sky. Farewell to this old world. Goodbye. I'm going to that land. There is a lamb. I'm so homesick before. Although I've never seen it before. I've got loved ones waiting on that shore. Oh, there is a land and it's not a million miles away or on some far off distance train. I'll speed up and they'll slow down. There is a land. Let's sing that chord one more time. There is a land I'm so homesick for though I've never seen it before. I've got loved ones waiting on that shore. [Music] And it's not a million miles away or on some far off distance. Oh, I'll speed up and slow down. There is a lamb. [Music] [Music] [Music] Who can satisfy ify my soul like you. Who on earth could comfort me? Oh, and love me like you do. Who could ever be more faithful and true? I will trust in you. Yes, I will trust in you, my God. who can satisfy my soul like you only do [Music] faithful and true. I will trust in you. I will trust in you my God. There is a mountain. [Applause] Who is the king, [Applause] victorious warrior and lord of everything. I run my shelter. I redeemer blessed redeemer who reign more faithful and true. Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. [Applause] [Music] for you. I find myself here. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. There is a fountain. There is a king victorious warrior and lord of everything. I myself he's the carame. [Applause] I cannot imagine when the millions of voices of the children of God gather in that great today and they begin to sing and worship and praise and the angels of God will just have to bow their heads and back out are the children of the most high begin to sing songs that only they can understand. as we looked at it here Wednesday night, that God actually is using the angels to as they would minister to the saints of God and those that are heirs of righteousness. And yet God is using the church to put on a theater. theater. &gt;&gt; Paul uses the word spectacle that we are a spectacle to men, to the world, and to angels. And the word spectacle is a theater. So God by his grace and mercy is working through our lives and people around the world. And the angels are watching the theater as God does it. &gt;&gt; Wow. because they simply don't understand it. God kept the mystery of redemption from the angels. So much of what is going on and has been going on through the church ages, they're having to watch the people of God and catch it as it's going on. I've often wondered what it must have been like in March of 1963 whenever the lamb is taking the book and opening the seals. Now remember, brother Brandham was not the lamb, but it was the lamb doing it. And the angels for their first time were hearing things they had wondered about and pondered about for thousands and thousands of years. Isn't that awesome? &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's such an honor for us to be gathered together today. Let's turn if you would to second Peter chapter 1 verse two. Hope you're not getting tired of reading these same verses of scripture. No. &gt;&gt; Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. I love this verse here as according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness. and not the world, not sinful pleasure, not things like that, but all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature. You see, that's where angels miss it. They cannot partake of the divine nature the way you do. Having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness. Wonder why that's the last one. Brotherly kindness. Brotherly kindness is the last one before the capstone. &gt;&gt; And to brotherly kindness, charity. I may let them be remembered today as we pray. Me as well. Lord Jesus, we so thank you, Father, that we're able to assemble ourselves together. Lord, as I was over here this week doing some work around the place and standing up there at the playground and just looking down toward our our facility that you've given us and Lord, tears running down my face and just so thankful in my heart that you've let us have a place that we can assemble together and Lord, not only for us but for others have special meetings and different things that we can do to invite friends and brothers and sisters to come and partake with us. We're just so grateful for all that you mean to us. Lord, we pray today, Lord God, that you would help us as we're looking at the building blocks of the tabernacle of God, that which is being worked upon now for a couple of thousand years and the Gentile dispensation. And we know with any building that is being built that there can be visible parts that are done that show such great change. And yet we also know those of us that have built homes and things like that and we've seen construction and once the framing goes up it just seems like it can fly and make such changes. Then the roof. Yes. What great changes. Then when it goes to the inside, the wiring, the insulation, different things, the plumbing, it's in the walls, and you go in and look at it and think, \"What have they even done today? What have them sorry guys been doing? They ain't hardly done nothing.\" I wonder, Lord, if it's not that way with us sometimes in our spiritual building, there's fast parts. There's parts that you do in our lives and it's so noticeable. Yeah. There's other parts that you're doing that no one may not even know anything about it but us. But we know those things are essential. Help us today, Father, as we look into your word in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. God bless you, saints. You may be seated. Aren't you glad he's still working on you? &gt;&gt; Yes. Boy, am I glad he didn't give up on me. A long time ago, I'm sure that for each of us, we've not only experienced the grace of God when we were first saved, but we've experienced it many, many times since we got saved because God knows we need it every day of our life. So, godliness means to be like God. But in what way? How can mere mortals which are uh imperfect, flawed and have all kinds of faults and shortcomings even to the even after they become born again. How can they be like God? How could they ever be even expected or for he himself to require them to be like him to be godly or to have godliness in their lives? And yet we know he's not asking us to do anything that is not attainable by his power being inside of us. He's not that kind of a God that would ever require such things that he knew that we could never do. But he also knows that by being partakers of the divine nature, that within itself, just as your mother and father and your family, and some of you probably can look at certain features in your hands, your face, your ears, your nose, whatever it is, and you look just like your daddy, just like your mama, whether you like it or not, it's just the way that it is. And you didn't ask to be that way. You didn't actually choose to be that way, but it was given to you through the mixing of the 23 chromosomes from your mother, the 23 from your father, and then the embedded DNA that is there. It just automatically comes out. Well, we know then by being partakers of the divine nature that there's some things and they'll show up immediately whenever we are born again. Other things, boy, it can take years before we really start seeing them manifested in our life. But that's the greater work because every day we are displaying the mercy and the grace of God as he's working in our lives. And even whenever we think oursel, I'm at a standstill. Anybody ever get there in your walk with God to where you just feel like, you know what, boy? I mean, I was really growing and I was doing this or that, but it's very similar to construction. Once we got the walls up on this place here, the people that passed by, they didn't have a clue, you know, what we were doing on the inside, but there was so much to be done on the inside. Same way with your house, if you ever built one. Same way with the house of God. For many of you, you've already straightened up on the outside. People can look at you, see your hair, clothes you wear, things that you do. And some of you may not look one bit different right now than you look 20 years ago or 25 years ago, except maybe a little bit fatter and a little bit uglier. Other than that, you know, you look the same. As you as you increase in size, your dress sizes get bigger. Excuse me. There and you know those things on the outside. But what about the inside? What about the inside? And you see that's the part that can become so difficult. Jeremiah said that the human heart when he talked about the heart how corrupt and how who who who can even know it. He said the human heart and the human heart can have things that are so embedded so deep in it that even your closest friends. Have you ever been shocked and surprised by people that you thought you knew and you thought you knew them so well? Oh my goodness. And you heard this or that or the other name. No, no way. No way they would ever be like that. Come to find out they were. Why? Because it was embedded so deep inside of them. And the heart is a very treacherous, dangerous thing. Only God can change that. You can change your appearance yourself on the outside, but only God could go into the heart. Now, this is some of the spiritual building blocks that God is building and making his people into. And when I look at this one of godliness, Carol, I was talking about the other day and I told her that I I don't mind telling you that I've been the most surprised by this one of all of them that we've looked at so far as far as the things that the Lord has opened in his word and allowed us to be able to look into and see to to help us to be like him. And today we'd like to look at another one of those if God will help us in an attribute of godliness. Now I realize it's probably going to shock you whenever I mention it to you, but what we want to look at today is going to church. &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Who would have ever thought going to church would make you godly? Shall we read Luke 4 verse 16? And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, you mean to tell me Jesus went to church? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't even an apostolic church. Mhm. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a Methodist church. It was a synagogue. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you all know how they worshiped in the synagogue services. Well, I read through them again yesterday to look at it historically. It sounded pretty boring to me. So, they read part of Leviticus. They read part of Deuteronomy. They go through a bunch of things and it was the same thing over and over and over again. The same words. They would read the same words, the same portion of scriptures. And then of course they would have songs. It was the same thing over and over and over again. And yet Jesus went to church. &gt;&gt; Now look at this. And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, well, I'll tell you one thing. If Jesus custom was to go to church, it's mine, too. &gt;&gt; Now, I realize that there's people who would love to be able to go to church, but they can't do it because they're physically unable or there's not a church to where they can go. And those of you, and I hear from them every time that I that I deal with this, those that stream the service, \"Oh, brother Donnie, what are we going to do? We ain't got a church to go. Now remember, this is people for for people who feel like they do not need to go to church or simply don't believe in it. But it's also for us who are regular churchgoers so that hopefully we will be able to see even greater why we go to church and what we should do when we get to church. So just going to church and showing up and being there is not all the Lord wants us to do. So now think of it going to a synagogue. Now remember there's only one temple but in lots of different outlying s places in Jerusale around side of Jerusalem in the land of Israel they would have a synagogue. Even today there is no temple but anywhere you find a Jewish community a very large one you're going to find a synagogue. So, a synagogue, they would have a certain portion of that. They would read the Torah, they would sing, they would do these different things. And then they'd also have like a fellowship hall, a fellowship building. Those of you that's been around, you've seen what they're made like. And this is sort of what it was. So, it was sort of a a common type of a place. Carol and I stood a few years ago and stood right on the very rocks of the synagogue that the Lord Jesus would have went into whenever this scripture would have been fulfilled. So it was like a community type of building but only for the Jews. So they would use it as a multi-purpose type place. They did not offer sacrifices. Remember, they read the law, they discussed the law, and whenever a boy came into his bar mitzvah, he was 12 years old. It was the first time that he was able to stand publicly. Remember, public worship has always been a great thing to God. So, their bar mitzvah was not in private. Their bar mitzvah was not away from everybody else, but it was in public. It was a public celebration. So the boy 12 years old, he comes before them and the priest hands him the scroll and he would turn there and read. Now according to them at 12 years old, he became a man. He was a man in the sense of that he could be able to read the Torah and be able to start commenting on what it was and what it meant. So here the Lord Jesus would have actually went to the synagogue at the age of 12 years old whenever he had have been allowed to read the Torah. But he didn't start going to church when he was 12. As a matter of fact, he went at the day of his dedication. You remember that? But his mother and stepfather would have taken him over and over and over again to church. So God went to church. &gt;&gt; Now to be like God, guess what? &gt;&gt; You and I need to go to church. &gt;&gt; Wow. My now you think this is an attribute of godliness that an element of message people will never attain to because they see no need whatsoever to go to church. They just don't do it. And they say, \"Well, you know, you can't get very much truth there.\" Now, I want you to think 2,000 years ago and the setting, the scenario that would have been there. It was the same thing at every service over and over again, you knew exactly what scriptures they was going to read. You knew exactly some of the same things that the priest was going to say. So, there would have been hardly no spirituality in those services at all. There would have been no life, no spiritual life, no revelation. There would have been no preaching, no anointed men of God saying, \"I feel led to go this way. The Lord changed my subject. I feel led.\" No, there was none of that at all. And Jesus went every time the doors was open. &gt;&gt; Now, think of how little truth that they had. You imagine they never seen a miracle their entire life. Jesus as a young boy going to church never saw a miracle. Jesus going to church never heard a Holy Ghostfilled anointed preacher stand up and preach the word. &gt;&gt; But it was men that were trained cold formal theological And Jesus went to church every time the doors is open. &gt;&gt; You got to be kidding me. To that kind of a church. &gt;&gt; And yet Jesus made it regular part of his life. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Now you know people use excuse. Well, I I don't always agree with everything that's preached. &gt;&gt; So you think he did? Now, if that would excuse you from going to church, then it should have excused the Lord Jesus. And after you got to be a young man, you can say, \"You know what, mama? I don't want to go back no more. I mean, I know everything they're going to say before they say it. I I know what they're going to read. I know what they're going to do. We've been doing this for all of these years, and I really have no desire to go.\" Oh, but you see, God goes to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was no life, no new births, nobody received the Holy Ghost, nobody got healed, no deliverances, no miracles. And Jesus kept right on going to church. &gt;&gt; Why? God. So Jesus was actually known, and I love the way that Luke catches this. He's the only one of the four writers of the four gospels. And he actually places Jesus an element about Jesus human life. And I absolutely love it because he places Jesus in the scripture as being habitual when it come to going to church and being a worshshiper. So Jesus didn't just attend church, but Jesus was a worshipper in church. Now, he might have been one of the very few that actually did, you know, the rest of them, yes, praise Yahweh, hallelujah, Adonai, this, that, and the other. But can you imagine the Lord Jesus going to church? He worshiped. He praised. Hallelujah. Oh my. I mean, I kind of figured y'all would look at me strange, but I didn't think he'd look at me this strange this long. So, I'm hoping it'll pass, you know, here momentarily. So Jesus was an habitual church attender and he was also an habitual worshipper that every time he went to the house of God. Now what what a an absolute rebuke for those who in Christianity who say well I know what they're going to do. They're going to start at 10:00 or like us 11:00. Brother Lou is going to get up there and he's going to mess up saying this and you know the song leader is going to do this and whoever's going to sing that. Somebody's going to mess up on the sound system cuz they always do. Whoever turns up that air conditioner, they're absolutely freezing me to death. And somebody else on the other side of the church going through the change of life and they got 47 fans while they're sitting there flying. I know what brother Donny's good. He's going to read quotes. He's going to do this. You'd have had a hard time going to Jesus church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So you see, it's not just the church and it's not just what everybody else is doing. The question is, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; When you come to church, &gt;&gt; you see, it's not about it being worked around the way you like church. It's not the way you like church. It's not really even the way I like church. It's the way God wants it. That's what we want to do is to be able to please him. Now imagine the corruption and the rottness of doctrine &gt;&gt; that was during this first century. Now it wouldn't that be an excuse to stay home. There would have been hardly any purity of truth and doctrine that he would have heard had they commented on it. It's easy to see they didn't have an understanding because there he was right among them and they never did know who he was and they still don't many of them. &gt;&gt; But wouldn't that be a reason to stay home? I said, \"Well, they're blind. They don't know who I am. I ain't going up that bunch of blind bunch of people.\" Can't you see friends this attribute of God? &gt;&gt; This attribute of God is so valuable and so important. And yet so many message people ridicule it. dishonoring the resurrection every week &gt;&gt; and staying home and going shopping and listening to a tape and then go out and spend the rest of the day doing this and that and the other, whatever it is they do. &gt;&gt; Now, think of it. Either we have this or we don't go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I don't understand people who don't go to church. &gt;&gt; They choose not to. I mean, and why they ever want to go to heaven? &gt;&gt; Cuz I mean, it's like church every day. &gt;&gt; So, if you can't go a couple of times a week, you'd never enjoy being to heaven. &gt;&gt; So, there would have been such corruption doctrinally. There would have been such blindness. You would have hardly heard any revelation at all unless Simeon would have come through every now and then. Now, if Simeon would have come there every now and then, he'd probably whenever they'd write read, you know, some of these scriptures of Isaiah 7:14 and, you know, Isaiah 35:3 and Zechariah 6:12 and Deuteronomy 18:15, uh, Genesis 3:15-18. And if they read some of them, hit say, \"Glory.\" Of course, the deacons about, calm down, oh man, you're interrupting the preach. Oh, glory to God. I'll tell you one thing. Hallelujah. I'm going to see that baby born. They'd probably say, \"Poor old guy. He's just got dementia or something. You know, he don't know where he's at.\" But most part, the rest of them just sat there and sleep. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; And they couldn't wait till church was over so they could talk about how many sheep they had, how many goats they had, how many horses, how many she assasses and camels, and how much money they made that week. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You know, it's amazing because all it's done is changed from sheep now to palladium or gold or silver or chrome &gt;&gt; or real estate. People haven't really changed that much, have they? &gt;&gt; So, there would have been such corruption and such rottness, but that had no effect whatsoever on the Lord Jesus going to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You mean he went to church when there was nobody with revelation? Absolutely. He went to church when they was as blind as they could be. Absolutely. They done the same thing over and over again and he went back every time the doors is open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was his custom. It was his custom. So, this is something that Where's Jesus at? Well, what time is it? It's on the Sabbath. I know exactly where he's at. He's in church. Well, wouldn't that be something to be said about us? My my. You see, there was nothing that would keep him away as far as what most people would use for excuses today from going to church. He went anyway to the house of God. Now I hope that you understand by bringing it this way that it is actually our duty as sons and daughters of God to attend church regularly. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Regularly and that much more. Paul says as we see the day approaching. Now notice that it is better. It would be actually better to go to a place where their doctrine is not 100% accurate and they might have a little bit of formality in their worship if they have any worship or they could be on the other side. They could be a little radic and they could be a little Pentecostal in their worship. But it would be better to do that and go and you give your all in that service than it would be to stay at home by yourself. You say, \"How could you say that?\" By the living word, the way he lived. How did he live? Did he find a perfect church? There were none. Come on, somebody. There were no perfect churches. There wasn't even none after the Holy Ghost come on the day of Pentecost. We can read the epistles of Paul and realize they all had their issues. And every message church in this day has its issues. Every message church has its problems. Every message individual has their problems. Whether Americans, whether they're Africans, whether they're Tennessans or Texans or wherever they're from, they have their issues. But to me, it is still my responsibility and my duty to go to the house of God and not just sit there like a bump on a pickle, but when I get there, I am going to worship. I'm going to sing. I'm going to clap my hands. I'm going to praise. That's who I am. &gt;&gt; Now notice even though now people look at well there's no churches around nowhere where the doctrine I 100% agree with them. I'll tell you one thing. I'd be better off to stay away from them. You're not following the pattern that Jesus followed. As a matter of fact, someone was telling me not long ago of a man that attended our church years ago and and he he went to one church and another church and another church and finally just ah then none of them churches ain't none of them you know on the word but yet he was witnessing to someone about the message and he was witnessing to a businessman and he said yeah have you ever heard God son a prophet no and the guy was a little bit curious about it you know so he started talking talking to him about this uh you know about this message. My goodness, he said some I've never even heard it before in my life. So the farther they went along and talking and so this man asked him and said, \"So where do you go to church at?\" He said, \"Oh, I I don't go to any church.\" Well, aren't there some churches around your Yeah, but I don't go to any of them because I I don't agree with any of them. You know what the man done that he's trying to convert? Said, \"You know what, sir? You need to be in church somewhere. So you're trying to tell me you've got more light than I do and you don't even go to church. Now you're talking about a slap in that man's face of his testimony. And the sad part about it is that denominational man he was talking to was better off than that message man was. You know why? Cuz he's so arrogant, so puffed up and he's not doing what Jesus done. Now Jesus could have stood outside the doors at every service he went. He could have critiqued this and throwed off on that. Said that was a lie. That wasn't true. And Jesus could have made every service turned it into total chaos. But instead of doing that, Jesus kept on going back to church. You imagine as a little boy, the little boy Jesus would stand back go adonai, adoni, Elohim, Adonai. He would worship and he become a teenager and Jesus would pray and Jesus would worship and he'd stand there as he'd hold the Torah when he was 13 years old and his little locks around his head and he would stand there like that. Oh, Adonai. Adonai, Adoni. And they always knew Jesus was in church because you saw him and you could hear him. Hallelujah. I ain't much of a silent worshipper. I ain't much. Come on, somebody. I realize there's a time, but I'll tell you one thing. I I believe when we come to the house of God, if we ever express our feelings, our emotions, everything that we are, it should be toward the living God. People want silent prayer and silent specials and silent preachers. Where in the world do you get that at in God's word? Lift up your voices. The Bible says, \"Lift up your hands. Clap your hands. All you people shout with the voice of triumph to the Lord. If you'd shout at a volleyball game or a baseball game or a basketball game and won't lift your voice to the Lord Jesus, I say shame on you. I said shame on you. Let it be our custom, hallelujah, that we not only go to the house of God, but we worship when we're there. We say amen to the word and when it cuts us we say Lord help us. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You imagine the doctrines were not pure and the service Jesus never attended a service that was perfect. &gt;&gt; But he went to church every time the doors is open. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now wonder why he would do that. So then where are people who just refuse to go to church? I'm talking about message people who claim they're in a more revelated state of the light. Where do they get their example to stay home? &gt;&gt; Well, it's not from Jesus &gt;&gt; and it's not from the apostles. And it's not from our prophet. &gt;&gt; Say it. &gt;&gt; So could it be it's from this guy? [Music] &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Now he goes to church, &gt;&gt; but he don't go to worship God. &gt;&gt; The devil goes to church and demons go to church. &gt;&gt; But they don't go to worship God. &gt;&gt; They don't go to get anything out of the service. They go to pick. I don't like this. I don't like that. That wasn't the way I wanted it. That wasn't the way I wanted it. And then they come with that attitude and then they'll get on people that will let them get on them. &gt;&gt; I don't want them devils on me. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Have I ever been in a perfect service? Never in all my life. I've probably been in more than most of you all have. And I've sometimes, you know, you're going through, boy, I wish that was better. I wish that was better. I wish they hadn't said that. I wish I hadn't said that. But you know what you do? You keep on going back and saying, \"Praise God, Lord. Maybe I'm the one that's out of tune. Maybe I'm the one that needs help.\" Come on, saints. &gt;&gt; Now, do we want to be like God or not? &gt;&gt; Well, God, &gt;&gt; you see, it's always been of vast importance to God that worship was displayed in a public manner. Public manner. So, and it's also our responsibility to not only come to the house of God, but also assist and make sure that our children understand the value so that if all of us older people die and the next generation, they'll sell this building here and they say, \"We don't go to church.\" That's up to you parents to instill the value and the importance in your children's life of going to church. &gt;&gt; Question answer is 1964 a sister asked brother Brandham. She said that she believed the message and her son with her believed the message and received it. But her husband went to a denominational church and he started talking to their son. I'll just brief this part. You can read it if you like. And they started he started talking to her son and he pulled him away from following the message as well. And then the sister tells that her husband wants her to go to church with her with him rather. And she asked the question should she go to church with her husband. This isn't the answer. Go with your husband, but don't be partakers of what they're doing. See, you're supposed to love your husband, and love is what does it. You just be real salty and he'll get thirsty if there's anything in him. Don't join their denomination. You said stay away from that denomination, which is part of the sister's question. Don't join it. Go to it. If you can't get a whole loaf, get a half. &gt;&gt; If you can't get a half, get a slice. &gt;&gt; Let me break it on down. If you can't get a slice, get a crumb. If you can't get a crumb, get a smell. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If you want to go to church, you'll find something good to go for. Now, &gt;&gt; I know y'all think I'm nuts anyway. But I'm going to tell you one thing. If I lived in a community where there was nothing there but a Baptist church or a Methodist church or whatever it was, I would do my best to go at least every now and then just to let the devil know I still profess to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because there's something about public identification that you're not ashamed of your God. You're not ashamed of being recognized that you are a Christian. They might throw me out because I if I'm going I am going to worship. I'm going to worship. I'm going to praise. I ain't going to sit there. I'm going to bless the name of my God. He's done so much for me. I've got so much to thank him for. Now, I want you to notice how that brother Brennham takes this and he said, \"But that's the way you win your husband.\" That by doing that, don't be arrogant. &gt;&gt; Why? Why would he throw that in now to a message believer? &gt;&gt; Does that tend to go with message believers? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; In the way they look at others. That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't be arrogant and he'll know he's got just as much as you have. &gt;&gt; So you mean a denominational believer would have just as much as a message believer if the message believer has an understanding of the message, but with it they got an arrogant spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Talk to us Jesus. &gt;&gt; Talk to us Jesus. But when you can show something that you have that he don't have, that'll make him thirst to be like you. Wow. Godliness. Don't you want so much of God in your life that other people will long to be like you? I'll never forget it. I don't think as long as I live. Let me scan the audience. Yeah. Okay. I'll see them. There was there was a several years ago at the other place. There was a man and his wife come up and they're here this morning. They come up and and and the the the sister says she hadn't made the full commitment yet to the Lord. Uh but I'd been watching the spirit of God deal with her for a while. And as she come up there, standing right by her husband, and she told me, \"I want what he's got.\" Now, her mother and daddy's here today. They're godly people. Family members here today, godly people. I hope I was a godly pastor. &gt;&gt; But she didn't say she wanted what I had. &gt;&gt; She didn't say she wanted what her mama had, what her daddy had. Not discrediting that. But who was it that had made such an impact upon her life? Her husband. Brothers, that's the kind of husbands we want to be. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Can you amen say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of wives that you wives want to be. Now, here the prophet reversed around. It was a sister. So, the prophet is teaching this message woman how to be able to live the message every day in such a way that her Methodist I wasn't going to call it, but that's what he was. So that her Methodist husband would be able to hunger and thirst after what she had. Brother, sister, when the message of the hour does that in our lives, then let's share that. We want to share a bunch of theology and share this and that and the other. Let's wait till we get a good dose of the Holy Ghost before we go to try to telling people about Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. And trying to do go to service again. The prophet said, \"People think that I don't even believe in people going to church. That's a million miles from the truth. &gt;&gt; Not a half a mile, not a quarter of a mile, not two miles, a million miles. So those in the message who oh my who propagate this, who proclaim it, who like to set it forth, you are a million miles according to the very tapes that you listen to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From the truth. We &gt;&gt; must &gt;&gt; what? &gt;&gt; I can show you where he said we must assemble ourselves together, but I cannot show you where he said &gt;&gt; he said &gt;&gt; we must play his tapes when we come to church. Come on. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, are we going to say what he said? No, we're not. A lot of us are not going to say it. We're going to say what we like that he said and what we don't like, we ain't going to say it. &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody. I don't know about you this morning. I want to say it whether I like it or whether I don't. There's things he said that burns me up. There's things he said that sets me on fire. But I say, \"Amen.\" Lord, help me to move up. Help me to move up. Come on, somebody. Let's have church this morning. There's things that he said. Boy, I can. Amen. Hallelujah. But you can tell a lot of people ain't guilty of that cuz that amen comes out when it's really coming across to them. They sat there and that bottom lip pooches out like I don't know what. And you know they're guilty as a hound dog in the hen house. But a real saint of God can say, \"Lord, help me. Help me. Lord, I want to move up.\" Come on, children. Why do we come to the house of God? The prophet said, \"We come to church to find our faults. We come to church to hear our shortcomings.\" Why? So the gospel can come forth and straighten us out and get us ready to leave this world. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We must assemble ourselves together and that much more as we see the day approaching. See, we must &gt;&gt; It is &gt;&gt; come together in unity. If I lived in a city and they had nothing there, well, some church, I don't want to call any name, but any church, if they only believe one thing, &gt;&gt; that Jesus was divine and all the rest of it was wrong. &gt;&gt; I'd go to that church. &gt;&gt; Why? He understood the importance of assembling yourselves together. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If I can't get a whole loaf of bread, I'll take a slice. I'll go listen and worship the Lord and show him. Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh, you mean so those who don't go to church aren't showing him? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They're doing their part. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; Godliness. &gt;&gt; Godliness. &gt;&gt; To be like God. and he wants to be like God. &gt;&gt; All right. Remember, your hand will answer to you at the dead of judgment. Now, notice I want to show him that I'm doing my part. I want him to know that I'm alive. Well, can't he know that you're alive when you're staying home listening to a tape 12:00 Eastern time all around the world? Can't he know that you refuse? I know, friends, you look at me like I've got a ward on the side of my head, but you don't understand what's going on around this message around the world. This this movie is gaining momentum everywhere. People staying at home, people leaving churches, people falling out with one another. Best of friends that have been friends for years and years. And yet they're saying, \"If you go hear a preacher preach, you ain't hearing the perfect voice of God. I will not go. I'm staying home.\" You're breaking what the very prophet of God taught. Excuse me. Now listen what he said about going to church publicly. actually what it does. I want him to know that I'm alive, but I want everybody to know what side I'm on. And how you going to do that, brother Brennham? By going to church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want everybody to know what side I'm on. I assemble with the Christians and their worship and serve the Lord. Oh, why? Why? What was the necessity of going to church? God loves to go to church. &gt;&gt; God loves to come together with his children and let them worship him. &gt;&gt; Well, can't you worship him at home? Yes, I do. Every day of my life, I worship God every day of my life. Every night, every morning, noon time, I worship him. Every day of my life, I don't wait to come to church to worship him. My life is worship. &gt;&gt; My life is a worship and an offering unto my God. You understand? I hope you all do the same thing. You should look every moment that you have time. Well, what am I going to thank him for? What about life? What about breast? What about sanity? What about the clothes you got on your back? What about the breakfast that you ate, the water that you drink, the sunshine that he allows to come upon the oxygen that he gives you, a home church, a pastor that loves you, brothers and sisters, a resurrection and rapture, faith, hope, mercy, goodness, kindness, generally. You want me to go on? Have you got enough wrote down? You've got enough to praise him for. You should never stop praising him. But I'm going through so much stuff. And it'll be him that'll bring you through the stuff you're going through. He's the one who will give you victory. He's the one who's brought you safe thus far. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 16:18, the very first time this word is used in the New Testament, and the founder of the church is the one who uses it. And I say unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church. Ecclesia, ecclesia, assembly, a gathering of citizens called out from their &gt;&gt; glory. &gt;&gt; Called out from their homes into some That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Now, this is what the founder said. &gt;&gt; It's not up for debate. &gt;&gt; Called out from their homes into some public place, an assembly of the people convened again at the public place of the council for the purpose of deliberating. That's what I'm doing this morning, deliberating. Why? Why can't we do that at home? I guess so. I suppose if that's what Jesus wanted, he could have used another word. But this one is the one he used to describe his bride. &gt;&gt; And it just so happens I believe I'm part of it. So, as long as I'm physically able and if I get too old to come anymore, y'all can't roll me in a wheelchair. And if I've got a stream, me and Carol will sit side by side and hold hands in the wheelchair and we'll shout in our wheelchair. May not be able to move from the half of the body up. But I'm going to do whatever I can. If I come to church and I'm 85 or 90 and I fall asleep, have a little pity on me and somebody gouge me on the side if I go to sleep. But please bring me to the house of God. If I get to where I was like John was, and they had to pack him to the house of God, but John said, \"I've got to go to church. I've got to go to church now. have got to be in the presence of God. But it's not just the presence of God. It's the presence of God's children. People that you're going to spend eternity with. In this presence today is healing. In this house is deliverance. In this house, no matter what you need of, it is here today with the people of God. Hebrews chap 10 24. Now Paul was addressing this issue of going to church in his day. Now I want you to get the setting of it. He tells them in the next verse down here not to forsake the assembling of themselves together. So there was a temptation not to go to church in this time frame in the first first century. But you realize it wasn't Dollywood and it was why we got a picnic up on Rome Mountain and we'll skip church today. Come to church and then do your picnic at Rome Mountain. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. But the Romans was following to their churches and they would go in and raid the services &gt;&gt; and take people out and cut their heads off. Pregnant women had their bellies ripped open and their babies jerked out of their belly and dashed their brains against rocks. They were being burned at the stake. So they would follow them to church to know whether they met. Was they going to the grocery store? Actually, if you laid out of church and went to the grocery store, they let you live. &gt;&gt; But you know who they got? Those that went to church. &gt;&gt; And they knew them first century Christians that was filled with the Holy Ghost went to church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But this fear, this fear had got among them and part of them had got so afraid. Now brothers, think of it. You're the protectors of your home. How hard it would be, brother Joel. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For us to know if we pulled up to Word of Life Church and the police, state troopers, the militia, the military would be standing out there. All right. Get their name, get their ID, get their license plate. We'll be contacting you this week. &gt;&gt; Why? What have I done wrong? You come to church. &gt;&gt; Wonder if it have enough left to pay the electric bill. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think of what these Christians were facing. &gt;&gt; And yet in the face of that, Paul said, \"Forsake not the assembling &gt;&gt; of yourselves together.\" Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine, my friends, the judgment of God that will await some of these message people? They're facing none of that. &gt;&gt; But they're under a lie of hell. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when them first century Christians walk up there as a testimony against the modernday Leodysian message people &gt;&gt; that could drive to a house of God right down the road, right up the road, whatever. I don't want to go. I don't like that. I don't like that. They're not playing tapes. They're not doing this. God have mercy on your soul. &gt;&gt; Now, notice how he addresses this in verse 24 before he says, \"Forsake not as simming of yourselves together in 25.\" Let us consider one another. So, you see, fellowship with God should never wind up being selfishness on our part. Well, I'm going to church because I want this and I need that and I this and I that. Paul is wanting them to get it straight the reason they go to church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works. So you mean the leoty, the Christian believers can actually provoke one another to love and to good works? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; So you come to church and you you see brother so and so ain't been there and his wife and their children have been there. You you well I'll pray for him. That's the deacon's responsibility. It might be your responsibility just as well to check on them and say, \"Hey, y'all doing okay? We've been missing you. We want you to know we love you and we're here to do anything that we can to help you. Are y'all y'all okay? We love you. This is what your Bible says. &gt;&gt; Provoke them to good works. Now, why you imagine the saints of God when they got this letter and they said, \"Oh, I don't should we tell brother so and so and sister so and so, I know she's got a newborn and and that they're scared to come to church.\" They're afraid. Children, look how spoiled we are. If we wanted to, we could have church every night of the week. &gt;&gt; You could come here daily and pray, you could do whatever you want. Oh my, how would we have acted in that age to where our very life and the preachers makes you wonder how many preachers we'd have today? &gt;&gt; I'm talking about real God ones. &gt;&gt; And they knew while they were standing up there that they could be taken straight to jail. Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works. You see, we fellowship and we meet together not just for God and for us, but for one another. I find it amazing that the emphasis is not just put on what you get out of church. That's right. But it's on you helping others &gt;&gt; and you ministering to others. You see faithfulness in church attendance, especially when you're down &gt;&gt; and when you're low, &gt;&gt; you lose a loved one and you don't want to come back to church for a while because you don't want people asking you how you doing and what's going on. &gt;&gt; And yet I've seen some of you come in here and sat down and I knew your heart was broken. And humanly you'd rather stayed away for a bit cuz you knew everybody's going to come. How you doing? How you doing? And you come home anyway. You know what that did to us? That so encouraged us. &gt;&gt; That so helped us that in your pain. Well, you could have stayed. Sure. You could have stayed and streamed the service and sat outside in your car until it come time for me to get up and preach and then you dart in the door and as soon as I pray, you're gone. cuz you don't want to you don't want to shake nobody's hand. What kind of yellowbellied coward is that? Come to the house of God. Get in there before the singing starts. Sit down, concentrate, meditate. Amen, brother Donnie. Preach. Read your Bible. Sit there. Sing with the saints. I don't want just the devil to know I'm identified with preaching. I want the devil to know I'm identified with the singing part of the service. I'm identified with the prayer request part of the service. Come on, somebody. There ain't going to be no preaching in heaven, but there's going to be a whole lot of singing going on if I'm going to be identified with the singing there. I'm going to sing here. I know I can't carry a tune in a large bucket, but I'm going to carry it as well as I can. I may battle out off keys sometime, but I want God to know what side I'm on. If the devil, oh my, can his people can do what they do? What about us as the children of God? Off key, on key, no key, middle key, we ought to sing. We ought to clap our hand. We ought to amen the preacher. We ought to come and bring our presence even when we don't feel like it. Why? It encourages others. &gt;&gt; You want to know one of the most discouraging things a pastor can deal with? &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; people not attending church. So for some of these sermons that I study for, ask my wife, she knows how much I study. Ask my family. They come up to eat with us and I'll say, \"I got to go. I got to go study.\" I may look at a thousand quotes and scriptures for one Sunday morning service. Hours and hours and hours and hours and hours. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; And people come in, run in and out, sleep. Some don't even show up. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you and let hell know it. If there ain't nobody here Wednesday night but me and Carol, I'm still preaching what God's put on my heart. I'm not letting my joy be affected by the devil, but it sure ain't going to work very good for you. You encourage me. You encourage every man of God that gets up there. It makes it worth the effort. Oh, come on, somebody. We are here not to live for ourself &gt;&gt; but live for others. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You imagine brother Joel this must have been a hard verse to write. Now you there's no way you and I can understand the responsibility brother Harvey that Paul must have felt when he wrote this knowing that what if he writes this and somebody comes to church and they lose their life &gt;&gt; that very night and he's the one who told them to come to the house of God. &gt;&gt; But Paul deemed it worth it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What a better way to go. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together, as the manner of some is. Now notice the word forsaking. Read it there. Leave, abandon, desert. Do you understand all these folks around the message that have quit going to church, they are deserters in the army of God? &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. &gt;&gt; They have deserted their post of duty. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Imagine the brand tabernacle setting empty this morning &gt;&gt; and has for years. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God have mercy. The prophet told us, remember, one day this tabernacle &gt;&gt; will lose its strength. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And it has. &gt;&gt; Is that going to be our pattern? &gt;&gt; Are we going to follow that? Is that what we want? That's not what I believe the message was sent for. The message was sent to restore the hearts of the children back to the faith of the original apostolic fathers. But why do they do this or under deception of the devil? Come on, somebody. That's exactly right. And they don't believe that brother Brandham came to restore that word. No way. They believe this message is something totally new. Well, if you make Brother Brener bringing something totally new, then you are making him a false prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Only a false prophet brings new things that are contrary to the written word of God. And if brother Brandham would have preached things contrary to that Bible, I could not follow this message. I would not have gi my all. But I hear his message and I look in the Bible and I see it saying the same thing. So what am I going to do? I'm going to give all that I have to this word. I'm going to give all of my life to this word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Forsake, leave, abandon, desert, leave in straits, leave helpless. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the people in that community in the Brandham Tabernacle when they passed by going to their church here or there and there and there it sits empty. Someone told me not long ago they up there and they actually went in to see it and it smelled moldy. You can go in all right and have silent prayer. Where's that at in the Bible? Do we want mold on our walls? &gt;&gt; Why is there mold on the walls? Cuz there's mold in their souls. &gt;&gt; They're not saying what God's prophet said. They're not saying what the Bible said. &gt;&gt; Well, you don't say. Don't just sit here and scream amen to it. And if you don't come to church the way you ought to come to church, you ain't doing it neither. Well, preach, Brother Donnie. I don't want to just say amen to it. I want to Amen. I'm going to let my feet do the amen and two. I'm going to get up and put my clothes on and come to the house of God and sing and pray and worship and magnify the name of our God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Desert, leave, &gt;&gt; leave helpless. totally abandoned. So this is the word that Paul chose to use because some of the saints of God was fearing for their lives, &gt;&gt; not laziness and slothfulness. Their lives was at stake going to church. But Paul was saying, \"Children, I know it's hard. I know it's scary for you, but you got to keep going to church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Totally abandoned, utterly forsaken. God have mercy on those that are responsible for turning that tabernacle into a molded rundown building. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Where Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; sent his anointing and his angels there to bring messages like the world had never heard before. healings, miracles, signs, wonders, the word of God, Christ Jesus himself, come there in that last week of March and tore those seals open and reveal those seals, things that have been hid since the foundation of the world. And now it sits there shut up. It is the duty of the saints of God to assemble &gt;&gt; together for public worship. Who says Godmen? &gt;&gt; He wants it done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; As the manner of some is. So, here's some of those dear saints, brother Rob. So, here is Paul is identifying said some of them it's become habitual. They're just afraid to go to church anymore. &gt;&gt; And Paul said, \"Now look, children, you can't do that.\" Well, why don't they tell them, \"Why don't we take a sabbatical? I'll tell you what, we'll shut the churches down for about 6 months or a year or something like that. And once this persecution thing is over, once people are Christians or, you know, that they're going to give them a break, no doubt in time. And once this is all over, we'll all come back together. And how many will you have left?\" &gt;&gt; Amen. We've seen what the devil done to us in the COVID shutdown. &gt;&gt; Ain't talking about us just the message as a church. I'm talking about the message around the world. And yet one of the main leaders of it said CO was one of the greatest things that ever happened to the message. How in the world could anybody full of the Holy Ghost say such trash? Brother Donnie. Yes. Rubbish of the devil. When God's word tells us to come together and somebody said it's the greatest thing ever was cuz it'll force people to listen to more tapes. You need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say it, Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, so in the times of persecution, the great temptation was, \"Don't stop being a Christian. Don't stop living for God, but just don't go to church.\" And they entered into this dangerous neglect. So Paul tells them to exhort one another. Let's press play this morning, shall we? Except I'll read it to you. Here we go. The breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals. Page 116, paragraph 327. You love him. Isn't he wonderful? Oh, what would we do without this? Man shall not live by bread alone, but every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Now remember where this is preached, breadtham tabernacle, &gt;&gt; the place that today is shut down. &gt;&gt; Oh, feed me Lord upon your word. Forsake not to assemble yourselves together as the manner of unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Not people with a greater revelation. and believers. And it was said in the same building that's sitting empty this morning. God have mercy, children. What will the future hold if the Lord carries and goes on for a few years and I die and go by the way of all men and then it comes up? How many will we have that'll still attend Word of Life Church? Will you so instill it in your children? Children, we've got to go to church. It's imperative that we go. But daddy, the young people ain't kind to me. Then you think they was kind to Jesus. They treated Jesus bad. They run him down. But he said, \"We're going to church today, mama. Get your clothes on. We're going to the house of God.\" Why? God goes to church. That's godliness. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh my The prophet said, \"Many of these poor wandering, straying children stirring around through the world tonight without a church home.\" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Grant, Lord, that they'll see their error. &gt;&gt; And come to the house of the living God. &gt;&gt; And word of Life Church said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us now for we ask it in Jesus name. s of the Christ. And I said, \"You get that bunch of lukewarm church members down there to the altar and let them pray through till the Holy Ghost sets their soul of fire. There's no signing cards.\" He was talking to a pastor now. So he had to get so many people to sign a card to at least show up twice a year, Christmas and Easter. This is Brother Brandham's response to him. You get that bunch of lukewarm church members down there to the altar and let them pray through. I think that's somewhat our message folks need. Till the Holy Ghost sets their soul on fire, there'll be no signing cards. God's in their heart. God goes to church. &gt;&gt; He loves to worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God loves to worship. He don't want us to come to church and suffer like we're half dead. He wants us to worship because God loves to go to church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God to church. He loves to worship. &gt;&gt; So to be godly, we got to worship when we get there. preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, you say, \"How in the world can that be true? That God loves to worship. Who's he worshiping?\" [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Who do you figure? Right. &gt;&gt; Remember the old English vows which used to say and I' I've married a few people &gt;&gt; still with them to this day. With thee my body I thee worship. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With thee my body I the worship. And the Lord God loves to go to church because there he loves to pull his bride in his arms and he loves to anoint her with his presence. He loves to bring healing to her body. He loves Don't you understand? He with his body, oh glory God, he with his body went to the cross and gave his body and he could say it back to us with thee. Oh hallelujah, with my body, I give it to you. You know why you're sitting there dried up like that? You don't understand the meaning of worship. It means to adore. It means to bring one to an elevated level. The Lord Jesus don't want to just come to church with a bunch of cold dead church members, but he wants to have a relationship. He wants to have a love affair, a love affair with every one of his children. And he pulls you in his arms and makes love to you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you. We feel that every person is duty bound &gt;&gt; to attend some church and belong to some church as a Christian. &gt;&gt; Wow. Press play, obey. &gt;&gt; Don't just press play and say nay. &gt;&gt; Press play and obey. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You want to rhyme it out? I can make as many memes as you can. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We feel that every person is duty bound. Does every person mean every person or not? [Applause] Many people say, \"Oh, I stay home and read my Bible. I'm just as well off.\" &gt;&gt; No. prophets. &gt;&gt; The Bible said we shouldn't forsake to assemble ourselves together. &gt;&gt; We got to do that. &gt;&gt; We've got to stand together. And the church said, [Applause] happened in a certain nation that I was in. Someone set up the meetings and we didn't have any cooperation and they just set up the meeting and thousands poured into that country and there was no church home. What difference does that make? &gt;&gt; Now this is 1957. It was the India trip &gt;&gt; which was 1954. So they done had from 1948 up to the early part of 1954 on tape. &gt;&gt; Why didn't they set up tape churches? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God to church. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I've been there at that little church in India and saw that marketplace of what they said tens of thousands of people gathered there and so many of them they couldn't even get them in. It shut down the police. It shut down the city. It shut down everything. You know what gets me is? If Brother Brandham were to be here today, them some same people that that keep on going with all their nonsense about not going to church, Brother Brandham would go to church. And you know what them sorry outfits would do? They'd get ready and get up and go to church. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't be home pressed and play if the prophet of God was standing in the platform. It shows me the height of their hypocrisy. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Word of life. You should come to church whether your pastor is preaching or not. You should come to church whether your favorite evangelist is there. It is your duty to come to the house of God in order to encourage one another and in order to let the devil know, hey, they still go to church. And in order to let God know, hey, they still go to church. I'm going to go down and make love to them while they're there. &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine 50,000 converts And it tells us the same story in 1962 and said every one of them went back to the Sikhs James and Buddhist right &gt;&gt; and he tells us why there was no church home to take them to. I don't know what happened. We had five nights and 5,000 each night or more come to Christ. I don't know what happened. I'm going to go ahead and read the rest of this. &gt;&gt; I've learned a little better than that. Now, &gt;&gt; anybody that's got a brain can you learn better. Come on. Let's make God's prophet what he was. A human being learning as he went. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; This is his words. Press play and say it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Every every Well, apparently one every wasn't enough. Remember Jesus saying, \"Surely, surely, truly, truly.\" That was double verification. So the prophet double verified it again. Every every person that's saved, oh, I found the issue. Showers the world. Every every person that's saved ought to have a church home. &gt;&gt; And every person that's saved in here this morning said, \"What? &gt;&gt; Every every person that's saved ought to have a church home.\" But brother Donnie, a lot of the people at their church don't like me. I know how you feel. I feel the same way sometimes. But you know what? I ain't going to stop coming. Y'all may vote me out as pastor, but you can't vote me out from being able to come here. And if you to block me at the door, I'll sat outside and stream and I run up and down the parking lot. Glory to God. Jesus saved me. Hallelujah. I'm going to heaven. I will not stay home. I'm not going to stay at the house and pout. I'm going to come to church and shout hallelujah. I'm called to worship God. I'm called to go to church. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every every person that's saved ought to have a church home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They ought to be in church every &gt;&gt; every &gt;&gt; time that church has a service or every time you pass it, &gt;&gt; go in, &gt;&gt; open the doors and go in and pray or do something. &gt;&gt; You see, friends, he had a respect of the house of God. I'm afraid many message people do not. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine then that he'd tell people that just passed by the church building just go in and pray. Can I read one more? &gt;&gt; Oh, I know there's many rise up and go out and say, \"Oh, I don't need to go to church anymore. Praise God. Notice how religious they are now. So they tell their lie and then praise God. &gt;&gt; I don't need to go to church anymore. Praise God. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has come. He's the teacher. When you get that idea, you're just wrong. &gt;&gt; Why did the Holy Ghost set teachers in the church? &gt;&gt; Amen. If he was going to be the teacher, there are first apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors. The Holy Spirit set teachers in the church so he could teach through the teacher. &gt;&gt; God sent pastors in the church so hopefully he could pastor through the pastors. He sent evangelist to the church so he could evangelize through the evangelist. He said people in the church instead of chairs, instead of pews so he could live in your life. God don't live in your padded chair. God don't live in no padded pew. God wants your heart, my heart, our soul, that he can live inside of us and be able to let people know, do you go to church? Oh, no. I'm in the message. I don't go to church. Well, you're not in the message there. Because if you really believe God's message of the hour, you find you a place. Well, brother Don, ain't none of them perfect. Why in the world would you want to go to a perfect church? You'd ruin it in five minutes being there. Ain't no one of you perfect, including the preacher that's preaching to you today. I ain't looking for a perfect building. I ain't looking for a perfect people. I found a perfect God. And that perfect God will produce a perfect bride. to read two. Can I read one more? Plus that last one that I read, that would be two, right? One plus one. Brethren, when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it separates you. It delivers you from the things of the world. &gt;&gt; It makes you love God. &gt;&gt; Here we go. &gt;&gt; It makes you go to church. [Music] That's the problem. &gt;&gt; A lot of these folks don't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If they had the Holy Ghost, it'd grab them up. Get your tie on. Get your shirt. I don't want to go to church. I don't like going to church. They're going to have preachers. I don't like this that. The Holy Ghost said, \"I never asked you if you wanted to go.\" This is an order. And you're in the army of God. You get up and put your britches on. You put your shirt on your tie if you're wearing a tie. You don't want to have fine with me that you get to the house of God and don't you stop and roll that bottom lift out but you go to clap in your hand and you smile at that man of God and you pray for that man of God cuz he's been up half a night to in order to serve you a good warm Sunday meal. You ought to realize it. You ought to say, \"Preach it, brother.\" Go ahead, brother. I'm with you. Amen. Hallelujah. Encourage that man of God. Encourage the people sitting around by you to say, \"Amen, too. [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It makes you love God. It makes you go to church. It makes you worship him. It makes you tell your neighbor about it. &gt;&gt; It makes you live above sin. Don't open it, Donnie. Who's running this thing back there in the back? You know what I done? I laid this over and I got all these quotes right here in front of me on this screen. &gt;&gt; Oh, children, &gt;&gt; it ain't no wonder Satan hates church. It ain't no wonder you have such a time when it comes to going to the house of God. You ever have that hard of a time when you're going to Walmart, &gt;&gt; Kroger, Engles, your favorite football team, baseball team, basketball team? Isn't it amazing that everything in the world will try to hinder you from church? How it must please Papa when you come in and you say, \"We made it.\" And you look around said, \"Where's Susie?\" Oh, dear God, we left her at home. Oh, Lord have mercy. Everything in the world would be on your mind. Cuz Satan has been looking over my shoulder and he sees what God's put on my heart and he says, \"Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; if Daniel gets that, oh my goodness, if that sister gets it, oh, the demons go up there and mess up with it, mess up their minds, cause this and cause that, cause it.\" If if they say if he he says that and they get it, it'll set them free from that thing that's been bothering them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're too late. &gt;&gt; I can done tell by the looks on their faces, they got it. Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads together. We'll pick it up again. Lord, oh Jesus. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. I pray today that you'd help each of us. What makes my heart sad about this Lord preaching it is if we could see brother Frank and sister Jackie and ask them would y'all rather be sitting at home streaming because you're not physically able to come to church &gt;&gt; if I could go down into South Africa talk to them folks there who stream our services way out in the middle of nowhere have no church, no preacher around. And I could ask them, \"Would y'all rather stay home and stream?\" Some of them just recently thought they might be able to get a visa to move to the States and they thought they might be able to be allowed to come here. Oh, how excited they were just to be able to go to church. Here we are, Jesus. We can go and the least little thing discourages us. Forgive us, Father. Help us. I pray, dear God. Oh, I know our families are going to go on vacations and trips and things like that. Sure, but the negligence is not so much a vacation. The negligence is not a family outing or something like that, but the negligence is when it's just easier to stream and stay home. You never allowed us or any other churches to start using streaming so that people would just stay at the house. Lord, there's something about us coming together. May we always do it, Lord, I pray. And maybe not just get here, but getting here is part of the battle for sure. But now it's hearing time, listening time, worshiping time. We love you, Father. How many of you today would raise your hand to the Lord? Lord, forgive me. I I've not had the always had the right attitude about church. I admit it, Lord. I've been sawful and lazy. Would you forgive me, Jesus? Would you lay your hand over on that person standing by you and let's just off for a word of prayer. I think of a children if you'd lived in the synagogue day and they would have read the exact same scriptures over and over again made some of the exact same comments service after service after service. Would you like Jesus have been faithful? Oh, you'd have stayed home said he don't need to go. They don't need to go. Thomas missed one meeting and wouldn't you know it that was the very meeting Jesus showed up in a glorified body. Oh my. May God so strike our hearts with the deeper sense of love and devotion to realize you going to church. It's not just about you, but it's when you're there, you're encouraging your pastor. You're encouraging others that see you've come through a hard trial and a hard time and yet they see you pressing and they can tell you're heavy and distraught and you don't know what to do but you come anyhow. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, as we have our hands laid one upon the other. Now it's not just me praying but it's your children praying for one another. Father, I pray dear God, may each of us fall in love with you more than we ever have in our life. And if we fall in love with you, it'll reflect itself by meeting together with you and your children where there you can worship. I believe you want to come in this place this morning with your presence. Put your healing arms, your loving arms around those that are weary and troubled and sad and pull them up close to you, Jesus. Just whisper secret things to them. Oh, hallelujah. Who are we? I know, Lord. Who are we that the almighty God would desire to pull us into his loving arms? I can't say that I fully understand it, but all I know is I believe it's the truth. Help us, Jesus. Forgive us for ever having the idea church as usual. Lord, may we come under such expectation when we walk through them doors that we never know from one service to the next what you're going to do, what you're going to say, how you're going to move. Oh, we worship you, Lord. We worship you. We always want to be open to you that you can do as you wish to do. But we also realize some services we may not see near as much display of your power. And one of the reasons could be because you're wanting to see what we're going to do in that service. So you want to see how are we going to love you with no anointing? How are we going to praise you with no shouting sermon? What are we going to do in that service? And I don't want to fail, Lord. Oh, hallelujah. I bless your name today, Lord God. Can we just lift our hands together now, friends, and just close your eyes? I know you got lunch plans. Beautiful day outside. You got things you're going to do. Nothing wrong with that. But let's not let's not let that crowded to his time. Hallelujah. We worship you, Lord God. I bless your name, Jesus. I thank you, Father. We praise you, Lord. We're here to encourage. We're here, Father. It's our duty. Yes. We have fulfilled our duty today. But we want it to be more than dutious works. We want it to be from our souls, from our hearts. Oh Jesus, with my body I thee worship. With my hands, with my mouth, I thee worship my God. With my soul, I thee worship. I give to you what I give to none other. There's not a person in the world that I love any more any more precious and dear to me than Carol than down to my children, my grandchildren, my church, my friends around the world. But you have that sacred special place that you're the only one that gives a certain type of love and only one that I give a certain type back. It's reserved for you only, Lord. We worship Jesus. We worship you Jesus. With my body, the worship, [Music] with my blood, I gave for you. My sorrow and my crying that day. It was opened all for you. For you are the reason [Music] that I went to Calvary. [Music] Now broad I peel. I ask you my love. Would you give your body to me? Give me all you. Give me all you. I want your hands. I want your eyes. Would you give it all to me? Will you give me all you are? Will you give me all you are? And one day I'll give a new body to you. Service after service I come to meet you. [Music] time after time. I'm there to greet you, but you're so busy with your wife and your children and your business and all your other things, too. that you scarcely raise your hand and your voice and give me time I want from you. Will you give me your all my bride? Lord God forgive us. Oh, will you give me your all, my loving bride. I love you and I want you and I need you to be my wife. Will you give me your all? Will you give me your all? For I gave my all for you. [Music] I'm longing to see you, to hold you, to put my arms around you. I'm longing to touch you, oh God. Oh God, I want to put my hand upon your shoulder, my eyes to meet your eyes [Music] to put my arms all around you, my love, place you by my time. [Music] Will you give me your all? [Music] Will you give me your all? [Music] Reserve that part for me, my love. Only you can share with me. And soon and very soon we'll be together. And soon and very soon we'll be talking. And soon and very soon we'll be walking together. Together. Give me your all today, my bride. Give me your all. Let me be by your side. Will you give me your all? Let me love you so dear. Will you give me your all? I'll take away your fears. Will you give me your all [Music] m It was for you I cried, for you I died, for you I raised from the dead. It was for you I lived. It was for you I give everything I am today. Now will you give me your all? Your all. Will you give me your all? Oh Lord God, [Music] your all. Sweetheart, I want your all. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, we worship you today, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's just raise our hands, can we? I'm going to let you go here shortly. We give you praise, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Father, for all that you mean to us today. Lord, if there's one who hasn't made that full commitment to you today, I'm afraid before they walk out these doors, smite their hearts with such conviction, Lord Jesus, they'll be able to surrender their all finally. Anything they've held back in that secret closet of their life, Lord, may they be able to give it to you and walk out of here with a greater determination to live for you, to serve you. but also to love you like they never have before. We worship you today, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, heavenly father. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Brother Larry, let's sing together. I could still go free. Let's sing this together before we go. Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another to do what? To come together. Exhorting one another. Carol and I was privileged yesterday to be able to meet with some of the widows here at the church and just have a time of fellowship together. And many of them brought pictures and of their husbands that had passed. And each picture that was brought in on the table, my heart got heavier and heavier. And I stood there and looked at him and they wanted me to talk to them a little bit. And I tried to, but I just got so broke up. I could see it on their faces. And some of them talked to me before the little gathering and tears running down their eyes, longing for that resurrection. And how we can do it, cuz we're free. We're free. Let's sing it together. Lock me up in a prison. Let me sing it as we go. You can log Whoa. We won't be able to sing it there, will we? You can lock me up in a prison and throw away the key.

So, I'd like to thank the Lord for my wife Laura, who recently turned 65 years old. As some of you may know, at the age of 26 years old, she was diagnosed with stage 1 pancreatic cancer. The day before the surgery, she said, \"I'm a Christian, so I'm a winner either way, but I want to raise my children.\" By prayer and a great surgical team at Duke, God gave her the desire of her heart and she now has 11 grandchildren. Please pray for her as she goes for tests at the VA hospital tomorrow. Her doctors will perform these tests uh periodically to monitor her status, brother Eric Crrauss. So, thank the Lord for that good testimony, right? Amen. Praise the Lord. Here's another good testimony tonight. Brother Michael Bailey sends in.

And we like that, don't we? Yes, we do. Amen. Sing it, buddy. [Music] When all foundations have been shaken. When I'm left standing in the dark. When I'm in the pillow, heart is breaking. You still rain and you're still God. And when it feels all hope is gone, heavy questions so hard. And though my soul may feel forsaken, you still reign and you're still God. And though I can't see what's before me, [Music] I know that you can trust your heart. [Music] And this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still God. [Music] I will declare you with my faith. Though voices whisper that you're not, you'll never leave me nor forsake me. But you still reign and you're still God. And though I can't see what's before me, [Music] I know I can trust you with your heart. And this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still God. [Music] And though I can't see what's before me, I know I can trust you with my heart. And this one truth will be my story. [Music] You still reign and you're still God. [Music] And when my enemy surrounds me, I trust the victory of your cross and fix my eyes upon you, Jesus. For you are God and I am not. [Music] And though I can't see what's before me, I know that I can trust your heart. And this one truth will be my story. [Music] You still reign and you still God.

You still reign and you're still God. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Ask the brothers to put this on the screen. I I really didn't want to sing this by myself. Um, last time I sung his song, it was during the prayer line and I battled singing it cuz I stood there and I was like, \"This is not a congregational song. This is not a congregational song.\" And then Aaron, he looked at me and he's like, \"All right, it's your time to I was like, this is not a congregational song.\" And then everybody proved me wrong and said, \"This was this is a very good congregational song. So, if you'll help me sing it. If you've been walking the same old road for miles and miles. If you've been hearing the same old voice tell the same old lies. If you're trying to fill the same old holes inside, there's a better life. There's a better life. If you got pain, he's a pain taker. If you feel lost, he's a way maker. If you need freom, save it. He's a prison shaking savior. If you got chains, he's a chain breaker. [Music] We've all searched for the light of day in the dead of night. And we've all found ourselves worn out from the same old fire. And we've all run to things we know just ain't right. But there's a better life. There's a better life. If you got pain, he's a pain taker. If you feel lost, he's a way maker. If you need freedom, save it. He's a prison shaking savior. If you got change, he's a chain breaker. [Music] If you believe it, if you receive it, if you can feel it, somebody testify. If you believe it, if you receive it, if you can feel it. Somebody testify. Testify. If you believe it, if you receive it, if you can feel it, somebody testify you got pain. He's a pain. If you feel lost, he's a way. And you need freedom for savior. He's a prison shaking savior.

God change. He's a change of beauty, freedom, a s. He's a prison shaking savior. Got chains. He's a chain breaker. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Is he your chain breaker? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; It's good to be here. I just pray that you come expecting. &gt;&gt; You know, I've said it before. Not too high. I can't do this. He can. &gt;&gt; It's like you can't sit there, but he can. &gt;&gt; Right. You're not going to get anything if you just sit there. You come expecting. What am I doing? Uh if you don't come expecting, you're just come to a building. But if you come expecting, then he's going to speak to you. Amen. God bless you. If you would turn with me to Genesis, Genesis 12. We're going to read several places, Lord willing. Verses 1 and three. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful to you, Lord. We love you so much and we thank you, Lord Jesus, that you've called us. And Lord, not only did you call us, Lord, but you give us the grace to respond to that call, Father. And Lord Jesus, we're so thankful to you, Lord. We see you in every avenue of our lives, Lord. Lord, even when we're doing wrong, we we've got the grace to have you, Lord, tell us that we're wrong. We're so thankful for that, Lord. There's many people that do wrong and don't even know it, Father. Lord, as the bride of Christ, we're so blessed, Father. And Lord Jesus, tonight we're here, Lord, not to see one another. Although it's nice to see everybody, Lord, but we've come to see you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And we have to look past the veil many times, Lord. And tonight is is another night that we're we're asking that you would help not only myself look past the veil, Lord, and help me to understand that I'm speaking to God in flesh, but I'm asking that they would look past this veil and understand that God in flesh is speaking to them. Father, I pray that you would just take control of this service, Lord. You know what's on my heart. You know, Lord Jesus, that I've studied and I've looked at this, Lord. And well, to be honest, Lord, if my thoughts are here, I I don't want them. I just want you to have your way, Lord. I I pray that you would take these things and just make them and custom fit each and every individual. Lord, we love you and we thank you for it, Lord. We ask it in your name. Amen. Thank you for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord willing, I'm going to speak on destroying all hope. Um destroying all hope. Um I know hope is faced, little sister, and it's important, but I I think sometimes that God wants us to destroy the hope and get to faith. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hope waivers, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We've hoped for a lot of things in our lives, but when you have that faith that comes from God, it don't waver. &gt;&gt; It don't waver. And and another thing about hope, and I was just praying and thinking about this, you know, a Christian's faith doesn't determine the outcome. A real Christian's faith doesn't determine God's will. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? So, we can have all the faith in the world and we can really believe and we we've seen it even here in this church. We've really believed for Sister Erica. That didn't that didn't waver what God's will was. &gt;&gt; We were following general orders, right? &gt;&gt; We were doing exactly what God called us to do. just believe because there's nowhere in the scripture that says have faith and so and so is going to pass away. That's that's not what's in the scripture this have faith. &gt;&gt; But as a Christian, we have faith in God that his will will be done. as a real Christian. The ones that that fall away from from from God and Christianity are the ones that that say they have faith and they might actually have faith, but they don't have faith that God is going to do his perfect will. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, just keep that in mind. if we're going to I I I preached this in in Monosel a couple weeks ago, but the Lord's kind of turned it and we'll see how far he turned it. You know what I'm saying? Amen. Now the Lord said had said unto Abram, \"Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee, and I will make thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and I will make thee a great nation.\" Now, this is Abram, still not father of nations. This is just Abram. So, he's putting that promise forth, right? &gt;&gt; Believe it, receive it. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Uh he will heal the sick. He will, you know, you I I've called you to prosper and be in good health. All those promises. There's a promise right here. &gt;&gt; And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that cursth thee. And in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. Man, that's a lot of that's a lot of promises right there. That's a lot of things. That's that's God putting his for his word forth. He's sewing forth. I don't want to wear you out. Go ahead and be seated. Let me stand for a little while. You go ahead. Now, we're going to turn to to Genesis 13 uh 14- 16. And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place with thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward. So we see here that God has he he made the promise. He made the promise and it's out there, but he's still not the father of nations. &gt;&gt; And there was things that he had to do. Now, now Abram believed God, right? &gt;&gt; He believed God. He was there. The faith was there. He had a supernatural interaction with God. &gt;&gt; Just like every one of you, if you're real Christians, you've had a supernatural interaction with God with your salvation. That's something supernatural. Logically, humanity doesn't see this unknown being, right? &gt;&gt; And he doesn't see how in the world that he could save us &gt;&gt; naturally. But you've had a super something supernatural happen to you that you believe in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we have a supernatural interaction with God. So, we're we're we're believing. That's faith. We believe in that. That's faith. But Abram had to separate from Lot. He had to start getting things out of his life that were interfering. Right. And so he's moved from justification, being called &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; into sanctification, getting cleaned up. &gt;&gt; Right. But it still doesn't make him a father of nations. &gt;&gt; It's still not producing the seed. &gt;&gt; Right. justification, sanctification. For all the land which thou seeest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that the man so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. So here he is repeating again. That's why we come to church. This ain't nothing new, brothers and sisters. I'm not here to surprise you with with new word. That's if I am, then you need to get me out of here because there ain't you know that's not right. This this is not new. I'm just maybe bringing in a different way or or I can express it in a way in in a moment in your life right now that you'll see it better. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I'm not bringing anything new. &gt;&gt; So Abram is God is dealing with Abram the same way. He's telling him over and over again, your seed. You'll be blessed. You're the father of nations, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Abram's like, \"Okay, all right. I I'm seeing it.\" And as now, Abram, sanctify yourself. All right. I can do that. I'm going to separate myself. Now, I'm a little hard-headed. It's going to take me a while. We can't go through the whole whole scripture. And I don't know anybody else like that. But old Abram, bless his heart, he was a little hard-headed. It took him a while. We know the story. I We don't have time to to rehash all that, but you understand where I'm coming from. And this these are not the these are just a couple points that that I picked up. Now, let's go to Genesis 18 verse 10. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life, and lo, Sarah, thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and wellstricken in age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. So, here's that promise all those years ago and it's been repeated and it's been told and Abram was still believing &gt;&gt; but he had somebody very close to him &gt;&gt; that their faith had kind of fallen off. &gt;&gt; It kind of fell off. &gt;&gt; She's like, \"Well, that was nice.\" &gt;&gt; Oh, Abram, bless his heart. &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's kind of it's kind of shaken a little bit. &gt;&gt; We all have those &gt;&gt; in our lives. &gt;&gt; We all have those that we we go through the we we believe and we have this faith and we get sanctified and then we think we come across old friends or our family and they're saying, \"Is that message really &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; necessary? Is holiness really necessary?\" That's good. &gt;&gt; Do you really have to live that way? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Was a prophet really necessary? I mean, there's plenty of Baptist churches that that have a lot to offer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If if you don't want to go to the Baptist, you can go to the Methodist or the the Pentecostals. Pentecostals. Shout. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and and work it out. I'm a good Christian. I don't know how many times I've heard that. I don't have to believe like that. &gt;&gt; I love God. They have faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They have faith. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; They had to. They believe in Jesus Christ. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But here they are. And those those things whisper in ear. We've had a great falling away from the message. Did they ever have really have faith? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, they really had faith, but it only come to a spot. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Any anybody that can talk you into something can also talk you out of it. Right. &gt;&gt; There's something in me that I don't care that crazy. I don't I don't understand why in the world people would walk away from this. &gt;&gt; I just don't get it. &gt;&gt; It's hard for me to comprehend. And then I see the ones that have walked away and most of them their lives went &gt;&gt; they lost everything. &gt;&gt; Their dignity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Used to have a standard. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now there's no standard. &gt;&gt; Huh. But they had faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't the faith of God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And they went ahead and took God's permissive will. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, \"After I am waxed old, shall I have pleasure with my Lord also?\" or being old also doesn't make sense. This don't this don't line up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Everybody in the world is is is doing this. I can come in and I can worship God and I can at any old church. &gt;&gt; God so loved the world. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; he did. &gt;&gt; God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. They had faith in that. And the Lord said unto Abram, Abraham, wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of shy bear a child which I am old? And I meant to mention this. It's Sarah and Abraham at this point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, &gt;&gt; let's just stop right there just for a second. At this point, he's the father of nations. &gt;&gt; And he's got one son, Ishmael, &gt;&gt; it's not the promised son, &gt;&gt; and it's not certainly not of nations, right? &gt;&gt; It's not what God has is has really called him to. He knew that it was supposed to come through Sarah. And Sarah said, \"Let me help you out, God.\" Oh, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; I wish that I could take back all those times that I helped God out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be awesome? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'd be a whole lot further down the road. &gt;&gt; If I would stop helping God out and if I could take back the times that I did help God out, &gt;&gt; preach now, &gt;&gt; right? Yes, sir. Oh, the mighty John. Let me help you out, God. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; I got this. &gt;&gt; Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. To take those away. &gt;&gt; And to never do it again. Let's be honest, &gt;&gt; cuz every one of us here, the Lord Terries, is going to try and help him out again cuz we just we're hard-headed and we still got flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Is anything too hard for the Lord? Back in church again. at the appointed time I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son. Uh that the one who doubted the one who questioned the one who shook on her faith in what God really told them or and and and told Sarah you're going to have this child and she laughed at him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And God looked past her ignorance &gt;&gt; because his will will be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Children of God can only fall into permissive will for so long. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's been times I've been in his permissive will. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; There's been too many times I've been in his permissive will. &gt;&gt; However, because I am a son of God, because you are sons and daughters of God and you're the bride of Christ, &gt;&gt; your final act will not be his permissive will. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It will be his perfect will. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let that soak in just a minute. &gt;&gt; There's plenty of people out there that are falling into his permissive will time and time and time again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they'll end up in his permissive will. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But we have real faith. We have something anchored and solid, something that that's going to hold us and keep us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And when all the dust settles and everything shakes out from our hearts, it's going to be yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not my way, Lord. It's your way. &gt;&gt; It's not my will, Lord. It's your will. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't care what it takes, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to take control of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at Genesis 22 verses 1. I got a lot to cover, so we're going to have to verses one through. We're going to try. And it came to pass after the these things that God did did tempt Abraham. What? &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. The devil is the tempter. Not according to this right here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God did tempt Abraham. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Why would God do that? Cuz we need faith at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we need unshakable, unquestioning faith at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; That's why God will tempt us. &gt;&gt; He will shake us. He will question us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. People don't just pick up a basketball and are able to play basketball or baseball or sewing or whatever cooking. Lord, please help us. They don't just go in a kitchen and just make this meal that's just fantastic. Takes practice. Right. &gt;&gt; Takes years of practice. &gt;&gt; Well, what makes you think it that we're just going to step into this faith? &gt;&gt; If God don't have us practice believing what God has for us, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How are we just supposed to step into this and say, \"Well, I'm here, God. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; I hear your call.\" &gt;&gt; Wow. True. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's a rude awakening when God tempt us. &gt;&gt; It's hard. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And some of those those things go back to that that wanting God's will more than we want our own way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's so easy to pout on God. &gt;&gt; That's good. We all have that lip that can roll right on out. &gt;&gt; We just push that thing out there. You You said you were going to heal me and I had to wait three weeks. &gt;&gt; You said you'd provide my every need. And &gt;&gt; I had to go to the food stamp office. &gt;&gt; Guess what? He did provide your need. Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; He did. &gt;&gt; Just not the way you wanted, &gt;&gt; right? But we get this attitude against God saying, \"Hey, this is the way it should be.\" &gt;&gt; It's truth. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; But we have to practice that. We have to get into that mode where we struggle sometimes &gt;&gt; and we believe. We really believe. We're taking the word and we're taking it. We're eating it and we're believing saying, \"God, you'll provide my every need.\" And I have to ask somebody for $10 for gas or whatever it might be. &gt;&gt; It's getting tight in here. &gt;&gt; Some of us don't like it. I don't I don't like it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Humble thyself. Okay. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's going to heal me. Yeah. Go to the doctor. Right. There's all kinds of variation of this the same mindset, the same thing that we've had on God because we expect God to do things a certain way because we wanted the miraculous. We wanted the the the spiritual, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We want to hear it from the pulpit and embrace it and and just take it. &gt;&gt; Well, you got to embrace and take this part, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, \"Take now thy son, thine only son.\" Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; Didn't we say Ishmael was here? &gt;&gt; All those things that we helped with, &gt;&gt; he don't even recognize. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Chalk that up to stupidity. &gt;&gt; I'm not even going to recognize that. That's good. &gt;&gt; And Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and claved the wood, the burnt offerings, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. So Abram, Abraham is making preparation to do exactly what God said. We're walking. He's walking in the word. And every day Abraham has those scriptures. I'll make thy seed as the sands of the sea. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's got those. They're they're tucked away in his heart. He's got those promises &gt;&gt; and he's waiting at any moment for God to intervene because he knows that's what the promise is. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's real faith. &gt;&gt; We are to be expecting God to intervene at any moment. &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't waver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith from God wanting his will doesn't shake from one side or the other. But but every step we're saying, \"Okay, God, you're leading me this direction. I'm going to go this direction.\" &gt;&gt; And at any moment, you could step on the scene and change this situation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he says, \"Yes, yes, I can.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do next? &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says he didn't tell Syria, Sarah, his wife. &gt;&gt; No, he did &gt;&gt; cuz he was afraid that she was going to knock him down. Hm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He got two servants and his son and his animal and the wood and he said, \"We'll be back in a few days.\" \"Where are you going?\" Oh, it's a surprise. He didn't lie and he took off. And at first Abraham said, \"Well, maybe if I get everything ready, God will stop me.\" &gt;&gt; And then God didn't stop him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then he said, \"Well, maybe if we head down the road, we start out, then God will have me just turn around. He knew the promise. &gt;&gt; Maybe you woke up with a head cold and and first thing in the morning you said, \"Well, Lord, you're my healer. At any moment you could take it away at any time. I'm believing. I'm going to praise you for it.\" Ah, and you're doing exactly what the word says. Exactly what the word says. I'm going to praise you for it. I'm going to believe for it. By this afternoon, that head coat will be gone. Afternoon comes and goes. Well, I'll believe for it. I'm going to take some nightquil. I'm going to get a good night's sleep. Lord, is it okay if I take nightquil? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; My face not shaking. I just I just need to get some sleep, Lord. You wake up in the morning and it's worse. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? This is this is in everything in our lives. We we we I wake up in the morning say, \"Lord, come quickly.\" &gt;&gt; And I have to go through my whole day. This is what's expected of us. We had to go through our whole day expecting him to come in a twinkling in an eye, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What's What's the difference? &gt;&gt; What's the difference between that and what Abraham had to do, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We are to be expecting. We're supposed to be anticipating his coming and living &gt;&gt; like he can come any moment. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And we have to go put our work boots on. &gt;&gt; I wish we could skip that part. &gt;&gt; Even so, come quickly, Lord. &gt;&gt; If that's what it takes to get you in that mindset of of even so, come quickly. &gt;&gt; We got to plant our potatoes, too. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. He's called us that. &gt;&gt; Some of them crazy people that that believed that God was coming back in 77 or what it was, went out and got loans and all that and and went into debt and they left the message because he didn't come the way that he &gt;&gt; that that they thought he should come. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right, &gt;&gt; man. There's plenty of loonies out there. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about out there. I'm talking about in the message ranks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Some of these people are crazy. &gt;&gt; But even so, come quickly. But Lord, I I'm going to have to save up for a car in case mine breaks down or whatever more. &gt;&gt; That's real faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's expecting the best. and planning for the worst. &gt;&gt; Nobody likes that side of it. &gt;&gt; I don't like that side of it. I wish it was all gumb gumballs and lollipops and rainbows and whatever else, &gt;&gt; but it's not. Reality is he's called us to a faith. Lord, I want your perfect will. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. And if it's your perfect will for me to go through this trial, this struggle, this low valley, &gt;&gt; even so come quickly. &gt;&gt; Circumstance does not change the bride's outcome. Then on the third day, day three, Abraham so showed him or God showed Abraham where he was supposed to go. It wasn't a quick trip. Three days he started heading in a direction. &gt;&gt; It sounds like life. &gt;&gt; Just heading in a direction. Now, our goal is to get where God called us to be. &gt;&gt; And day by day, &gt;&gt; moment by moment, we're progressing along. We have that faith that God is going to move for us. We have that faith that God is doing something in our lives. And we also have that faith knowing that he's called us to do something that's uncomfortable sometimes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. Can you imagine in I don't know about you, but in with me in my heart when I know I have something that I have to do that I don't like. &gt;&gt; Lord, please help me. Lord, I I don't Lord, you know this is this is not what I had in mind. &gt;&gt; Lord, this is uncomfortable for me. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to work with that person again. Lord, I know that you're molding me and making me and you're using that guy and I'm not supposed to ball up my fist. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hey, you're never going to get anything else but brother John up here. I'm sorry. This is just me. I'm not trying to be nothing. I'm not trying to hide from from me. Unfortunately, you can see it. &gt;&gt; Three days, Abraham. Oh, Lord, please help me. I don't know what I don't know what you're doing, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's those times and and Abraham felt like his prayers didn't even get up past the ceiling. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He'd lay there and he's asking, \"God, please. I know what you promised. I know what you said. I know that I'm going to be the father of nations.\" And you said the seed would come through Sarah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you said that it was going to be Isaac. &gt;&gt; And you've called me to go sacrifice him. I I I don't I don't understand. Yeah, &gt;&gt; maybe I'm the only one who's ever had the I don't understand thoughts. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't get it. &gt;&gt; And it's human nature to want to understand what's going on. We want to be in control. If we understand it, we can control it a little better. Some of you have been praying for deliverance for years and years from a certain habit, a certain thing. &gt;&gt; Let's just get down to where it is. &gt;&gt; We know in the word it's against his word the the the besetting sin that's hanging on us. We know it's against his word to have this attitude towards somebody or an attitude at all in a certain way. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And we're walking along and we struggle with it and we say, \"Lord, you said that you deliver me from this and I'm fighting it still.\" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's against your word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's not your will for me to be having this. Some of you it's it's it's doubt that you have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Some of you it's things that you hide. Some of you it's things that are very apparent. An attitude. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's a habit. &gt;&gt; It's all these things. You know what your yours is. I know what mine is. &gt;&gt; And we know it's God's will that it's not supposed to be there. &gt;&gt; And we go day by day and we're under we're we're we're we're questioning and we don't understand. We've got these questions. God, why? Why am I here? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know I can't serve you the right way with this guilt hanging on me. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I told you it might go in a different direction. Let me tell you, this is a different direction. &gt;&gt; I know this isn't your perfect will. And I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God. And yet I still have this thing. &gt;&gt; That's a hard way to be. It's a hard way to live. &gt;&gt; Guilt is an awful thing. And for a Christian that's falling short of the glory of God, that guilt is very prevalent. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it should be. &gt;&gt; It should bother you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that Holy Ghost saying, \"Hey, you're better than this.\" &gt;&gt; It's that Holy Ghost saying, \"Hey, you're better than this. You mean the Holy Ghost would tempt us?\" &gt;&gt; And God did tempt Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He didn't say he was wasn't going to deliver him. Now, Abraham was in the midst of the trial. He didn't know the end. We're we we have the luxury of knowing the end of Abraham's story. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. We have the luxury of knowing the end of your story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's rapture, right? &gt;&gt; It's that perfect word living in us. &gt;&gt; But in the middle of it, what does it feel like? It's so heavy. I don't understand God. Right? &gt;&gt; Why can't I overcome this? God, why are you tempting me this way? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; This ain't in my notes. And we know what his perfect will is this in this situation. Just like Abraham knew what his the perfect will was in his situation. &gt;&gt; But it don't always make it easy. &gt;&gt; Guilt don't go away because you know you're not supposed to &gt;&gt; and that you will overcome it. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to have faith that you will. &gt;&gt; That's that's right. But it don't make it easier to deal with. &gt;&gt; Not as a Christian. &gt;&gt; Three days journey. He's still waiting. &gt;&gt; Some of you it's been 10 years journey. You're still waiting. That's tight. &gt;&gt; Come on. Then on the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off. Oh, it was like I was telling my son Ben on the way over here. I said, \"This is the worst part of the service.\" I get up here and I I I've been preaching long enough and I've done it enough that I know that if I submit and get out of the way, then he'll take over. This part's easy right now. Now the pre and the post not so fun. The pre you're thinking, \"Oh, am I really finding the mind of God?\" And then afterwards like, \"Boy, you really miss God. It's miserable.\" &gt;&gt; So Abraham was preparing to take off and he knew that he was going to have to face Sarah and have have to ask her some questions, maybe skirt around a few questions. And then when he saw that a far off, he knew, \"Oh, it's coming. It's coming.\" And Abraham said unto his young men, \"Abide here with the ass, and I will and I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you.\" Abra Abraham was tempted of God. Abraham understood the promise. He's still waiting for God to intervene at this moment. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Still waiting for God to intervene. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But he knew the promise and he quoted the promise and he stayed with the promise. I and the lad will return. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's going to happen. I don't know when God's going to step in here, but I know what the promise is. Right, &gt;&gt; brother and sister. Are you glad you know what the promise is? &gt;&gt; Thank God. I'd go crazy if I didn't know the promise. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be able to make it if I didn't know what the promise is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He kept quoting the promise. His testimony was positive. &gt;&gt; Should we stop there for just a minute? His brother Joel Forny says, \"Wowy, wowy woo.\" We get those wowsy wowsy woo moments. Poor me. I can't believe I'm going through this. God, why are you doing this to me? God, you said I was an overcomer. I'm not an overcomer because I'm still dealing. And a testimony and the confession is not what it should be. If you're in the midst of that besetting sin, if you're in the midst of that problem, in that situation, God's still your deliverer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's still the one who made the promise, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That doesn't change. &gt;&gt; Circumstance doesn't change. Jonah and the whale, right? Surrounded by b whale belly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; His circumstance didn't dictate the outcome. &gt;&gt; Right. Sure did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The promise was he was going to preach in Nineveh. &gt;&gt; He didn't like it. He didn't want to do it. &gt;&gt; He ran from it. God said, \"Guess what? You're going through a pipe, old boy, or a fish in this circumstance. &gt;&gt; Not going to be fun. &gt;&gt; Circumstance didn't change the outcome. Your circumstance, brothers and sisters, will not will not change your outcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; His will is what determines where we end up. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Not our circumstance. &gt;&gt; We're sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Not our issues, not our our attitudes, but his will will determine our outcome. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; and Abraham took the the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon his Isaac his son. And he took the fire in his hand and a knife. And they went both of of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, \"My father.\" And he said, \"Here am I, my son.\" And he said, \"Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\" &gt;&gt; Where's the lamb for the burnt offering? Lord, you said you were my deliverer. &gt;&gt; You said you were my healer. &gt;&gt; You said I was an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Where's the lamb? &gt;&gt; Where's the sacrifice? By your stripes, I am healed. &gt;&gt; I can't heal you anymore. He can't heal you anymore than he did on the cross. There's a promise. The work was performed. It's already done. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Where's my burnt offering, Lord? And Abraham said, \"My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.\" So they both for So they went both of them together right up on the hill. Now Isaac was scratching his head too, &gt;&gt; still questioning. And they came to the place where God had told him of. And Abraham built an altar there. And he laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son. Following through, following through. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God's not going to act ask us to sacrifice our son, &gt;&gt; but he might ask us to sacrifice our pride. &gt;&gt; It's hard to say God's a healer. God's a healer. God's a healer. God's a healer. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the doctor. God's a healer. Right. It's his word. &gt;&gt; It's his word. &gt;&gt; Abraham knew what he was promised. Brothers and sisters, we get so much going on and we've got so much of life happening. &gt;&gt; Life life isn't chaotic anymore. It just happens. &gt;&gt; I'm past the chaos. I'm used to the chaos. Maybe I'm the only one, but I'm used to the chaos. &gt;&gt; It just happens &gt;&gt; and we have to deal with it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And God expects us and not only does he expect us to to deal with it, but he expects us to do it well. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I have I've I've I've asked all my kids. This is one of my rules growing up in my house. They don't like it when I preach. It's nothing bad. Don't worry, boys. You need to work in the in the food service or um what's the other thing? Retail. So, you know how to treat somebody when you order food and they get it wrong. Boy, that's hard. Boy, that's hard to do. But if you ever been on the other side of it and guess what? You know how to treat somebody. I can tell the ones that worked in retail, they're all no joke &gt;&gt; cuz we've all had those customers &gt;&gt; and they're always right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you feel like they're just right for knocking out. But we need to be able to treat people with kindness in spite of the problems that we have. And it's frustrating &gt;&gt; and it's hard. &gt;&gt; But we need to learn how to deal with stuff. &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; We need to learn how to treat people that aren't Christians. &gt;&gt; Because just because they're not treating you like a Christian would treat you doesn't mean that you shouldn't treat them like a Christian should treat them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might be the only Jesus they see &gt;&gt; all day long. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Have you seen some of them characters working in that fast food joint? They ain't seen G Jesus and a lot of them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You might be the only ones. That was free. That wasn't in my notes either. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said,\"Abraham, Abraham.\" And he said, \"Here am I.\" Ah. And he said, \"Lay not thine hand upon thy lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearst God.\" Fearst God. How fierest God. I'm going to keep believing and I'm going to keep trusting. If it's it's so important that we keep the mindset God's knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; But I'm lonely. God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. H. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been sick for this long. God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've dealt with this besetting sin. I'm an overcomer. It's going to happen. The promise is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that you should just embrace that besetting sense of, \"Oh, God's using it. Oh, I No. No. Quite the opposite. You push that thing away and you stomp it and you kick it and you tell it, \"I will not. This is not me. &gt;&gt; This is not me.\" &gt;&gt; I'm not catering to this. &gt;&gt; Even so, come quickly. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You ever been in such a place in your life and you've been fighting with something for so long and it seems like and your prayers turn from even so come quickly to Lord, can you wait till I overcome this? &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; There won't be a lot of people that admit that, Brother Freddy. But I've been in that place where I've said, \"Oh Lord, you're going to have to hold on a couple days till I overcome this cuz I know this ain't right.\" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's where we are, brothers and sisters. It it it's not supposed to shake us. It's not going to shake us. We're sons and daughters of God. He knows what's best for us. &gt;&gt; We are overcomers. &gt;&gt; We're not always overcomers on our time because our strength is nothing. We can't do it on our own. &gt;&gt; And maybe that's the very point that he's trying to get across to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That might be the whole reason why you're struggling with this thing, whatever it might be, because he wants you to settle in and know that you are nothing &gt;&gt; without him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't overcome anything without him. And maybe he wants you to settle in and say, \"God, I give up.\" &gt;&gt; I'm done. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I've had a demon cast out of me by a look of a man of God cuz I was at that point. I was praying about something and struggled and struggled and struggled. And this brother just looked at me. He was under the anointing. He was in a place. He didn't even pray for me. He didn't lay his hands on me. And I knew at that very moment that I was delivered. &gt;&gt; How's that possible? &gt;&gt; I finally said, \"God, I've been trying for years. I can't do it. &gt;&gt; Here's a man of God. Here's an opportunity. I I'm giving it to you.\" Amazing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We've got to get to the place, brothers and sisters, where we realize that it's God and only God. All he wants us to do is believe. &gt;&gt; See the promise and walk towards it. Keep going towards it. Keep going towards it. Keep moving towards it. But I got this circumstance don't matter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says in Jehovah Gyra. Now what if Abraham says now wait was that vision true? Let me study now. Was that vision true? Brother Ram saying, is Abraham going to question his experience with God? Something that's settled. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's where the devil wants to get you. &gt;&gt; Now, God said for me to take my boy and kill him. Now, how am I ever going to to be the father of nations? And that's my seed. And that's a promise seed. Now, how am I ever going to be the father of nations when God is destroying the only hope I have? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Destroying the only hope that I have. &gt;&gt; Is that the hope? Only hope that I have. No, I still have I still got his word. He promised me back there that he'd do it. And through Isaac, all the world would would be blessed. Through Isaac, all the world would be blessed. &gt;&gt; Through you, all the world will be blessed. The bride is what's holding back &gt;&gt; those demons. &gt;&gt; So he said, listen to Abraham now. I received him as one from the dead. I'm persuaded that God is able to raise him up from the dead. Oh my, even with a a horse throat, I feel religious. So brother Brandham's got a horse throat. If I receive received him as one from the dead, what? Guess what? The garden made us dead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we've received him as one from the dead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We've received his promise. Don't matter the circumstance. Don't matter how how are we going to make this happen? We're not. &gt;&gt; We're not. God's going to make it happen. &gt;&gt; The seed in his own body was dead at 100 years old. The deadness of Sarah's womb, they were both sterile to being with. And then God performed a miracle and put his germ of life in there. He received him from the dead as one being dead. Then God's able to raise him up from the dead. Perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Oh my. If that wouldn't make a Presbyterian shout. Think of that. &gt;&gt; So here he is. That's what I That's what I'm We're building our experience through our trials. And God's tempting us. We're building these experiences. &gt;&gt; All these trials. Look, I'm going through some hard stuff. Harder than I've ever had to go through. And as a Christian, you could all say the same thing. &gt;&gt; Going through some hard stuff, and it's harder now than it ever has been. &gt;&gt; But you know what the difference is? I'm not near as worried as I used to be about it. &gt;&gt; I'm not near as concerned about how the outcome's going to be as I used to be. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God tempted me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he followed through with his word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And after every victory, my faith got bigger. &gt;&gt; After every victory, I come back and said, \"Well, God, you did this for me. Is it too hard for God?\" My &gt;&gt; Abraham staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief, but was strong, giving praise to his name. I'm going to switch gears a little bit and and just look at Philippians 2. Verse one. Now I got to make it fast. If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, any if any fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels of mercy, fulfill ye my joy, that ye may be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, one mind. So what's God's mind for you? What is if if we're called to have the same mind of Christ, what is his goal? What is his purpose? What is his whole what is he waiting for us to get his mind? And we know that the prophet said he's under greater anticipation to call us home than we are &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; to go home. That's his mindset, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he's called us to have that mindset. We're going home. &gt;&gt; Well, brother John, what? We can't go with all these circumstances. No, we're going home. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how we get there. what we have to overcome to get there. We're going to get there. &gt;&gt; That's that's God's mindset, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's what he sees. Does he see me fall short? Yes. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Does he see you fall short? &gt;&gt; Has he thrown you out? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, forget it. That guy, I'm telling you, I have worked on him and worked on him and worked on him. You know, we'll just start over with somebody else. No, he has that image in his mind that he had of you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, \"I'm going to fill out that per that that picture album and you're going to be there &gt;&gt; in spite of you.\" &gt;&gt; Watch how I could sing, \"My God is an awesome God.\" Why? Because I know &gt;&gt; that he's put up with me. How awesome is that? &gt;&gt; My wife and kids don't even want to do that sometimes. But he keeps putting up with me. &gt;&gt; And we've all had those moments where we're saying, \"God, why do you put up with me? I'm just going to take this and just because it's encouraging. I just want to I want to take this little I don't this is the way the Lord's leading me. So, we're going to I put it in here and I didn't understand why, but we're just going to do it. It's a I perceive that thou art a prophet. It's 53. Brother Brown says, \"And coming down through the people.\" Now, now you all heard this before. I'm not telling you anything new, but I I want to stir it up, make you understand. Coming down through the people. Now, down in the south, they have the the Jim Crow law. That is colored and white can't mix together. So here come a a a colored girl about 17 18 years old and oh she was in her this her her eyes was white with cataract as my shirt and she was coming pressing through the crowds somebody please help me daddy and I thought why don't some of these people help that poor girl so I thought while he wasn't looking I'd move along a little so I got over there and I kept getting right in her way and watching ing these men to come. And she came right up and I stood like that and she bumped into me. She her hands tugged me. She said, \"Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.\" Said, \"Daddy.\" I thought I said, \"What are you looking for?\" She said, \"Sir, I've lost my daddy. I'm blind.\" She said, \"I can't find him. I don't know what to do.\" Said, \"Nobody will help me.\" Will you help me, kind sir? H &gt;&gt; will you help me con sir? &gt;&gt; So this is a a black girl and it was okay back then. It wasn't that's what black folks want to be called was colored. So don't get all crazy with that. That's what they maybe they didn't want to but that's what they were called. She's in a group of white people, blind, and lost her only way home, her daddy. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Tough circumstances. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I said, \"Well, I don't see no more color people around here.\" Said, \"Where are you from?\" She said, \"Memphis.\" &gt;&gt; So, he's bringing forth. He said, \"Look, you're in a you're in a dangerous spot right now. You're a black girl in a white crowd. This is not a nice place. Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz cuz a lot of them racist claim Christianity, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And shame on them, &gt;&gt; back then and now. Let's go ahead and say it. &gt;&gt; And I looked and there was a bunch of charter buses sitting there and I knowed one of them was from Memphis. And that's how I said, \"What are you doing over here?\" She said, \"I listening to the radio this morning.\" She said, \"I heard about all those deaf and dumb people they had up there that was deaf and dumb last night speaking on the radio.\" And I said, \"And you're blind?\" See? I said, \"What'd you come over here for?\" She said, \"I come to see the healer.\" I said, \"The what?\" She said, \"The healer.\" And I said, \"You don't believe that, do you?\" &gt;&gt; Hm. Sounds like she's tempting. You're getting tempted. The prophet is tempting this girl. &gt;&gt; This is God called man tempting this girl. &gt;&gt; You don't believe that? &gt;&gt; H Yeah. He says, \"Now that looked like a hypocrite, too, taking advantage of a blind woman.\" See, but I wanted to see whether she really believed it. Do you believe that's the truth? She said, \"Yes, sir.\" And I I began to feel it and she said, \"Yes, sir. I believe it.\" And I said, \"Why don't you believe that God would do something like that? As far advanced as med medical science is h science can't do nothing for you, why would you believe something supernatural would? Yeah. &gt;&gt; H. She said, \"Sir,\" and said, \"When I was a little girl, I got cataracts on my eyes. The doctor told me when they got ripe, I don't know what that means, but when it got ripe, they'd take them off.\" And said, \"Now they're ripe.\" And said, \"They say if they take them out, they pull the optical nerves right out of my eyes.\" Said, \"I can't see.\" And the only hope I got is to get in there. And this is the man last the this is the man's last night here. And they tell me I can't even get near the building. I've lost my daddy. I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; I don't know what to do. I've had those moments. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I said, \"Do you believe if you'd get in there, you'd be healed?\" She said, \"Well, I heard of a man on the radio this morning from up at Connect Ket, Missouri. Had been blind for 10 years and he received his sight.\" So said, \"Well, couldn't I be healed too?\" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can't you overcome, too? &gt;&gt; Can't you be healed, too? &gt;&gt; Can't God take care of your problems, too? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How many's had something miraculous happen? Raise your hands. Get them up there. &gt;&gt; Look around. Whatever your situation is, if he did it for brother Harry, can he do it for me? &gt;&gt; If he did it for brother Rob, &gt;&gt; can he do it for me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to stop looking within ourselves and say, \"I'm a son of do son or daughter of God.\" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I have just as much right to your healing, your deliverance, your overcoming as anybody else here. &gt;&gt; Sure. His word is not a respector of persons. &gt;&gt; I said, \"Do you believe that?\" She said, \"Sir, I'll tell you what I'll do. If you'll just get me into where that man's at, I'll be able to find my daddy after that.\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; I'll be able to find my daddy. She had a tiepole. She had something to anchor her. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, we know it wasn't brother Brandham. It was Jesus Christ. But he was a channel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; She held on to that. &gt;&gt; All these problems are going to go away if I can just get to that place. &gt;&gt; I'll find my own daddy. I'll get my own way home. I felt my heart drop right away from from me. I thought, poor old blind thing. I said, \"Look, lady, do you mean that?\" Still tempting her. &gt;&gt; Still tempting her. Do you mean that? &gt;&gt; She said, \"Yes.\" Oh, I said, \"Maybe I'm the one you're supposed to see.\" And she grabbed me up like that. She said, \"Is you the healer?\" And I said, \"No, ma'am.\" I said, \"I'm Brother Brandham. Jesus is the healer.\" &gt;&gt; And she grabbed me. She said, \"Oh, Brother Brandham, have mercy on me. Have mercy on me.\" And I thought of poor old blind Fanny Crosby. &gt;&gt; Fanny Crosby never did get her sight. Never did. &gt;&gt; She never did. And I'm I'm going for memory, but if memory serves her, right, Brother Random said that if she would have got her healing, she wouldn't have been able to write those songs that she wrote. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, God's a healer. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; But as a son and daughter of God, he heals within the bounds of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, you're casting a death. No, she never did quit praying for healing. Brother Brand doesn't say that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But she kept believing. &gt;&gt; And that's what he's called us to do, to keep believing, to keep having that faith that he's called us to as sons and daughters of God. He's called us to that. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't call us just to believe because of the results because we don't like the results sometimes. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't mean he's not God. And it doesn't mean that his will hasn't been done. &gt;&gt; General orders by his stripes I am healed. &gt;&gt; You are an overcomer. &gt;&gt; You are more than a conqueror. All these things and we hold on to those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. and we'll know when God says that's my will and then we won't have to ask anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But until that's settled in your heart, just like that faith is settled in your heart, you keep believing for his promises. Right. &gt;&gt; And I looked and I thought her only hope, Christ. I said, \"Now, I don't want to be recognized in the crowd. Lady, you bow your head and we'll have a word of prayer.\" Said, \"First, I want to hold your hand while I'm praying.\" I couldn't get her hand off my coat. She wasn't going to let me go. &gt;&gt; Pass me not, oh gentle savior. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will wrestle with you. &gt;&gt; I will hold on to you, God. &gt;&gt; I'm not letting go. &gt;&gt; I'm not stopping. I'm going to keep believing. You're my deliverer. You're my my overcomer. You're my healer. And I said, \"Now let me have your hand.\" She said, \"Don't pass me.\" And I took hold of her hand and pulled it off and held her hand. And while I was praying, now you can mark this is fanaticism if you want to. That would be between you and God. See, I could only tell the truth. Something happened. I knew the woman was healed. I was waiting for the shrinkage of that cataract. I said, \"Now keep your lids closed over your eyes.\" I said, \"Now you raise your head just about to where you think my voice is coming and I'll tell you what to do.\" She said, \"Yes, sir.\" Said something cold went over me. I said, \"Just raise your head.\" And I said, \"Now open your eyes, for thus saith the Holy Spirit, you've received your sight.\" And she opened her eyes and she said, \"Is that light?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Is them black dots there? Is that people?\" Her eyesight was not clear. &gt;&gt; It wasn't It wasn't all the way there. &gt;&gt; This is another point where God is tempting this girl. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How many times did brother Random say, \"Go confessing. Go believing.\" &gt;&gt; Don't matter what your symptoms are, you keep confessing your healing. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Don't matter what your your your your uh besetting sin is. You keep confessing your healing. &gt;&gt; You keep going. Keep marching towards that thing. &gt;&gt; Don't settle for it. Well, I can see white lights and shapes of people. That's good enough. Oh Lord, she says, \"Oh Lord, I who was once blind can now see.\" She let out a big scream. And then they've been some people standing there and watching and here they come. My you talk about and I happened to look now he's trying to get out of a meeting and he's supposed to meet these brothers that are supposed to escort him to a car and he snuck out a back door but there was this mass of people he couldn't get through and this is when he ran into this just in case you uh and I happened to look and there was an old man standing there with a cane an old club in his hand his leg was twisted sideways said brother Brandham I know you. He said, \"I've been standing in the rain for eight or 10 days here.\" Eight or 10 days in the rain. Why? &gt;&gt; God was tempting him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Said, \"You wouldn't pass me, would you, Brother Brandon?\" Said, \"I got a bunch of kitties at home.\" Said, \"They need me.\" said, \"A woman going to run over me and I'm twisted my leg like this.\" I said, \"Do you believe?\" He said, \"With all my heart and I said of in the name of the Lord Jesus, give me your cane.\" &gt;&gt; It didn't say his foot straightened out first. &gt;&gt; It didn't say he was healed and jumped around and handed him the cane. &gt;&gt; He said, \"Give me that cane.\" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know. Aa Allen used to have an anvil on the platform, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And what would he do? I need healing for my eyes. Give me your glasses. &gt;&gt; He set them on the anvil and crush them with a hammer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Ain't no turning back. Ain't no turning back. And the Lord who is my sovereign judge when that man in the act of faith handed his cane his leg come straight and he jumped into the air and screamed to the top of his voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; What are you in need of? How has God been tempting you? Where are you at in your walk? Are you questioning? Do you not understand? You wouldn't be the only one. This message, have you read some stuff online and it's in your mind? Sometimes God opens portals to hell to get your attention. What are you made of? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Where are you at in your experience? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wants all your hope hope destroyed. We don't need hope in the last days. It starts with hope. A lot of times, a lot of things start with hope, don't get me wrong, but hope is shaky. &gt;&gt; We have to be established in faith, brothers. Come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where's your walk? It's time to self-examine. Say, \"Brother John, I I believe I believe. But man, I'm really struggling. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I've been in a circumstance for so long. I've dealt with a besetting sin for so long. &gt;&gt; I've dealt with this struggle or that struggle. Does your circumstance change who God is? &gt;&gt; No. Does your problem change who God is? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. Be sure that your call is sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're going through, brothers and sisters. Stand with me if you would. I don't care how bad that you feel tempted. Sometimes that tempted temptation is of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's wanting to make sure that you know that you know. And the and the closer we get to home, the more important it is that we're sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So things are going to get tighter. Things are going to get harder. We're not going to have this this instant success, if I could put it that way. This get-richqu scheme that that the devil's trying to feed people. He's trying to to to smooth over this this well, that's good enough. Nobody else is living like that. Nobody's still, you know, even the message churches, they're they're bickering. Some of them are bickering back and forth and we've got those that that believe in emotion and and those that believe that you have emotion. You're Let me tell you something. I've never seen nor has brother Harry or anybody else. Nobody's ever seen emotion heal the sick. Nope. So we shouldn't get emotional. No. I said emotion doesn't heal the sick. Emotion doesn't deliver. But I tell you what, if you get delivered, you're gonna have some emotion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you get if you get healed, you're going to have some emotion. &gt;&gt; That's where it comes from. That's where the balance is, brothers and sisters. We're not focusing on one side or the other. We know that they're both united in the fact that he's my deliverer, and I'm happy about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I and and I'm going to express that happiness. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Oh, heavenly father, Lord, I believe with all my heart, Lord Jesus, that you have spoke, Lord, if to no one else but myself, Lord. It seems so hard in lessa these days, Lord, this this old flesh. And it seems ironic, Lord, that we've got all these temptations around us. And we find that you yourself tempt us to see where our faith is, to see if we really believe. And Lord, you're not doing it out of meanness. You're conditioning us, Lord. And we can go home, Lord. I know there's people here, Lord, that are facing impossible situations. Lord, maybe it's their in their own life. Maybe it's with a sickness. Maybe it's with overcoming. Maybe Lord Jesus, they see in your word where you said raise them up in the way that they should go and when they get older they will not depart. And Lord, they're they seem so far away from where you called them in the way that we raised them. But Lord, is there anything too hard for God? Is there any circumstance, Lord Jesus, that we as a bride won't be able to overcome? &gt;&gt; No, Lord. I know with all my heart there's nothing too hard for you. Lord, help us to look to your word, to your promise, and embrace, Lord Jesus, what you've called us to. And Lord, even when our our mind is one set one way and you go the opposite direction, Lord, I know as the bride of Christ, we we say, \"All right.\" But sometimes it hurts even still. Sometimes we can't understand it. Lord, just give us grace. Lord, we love you. I pray, Father, that you would just help each and every one in this building tonight, Lord, to look to the author and the finisher of our faith to go ahead and finish our faith. whatever may come Lord we love you and we thank you for it Lordes &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. Amen. Can we sing uh pass me nod? You want to sing with me just a minute? If you have a need tonight, he's here. &gt;&gt; Well, you say, \"Brother John, maybe he's tempting me.\" Maybe he is. But at any moment he could deliver you. &gt;&gt; Maybe tonight's your night. &gt;&gt; Oh, pass me now, oh gentle Savior. Hear my heart cry. Let's worship him now. Why others out are calling?

God always knows what's going on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He always does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not in dark. He's not surprised. &gt;&gt; He knows what you have need of. &gt;&gt; He's not shocked of your shortcomings and your faults and your failures. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he's also not shocked &gt;&gt; of your faith &gt;&gt; and your belief in him. &gt;&gt; He knows who you are better than you know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know, I got lots of pictures of my kids all over the house. Not so many of me. There's a reason for that. Was, you know, when I forget what they were like when they were little, I can go find a picture And sometimes we forget who we are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we're saying, God, I'm not I'm not anything like you called me to be. &gt;&gt; I fall so short. &gt;&gt; What's the first thing he does? Brother Harry pulls out that picture of you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; This is it. This is you. &gt;&gt; You see it in my word. This is you. &gt;&gt; He ain't never going to forget. &gt;&gt; And that's what he sees. He always sweet sees that. Cuz when they get bigger, they ain't always so sweet. &gt;&gt; I wasn't either. And neither were you. &gt;&gt; But every now and then, it's good to remember what they were before the foundation of the world. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he just pulls out that picture. I open up that word and I say, \"Oh, mama, that's me. &gt;&gt; Mama, that's me.\" &gt;&gt; I see myself in that word. &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have any faults? No. That's when I need it the most is when I'm falling short and I'm I'm failing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I need to look into his promise and see that he sees me the same way he and and he's wanting me to see who I am. Amen. God bless you, brother Justin. I appreciate you all. God bless. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many you can say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord this evening. Amen. We'll sing this song as we get ready to go. Let's just stay stay in worship just for a couple more minutes. I know it's late and kids getting back to school, but let's just sing. He didn't throw the clay away. You know, Brother John's talking about he every time you stumble and fall and that's the only song I could really think of. So, let's sing a song. He is the potter. I am the clay molded in his image is how he wants me to stay. But I stumble and I fall and my vessel breaks. He just picks up all the broken pieces. He doesn't throw the clay away. And over and over he molds me and makes me into his likeness. He fashions the way I am today. And it's all because Jesus did all the clay. empty and broken. I came back to him, a vessel unworthy. I've been so scared by sin. But he did not despair. He started over again. Oh, and I'm so eating the road clay. [Music] Now, he knows me and makes me into his lik of honor I am today. And it's all because Jesus in the clear way. Now over and over. He holds me and makes me into his likess. He fashions the clay of the soul of honor I am today. And it's all because Jesus didn't throw the clay away. [Music] He is the potter and I am the clay. Molded in his image is how he wants me to stay. But when I stumble and I fall and my vessel breaks, he just picks up all the broken pieces. He doesn't throw the clay away. [Music] Now over and over. He holds me and makes me into his likeness. He fashions the That's all of our earth. That's what I am today. And is all because Jesus didn't throw a clear away. [Music] Now over and over.

got over the hill yet have you we're talking about the hill of Calvary of course than once people really come in contact with that reality it changes our life doesn't it I'm so happy that I'm I was able as a boy to be able to see that reality years ago and I don't mind telling you I love him tonight more than I've ever loved him greet you tonight sure missed you all good to see you appreciate the goodness of the Lord to us let's turn to U First Peter chapter 1 tonight Lord willing I guess we're still having the we're having the question answers tomorrow night for the Youth at 6:30 we'll be having it in here and um the youth asked me if if um if we would do this so um some of the questions I've had for a month or so some at least three weeks and I've been studying on them for for a bit so last Wednesday night I was going to preach what I'm going to preach tonight and then we was going to do question answers on Thursday night but we got snowed out of course and couldn't do it but what I want to speak to you tonight on is what is the Holy Ghost I'm sure every one of you would surely be able to give me an answer what you think it is no doubt not just a little bit but on the latest Foundation tonight we're because the first question that I want to answer tomorrow night is how can I know G so the Lord just put it on my heart that if we want to be able to know we've got it might need a refresher what it is so we can know what it is got know uh what it is in your life and before we start let me just say it this way the Holy Ghost is not jumping the Holy Ghost is not sh the Holy Ghost is not in motion right the Holy Ghost is not speaking in tongues but the Holy Ghost does all so what is the Holy Ghost it's the spirit of God in us so to say that the Holy Ghost is shouting and say that God is a shout or God is a tongue or God is a feeling or God is an emotion but we know that God is a spirit and the Holy Ghost is the attribute of God could be divided divided so the spirit of Christ which refers to what the Old Testament prophets had if you notice we read here in First Peter tonight that it does not say Jesus because Jesus the human body of God never existed in the old so it's not Jesus that Elijah had on Jesus that Moses had in him but it was the spirit of what Christ CH anointed one First Peter 1 verse 10 so the question answers are for alls and we'll be streaming it for those of you that like to stream as well and I believe you'll be blessed amen so if you can listen this careful now 1 Peter 1: 10 of which salvation the prophets have inquired and search diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify Peter says he doesn't say Jesus the humanity of God was in them but the spirit of Christ and it was actually in the prophets that come in them like it did Ezekiel but it did not seal their soul so that's what Peter called the spirit of Christ when it testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow so the sufferings and then the glory that should follow of course that order and the glory is going to be the glory of the Resurrection but not only that but the glory of the church but it testified before him the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you wow so that first church they Le in vir that's the way God started his church that's way in his church so it was reported unto you by them which have preached the gospel unto you now listen this carefully with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into okay which things the Angels desire to look into now look at the screen there at what the word look means to stoop to a same in order to look at it if you can imagine in your mind ton that every one of you that have the Holy Ghost in your soul it is so overwhelm in and so great to the angels of God that they actually sto and they're looking we should never take Grant look at that meaning to look at with the head bowed forward to look into with the body bent so they don't just stand up real proud and sophisticated but they actually are looking they're trying to understand what in the world how God love them people we're with you all that Amen to suit and to look into metaphorically to look carefully into to inspect curiously yeah so it's like you're looking at something you just you got that look on your face in bewilderment you think wow body armorock orange Clementine wow I wonder what this going tast like and the angels are looking at God deals with us DAV think how can he how could he forgive them how can he put up with and what they have he in them I hope you understand that God uses the church as a school to teach his angels W to look carefully into to expect curiously one of who would become acquainted with something so they're so curious that they like to become acquainted with with that was the Angel's desire to look into so here it portrays the stretching of the neck and the bending of the body to be able to gaze upon some wonderful s that are struck with all yeah as you have the Holy Ghost on thank you Lord thank you Lord father that just about leaves us speechless to think that what you have done in human beings is so great I'm so curious that the angels of God study it in such a curious manner to try to relate to it father I pray you would help us toight would you open our understanding may we be able to leave this place [Music] over and becomes a demon there is no Redemption for the demon ad then demons could live inside of us when we were lost and we can be redeemed but that spirit that was inhabiting our could not be so they look at it in such a curious Manner and try to understand so the Redemption of the Saints and then also this infinite being holds such Marvel to them of his work not only Redemption for us but his work of incarnation that he would come to the Earth and become one of us and so much that he would bleed and die in pain and sorrow and Agony and scream from the cross my God my God why is s foren and they still are looking in this curious manner to understand every generation is different every age of what they go through I wonder how curious they must be tonight of us in this age the darkest most terrible age a person could live and they look with bewilderment at us as God deals with us in Mercy and Grace saves us sanctifies us fills us with the Holy Ghost and then they see us still as humans and we make mistakes and fall short of the glory of God and they see the plan of reconciliation that they say father please forgive me I'm so sorry and they see the mercy of God as it eliminates that sin never to be remembered against us again and they're looking at and thinking how that how can you do that and he don't even remember it how could it be that he that he just totally obliterates that sin and it'll never be remembered against again and they're looking with their bodies bent and their neck stretched and they're trying to comprehend you think the great work of what God has done is it any Wonder Satan hates the True Church of the Living God w't you notice in Ephesians 3:9 that Paul says and to make men all all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ notice the order now Jesus Humanity Christ anointed so anointed Humanity now Paul is bringing it from the stage of the invisible logos to show us that that invisible logos became a man and was crowned with Glory the anointing to the intent that now to the principalities and Power ERS in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God so again principalities is the beginning of the creation of angelic beings Aro so it's the first one in order so Paul broke into it in a little different way than God allowed Peter to and he says to the intent so the purpose is that the principalities and powers and Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God and manifold is the word variegated yall know what a variegated plant is so a variegated plant will have green and light green and I have green and white it's actually and there'll be couple of three different colors sometimes in there and you never know exactly how each Leaf will be so Paul says this is what God did God chose to manifest his manifold wisdom not in angels not in charans but by the church the church the Ecclesia of God the called out of God people who leave their homes and gather in a public place and by their own walk and they're the variegated body of God some were drunk some were alive some were this and that and God brings them all together by the variegated manifold wisdom of God and the angels are still trying to figure it out how can this be how can he love them right now he says that it not be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God the angels are not participants in Salvation the Angels do not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Angels do not experience deity in the way you now in a simplified form the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your soul is your portion of deity yes sir from the God Amen it is your portion of deity that once you get in here it will be yours forever you will never that's right it is always yours now remember this is what the Holy Ghost is it is the part of God I know it's difficult for us even looking at the Father and Son relationship because we judge it by human terms and human perception so you would look and say well father and son so here's Brother D Swanson he is a father and then we look at his sons and say well them sons and they they look a little bit different than day and our makeup is a little bit different than the day and that's the way we judge God him but remember Jesus said God is a spirit God is not a man God is Not Not a Human Being right God is a spirit and God never had a permanent human body unto Jesus his word his son come on the earth then from this part of the earth I will redeem the rest of it will this part now this was God's Humanity he was both human and God is that right so the truth then of God was made manifest in the human body the Lord Jesus so now the manifold wisdom of God will be made manifest not just in Jesus but actually in the church so the Holy Angels are taught by the instrumentality of the church how in the world could a bunch of weaklings a bunch of former Sinners former Liars drug addicts everything of the world you can imagine and God would use them to teach Angels you imagine God speaking to them and say you want to know more about me watch me in my church you want to understand me greater you archangels you cherubims you seraphim you zoom Watch How I deal with my bride Hallelujah so they catch a view of God's Supreme love in a way that they didn't see it in the universe so the prophet tells us to his opinion the first thing that God made was Angels then he become into the position or the object of worship which is God before that he was the Eternal the Eternal so there was no one to worship him so it wasn't God because God is the object of worship so there had to be something to worship him so he created angels and actually the Angels the Fallen Angels actually fell before the foundation of the world was ever Le so they were there when he started creating this aspect of the universe and they never saw with the trillions of Angels the billions of stars and they never saw the great display of his wisdom in the way that they see it and you and I so here the church then becomes God's school for Angelic beings notice in Hebrews chap 1:14 are they not all ministering Spirits talking about the angels of God are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of Salvation so their Ministry is for The Heirs on the earth that's going to receive salvation so this within itself makes them more Curious to be able to look into it I wonder how many times them angels have been around us I wonder how many accidents that the angels of God have stopped you from having when Satan laid a a snare or trap or whatever and an angel of God stood between you and that truck or that car or maybe you got out and you was fixing a head somewhere and and you forgot something back at the house and you had to go back and get it and if you would have been 5 minutes earlier you've been right in the middle of a terrible terrible accident God has appointed the angels to watch over you not only to watch but to minister wonder what they're ministering so they minister to those that are Heirs of Salvation so they comprehend they're trying to look imagine these angels they some of the same ones that were assigned to Noah they were the same ones that was assigned to Paul and assigned to the first church age on down to the seventh and they're still pondering and looking at what God did through Paul and looking at us today they're saying they're similar but they're so different look at them and what they're dealing with they're living in the the most terrible age that's ever been on the earth and yet it seems like they're at their wits in sometimes and they don't know what to do but father will allow me to be able to give them a little boost and they don't even know where it comes from but it's like they're all alone and he'll he'll send a message to me and I'm their angel to watch over them and I will get down near where they are are and from my being projects a supernatural strength and they're thinkinking lord I can't go another day I don't think I can put up with anything else and all of a sudden I'm allowed to send a charge through them like a battery and where they were standing there with their heads bowed and crying and in the next moment tears are running out of their eyes and they're saying thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus they didn't even know it was me standing right there by him amen oh Hallelujah to God so what is the Holy Ghost you see the Holy Ghost is not Jesus the human body of God living in US you understand that so God did not divide the human body and give you an eye you an ear you a piece of hair there was not enough Humanity in that body the body itself served as a carrier of the sacrificial blood but the token was not the body of Jesus now listen carefully the token was not even the chemistry of the blood but the token was the spirit which was inside the body that was not enough chemistry in the body of the Lord Jesus if you'd give every one of us a drop of that blood as we say and the songwriters write about it it makes a good song but it's not really true the blood literally is not applied to Your Heart Right There was not enough chemistry inside that body to do it but God was able to hide in the blood cell so what is the Holy Ghost the attribute of God which could be divided you understand the Eternal himself and that original attribute could not divide himself into multiple portions and send it around the world I wonder how many people tonight on the face of the Earth have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's the exact same holy ghost that Peter got on the day of Pentecost and let me just say this tonight in case you're wondering you late folks don't have a lesser Holy Ghost than what preachers have got and US regular preachers don't have a lesser Holy Ghost than what the prophet had it's the same Holy Ghost right but it's our calling and so on that makes us different you young people have got the same Holy Ghost so there's not like a young people version of the Holy Ghost so there in heaven you know God's got a special young people version and that's why young people can listen to rock and roll gospel because they're Holy Ghost allows them it's exactly the same holy ghost that us old people have got so if it is is it should be the same way we should act the same way now let me just go on and say so then the Chinese people that get the Holy Ghost get the same Holy Ghost then the Mexican people right get the same Holy Ghost uh uh the Native Americans get the same Holy Ghost of people in in Czechoslovakia and Poland and all around the world exact same Holy Ghost is that right so then you see whenever God sends a message globally around the world and sends the spirit of Christ into the hearts of those True Believers then this is why the standard of Holiness righteousness Purity and holding to that same gospel can be the same no matter where you are unless of course you hold on to your tradition over the top of the teaching of the word now you find that of course you go into different places and you'll find that they hold on to their original tradition which you're not supposed to do it's you're supposed to be baptized into one mystical body by the Holy Ghost so let's look now so how the Holy Ghost came Acts chapter 2 you're all familiar with it how the Holy Ghost came Acts 2 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting wow what a strange way to get the Holy Ghost they wasn't even at an altar nobody was beating them on the back nobody was taking that g no they were all setting now listen to me this is the only time in the book of Acts that it happened quite this way now it happened of course in Cornelius it actually happened in Acts 19 but nowhere else does it mention exactly in this same way of a rushing Mighty Wind Now read your Bible and you'll find that out watch what God did suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it bu all the house the house the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire now this is the original breaking up of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so it was like this big Pillar of Fire comes into the upper room and he started whipping around in the room and a lick went off and went clothing tongues of fire begin to set upon each of them notice what it says and it set upon each of them so he didn't say that the fire the burning fire actually went in them read your Bible but it sat so it came and set upon them this is the original dividing of God separating himself s into this attribute where that this is the first time it's ever happened since the dawn of creation that more than a prophet more than just one man in the age would be able to have the spirit of Christ that would testify of what he's going to do but here they are 120 people and it's visible God wanted them to be able to see it that's what I said God never done this in another place in the book of Acts but this was a visible appearing so here you've been looking around 120 of them and you have saw pillar fire there lick over him one over her one over him one over her one over a young person one over another person and it was visible God wanted them to see what he was doing he was dividing himself into this attribute now notice in verse four and they were all filled wow notice how it happens though suddenly there come a sound of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire and set upon each of them and then they were all filled with the Holy Ghost one sign leading to another signs to get their attention no wonder that Paul in the book of Corinthians talked about tongues and prophet prophecy about one being assigned to the believer and one was assigned to the unbeliever and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues now notice they were filled with the Holy Ghost and they begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance I love the meaning of this word I can't believe it I honest cannot believe it that I've been preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost now for how many every years I've been preaching and I had never actually looked up the word utterance until today but boy am I glad I did today I want you to look at what this word means speak force not a word of everyday speech but one belonging to dignified and an elevated discourse and the spirit was giving them a dignified elevated discourse well I reckon this is a bunch of ignoramuses they were ignorant and unlearned can you imagine as they begin to speak this way and they were looking around and they were speaking Arabian they were speaking Spanish they were speaking Chalan they were speaking Hebrew they were speaking all these different languages and they were looking at each other and just speaking in these languages they never knew these languages but it was the spirit of God giving them utterance now I realize there's people around the message today they say we're Way Beyond that and we don't need that you show me where he took it out I'll preach the same thing now I do believe that as the people of God we should never major on a minor but I am enough of a musician to know that if a songwriter writes a song and puts miners in the song even if you don't think they belong there and you sing them without it the song will not sound the same without them and it just so happens that the author of the New Testament song put minors in with Majors so when he minored I want to minor with him when he majored I want to Major if he diminishes if he goes to a seventh or a ninth or an argumented whatever he does I want to follow it I to be honest with you I really don't care if you think it sounds good or not because I'm not playing for you I'm playing for him amen that's the way you should look at it as well I'm not here tonight every one of you should look at it exactly the same I'm not here tonight to just necessarily please the church I'm not here tonight to please my wife my husband my family I'm here to please God if some of us would get that out of our mind I think we'd Worship the Lord a little a little bit more than what we do but we're scared to death somebody's going to think we're Pentecostal I'm scared they're going to think I ain't all right now notice in verse 38 whenever Peter begins and the the the 120 go out and the people out there they look at them and they're acting so peculiar and odd and they said they're drunk now do you honestly think they would have said they were drunk had they been setting like this you see us in the message many of us have quit saying amen and instead we nod I wonder what hadie R would have got from God if she would have nodded you see the prophet did not tell her hady because you nodded but he said you said the right thing God wants to hear your amens God wants to hear you see it's not just the preacher that wants to hear them God wants to hear them now Peter's in and they move outside and they're kind of Staggering around and you know my goodness what in the world is wrong with them people and they said well they're trunk and they said no no no it ain't that this is just the third hour of the day while the saloons and taverns ain't even open yet it's the morning time so this is the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel so they begin to say well what what must me what must we do them to get what y'all got then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost H what' he say in the name of Jesus Christ you mean to tell me that he stands right there and says the exact opposite of what Jesus said in Matthew 2819 no he actually said the same thing cuz father ain't a name I'm a father but that ain't my name how many men in here our fathers yes sir so is Father your name brother Matthew so the children go to say father father father father how many of us men would say yes yes so Peter says you got to repent you got to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and your children to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call acts 5:32 for we Are Witnesses of these Saints so is also the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that that obey him which is the main reason more people don't have it to them that obey him so this is how it comes acts 8:14 now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent they sent I want you to know Peter and John didn't go on their own read your Bible they didn't go on their own they were sent praise the Lord they sent unto them Peter and John who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was fallen on none of them only they oh no they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus oh my goodness you mean to tell me the Apostolic Church baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus amen is this your Bible Well if you haven't been baptized that way then I ask you tonight why acts 10:43 to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins notice through his name verse 44 while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which had heard the word now want you notice in the three accounts that we're reading here about the Holy Ghost coming none of them are exactly identical amen isn't it amazing though how that we want everybody to get it the same way we did and we think boy if you didn't shout you didn't get it if you don't run you didn't get it if you don't speak in tongues if you don't jerk your head a certain way you didn't get it that's not following the book of Acts pattern well come on now and they of the circumcision in which believed were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles now listen to me the Jews were very very set in their National thinking in one sense of the word they were still yet to be enlightened that there was a gentile bride they were shocked Harry they were shocked astonished you mean them dogs got the Holy Ghost this the same one that we got how is that PO possible we are Abraham's chosen race we are Abraham's chosen people how in the world could they get the Holy Ghost come on you see the mystery of the Gentile bride had not yet been made known and God wanted to prove to them Jews look I'm giving the Holy Ghost the exact same one you got to them Gentiles aren't you glad praise the Lord and as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost now I want you to notice what they done for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God but ain't it amazing in every other place it does and say that they spoke in tongues wonder why this is significant because they was looking at it still through the tongue aspect and God said okay I see you're hung up on the tongues so I'm going to let this Bunch speak in tongues too so it'll convince you all that they got the same thing you got did they have to to have the Holy Ghost no oh my for they heard them speak with tongue and magnify God then answered Peter can any forbid water that these should not be baptized which has received the Holy Ghost as well as we now watch this is God pouring out of himself and he's dispersing himself and the angels of God now this is what's going on in the the visible realm but in the invisible realm now the angels of God are being divided so it's like a subdivision being built in a mystical Kingdom so the angels are being divided and they're not only now just watching Jews but some of the angels for the first time in their existence of their creation they're watching over heathens former Gentiles heathens you imagine the angels of God being assigned to former Gentiles which were idolators oh my and they never they never had done this before it was Daniel you know it was it was some great king over in the Old Testament it was some great king Uzziah or Joshua and for the first time in their existence they're being assigned to Gentiles praise the Lord and he said unto them now watch this is Paul going to the upper coast of Ephesus and the prophet you know in order so we'd be able to relate to it he he said he found a bunch of Baptist up there and they hadn't got the Holy Ghost yet so he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they were some message people and they said unto him we've not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost now I find this absolutely amazing because they were following John the Baptist two dispensations had changed and they were behind two dispensations so they hadn't even heard of the Holy Ghost which again I find strange since John had it from his mother's womb his mother got it and his father got it and they hadn't even heard about it so it goes to show you that you can follow a prophet's message and still not have the Holy Ghost now this is pretty pitiful to me oh my and he said unto them unto what notice what unto what then were you baptized and they said unto John's baptism so see there are two dispensations behind so John did not baptize in a name now John was not the first one to baptize the ases baptized the zealots baptized so there was different ones that baptized but John was the first one to baptize point in unto a Messianic Advent and he'd say You Must Believe on him which is to come on him which is to come he didn't have no name cuz you weren't sure who he was yet so these people now several years after the Lord Jesus had come and gone several years after the Holy Ghost had been given and they were still baptizing people in this same way you've got to believe on him which is to come but there was some seed among them Baptist there still might be today praise the Lord and he said unto them then what were you baptized and they said unto John baptism then said Paul John verely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him now Paul can give the name that is on Christ Jesus know how he places the order here now Christos anointed Humanity so it's anointed Humanity Christ Jesus you know that the New Testament when the angel of God appeared to Mary and also on to Joseph and spoke his name it did not call him Lord Jesus Christ he was not called that until the book of Acts why he was CHR Christos the anointed one out the river he was named Jesus Jesus the human Jesus when the father came in him at the river he was jeus Christos but he was Lord Jesus Christ after he raised from the dead for God has made this same Jesus both Lord and Christ Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy Ghost oh praise be to God notice so here them Paul tells them John baptized the people and tells them what he said they should believe on him which should come which is that is on Christ Jesus and when they heard this they were baptized wow so is there anyone here tonight or anyone that will listen to this if you can show me in the book of Acts or in recorded history of the first century of the church second century as well where the original Church baptized using the titles of father son Holy Ghost I will stand here next Wednesday night and say I was wrong right or of course you can let me re-baptize you tonight cuz you ain't going to find it this is the way the true church baptized praise the Lord now notice how they get the Holy Ghost and when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and they spake with tongues and prophesied now notice different from what happened in the upper room and different from what happened when Peter spake the word and they spake the word and when he done it then they just receive the Holy Ghost by by hearing the word but here and this is where the Prophet picks it up of course and he said the apostolic way of receiving the Holy Ghost is to have hands laid on you but notice it does not say in Acts two that when they got the holy ghost that they prophesied but these Believers in the upper coast of Ephesus did so which one are we going to use to say well that's the right way all of them are all of them are a't it amazing that God didn't make every one of them exactly the same so this and spoken tongue this and spoken tongues this and prophesied this and shouted don't you understand what Satan's trying to do he's trying to make a denominational thing out of even receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the message people that lean more toward the emotion and the ecstatic explosion of all of that everybody that don't have that you ain't got it the ones that are more still on the other side and they produce stillborn children well bless God it's a you know the Holy Ghost without sensation you don't have no sensation and no emotion and somehow you just grow into it you know you're just one day you'll just wake up and realize that you've been born again how in the world can that ever happen how can a man that's as lost as lost can be not realize that God has changed his nature oh praise the Lord Now watch how the prophet dealt with what the Holy Ghost actually is and what is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost it is the spirit of Christ in you now before we read I just like to say a few commoning words here what is the Holy Ghost it's a seal what is the Holy Ghost it's a covenant What is the Holy Ghost it's a sign what is the Holy Ghost then it's the spirit of Jesus Christ in you so then it's not emotion it's not shouting though it will bring all types of effects some spoke in tongues some prophesied and yet it's amazing now look you know I believe in Emotion I believe in worshiping God and yet none of those scriptures that we read when they receive the Holy Ghost do we find where any of them as we say today shouted now brother Donnie don't you believe in that I do but I do not believe in making shouting an Evidence of the Holy Ghost you won't find that in the book of Acts as a matter of fact you won't even find where they shouted in the way that we think shouting is don't you believe in the quickening power of God I do and I don't like it when we make a denomination out of it that's exactly what some people are doing they're making a denomination what do you mean a denomination it's where everybody has to do it this way right here because this way's been declared my men it's not declared in the book of acts if it is you show me you preachers that won't like this you send me the scriptures and I'll apologize show me show me what they shouted and they they did all of that I believe in all of that but it is not an Evidence any more than other evidences that we make well somebody say amen and we can see how that these these different examples that God gave and every time that it came it was a little bit different well someone say well how did you get the Holy Ghost I got his sitting right here and her preacher preach the word well they might go up to Ephesus said brother tell me how you got the Holy Ghost I'll tell you what Paul laid his hands on me well my Lord what in the world you must not be near as much of a Believer as I am I sat right there and heard that word hallelujah you know how we are about that I sat right there and heard that word GL to God I'll tell you one thing I'm so spiritual I sat right there and heard the word of God and I sat right there man alive that eternal life entered into me and the other say well Paul laid his hands on me and I got it does it really matter does it really matter whether you were sitting or standing or rolling in the floor like a Holy Roller does it really matter the most important thing is what you got it you got it so whether you spoke in tongues and prophesied or you fell out in the floor you got it how do I know it changed you forever now watch brother Brandon preached this in 1959 and he preached the first service what is the Holy Ghost second service you know what is it given for and then the third service he preached how will you know you got it which I find it so amazing that they recorded it but it's never yet been released and then yet he does question answers so you saying isn't that strange isn't that odd that he would actually allow that to be released well let me say it to you this way it was not released in 1959 but the mystery of it was going to be released when he reti titled it and called it the token so how you going to know well brother Donnie if you're a woman your hair go out and you have a long dress and and if you're a brother you you'll uh you know you dress this way and that way and Men of course won't wear dresses to church and Men won't wear you know this and that look like a woman and that's the way you know it no that's not the way you'll know it that is part of it but you will be changed from what you were unto a brand new creature in Christ Jesus and the church said amen now he said what did the Holy Spirit what did it come for what did he come in you for what did he come in me for now listen it's quite simple was to continue the works of God to continue the works of God now remember part of these things were limited when the Lord Jesus come on the earth he's going to now sh share things of nature that had not been done since Adam lost it in the fall he's going to share things over animals and over nature and over storms that had not been replicated since the Fall In the Garden of Eden he's going to reverse nature he's going to reverse the cycle of death and go to a man's grave and he's been laying there for 4 days and his nose had fallen in and the skin worms were eating on his body and by the spoken word of God he's going to call that man's name and he'll come out of that grave is that right now he didn't just do that for himself and said now look at me you all can't do this but I want you to see what I am but what you all do you just go to church and you try to live right and you try to be be as good good as you can but he said now I'm showing you all what to do and I want you to act like me talk like me preach like me live like me raise the Dead Like Me cast out devils like me yeah now remember he says here that the Holy Ghost was given that we might continue the works of God remember the blind man and St John 11 whenever the disciples said Lord who s this man or his parents and Jesus said neither one but that The Works of God might be made manifest and then of course in another place in John they asked him and said Lord what might we do to do the works of God and he said this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent so the works of God then incorporates healing miraculous but it also means you're able to get in line behind the godall leader of the age and a god call Pastor and so on and so on that's also part of the works of God Jesus knew every woman was not going to cast out Devils Hallelujah come here devil I'm ready for you he knew the daughters of God was not going to do that th and sharan went to Brother Bram said brother brandham I fasted and fasted to cast out devils and I still can't do it he said you're not called to do such he said but you're called to fast and pray for those who are called to cast them out and you said well I can't do nothing brother Donnie's called to do that and brother Joe and brother Daryl and brother Joel these other brother Jonathan these other brothers that are called whoever they are but I can't do nothing yes you can you can pray for me and you can pray for the rest of these brothers because we're not dealing with a little video saying when you're dealing with a demon you're dealing with a fallen angel oh what a comfort it is to know that the saints of God are praying for you so what do we do we continue the works of God which is what building a church having church membership really so it's not just going to church every now and then whether you feel like it or not and and you know you drop a little money in and and you really don't believe in ping ties and you really don't believe in walking right and doing right and you know you just you just go to church that's the work of God that's the way Jesus did the Bible says that Jesus on the Sabbath day went to the synagogue which was his custom so lets me know a lot of the folks around the message don't have the custom of Jesus cuz Jesus went to church and if they really believe what them tapes say they don't because their feet testify they're voting with their feet not with their mouths then they would know exactly that the prophet tells us even Christ The Mystery of God revealed that if God is in your heart you can't wait for them doors to open you see the reason people don't feel that way they're missing God in their heart well come on somebody if God is in your heart you can't wait for them doors to come open and he said if you don't feel that way I tell you it's time you got to pray it come on somebody let's say what the tapes say praise the Lord now I love the way that he goes on down in this paragraph a little further and he said the Jesus that sends you goes with you and is in you and if that Spirit living in Jesus Christ made him do and act the way he did you'll have some general idea of how it will do what it's in you because that life cannot change it'll go from body to body but it cannot change its nature listen what it is now for it is God your baptism of the Holy Ghost is your portion of God now you all educate me for a bit dogs bring forth help me now educate me some of y'all been wanting to teach me a few things so help me now cats bring forth horses bring forth so what would God bring forth if he brought forth children say it come on you you can do it come on that's it come on come on honey say it say it what would God bring forth gods in humanity but you see we look so much at our Humanity we suppress the Divine Supernatural and what you and I suppress the angels of God are looking at in amazement and they just are mesmerized by about what's inside of us and we're saying well I ain't nobody I don't ever amount to nothing I guess you know I just make so many mistakes and they're looking at every one of them mistakes and you make and they're not even thinking that about you at all they think don't they know what he told them don't they know what he said that he don't even see their mistakes don't they know that that blood that he shed on the cross don't they know that it ain't no wonder that they look at us and they thinking you know I how how could he love them he gave his life he gave his word he gave his Bible then he sends a message with over 1100 sermon and then they still question does he even love them it's a there's said what in the world is it going to take for them bunch of Noe heads that's Kentucky language translated into Angelic language I guess what's he going to take for them to realize how much he cares and they're looking at you daily and thinking if you only knew what I knew about you thank you Lord praise be to God notice this what is the Holy Ghost again what is the Holy Ghost it's Christ in you the comforter that's the Holy Spirit when the comforter has come he'll do the things that I've done while the comforter is in me so it's a very same father that was in Jesus except he had the fullness all of that fullness was in him but it was the fullness that was going to be divided think of how great he is he could divide himself into millions of parts and he is no less that great August presence around the throne is no less being subdivided into how many ever pieces that he is and he's still as great upon the throne as he ever was before he divided himself now here he is he he on the throne and yet he's on the earth and he's in the United States and he's in Ohio and he's an Africa he's in India and and the angels of God are looking and say I didn't know he was this big I didn't know he was this great I saw that light I saw that shakina I saw that Glory I didn't realize you mean every time they get the Holy Ghost that's him that's him inside of them oh my God how great he is how wonderful he is and they're just saiding oh how awesome how wonderful he is he's everywhere I didn't know he's everywhere they knew he was Everywhere by his omnipotence and by his omnipotence but they didn't know he was going to be everywhere by dividing himself and baptizing himself into a little white boy and a little black girl and a little Indian a little Native American and a swed and a German and so baptizing with the love of God that they by nationality might have great differences but they'll be able to put their arms around one another and say brother I love you sister I love you why it's God don't you understand God in Me will love God in you that don't mean My Flesh will love everything about yours I'm going to say something shocking it don't mean you're going to like everything about me but if God's in you you can't hate God in Me and if God's in me and in you I can't hate God in you we might disagree on the flesh but how can God hate [Applause] God so the Holy Ghost is a seal it's a sign it's a comforter watch paragraph 16 what is the Holy Ghost it's an advocate it's an advocate what does it do oh oh Jesus it has Mercy it stands in your place it does things you can't do or say Brother D you're talking about perfect love and all that I just can't do that of course you can't I can't either none of us can do it there's only one that could do that and that was the Lord Jesus but God wants to come in Us in such a way well you say how come some people can do it easier than others it's because they've learned how to submit the key is the more we submit the more he can take over oh praise God it does things you can't do it's a perpetuation for your sins don't you understand you don't need an altar in the church in the sense with blood on it and mercy you make a mistake tomorrow say oh goodness I've got to run by 490 okalona Road and be able to have the brother still at me in the sanctuary so I go up in the front and kneel down no you packed your altar Oh Glory to God you pack your altar and you pack your eternity your eternity is there you pack the blood The Mercy Seat the forgiver The Advocate you carry it with you so you don't have to wait till Sunday to come back and say Lord I'm so sorry I messed up on on Thursday and I've been waiting all week Lord to get back I'll tell you friend you don't have to wait till Thursday evening you don't have to wait till Friday you just bow your head Lord please forgive me I'm sorry Lord please forgive me and the advocate in you will plead your case hallelujah hallelujah oh my it's your righteousness it's your healing you know but friend I I I guess I just I don't understand I I I guess I just don't understand why is it that so many want to just preach the holy ghost that it's all healing it's all miracles it's all signs it's all wonders it's all emotion what about this part right here and preach the Holy Ghost in such a place brother if you look crosseyed to somebody you're about lost you ain't even got it you mess up one time and you make one mistake brother you ain't got the Holy Ghost well if he's not going to have to be an advocate for me why in the world do I need an advocate if after I get it boy I'm fine from that day on I'll never make a mother mistake you ain't preaching the Bible holy ghost on well somebody said amen it's a perpetuation for your bleep what there's a brave person here who was that you brother me thank you so it's a perpetuation for your sins Lord have mercy you don't mean to tell me people of the Holy Ghost is going to fall short of the glory of God it's your righteousness brother Donnie I'll have you to know glory to God I got her 40 years ago I ain't sin since you just sin right then you big liar who do you think you're fooling only yourself cuz you for sure ain't fooling us and you ain't fooling the devil it's your righteousness listen what it is it's your healing you're sick here tonight your healer is living in [Music] you praise be to God if your faith can only contact that what is in you Jesus Christ the healer is in you amen it's your healer it's your life it's your Resurrection it's our all that God has for you he's an advocate what is the Holy Ghost the rest come unto me all you that labor near heavy lad and I will give you rest what is he the one that comes in you gives you peace your sign your comforter oh praise God comforted that rest sealed if you feel the least TG don't turn it away what is the Holy Ghost God in you what's it for to continue his work among his people to bring his church together wow to a place in this day far beyond Lutheran Methodist and Pentecostal and to a place to adoption and rapturing Grace this is the only way the bride will ever be able to get together friends we are as divided now if not more so than we have ever been in this message I hate to tell you it's a shame really it's a shame we are so divided and so split up it it it's heartbreaking it's absolutely heart heartbreaking preachers preaching at one another and throwing quotes at one another and throwing scriptures at one another and churches divided young people divided it's pitiful who's the blame for a lot of it preachers are to blame for a lot of it Amen brother Donnie you going to keep on Sir you're going to get me fired but he'll fire me up if I don't tell it so I'd rather y'all Farm it than him Farm me up noce into a place to adoption of rapture Grace that when this part of the church listen what he's waiting on when the spirit moves into this church here it'll just raise and it'll bring forth all the redeemed that's touched that Spirit no wonder brother Daryl the angels of God are looking at it and say father now you're you're if I understand this right you're not bringing no Resurrection until everyone I'm get to Holy Ghost is that right that's right and according to what them preachers are saying down there you imagine Angels listening to preachers to be updated on what's Happening Lord have mercy so according to what them men are saying you're you're going to bring your people to together for rapturing Faith and it will be their faith when they come to The Headstone crying Grace Grace that when when they come to that spot when they arrive there it'll be such a cosmic upheaval that the dead will be raised father are we getting that right and father said yep that's what's going to happen my church will actually arrive to that place of maturity and the devil's holding his sides laughing you got to be kidding me I don't never happened uh devil maybe I should take you back to Acts chapter 2 on the day of Pentecost them men that you laughed at and said this church won't last three or four days but when that Pillar of Fire come down and divided himself They Live Like Jesus they healed the sick like Jesus they died like Jesus they preach the gospel they rais the dead that same Lord Jesus said he will have a bride in the last day Hallelujah he will have a bride in the last day that will come to the fullness of that maturity again at this time unlike Paul the alpha bride did not cause a resurrection but the Omega bride will glory to God glory to God thank you Lord list stand let me finish this quote here for you it'll bring forth them redeemed that's touched that Spirit those Lutheran who stood there with all the light they had in justification those methodists that fell on the floor and they throw water in their face from the spirit striking them through sanctification those Pentecostals that walked up and down the streets and they called them Tong deong what in the world that ever means and jabberers and Goose language and all of that they'll stand in the righteous in the sight of God at that day just as certain as this Bible stands in here oh my Lord imagine the day it'll be when the Lord Jesus is at wor steps behind the curtain and takes off his Priestly garments when the angel you'll see him rise from the throne and he steps off the platform we say and when he comes out he's got on his marriage garments you understand Peter's never seen him yet Paul's never seen him the Saints in the sixth Dimension haven't seen him yet it would be Unbecoming for them to see him with blood on his garments so he changes close imagine when David come in from slaying the Philistines and laid the forkins of those Philistines down before Saul he did not go directly and take Mall imagine he must have went changed clothes took a bath got Philistine sweat off of him Philistine blood off of him when the Lord Jesus steps out and the angel see him for his first time the bridegroom closed of all they've seen out of him they've never seen him look like this can you imagine the smile I know it maybe seem hard for you to comprehend but the Lord Jesus actually laughed when he was here on the earth I imagine one of his greatest laughs will be whenever he steps out and a smile comes upon his face and they're standing there looking at him and say I've never seen him smile like that and they look at one another and say you know what today is she's coming home him changing clothes is a sign you're fixing to amen praise God then those of us that are alive and and remain will change clothes all of a sudden a sweep will come over us and our muscles and our tissues and our bones and all of that will be changed Oh but before that happens our loved ones will start to appear first I told Carol the other day I said I want I want to you know I said you think about it as long as we've been here I've lost the count now but since ever I've been here 35 36 years whatever it is I buried over aund and some people through the years since I've been here I got to think about the other day I'm not sure my house big enough for all them folks to come in at one time I'm going have to build a bigger house cuz I guarantee you one thing when they raise but I imagine there'll be a little girl yes sir about this talk right her long blonde hair hanging down her back if anybody get in her away they say excuse me excuse me excuse me Hallelujah of course after she stops over the hill sees her husband and her children oh I can't wait to see brother Allen mckenny brother Homer Arnold sister clark brother Jean Littleton oh my it'll be one after another and then the prophet said you'll see your loved ones and you know it won't be long you're going to be changed so may I'll be standing there combing my hair you know for years y'all thought this was a teg it's still mine it's still mine it's all still there it didn't turn loose but it did turn gray thank you all for that y'all help do that and I may be standing in front of the mirror brother Rob I brush my teeth and I take the comb out you know I'm I'm combing it back and all of a sudden I run that comb through that gray and it goes and it'll be Browner than it was of that picture that's hanging out there the sister Sylvia wrote the poem about me years and years ago when I first came here and the wrinkles that go out of my face and I'll look and see my loved ones right the prophet said he knows how we are we'll be looking around to see did this one make it did that one make it so we get together with the rest of the group and you come up missing on the earth can you imagine think of it he says going beond the camp 1964 missing people they can't find you no more I wonder who in the world they are they can't find you no more I imagine humans and demons they said where' doy go where' doy go he was standing there brushing his teeth bam he's gone and then they go to communicate them back and forth what in the world happed to ke he was standing there one minute oh Lord my back oh Lord my knee oh Lord and somehow brother Jack maybe getting up on his things oh Jesus I don't know if I can make it another day or not and in a moment brother Jack was changed to a young man and there s sister bent right by and the devil said Lord have mercy what is it the move is on brother the move is on but I want to tell you it's on tonight too the move is on get filled with the Holy Ghost yeah barot children I'm not sure that I could preach a more serious sermon than tonight you may think well you know brother Donnie I'm kind of messed up in my Doctrine and you know maybe this and that I I already needed that tonight but if you can get filled every fiber filled with the Holy Ghost he'll take care of your Doctrine everything you'll have need of is in you then for your journey no doubt I've not buried the last one I'll probably have to bury more I've walked in front of the casket of many and stand there and say the last words over them stand by their bed and watch them take their last breath my life has been filled with so Much Death I hate death oh sometimes I wish I wasn't a preacher that makes sense to you I have to deal with so much sickness and so much turmoil so much sadness so much deaths thank God one day death will die praise God death will die hallelujah how many of you wouldd like to be remember tonight brother Donnie I I just just want to be sure maybe some of you are sure you've got a rest you know beyond the shadow of a doubt you've got the Holy Ghost but maybe you just need to refilling anybody here like that maybe some of you sick you need a healing maybe some of you fighting oppression whatever more you just need the presence of God to come this way look friend I'm not interested in trying to produce to you an AA Allen Revival a jackco Revival oh they had Great Signs wonders and miracles but I'm more concerned about being able by the grace of God to preach to you a gospel that'll produce the life of Jesus Christ then come the signs then come the Wonders then the signs will follow us instead of us following the signs I am not a sign follower I am a person that signs follow yeah that's the way it should be praise the lord lord Jesus as we bow our heads tonight father as we enter into your August courts I pray the presence of God would move across this place Lord we're sitting in a different type building than Peter and them were in Acts 2 different type of setting than they were no doubt at Ephesus the other places where the Holy Ghost come in the book of Acts that's changed we're glad we can say tonight the Holy Ghost is not changed would you come by this way tonight Lord so what are you once you enter into this attribute by which you can divide yourself then my brother Harry not being a preacher but yet has the same holy ghost that I have my nephew Justin my granddaughters both of my daughters my son-in-law WS the people here at the church the the ones that might feel like oh I'm so insignificant but yet if they have the Holy Ghost they've got exact same holy ghost that I've got the same one and their life is a mystery to angels as they watch them and they minister to them oh Lord God we need your ministering presence tonight father sometimes we go through so much in life Lord we don't know what to do would you send an Angel by our way Lord we know you sent one to Peter there in jail and I hope they take it the right way when I say it this way that was Jesus 2,000 years ago well we're not in a physical jail tonight but we still need angels to come to us L ministering spirits that are sent to minister to the air of Salvation wh what a what a what a thing and the word ministering deonia which is the very word that Deacon comes from so when they chose deacons in the book of Acts they were men that were chosen to minister so the deacons are never called to run the church but actually they placed the deacons in the church to be able to minister to the hungry and to be able to take care of the things like that and that's the Greek word that it com comes from Deacon deonia and it means minister to minister to can we grasp it tonight those great Heavenly beings are our deons you send a Heavenly being that's never said one bad word that's never had one thought of doubt them angelss have never had one thought of ever leaving you and you send them to me and to these people and your people around the world Lord God who would think of such that you would send the greater to minister to the Lesser unless of course the Lesser is actually hid and one day the Lesser will enter into such a stage of glorification that the angels of God will Circle the Earth's one day and bow their heads when the Resurrection The Rapture takes place and the prophet tells us those angels will circle the Earth with bowed heads as the redeemed go to singing the songs of your Redemption and mercy because they don't know what we're singing about they Minister about it and they minister to give us strength and courage and hope and all of that but they don't understand it oh Jesus I'm sorry I'm so sorry we've belittled this great thing you've done for us help us tonight Lord may we never look at our Holy Ghost the same way again praise the lord we worship you Lord Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah let's just let's just keep in this presence now I know you got to work tomorrow and you got school and all that but who knows there may not be a tomorrow in no way let's just take a few minutes as if though this might be our last service because it might be for somebody oh praise the Lord can we give him something tonight that an angel cannot can we funnel praise through redeemed lips something that Angels cannot do can we lift hands that were Unholy hands that hell beer cigarettes marijuana fifth of whiskey but now they're classified as holy hands lifting up holy hands praise God I hope you can understand it friends right here in this building tonight are the Angels of God and they are watching you they are watching in bewilderment don't make them wonder why you're not praise him don't make them wonder why that you're not giving him that fruit of your lips oh my but may they see the Fulfillment of Calvary tonight may they see why once again on a Wednesday night that Calvary was a success you know why I know because he saved me because he saved you I a testimony that Calvary worked praise be to God thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus there's a brother right here in our midst tonight came to our church several years ago first service he attended he was taking pills for this pills for that pills for something else one service in the presence of God God delivered him and set him free he's still living right tonight and stands right here in this building as a testimony Calvary was a success each one of you bear your own testimony of what God has brought you through and you stand here tonight and nobody can have your testimony you are unique and you're variegated in the body of God Don't You Love him thank you Lord don't you appreciate him Harry let's just sing a little something together whatever whatever's on your heart let's just Worship the Lord now a little bit before we go I'll try not to hold you too long if you need to go you go on but let's just worship him a little before we go praise God may we now Minister back to our husband brother bam talked about a wife and what a great thing she could be and a man comes in tired from work and he said he's weary and all that and his little wife meets him at the door and she comes in takes him by the hand and sets him down and she goes over and sets in his lap and puts her arms around him he said it just feels like it all goes away I wonder how many times since Sunday the Lord jesus' name has been taken in vain how many people said he don't even live there's no such thing as a God how he's been blasphemed how he's been ridiculed and criticized just in the last couple of days why don't we open the door and say come on in Lord Jesus let's take him by the hand let's take him by the hand and go over and set him down let's sit down in his lap I preached this several years ago in a convention and the Lord helped me to dramatize it like the Song of Solomon and how that she went and got him at the door door and she brought him in and she let him over and set him down and then she sat down on his lap and she took her arm and put around it and let her eyes which at one time could not even look in the face of God

We want to say that we welcome them to this service. Could we give all those folks a good hand tonight if you will. Praise the Lord. We want to look at her our prayer requests tonight. Sister Judy Davis asking for prayer. Abdominal abdominal pain uh very severe. She's just asking that we would remember her as we pray tonight. Brother Kirk Sacker says to please pray for a neighbor of ours who is suffering from head to toe with severe pain. Area physicians cannot find the cause. They sent him to Vanderbilt for further tests last Friday. He is waiting for the results from those tests. So they're asking that we would remember that prayer request tonight. Then we have a testimony from Sister Wanda Bman. Says, \"In April of this year, I had gone to the eye doctor to get new glasses. During the visit, I was told that I had cataracts. The doctor said to come back in one year and discuss surgery to remove them. In August, my vision changed again and the eye doctor referred me to a eye clinic for cataract surgery. This past Wednesday night, I went up for prayer to ask the Lord to remove the cataracts. On Thursday morning, I woke up and the cataracts were gone. All praise and honor to the Lord Jesus for his grace and mercy. Amen. Praise the Lord. You had a good testimony tonight. Amen. Urgent prayer requests for Sister Mary Beth Holloway. The Lord knows all about that need. We just committed unto the Lord. Sister Janet Paynees asking that we would uh pray for two of her grandsons who lost their coworker to suicide and the family uh has really been hit hard and pray for all that's concerned in that. So, we want to remember that prayer request tonight that the Lord would be mindful. Brother Greg Robbins is going to have surgery to remove his eye on Friday. He's been in a lot of pain due to his eye. Please pray that everything goes well. Please remember Sister Shirley in prayer as well. So, we certainly want to pray for those folks tonight. Brother Smith and Sister Diana Ward are not feeling well, unable to be in service. I want to pray for them tonight. Brother Tyler and Sister Caitlyn Gagnan uh sent in a prayer request. She's having some difficulty with her pregnancy and they're just asking without going into a lot of detail, they're just asking that God would be mindful and let everything work out to her good. So, we just commit all that unto the Lord tonight. He's more than able to meet every need among us. Do you believe that tonight with all your heart? And then brother Bisc will be on this coming Sunday. I don't know exact the hour or the time or anything like that, but I I do know that it will be Sunday. So, we certainly want to pray for that family, that church family, that the Lord would just be mindful of all of those folks. And uh, Brother Bisco was a was a great hero of the faith. I believe that with all of my heart. So, we want to just remember all those folks in prayer. Uh, brother Michael says, \"If you want to help with the fall festival, signup sheets are in the library.\" So, remember that. And personal and business changes to the directory will be accepted in the library until Wednesday, October the 15th. So remember that all those announcements tonight. You have an unspoken prayer request tonight you'd like for this group to pray about. Could we stand to our feet? Let's sing that again. The course of that. I'm amazed that you love me. Are you amazed his love for you tonight? Somebody say it's the truth. Anyway, give him one more good hand clap of praise tonight if you love me with all your heart. I'm amazed that you love me.

Appreciate Brother Fred Perry, don't we? &gt;&gt; Good brother. Amen. Dave. Amen. Appreciate you. &gt;&gt; It's so wonderful to be in the house of the Lord. No greater place to be than right here at this time. We could have been anywhere, but the Lord chose us and destinated us to be right here. So let's bow our heads and go to him in prayer. Our gracious heavenly father, we once again we've been given the opportunity to come and sit in the house of God. Oh, it thrills my heart, Lord, to just to be able to say that I could come and sit in the house of God in this day and the hour that we live when such things going on around the world. We can say that we have a king that knelt before a cross in humility, but the father lifted him up in honor. And Lord, we want to do that tonight. We want to lift our hearts to you. Oh, that you could cleanse us, Lord, and help us, Lord, in these times that we have, Lord, our sicknesses and and pains and uh just the way human life is, Lord. But we know we are inheritors of miracles. We've heard one tonight, Lord. And we are inheritors of faith. We are the inheritors of all things only because you went down in humility and raised in honor. And we give you the glory and the power, Lord. We give you our lives, Lord. All things belong to you. And we're not here to fight for anything else. But what we want to fight for, Lord, is our surrender. That we could surrender our hearts and surrender our lives totally for you, Lord. Now, bless the service tonight, Lord. Bless the man of God as he comes. Let wisdom flow from his lips, Lord, that feeds our hearts, Lord, and gives us that uplifting power, Lord, that we need. fill us tonight, Lord. Whatever need we have, Lord, we know that we could come before you and you would answer those things, Lord. We have faith in you, Lord. Now, bless us, Lord, and help us, Lord, as we honor you tonight, Lord, with singing and praise. And let our lips be full of worship and the fruits of our lips be honored before you, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Ushers, if you want to come tonight, receive the evening offering, you give us unto the Lord. Once again, if you're a vist, God bless you. Now, what if you knew that tonight was your last night that you ever get to be in church and you'd ever get this opportunity to worship? &gt;&gt; Would you make it a good one? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, how do you know it ain't? &gt;&gt; Let's sing with everything we got tonight. We want to worship the Lord in spirit and in truth, right? Somebody say, \"Praise the Lord.\" Give him one more good hand clap of praise tonight. Let's sing. After all this life is over. After all this life is over and our burdens have been lifted. And I stand upon the mountain top topped so tall looking over in that city that the Savior is preparing.

You can be seated tonight. Give our singers a nice hand. Sister Adessa, if you want to sing, then the old people will sing. And then brother Caos, you want to sing? [Music] There is a blood that cost a life that paid my way. And death it price. And when it fell down from the cross, my sins were gone. My sins for God. There is a grave that tried to hide this precious blood that gave me life. And in three days he breathed again and rose to stand. in my defense. And so I come to tell you he's alive to tell you that he drives every tear that falls. And so I come to tell you that he saves, to shout and to proclaim that he's coming back for you. [Music] There is a blood. His side is the blind. [Music] It heals the sick, the lonely fight. [Music] It has the power to free the bound has chains a fall [Music] upon the ground. Oh, pour it out to cleanse my soul and let it liquid. Gloryy flow [Music] because he lives to make me whole high. owe my life. [Music] I owe my all. And so I come to tell you he's alive to tell you that he tries every tear that falls. And so I come to tell you that he saves to shout and to provail that he's coming back for you. Oh, what can wash away my sins? Nothing. Oh nothing. And what can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood. Nothing but the blood. So I come to tell you he's alive. to tell you that he tries every tear that falls. And so I come to tell you that he saves to shout and to proclaim that he's coming back for you. [Music] Mary is a blood [Music] that cost a life that paid my way. Death price. [Music] [Applause] Here's another song that uh Sister Betty wrote a long time ago. It seemed like the only people that request us to sing is other old people. I just don't get that. But that's the way it is. As long as you old people want to hear us sing, I guess we'll try to sing for you. Hope this song will bless you. It says, \"I'll soon be gone.\" Amen. [Music] When the darkness of this life is filled with sadness and our hearts are often troubled deep within. I stop and think of how our God looked down upon us. And by faith, he's lifted up where I can see. I'll soon be &gt;&gt; I'll soon be gone. It won't be long till I fly till I home in the sky. There'll be no fears. He'll dry my tears. One of these days with faith so strong, I'll soon be. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I know the light of his presence is now with us. I have seen the amber light so bright and strong. It's brightest ray out shines the light of morning sunshine. I know is God assuring me I'll soon be gone. &gt;&gt; I'll soon I'll soon be gone. It won't be long till I fly to my home in the sky. There will be no fear. He'll dry my tears. One of these days with faith so strong, I'll soon be gone. One of these days with faith so strong I'll soon be gone. [Applause] I love to hear them sing. &gt;&gt; It's awesome to, you know, I grew up in Kentucky, a little bitty single wide trailer church, and I heard all these songs. Sister Geraldine, Sister Jackie, or Sister Betty. And you know, you you you hear the songs, but when you get to meet the person, you really see the life that made that song. It's just it's it's incredible. I love it. I pray this is a blessing. [Music] It's easy to bless you when the valleyies behind me. It's easy to trust you when my world is not unwinding. But this is the darkest midnight that I have ever seen. So I will stand my ground, lift my hands to you and sing. Before the prayer is answered. Before the battle's won. Before this trial is over. Before the healing comes. I will choose to trust you. I will bless you, Lord. I won't wait to praise you after. I will praise you before in the lonely days of silence. [Music] When the waiting gets old, [Music] I've found a flame of worship. [Music] Keeps my heart from growing cold. You've always been so faithful when I can't do my part. Even in my worn out weakness, nothing changes who you are. Before the prayer is answered, before the battle's won, before this trial is over, before the healing comes, I will choose to trust you. I will bless you, Lord. Lord, I won't wait to praise you after. I will praise you before you ever for me. You knew I'd be here on my knees. You're the one who's fighting for me. And you know where this will lead. Before the prayer is answered, before the battle's won, before this trial is over, before the healing comes, I will choose to trust you. I will bless you Lord. I will praise you after. I will praise you before. [Music] No, I won't wait to praise you after. I will praise you before. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of praise we want to have, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Not just wait till the prayer is even answered, but give him praise before it ever gets answered. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read tonight Genesis 24 verse 58. Trust everybody's doing well. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Fighting the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Winning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not near as many of you winning. Are you winning? &gt;&gt; All right. Praise the Lord. That's what we want to hear. Let's read together. And they called Rebecca and said unto her, \"Will thou go with this man?\" And she said, \"I will go.\" And they sent away Rebecca, their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. Won't you notice the order? Who came first? [Music] &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Rebecca. Ah. And they sent away Rebecca, their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. So you see the going away is not brother Brandham going to have a private resurrection and then brother Brandham's going to raise all the dead and we're going to have a tent meeting &gt;&gt; and people's going to get the Holy Ghost and &gt;&gt; that's contrary to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is the final voice of the final age? &gt;&gt; The bride is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; That's what he said. And they blessed Rebecca and said unto her, \"Thou art our sister. Be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.\" And Rebecca arose and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebecca, and went his way. I want to speak to you tonight on the bride's dowy. How many like to be remembered as we go before the Lord? Aren't you glad that our God, if there would be millions of people praying at this very instant, some need healing, some need financial blessing, some need a job, some need this, this, this. He could hear all of them at one time. and be sure and get your name on your package and then your neighbor wouldn't have to bring you a package because they delivered your package at their door and you got their package. But our God is so mighty and so wonderful that he can hear all of that at once and send each answer right directly on time to the right individual. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father, we so so love you tonight. We're just so thankful for everything that you mean to us, Lord. Oh God, as we gather here, Lord, it's not to magnify man, magnify a system, magnify some brotherhood, but we are here to worship and magnify you, Father. And we realize the more that we learn to do that, the more you will pull us into yourself. I find it to be phenomenal that the more we give to you, the more of yourself you give to us. I'm so grateful for that. It's no wonder to me that Satan has so many of the preachers out in religious worlds today just focusing constantly on the people, the people, the people, the people, the people. Because the devil knows if they ever magnify you and ever see who you are, what a thing it does. So I pray we would not be guilty of that. Lord, open our eyes tonight. That we can see you and the magnitude of your love by the gifts and the great treasures that you bestow upon your people. You saw all the hands are uplifted. We're just asking you that you'd be mindful of us tonight, Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. The word sill you him. Sill you him. That's a Hebrew word for dowry. For us as westerners, the dowy doesn't really mean much of anything. But let me read it to you so you'll understand it. The dowy was given to the bride by her father to equip her for her new life. It's also part of her inheritance. Let me read it to you again. Given to the bride by her father to equip her for her new life, part of her inheritance. Now the dowy, the Bible here in Genesis of course doesn't mention it, but Rebecca actually would have been given a dowy not from Abraham, not from Isaac, but from her paternal and maternal parents, of course. And it would have included part of the fortune as far as what they had. It may have included things old and things new. Things that were more of a family inheritance, things that would have been a treasure to them and them only. Other people would look at and say, \"I wouldn't have that piece of junk. I don't know what that even is.\" But to that family, it would have been something very special. Now, she's going to leave with this man and depart. Never come back. Actually, never see them again. And yet they want to give her something from her parents that will be able to identify her in that lineage even though she will be so very far away. So the dowy was very very important. Now it's not just something in the past for some some marriages and some cultures and so on. They still do the same thing today. So they would give that then to the daughter because the daughter did not receive a divided portion of the inheritance when it come to land, cattle, sheep, oxen and so on. It was divided among the sons. And you remember one of the men in the Old Testament whenever Moses was there that they had to have a special hearing because the man had no sons. And then they went to God and God said, \"Well, because there is no sons, let the daughters have a part of it.\" But that was not the norm. The norm was that the sons would get it and the eldest son would get a double portion. So if you had seven sons, the inheritance was divided by eight, which meant the eldest son got two parts. But here now the dowy was something totally for the female only. No bridegroom got a dowy. That was not his. It was for the bride only. You know, as I begin to look at this, I've realized that the bride of Christ also has a dowy, something given to her from who? Not from her husband, but from her father. Now, we're in a very strange relationship as far as when it comes to our relation to deity. Now, let me explain it to you this way. Actually, our father had a son. Now that son was only a human embodiment or a human tabernacle by which the father could get into and create a blood and shed that blood so that he could redeem his people. Now that father is that great being of course that is light and his spirit and he was not a man but he gave to the world. He gave also to us of course his only begotten son. Now remember only begotten at that time. So he was the only begotten son at that time. And what was that? It was a human temple by which the father could dwell in in order to redeem and pay the price to bring us back. So here he plays two parts. So spirit God is our father and then the father himself gives birth to a son when before the foundation of the world but at that time he wasn't even a human he was the logos. So then he condescends from being the logos to becoming a human being. Now but we still have this wonderful relationship with spirit God which is our father. Now remember the body the human body of the Lord Jesus is not your father. &gt;&gt; The human body of the Lord Jesus is not your father. As a matter of fact he wasn't his own father. The human body was a body of time that God created and it was his own body and he called it sunship. Now watch in though believers then are given gifts by the father to equip them for their new life and for their journey as they're heading to be able to meet their bridegroom. Read with me in Matthew 7 11. If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your father, now notice the position from which these gifts are coming from? They say, \"What difference does it make?\" Oh, it makes all the difference in the world. You see, or if you were here and you were a gentile and you would have called out, \"Son of David, son of David, have mercy on me.\" You know what? you would have got absolutely nothing &gt;&gt; because you were claiming the wrong dispensational title. &gt;&gt; So you could only get from God and remember the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God. So that's why they can scream the name of Jesus in the day we're living in and hardly get nothing out of it. But it will be revealed in what he said the thunders. So when the voice of God makes his message known in every day, it will be the word interpreted for the age that the elect of God live in, they will be caught by that word. The others will pass right on by, join church, join religion, become religious, all that sort of thing, and miss it a million miles. But we don't want to do that, do we? &gt;&gt; Now notice then where the source of these great gifts come from. How much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? How many like to know tonight what your dowy a little bit of it includes? Well, if it's yours, wouldn't you want to know your sisters whenever you got married? Now, if your father would have said, \"Now, honey, whenever you get married, daddy's got something for you.\" I'll tell you what, daddy is going to give you a a surprise. It's going to be a gift. And your daddy was a wealthy man and you know, a man that was equipped to do it. And you'd be anxious, of course, thinking, \"Oh my, what's daddy going to give me? Is he going to give us a house? Is he going to give us $1,000, $10,000? What's dad going to give you?\" Well, let me just share with you tonight what our heavenly father has already given to us. It ain't going to be $1,000. It ain't going to be $10,000. As a matter of fact, it will be riches that you can't even think about without God helping you to do it. There will be so much of it that God will give to us just in this life. If this life contains so many beneficial blessings and great things of what he wants us to do, I cannot imagine what the world that is to come is going to be like. Now, let's look at and we'll start from the basic foundation of where we come to him. And let's look at being forgiven. Oh, aren't you glad you're forgiven tonight? Romans 4:7 saying, \"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered, whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered.\" Now, think of that old life that you used to live. Now, the downside is that us of human beings that we can still remember the wrongs that we've done. We can remember how bad they were, how terrible they were, how awful we felt when we done them. But there's one great thing I know. Our God remembers none of them against us. Thank God. Ephesians 4:32. And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ sake hath forgiven you. Now, this is why we are forgiven. It's not because we deserve it. It's not because we held our hands a certain way or we said certain words when we pray. God forgave you for Christ's sake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the church said &gt;&gt; as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. Colossians 2:13. And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your hearts, has he quickened together not apart from him, but with him? Has he quickened together with him? You mean to tell me that I was already quickened before I was ever even born? You was already identified in the quickening power of God before you ever draw one breast in your human body. How can that be? What if Adam lost my inheritance before I was born? The second Adam regained my inheritance before I was born. Come on, somebody. Now, you realize it's the work of God and the grace of God that's done it. And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all, oh, praise God, all trespasses. Colossians 2:14, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us. Now, I want you to listen to this. I was so curious about these words. So, I've done a little research and got to looking at it and I found the meanings of this verse. I thought it's so awesome. I wanted to share it with you. The burdens, some requirements of the law have been abolished. And of course, it's superseded by the death of our Lord Jesus. But what it leads up to is the word handwriting signifies an acknowledgment signed by us that we owe a certain amount. Now the handwriting that was against us, we actually had to acknowledge it ourself. So here was all this debt. Here was all this that we've done and we had to acknowledge it and we had to take our own handwriting as it were and acknowledge I am guilty of this and this and this and this and this and God in that sense made us acknowledge it. You say, \"When, Brother Donnie, when did that happen?\" When you come to an altar and you begin to acknowledge, \"Lord God, I'm a low down rotten sinner. I've drunk. I've lied. I've stole. I've cheated. I've done this. Don't you understand what you was doing?\" Your own personal handwriting will say, \"I'm a sinner. I'm no good. I'm no count. If God don't help me, there ain't no hope for me.\" And God said, \"All right, now that you've signed it and you admit the bill is too large for you, this is what I am going to do for you in exchange.\" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to the cross. So he took all that we did by our personal acknowledgment and he took it from us and he took that oh glory to God that agreement that we said yep I deserve it I ain't no good I ain't worth even living oh my and he said I'll tell you what I'm going to do now I'm going to take that and I'm going to nail it to the cross what a peculiar way to say that remember it was the Lord for Jesus who was nailed to the cross and yet your sins being identified as being lost and wretched and he took that and nailed it to the cross. Why? Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5, he who knew no sin became sin that we might become the very righteousness of God in him. Listen little bride, this is part of your gallery. This is something that even after you get saved, it gives you hope because guess what? You're still going to fall flat on your face. You're still going to make mistakes. You're still going to mess up. &gt;&gt; But can't that same God who buried, oh, hallelujah, that died and buried and rose again? Cannot that same God that took that handwriting that was against you forgive you now to your sons and daughters of God? Oh, praise be to God. So, here is this massive sum on the bill that I owed all of this debt. My body, my soul, my temperament, my character, everything that I was was absolutely obligated to that. So, it brought me under the state of condemnation. The only thing he wanted me to do was acknowledge it. Just acknowledge it that you're lost, that you're wretched, that you cannot do it without me. And I will take it for you. I become that for you. But it will not do you any good until you acknowledge that you need a savior. Oh, no matter how great he is, how wonderful he is, he can only save you if you'll let him. He can only heal you tonight if you'll let him. He can only encourage you tonight. I wish somebody would preach with me. He can only encourage you. He can only lift you up. He can only be your peace, your joy, your satisfaction if you'll receive it from him. But if you won't let him, he can't do it. All of heaven, hallelujah, is at your disposal there. If you'll call upon his name and say, \"Lord, I am a member of your bride. It's part of my dowy.\" A dowry is not for you in the millennium. It's not for you at the marriage supper of the lamb. It's given to you for your journey from here to there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Having spoiled principalities and powers. Oh, I love this. He made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it. Triumphing over them in it. Right in the middle of it. He triumphed over hell. 1 John 2:12, I wrote unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. Do you understand that? It brings glory to his name for every sinner that will accept him as their savior. Praise the Lord. Now, remember, of course, friends, that many folks will be saved that will not be bribed. Oh, of course there will. There'll be all kinds of people that'll be saved because they're trusting Jesus as their savior. I don't want him just to be my savior. I want him to be my Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people, oh yes, oh Lord, please save me. Save me from hell. But Lord, don't you tell me what I can live now. Don't you tell me what I can wear and I can't wear and I can't go here and I can't go there and now. Lord, don't tell me that. Well, you say they want him as savior, but they don't want him as Lord, but the bride wants him as Lord. I said the bride wants him as her Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice another gift now that the father wanted to impart to his children was the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh my, how we appreciate the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now, I'm not talking about being baptized in your spirit, but I'm talking about your soul becoming illuminated by the very breath of God. The same breath of God that breathed into Adam was the very same breath of God that told the disciples and St. John receive ye the Holy Ghost and he breathed on them and a few days later the breast come into the upper room. &gt;&gt; So it was a delayed reaction but they caught up with it. Now the same Lord Jesus notice what he says in St. John 14:16. I will pray the father. I here's our Isaac now. I will pray to the father. Abraham in the type. I will pray to the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever. Now remember the disciples were hearing some of these things for their first time. And they were hearing talking about leaving and going away. I'm not sure they didn't want him to go away. But Jesus tells them here in St. John 14, it is expedient for you that I go away because if I don't go away, the comforter cannot come. What is it another person of the Godhead? No, it's actually the same person of the Godhead but in a different manifestation. One that the church could receive. We could not receive the corporal body of Jesus in our body. &gt;&gt; Well, if I got the corporal body of Jesus in my body, then none the rest you ain't got the Holy Ghost. or if you got it, I ain't got the Holy Ghost. But what's he going to do? Change himself. Now God is a spirit and God gave birth to a spirit son, which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now notice Jesus saying that I will pray the father and the father will give you a comforter. Notice even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive. So a person that comes up to receive salvation, they cannot receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; According to Jesus, &gt;&gt; I guess he knew more about it than preachers. What do you think? &gt;&gt; The world cannot receive the Holy Ghost, but the world can receive salvation. &gt;&gt; But not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is for a vessel that has come through a process. A sinner comes straight from the world. They come to the Lord Jesus, receive him as their savior. The process starts and many of them never go any further than being saved. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. So, the Holy Ghost is not just for saved people. It's for people who are saved and sanctified and they're cleansed and they're ready to receive a filling on the inside. So God don't bring a sinner up to the altar and that sinner smoking, drinking, lying, committing adultery, got all them demons inside their body and God filled that person with the Holy Ghost. Are you kidding me? God sharing that soul with demons. &gt;&gt; No way. So that person has to go through a purging, a cleansing, a sanctification process to receive the Holy Ghost. And who's Jesus speaking this to? to men who are finalizing their stage of sanctification, even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him ought not and knowice. Now notice so you mean you can't receive him if you don't know who he is. &gt;&gt; So what if you're taught he's a third person? &gt;&gt; Well, that ain't who he is. And if you don't see him as he is, &gt;&gt; oh, brother Tony, what about you? What about you? I turned Pentecost. Did you have the Holy Ghost? Oh, yeah. I had a baptism, &gt;&gt; but I didn't have the person. &gt;&gt; I shouted. I run. I jumped. I spoke in tongues. I preached. I prayed for sick and watch them get well. All kinds of things. And still preach false doctrine. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz I was ignorant to it. I wasn't intentionally doing it. I was blind. Well, if I'd had the Holy Ghost in my soul according to Jesus, wouldn't that spirit of truth led me to the truth? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but ye know him. For he dwelleth with you and shall be in you. &gt;&gt; Who's he talking about? The Lord Jesus himself, not his body, the pillar of fire coming back to break itself up. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you one thing, it's quite awesome. If you look in question answers 64, and you'll find the prophet of God saying, \"The same pillar of fire is on the earth today anointing sons of God to bring the word to the bride.\" It's absolutely phenomenal quote. Notice in St. John 14:18, I will not leave you comfortless. I &gt;&gt; will come to you. &gt;&gt; So you mean it's Jesus? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost in the upper room was Jesus. &gt;&gt; Well, wait a minute. But the Bible said that they saw tongues of fire. They didn't see the corporal body. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What was it? spirit son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Notice little bride. Oh, let's open our little diary package tonight and see what's on the inside. What do you say? Here's another little thing that God wanted to give to to his daughter, the bride, who's going to be married to his son, the word. You see, the whole family is a word family. And God can designate what portion of the word that he wants the son to fulfill. He designates what portion of the word that he wants the bride to fulfill. And then he also designates the portion of the word that he himself will fulfill as father god. As father god's spirit form he could not die for us because the spirit cannot die. As father god he had no blood. So what did he do? He took that portion of the word and created a son and lived inside that son, that human body. Hallelujah. In order to pay the price, oh that we could be set free. &gt;&gt; Notice St. John again 14:27. Peace I leave with you. My peace I give unto you. How many of you all tonight will be honest and say you need more peace in your life? &gt;&gt; I understand we're living in a troubled world, are we not? &gt;&gt; We're living in a world when people will not even disagree politically or on, you know, different values of this and that and the other without trying to kill you. I'm sure you heard again today there was another uh sniper and they uh had shot at some ICE agents and it's it's the time that we're living at. Well, brother Darn, you think about that? Of course I do. My own life's been threatened many times. Do I think about it? Sure I think about it. But you know what I told Carol the other day? We can't live under the spirit of fear and thinking all, you know, oh my goodness, I can't get out. I can't go here. I can't go there. I will not live that way. God does not want me to live that way. How can I not live that way? Peace. &gt;&gt; Peace. I believe he brought me on the earth to serve his purpose. There ain't enough devils in hell. There ain't enough 30 odd sixes, 270s, whether they're Remington or whether be Magnum. There ain't enough cannons. There ain't enough whatever more to take me out of here until God is done with me. Come on, somebody. If I didn't believe that, I'd be mighty discouraged tonight. The way I look at it, if I'm flying on a 747 or whatever and that thing crashes, if it ain't the will of God for me to go, I'll be the only survivor out in the middle of the Himalayan mountains or wherever it is. And they're thinking, \"How in the world did that man live? I'll tell you how he lived because God wasn't done with him yet.\" And you and I need to get away from the fear that the devil controls our life and the devil numbers our days. No, he don't. He didn't bring me on the earth. He can't take me off the earth until God's done. Hallelujah. I am God almighty son and you are his child, his son or daughter. And the devil has to back off because God is the one who's in control of our lives. &gt;&gt; Y'all forgive me tonight. I'm feeling a little Church of Christy. Amen. &gt;&gt; My peace I give unto you. Not as the world giveth give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled. Neither let it be afraid. So you mean you and I have some control over our heart being troubled &gt;&gt; and being afraid. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Romans 1:7. To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints, grace to you and peace from both Abraham and Isaac, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, to all that be in Rome. I I met a brother, let me share this with you. I met a brother in Switzerland and he come up to me. He couldn't speak English very well, but he had a younger guy there. He spoke English really well and he said, \"This is my this is my pastor and he he wants to invite you to Rome.\" So, I got a church in Rome. So, this this pastor, big tall guy, he told him, he said, \"Tell him to come and preach where Paul preached Rome.\" Well, I may never go to Rome to preach, but this scripture right here, even though I'm not a Roman, it's got my name wrote all over it. &gt;&gt; What about us? Some of you Indiana people, Tennessee people, Arkansas people, is this scripture just good for the Roman brothers and sisters, or is it good for us as a people of God? to all that be in Rome. Notice how he directs to beloved. Beloved of God, not just loved, not just love. Beloved is a higher degree of love, special one who is worthy of grace. Chew on that a while. Oh my. Beloved of God, called to be saints. You're not just called to be saved. You're not just called to come up through the tribulation period. You're called to be saints of the most high God. &gt;&gt; Grace to you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Romans chapter 5 verse one. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace, amen, with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Not peace from God now in this application, but peace with God. Why would he say it that way? Cuz we were born at war with God. &gt;&gt; We were born at war. Oh my. Aren't you glad you ain't at war with God no more? Oh my. I'd rather be at war with this world. I'd rather be at war with the devil. I'd rather be at war with demons every day of my life than to be at war with God. At one time, I was at war with God. All of you were too. You might as well say, \"Amen.\" But how in the world did I ever make peace? It was not me that made peace. It was my Isaac. It was my Isaac that paid the price. And he said, \"You don't have to no longer be at war with my father. I will make and tear down the middle wall of petition. And I will bring you both together, Father God and man. &gt;&gt; And I will be your shalom.\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Romans 15:13. Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing. Wow. Fill you with all joy and peace. I'm a believer. I'm a believer. Well, do you have joy and peace and you're believing? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm the happiest person in the world. Well, let your face know about it. Rest of us, too. Okay. Oh, I'm so glad I'm saved. Thank God. I hope I die today. I'm so sick of this life. I'm so sick of it. And you got all joy and peace. You sorry dog. You ain't telling the truth. The devil's robbed you. Your diary is sat there. I mean, you got gold and riches and treasures and saffron and you've got needles of purple and blue and all kinds of things piling out of your diary chest. And you're sitting there all puffed up like a bullfog eating buckshot. And you're sitting there sad and down and depressed and weary. It's time that we rise up pride and say, \"I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I'm sick of the devil stealing my joy. I'm sick of the devil stealing my children. I'm sick of the devil interrupting our home. Oh, hallelujah. I am grateful tonight that we have peace with God. &gt;&gt; Now, the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing. Brother Mike, I just seen you. That's the sneakiness preacher right there I've ever seen in my life. that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost. Oh, Philippians 4:7. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. The peace of God which passeth all understanding. Notice what's going to keep your hearts and your mind. The peace of God, brother Malca. That's your ability to quote scripture. Well, I I pay my tithes and and I go to church and and I pray for brother Donnie once every every now and then whenever I think about it and and I do kind deeds and I do this and no Lord, I ain't got no peace. That's not what that's not what does it. It's the power of God. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Colossians 3:15. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts. Look at the meaning of this word &gt;&gt; to be an umpire. to decide, determine, direct, &gt;&gt; control. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You mean peace? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Peace. The peace of God can be like an umpire. All right. So, the picture gets ready. &gt;&gt; He's doing them finger and all that whatever they do back there. Boy, he ready on. He whining her up. He's getting ready on. Boy, he sold that thing today. He boy said bow and the devil I I mean the pitcher said why he he struck out I that old boy it ain't in him to to hit a home run. Oh but it is. You see it's in us to hit a home run. Every member of the bride has a built-in mechanism to have a home run. Why? We come from home and we're going back and we're running on the way back. So we are doing a home run. We're not squatting. We're not sitting. We're not going to be pushed in a wheelchair. And they ain't going to roll us in on a stretcher somewhere. But the bride's doing a home run. So get out of our way, devil. And the peace of God is going to be the umpire in my heart. I may feel down, but the umpire says it's joy unspeakable and full of glory, but I don't feel it. You sure it wasn't a strike? I mean, I'm going to sit down if you want me to. I think I struck out. I think I I think I struck out. He said, \"You knucklehead you didn't ain't had but one throw at you. I don't know where you figured you struck out.\" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So the devil winds up another one. &gt;&gt; Boy, here comes that ball at 100, whatever it is. And you just know for get I'm struck out. I'm struck out now. And you're saying, \"Wow, you mean I'm still saved? Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I wish we could let the umpire rule in our hearts.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you get up in the morning and you check your phone, you go look at all the texts and all the emails and, you know, all this and that and other all filled with all that negative stuff. Sometimes I wish uh some of us didn't even have a smartphone cuz it sure don't make us too much smarter, does it? Before we ever leave the house, we're so down and wore out and depressed and so much going on in this crazy world that we're living in and we let our phone control our hearts instead of the peace of God. You let your phone be your umpire. You let Fox News be your umpire. You let CNN be your umpire. I'll tell you one thing, you're letting the devil rob you, friends. Let the peace of God be your umpire. And listen to what he's saying. If he says walk, walk. [Applause] Well, the umpire is truthful. And the truth of it is tonight, he's telling us, some of us, that we're close to striking out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you done struck twice. You better listen to what the umpire is saying. He said, \"Boy, you better let me have control of your life. You better let me have control of your emotions. You better let me have control of your life. And let me be the umpire. I'll make the calls for you. And it's not dry calls. It's calls with power. &gt;&gt; If he says you're happy, well, I guess you ought to act like it. &gt;&gt; Let the peace of God rule &gt;&gt; in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body. And be ye &gt;&gt; sad and depressed. &gt;&gt; Thank God. What? &gt;&gt; Thankful. &gt;&gt; Thankful. Ain't that awesome? Now, if that wasn't enough, well, let me look over there. What is that? Oh my goodness. Let me reach down in there and pull out of that dowy box. Oh my goodness. Can that be true? Yeah. This little this little item in your diary is called we are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:10, for we are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; How many of y'all believe God makes junk? &gt;&gt; Does God specialize in trash? Does God specialize in good for nothings? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; All of us are known by our works. &gt;&gt; A sister that can bake and cook and you know, no matter what, if it's a country cook or whatever it is, she know that. Oh yeah, we're having a dinner. Be sure now and get sister so and so's beans. I'm telling you what, them beans are to die for. If Sister Angel Smith makes that chocolate cake, you stand right there in line. You get your cake. Somebody's going to bring that delish stuff and this and that and the other. Why? You're identified. If Sister Barbara brings some of them black cookies, oh man, alive. Them no bakes. I mean, get up there and get it. Boy, whenever we go to heaven, our fall festival here in a little bit. And some of y'all get in line. Boy, I'm going here. I'm going there. Oh yeah, brother so and so does that. They make them deer nuggets and they cut that up and they wrap that in that bacon. I'll tell you what, I'm slobbering right now thinking about it. Why? Because the worst. Now, what if it tasted like tar? What if it tasted like tarpentine with a little bit of sulfur and a little bit of apples, you know, asphalt on the side and you dip it over an oil? You know, you'd say, \"Don't never go to that booth. That stuff will make you sicker than a dog.\" You're identified by your works. You're identified by what you put out. Almighty God's reputation. If he does not produce a bride that is like himself, &gt;&gt; he is an absolute liar and failure. But I ain't worried about that happening. Are you? My God don't make no junk. He don't make no trash. He don't make hallelujah something that he cannot trust. My God will complete his work. [Applause] You see that stone column right there? That's my workmanship. You see this one? That's brother Dave Swanson's workmanship. Now, you study the way they're laid and you'll see I've got a style and he has a style. The sign out on the road, my style. Simon in the in the the fireplace over there, mine and his together. So you see, God is identified by his workmanship. So on the day of Pentecost, the great contractor come down himself and he said, \"Boy, I'm tell you one thing. Now these old boys, they're they're something. These boys are something, but just wait till I get done with them. Just wait till I get work done working on Peter. He is going to make me a fire brand like the devil ain't never heard nothing about it before. You wait till John gets the Holy Ghost. Him and James. I mean, they're the sons of thunder. I named them that. But boy, wait till they get the Holy Ghost. It'll turn John from a son of thunder into love itself. It'll totally transform John. It'll change Thaddius. It'll even change Mary. It'll change them all. Why? Because they are going to Lord have mercy. They're going to be my workmanship. And when I get done with them, even the angels of God will circle the earth with their heads bowed as they look at my work. [Music] So the astronomers say that there's over one setillion stars in the visible universe. So that's a one with 21 zeros. That's quite impressive, isn't it? &gt;&gt; I mean, I know y'all know the word septanian all the time. That's how much money you've got, right? &gt;&gt; If you're playing Monopoly, maybe. But that was not the height of his creation. The height was when he said, \"Let us make man in our image.\" And the prophet tells us that God wanted a world filled with sons and daughters. Now, he knew when he made this little blue dot and put it out in this Milky Way, and he knew that it would be one of the smallest. Had it been just a bit closer to the sun, it been too hot for life to survive. &gt;&gt; Had it been just a little farther away, it would have been too cold. But he placed it right in what they call the habitable zone. Habitable zone. So, they're spending all kinds of money trying to find another planet like this one. I I'll go ahead and tell them. I mean, NASA won't listen to me anyway, you know, but they're not going to find one. &gt;&gt; The Earth is the only planet whose name is in the book of life, &gt;&gt; which is the Bible. Jupiter, Neptune, Mars, Saturn, none of them are there. Why don't God throw this earth away and make another one? He cannot. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because this earth is his attribute. &gt;&gt; And remember, he come on the earth and took his own body out of the 16 elements &gt;&gt; of this earth. And the Lord God never had a permanent flesh body until Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now that body sits at the right hand of the spirit thrown universe there to make intercession for us. For we are his workmanship created. I was at the stone yard Monday getting some stone for a little bit of landscaping I've been doing over here at the church. And the guy there that he knows me and I bought quite a bit from him and he said, ' Do you know this man? I said, 'N no. And I I was over there picking up rocks one at a time. So this guy, they picked up a pallet and scooted it through on his truck and loaded it on the truck. Well, the guy that owned that truck, he come over to me and he said, \"I was going to tell you they do load them up. I said, \"Yeah, sir.\" And I was going to ask you, \"Was you holding your breath the whole time that's loading them up in the back of that brand new Ford truck of yours?\" And then the guy suddenly has said, \"Oh, he comes here all the time talking about me.\" He said, \"He's one picky fell. He goes out there in that yard and he picks them up one at a time and looks at him.\" Well, you see, I have something in my mind &gt;&gt; that I want it to look like. So, I finished most of it for the most part today. So, I was up here taking pictures of it and sending it to Carol. So, I get my phone down like this. I get as people pass by and said, \"That's the preacher.\" You imagine how the people are that go to church there. He's out there taking pictures of dirt. So this one had little green specks and that one had little silver and this one had this and that one had that. And I sent Carol a little caption down at the bottom of it. Handpicked rocks. And she answered back, \"That's the best kind.\" So you see that is a mirror of my work. That's my workmanship. Each of you are known by your word. Then how would we ever believe that God would have to settle for a faulty, flawed church that barely makes it to church once every now and then, and they can't quit overcoming sin and lying and all kinds of filthy habits. And the great creator has to settle for that. Well, I guess I just have to settle for that. &gt;&gt; No, sir. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works. We are his making. And these virtues that we've been talking about for several several weeks, that's the creation unfolding in our lives. You see, we are his making. We are created by him and for him. Now, it's more than just the general sense of rocks and trees and cattle and all that sort of thing. But this is a new creation. Now, look at the word created. I about had a spell when I looked at this. We're created in Christ Jesus. And it means to make habitable. habitable to people, a place, a region, an island. Hence to found a city, a colony, a state, to form, shape, to completely change or transform. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for what? What? &gt;&gt; Good works. You see, this is why a person that really has the Holy Ghost, it's it's just as easy for them to do good works as it is an an evil person to do bad works. &gt;&gt; That's just their nature. Because their old nature has been annihilated and the workmanship of the almighty God has been recreated in their soul. You're quite something. You know that if you are born again, you are quite something. &gt;&gt; For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Oh my. God ordained you and I to live a holy life. And the church said God ordained us to live a life of holiness &gt;&gt; and purity and separation. &gt;&gt; Now the word here that that Paul used to means to prepare beforehand is to predestinate or to appoint before it. It includes the idea of a previous determination or an arrangement beforehand for securing a certain result. &gt;&gt; Ah, so if you want a certain result and you're dealing with old dirt bags, you better predetermine. &gt;&gt; There ain't no telling what you'll come out if you don't. So God said, \"Now this is going to be the greatness and the height of my creation. I will put my sons and daughters in mortal flesh. I will put them in that oil. I I I will put them in that and I will predestinate them. It is in my being. It is in my being to give me a purpose, a reason to be.\" I'll let you think on that for a minute. The previous preparation of the divine intention. You see, and Paul said that we should walk in them. Watch again. Ephesians chapter 2:1. Wherefore remember that ye being in time past, Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision, that at that time ye were without Christ. Oh my, remember that. I don't ever want to go back to that again. &gt;&gt; Being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel. Oh my. and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to preach to you sometime on these two words, but now that's what I was, but now. But now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were a far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, &gt;&gt; who has made both one Jew and Gentile, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us. He is our peace. So the Lord Jesus died for both Jew and Gentile to make in them one new man. The new man, the new creation is what? The church. They could never do it under the Abrahamic covenant of the flesh. They could never do it under the covenant with Isaac, the covenant of Jacob. So it had to be a new covenant. A star would arise out of Jacob. A star would arise out of Jacob. not a man, not that would come down through Isaac's lineage, but a star from heaven would arise out of Jacob and he would have the scepter cuz the scepter would come and it would be whatever he would bring forth. Oh, glory to God. And he would come forth from between the feet. And what would he do? He would make in one new man. One new man called what? Jew, Gentile, the church. Oh Jesus became our shalom who has made both one form one church out of two different types of people Jews and Gentiles by abolishing the law of the covenant that was given by Moses which is only temporary only to last for a while. Notice in verse 15, chapter 2, having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new man. So here he comes to take within himself the Jewish law, the Jews take within himself and merge the Gentiles in himself. And then once they come in him, the product out of that the two become one &gt;&gt; called what? The church. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. For to make it himself of twain one new man, so making peace, that he might reconcile both unto God in the one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby, and came and preached peace to you who were a far off, and to them that were nigh, Jew and Gentile. And through him we both have access. Here you go, little bride. Here are some more of your little dowy. Access the act of bringing to approach to God. That relationship with God whereby we are acceptable to him and have assurance that he is favorably disposed towards him, &gt;&gt; permitted to approach God through his name. Aren't you glad tonight? So here the Greek word here relates the word that Paul chose to use was someone seeking an audience of a great personage and an officer would go between the person seeking the audience and the one they're seeking the audience from. It was a person that was greatly trusted and one that had authority. And this deputy, this magistrate, this person mediator in our state would go between them and say, \"Sir, he wants to see you. He wants to see you.\" And I I want to sue you and say that I I think that you should see him. I think you should take time with him or with her and to help him that I I think that that they are worthy of it. They are worthy of it. Oh, children, they are worthy of it. They are worthy of it. You imagine the book of Revelation, the worthy one saying to the church, \"For ye will walk with me in white, for ye are worthy.\" &gt;&gt; So here we come to the approach, not to a stern, angry God. And you've heard me tell it before when I was a trinitarian and I didn't know how to pray. And I'd pray to the father and I'd pray to the son. I'd pray to the holy ghost. And I go back, forget which one I'd prayed to. &gt;&gt; You think, \"Well, that's pretty far out.\" Well, brother Brandham said he used to think that God hated him and Jesus loved him. &gt;&gt; He said till he found out that's the same person. &gt;&gt; So the wrath of God was swallowed up in the heart of the Lord Jesus. And he settled my account. My signature was on there. I said I was guilty. I agreed. I lied. I agreed. I'd done wrong. I agreed. I validated it with my own signature. He said, \"Sign it, Donnie, and let me have it.\" &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Ephesians 2:19. Now, therefore, ye are no more strangers, alien from a person or a thing, without the knowledge of, without a share in, oh no. Oh my. Unheard of. One who receives and entertains, another hospitably, and who stays or lodges. You're no longer strangers and foreigners. One who lives in a place without the right of citizenship. That was me. Metaphorically without citizenship in God's kingdom. one who lives on earth as a stranger, a souljourer on earth of Christians whose fatherland is in heaven. You were strangers and foreigners, but now fellow citizens possessing the same citizenship with others. A fellow citizen of Gentiles is received into the communion of the saints of the people consecrated to God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Notice this. fellow citizens with the saints and the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone, and whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord. Fitly framed together was a carpenter term. It meant to join together as a carpenter would join together the framework of a building. Oh, praise God. So, the materials are exactly cut by whom? God himself. So, we have some of the church that'll be like this. We'll have some preachers that'll preach this way, some that are preached that way, some that are preached the other way. Thank God for it. He knows exactly what to make. Is that right? So he does the same in your life as a lay person and God will take that and bring it all together. And what Paul identified in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth. Wow. What a strange building. This building is a growing building. growing high in faith and virtue and knowledge. &gt;&gt; Whoa. As far as number wise and all that close we get to the end, we ain't going to grow so much in number. I figure we're going to get smaller and smaller. &gt;&gt; There'll be more and more that'll turn away. Not only that, we're getting more on the other side than we got left here. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; But the building is growing. growing in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord. The growth of the church is not measured by how many new people you get. &gt;&gt; I mean, go out and knock on people's doors and try to bring them to the message. We try to hand out, you know, doctrinal things and this and that. No, this this growth here, it's not so much the natural. In whom also ye are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit. In the book of Genesis, God walked with his people. But in Exodus, he decided to dwell with his people. Exodus 25:8 in the tabernacle also chapter 40:34 until Israel's sin caused the glory of God to leave the tabernacle. But then once again God appears on the earth in the body of Jesus, his own personal human temple, that the spirit of God could dwell in that structure. Let's read and I'll close your just momentarily. Ephesians 3:1, \"For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to youward, how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote a four and few words, whereby that when you reach you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men. Now, no doubt there were Christians in that day that was not concerned about the mystery of Christ. They just wanted to be saved, &gt;&gt; saved from hell, go to church, you know, do a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Now, we know that had to be there because that church had already started riding. The white horse rider had already started riding and made a twin to the real identified church. So, they just thought, \"All you got to do is believe. You just believe and you accept it and that's it. But Paul said, \"Oh, no, no, no. There's much, much more. There's many mysteries here that if you're part of that elect, you'll enter into that great place with God, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men. It is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit, that the Gentiles should be fellows of the same body.\" Can you imagine now some of them Jews sitting there? &gt;&gt; Now Paul wrote this to the church in Ephesus which is mainly Gentiles. &gt;&gt; You imagine some of them Jews struggling but they ain't them. They ain't fit to sit with us. Wow. They men ain't even circumcised. Somebody told me they seen them eating barbecue pork. Lord have mercy. They eat eggs. Ah, I I can't believe they they they say they got the same thing we do. You imagine some of them had the office time ever was. And you hear Paul telling them, \"Look, brothers, they're heirs just like you are.\" Oh, don't you tell me that God spoke to Moses and God spoke to Abraham and God said, \"This is an everlasting covenant. How you going to break an everlasting covenant, Paul? You're a false prophet.\" He said, \"I'm telling you, brothers, it's a mystery. Will you show me where Moses said them Gentiles would come in? Paul, &gt;&gt; come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Let's take Paul to the Torah. Now, Paul, I want you to show me one scripture in the Torah that said he'd have a gentile bride and divorce Israel. Now, what would you done? You're first century believers. &gt;&gt; Some of you Jews, some of you Gentiles. &gt;&gt; And y'all come to Word of Life Church. And I stand up here to preach and I'm reading from Paul's books. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; And putting it up on the screen. &gt;&gt; But now remember in that day to a lot of those people, they did not consider those books scripture. or sacred. &gt;&gt; But some of them did. &gt;&gt; They saw it and they realized Paul had things that Peter couldn't touch. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; Paul preached things James didn't understand one thing about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? It was given to a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So has it been in this day, and I thank God for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Wherefore I was made a minister according to the gift of grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of all saints. In this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unarchable riches of Christ. This word uncarchable means astonishing and boundless treasures of grace which God has given to us and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ. So in the heart of God was this secret counsel to make a people like himself. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; How many is grateful for your dowy? &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Praise God. He is our peace. PE who has broken down every wall. Here our peace. His peace. He is our peace. who has broken down every wall. He is our peace. [Music] He is our peace. Let's sing it together now. Cast all your cares. Cast all your cares on him for he cares for you. He is our peace. Do you believe this tonight, children? He is our peace. Yes, he is. Cast all your cares on him for he cares for you. [Music] He is our peace. [Music] Check. He is our peace. Oh, he is our peace. who has broken down. Can we stand our feet now as we worship him together? Oh, thank you, Lord. He is our peace. [Music] He is our peace. Oh, he is our peace. who has broken down every wall. He is our Jesus. [Music] Whatever you need tonight, children, cast your cares on him. You're sick, you're weary, you're oppressed. Cast it on him. He bore it. He bore it for you. He is our king. Oh, cast all your cares on him. Lord, he cares for you. Oh, is our peace. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Let's just close our eyes now. Can we just raise our hands? Play it, brothers. Let's just worship him now in your own way. Remember, you were one time without the Commonwealths of Israel. You were at war against God. Oh, but now not only are you just saved, but your bride called by him, chosen by him. You got a treasure box of a dowy filled with all kinds of good things. Gifts to encourage you along your way. Healing when you're sick. Oh, it's not little dime store trinkets that you'll pull out of there. He didn't go to big lots and catch it on special, but it cost him so much. Oh, hallelujah. Along your way this journey. Oh, cast all your cares on him. I know he cares for you. [Applause] He is our peace. My Lord, you are our king. [Applause] Oh, cast all your cares on him for he cares for you. He is our peace. He is our peace. I wonder how many you are tonight sick, got a need in your body, maybe a sickness, an affliction, something you're dealing with as believers, you're commissioned by God to lay hands on one another. Was down in the meetings in Kentucky with Brother Larry Hara this past weekend. Brother John Andy's did a great job. had some singing and a brother from India also there and I spoke a couple of services and at the end of the service I had the saints of God to lay their hands on one another. The anointing of God swept in that place. It was just wonderful what the Lord did. Brother Le calling me yesterday telling me of this one that was delivered. This one was healed. That one was delivered. Not not a preacher come up run them through a prayer line. Well, this famous preacher prayed for me. But saints of God lay their hand on one another. He said, \"Brother Donnie, I believe that's just going to be the the beginning of great things we're going to hear that our God's doing.\" You know what? You get what you expect. &gt;&gt; So, if you expect a Wednesday night service, well, we ain't going to do much. I guess we'll just kind of go to church and hang out a little bit. You can hang out if you want to. I come here to worship God. &gt;&gt; And where my God is, supernatural is always made manifest. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to lay hands on one another right now, would you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, these are his words. These signs shall follow them that believe. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord Jesus. Brother Daryl, come up here and pray for the people. Hallelujah. [Music] Lord God, we believe you, Father. Hallelujah Jesus. It's in your dowy children. You can take it to the bank as we say. It will not bounce. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; this is who we are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father God. &gt;&gt; Lord, as we lay hands up on one another tonight, God, We exercise our God-given rights as believers, Lord. Believing, dear God, that heavens and earth will pass away, yet your word shall never fail, Lord. And Father God, it's written, they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover. And tonight, as sons and daughters of God, Lord, we exercise this right, God, to lay hands upon our brothers and upon our sisters, God. And we pray, God, in the name of Jesus, oh lamb of God, by that anointing that raised my Lord, from the grave. Hallelujah. And may it move, dear God, upon every need, upon every situation, God. Lord, may back trouble leave, may anxiety leave, may fear leave, may depression leave tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. May every sickness leave the people tonight. For you are our portion, dear God. You are our healer, God. You are our sustainer tonight. And we receive it, dear God. The ABCs of our healing is to accept it and to believe it and confess it. And we confess tonight, you are our healer, Satan, by the authority given to us as sons and daughters of God. We rebuke you tonight. Come out of the people. You're defeated in the name of Jesus Christ. We cast you down tonight by the power of the Holy Ghost that dwells within the hearts of the believers tonight. We receive it tonight. We accept it tonight. We confess it tonight. We are overcomers. We are the bride of Jesus Christ. We are sons and daughters of God. And every devil, every demon, sickness, death, hell itself is under the feet of the believer. And we triumph with Christ tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. We are free. The blood of the lamb of God has made us free. I accept it tonight in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God. Hallelujah. Boy, if you believe it tonight, raise your hand and accept it tonight. Raise your hand and reach. I challenge you to believe it in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Second service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whose report will you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it tonight? Oh, let the chains he has unshackled us tonight. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Whose report will you believe? As for me in my house, we shall believe the report of the Lord. For his report says we are overcomers. His report says he wrote our name in his book before the foundation of the world. His report says we are the bride of Jesus Christ. His report says every devil is under our feet. His report says we are not survivors of Leosa. We overcome leosia. Hallelujah. That's the report of my Lord. And God does not lie. Oh, do you believe it tonight? Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, whose report will you believe? [Music] Oh, who report will you believe? We shall believe the report of the Lord. I said, whose report will you believe? We shall believe the report of the Lord. Oh, his report says I am healed. His report says I am sealed. Oh, his report says I am free. His report says victory.

His report says I am sealed. For his report says I am free. His report says victory. Whose report will you believe? We shall believe the report of the Lord. Whose report will you believe? We shall believe the report of the Lord. For his report says I am healed. For his report says I am sealed. Oh his report says I am free. His report says victory. [Music] Hallelujah. Oh worship him tonight. The son has made you free. And whom the son has made free is free indeed. Amen. You're free tonight to worship in the spirit of his truth and the reality of the living God. Hallelujah. Let back pain leave. Let nerve pain leave. Let Hallelujah. Let cataracts leave the people's eyes. Let leave the people tonight. We're free. Lift up your hearts. Lift up your heads. The sun is up. He has made us free. We shall believe the report of the Lord. His report says I am healed. Thank you, Lord. His report says I am sealed. Oh, his report says I am free. His report says victory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, do you believe it tonight? &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Daryl, I don't feel one thing. He never said, \"Did you feel it?\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; But he said, \"Did you believe it?\" Yeah. &gt;&gt; If thou can believe, &gt;&gt; all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad tonight? &gt;&gt; What an hour he's been given to us &gt;&gt; to be sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We've seen it so much, friends. We've seen it so much. You've seen God. You know, Jessica came through the house one time. She's about six years old. She got that feeding tube scar in her stomach and always told her she's special cuz she looks like a belly button. She has two belly buttons. I said, \"You're special. You got two belly buttons.\" And she went on through the house playing, just playing, you know, just six-year-old, something like that. And I was sitting at the table praying and studying Genesis 24. And I said, 'Lord, if you've done so much for her, it would be a sin for me to doubt that you couldn't take that scar off of her body. And friends, he has done so much for us, this body of believers. Is that not true? &gt;&gt; It would be a sin for us to doubt that God couldn't touch something in my life. &gt;&gt; I said, I know you could take that scar from her. And this anointing, just this warm feeling come over me. voice spoke to my heart said, \"I could take that scar from her, but I left it so that every time you see it, it'll remind you of where I brought her from.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad where he's brought us from tonight, friends? &gt;&gt; He don't remember that you ever done it, but you remember. But I wonder sometimes if we don't remember, is that to remind us of where he brought us from? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Have you enjoyed the word of God tonight? Amen. Praise the Lord. Me and Sher's leaving in the morning for Galina, Missouri for some meetings starting out there tomorrow night and have to be at the airport at 5:00. So, we desire your prayers, the Lord, just give us traveling grace and bless the meetings. We'll have a prayer line, I think, on Saturday night. So, we certainly appreciate your your prayers and we certainly appreciate brother Donnie, don't we? What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful man of God. Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we come to the close of a another service, Lord, once again, oh God, have you come, Lord, and stirred our hearts. Once again, Lord, have you anointed your servant, Brother Donnie, to bring us precious words of life. And we are so grateful and we are so thankful. And Lord, tonight as a body of believers, we laid hands upon one another. And Father, I'm reminded of what your prophet told us, Lord, that if angels laid hands upon us, it would do us no good unless we accepted it. Accepted what you done. And Lord, tonight in the name of Jesus, we accept dear God that this means the way Lord of your anointing to flow from one to the other as believers laying hands. And Father, we accept that tonight as your word, Lord, and you said your word will not fail. So Lord, we accept tonight as our brothers and our sisters laid hands up on us that it was thy will being done in our lives, Lord. and we accept that which we have need of in the name of Jesus. Lord, go with your people now. Give them traveling grace and be with us tomorrow as we travel, Lord, and keep our family safe at home till we return. And we love you, Lord. We thank you once again for all that you've done for us, Lord. Be people now, Father. Renew the strength of Brother Donnie. We pray others, Lord, who was streaming tonight, not here. We pray, oh God, may the anointing go just where they're at right now, Lord, and lift that affliction off of them in the name of Jesus. That Lord, by the rising of three sons, may they know that they have been in your presence, that you have done that work in their life. Grant it, Lord, we pray as we commit these things into your hands for your glory in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you saints. You're dismissing the fear of the Lord. Remember the service this weekend.

word of the Lord we'll sing a song I don't regret a [Music] mile come on go ahead brother Bobby this makes me God's grace does for us um as many of you know I was diagnosed with therosis of the liver and a 10 cm Mass on the right side of the liver this was in about May of 2022 we had took a family trip to the Ark in Kentucky and I became very sick and while I was there I broke out in a rash that covered about 80% of my body my temperature was high I made it back home and went to the emergency room and they thought they titled it maybe a boil skin disease uh I I just looked like I'd been boiled in oil that's how my whole body looked and uh they didn't know what to do for me uh they sent me home then it escalated till I was hospitalized and they found out out it was a rare form of sasis and it only happens in random cases uh Mayo Clinic has treated two cases of it and the rest the doctor said it most doctors had never seen it on a human it was only in textbooks that they had saw it so God brought me through that but in the meantime I was uh began to swell in my abdomen and they had uh the doctors had done MRI and they determined I had therosis but I had to go in for a parenthesis and they had taken actually nine and a half 2 lers of fluid from me so I went on for a little while the fluid began to gather again and usually when this happens you're not too far from the end is what they say sometimes so but I was trusting God so I go back again they take 8 and 1/2 2 L again then my right lung filled and they took a one L of fluid out of my right lung I sat and watched them draw it out into something like a coke bottle I was uh 6 years old and we had a chance to go to brother braham's meetings in Chicago Ohio in 1960 and we we were there for five nights and two things that I remembered we were in a Pentecostal Church growing up there was a lady that they requested prayer for her name was Polly Reed and she she was in Middletown Ohio and you'll hear it on the tape it is I Be not Afraid we our family was setting two rows of seats from her when brother bam called her out he said that light was circling over there it landed first on a lady beside of her then it moved over to her and he told her he said you have a hole in your heart and you're going to die well we had just heard that testimony about 3 weeks before that in our hometown Church in Virginia never did we believe that we would see that lady so she was healed immediately I'm giving you this background to to try to encourage you with faith uh on the night he preached the reject the king there was a lady laying across from me on a stretcher and she looked like the great niece of Florence Nightingale she was Skin and Bones she's able to barely raise her hand up off the cot brother R's getting ready to leave the platform and he turned back and looked in our Direction he said what was that past me he said that wasn't an uler he said that was a cancer devil well he immediately prayed for her and I saw her with my own eyes get up off that cot and Shout to the glory of God I whispered to my mother I said how is she standing on those legs or nothing but broomsticks but she did that was a platform for for the faith that I I got when this when I got this diagnosis so I go to the doctor and they say well you got the therosis you got a 10 cm Mass it's possibly cancer first wanted to do surgery maybe a transplant then they come back and said you don't qualify for either so I said you you giv me no hope medically they said no I said well I've got a high power that has the final answer so I would not take any drugs any chemo uh they they actually got mad at me because I wouldn't go the route they wanted me to go but seeing this from my childhood I knew God was the same yesterday today and forever and I have testified that to many of these brothers they can tell you that I've said that after saying this as a young boy that God was the same and he still is I don't care what you're going through what you've been diagnosed with you don't have fear and you get up every day and you testify you thank God for healing you that's what I did and I'm still standing here today they did a MRI and a again about a year ago the doctor three months ago said well you know you've got cancer don't you I said well that's what they say I never have said I have this or I don't have it I said they say I have it but I'm not testifying to that so they don't you know they couldn't couldn't hardly grasp that so but anyway uh I was uh recovering doing better and I was on a platform on Wednesday night playing the guitar but I still very weak in my body I was hardly able to walk brother Daryl had prayed for his last person here and uh I I wanted to get up and go down but I was too weak I didn't think I could get back up if I did so I said God I saw this as a child I said I don't have to go to him you can send him to me that was the very words I said in my heart he prayed for the last person I was sitting here in the old church he put his coat across his arm he walked toward me and he turned around looked at me like he had never seen me before he walked straight to me and started praying for me from that time on my health started turning and by the grace of God I'm standing here today and can give you this testimony no matter what the devil tells you don't accept it it's it's not the final answer he's a blood and go go about your life brother BR said go about your life and don't fear I had no fear I can honestly say with my hand over my heart when they told me the diagnosis I walked through the valley of the shadow of death but I had no fear because I knew if he he took care of me all the rest of my life he could do it this time that's right so brothers and sisters no matter what he tells you don't fear it brother Ram said do not fear it and you go about your life and you sing and you give God praise and you thank him every day for what he's done and you will see the results God bless you I think brother Bobby could say that he doesn't regret one mile that he's traveled for the Lord and that right there is why because if he didn't believe in him he could have left him there to die but instead he healed him and there he is amen let's sing this old song I don't regret one mile I've traveled for the Lord and I don't re ret one time I trusted in his words I've seen the years go by many days without a song but I don't regret one m that I traveled for the Lord let's sing it one more time oh I don't regret one m i Trav for the Lord and I don't regret one time I've trusted in his word I've seen the years go by many days without a song but I don't regret one m I traveled for the Lord no oh I don't regret [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] D for the you can say Amen to that can't you brother Jackie seemed like I was uh well I was just a a young boy and the Lord spoke to me down on the river that day and told me to preach then he spoke to me told me when I turned 30 I'd start traveling and so when I turned 30 I got an invitation down into South Carolina and that kind of got me traveling and then I traveled for years and worked 40 hours a week and I come home sometimes 3 4:00 in the morning and sat in the chair for a little bit and throw water in my face and go to work then in June of 2000 I was coming back from lunch going back to surgery come around the corner of a hallway there at the VA hospital and just walked right into the presence of the Lord he was just hanging there and I just begin to weep a voice spoke to me and said go preach my word so in 2000 I went fulltime and 24 years later I don't regret a mile that I've traveled for the Lord amen he's he's been so good for all of us and that's what we want to look at tonight is to know that none of us are here by accident but there's a purpose for all of us if you have your Bibles turn with us tonight to the book of Ephesians want to read from Ephesians chapter 3 verse 11 and brother Justin talking about 911 as we remember that that day and he was right he was at our house was having a little birthday party for Carissa and Allison uh the day that that happened and I guess everybody remembers where they was at when they got news of that that terrible day but amen Ephesians 3 we just want to read one verse there of verse 11 trust something to be said tonight to help you to encourage you that's truly the reason that we came and I don't uh know all that everybody here is facing or what you're going through with individually and how many needs would be here tonight but there's one thing that I do know is that there's not a need in the building that's greater than our God there's not one diagnosis that you've got that God wasn't aware of didn't take God by surprise it might have shocked you but not God he knew all about it can you believe that tonight he's got it all in control I said he's got it all in control Ephesians 3:11 the the Bible says this according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord now Eternal means without beginning and end that which always has been and always will be without beginning Without End never to cease Eternal may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our heads I want to speak to you tonight on God God's undefeatable Eternal purpose God's undefeatable Eternal purpose or if I could take a context out of that I'd like to say the man who wrote the book says I'm one of them Heavenly Father we thank you for your word Lord and we thank you for the opportunity to stand before your people we surrender this congregation and oursel into your hands For Your Glory may you come tonight Lord and speak Words of Life to our hearts and Lord may we not just be hearers of the word as James said but may we be doers of that which we've heard may we accept it believe it and confess it for we know that is the ABCs of our healing that is the ABCs of our walk dear God is to believe what you said in your word about us we commit these things into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name and the bride says amen God bless you may be S seated thank you buddy now I want to draw this first into your mind that there's not one thing that can destroy us until the purpose of he who created us has been fulfilled there could be nothing that could destroy us not one thing until the purpose of he who created us has been fulfilled there could be nothing the prophet said so then we come to understand this evening that we are made for a purpose you see this church here T night that we're in and we thank God for it it's such a such a beautiful building but this Foundation that was dug this building the roof and the interior and that was put in it was not just done all this wasn't just done to see if it could be done it was put here for a purpose your home that you was in before you come to church tonight was not just accidentally put there for somebody just wasting time where well we'll just see if we can build this no your home was made for a purpose your home was made to serve a purpose the automobile you drove here tonight was not made just to see if it could be made the material was not wasted by man it was made for a purpose to serve a purpose the clothing that you wear tonight was not just to see if somebody could design or fashion a piece of clothing no it was put for a purpose the food that you eat was not grown on the earth just to see if it could be grown but the food that we eat was grown to serve a purpose amen and God just not uh just didn't just happen to be making a tree just to be making a tree but he made a tree for a purpose and I want to say tonight that God made you not just to see if he could do it but God Made You for a purpose amen therefore there is a purpose for all of us being here we're not here here just to be another human being but we are here because God made you for some purpose we W just put here to eat the food that God grow we're not just put here to live in a house that some man made or or to drive an automobile that somebody created or wear clothes that somebody fashion but we are here for a specific purpose the trees God didn't have to make trees the way he made them but he made the trees for a purpose though they're different from one another yet he made each tree for a purpose purpose he could have make trees any way he wanted to make them he could have made flowers any way he wanted to make flowers but he made all of them the trees and the flowers everything he made for a purpose and what was that purpose to give a witness to give a testimony oh think about that he just didn't make a tree to be making it but he made a tree for a purpose that it would be a witness that it could give a testimony some people well that's just a tree but to God it's a witness it's a testimony he made them to Bear witness for they are God's Witnesses they are a true witness that all other religions is false and Jesus Christ is right the very trees that God placed upon the Earth will condemn some of these false religions for the trees the that God himself created serve a purpose to give a witness that Jesus Christ is right the death burial and Resurrection gives a witness that we are not dead eternally but we shall live again amen it shows a supreme intelligence look at the sun the prophet said when it comes out in the morning what's what happens to the sun it's a little baby born in the East about 10:00 it's a teenager at noon time it's in its strength in the evening time it's middle aged and at the evening time it's gone it's set it's finished but is that all there is of the sun no God's got a purpose for the Sun so the Sun comes back and rises again what does it what does it speak of it speaks of a birth a life a death and a resurrection Hallelujah it goes to show that it was made by a supreme intelligence to serve a purpose it's here for a purpose and I say tonight if that's true for for a flower if that's true for a tree if that's true for the sun then what about you what about you do you think we just accidentally fell into this thing you think God just accidentally created us I tell you no as the tree has a purpose and the flower has a purpose and the sun has a purpose to give a witness to be a testimony God has created you Hallelujah to be a witness no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are how unimportant you are you're here to serve a purpose it don't matter how old you are how young you are every person here was here for a purpose to serve a purpose just as my finger is here for a purpose and the nail on my finger is here for a purpose my eye and every part of my body is here for a purpose sure this little finger maybe not look as much as the as the bless of my eye but it's still a part of my body and it serves a purpose and I need that nail on the little finger come on somebody well I'm not the eye I'm not the tongue I'm not the ear but I don't care if I'm just a little toe on the foot the last toe where that little crease touches the foot if that's who I am in the body I still am here to serve a purpose hallelujah amen my eye every part of my body is here to serve for purpose it was not put here just to see what it would look like when it was put here but it was put here to serve its purpose it was God's divine plan to do so and if we were put here for a purpose then there's nothing nothing that can destroy us till God's purpose is fulfilled I make a Baptist shout I said there is nothing that can harm us until the purpose that God has put us here has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much heartache we have how sorrow that we go through all these things are for a reason God is not the author of confusion and everything that happens in our life God has a purpose for allowing it to happen amen and no matter what we Face the sorrow the pain the disappointment the sickness the fear all the things that we face as human beings has not been put here to destroy us because our purpose Hallelujah cannot be defeated by the things we suffer Hallelujah Hallelujah no matter how much heartache no matter how much sorrow all these things are a reason there's a reason for it but nothing you face in life will defeat the purpose that God has brought for your life it's the undefeatable Eternal purpose of the almighty God oh Hallelujah God placed you here you didn't stagger into this thing he could have put us in Luther's day Wesley's day he could put us in the days of Paul he could put us in the days of Jesus we could have been one of the discipl I Les but he chose this age this time this season this place to place you here it was not by accident but God knew in the last day in this age of confusion and lies and all the distress and all the darkness he knew he could put you here because he knew you would believe him when he spoke amen hallelujah Nations a lie to you governments a lie to you family a lie to you come on somebody but the word of God will never lie to us hallelujah and he knew he could have you here he could place you here and against all and against all darkness and against all confusion and against all denominations and against all internets somebody would believe his word and he said that's you I placed you here because I know you're the Seed of Abraham and Abraham's seed believes God when he speaks Hallelujah I'm not based well I got a sensation I'm not basing on a sensation I'm not basing it on the Goosebump I'm basing on thus sayth the word of God Sensations a lie to us emotions a lie come on somebody those things a lie to us but the word of God will never lie to us hallelujah well brother I want you to know I got it when you shouted no you got it when you believed that's right well Glory Hallelujah the undefeatable Eternal purpose of God God placed you here as a true witness of God that all other religions is false and Jesus Christ well brother Dar what's the answer to believe the sign what is the answer to believe the sign on Facebook and on the Internet it's you Hallelujah he put you here to be a true witness that all other religions is false and Jesus Christ is right think about it go with me for a few minutes in your mind before there was ever an angel a star a planet there was no air there was no life there was no stars there was no World there was nothing else it was God and God Alone Ella Ella Elohim which means the self-existing one there was nothing else existed but him and the self-existing one that we call God but before there was ever anything to worship him he was just a self-existing one and the self-existing one had a desire he had a purpose something that he wanted to achieve and he purposed within himself that he would do this thing and he spoke let there be light and there was like why he purposed it and the Darkness could not stop the light from coming forth because God's purpose can never be defeated amen hallelujah no matter how mysterious it may seem to be God always keeps his word God keeps his word if God makes a promise of anything God will keep that promise you and I make promises we intend to keep but things happen that we have to to break a promise but not God oh no he knows all the future from the beginning he don't make a promise unless he knows what's going to happen and he always keeps his promise God Don't Make A Promise unless he knows it's going to unless he knows he's going to keep it unless he knows what's going to happen Hallelujah he will not make a promise unless he knows he's going to keep it other words God just don't say something to be sa if God says something he means it and if God says he'll do something he'll bankrupt all Heaven before he'll let that promise fail you God purposed within himself to prove his word he said I will prove my word to be the truth listen to me I don't believe God heals people just to show his power to heal that's not why God heals he heals to fulfill his word for the word says He Is A Healer amen he shows he fulfills his word he keeps his promise when he came here on the earth the first time he said that he did this that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets listen to me all God's word must be fulfilled all of it all of it all of it God's purpose can never be defeated there's nothing that can defeat it so how happy we all to be today are you happy y let your face know it come on somebody he's got it all in control oh brother darl you don't know what I'm going through with you don't know what I'm going through with but that don't matter that don't change God's program that don't change God's purpose that don't change God's plan he's still God he's still mov come on somebody he's got it all in control he's not lost his power he's not a do old Grand Pa sleeping somewhere God is on the throne amen how happy we ought to be today resting upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there's neither things present nor things that can come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils nor nothing that can separate us from the purpose of the Living God what God has imagined in his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring the past there is no demon there is no power there is nothing that can ever separate God's Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God has said Hallelujah God said let a virgin conceive and bring forth a child and it was as God said God said behold i s you Elijah before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and it was as God said that's right God said there'll be a bride she'll be bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh Spirit of my spirit and she is she is him and it is as God has said there will be a bride brother I reckon when she'll come she's here brother Bon said in 64 he said the bride is born in infancy the word is come forth through the end time friends we're at the end time in' 64 it was a bride in infancy but what's happened between 60 64 and 2024 the bride has come to maturity she's reached the age of love She's reached the season she can reproduce him again on the earth Hallelujah think of it the heavenly father do you think for one minute that the heavenly father will be defeated in his purpose even though Satan has done what he's done it's an impossibility he will not be defeated and he's given us perfect assurance that we will not have to be scared of anything amen what the father has purposed in your life can never be defeated the undefeatable eternal purpose of God for your life think about that you see what do you mean well think of David David was anointed by the great prophet Samuel to be king and between the ages of 10 and 15 year old who was 9' N9 in tall and saw the king that David no doubt looked up to he tells David you're just a youth you're too young you can't do it and Goliath has been a Warrior from his Youth and you're still a youth but the giant that stood before David did not see the God who was with David Hallelujah if he did he would have turned from the battle amen but God done said to David you will reign as king it came through a prophet's message God sent a prophet to tell David what his future was he might have preached future home to him come on somebody God sent a prophet to tell David not only what was happening right now but things that are to be and God told David through a prophet you will reign his King now how can he die by a giant as a boy and reign as king so David took God at his word and as far as the word was was concerned Goliath was defeated before the battle ever started because God's purpose for David's life could not be defeated by a giant and the giant that tries to R over your life cannot defeat God's purpose for your life amen you said brother darl I've got a giant raining in my life right now I've got this mountain as a boy told me Sunday down when he come up for gra me want me to pray for him he said I've got this mountain that needs to be moved but let me tell you no mountain can stand in the way of God's purpose for your life amen no jant no trial no habit no sickness no disease come on somebody there is nothing n o t h n nothing that can defeat God's purpose for our life it'll be as God has said it will be Shad M shako Flo into a furnace heated up seven times hotter than it ever been heated before and we said they said whether God would deliver us this we do not know but there's one thing we do know he is more than able to deliver us he's able to deliver us but nonetheless we will not bow to this image and the prophet said God had someone who would serve him and his purpose would not be defeated fire cannot defeat the purpose of God's plan and the prophet said how we left the say this morning all the hydrogen bombs in the world can never defeat the resurrection of his church well brother Daryl you reckon Putin I don't care what Putin's going to do he ain't going to do nothing but what God allow him to do amen and if they push one button we'll be gone before it ever strikes the United States yeah all the bombs they have all the threats they have the imminent oh my yo everybody's looking for a donkey they're looking for Harris or they're looking for Trump to save this nation they believe in a donkey tell you this nation don't need a donkey nor an elephant it needs a lamb they rejected the thing that they [Applause] needed all the bombs in the world can never defeat the resurrection of his church all the explaining the way all the mathematics so forth the intelligence of the world has disguised the purpose to do something about to destroy the faith of God's children don't you understand they'll never crucify him again but the prophet said what is the third crucifixion brother Jackie the crucifying the effects of the word that can never nail him to a tree again that's been done one time but what they they do now through the websites through the books come on somebody they try to take the word of God and make it no effect in your life amen come on somebody but the Bible said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the the word of God so what did they do they tried to explain it away by their intelligence they try to explain it away by their mathematics something trying to destroy the faith of God's children all this believe the sign trash all these books that they buy on Amazon it's a bunch of nonsense I said it's a bunch of nonsense you think I'm going to believe somebody that wrote a book that can't do one miracle that don't know God from a hot and to come on somebody I serve the Living God tonight and he promised to send Elijah the prophet and he kept his word and he sent that prophet to me and he opened the seals and he revealed to me my purpose for being on the earth amen there is no book from Amazon going to take that away from me Hallelujah the prophet said they'll never do it that faith that faith will live on forever Moses when he talking and all the wisdom of the Egyptians when he knew that God had a purpose for his life what did that Revelation come from his mother said she was the Fifth Gospel it was Joseph his mother who took Moses and shoved him right out into the jaws of death what did she take him to what were they doing with these Hebrew children they was throwing them into the river they was feeding them to the crocodiles and and what did yed do she knew that God delivered Noah by an ark so she built an ark for her baby and what did she do she pushed it right out there in the now where all the crocodiles was she pushed it right out into the jaws of death why would she do that because she knew God's purpose could not be defeated amen there wasn't enough water in an aisle to drown him there wasn't enough crocodiles in all the world that could swallow him he was God's chosen and he was God's chosen for that purpose and nobody could take his place we are God's chosen today we believe in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus there's no bombs there's no hell there's no nothing else that can destroy God's purpose we have got to go into the resurrection it's promise it's a promise that we have of our God Amen he said there will be a Rapture as far as God's concerned we already have Moses on the back side of the desert out there the the screams and the HTS and the Wilderness stagging around almost perishing but he knew that nothing could defeat God's purpose huh for God had placed him there God had put Moses there to do what God told him to do cuz his purpose cannot be defeated think of Joseph and and mared a child the child was to be born in Bethlehem not on the road to Bethlehem not on the hill to Bethlehem not at the city welcome sign of Bethlehem it had to be Bethlehem because the word of God called for it listen to me Mary Don't Be Afraid Of The Journey Don't worry about the mule Dy don't worry about the thieves on the road we're on the journey to the Eternal purpose of God the child will be born in in Bethlehem the word will become flesh in Bethlehem why God purposed for it to be oh little bride don't be afraid of the journey we were born for a purpose and that's to reproduce Jesus Christ in flesh again Hallelujah God watched over them AGI why because they had the appropriate gifts to identify his presence on the earth there was nothing that would stop them from getting to Jesus Jesus they were born to identify him on the earth then what have we been put here to do little bride I tell you we have been put here to identify him on the Earth today amen making him the same yesterday today and forever we're more than a church member we're more than a message believer come on somebody the devil believes and trembles we're more than that we was born for a purpose God wrote your name with Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world he knew the color of your skin he knew the color of your hair he knew the color of your eyes he knew your name and wrote your name with Jesus why Brother David why would he write my name with Jesus why brother Jackie because we are join AES hallelujah hallelujah when you really realize that God has revealed to you the truth of the thing there's nothing in the world going to defeat you in it that's all you are absolutely undefeatable well brother I don't feel that way he never said did you feel it he said did you believe it if you believed it you might start feeling it there is nothing in the world that's going to defeat you in it that's all you are absolutely undefeatable you got to turn to your neighbor and say you're undefeatable well that was weak well you'll say it sooner or later you are absolutely undefeatable not you but the god that's in you not Christ not Christ the body but the word that was in him not Mary but the word that was born from her then let's go from here tonight with this understanding we will not be defeated there is nothing that is is coming there is nothing that Satan is bringing there is nothing that can stop this bride we may have trials we may have troubles but there is nothing that will stop this bride from fulfilling the purpose of God for the bride will not be defeated and God's purpose will not be defeated he has given us perfect Assurance amen that we are the bride and we will not be defeated therefore we have nothing to fear amen did not he tell his disciples that night when they were scared did not he say Be not Afraid when he stepped in the boat him man I turned to him and said don't you understand what's happening don't you understand what you're experiencing don't you understand where you're at the word is being made flesh do you understand where you're at forence not a Creed not a Dogma the word is being made flesh amen listen you were made for an eternal purpose because you are the manifestation of an attribute you are the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you he made an earth to take you out of to make you a human being every man that come to Christ must first be child trained for the purpose that God has ordained you for and remember if you can just keep quiet remember if he's called you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening listen a young Minister don't have to try to produce his ministry brother Joe if God's called him God will open the doors that's right come on somebody you see it so much nowadays where they adverti theirself on the internet make theirself available but if God's called you for this God Will Make A Way for it to happen amen hallelujah God has ordained for you just keep Ste remember if he's called you for this there's nothing that can keep it from happening there's not enough devils in torment but what God's word will be made manifest you were born for a purpose and nobody can take your place you might have impersonators and everything else but they'll never take your place God's word will Triumph it cannot fail that's where every Christian ought to stand knowing trials will come up and seem every way to you but remember God has a purpose and it will all work out right amen I don't understand it he never asked us to understand it but he did ask us if we believed him yes sir amen I remember that night sure I was crying and I got a basket for her to throw up in cuz she's so upset she said I've lost my daddy I've lost my sister she said why would God do this for us my little baby why would he do this she said you're gone all the time you're never home you're traveling why would he do this to us I said listen honey I don't know I don't know why this is happening but there's one thing I do know sometimes God don't ask us to understand he just ask us can we trust him can we trust what he's doing he'll make a way for us somehow some way he didn't bring us this far to leave us he didn't build a home in us to move away come on somebody he never taught us this s to let us drown and he never lifted us up in this hour to let us down he's got it all in control oh my let me hurry what was Jesus manifested for why was Jesus manifested on the earth to show God did not they say show us the father he said have I not been with you so long what was he here to do to show us God then what has the bride manifested for what is she manifested for why is she here in this hour why is he raised her up in these last days what is she therefore to show God what's more of this world will hear from God it'll be through his bride for the final voice to the final age amen do you love him he sent the life that he lived by he sent that life back to the church the Holy Spirit God's purpose we find here of sending the Holy Spirit back to the church was for one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church that was God in Christ continuing the plans through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his Works through the church continuing his work through the church the God that was in Christ continued his plan through Christ and out of Christ into the church to continue his work through the church he was God he had to be no man could die no Prophet could die he was God he was the god of the prophets he was the prophets he was the Kings he was the history he was he that was to come he was he that was he that is and he that's to be in this day the same yesterday today and forever he was manifested for that purpose and through that purpose he achieved the church that he might have the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in these last days when he gets the preeminence the preeminence in the church the position his place in the church Jesus said he that believeth in me works I do shall he do also and even more than this shall he do for I go to the father's sea that was his purpose there was the manifestation and now today he wants to get somebody who can so see it that they can let the word manifest through them someone who can so see the purpose of God the plan of God that they can let the word manifest through them Jesus so seated was so perfectly born for the day until God expressed every move that he made he was God's revelation God revealed then this Ransom Church of the last day purposed by God to be here what is she she is not a Creed she is not a Dogma she is not a she is not a denomination what is she she is the revelation God revealed in flesh once again what is this

great secret that was in God's mind is now put into the heart of the believer what was once God's Great mysterious secret that was in his mind has now been placed in the heart of the believer that is the body of Christ what was God's once God's Great Secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest where in you think of it Lord think of it oh my wow because God promised

wind strong enough that will stop this bride amen they ain't got nothing that will stop you there's no not a sickness there's not a trial that'll keep us from achieving God's Great Eternal purpose for our lives there's something within us it's a fire that's burning a light that's been lit by God and no Breeze can blow it out there's no cold spell in the church there's no indifference among the people there's no persecution of the world can can blow out that flame that God has lit for God has purposed that his torch light of Freedom will burn until the coming of the Lord and no powers no powers that Satan has can blow it out they will only make it burn brighter as they blow as they criticize as they come against it they will not shut it down it will just burn brighter I've been touched by a fire let the world come and watch me burn [Applause] I can't put it out we've seen him I've seen him in the promised word for this day then hear his voice hear his voice in this hour

can we rest can we rest in his plan how many of you remember brother Alfred Hall anybody remember brother Hall you know brother Hall was a pretty dark skinned man wasn't he well here a few year ago they had a mungon reunion now some of you may not know what a mungon is but a mungon they call them the mysterious people out of the hills of Tennessee and Virginia over here and some people claim they were Cherokees some claimed they were pugie and genre and I don't know what all they claimed these people to be but there was actually a tri-racial people they were white black and Native American reason I know so much about it a lot of my mama's people the Goodman and the Moors and the Gibsons and the Sweeny they was all identified as that so here a few year ago they had a mungon reunion up in Virginia and me and my brother went to it and we was walking out through there now they had brother they had a man by the name of Brent Kennedy Dr Brent Kennedy and he wrote a book on the mungon it's called the mungon a mysterious people actually have the book there in my study and so we was walking around up there at this melon reunion and I told my brother Dwayne I said I tell

that book Brett Kennedy the mysterious melons of mysterious people I said I knew you'd be here he said yeah he said the man that wrote the book said I'm one of them and I've come to tell youall come on now the man who wrote the book the author of this book The Bible said he is the author and finisher of our faith amen and he's come to tell us he's come to tell us the author of this book has come to tell us according to Romans 8:30 moreover whom he did prate him whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified

many things how many how many amen this bride is lacking nothing he has freely given us all things he's given us joy he's given us peace he's given us Health he's given us Redemption he's given us for he's given us forgiveness he's given us the Holy Ghost he's given us the promise of a Rapture he has freely given us all things the author of the book said [Applause] so who shall lay anything to charge elect to God's elect it is God that justifi who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also make intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of God of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter they and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded can I get an amen I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angel nor principality nor power nor things present nor things to come nor hyp nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord then what should we be we are children of the promise being dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed and our HS with him with the promise no matter how much sickness comes what kind of death we die how much poverty we go through God's purpose cannot be defeated he will raise us up again for he said because I live ye shall live also the author of this book said no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the her of the Servants of the Lord and the righteousness is of me saith the Lord that's what the author said well so and so and well they got this book I don't care what they say that's what the author said I think I shared this with you but I it just came on my heart here a few years ago

so the man comes you know he's kind of famous so all these people come into the bookstore and gathered around going to get him to sign this book you know and they're going to listen as he gave his interpretation of the book and he started out he said now in chapter one what the author was trying to say was this and when it got done oh that was just so good chapter two they chapter three when he got to chapter 4 he said now in chapter 4 what the author was trying to say was thus and thus and thus and just as the people got ready to clap there was the man in the crowd said nope that ain't right sort of like saying Amen in the church everybody turn around and see who it was that said it you know and so he goes on to chapter five and every chapter five six 7even the guy says Nope ain't

God for that this life is hard enough the way it is can you imagine having to walk alone without the Lord in your life without him being the guidepost and helping you through all the things of life I know I know people do it every day but I ain't one of them aren't you glad you ain't one of them I know people think it's small it's inferior when I was in China several years ago and preaching in those meetings there there were professors School teachers people of every occupation that you you can imagine and the type that the communist government thought would not search for God if you can educate them and give them this and that then that'll do away with the need of God yeah but I sat there and looked at them people and I thought there was still something in them even though they were professors teachers mathematicians and all of that but you can't satisfy the soul with mass amen you can't satis y it with algebra you can't satisfy it with money it's made to search for God when it's all said and done friends and when our heart is slowing down the blood pressure is dropping and we get ready to cross over all you own won't amount to nothing what you think you are won't amount to nothing what's going to really matter is you know him I'm glad I do don't you let's turn tonight to Matthew chapter 16 how are y'all we're well doing good doing good thanks for asking how he's happy to be in the house of the Lord ain't it wonderful to be a Christian just awesome to be a be a child of God Matthew chapter 16 verse 18 let's look tonight and see what we are a part of by the grace of the Lord the Lord Jesus saying these words and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church I will build my church now what is an organization an organization is a man-made system there are also many independent churches that are manmade churches yeah if Jesus don't build them they're not hisen now people can put his name on the sign that still don't mean he built that church because Jesus uses a particular type of material and this is the way you'll always know that Jesus founded whatever Church you're going to whatever one you're looking at or fellowshipping or whatever the traits of the Builder will be in there and you'll be able to identify it by its characteristics its traits its foundation and the building material that is used this is it Upon This Rock I will build my church so what was the rock of course The Rock was Revelation revelation of who he is not who he was so the churches of this day that are built by Jesus himself will be focusing on who and what he is in 2023 and shortly 2024 right so if they're built upon a memory of what he was 2,000 years ago that's not a church that Jesus Built right amen cuz Upon This Rock he said I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it acts 15 verse1 now some traits and characteristics of this church now a few years after Jesus starts building and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved now notice certain men don't call them Brethren just calls them men certain men came down from Judea and taught the Brethren yeah so here was some men that were not Brethren but they were teaching the Brethren how in the world did that happen so you got man that's not even born again and somehow the Brethren let them among them and start teaching them wow that ought to be a double wow we ought to take warning an't that amazing certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except you speak in tongues you ain't got to hold holy ghost or except you run and Shout you're not the bride I see then it was circumcision but it's changed in every age and it's happening in our ranks as well that we're making new evidences of what the bride is we've had so many bride revivals I can't even keep up with them but let me tell you what the bride Revival won't be the bride's Revival will not be hacking and splicing and cutting the word or the message and putting it together to fit your idea it won't be that now of course they were saying this because this was such an important thing in that day and this day we don't even think nothing about it so the evidence will change but that Spirit never changed except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no SM small no small dissension and disputation with them wow so Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and Elders about this question now you see because the scarecrow has been so effective for thousands of years if we would try to do this today in our message people would start screaming denomination denomination denomination you know why the scarecrow has started scaring Eagles now this is the way the original Church operated and the devil put up a scarecrow of the name of denomination and they started pulling some of these things out of there and Satan knew it would scare the elect from the 3 Century right on down and it still scared them notice in verse three and being brought on their way by the church they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and they caused Great Joy unto all the Brethren and when they were come to Jerusalem they were received of the church and of the Apostles and Elders wow Paul the prophet a church AG messenger had to be received by the church and by the apostles and the elders oh why didn't he get this attitude I don't care if y'all don't think I'm of God or not glory to God go on to Hell well that's the attitude a lot of the men message folks have I did say message folks not real Believers you see real message Believers know that brother bram's message is not something new on now it's a restoration to the original amen now you see a lot of message people do not believe that they can never believe a lot of the doctrines they do they could never stay home play tapes don't need preachers no more all that the reason they believe that is because they believe this message is something totally new and if you believe that tonight I pray to God you get the Holy Ghost before you leave this service cuz you ain't got it now cuz the Holy Ghost will never lead you to believe a lie because the prophet messenger come to return the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers and the church said and they declared all sa that God had done for them I me like to be remembered tonight as we pray sister Wendy Asher has an aunt that has a real need and they want this prayer cloth so just hold that request in your heart as well as you pray over what you have need of heavenly father we so love you tonight oh I'm so glad to be back in church I'm so thankful when you saved me you saved me to go to church you saved me to sing you saved me to worship you saved me to pray you saved me to live right you saved me to Rejoice you saved me from heaven and you saved me from hell I don't worry about being lost cuz I didn't come from there and I ain't going going there how grateful We Are Tonight Lord Jesus for your mercy father as we approach your word tonight we're asking for your help we're asking dear God that you'd help me to get out of the way help the people to be able to enter in the service Lord they've worked today many of them and no doubt they're tired and would your presence just come and catch us up Lord father I know there's several that's sick and couldn't be with us in service tonight we ask that You' be mindful of them Lord I have this prayer cost in my hand for sister Wendy's Aunt you know all about this need and request and we believe you father that you're going to move for dear God we desire to be with all of our hearts one of those churches that has been turned back to the apostolic faith help us I pray Lord God In The Name of Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you you may be seated now I'm sure that you all believe already tonight that just because people say they are Apostolic does not mean that they are the original Apostolic anybody here ever belong to the UPC Church of God in Christ few of you Church of God in Christ one is Church of God the black side of that UPC thing probably nobody many of them claim to be Apostolic but basically what they preach is one God and they don't even have it correct and water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus I was at a funeral some time ago of an Apostolic man a family member close to someone of mine and the preacher which was Apostolic of course got up and every way that he could he tried to bring in Acts 238 and uh speaking in tongues evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues and preaching this guy's funeral but also trying to get forth his Apostolic Doctrine now many of those Apostolic preachers they they are specifically known for acts 238 and a lot of them turn into preachers that carry an Acts and 238s so that's all they know how to do with that scripture is fight with it and they will fight you and they will get angry and they will get upset and they have no mercy whatsoever for someone that maybe God has never opened their understanding to that so they take their Axe and cut their heads off and if there's anything left they pull out both 38s and finish them off with that and as I sat there listening to that man's funeral and I thought you know I knew the man well and knew the man was a good man loved God with all of his heart but yet this preacher saw it as an opportunity to be able to convey once again their so-called Apostolic Doctrine but I had talked to some of those people years before about the message ah mentioned predestination serpent SE some of the different doctrines that we know the apostles actually preached and what I found was that those Apostolic people wasn't Apostolic at all they were Apostolic denomination so because they baptized in jesus' name and because they preach the tongues as the evidence of the Holy Ghost and you shout and this and that then you're true Apostolic no you're just Apostolic by name but there is a true Apostolic people on the face of the Earth today so true Apostolic people are built upon the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets so the true Apostolic people are those that can tie their original Roots back to the church in the book of Acts which was what Jesus started himself now Jesus said himself on this rock I will build my church now it may be kind of offensive a little bit but as I said earlier every church that's built on every Church Corner between here and Memphis and back is not built by the Lord Jesus because Jesus could go in there and start just preaching a little bit about his word we'll say he would start in the Book of John and he might say something like this in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and many might come on down to verse 14 and say and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth some of them might make it to the end of that and say amen and then we might bring Jesus over to St John 10 when Jesus would say I and my father are one amen we might bring him over to where Phillip said so Lord show us the father and he said Phillip have I been with you so long and you don't know who I am if you see me you see the father well right there a bunch of the trinitarians would fall out of their Pew would they and yet they claim to be following Jesus well Jesus was actually the one who said that and then we come over to the first church AG messenger that was the foundation stone that God began to build a lot of these Revelations on what he gave him and he would say something like this for without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest In the Flesh just in the justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles who did God God then we might come to the book of Titus where he said Hing to and the coming of the day of God in that day when the Lord Jesus will come himself you mean calling Jesus God not one of them but him Jesus wasn't one of the Gods in heaven he was the only one and we might move over to the Book of Revelation when John was carried up and he said I saw one and I saw a throne not three but I saw one throne and he that sat upon the throne was to look upon as a Jasper and a Sardis Stone which was the birth stones of the tribes of Israel so I wonder how many churches in the tri cities that the Lord Jesus would Acclaim that he himself started that church and it would be identification that all would know because the building material that church is built upon so it's built upon the Revelation then of who Jesus is in this age and yet many of them will take people down to the water and they'll say in obedience to the Commandment of the Lord Jesus I baptize you in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost so in other words you spiritually baptize them into the Catholic Church well glory to God I thought y'all was Apostolic here tonight so I wonder then how many of them that Jesus would stand up and say I did not build my church upon the teaching that speaking in tongues was the evidence of the Holy Ghost well there'd be some more that'd get mad at Jesus and then others that would say well you know I I believe once in Grace always in Grace and once you get saved as a matter of fact this I was going hunting this last week and on and one of the brothers just telling me that he had Hunted been around a guy up there where we were some time before this and the guy was cussing I mean cussing everything off the hinges and the brother asked him he said uh what do you do he said I'm a licensed ordained minister oh my goodness so I doubt Jesus would want to put his arm around that dude and call him buddy wouldn't you so you can imagine then one church after another after another the Lord Jesus J would say you are not mine I never built this church as a matter of fact this one was built by this organization or this man or this or that or the other this is not even my church my name is not here my Revelation is not what built you it was built out of Envy or Strife or whatever more this is not my church it's going to be surprising when we get to the end of the way and a lot of people stand before the Lord and they will stand there sinking you know that I've done this and that and the other and the Lord Jesus will look at them and I know some of the brothers right now don't like it whenever preachers will still preach on Matthew 24:24 but I've got to because I'm a Full Gospel preacher and I believe in healings and signs and wonders and miracles but by no means do I believe that the bride's only identification is the miraculous because there's going to be all kinds of people that's going to stand before the Lord and say we cast out Devils we raise the Dead We heal the sick in your name come on church and they will absolutely be anointed I heard the prophet say it today it is the true anointing of the Holy Ghost but they are anointed falsely to the word so you mean the spirit of God would come upon people and anoint them fall ly to the word so you don't judge them by their signs or their miracles or how much they jump or dance or shout but what you judge them by is the word that includes me that includes every other preacher that includes every one of us and the church said am so the church then that Jesus is going to come for in the last days is going to be an Apostolic Bible believing church now keep in mind that God did not send brother brandom in order to replace our Bible but to make our Bible more real to us is that right is that the way you believe it and understand it so he did not come to sim brother brandom so that people would formulate their doctrines outside of the context of scripture and they would come up with all kinds of strange ideas which of course is going to be in every age but he would come right back cuz when he would be on the curtain of time and he saw his people only didn't see Paul's did not see Luther's did not see Wesley's but he saw his only and whenever he reconciled and he told the angel said if Paul's group goes in mine will and then those thousands I heard him say it today that there was hundreds of thousands of those people looked like there could have been millions that was there and they screamed out we are resting on that and they said one day Jesus will come to you and you will be judged and if you are accepted and you will be then we will go in on your teaching so that would be totally impossible for us to go in on brother brandom's teaching unless he was a word Prophet praise the Lord so Paul didn't say one thing and brother Ram say something else now he might have said it in a Kentucky way where Paul said it in his way but it's still the word of God now whatever the Lord started forming this church he knew of course that there would be Seven Ages it would be spread over seven dispensations and there would be seven manifestations of the spirit of God in the Book of Revelation it would be called the seven spirits of God but it would be seven manifestations of the same spirit of God each one of them would be represented by a horn on the Beast and then there would be an eye in the horn now these were actually the horns were the power on the earth which protected the Lamb's rights so in the first church age there was a horn which was under the lion anointing and there was an eye in the horn oh you're trying to get deep brother Donnie no I'm not I just want you to know where you're identified and where every age has been so a horn come up on there and that was the church that was the true Acts 2 church then in that horn was an eye so the eye represented the sear or the dispensation of light that was given to them so he saw seven horns and then he saw seven eyes an eye in each horn so it was the messenger of that age so the eye of the age catches the mind of God looks into the script of God catches the word of the day pulls it down into the horn and then the horn gets under the manifestation of that word you following me of what their word is for their day cuz we didn't know what our word was the Ephesian people didn't know what their word was the Samarian people pergamos saus Sardis Philadelphia and leoda we didn't know what our word was and every Church age message if you notice in the Book of Revelation unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write notice who the letter is addressed to it's not addressed to the denominational headquarters it's not sent to a bunch of Bishops that's going to tell everybody what they can do and cannot do come on church say Amen but who is the letter sent to it is sent to the church M messenger the angel of God of that day he is the eye on the horn so the eye gets the message direct from God then the eye comes right down and projects it down to the horn and then the horn protects the Lamb's rights in that day now we're talking about the bride's rights but also the Lamb of God has rights this is one thing we're called to do we're not called to be passive we're not called to let the world do whatever they want to do and people just say whatever they want to say and let's just s around and hold our peace and and be real quiet Paul didn't believe that Paul and Barnabas did not have no small dissension and disputation with those that was teaching contrary to the word of God they confronted them and said you're not saying the truth well come on now children this is what we are called to do we are called to protect the Lamb's rights in this leot to sin age now everybody in this age one of the most important things to them is what their rights so the gay rights and the you know this rights and that's right well that's fine if that's what they want to do but the Lamb of God also has rights he has a right to have a church he has a right to have a church filled with the Holy Ghost a church built upon the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets is that right and he's not going to send Gabriel down to protect those rights but he's going to have men of God under the same anointing that the eye brought it I don't want to just repeat what brother random said I don't want to just repeat it like a tap recorder but I want to have the same spirit of God he had I want to operate under the same thing that's what I love when he writes it down pick up your pen and write in the spoken words original see that the bride not only has the word but she has the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word it's evident friends a lot of churches and a lot of preachers around this message are missing the mind of Christ notice the seven seal he said whenever the mind of Christ comes in that is the supernatural element so people can come to the message but it does not mean they get the immediate oh my the immediate deposit of the mind of Christ just when you hand them a book if they do not have the mind of Christ they'll never know what God wants done by that word but if you receive the mind of Christ with the message itself then you know what he wants done it's evident some folks still don't know what he wants done they think he wants us to argue and debate and make this little kingdom and that little kingdom that's not what he wants done with the word he wants us as preachers to preach the word and produce word first and Obey them scriptures lay hands on the sick I know some of the preachers in the message they're fighting laying hands on the sick and they say we're Beyond it we don't need it no more I'll guarantee you one thing we've still got a lot of sick folks around here and I'm going to still keep on go brother Donnie brother brandom got to a place he never had no more Visions I want you to show me that in the message I'll tell you when brother brandom stop having visions when he move into the other dimension you want to tell me the prophet stopped praying for people people and the prophet start having prayer line I want you to show me that where he said that himself what did he do he was still ministering to the body right before he left the Earth and that's what every godall man is called to do cast out Devils lay hands on the sick praise the Lord now notice if here in the chapter 15 again verse 5 but there arose up a certain set wow of the Pharisees which believed wow so you mean they still kept their old name on Pharisees that believed I guess my question would be believed what how could you be a believer and still want to be called a Pharisee or a sad you see I think some of y'all are sad you that it was needful to circumcise them how could they believe how could they be word born Christians and still believe you had to be circumcised In the Flesh they had no Revelation that the Holy Ghost was the tool of circumcision in the New Testament they had no idea it was still to do with this right here amen that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses and the apostles and the elders came together for to consider of this matter now notice they did not consider it denominational at all when questions raised up for the preachers to get together and try to resolve some of these issues come on wonder why that's so foreign to us come on now wonder why that's so strange and we're Apostolic are we really I wonder I wonder how many Apostolic churches we actually have in the message we have a lot of message churches but I wonder if they're Apostolic message churches you hear what some of them is preaching you can understand they're a long way from the doctrine of the Apostles verse 22 then pleased it the apostles and Elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas wow so what if we hear there's some kind of Doctrine that's broke out wherever and then some of the brothers get together and say you know what we we all need to go to timbuck two we'll say we need to make a trip to timbuck too and we need to straighten out some of stuff cuz this is going to affect us all boy can you imagine what some of the message people say Lord have mercy brother Donnie and brother Daryl and Brother David S or this brother they're going to 10 Buck too and they told me that they're going over there to straighten out a bunch of stuff who in the world they think they are Lord we're going into denomination that's the way they done they did in the Bible you know what I just realized I'm I'm I might I might be in the wrong church tonight I mean I'm preaching to people that look just like you two weeks ago the last time I preached But now y'all are looking at me like you don't know me come on brother oh my goodness so they send these people now with Paul and Barnabas namely Judas her name barabus and Silas Chief men among the Brethren and they wrote Letters by them after this matter the apostles and elders and Brethren send greetings unto the Brethren which are in the Gentiles and Antioch and Syria and cissa for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us on now they went out from them but they went out without Authority you see this is the way God wanted to control Division and contention I wonder how many them guys when they heard Paul was in town shook like a leaf and the fall winds blowing they said Lord have mercy he's here oh good gracious I didn't realize h why because Paul said you think I've got this attitude they say oh his words are powerful but he's puny as we saying his body he said let him know that these same words I write when I get there I will have the same attitude sir you see that would have kind of helped Squatch down a lot of false Doctrine and a lot of false teachers why is it that all these things are breaking out around the world you know because the greatest most powerful Nation so-called in the world has a weak leader and Satan waits for weakness as Nations wait for weakness now watch for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words so they actually came out from under the apostles and the elders and then they started troubling the people sewing Discord and false Doctrine and whatever more uh with the word subverting your souls subverting subverting your souls and saying that's what it said today oh well you know we really think it's not necessary to no longer quote the prophet well of course we believe the message in secret but you know I I'm kind of thinking that maybe maybe we should start a TV program or something like that not against anybody wants to do all that sort of thing but you know if if we're going to have a TV broadcast and maybe a radio broadcast and we're going to do this and other or maybe we're going to do a lot of Outreach meetings well that's good nothing wrong with that either unless of course you have to compromise What You Preach well since we're going to do that it wouldn't be fitting to you know to mention anything about so I won't say it but you all will understand so from this point on I won't say seventh angel or any preachers that come into our church I'll mention to them and ask them not to read quotes of subverting their souls so you understand what some preachers now begin to do they began to cut off the light they're supposed to filter down into the soul of the horn the body the body is supposed to absorb the light as it comes through the eye and the revelation of the hour it sets their soul on fire by that word but of course if you become ashamed you think it was just a mistake to Paul wrote to Timothy and said don't be ashamed of me as his messenger there must have been something already moving among them what do we have to actually get up and say Paul I mean really he's got a pretty bad record you know this guy was a murderer can you imagine in that day now of course we pick up our Bible today and we read it as a holy word of God but in that day it was simply books or letters written by this man that was so strange and bizarre that he said he was carried up to the third heaven whoever heard of such a thing and he said women couldn't even preach my Lord what in the world's a matter with him and he even wrote In the book of Romans that men were sleeping with men and women sleeping with women and he said those that do it are worthy of damnation and I say the same [Applause] thing I heard some of the guys up in the lodge where we were staying out in the hunting trip talking about a gay Pastor I thought oh my Lord make me sick at my stomach gay Pastor can you imagine can you imagine a man being that blind can you imagine people being so foolish they would set under such when God's word will condemn them oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I must have got a little raise of that light it come down on me and hit me and made me kind of Li you like or something kind of rough let me let me let me cut off that light and say oh how is everybody this is the greatest day of your life oh boy come on now some of you that would feed on that slop that's all it is slop fit for Hogs I want you to notice how that Luke whenever he writes this in chapter 15: 24 it said for as much as we have heard that certain went out from us now you see they were not sent they just went amen it seemed good unto us being assembled with one Accord well that's a miracle within itself ain't it to send chosen men unto you as our beloved Barnabas and Paul men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we have sent therefore Judas not his scar it now Judas and isus who shall also tell you the same things by mouth so now they notice the difference between these men and the others the others went but weren't sent these went but were set the others didn't have a message that coincided with what the apostles was preaching but these were the voices echoing the truth of what the apostles said now they didn't just send Paul and Barnabas but they sent these other brothers who had been around even longer you see friend a lot of the thing that Satan has wanted to do is to try to corrupt us away from this original Apostolic order and it gives him more Liberty to do whatever he wants to do all people have to say is they feel led I challenge any person here any person listen to me tonight around the world I challenge any preacher to show me where the words feel led all right in the book of Acts where any preacher felt led to go do this or do that or the other contrary to God's scripture I'll be waiting but I ain't going to stop preaching till I get it I'm just going to go and preach now notice we have sent ah so you mean the church sent wow hope it's hard for me to say this brother Joel Brown's had a burden on his heart to do something for the community where he was raised up and he come and talk to me about it and want me to pray with him of course he follow the leading of the Lord and God would be with him and wed my advice lesson so it so happens that there's a church not too far from this community where brother Joel was feeling and I told him brother Joel the first thing you need to do of course after praying about it is contact the brother in that area right Joel I said don't you go in there and try to start something different than what he's got said why would you tell him that because I think Bible I think Apostolic that's the way they did you never find them coming in come on children now preach with me you don't find it in the Bible with them going along with men who done something contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles and the prophets so I said go in and let the brother know you're not there trying to undercut him but you've got a burden for your your black Community where you were raised because many of them of course still live in their own community and may not go to some of the white churches yet or whatever more and he just wanted to go see is there somebody there Lord is there somebody there said but brother Joel the thing of it is you don't want to be like brother random brother random went to India and had hard no churches to support him all those people come to God and he said whenever he come back he said probably nearly every one of them went back to the siks the James the Buddhist because there was no church to s send them to so I said go there and talk to that Pastor which brother Joel did so and the brother actually said well you can have our church if you wish to if you want to use it for outreach whatever and I thought praise God that that's that's an awesome way to do it and brother Joel said well maybe not maybe we just you know get a building and I tell them I said where you going to have it I said I hadn't thought about that said well you going to use for PA well I hadn't thought about that well you see whenever you've got men that are experienced and you're going to start a work work it's foolish so foolish not to ask the men of God who's been laboring for decades it shows scriptural ignorance in the minds of so many people as I said I wonder how many Apostolic message churches we have thank you Jesus y'all want me to go on another hunting trip this week is any place say we can go brother Danel notice now in verse in verse 40 and Paul chose Silas and departed because he felt led and he felt led and and uh Silas felt led Paul CH Silas and departed so do you understand what would happen in that day if a man would feel lad to go out and start a church or do whatever and they would go to the local church and say hey he come talk to you are you all working with this is this a work together with you and if they would have said no real Apostolic Believers would had nothing to do with it right come on message people will read your Bible now remember from this night forward every one of you is going to be held accountable and you will stand before the Lord God himself and these scriptures right here that you've seen on this screen will be on Heaven's screen yeah not only you visible but those of you that are streaming and if I'm taken from the earth and people go back and archive it them too cuz this is God's word not mine and he went through Syria and Sicilia confirming the churches chapter 16:4 and as they went through the cities they delivered them the oh no decrees I mean y'all still believe your Bible 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of who ordained of the Apostles and Elders which were at Jerusalem wow verse five and so oh so here's the way New Testament churches expanded and started and so were the church is established notice and how many faiths Presbyterian Faith Church of Christ Faith Church of God faith one God faith two God faith three God faith there was one Faith well there's truly still is just one true faith can I go a bit farther thank you chapter 20 verse 17 and from myus he sent to Ephesus now this is Paul as he's journeying through he sent to Ephesus and he called the Elders of the church wow so you mean the prophet of the age is going through an area and he would not even pass through that area Harry until he called the Elders of the church and wanted to meet with them chapter 21: 18 and the day following Paul went in with us into James and all the elders were present and when he saluted them he declared particularly what things God had WR among the Gentiles by his ministry 1 Corinthians 4:17 for this cause have I sent unto you osthus you mean Paul sent another preacher okay now some of y'all buckle up okay put your shoulder harness on your seat belt your crash helmet and everything before brother Ron Spencer ever started pastoring I sent him on a mission get your handkerchief out and wave it by that person by You Phantom phanom you don't believe me ask him as a matter of fact we was talking about long ago he said you remember when you sent me to certain certain place I said yes sir I remember that brother Jim bab went with him they had some Great Fellowship until they started talking about the different football teams that they liked and then they nearly had a fallen out it didn't last long now can you imagine brother Ron Spencer being able to be sent somewhere come on now well glory to God it's either getting awful hot in here or I'm feeling the pressure notice and when he saluted them he declared particularly what things God had wrote among him among the Gentiles now he jumps over here First Corinthians speaking about now what he do have i s unto you timotheus who is my beloved Son and faithful in the Lord and shall bring into you remembrance of my ways which be in Christ as I have taught everywhere in every Church wow you mean to tell me that Timothy then whenever he would go in and preach the message and he would actually preach about the messenger and talk about the messenger to the people and say now I want to remind you now brother Paul you remember how he lived now brother Paul you remember you imagine people say now what in the world is he doing referring to some man what in the world is he doing talking about some man oh my good people say I cannot believe you all stand up and quote a man well what's the difference between us quoting the Vindicated prophet and you quoting the smiley preacher from t what's the differ that El standing up here preaching and you quoting the 700 Club or The 500 Club or the 200 Club you're going to quote somebody I'm just GL I'm quoting the right body amen I'm not ashamed of this message know of this [Applause] messeng 2 Corinthians 8:16 but thanks be to God which put the same Earnest care Into the Heart of Titus for you for for indeed he accepted the exhortation being more forward of his own court and he went unto you we have sent with him the brother my goodness so you mean men of God actually felt they could influence others and they would go because these men of God hey why don't some of you Brothers go down to a jail over there why don't you do this what you want to do something for the Lord some young preachers want to preach and where a lot of them want to start out preaching before 500 yeah they want to stand up so why don't you go to the nursing home oh no no no I'm too nervous to go over a nursing home if God's called you you'll start in a hog lot if that's where you have to start if you've got to start down out with one woman Jesus wasn't too big to go to one woman anytime a preacher is too big to go to one woman he's too big for his britches amen if you're a called of God you'll preach in a pig lot you'll preach wherever God sent you because it's burning inside of your soul you ain't preaching for an offering you ain't preaching for a crowd you're preaching because God himself called you to do it now can you imagine if brother Joel Brown moved on his heart whenever they start having Services maybe he's already started having some and the brother from that area would call me and say Hey brother Donnie brother Joel Brown from your church is coming up here and he's doing this this or this you know anything about it and brother Joel didn't think it necessary of course to come to me and I would have to say no sir I don't I don't know one thing about it so I don't know exactly what verse said he might use but more than likely Sunday brother Joel is going to be his text why cuz he don't know brother Joel he want alpam under the headship of his pastor [Music] but now if the brother's concerned and he ain't call me cuz he trusts him you imagine when say oh yeah done talk to Brother D okay that's good that's exactly right oh you say that's a denominational that's the Bible that's God's protocol but again friends people don't believe what the prophet told they do not believe what he said that God called ministers are God's commanding officers they simply don't believe it and do you realize your unbelief will keep you out of the Rapture you think it matters to God which scripture you disbelieve whether it's Malachi 4 or Ephesians 4 I want to believe all of them don't you brother amen boy it seems like I've been preaching for three days is it that long man a lot God help me tomorrow notice we have sent him the brother whose praises and the gospel throughout all the churches not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this Grace what a recommendation so the churches was in such Unison they said brother Paul We believe this young brother he'd be a blessing to you and a help to you and a strength to you so it wasn't just I feel L I feel L I feel L I feel L but the church has recommended this brother and Paul so honored the way the churches felt about it he said I believe I'll take him with us all these scriptures of will be available for you if you'd like to read them yourself this is not a king Donnie version It's the King James that's right I'm sorry y'all didn't know this is in your Bible maybe you'd spend more time reading your Bible instead of on Facebook and Tik Tok and twick twack and everything else in the world and social media spend a little time in Social mediating with God you might know your Bible a little better Philippians 2:25 yet I suppose it necessary to send to you aphroditus and companion and labor and fellow Soldier but your messenger he that ministered to my wants for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness don't you understand what this did this eliminated so much false [Music] prophets they would not let them in their pulpit without [Music] recommendation for he longed after you all and was full of Heaven is because that he had heard that ye had heard he had been sick for indeed he was sick and N to death but God had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also amen won't you look at this prophet of the age he needed men around him that had inferior Ministries and he did not feel threatened he needed men that could come he knew he wasn't going to live forever he knew in order for the message to live there had to be other men of God that would pack that same message oh I heard brother man said today things that ought to be and he's preaching that last message I if you knew it or not but that Assembly of God and he said I know I'm I know I'll go on I oil pass something like that and he said go on and these young men I used to fulfill that scripture not anymore since I'm an old man but these young men will take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord Jesus tape players don't have legs Church come on MP3 players don't have legs Shaman don't have legs a tape player can't baptize you a tape player cannot sit there and cons so you God call men is what God ordained to pack this word he's never changed it and that's what we believe because we are original Apostolic [Applause] Believers praise God can you imagine what this recommendation meant now for a pafitis to the church I send him therefore the more carefully that when you see him again you may Rejoice that I may be the less sorrowful receive him therefore so what about hus fius and some of those others that he wrote their name in the Bible now they too were preachers but they were preachers without a recommendation oh my they were preachers that Paul warned the flock about now no doubt there some dumb sheep that went and hurt him just out of curiosity but if they really believed this man was a servant of God you imagine ever darking in a door where amus was preaching or felius was preaching and Paul said their Doctrine does eat like a canker which is cancer and a corruption that starts in on the body and the skin begins to die word used for a couple different medical terms there and Paul would liken their Doctrine and their preaching to the rottening of the Flesh and the limbs would fall off ain't a saying of God full of the Holy Ghost going to sit and hear amanus preaching nothing why wasn't recommended by the church receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and hold such and reputation fimon 1 ver10 I beseech you beseech thee for my son onesimus whom I have begotten in my bonds which in time past was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me whom I have sent again thou therefore receive him wow so if some other man raises up glory to God I'll tell you one thing I believe the word too hallelujah amen thank you Jesus and Paul didn't recommend him so it show up at Corinth or show up wherever wonder what them people would think and where where's your recommendation oh Lord to God I don't need no recommend Hallelujah I feel that oh [Music] my friend should not believe some of the trash and the nonsense that's going on around our message people with some of their so-called gifts prophesying for this man to leave his wife and marry this man's wife and someone sometime ago a woman standing up and speaking in tongues and interpreting or prophesying or whatever you want to call it I've got a different name for it yeah the Lord I'm calling for a trim I'm calling for a trim so the sisters of the church went home and got their scissors and they started trimming well that's what the Lord said he wanted not my God beels above the devil well come on now well Hallelujah how do we judge prophecy oh I felt it we don't judge it by feeling we judge it by the word and if it don't come to pass it ain't the Lord hallelujah hallelujah oh my notice in Jude chapter one only one chapter of course verse 17 but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before of the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ notice how now Jude is the Foster brother brother of the Lord Jesus notice how Jude is exhorting the people to Remember The Words which were spoken by the Apostle as if though it was the holy word of God wow how many believes the apostles Doctrine is important yes sir brother how many be honest and say well to be honest with you I'm not sure how much of the message churches even go with that anymore I'll raise my hands whether you got enough courage to or not I can guarantee you it's so sad when you look at it oh my brother Donnie we're in the age of the Prophet The Apostles don't even matter no more really well Jesus certainly disagrees with you that's right because he built his City in heaven in a reflection of the earth Revelation 21:14 and the wall of the city had 12 foundations and in them the names of the 12 Apostles of the Lamb yes so you mean when you get there and you're going to live in that City for eternity you're going to see them 12 names of them Apostles now you see the Lord Jesus want he said brother brandom did not go in there and tire at TH Foundation say now wait a minute I made a mistake here I shouldn't have never built the city on the foundation of the Apostles I should have just buil on brother Bram alone and have brother Ram's name there he makes no mistakes so what did Brother Brandon be built upon the doctrine and the teaching of the Apostles and Jesus Christ was so confident that he could build the church on it that he himself allowed himself to be the first stone laid on that foundation and then you and I are given the privilege to be laid by him on that same Foundation that's right let's stand praise the Lord and the church said how many wants our church to be a Bible believing Apostolic Church not UPC not Church of God in Christ not any of these other denominational things but a Bible believing Church oh my hallelujah thank you Father thank you Father you see in reality friends a man a preacher which cannot be led and cannot recognize headship himself is not a leader he is a dictator you look at the difference between Saul and David Saul could not be corrected Saul could not admit he was wrong he couldn't follow directions so therefore he could not be LED under the teachings of the prophet Samuel and look he becomes so stubborn so hard-headed he didn't want to be told what to do oh yeah God said this I've done what God Said but look at David boy he had his mistakes didn't he but he knew how to repent amen and he could do it not because of act but because he genuinely meant it that's right he could be led to repentance he could be led to saying he was wrong he could be led and God even hundreds of years later God was still referring back to David and he said for my servant David's sake for my servant David's sake hundreds of years after he was gone but his legacy meant so much to God oh may God help us we can be that kind of Christians let's bow our heads if you would praise the Lord now maybe you're here tonight and you say actually brother Donnie I didn't realize the Bible said all that well you probably didn't because you're not called to study the word like a preacher would and God knows that so maybe you didn't understand maybe you didn't see it maybe you didn't know it was there but after tonight you say my I want to be that kind of believer I want my heart my life my home our church to be established upon the doctrine the teaching of the Apostles that original word because I truly believe God sent his Prophet to restore our hearts back to the apostolic fathers that's right the apostolic fathers praise God how many wants our church to be that kind of a church would you just raise your hand before God and the angels are watching you the Lord Jesus is watching you and demons are watching so remember we're making our stand we want to be a Bible believing Church oh yeah a message sure oh absolutely with all of our hearts yes we want to believe it teach it walk it obey it praise the Lord heavenly father as we lift our hands to you tonight dear God in your presence I thank you Lord for the Bible I realize Lord Jesus some of our brothers and sisters still in parts of Africa India different parts of the world still don't have a personal Bible I've seen some pictures of some just a few days ago getting their own Bible for the first time we have them laying in our cars laying in our homes we have access to them all of us that have a smartphone have access to them and how much do we read them how I thank you for the Bible and Lord how we thank you tonight for the message of the hour amen that points us right back to the Bible the devil tried to lay a trap for your Prophet one day a man come to the prophet and said now now brother brandham you've had so much experience with God so many visions and so on you would be qualified to write your own Bible now he said the man i' have been trying to catch me a little and I said well brother that might be so but that couldn't be what God would want because he said there would be NE added to this word I remember brother Charlie Cox telling me one time that when brother brandham was there at their house and brother Char had been reading a message book and he had his Bible laying there on a table and he had just laid that message book over on top of the Bible brother brandham saw it went over and picked it up and laid the Bible on top of the message book said brother Charlie don't ever put anything before the word of God Lord God I pray our people will always believe that I pray your people around the world will always have that attitude to love the word to love their scriptures to read them oh Jesus we love you father we don't want to just baptize in your name say we're Apostolic we're one God but we want to be able to take the founding of a new church or the advancing of the kingdom of God brothers that would go out of our assembly I don't believe you call preachers just to set them all under a preacher the rest of their life but they may be sitting there for years to get training so they can be able to go out maybe start other works or missionary or whatever more more but Lord if they follow the apostolic pattern they will not have to sneak around behind the pastor's back like a snake in the grass thank you Lord cuz if they would have done that in the days of Paul they would have got no recommendation help us father What a Sad thing it is many churches will crumble because they aren't built on the revelation of your word I didn't start this church Lord it was started years ago on rone Hill I thank you for those who started it Lord Lord the Yan's family and the Phillips family and many of them dear God their parents and grandparents and we thank you for them they were the Pioneers that started it then move moved it over to Happy Valley and Lord they changed the name of it when it moved from Ron Hill to Happy Valley because they didn't figure that Ron Hill would quite fit the name anymore with them being at Happy Valley sort of the way I looked at it whenever we left Happy Valley I didn't figure it'd be fitting since we're sitting in Buffalo Valley to call it happy valley so I figured it's time for a change Lord God just because we change the name of the church don't mean we change what we stand for as a matter of fact I'm more determined now to disrupt the kingdom of Hell than I've ever been in my life hallelujah hallelujah we're more determined dear God to stand for your gospel stand for your truths cast out Devils heal the sick I'm more determined dear God to pray for the sick people people I'm more determined to pray for folks with cancer than I've ever been in my entire life I am by no means discouraged I am by no means down or weary Satan thought he would get my face but he better thinkink again he thought he would discourage us but he better think again we are not discouraged we are encouraged we are encouraged in the word we're encouraged in Your Great Name in your great power father we're looking for great things to happen among us we've seen great things but we are looking for greater and by greater I don't necessarily mean more emotion I mean a greater manifestation of your person and when I say greater I don't mean dead a lot of folks consider greater with dead I don't think it's going to be dead I don't think we're going to stop worshiping we ain't going to stop praising we ain't going to stop singing we're not going to stop clapping our hands I think we ought to have a shout we ought to have the shout of the king among us now more than ever before because your word is manifesting itself amen Lord God prove yourself Among Us Jesus we've already seen you heal cancer we saw sister Ruth Garden Lord I believe with all of my heart here several months ago she lay there dear God lifeless but after prayer the spirit of God brought our sister back we've seen you do so many things among us already Lord God that only fertilizes our faith to believe you've got wonderful things if we can only stay small and stay humble Lord God help us I pray amen thank you Father how many wants that with all your heart amen friends let me show you the difference difference between some of the arrogance that goes around some of the message preachers I a god taken me to hunt this week and I almost missed the deer that the Lord give me because the guide hadn't called me and I thought well it's too late for me to go brother Daniel called anyway Fally worked it out where I could this guy I get in his truck and he's getting there maybe had even went a mile we've talked about the Lord he's a saved man been a Sunday school teacher youth leader things like that about 64 years old and he said D already told me said my my son's a pastor 32 years old and he said I can tell from talking to you you're a man of God your experience and handling the word what advice would you give to my son I thought as as I sat there m Jo my heart's I I I I was so sad because I thought of the message preachers that could ask their Elders similar things but won't even do it won't even come to Men of God that have labored in the word and already forgotten more than some of them will ever even know and won't even humble thems to come the Servants of God and say help me man of God I've got a burden on my heart to do this to do that do you see anything wrong with it do you see anything wrong in my Ministry look at me servant of God pray with me help me advise me yeah and I thought how sad I'm not sure if he was a Baptist or Methodist whatever but all I know is we talked about the Lord and hugged one another's neck and shed tears I thought how pitiful that a man like this that knows nothing about the message of Malachi 4 and yet but have more humility about him don't even know what I believe and some of the message people that have watched you for years and years yeah what'd you tell him brother Donnie I said my advice to him would be this stay humble stay little don't never become big in his own eyes and become arrogant and proud and I said if he will stay that way God will be able to use him he said 'w he's always been humbled and got a real good spirit I said that's great but I said tell him that I said to keep it because Solomon the man of God that built the Great temple of God when he got older he also built this Temple and that Temple and another Temple and another Temple for idol worship the very same man that built the house of God because he got arrogant and proud God God's blessed us and give us a nice place to worship don't we thank him for it than Lord but let's not get arrogant let's not get proud and say boy our church is Big our church is our church let's stay small and little and see what he'll do let's not ask people come and see our church let's tell them come and see our Jesus yeah amen amen come and see our Jesus don't come and see our pastor come and see our youth choir Bo I tell you why sister Emma is doing such a great job with our young people and our boy you ought to see our youth group my goodness brother Rob and brother Joe and this brother oh just just come and see our youth group let's tell them to come and see our Jesus are youth leaders can't change your heart I can't change their hearts only Jesus can change our hearts amen hallelujah sing something for us s praise the Lord you imagine what brother Brandon would be able to say tonight if he'd walk in this church and say my those of you that have been to brandham Tabernacle you know how small that it is how humble how little brother brandham wanted to build a bigger church but the people didn't want to and one of the brothers that was on the board said that after the people voted not to do it brother brandham told them that's what they think of my Ministry but because the church voted to do so he stayed right there but I've often wondered what it would have been if they would have been of the right mind you see a Visionary is always one of the most misunderstood preachers that there is in the ministry because most everybody just wants to keep his scrunch down don't grow don't do this don't do that oh no oh no it's our for and no more but the Visionary that says what about tomorrow if there is another 10 years or 5 years what will we do what are we going to do with our young people what are we going to give to them oh my we don't want to just give them a nice building we don't want to give you a place to play basketball we want to give you a place where you can be born again but I also want to give you a place where you can come together with your own and we can invite the youth from North Carolina South Carolina Georgia it's absolutely amazing the youth services that we've had I'm hearing from pastors I'm hearing from youth churches or youth leaders rather some of these other churches when I was here when brother Matt was here how many of the youth from South Carolina North Carolina Georgia sit outside and say thank you brother Donnie for letting us come praise God so you see this ain't just for us this ain't just for us hallelujah and it won't be if we'll stay little and stay small how many wants to be that way oh Jesus we love you Lord Jesus Use Me Jesus use me let's sing it together before we go I'm sorry I have you a little bit long tonight we say Brother Don but I'm not a preacher and I I've never even spoken tongues I don't get up on the floor and dance and I understand my little daughter that just stepped be on the curtain of time I never recall ever hearing her speaking tongues I seen her one time on a video where she was jumping can't recall that I ever saw her shout her higher down I can't recall that I ever saw her cast out a devil or do things that people think is great but I have never seen a lay member whose life touched so many people from around the world I just keep hearing about and I say Lord have mercy Lord have mercy you see the Lord told me months and months ago that we was going to see his glory and he told me that it would be marvelous in our eyes but I totally misunderstood what he meant I just knew beyond a shadow of a doubt and our dedication Services when all the saints of God was praying and Saints from around the world were praying I just knew I just knew beyond a sh of doubt she's going to jump out of that wheelchair and run over this whole place and we was going to tear this church down and have to build another one we all shouted it down but that wasn't what he me at all so you see sisters even you can be great just live your life for what the Lord wants you to be your brothers that'll never preach you never know who you're affected but brother Donnie everybody may not know me the way they do sister cuz she was your daughter I know that but what if you influence one soul and they come to the Lord Jesus Christ and the prophet said that name that individual will be identified with you for eternity forever each of of you have a work for God do it do it let's sing it together come we just worship a little while we go dear I be your witness if you will help my weakness help me Jesus I know that I'm worthy Lord for the oh sing it to him now with all your heart by eyes face I [Applause] see upon upon the cross of

they found a a growth and she can't even get in to get a a second MRI with contrast up until January so she's having these things multiple times during the day and it's sort of like that she passes

restful sleep some people gets when they come to church feel like his daddy let's bow our heads together heavenly father have we thank you Lord Jesus thank you for the great gift of Life yes Lord thank you often think when I take these little children my arms and look down into their face how you must have felt that day when you made your first son you didn't make him a baby but a full-grown man it must have thrilled you when you sell the first of your own kind how when a mother and father bring their little child son or daughter to give it to you and they look at each other through their Union and the product of that Union and that little baby maybe a mother's nose a Daddy's Eyes fingers toes they can see that reflected through that Union dear God then they know the greatest thing they can do is bring it back to you father we're just praying today that you would be with our brother and sister and helps them with the great awesome responsibility of not only giv a child life but bringing it up in a way that'll please you was truly it takes you to help us Lord he didn't come with a manual or how-to book but Lord Jesus you gave us one it's called your word yes Lord I pray you'd help my brother Mark father may his little son be able to hear him pray and hear him sing and talk about Jesus May him he be able to hear his mother The Fifth Gospel yes Lord be able to instill in the great things of God well truly if we can bring them up in the right way that's pleasing to you this is the shortest time we'll ever have them so beyond the curtain of time they will be with their offspring forever yes Lord dear God we bring him to you today who dedicate his little life to you I ask you father you keep him from the evils of the day if time would ter that he come to the age of accountability Lord Jesus deal with his heart while he's young and tender May the presence of God be with him we commit him to you today Father in the name of the Lord Jesus amen yeah dodo Grandpa Stand Together what a privilege it is for us to be gathered together again today in the house of the Lord let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 11 if you would today I'm as happy to be a Christian happy to be given the opportunity to be able to serve the Lord in this day and all the things that he's done in this hour that we live 1 Corinthians 11:34 if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come 1 Corinthians 1440 let all things be done decently and in order the word order is taxi and arranging Arrangement a fixed succession observing a fixed time do or write order orderly condition now this type of biblical order is not formalism it's just the way God wants things done so it's a post a rank or a position which one holds in Civic or other Affairs since this position generally depends on one's talents you'll find the prophet saying the same thing question answers 1961 he said I like to look and see what a person is professing God has called them to do because generally Works God works with his creature the way that he has made him so if a man claims he's called to preach watch how he interprets the word he says that'll let you know if God's already called him or not so this position generally depends on one's talents experiences resources character fashion quality and style Colossians chapter 2 verse 5 for though I be absent in the flesh yet am I with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order so Paul is not rebuking them for having the right kind of order for ISM now of course spirit of God rebukes that but this is the type of order that God wants so it actually made Paul so happy and he said even though he was not there but he was hearing through the reports back from the church at colossia what they were doing and they said um Bishops and all that sort of thing up in the church and they had deacons and people of position and Paul heard back and he said I'm not there but I'm with you in spirit and I'm joying and beholding your your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ I mean let to be remembered today as we pray God bless you Heavenly Father we're so grateful that we could be gathered together once again here today Lord in this building that you've given us dear Jesus we've seen you do so many awesome things in our in our midst and for that we will forever be grateful but as needy human beings we come again today we have different needs different desires petitions you saw the hands that were uplifted maybe a marital problem maybe a financial issue maybe a son or daughter away from God I pray whatever that request is that you'd be mindful of them Lord father we're asking you today also for those that are sick and needy some in our assembly fighting tremendous battles with their health they need Miracles father and Lord we're mindful also and thankful that you brought our brother Larry Elliott through his surgery was able to come home and recuperating and we're just praying for our brother that you'd continue to strengthen and be with him help me now Lord as I Endeavor to speak on the words of Life take the service take the word help me Lord Jesus help the people for it's the glory of God and the kingdom which is to come that we ask these things in Jesus Christ Christ name amen God bless you you may be seated I want to speak to you again today by the help of the Lord on the right to be in divine order the right to be in divine order uh I'd like to go if we can back to when the prophet was out west and him and some of the brothers were on a hunting trip and he looked looked up into the Stars into the sky and he began to relate what he saw and I said somewhere in there I had it pointed out to me one time in an observatory the Zodiac beginning with the Virgin coming over through the cancer age on down to the last was the lion Leo the Lion the first coming of Christ by the Virgin the second coming by the lion of the tribe of Judah I've tried my best to see that zodiac and I can't see it yet notice now it's there those who are trained know it's there job saw it man used to look at it it was a Bible one day it was a Bible one day but in that whole great mass of millions and billions of light years God sits in the the midst of it all and he looks down Paul is in there my mother is in there somewhere looking down and I thought of the order of the Heavenly Host not one of them's out of place every one of them keeps its time perfectly God's Great Army so he looking at the stars and of course at that time man couldn't not see where he's able to see now because of the equipment that they had in 1962 and it's like it's exploded um in this last day of what man has been able to see beyond what he could see at that time and it no doubt it would be overwhelming for the scientists in 1962 to be able to come back today and look through an observatory and see what scientist see now when they didn't even have the terminology that men use today they never use the word Parasect they never use certain terms the scientists have to use today to Define what they have seen and I Marvel at that myself because I find it amazing that science has been able to grow so much and understand so much more and yet when it comes to religion and church some people are still talking the same thing they talked for decades and hundreds of years ago they've not grown any in God their understanding is not grown they're exactly where their grandfathers were where their great-grandfathers were but aren't you glad God has allowed a people on the Earth in the last day to also grow with the time now when brother brandham looked up it must have been a great thing now remember a prophet sees things quite different than any the rest of us sees it so for him to call the Stars a great Army I mean know brother brand was not in the sense of a Hebrew scholar or a Greek scholar he uses several words down through the the years of the message but and he would take a Greek Lexicon but he was not one to use a lot of the Greek words and the Hebrew words so whether he ever even looked it up to be able to see what God said about the word host in the Old Testament which means an army I don't really know but yet he identified what he saw as an army of God and he saw them in a divine order and he believed according to what he saw that every one of them had a certain pass and if they stayed in that pass it would work exactly right but then he was puzzled and you can watch him as he talks about the earth and the the moon and all how it comes through and we'll jump down to paragraph three and I thought about that being God's Great Army there and I went to bed and I began to think that not one of those get out of their place they all set in place and if there's a moving anywhere of them for a cause it will affect the Earth we just seen the results of it now from some of them moving into other spots it's effective it affects everything and I thought then if that Gra heavenly host that has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order it throws the whole s out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit now notice he says the order of the spirit so the spirit of God has an order and that order is not formality that order is not dead and dry but it is a way by which God moves now according to Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the Heaven in that particular spot Moses does not use the plural form but God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and he called The Darkness night now the Earth is in the heavens too is it not but isn't it amazing that God separated the Earth out of the heavens and gave it its own special place in the heavens so it sort of reminds me of the people of God that we are in the world but we are not of the world so the Earth was identified in the heavens but yet called out from the heavens and given a special place if you wish to say it this way the Earth was Sanctified to the Lord God for a special purpose out of all the rest of the planets and the stars and as I quoted to you a couple of weeks ago that in the observable universe that there is estimated to be one septian Stars several trillion galaxies in those galaxies can be millions of stars and yet none of them does the bible call their name not another planet does the bible Call It by name you see when God calls something or someone by name and sanctifies them to himself it is a special choice voice and a reason that God is doing it now watch God now wrote this in the stars and God before he ever used the word election predestination choosing God wrote it in Stardust so God wrote The Mystery of predestination in the Stars God wrote that there would be a bride one day that would be separate from from all the rest of the church he wrote it in the Stars God called the Earth by name and wrote that in the stars that there would be a planet above all the rest and as we looked at it last Sunday that one little blue dot in the mass of all the universe and yet one spot that God chose to be in what scientists call the habitable zone so if the Earth was so much so many thousand miles closer to the Sun it would be too hot for life to grow if it was very much farther out away from the Sun it would be too cold for life to be able to survive so God placed it exactly in what they term as the habitable zone well you see that's the way it is with people some people no matter how much you and I pray for them how much we want them to be bride we will never even by prayer and fasting be able to make anyone bride only God can do that and if God never ordained that their life be in the spiritual habitable zone They will never be able to bring forth bride seed they may be good people they may go to church and they may wind up being saved as we would say but will never wind up being elect man is so interested in being able to get out there it's reading one day this week where Elon Musk is wanting to make a habitable place on Mars already planning it out with all the different things that they're doing and they want to make this community in Mars and I saw you know that that's the the the Mind of Men we've got thousands and thousands of acres in Texas in Arizona in Utah in Nevada in all types of places that aren't even habited by a human being now and yet instead of trying to figure out how to be able to bring water and this and that and the other on our own Planet they're trying to reach out yonder somewhere and put a community on Mars ain't nobody belongs on Mars but martians if there was such a thing but you see it's like man always wants to look beyond what God gives him so instead of being satisfied that God gave the Earth according to the Book of Psalms God gave the Earth to man not Mars not Saturn I don't care what they do they'll never find another planet that is special like the earth I don't care what the church does I don't care how much they despise the messenger and the message they will never replace the end time message in the last day they're looking for it here and they're looking for it there they can look all they want to look God chose Malachi 4 and Malachi 4 is the way he will do it is that right now that's God's choice but yet there's something in man that he's got to go beyond where God put him and find for something you imagine how many billions of dollars are wasting how much that they are wasting and people living their life for an absolute fruitless cause of something that will never materialize because the Bible says God gave the Earth to man so why shouldn't man just be happy where God put him you know it's the same way when we look at the spiritual reflection in the word that we've got people always no matter in every message that God sent to the Earth that there was an element of people that could never be satisfied living in the boundaries of the revealed word of their hour they constantly had to look and search for something new something different something that was just a little bit beyond what the messenger of their age said I hope somebody's sharing this morning and we find the same thing going on around the ranks of our message preachers always looking for just a little bit more than what God's Prophet said well he didn't exactly say it that way but he should have well he didn't exactly put it this way but if he would be here now he would say it this way well you know sounds like a martian to me somebody that's trying to move out of the designated area that God gave us as his people I said it years ago and I believe it's the same way if the Bible don't say it and the message don't speak it Heaven don't require it well come on somebody I don't care how many dreams and Revelations and visions that people have if it ain't in the word of God for the hour I personally don't have time for it and the church said you see the Earth is a part of the Heavens but Sanctified now look what does God give a man a wife for and whenever the Jews would get married in the Old Testament s of the Orthodox of this day they will say something like this I sanctify thee be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel so a woman then that would join up to a husband the husband takes that set aart woman and by setting herself apart from the rest of the world which means she'll have no more lovers no more boyfriends nothing like that she's Sanctified to this one man in this sanctification is what makes her joining or her Union to her husband and it comes from the man's mouth be thou th Sanctified unto me now this is what God has done in every age by the message of the hour that he's called to the elect and said to the elect be thou Sanctified unto me set apart from me don't dress like them don't act like them don't do the way they do but be thou Sanctified unto me and the elect of every age have done exactly that now the Earth could not make herself habitable how could the Earth be able when God the logos spun it off in the beginning and he Let It Drop for so many millions of miles and God designated the decreed path for the Earth how could the Earth do that herself how could the Earth pick out that I want to be in the certain spot in the solar system and I want to be there I want to be there the Earth couldn't do that it was decreed by the almighty God no more than you and I can make ourself any more than the Divine allocation of God God has given to us and would make our lives so much easier if we would just find what God's called us to be get in that spot work in that spot and stay in that spot for the rest of our life but there's always something about man and his curious nature that he wants to move Beyond because with a lot of people it's like they feel like they've got so many more talents and so many more gifts oh if they could just move Beyond this or that or the other and you know it as well as I do a lot of times that's nothing but the devil now as God then wrote The Mystery of the Bible up in the Stars before he put it on parchment then we can see in there that there's certain ones that are chosen to be in certain things I like the constellations remember when you look up and one night last week was supposed to been one of the clearest nights and it was absolutely a beautiful night and Carol and I was out after dark and we was able to look up into the Stars absolutely incredible and I told her I said think of it these are the same stars that Adam saw exact same constellation that Moses saw when he was here the very same ones that Joshua saw the very same ones that the Lord Jesus when he looked up and he looked up at his handiwork when he was here and not one of them has moved a million miles you know when you look into the belt of Orion or you look into the stars and you see that there's a Nova Supernova that's down inside of there and the light the from there thousands of years ago that's coming to the Earth and it was the exact same one that was there when Caligula was the emperor of Rome when Nero was there as the emperor of Rome they looked up and saw that same thing and it was written there in the stars and God wrote that mystery himself so we can learn by it can we not so God chose them and yet it's not like one night you look at and there was a star that was was in the belt of a ran or the sword that hangs down on the side and then the next night you look at it it decided it don't want to be there no more it's of been in the belt so it moves over in tarus which is the sign of the bull and then the next night you look over and it winds up being in Leo the Lion no it's only people that do that come on church it's people that get tired of doing this and then they'll move around in the spiritual constellation of God that's why we need to pray about where we go to church church is not like picking out a grocery store and remember once you find that spot where God wants you the devil will do everything he can to move you from that God ordained place because if he can move the man in the home out of the will of God it can throw the entire home out of the divine order of God and you men will be responsible for that just keep that in mind and it's the same way with a pastor of a church or a preacher if God can be able to call a man and gift a man giving them element of influence and then cause that man to get out of the divine order of God and then maybe affect hundreds of people and that man will be responsible for it is that right so you look that unlike the Stars which are ordained then they've got a certain past and no doubt there's an element of variance that's made in their past because we know even the moon itself being an average of What 293 M th000 miles something like that from the Earth to Sun being an average of 93 million miles and you know how it is that the sun can be brighter in the fall and the winter it'll about blind you if you're driving toward the East and the morning or toward the west in the evening is that right and it's actually closer to the Earth in the winter time by proximity be but because it tilts on its axis the Rays and stuff is further away and yet when you look at it God knew that the Earth in the beginning made it to stand up like this after the fall the Earth felt with it so the Earth felt to a tilt but God made it knowing that it would happen so there's an element of our life that the variables of degrees by which we have the perfect will of God and then we have the permissive will of God and all how each of us should seek and desire and hunger for that perfect will of God in our lives and the church said I personally don't desire do not want absolutely not the permissive will of God in my life I want the perfect will of God now watch let's look at Israel whenever God brings the Stars down on the earth and they begin to mirror the same thing because remember God told Abraham to look at the stars and then he told him to to look at the sand and then God tied the dust to the stars and the stars to the dust so he said so shall thy seed be on the earth so God and most even most people that don't believe in predestination we believe that Israel was the chosen people of God we believe that do or not so a lot of people that do not believe in predestination in the New Testament we believe that God chose Israel in the Old Testament I remember when the Bible was coming in the Old Testament God was mirroring what he was going to do after his deaths on the cross what's this in Exodus 19:3 and Moses went up to God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say unto the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear you on Eagle wings and brought you unto myself now what's what God is doing God is reminding Israel of their Exodus and what was their Exodus out of Egypt on an eagle's wings I many knows what that eagle's name was Moses now God used a prophet to call Israel out of Egypt and yet we know that were the Flesh of the Egyptian just the same as Israel's flesh yes as far as flesh it was but they were given a Divine promise of God they never chose God God chose them is that true and what did God do to cause this great Exodus he sent a prophet with a message now notice you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now God is going to separate Israel not only out of the land of Egypt but event you bring them to the land that was promised to their fathers and once they get there he is going to call them out from among all the rest of the nations of the earth he wants them to dress different you know God designated that so that whenever a Jew no matter if he was in Cyprus if he was in among the sirenians wherever the man was that they would be able to look at that man and know that man or that woman was a Jew because of the the way they dressed they would sit down and eat with them they would know that was a Jew why because of the dietary laws so they would see them pray they would see them as they would plant their Gardens and they would know that family was a Jewish family because a Jewish family was not allowed to seow diverse kinds of seed in their rows that have to have a single row of corn single row of peas single row of maters single row of ters and whatever more they knew that was a Jew because they could look at their garments and see there was not a mixture of wool and flax or Linen in the same garment now why would God do this because God is a god of Separation so by their language and they would have what was called a riband r i BB a n d a riband of blue on the bottom of their garment they would know they were Jewish so there was so many things about them that they could look and see why would God do that so people would ridicule them and make fun of them God wanted them separated to himself but can't you see how lead deia wants to be they want to claim the power of the Cross they want to claim Heaven they want to claim that they're going in the Rapture and the body change but they want to look like the world talk like the world act like the world come on somebody they don't want to be separated they don't want to be different they don't want to stand out from the world God's people have always stood out from the world I'm glad he's got some that still do today how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a pecul wow pecul treasure A peculiar treasure look at the word peculiar it means possession valued property peculiar treasure so peculiar treasure is a costly possession acquired with exertion and carefully guarded carefully reserved as the richest treasure among men even as The Treasure of princes consisting of gold and silver precious stones pearls and jewels now notice they did not choose God to be the pecul hey God we we want to be your peculiar people we desire to be your peculiar treasure notice where this is placed he chose them well let me just remind you today Word of Life you never Co chose God God chose you so in reality what I made up my mind I'm quitting uh your choice don't really matter Hallelujah God ain't leaving it up to me God ain't leaving it up to you he chose as himself now watch God said if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine now once again the mirror is taking place to where the stars the path of the stars is being reflected on the people on the Earth that are hearing the creator of the heavens identify them with Earth notice again in Exodus 19:6 and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel so now God is using the mouth of a prophet to relate God's special design and choice for the children of Israel and it comes through the prophet's message to help the people to see this now he never exactly told Abraham this he never exactly told Isaac or Jacob these words because the Revelation is now growing to what God wants them to be so who does he use the word comes only to a prophet not to a pastor not to a teacher not to an evangelist so God speaks these words this is the message of that day so God is letting them know that they will be a kingdom of priests now remember not a priesthood but a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel Deuteronomy 7:6 for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God look at the word holy sacred Saint set apart a holy people saint that's amazing because the Hebrew and the Greek and the way this ties together this word is very very similar when it comes to the New Testament so it's really special to be called a saint of God a Sanctified one cesh which means one that is called apart from everybody else now keep in mind it's already written up there that little tiny blue dot the only one that has horses and cows and pigs and all this sort of thing by whom by God so God put it in the past so it could receive of his great benefits now here God is saying about a people I'm going to call you out to myself for thou art Unholy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself special possession peculiar treasure literally to be to him for a people of property a people his own his peculiar property you can see why typical Le toan will never be able to be this they're going to do what they want to do when they want to do it and there ain't nobody going to tell them no different now they want to go to church many of them do they're religious and they want to go to church but they don't want you telling them what kind of clothes to wear how they've got to do this and do that and the other all they want is a preacher that preaches greasy Grace and they can get by with anything and everything they want to do they don't want no dos and no don'ts come on somebody they don't want no you can't do this and you can't do that and you can't go here and you can't say this all they want is freedom to do whatever they want to do and then when they die they all go flying away to Heaven they live like the devil they acted like the devil they cuss they drink they lie they cheat they steal and when they die they all wind up going to heaven that is a lie you only walk down the streets of gold if you are living a life worthy of the Gospel praise the Lord now now God says now you imagine these adjectives that God is using thou art a holy people now this did not mean they were a sinless people or without mistake but they were called apart set aside set aside for God the Lord thy God ha chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people as the Earth is chosen above all the other planets it doesn't really matter if Mars is jealous or not it doesn't matter if Saturn gets M say well my goodness my name ain't even in the Bible Uranus can say my name is not even in the Bible Pluto say I'm jealous my name is nowh written in the Bible the Earth's name is the only planet written in the word of Goden well praise the Lord neither can Earth say oh look at who I am and look at what I am I am so special I am so loved and you are because God was the one who loved you neither can we go around with a stuck out chest and her head kick back oh my looking down on other people if you are part of the Bride you ought to be so grateful you ought to be so happy that God himself chose you above all people that are on the face of the Earth how many believes this to be God's word how many believes he's the same yesterday today and forever so it could choose people in the Old Testament and make them above all the rest of the people and then comes in the New Testament somehow Brother D and God got saved well when Jesus died God got saved and God got he really got you know worked over and really got changed and everything and now God don't practice that that evil thing of predestination predestination ain't evil in the first place notice in Deuteronomy 7:7 the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all people so where's them great big things they did where's them great big things we do but because Hallelujah the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the Lord brought you you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house AB bondman somebody ought to be praising the Lord with me that's the very reason the Lord God called us out in this last day not because we're great people not because we're wonderful people not because our human character surpasses everybody else if it was not for the grace of God many of you'd be out drunk this morning or trying to get some cure from a headache that you had because you drunk last night you'd be looking for another shot in your arm you'd be running around with somebody else's wife or somebody else's husband come on children let's have church today I'll tell you why you said here today if you love Jesus Christ with all of your heart it's because the Lord God chose you not because you're special not because you are good but because he is mighty He is wonderful and he gives Grace To whom he will give [Applause] it woo know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations Deuteronomy 142 for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God and the Lord hath chosen thee To Be A peculiar people unto himself above all the nations that are upon the Earth I'd like to say to Hamas the PLO the Brotherhood from Egypt I'd like to say to Hezbollah the Lord God chose Israel you can partner up with a r you can partner up with Russia Israel partnered up with God Hallelujah let the enemies of this message promote their lives let them write news articles let them get on YouTube and say what they will but the Lord God chose William bradam to be the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 and there ain't enough devils in hell to shake the bride of Christ away from the message of the last days Hallelujah there ain't enough videos on YouTube there ain't enough articles in the newspaper you will never move the [Applause] bride Hallelujah I absolutely love this scripture in Deuteronomy 4:20 but the Lord has taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace out of the iron furnace even out of Egypt to be unto him a people of inheritance friends that's us we are a people of inheritance a people of inheritance now that don't just mean that you get one an inheritance it means you are one I know it's almost more than our minds can comprehend but the Lord God's inheritance is his people it's not the Stars it's not the galaxies or the universe but the Lord's portion is his people a people of inheritance Deuteronomy 9:29 yet they are thy people Moses speaking back to God now yet they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest out by Mighty power and by thy stretched out arm notice God delivered them by a stretched out arm and in the New Testament God delivered his new testament bride by stretched out arms Hallelujah Eli elast my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me and Hell Rejoice no doubt prematurely because they thought that Miracle Worker that sign worker that man that could walk on water now he's died like any other man and the devil probably thought boys we have defeated did him until a knock come down on Hell's door and when the knock come down on Hell's door and the door was answered and they realized there was the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end oh Hallelujah who was it the same Lord God that brought Israel out of Egypt had now come down to deliver his people with outstretched arms Deuteronomy 328 when the most high this is absolutely amazing to me when the most high divided the Nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of Adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel it wasn't first come first serve it's Those whom he loved so you imagine the sons of Adam when God was dispersing them and sending them toward mishek and tubal and all the different places that God dispersed them God's divine order the measuring tape that God used was election the election according to Israel so from the naval of the Earth as Jews the Jews call Jerusalem the naval of the Earth from the naval of the earth God measured that way and that way and that way and that way it wasn't how big Russia was it wasn't how great Lisbon Portugal was it wasn't how great the Spanish were in Spain but God's measuring tape was the children of Israel hallu how much country you all need children how much room you need you said boy y'all y'all got y'all got a big altar here you got a big area yeah sometimes we need a lot of shouting room sometimes we need a lot of room for a lot of prayer line come on somebody don't you know how much the Lord God uses in the last day the measuring tape of the hour is God's word that he's measuring the people of the world by how much space do we need I'll tell you one of the Reas reason why that the life's day and the scientific things are the way they are because God knew we was going to need to reach the people around the world we couldn't just send brother Daryl on a boat the way that Paul traveled on but we needed the message to fall Hallelujah to be able to go and travel like a salt so right this morning people in friends are streaming this service people in Norway are streaming this service why God knew in the life I'm going to let science progress so my word can reach around the world that's how much my children need [Applause] it anybody say the devil which Dory went out of when the most high divided the Nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of Adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel Deuteronomy 329 for the Lord's portion is his people well I don't I'm telling you sometimes I feel like he got short changed you got to be kidding me I mean I'm talking about me you know some of y'all of course are better than I am but I'm talking about me I think man he sure got the little end of the stick as we say I got all I got from him and getting every day and still getting every day and my future is looking even brighter than my past and how much I got and he got me a flawed human being that was flawed from the time I took my first breath and will be flawed when I take my last and yet he said I want I don't want gold I don't want silver I don't want Stars I don't want constellations I want people and the prophets tell us and spoken words original SE that God predestinated a world of Sons and Daughters of God and you mean we are what he gets back wow you ever make a trade of a car or a gun or something like that you go you drive that car home and think I think I made a bad trade can I have my car back can I have my have gun back can I have oh man I'm but the way God looked at it God says no Donnie hallu I got the best part cuz he sees us as we really are Lord God for the Lord's portion is his people Jacob is the lot of his inheritance you got to be kidding me Moses would use him in his deceiver name Moses never even wrote his new name Israel Prince don't you say it magnifies the grace of God in his Jacob form God says he's mine Jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him in a desert land and then the waste howling Wilderness that's where he found us was it brother Steve he leted him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye well I'd like to take them threes sometimes he led him about he instructed him and he kept him as the apple of his eye this is a Hebrew idiom which is not an apple hanging on a tree but it's actually the pupil in your ey so it's not something external from yourself it's a part of you it's a part of who you are oh my I was standing in front of a mirror the other day and it was one of these lighted mirrors and I was combing my hair and as I I'd wash my hair and I'd combing my hair and blowing it dry and as I stood in that mirror I saw the reflection of that lighted mirror in my eyes so in my pupils were two square light Rings one in this eye and one in that eye and what I was looking at I saw myself but I also saw what was helping me to see myself and where was it reflecting not on my fingers not on my hands my skin because there's nothing there to reflect it but I saw what I was looking at in my eyes don't you understand why we needed a profit in the last days that God could bring the eyes back on the earth that the eyes could be able to say I no longer call you church but I call you bride Hallelujah and the eyes could tell us you were with him before the foundation of the world he loved you he called you by name and the more we look into that we can say daddy that's me that's me he found him in a desert land and in a waste howling Wilderness he let him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye First Kings 8 50 Solomon's dedication prayer of the temple and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all the transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee and give them compassion before them who carried them captive that they may have have compassion on them I found that so amazing and looking at that yesterday that Solomon not only prayed for the compassion of God but he prayed that God would move on the hearts of the other people that was against them that they also would be able to give them compassion as well for they be thy people and thine inheritance which thou brought us forth out of Egypt from the midst of the Furnace of iron that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant unto the supplication of thy People Israel to hearken unto them and all that they call For unto thee for thou did US separate them from among all the people of the earth notice as God separated the Earth so he separated Israel to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant when thou brought us out our fathers out of Egypt oh Lord God my brother Donnie that was Old Testament Titus Chapter 2 verse 13 looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and Our Savior Jesus Christ not one of the Gods but the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ one and the same who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works look at the New Testament word now peculiar that which is one's own belonging to one's possessions a people selected by God from the other nations for his own possession so you mean God did that in the Old Testament and God can do it in the new yes he can and he did and I'm happy for it he amen amen notice in 1 Peter chap 2:9 but ye are a chosen generation eclectus eclectus elect picked out chosen by God to obtain salvation through Christ Lord have mercy you mean to tell me we are chosen by God to obtain salvation Choice select the best of its kind or class excellent preeminent now this is Peter writing in the New Testament amen ye are a chosen generation ation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people purchase possession one's own property that's why the bride wants total obedience to the Lord if the Lord says don't go here don't do this don't dress this way don't act like that way oh my church said that don't matter are you married to your church are you married to Christ the word amen A peculiar people that should show Force the Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness where to Into His Marvelous Light praise be to God oh I always as a kid whenever I was going to school I always loved looking up the meanings of words I don't know why I was a little illiterate Kentucky hillbilly I don't know why in the world I like the meanings of words maybe it's for getting ready to be a preacher years on but to me when I look up the meanings of this words it just adds so much to the word of God listen this that those of you that are called be so named to call aloud utter in a loud voice to invite to call by name to Bear a name or title among men we are not just saying we are bride but God called us to be bride God called us by name and gave us an identity Oh Glory to God which in time past were not a people but are now oh I like to preach sometime on that but now but now the people of God which is Loos tribe Nation all those who are of the same stock and language of the same stock and language how we going to know who the elect are they're going to say what the spirit has said and the prophet and the bride are saying the Oh Glory to God so they're from the same stock and they're talking the same language come on somebody they're talking like Father Talked oh my but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy List stand list that about one of the puniest hand claps I ever heard in my life surely you can give the Lord Jesus better than that oh my we were not a people but we are now a people of God go a tribe of the same stock of the same language yes sir all right remember them tribes in Israel and whenever there's going to be a certain code word that they would let them know that they was up on the message of the hour but certains of those people couldn't say that word so they'd say shth yeah or ciles now they knew now that's very close only one letter difference but when You' come up and they'd ask you for the word and you'd say Cil or shth they knew you were in the light of the hour cuz some people just couldn't say it well Glory aren't you glad you can say it aren't you glad you can say what God Said oh yeah you can say Oh Glory to God God sent Propet amen oh the Lord Jesus come and died for us that's well and good but you're going to have to get to a place that you can say what he said Hallelujah about you it ain't going to be enough to say what he said about the prophet of Malachi 4 for that Prophet said when the bride recognizes who she is the rapture will not come but the Rapture will gol and then brother Skippy says the coming of the Lord is a sudden secret going away sir how can a coming be a going how can a coming be a going so the coming of the Lord is a sudden secret going away so what you going to say on that ciles or shiles if God says I'm chosen I'm going to forget what I believed all my whole life I ain't no good I ain't no count I'm rotten I'll never amount to nothing come on somebody if God says I'm chosen I'm chosen if he says I'm a royal priesthood guess what I'm a royal priesthood oh but I don't feel like it brother Donnie he never said if you feel like it you are he just said you are well praise the Lord are we or not are we going to say what God says yes sir if you remember I told you years and years ago one of the greatest challenges the bribe will have in the last days is believing what God said about her or what she knows about herself and her humanity and some of you let the devil constantly beat you down and whip you down even make you question if you've got the Holy Ghost if you're born again and because there's something in you longing for more and you think you're longing for the Holy Ghost it ain't that that's all a part of perfection is in you longing for a perfect world a perfect walk and you're thinking God maybe there's something in me there's lacking there's something lacking in me it's not that it's lacking it's one of the best signs in the world that you've got it how could Perfection that was not in you long for perfection in another world thanks be to God hallelujah aren't you glad we've been called out of Darkness we've got a sister that's going to be baptized here today she turned in her testimony a while back she had been on drugs for many many years the Lord God delivered her thank you Lord she come right up here for prayer and sit right there on this side cuz she want to be delivered of something else she's dealing with she turned in the testimony here the other day the same God that took the drugs away from her took the thirst of smoking away from her that's God what an acenta we can't do it she couldn't do it herself Hallelujah what's it doing calling people out of Darkness them things that bound them and Satan thought I've got them I've got them and maybe some of our family and our loved ones we think Lord brother Donnie they've lived so often and they've said some of the aest things about the message ever was as long as they've got a breast in there there's a hope for them there ain't none of us got a predestinated magnifying glass where we can look and see if they're ordained or not God will give Grace who he wants to who are you and I to say they can't have it I've spent my whole life trying to get people saved I've spent my whole life trying to get people in church trying to get people closer to God I ain't giving up now I don't care if the sorest drunk that in Johnson City comes in here that man will come in and sit down this I figure this is one of the best places in the city for him to come and get saved and get filled with the Holy Ghost maybe your son maybe your daughter and all Brother D they've been away from God they're in terrible shape sounds like to me they need Deliverance sound like to me that our God can be able to move for them can you believe for them can you believe for your husband can you believe for your wife remember you are not only a people of inheritance but you've got one call their names call their [Music] names for such a time as this God's ordained you for this hour Hallelujah let's bow our heads together Lord God we're such a privileged People Help Us father Lord I know when the prophet read his text and gave his title is your the life worthy of the gospel and he talks about the last pool before the supper was to the blind the lame the halt the crippled well here we are Lord Jesus many of us been saved and in church for years and years help us not to be so Pious and so holy as we think we are sometimes that we'd be afraid to reach out our hand to some man or some woman Lord God they might not smell so good they might even be homeless may not have enough money to buy thems a meal but how do we know some of these homeless people around John City here might be the last one that'll come that's right help us Lord we don't have to hand them out a book we don't have to give them a seven seal book or a church age we could start with a smile we could start with a kind word as we go through the drive-thru and we order a Big Mac and they get us a fish Fil-A we order a Sprite they give us pumpkin juice now we can get mad or we can go through with the spirit of Christ and Let Jesus Express his love through the drive-thru the way he does in a message PE after all if the only good they're getting out of this church coming to church is what they have here and it don't live beyond here I am a complete failure we want Jesus to be on display on our jobs and our homes and our workplace Lord help us father A peculiar people a chosen people you purchased my right to be in divine order I believe I've been in my place for years I'm not really praying to get in my place but now I'm praying to stay in it help a lot of these people to realize it's not so much that they're trying to find it it's just staying where you've put them help us Lord Jesus I pray with every head bowed today I wonder how many of you would like to say God please help me maybe some of you're searching I know you are you come up for prayer some of our young people getting out of high school going into college whatever more and they're searching for their their place and what does God want them to be searching for a boyfriend a girlfriend a husband or a wife and they're searching for their position but some of you no doubt by the grace of God you've been able to find it but today your need is God help me that I'll stay there help me that I'll not get out of my place and if Satan comes to me with a supernatural offer which remember the prophet told us in Harvest time he would do that for those those of us who believe in the Supernatural Satan has all types of Supernatural offers that he will offer you to seduce you out of your position brother B said he may let you prophesy and it be contrary to the word he may let you speak in tongues not God the devil the devil offer you a supernatural offer to let you speak in tongues or prophesy and prophesy contrary to the word but because it would seem like a new planet a new place to start a new civilization a new world don't think your battle will stop just because you get in your place but it just begins in defending it and holding it how many of Christians say God help me keep me instruct me my hands are up Lord the Bible gives us warning If any man thinks he stand let him take heed lest he fall Lord God help me keep me Jesus keep me in my place Lord hide me oh God in the covert of your wings Lord I gave my teens to you my 20s my 30s my 40s my 50s way up now in my 60s how much every time I've got left Lord I want you to have every day I don't understand it but sometimes when preachers get older it's when they leave and get off the word Keep Me Jesus please Lord if you'd see some where I'd go to leave get off the word and be a stumbling block to your people if I'd get stubborn and hard-headed and can't be corrected take me out of this world father if you have to I don't want to be a hindrance to your people I want to help people Lord May the spirit of God move from the pulpit here to the back to the mezzanine to the nurseries to those that are streaming Lord may we realize our challenge in this day being a peculiar chosen called out people to be in our place and be identified with who we are oh how it must break your heart when some of you're redeemed and they think they're not even saved some who are sealed by the Holy Ghost and yet they're constantly coming to the Altar for the Holy Ghost help us Lord to recognize who we are yes Lord granted I pray father We Worship You Jesus Hallelujah can we who were not a people but who are now a people can raise our hands in the presence of God and let's just worship Him Now think of it some of you in those same hands years ago used to put a cigarette between them two fingers or a cigar or a pipe or marijuana or you take a needle in your hand and shoot something in your arm to try to bring you a little peace a little Joy satisfaction of life now can you raise those hands in the presence of God and thank him for what he's done for you called you by name remember I read it to you last week that he tell the Stars he knows the number of them and he calls them all by name and how much more value are you than they praise the Lord oh oh we worship you Jesus let's sing a little something he can we just spend a few minutes now before before our sister gets baptized just worshiping the Lord together now [Music] hallelujah hallelujah you who used to sing country music jazz blues rock and roll but now you can sing about Amazing Grace part and mercy and forgiveness and Heaven Hallelujah God didn't stop you singing he just changed your song he didn't stop you dancing you just changed partners and give you a holy dance praise be to God let's worship him together now oh jesusall we worship you Lord as I look across this congregation today as their Pastor knowing many of their lives and their past and their failures and their faults and many of them even after they got saved the horrible things they've been involved in Lord who would have ever thought we would have been called the people of God Amen but you reach down lord Jesus and you look beyond our fault and you saw a need Hallelujah and you made us the lot of your inheritance and before long we'll be gathering with the rest of the lot in the resurrection oh Jesus hasten the day we pray Lord God sing something for us har let's just close our eyes now Saints let's just worship him now oh praise the Lord Jesus oh Jesus Draw Me Close oh Jesus

Lord your grace and mercy by sending us a a message in this hour Lord transformed our hearts changed our lives Lord and we're here tonight not because of anything that we had done any Merit of our own but father it's by your grace your mercy Lord your loving hand father reached down and you completely did away with the facts and Lord we're here today by your truth and we just God we ask this this evening that you'll just come and speak to our hearts Lord that you would be the voice behind the voice father it not be a man standing here to try to say anything that would help anybody personally but Lord may it be you to come and and just console the Heart Tonight Lord you you see the need here at the church you see what the church has been through the great Affliction but Lord we believe right now father that you're still God you're still on the throne and you're still much able tonight to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can even ask or think so we just Commit This service into your hand hands Lord and we just want to say thank you for it now in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles we can be turning to 2 Corinthians 4 and: 7 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 7 just want to greet you in the precious name of the Lord just say what a great honor it is to be here with you this evening you each of you have been in our prayers the church has been in our prayers the Reagan family the Parker family has been on our prayers you know there's churches as we have we're sister churches and yet there's a great bond between many of us and our churches and when you suffer we suffer and you've not suffered alone and sister Erica didn't go down and defeat but she's going to rise in Victory right and that's what we believe tonight the truth is she's already won the truth is between 6:00 and 9: in the morning she's going to come walking through these doors the truth is she's already waiting on us the truth is it ain't over yet God has to final save tonight and so we just we just want to want to greet you and just I'm glad to have my wife with me my daughter Rebecca was supposed to be here tonight but she kind of took a sickness from the camp and his home or back at uh the house there running fever but we want to thank brother Donnie for having us uh glad that he and sister kurl can get away and trust that they can get a time of refreshing after everything settles here and want to say thank you to brother Caleb and sister Ruth for having us they've taken us in like orphans but I'm going to tell you man I've been living like a king and house it's been wonderful I just told my wife said I sure hope we hadn't overextended our stay but we're we're greatly honored to be here and we bring greetings from our church our pastor brother Tim but if you have your Bibles here I want to speak to you tonight on this ain't going to be the end this ain't going to be the end you believe that tonight how many of you come to have church tonight now Brother Lou kind of gave a preface of how I preach so you know you've seen us uh I'm not going to be a berserk up here but we just want to say something that's going to encourage you but we find here in 2 Corinthians 4 and: 7 but we have this treasure this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death of for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present s us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through Thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man's outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and external weight of Glory while we look not on the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal God bless you tonight you can have your seats sure enjoy the specials and the youth choir it's great to see the young people appreciate that great to see the young people tonight just worshiping the Lord I think we have seen a change in our youth in this message over the last maybe the five to six years we've seen a shift we've seen those that you know they didn't want to have anything to do with it it was the rules of does and don'ts but now there's been such a love affair and these young people are are just apt to get to every camp meeting they can I know for you got four kids like me you take out home loans and send them to these camps cuz it means that much to you but you know I just enjoy to see their Zeal for the Lord and so thankful for that we look here in Psalms 34 and: 18 the Bible says that the Lord is n unto them that have a broken heart and he saveth such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord we become a Christian and our lives are committed to God it's not going to be a flowery better eats it's not going to be just you know cupcakes and and and pancakes and anything else and and things like that but we're going to go through hard times and even as churches we're going to face difficult moments but the Bible says the Lord deliver them out of them all we have a promise tonight that God will deliver God's not going to allow you to keep going down in that same path of Destruction God's not going to let your young people go down in destruction but we have a promise that God is is faithful and he's faithful to his word and he's faithful to his people that will uphold his word and we know that as long as we're in this world and long as we're in these bodies I don't know about you but these bodies ain't perfect yet but as long as we're in these this body this this decaying Humanity we're going to face trouble we're going to face hardships we're going to face many difficult times but though this outward man perish the Bible says the inward man is renewed day by day by day by day by day how are you renewed cuz you feed on the word of God day by day by day by day we're not trying to get in on our own marriage or what family we're born into or or what church we're attend no the inward man is renewed by the word of God that's why God sent us a prophet God sent us a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith so that the inward man would be renewed and draw strength from the word because he knows this is not how it [Applause] [Music] ends oh Hallelujah see there's going to be times and it feels like even here maybe for a local church you're feeling like it's trouble on every side yeah trouble on every side but the inward man is invigorated he's renewed and the Bible tells us I love how the Bible puts it we're troubled on every side that word trouble means to be squeezed how about how many of you have ever been squeezed you just you feel the pressure of this age you know some people are looking for a squeeze stupid I'm ain't looking for I'm looking to get out of the squeeze but people are looking for the squeeze to come and when the squeeze comes we know he's coming look church I don't know if you're de dumb and blind but the squeeze is here we're persecuted on every side the Bible tells us we're troubled we're squeezed we're in his grasp we're pressed hard but not distressed Oh Glory to God tonight we may be in a battle but we ain't lost to war yet we may be persecuted but God is still on our side the facts may be stacked against you but the truth is we've already won the truth is we serve a living God the truth is he's still on the throne Bible tells us that we're perplexed and that word perplex is filled with uncertainty sometimes how many sometimes you don't know which way to go you're praying for answers and answers are not there you're trusting and you're like Lord are you even hearing my prayer the Bible says we're we're perplexed we fill with uncertainty yet not in Despair and the word despair is at at a complete loss as those that have no Hope Oh church we got a hope we got our anchor steadfast and sure that's behind the veil let me tell you we got something to be glad about tonight we got something to worship God about tonight will you say brother Joe something just drastically happened to our church I understand that and I grieve with you but yet the word is still true God is going to see us through this God is going to see you you through this oh this ain't the end church this is only the beginning of great things for Word of Life Church bible would tell us that we're persecuted pursue from place to place follow around with menaces and curses and reproaches imprisoned and threatened with the severest of tortures I don't know about you but my I feel like that every day we're persecuted but not forsaken brother Jackie thank you Lord Brother Jackie even in your old age you may have been persecuted and you've been perplexed there's been times you didn't know which way to turn but God had never left you alone and you're still here as a mighty warrior still standing for this truth sa said well I'm going to take them I'm going to take them by this and I'll take him by that but the devil don't have the final say God has the final word God has the final say and he's here to T tonight it ain't going to end like that amen we've been cast down and that word there means to be thrown down dashed into pieces but yet not destroyed oh I love that not not ruined we don't lose that word destroyed there means to lose we don't lose Church why cuz God can't lose and though we're troubled on every side perplexed and persecuted and cast down the Bible never states that the believer is defeated right the Bible never states that we we go down and defeat we lose it's over that's not what the Bible says but to every contradiction to the persecution God said there's a promise of Resurrection God says there's a promise of a new day God says there's a promise that this is not how it end it ain't over until God says it's over and God's still on the throne he's still full of rich and mercy and Grace for you [Applause] tonight many times the adversary has Us in his grasp many times we're troubled amilies go through Cycles troubles in the home churches go through Cycles Seasons trouble come to churches it seems like the adversary wants to get you at your weakest moment when you've been in battle and you you smelt the breath of the enemy in your face grasp his hands upon you brother that's real when he whispers in your ear there's no hope for you you might as well quit you might as well stop while you even trying don't you understand you just wasting your time the pastor's time the church's time your family's time you're wasting their time but I'm here to tell you tonight you're not wasting time church God has called you for this oh let me just tell you like one back in 19 1979 there was a man by the name of John Paul Jones how many famili with John Paul Jones oh he was a he was a general there and he he sail the Great season this was during the Revolutionary War time and it was the battle at flambo and yet here he was little lone ship he was after the British army sometimes you may feel isolated sometimes you may feel all alone and he had 41 ships that were coming against him and he turned his boat to the broad side of the enemy ship and he blasted his two 18lb guns and when they blasted the the the guns blew up and blew a great big hole in the ship and the ship was was on fire and his ship was taking in water and it seemed like he was going down and the captain from the other ship said do you surrender he said I have yet begun to fight oh come on church tonight oh you may have been hit enemy hit just church and he come and put a hoing but I'm here to tell you tonight we have yet begun to fight we're standing tonight for the truth we're standing for healing we're standing for deliverance we're standing for thust sayith the Lord we're now backing up we're not giving in we're standing here we're going to fight to the Finish we're going to fight to the end see Satan wants you to surrender he wants you to give up and walk away in defeat brother Lance Parker called me this morning or this evening and he sent me a text the day before sister Erica passed away and he said this is her comment that stupid devil right here she is gasping for breath that stupid devil he knows that it ain't going to end like this and so that's where I took my text tonight it ain't going to end like this right no it look like it ends in defeat it looks like we're taking on water it looks like we're destroyed oh it looks like we're persecuted it looks like we're defeated oh but Church we're not persecuted we're not in this we're not forsaken it is not the end of the end we're just beginning to fight come on Word of Life this is the time you fight like you never fought before this is the time you gather together like a church body like you never had before this is a time that we were we come together with one resolve one determination whatever we're going to live and we're going to preach and we're going to stand for this word this is a time not to lay down your weapon this is a time to fight don't give up don't walk away this is a time to be greater committed to the cause this is a time to be more determined than ever to be Fearless sometimes you know what it takes to get Fearless a nice drink of whiskey you're like brother Joe what do y'all do down in Louisana well I'm going to go ahead and be honest we get drunk right oh there was a a bar on 1700 three Highway 371 called even like Tabernacle you can walk in there sober but oh let me tell you you get your a good drink of that Holy Ghost you get your a good drink of that man you feel like you're 10t tall and bulletproof like that little mouse fell in that wine jar just Goble Goble Goble go back down and drink more by the time that jar was empty he kep crawling out of that jar where is that old cat at anyway let me tell you where is that Old Devil at anyway we have just begun to fight this ain't the end this is just the beginning and we're coming together we're rallying together what for the final push for the final call for the great fight we're not going down in defeat but we're coming together the church body Satan wants you to think there's no chance of survival you know we find today reports are coming in over over and over this one went cancer that one went cancer and when you hear it fear just seems to grip us doesn't it fear begins to grip us but you know I'm determined to preach Faith like never before that God is still on the throne either God's word is truth or it's not either he's a Healer or he's not either he's a deliverer or he's not right either the prodical come home or they don't but I'm here to tell you I can testify that God is his word and his word never fails in the mouth of a Believer amen yes sir but Satan wants you to give up he wants you to surrender he don't want you to think there's any chance of survival he wants you to think that death is the only option he doesn't want you to fight but Winston Churchill would say it like this when his country was in the greatest battle of their life greatest conflict he said we shall defend our Island whatever the cost we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the Hills we shall Never Surrender maybe the devil's whispering in your ear surrender just give up walk away don't you see God don't keep his word I'm here to tell you we're going to fight for truth church let me just put in my own words tonight we're going to we're going to defeat in this message with everything that we got whatever the cost we're going to fight for our families we're going to fight for our children we're going to fight for our healing we're going to fight for deliverance we're going to fight for Joy we're going to fight for peace we're going to fight for the Holy Ghost we're going to fight for the supernatural we're going to fight for prayer L we're going to fight for alter call we're going to fight all devil here to tell you tonight we're going to fight it ain't going to end like you think it is there a great big church here that's all Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the power of God tonight we're not backing up it may appear that the enemy's winning it may many are sick diagnosis of cancer coming in left and right homes are being destroyed marriages are in shambles many have walked away from this message young people strung out on drugs right but it don't end like that I'm telling you Church it ain't going to end like that brother B Will Tell Us in the greatest battle ever fought he goes there you are he said it takes the word of God cut your way through every doubt see sure that's it that's the next job let it get done right next thing I'm going to do is get away from my doubts and cut it down and that's my next job is get all my frustrations away can we just for a few minutes tonight get all of our frustrations away get all the cares of today in this week behind us and say God I'm going to cut my way through all the doubts cut my way through all the unbelief cut my way through all the Affliction cut my way through all the nonsense Lord I'm going to C my way through tonight and receive from your [Applause] word see my senses tell me Well you feel bad come on Word of Life well I just don't feel like it well poor you man you look at brother Ron Spencer stage four cancer brain lungs throughout his body that man gets up there and un pukes his guts up the night before and yet he's standing there preaching the gospel like you never been sick and you say well I got a toothache I got a headache I broke my fingernail oh come on somebody it's is time that we get in and we lay into this word and we attend the services and let the new man or the inward man be renewed service after service after service with with a more determination to serve God like never before cut your way through the doubts right you know young people you got to cut your way through some things got to cut your way through some family strains right there's a lot of things you got to overcome as a young person yes sir a lot of complexes you got to overcome am I good enough am I pretty enough am I skinny enough well let me tell you you ain't going to ever be enough that's right because devil was going to keep putting something out there a little bit better a little bit skinnier a little bit better looking a little bit prettier come on oh but we're not basing ourself and our character and where God wants us on anything that the devil has to offer so you got to pull down and cut your way through complexes and cut your way through depression cut your way through those suicidal thoughts right right brother Andrew and I have done a lot of prayer lines in youth camps together a lot of you find a lot of times that they come in with depression and suicide begins to to attach itself to depression and you begin to work with that patient and work with that young person and you finally click to it and you find what the issue is and we we many times we have cast that thing off because we got a right to cast it off but Satan tells well it's going to end like this you're going to cut your wrist you're going to die there's going to be so many people come to your your funeral and oh you're going to be remembered so great that's how he wants you to think come on brother I don't want be on the other side looking down because I've done something stupid stupid but we find you got to cut your way through these things cut your way through all these things that trying to come against you the Bible Will Tell Us in Ephesians 6 verse 10 finally my brother be strong in the Lord Lord notice not strong in your own self not strong in in some man's Doctrine not strong in where you go to church not strong in this that other but be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might see put on the whole armor of God and there's no armor for the back there's no retreat for the believer there's no surrender for the believer it's a on full on battle full on war you got to face him head on we find here says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places then he says take onto us the whole armor of God that we may be able to withstand in the evil day that's this day God has prepared us to stand in this day and he's given us the equipment by which we are to stand in this day take on this word notice we're wrestling it's a contest we're not wrestling with flesh and blood me and brother Andrew or me and brother Joe or me and this other brother we're not wrestling because maybe I'm just a little bitty pipsqueak I mean I'm 5'5 and and a half that's right give me a hand clap I went to the doctor about 3 months ago and they told me uh you're 5' 5 and a half I'm like what my whole life I've been 5 six and A2 they robbed me of an inch brother Daryl I'm going tell you what I'm getting my inch back come on yeah I just turned 48 not too long ago and older you get the shorter you get the lost I mean I lost my hair thank God I got my wits about me but we find that we're fighting against principalities against wickedness in high places we're fighting to get back in our position as Sons and Daughters of God and their Satan and his minions and devil after devil trying to keep you from getting back to your position Satan don't want you to recognize who you are but from the beginning in the mind of God you always was a Son of God you always will be a Son of God there ain't enough devils in hell can take that away and if that's the casee then it don't have to end like this it don't have to go down like this we can take our position take our Authority and take our rights to the word and back Satan in a [Applause] corner amen we find today that many Believers even Christians many Believers today they're wrestling against anxieties fears brother Andrew how many times you deal with anxiet and fear in prayer lines fear that I'm not going to be healed fear that I'm not going to be saved fear that I can't keep the Holy Ghost fear that I'm going to go down in the feet worried about this anxiety and all pressur it up we they wrestle against depression complexes demon oppression and see these are not flesh and blood battles because if they were Flesh and Blood battles we'd go out and get the best AR-15 we can buy man we' have an armor full we could take care of but these things that you can't just go out and buy some weapon no but God has provided you exactly what you have need of God has given us the greatest protection not only for a defense but God has giving you what you need for an offensive War you know what I think many times we pray and we oh God help us here and oh God help us there and when the enemy comes in or we're in the battle we're in the midst of the trenches it's always the bride playing defense I'm here to tell you tonight it's time that the bride takes the promises of God and goes on the offense the Bible says that I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you so when you're in the midst of the battle he's right there when the when hell's all against you he's right there there's no way for the believer to go down in the feet so spray your shoulders back tonight and begin to press the devil I'm not backing up Satan I'm not giving up tonight I'm holding this word that faith is the promise healing is my promise deliver is my promise my kids are my promise my family is my promise my marriage is my promise I'm taking God in his word tonight it's my promise I'm not backing off of It Go on the offense for [Music] once but B tell us in putting on the whole armor of God he said we don't wrestle with toe holds flesh and blood but we wrestle against spiritual powers wrestlers see they practice on breaking toe holes and things he says but you don't break these toe holes no he says could you imagine a wrestler come out with his fingernails polished got his little jelly band on what would Jesus do he wouldn't be wearing a jelly band on oh I better watch out huh right I'm not at home brother Joe all got his fingernails polishes trunks on wearing shorts got his trunks on oh yeah we still believe in a closed line religion the last time I [Applause] heard he goes but you don't break these toes no coming out there with his fingernails polished trunks on with all kind of gold beads around it he goes look like a pretty good wrestler but that's just only intellectual see he hasn't got a hidden strength there that when the enemy gets a Toe Hold on him that he can just pull them out of it see his intellectual beads around him and everything don't make much difference so all of our intellectual means nothing if they're in the hidden power that's right you can know this Bible backwards and forwards you can know every quote backwards and forward but if there is no anointing behind it if there's no power behind it it ain't nothing but head knowledge let me tell you God you'll take that head knowledge and you go right to hell with head knowledge but God has given us an anointing in this hour God has given us a word in this hour and it's got to be more than intellectual understanding it's got to be a Supernatural anointing behind this word to make this word live to go out into the highways and the byways and catch young men by the name of Reed ball and bring them back to the house of God oh in an unexpected place in an unexpected way he goes into some old place to have breakfast not even his favorite place I think God's pretty on time it may not be in his favorite place but it was God's favorite place and God thought so much to come by there and he was just bit annoyed with the old man that begin to bring him the word you may be a little bit annoyed tonight with the young man that's bringing you the word right oh but God God's going to never lose it may look like he was going down in the feet drugs ravishing his life destroyed him pulled him out of the house of God his own daddy didn't want anything to do with him right don't bring your hide to my house I don't want to be around that but God said they don't have to end that way God said it ain't over yet God says I got the final say God says you come from God you come from my thoughts and if you come from my thoughts and that seed is on the inside I don't care how much dirt That Old Devil puts on you how much sin he puts on you whatever he it ain't going to stop that seed Oh Glory to God it ain't going to stop that seed that seed is coming up it's going to come up tonight Church somebody will take that word and believe it's for me it's for my young person it's for my child it's for my grandchild that word is saved today church if it could sa re ball it can save your child oh it ain't got to end that way God is still on the throne he's still full of Mercy he's still full of grace brother Reed where are you tonight yes sir sir I Ed your testimony about 3 weeks ago and I preached the message believe are have faith and believe and I want to tell you this I wanted to tell you in the back but I'm going to tell you right now in front of everybody I showed your testimony yours and your brothers talk to your dad beforehand to get the permission I said he's a bigger boy than I am I got to get permission he mean he said he likes to do Waits I'm like woo I know how big your daddy is told the church he can bench press our church but I showed your testimony at our church and I was preaching on have faith and believe a young man came up at the end of service he said brother Jose this is my third chance so re don't you think your testimony didn't reach somebody already it's done Touch Somebody Satan said he was going down Satan said it was over Satan said he took his family out of the house of God say that he'll never amount to anything he's going down in destruction but by somebody's testimony of a god who's rich in Mercy that young man came and fell on my shoulders and begin to cry his way back to Calvary and he's now serving serving God I'm telling you it ain't got to end the way the devil think and it ain't going to end the way the devil thinks God is rich in Mercy he's still on the throne he's still saving he's still delivering he's still healing he's still oh Hallelujah he's still setting free tonight and he wants you to know Church no matter what you're going through he's got it for says we're in a wrestling match wrestling not with fine dress intellectual psychology but we're wrestling with power and the promise of God which can break any hold on the devil that's right you're intellectual ain't got no power that devil fighting you that intellect that psychology it ain't going to break that toe hole but you take him back to this one time you take him back to to this where's sister Armstrong at is it Armstrong Jessica nope brother Tony's wife Tony big Tony y'all got a Tony here big Tony Tony stand up you're making me look bad I saw you the other day doing parking Tony MRA where's his wife at Angela right Jennifer I don't know these people's name I ain't never I'm not from here all right well they're on vacation but we're not we're in church so let's have church so a couple years ago at our youth camp just to give you another little testimony this is okay tonight at our youth camp it was Sunday morning after the all night prayer line prayer line went to about 1:00 in the morning I was exhausted I got into a bed about 2:00 I was up at 6:00 trying to get the sunrise service but you know I got a slogan call coffee before we pray I'm sorry I was in no mood to pray yet but she had a young girl out there and this girl was tormented and and so they come they said brother Joe sister McGraw needs you over there to pray for I'm like look I'm going to finish my coffee and I know this is going around the world this is it sounds awful awful doesn't it so I I I chugged it real quick and I went over there and be to talk to this young girl and sister Jennifer mgra was right there and we're kneeling down and I'm talking to her and she says you know her friend came in the prayer line night before she had a demon on her so me and my wife and sister lyia oy brother Aaron's wife were in the back we were working with this young girl and she's foaming out the mouth like a dog and this she's raring up and brother darl I'm tell you she was a h 100 times her strength she was a young 16y old girl I work with her for 45 minutes I was wiped out just trying to hold her down so we could pray and begin to begin to be able to cast that devil off and brother Matt McGary came back here and we just begin to work with her because he goes to her church and he knew some things and begin to deal with with anyway we got her to we got this devil cast off of her and I was like oh praise God well the next morning I go over there and this young girl goes to church with she was all nerved up I don't want to be like my friend I'm I'm scared I'm nervous I got all this anxiety I said well oh we'll just praying you can go back in service and enjoy the service it's a sunrise service so I go and lay my hands on her and all of a sudden that Spirit begins to speak I don't like you I said well good I don't like you either so I'm glad we got that settle and see the devil thought he was going to stay there he thought he was going to hide behind that he was going to scare me like I'm afraid of some Demon and I be to pray with her and I said look Satan you can't stay you're an unwelcome guest here you're a squatter here you can't remain here she don't want you here and by the authority of this word we cast you out and that thing left her and she went back inside rejoicing and praising God and she was just at our meetings and she still rejoicing and praising God what am I telling I'm telling you that God has the final say God has the final burden God has the final word your condition ain't too too far for God to move on tonight he's still on the throne Church brother will tell us he defeated Satan with it is written I didn't come up with some psychology to pray for that young girl I just laid hands on and prayed I just believed and you better know what you stand when you start fighting Toe to Toe with an enemy brother tell us the word of God will defeat Satan any place anywhere under any conditions did y'all hear that on the job in the school in the car in church at your house in your quiet time the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anytime under any condition but it takes a hidden man of the heart oh let me get just keep moving on here woo yall a good crowd to preach to tonight Bible would tell us in Romans 8 they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh 8 and verse 5 but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace now I know I'm sitting here talking to a bunch of cherubs y'all ain't never had a caral thought have you not us nope we're Word of Life JC yeah we got this thing covered up brother Joe look around no we got Colonel THS Church come on but the Bible says to be carnally minded see to be carnally minded is imity it's it's against God see it cannot please God but the the caral mind is imity against God but and we're told that that though that walk out through the spirit and that's what we want to get into tonight is the spirit we don't want to walk and come into church all worked up in our cality and in our minds and all the pressures of the world we're living in Leo DEA we're living in Satan's Eden and we hear wars and rumors of war and we're worried about Israel we worried about Ukraine and got all this on them M no that ain't our that's not our battle that's not for us to worry about God's got all that worked out but to be carnally minded is to the things of the flesh to give into the things of the flesh the propensities of our nature and we know that our nature is a fallen nature but God wants us to be spiritually minded to cater to the things of the word things of the Holy Ghost let God be able to speak to you through that still Small Voice so he can nudge you and you know that that's God you're not so consumed with the things of life and the Affairs of life that you miss the nudging of God Amen cuz I know just to be honest with you we all at some point in our walk have missed it and then Satan begins to work on your mind you missed it you missed a call of God you you should have prayed longer come on she would have just spent five more minutes 10 more minutes 30 more seconds if you have not given up God have done something see that's how he wants to get he wants to work on your carnality but see we our battle is not in the mind or it's not in the carnal the carnality of our mind but it's in our spirit realm Satan's trying to defeat us and try to to bring us down and we find here in Romans 12:1 Paul would tell us I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed and that word conformed there means to conform to the same power pattern to be not conformed to the world but to be transformed metamorphosed right you come in like a caterpillar chewing around you know brother J for climbing up that tree walking out on that Branch just chewing away caterpillar but then you you settle in a place oh yeah you settle in Johnson City Tennessee spending a cocoon in Word of Life JC and all of a sudden you've been there a year you've been there two years some of you been in that cocoon a long time you been you still in that cocoon but eventually what comes out of that cocoon is not the same thing that went in that cocoon oh a butterfly went in but a Son of God comes out a sinner comes in all tatted up drunk up Dred up but oh he been spun himself around the word of God and then got into a spirit spiritual atmosphere and he comes out a beautiful creature he comes out a real Son of God where the things of the of the world the things of the flesh no longer have a pull on him no longer have a desire in his heart anymore no why because why he's a different creature he's been transformed by the word of God he's been metamorphed by the word he's been changed by the word church let me tell you I know what I'm talking about when I was 21 years old I was headed to a devil's hell and a sinner great oh but God rich in Mercy came down and he said turn your car around I was trying to kill myself but God said it don't have to end that way I was out on all night drunk by 2:00 in the morning spirit of God I wouldn't I didn't grow up in a church didn't grow up in a message Church didn't grow up in a BAP my family was on drugs and things like that let me tell you it was an awfulness but there was a seed planted I said there was a seed planted I didn't know about that seed I didn't know that I come from God oh but through the memory of my father he be to share with me where I came from where I'm going and he came down one night about 2:00 in the morning and he said turn your car around I turned my car around I went home and up beside my bed and gave my heart to God let me tell you I ain't never taking it back oh I'm a Child of God tonight I'm a Child of God tomorrow I'll feel a child of God why because God said it don't have to end that way you don't have to kill yourself you don't have to go down in the feet you don't have to go down in the you're my child I'm coming by your way [Applause] tonight the natural mind notice 1 Corinthians 2 verse4 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him yes yeah neither can he know them because why they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we come on put your hand up we amen but we but we have the mind of Christ and let this mind that was in Christ be in you what was the mind of Christ he

your need tonight God's able let me begin to wrap this up tonight next slide how many know what this is I know you're intelligent it's a chess board how many know what the main piece on that board is what is it it's the king the king is the main piece on the board and let me just tell you your king is the main piece chess it's a game of wit it's where you make moves to get your opponent to make moves it's to where you have to out strategize manipulate your opponent and sometimes you may have to make sacrifices brother Joe you may have to lose one of your pieces so that you can get your opponent into a position that you can Checkmate him see there is a story next slide how many have ever seen this picture this is called checkmate we find here there was a there's a story this picture once hung in the Lou Museum in France and there was a one day there was a group of people coming by to look at the the the museum look at all the nice artifacts and all the artwork and and in this certain group there was a grandm an international chess champion he came in and he looked at the Mona Lisa and just passed it on by and he he looked here at this picture he was in International chess champion and he begin to study and we look at this picture here and we see that we have Satan here on the left but before that we have a chess board that's being played on a coffin cuz Satan is in battle for your soul and we have a king who looks for loone and lost and we have an angel looking over his shoulder it's like there's no hope they're in despair the young king is in checkmate that's what the picture is called so this painting we find that the legend has it this man stood and he looked at this painting and he studied this painting and he watched this painting and we find in this painting we have a lion here with his paw on a skull of the previous victim because there's no Escape so Satan thinks and we see this red feather in his cap which is an ancient emblem of craftiness and cunningness and you look at the pieces of Satan his pieces he is his own King his Queen is a voluptious woman his pieces are anger malice all these different Pride false Su doubt and unbelief and we find the young man's pieces are peace love joy happiness goodness and all these pieces but when you look at this and you look at the pieces here Satan has a lot more pieces than the king there's a spider here who's making making its way to spin another web of snare for this young king to get his next victim so we look at all this and we see that Satan is after our soul right and every move you make plays into his hand and every move he makes can play into your hand so we find that we have we're in a we're in a chest chess match who's going to outsmart the next one they say that a a good chess player can make one move at a time one move ahead of a time or an average chess player can make one move ahead at a time a good chess player can make four to five moves ahead but a grandmas can make 20 moves ahead at a time so he knows you make this move then he's got these next 20 moves made and see that's how Satan does some of you get on that website and you make that move then he's got you boom bo b Bo boom and now you're spiraling down a word of pornography or you go to make this move and you click on believe the sign all of a sudden now you're down this spiral Road of unbelief and that God sent a prophet and that this message is true so Satan's always trying to outsmart he's trying to always blur the lines of black and white and make everything gray things that we used to wouldn't allow in our house now they're welcomed music that we used to would not listen to now we listen to novels and books and magazines that we used to not want to look at now we just allow our kids to feed on them and look at them you know it's not hurting anybody so that's the thing see Satan is looking for weaknesses he's looking for weaknesses and if he can weaken Word of Life Church by getting you to not believe that he's still able that God's still able to he heal he finds that weakness he'll slip in there and he'll begin to manipulate that and he'll begin to bring this one down and that one down and that one down and that one down so we find Satan is always thinking ahead and he'll get you sometimes to make bad choices now how many of you ever made a bad choice yes sir all right praise God I'm in good company he'll make you make bad choices based on your feelings based on your complexes based on fears based on worries based on regrets based on past history family strains well this is who I am I just have to do this no you don't see Satan loves to do that and to back you in a corner but see we find the Bible says or as my wife sung that song the facts may be stacked up against you tonight you may be in a serious battle Satan's going backed you up and say well there's no hope for you there's there's no use of trying there's no use even believing for healing there's no use even believing for deliverance you got to be stuck that way this is who you are it's your makeup but the truth is he's already won the battle right see the facts may be stacked up against you but the truth is God's on your side see the truth is that it's not the end of the story God's the one with the pen in his hand and he told your Prophet pick up the pin and write yeah pick it up this is what I want you to tell my bride that she's a lovely woman oh Church to let you know where you come from cuz he knew you would need a message like this in this hour when all Hells are selling you you can come back to this word and it'll be your anchor so as we find the facts is that we're troubled on every side but the truth is we're not distressed facts is that we're perplexed sometimes we we don't know which way to go but the truth is we're not in despair the facts is we're persecuted but the truth is we're not forsaken the facts are that we're cast down and many of us been cast down many of time but the truth is we're not destroyed we're still here Church we're still believing we're still plugging the law let me just tell you this when the devil is all gone and he's defeated you'll still be standing you'll still be here when when that healing is happened and Satan is defeated he's cast into that Lake of Fire we'll still be worshiping we'll still be praising God what did God tell job job where were you when I hung the foundations of the world where were you job when the sons of God shouted for Jo he was reminding job before the first Affliction before he lost his family before he lost his well that job you were in my thoughts and if you was in my thoughts there you will be in my thoughts now nothing can destroy you Jo this ain't the end of it I'm going to restore more and more unto you and I'm going to take Word of Life Church that God is the same today he's the same yesterday today and for forever church and whatever you have need of He's Able tonight to do it he's able tonight to meet your need He's Able tonight to heal your body He's Able tonight to save your prodical son he's able tonight to deliver He's Able tonight to do whatever you have need of it's not the end of the [Applause] story amen yes sir amen let's get back to the painting as we bring this to a close Grandmaster standing there he's looking at this picture and he's staring at it and he's looking at it and all of a sudden somebody may want to take that cell phone call Satan may be wanting to tell you something he's looking at this picture and he's in the L Museum and all of a sudden he says wait hold up a minute it's all wrong the curator of the museum came over there what's all this excitement about why are you so emotional he said the painting is wrong it's wrong get a hold of the author of the painting because it's title wrong the King has one more move what am I telling you tonight Church of God it may look like you're in Checkmate it may look like

but the king yes the king made a move to her he took that pressure off of her changed her her job Chang her situation now she's the happiest she's ever been the king made a move to Sister Mariah alopecia said she'll never grow her hair but the king made a move living proof in your church living proof some of you young people come to those camp meetings King has made a move to you changed you

be challenges now appear to be blessings greetings one and all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I would like to greet the founder the Visionary leader of Al Tabernacle Christian College our Apostle Edgar Hill Rosco his sons Pastor Jonathan and Pastor Jude sister Abby and the Rosco family at large I am truly honored to be standing before you at this momentous ceremony the 20th anniversity of the best school in the world it's amazing how the two years given to us by the critics has spanned to become 20 years I have been privileged to be called to be what they call furniture of the school my mom says I literally begged to be at the school at the tender age of three thank God I was already party today and Glenn thank God if someone had told me that I would be standing here as an alarmist 20 years later I wouldn't believe you I can still see madal staring as she lowers her glasses and glares into your soul to say perform Jay or he brother Glenn laughing in assembly at to his own jokes my arms still remember the burn as M Teddy drilled us arms up sideways down just to get our attention or the weight in my B in my the weight of the bell in in my hand as I was the designated Val ringer this was way before the bleding sidon of brother Owen's horn was imprinted in my mind I can't forget the assemblies when we'd sing Story and run around the sanctuary the days we spend playing church church or open Gates on the grass or when we'd spot that car driving into the rco parking time Stood Still as we flocked to the driver's side door just to feel the warm embrace when the apostle would hug you I'm just reminded of the first award ceremony okay being a 4-year-old girl I was very young so this was too long the ceremony took way too long but I still remember M Sheila waking me up taking me by the hand and walking with me to the podium as I collected the first and only most popular award it was a good memory in my life I can go on reeling about the wonderful times I've had in this place but nothing can ever compare to the moments spent in in the presence of the Lord whether it be on a Tuesday during break when we would come into the sanctuary to pray or Friday morning when the minister would preach or morning assemblies when a tape would be played or the simple Act of reminiscing on the Sunday or the combined preaching the angel of the lord always graced us with his presence You Never Know What You've Got Till It's Gone I can truly attest to this whenever you having a bad day or feeling distressed if you would just knock on Heaven's Door he would answer you would walk in the hallways you would feel the presence of the Lord or you'd even bump into the Apostle or his sons and you just feel better while walking in the passages I just want to thank God for sending his servant our way for giving him a vision and the Zeal to see it through to fruition I personally don't know where or what I would be if it were not for these walls the safe haven against the evil World a place that not only nurtured us and fed us naturally but spirit spiritually the school hasn't only produced doctors accountants engineers and lawyers but it produced learned individuals who know who God is and where he can be [Applause] found I want each and every one of us to take a look around every brick every pillar every window and every door if you don't believe in the Supernatural you are sitting in a miracle that took 9 years I mean 9 months 9 months people to materialize when he laid the first four bricks appointing Michael Gabriel rapael and urel I believe that the Apostle made provision for everything that has transpired in these 20 years thank you Lord for sending your gift our way thank you Apostle for a vision that saw us through and thank you to the Rosco family that gave their father to us Proverbs 22:6 says train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it thank you Lord for a place that taught us how to fly with both Wings God bless you K just give another beautiful [Applause] hand the next individual one of the first great 12s in 2005 the first head girl of el Tabernacle Christian College in the Year 2005 currently practicing as a chartered accountant can we welcome Jolene [Applause] ludik so I may be from the first class but uh I will say that I keep up with the time so excuse me as I just log in prudy um it's such an honor and a privilege to be here um I must say as I walked in I couldn't help but remember that first day brother Glenn and the small wall at the back there and it just became so real for me um it is an incredible honor and a blessing and a privilege to stand here and speak a little bit about the school and the impact that the school has had on my life so I just firstly want to start by acknowledging the man of God I I think that it goes without saying when you see a man's fruits and his works you cannot doubt that God is with him and I I couldn't help but remember I think it was in Petoria and prudy alluded to this when the Apostle actually announced his vision for this church and the school came with that Vision as well and I remember the Apostle saying that this school will become one of the greatest Outreach mechan mechanisms of the ministry and you know today as I sit here and I think and I look at the faces that sit before me and the ones who have sat in the seats that you now occupy so many Souls that have come through this ministry we can't but thank God for a gift in this [Music] ministry and the and I think it would be a great miss if I do not acknowledge our leadership Pastor Jonathan Pastor Jude Sister Abigail the rosow [Applause] family I remember even sister Sheila the first day and when I came into the ministry I was still a young Christian a very young Christian uh when I came into the school and theila was so instrumental in helping me understand a lot of things and I just want to acknowledge her as well and then I think to just end off my introduction I'd like to just appreciate the teachers of e Tabernacle brother Glenn brother Owen all of the teachers each each one I think that you are handpicked you are chosen of God to cross paths with so many lives and make a difference you may never know the impact that you have um in our lives and I think each of us can attest to a special moment that we share and we carry that with us it's it's those Eternal moments that carry us when we don't feel like we can carry on so thank you to you may God bless you in your efforts as you support the man of God and as you continue this great work so I've been called upon to speak a little bit about the school and uh that includes me as well brother Glenn I when I started I remember with the open day I was very determined to um be in a good good school and overambitious um always wanting to be in a space that I know I'll be able to do well and do my best so because of that and not knowing much about the school it was the first year my mom had arranged for me to have a one-on-one with brother Glenn and uh I I asked brother Glenn I remember sitting in that back classroom brother Glenn you may not remember but I do and I sat down very serious face and I said brother Glenn I just want to make sure you know that this is the right place for me you know and I'm going into matrick and this is an important year and I really just want you to give me that assurance and you know brother Glenn uh gave me that expression which I think many of you can relate to it's a change in the face and it's it goes very serious and you know he you know so I came asking him that and he just turned around and he became very serious and he said to me my sister this is the best place the best school in the world and I have no doubt that you are not going to make a mistake to be in yel Tabernacle and I just took that and I accepted and I walked away and I said you know what um I'm going to give it my all and starting from day one my heart was overjoyed I was like bursting out of my seams because I was so excited to be in a place where I could be surrounded with brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith coming from a a outside school I I just want to give you the short testimony to the young children and Learners City here today um attending an outside school with the dress code a long uniform I remember countless times brother du coming to my home and trying to encourage me to stand despite whatever the obstacle was and those things kept me but when I walked in here it was like home and it wasn't like home I was home and I just want to say to you that the time that you spend here is so critical I have only had the opportunity to be here for one year but I must tell you that this one year was enough to change my life forever I could never be the same after that and I think if I were to just cross over and speak about the school we know that you know the fundamental pillars of the school is to fly with both Wings spiritual and academic and what makes the school so successful and so great and so unique is the spiritual element as I mentioned before I was really young when I joined the school and I needed a lot of help and when I joined the school the thing that always captivated me was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'll let you in on a little secret here I know my brother is here you'll probably laugh but just before we join the ministry I um we attended a Pentecostal church and I was so desperate for the holy ghost that I was saying to them you know I really want to change I really want to live right and by then we weren't in the ministry and the the minister is going and he's pushing and uh I was so desperate and then he says raise your hands you know and people start like falling you know in the spirit and then I didn't know the Holy Ghost and I also thought you know what this is the way so I just threw myself on the floor you know like also acting and my brother he was standing next to me with two stoter so um he looked at me and he kicked me saying Joe what are you doing get up you know and um so when I came here I could freely experience the Holy Ghost you know the one thing that I really wanted was that and God afforded me that [Applause] opportunity and I think some of the experiences that I just want to share with you is you know coming out of sister chenel's classroom the classroom was right on the top here on a Tuesday I'll never forget we were fasting and praying and I looked out firstly in the morning the apostle was right here um actually kneeling at the EHR minia and he prayed saints that whole day and the anointing that filled this place I remember being so fascinated and I'm sorry but even as I think about it it's it really touches my my heart and I stood at that window and I looked down and I remember saying God as the man of God sits and lays before you may you place him on my heart on his heart and the Apostle continued to pray that entire day to witness something like that is beyond words it's beyond AC IC achievement it is beyond anything your mind can ever comprehend and I remember thinking that what kind of a man is this that he will sacrifice everything he has for us and because of that I always said God help me that I will keep the hands and arms of the man of God up [Applause] I also remember many times um sitting in the classroom and the Holy Ghost will just pour out it was lifechanging to say the least and for many reasons we can praise the school but I don't think there is a single amount of words that or accolades that that can come remotely close to the impact that the Holy Ghost has on our lives I also just you know in my day-to-day experiences here at the school I think we were privileged to see one another grow brother Glenn um we grew we made mistakes um you know as I stand here and look at the youngsters we made many mistakes but there there was one thing that really resonated with me and it's something I took from the Apostle it's the perseverance I spoke about this brother Glenn you reminded me at my matrick bank with such a simple principle perseverance diligence um Pastor Jonathan once said to me that diligence is the drive to wake up every day and Chase your vision own your destiny and I always kept that with me no matter what and as I begin to speak about academics and corporate you know uh path I really want you to remember that if God could do it for me he can do it for anyone and I I remember when the school just after we met articulated uh the Apostle called us and he wanted us to say what we were going to study and this again I mean you ask yourself on the face of this Earth what kind of school is consistently checking into this day on where their Learners are what they doing and I remember the Apostle um asking each of us we were only nine in matrick and I had U mentioned I wanted to go into education and I remember the Apostle's face he didn't say anything but he just looked at me and something in me told me that I that's not what God called me to do and I went with my passion and thankfully brother Glenn happened to have walked that road before me and so not knowing anything about accounting guys and that's why I want you to if anything take away that in this ministry The Impossible is possible it is possible so as I I matriculated I asked brother Glenn um advice I actually registered for the wrong degree and brother Glenn said to me no Joe you you need to change your degree which I did and I want to thank you brother Glen and I went on to study part-time and I was working and studying which is really hard um the values that the school instilled in us as Learners to work hard to persevere and to never give up and I say this with a reason because it took me 12 years to qualify as a chartered accountant and I woke up every day um and I wrote it on my Bridge uh when I got married one of the first things I wrote I really would I want to be a chartered accountant and at that time it was such a big dream for me in my head in my ability it was very impossible but I am so thankful that throughout my journey I was privileged enough to have the Apostle Pastor Jonathan the leadership of this church and specifically Pastor Jonathan very instrumental in guiding me throughout the journey journey and the gift in this ministry is beyond measure sense I hit the roadblock where I couldn't pass one subject and it was really difficult I told myself this is it I'm giving up and I remember saying to pastor jnan this is it I'm not I can't this is I can't go further than this Believers Pastor Jonathan actually said to me why are you answering a question like this this is how you must answer it and believe it or don't believe it it's my experience it's my testimony and you won't believe it saints that was the exact method to that subject I I did not do something [Music] else so to be found in a place where you are surrounded by God men men of God that are ordained and that have our best interest at heart is the greatest blessing I could ever asked for and I want to close by saying that yes I may have attained the ca I may have attained I attained my goal but I've also been taught don't be satisfied and so as I continue my journey journey I hope to inspire the young mind sit standing and sitting before me here and say and leave you actually with these words Pastor Jonathan once also said that um the more salt you get the thirstier you become and the more you drink and the salt are those challenges it's way when you are most weak when you can't see your way out Pastor Johnson says that's the time when you need to actually use that to own your destiny so I really want to encourage you and say today as I stand Here I Am the general manager of finance Global for a big multinational uh Health um equipment and devices company and I don't say this for my Accolade I only say this to show the power of this ministry the power of the vision of the man of [Applause] God and I want to close with this phrase Pastor Jude said in when he preached Miracles he said you have two choices you have a choice in life life where you choose to say that there are no Miracles and the other way is to say that every day is a miracle and for me today is a miracle it will always be the first day I stood at that war brother Glen was a miracle in my life and it will always be and we know also that time gives you things it's also something that Pastor Jonathan always says time gives you things and as we reflect on the 20 years I thought about it this morning brother Glenn God gave the school many many blessings many many blessings but may it not stop here may God continue to bless you bless the school bless the Learners bless our leadership and I just want to say thank you to my Apostle I want I want to salute you and I want to thank you with everything within me thank [Applause] you JY just give sister Jolene another beautiful hand the likes of sister Prudence a beautiful hand at this time I'm going to welcome brother Jal Augustine a grand son of our Apostle and the visioner of the school just to give us a synopsis on the history of the school can we just [Applause] welcoming [Applause] amen esteemed guest teachers parents and and cherished members of the AL Tabernacle Christian College family I greet you all in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it's a great honor and a privilege for me to stand in front of you this morning I also can't believe that the the school is 20 years today um at this moment I'd like to greet our Senor Pastor Jonathan Pastor Jude Pastor Edgar Jor and the Rosco family at large and in her absence Mama Sheila who touched our lives and the lives of countless students and will forever be in our hearts her dedication to the school was unmatched as you saw in the clip how she rang that Bell amen and most of all last but definitely not least I'd like to greet God's Apostle Apostle edgil [Applause] Rosco they say you truly can't Savor a meal without recognizing the chef Behind The Culinary Masterpiece they say you can't grasp the essence of a novel without recognizing the author who crafted its Pages they say you can't embrace the beauty of a garden without appreciating the hands that meticulously planted and nurtured each Blossom they say you can't truly feel the power and Grace of the sculpture without acknowledging the sculptor who skillfully chiseled life into stone so this morning before I speak to you about the history of the school allow me to acknowledge and show appreciation for the one that God gave a vision to to build a school in Walkerville this morning just allow me to show some appreciation and acknowledgement to the founder the Visionary the leader that built and shaped Al Tabernacle Christian College to what it is today Apostle Edgar Hill Rosco amen as I look back in all my Years of Living never have I found a man that is so unwavering so dedicated so hardworking so zealous for God Apostle as we look through this 20 years of Al Tabernacle Christian College we can truly say your loving was not in vain what you truly stand for an embody is found in the core and the foundation of the school never have I been with the Apostle and God is Not on his lips never have I spoken to the Apostle without wisdom stepping to the Forefront so this morning when you look at the school you know the foundation of the man that built it it was not only to educate but to save it was not built to empower only but to protect it was not only there to create professionals but to create Holy Ghost filled professionals the heart of the school is Holiness Holiness unto God so let's just take this time to salute God's Apostle for creating a god- centered environment where our children can thrive in the Holy Ghost Apostle we salute you this [Applause] morning [Applause] amen so this morning I was tasked to just give a brief synopsis of the school's history on this momentous occasion celebrating two years two de Decades of unwavering dedication and a Relentless pursuit of Excellence let me take you on a journey that began in 2005 defying the naysayers and the Skeptics who D to question our very existence the naysayers said the school will only last a year maybe two at most but Al Tabernacle it's 20 years to today by the grace of God the school is still standing amen while other pastors were playing the fool Apostle Rosco was building a school in the face of uncertainty Apostle Edgar Hil Rosco's Vision birthed not just the school but a testament to the miraculous power of faith and vision from the the decision to start grade R to 12 simultaneously in 2005 to the groundbreaking achievements of our first grade 12 class of 05 securing 100% pass rate Al Tabernacle set the stage for a legacy of Triumph Against All Odds a paradox the school achieved numerous 100% Pass rates in grade 12 multiple distinctions and Bachelor passes throughout the 20 years I've also been so privileged to count myself amongst the L Tabernacle alumni I started in grade one in 2005 and so happens that my grade one teacher is here today amen and I matriculated teacher IRA and I matriculated in 2016 and like I heard prudy said you only realize something when it's gone amen and I must say you realize the impact of the school once you walk out those doors you just feel and know you cut from a different piece of cloth amen and that leaves an indelible Mark in your life that can't be erased in 2016 we embrac the future with open arms ushering in a digital era of teaching and learning the introduction of tablets not only revolutionized education but became our Lifeline during the unprecedented challenge of covid-19 showcasing the foresight that defines our institution our graduates now scattered across diverse Fields many of medical doctors mechanical engineers electrical engineers Advocates teachers numerous qualifications in the biomed and forensic field Chartered Accountants investment bankers and bom graduates Galore are living embodiment of Excellence master's degrees have been earned distinctions celebrated one of our students achieved distinctions in all his subjects in grade 12 and the spirit of Al Tabernacle is imprinted in each and every success story amen yet beyond the academic accolades our journey is etched with divine intervention the spiritual front of Al Tabernacle is unparalleled across the 20 years over a thousand Learners baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ students enveloped in the presence of the Holy Ghost the school as a scent of Outreach is unmatched True Discipleship is to bring someone into the presence of the Holy Ghost the school fulfills that quote the school helped many Learners in their spiritual walk one just needs to listen to the ex pupils testifying proudly about the AL Tabernacle Christian College Heritage to scratch the surface of what Al Tabernacle Christian college has done with our walk in Christ as you heard prudy and Jolene they only scratch the surface of what Al Tabernacle Christian College done in our spiritual walk in the ground tapestry of apostle Rosco's Ministry the spiritual achievements of this institution stands as The Pinacle of what the school stands for a testament that Faith perseverance and divine grace not only sustained us but propelled us to become a beacon of inspiration so as we look back at the past 20 years let us remember

bless are you happy to be here the greatest Miracle is the building you standing in to have attained this building 20 years ago is a miracle then to have the church in this building is also a miracle and then to have the visioner of this great building and this church is a miracle and to have a school around this building just the brick work alone is a miracle that had to be built and then to build a school in the building there two different aspects is also a miracle and then to still have it standing after 20 years is even a greater [Music] Maro I um must say that during the time of Co we really went through a hard patch with the school and the man of God never wavered or said anything we thought we're going to hit a bad spot but we survived Co we survived low student turnout and right now we sitting here in this Tabernacle with the opening of the school which is a supernatural school there's lot of schools but to have a supernatural one it's an honor to see it with your eyes this is a miracle Upon A Miracle on upon a miracle and I realized you can leave the school you can finish your career you can leave the school but the school won't leave [Music] you it's a school of academic achievements and the spiritual achievements cannot be compared to anything that you know or that anybody knows we want to thank the teachers that has been here for 20 years I just want to give them they also a [Music] miracle they are great Mir I think you can give them [Music] a I saw brother Glenn very emotional to see his ex- students but he's not supposed to focus on the ex students he must focus on the current students at because what we did for them we have to do for these that has come amen and even more amen want to welcome all the parents all the EX matriculant may God bless you I will not be a long time is going on and we still have some speakers behind me amen so I like to read the scripture just say something and then we'll go on because we can be here the whole day and still not get to the bottom of it all amen um the Book of Genesis 28 I want you to remember that December was a great convention the Apostle preached a very great sermon here for the two meetings but then I realized that the church was before the school so that 20th convention we had here with what the Apostle preached made I have a jubilee as Al Tabernacle not the school just Al Tabernacle 20 years in this building was also a great miracle today is the follow on of their 20 years I don't know if you with me this morning oh it looks like you forgot that there was a convention and you forgot what was preached there was nothing ever preached like what was preached at our 20th year and I thank God that I was here to hear it and you were here to hear it now the scripture I'm reading is just in light of what we are seeing here Genesis 2811 and he lightened upon a certain place so there's lot of places but there is a certain place and I want you to know and tell the one next to you this is a certain place it's not any place it's a certain place L Tabernacle is not any place you bringing your child to the school it's not any place it's a certain place it's a put out Place ordained by God so we are standing in a certain place you didn't come here by accident God brought you to a certain place this building was built because it's a special place there is no other place like this certain place called Al tacle you are standing in a certain place out of all the places you know this is the certain place it is even better than the house you live in this is a certain place this place is ordained of God for the time we're living in so you don't know and I don't know but this is God's certain place it's a special place of worship you cannot worship ship God anywhere you need to find the certain [Music] place are you in the certain place I want to ask you how did you get here did you plan it did you work it out God brought you to the certain place this eighth Road God put out before the foundation for you you see how those ex matriculant were singing and dancing and being in the spirit they had to all come and leave where they were to the certain [Applause] place and he tered all night because the sun was setting and he took stones of that place and made it his pillow for 20 years we made this our pillow we made this place our resting place we made this place a place where we say I'll rather be a doormat in Al Tabernacle than to be sitting at [Music] home this is a certain place and this is a place where we can rest and have a Sabbath and a rest and and he laid down in the place to sleep and the Bible says he dreamed the dream and I realized we all were in this dream of Al Tabernacle and I want to ask you my brother my sister since we in the school and in L Tabernacle don't wake me up from Hall this dream Don't Wake Me Up To See God moving every week every Sunday every Wednesday I don't want to be woken up because this dream is a wonderful dream called Al Tabernacle why it's a certain [Music] place it's a beautiful place it's a place where you can feel God it's a place where you hear God and it's a place where you can see God this is the miracle of this place don't wake up because the dream we're having here is been fulfilled in front of our [Music] eyes we always says where is God and where's the right church and is there a place where you can meet God I want you to know you in that place and some of you have been here for 20 years is and still you need to be convinced that this is the [Music] place oh but I want to tell Lucifer I want to tell our critics I want to tell all the court cases where to go to I want to tell the old Midville Council this is still the [Music] place we had to go to the high court but this is still the place they wanted to close the school but this is the place there is no place like Al [Music] Tabernacle and why do I say so open your eyes and look it's still happening after 20 years just look I want you to look look around you no you're not you you're not doing what I'm telling you open your eyes look around you and tell you we still here and we still in the place let's give a lord of [Music] shabat oh my brother my sister you know sometimes you got to wait 20 years sometimes to see the miracle but I saw every year a miracle and you know where was that Miracle on the stage every year there was a miracle a some child made it through and they still in the place they finished school but they still here and their children is here and their parents is here why it's the [Music] place don't look for another place we found the place we found God we found a letter and God on top of the letter and God has come down here every time not one s not one cent that we spent to build the place and not one cent that we spent in 20 years can match one of the souls not one Soul could be bought with all the money we spent it was worth it all I want you to give the Lord a Shabbat I want you to jump where you are standing I want you to scream to the Lord show the devil and tell the devil th th th th th is the place why because God has a man in this place God bless you h oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] he [Music] h [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] amen as you welcome our Apostle this [Music] [Music] morning [Music] give me just raise [Music] our because because [Music] he how I love [Music] J oh how I love [Applause] J How I Love Jesus give [Music] our love to [Applause] be he is so he is so wonderful [Music] to he is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so J Love [Applause] [Music] that reminded me of the night of nights when I met the greatest man that ever [Music] loved the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ they [Music] sang the song and it was like a brand new song oh how I love [Music] Jesus from that moment I have never lost my [Music] love for Jesus king God [Music] we um greet you in his wonderful name I need to apologize I I see everybody's got Ties on and suit on and and the founder of this Bolding in this organism you know looks like this but I've got the colors [Music] [Applause] on so um I thought we just going to sit around and and um and celebrate it cannot be rubbed out it cannot be brushed underneath the table neither can it be ridiculed that this could have only been [Music] [Applause] God for a black man like me to have had a vision like this is unheard heard of a vision that don't end here a vision that's growing as the years flies by it'll go into [Music] eternity because there people that decided young people that come to this school that has decided that they're not going to die the death of an unrighteous that Vision has gone far beyond the grave to the other side of the Ring where the king of glory is waiting for them therefore we didn't have a vision like Mandela had for the put South Africa South Africa that's been cursed by the Jews and the curse is short coming you'll hear tonight what I have to say I'll rather be a Zimbabwean now than to be a South African because a curse is thrown over us whosoever curs Israel God said they will be cursed amen so your vision is not for a struggle I mean we've been in the struggle I've been in the struggle and we thought that the ANC is going to take the struggle away but I'm in a worse struggle now than when I ever was before I'm still struggling therefore these kids hasn't had a vision of thec and Mandela they have a vision of [Applause] Jesus we are not Muslims and we're not Jewish we don't follow mammad to Muhammad and we don't follow Moses we follow the greatest man that ever lived and his name is Jesus and that's what we bow the school on yes sir and that's what we're going to fight for and that's why we're going to stand for the time we have down here might not be very long so I'm sorry that I I look like this casual and uh but it's not the clothes that makes you something what in [Applause] here so may God Rich you bless you you know there's nothing you can do against fruit I don't have to say anything yeah I mean it's been displayed what this is all [Applause] about you don't have to guess what fruit is here you can see it with your own eyes you want to know who somebody is if you want to know who somebody is don't look on how popular he is and all that look at his [Applause] fruit if he steals money and bankrupt a country then what fruit did he bring he stole and fruit is stealing and sto stealing so our fruit will carry on I'm so happy when I saw the ex great 12 a whole church do you know a much [Applause] that act grade 12 as doctors and lawyers and just what you saw yeah and you want to tell me that's not fruit the school has proven itself and that's only the natural side the spiritual side over the the Christmas weekend at our convention was the greatest time I had for my 57th years of serving God in a Ministry that God could give me the keys Stone Revelation in the spiritual realm there has never been messages preached like what was preached over that [Applause] weekend we could clearly and honestly say and I I make no bones about it because I think my job is done yes that we have angels in [Applause] attendance and for the people that had trusted me when I opened the school some of your children is here and they have children now you saw them up here they were children but now they mothers and they they fathers they got children your investment has come to the for today to show you the money you spent it's not worth one of these Souls that was on the spit [Applause] for so it is one of the greatest things that could ever happen in South [Applause] Africa so I just got a few comments to make and uh I don't have to talk you know talk becomes very cheap when you see things like this because the fruit overwhelms it the proof of the pudding is in the eating I only realize after many years what a school entails the beginning of a plant or a seed in the hearts of a child to prepare him for the future the beginning is the school where you plant that seed and that seed is actually there for the future of that child what that child is going to be in the future you planted it right here the mothers and the fathers only have a couple of hours with a child but the teachers is there all the time with a child planting sees either of discrepancy or seeds of Eternity we made it sure that you're not going to have an educated sinner well educated but morals gone we made sure that they're going to be educated but they will have models that no other school will [Applause] have we make sure that what we planted we won't be sorry tomorrow when we see the fruit coming standing here after 20 years I planted that seed way back there with the teachers that was with us and after 20 h I can stand right here now and see the fruit that that seed is producing amen and here they are the husband and the wife come from the school and they are married and they brought for children and that children that they brought forth will be exactly the way they are because the seed don't change if it's a apple it's a apple if it's a pear it's a pear it's a bring forth after its kind and these little guys here has seen today what God has planted 20 years ago May that seed go into them and they do the same thing and become the same fruit of that very very teaching of the [Applause] teachers I wouldn't topel the fight that we had because in intimity I was going to read two verse 15 study to show thyself a proof and that's what we told them study study and here we had on the platform people that took that little bit they studied to show themselves approv today they can take out their certificates and say I'm this and I'm that and I'm that why they studied to show them themselves approved right here today in front of your eyes I am this now and I am that now and I am that now they are proven testimonies of the seed that we [Applause] [Music] [Applause] planted and as I said it didn't go without a fight we had to fight through it I thought Lord how are we going to make it in the covered because the school was closed and we still paid the teachers while they weren't teaching for 2 years now who carried us through not this way there's somebody that's supporting the cause from heaven and we didn't skip one month to pay the teachers and that was in the critical times that was in the bad times that was in the times when we were in the boom backs that God still come behind us and say man it is enough money to pay them and I'm sure that if there's anything ahead of ush that he wants the school if he didn't want the school it had to be closed down but he wants the school and the school will go from strength to strength uh from Victory to Victory from overcoming to overcoming and we'll fight for [Applause] it I will say that we had hard time because you can only judge the good times through the hard times I like what my old sister used to tell me says Edgar when you hit the devil hard watch how hard he's going to hit you then you know whether you're hurting and I'm sure today he hurt because they gave us one year that school only last one [Applause] year uhh it's not what he said it's not what he [Applause] said I'll admit that there was times that we felt like throwing in the towel and those were the times when the plun needed to be pruned so to cut off we to cut off here and cut off there so that the main thing can grow and friends we cut off if we have to cut off we cut off because we know when you cut and you prune more fruit will come after that and because of our cutting more fruit comes from there I will stand here if I have to cut or cut if I have to prune that seed I'll prune it if I have to get rid of the dry Twigs I'm going to get rid of the dry Twigs because I need a living twig uh because the Twigs must love uh I shall not die but I shall love to praise the Lord [Applause] amen and you know after the Twigs was cut off and the dried Twigs was gone I see the people dancing in front you and now you little boys here look at them did you see how they worship they already had that seed in them Hallelujah said hey I must go down and praise the Lord I am not here because of me there's somebody within me that's holding the rain there's something within me I cannot explain there's something within me that gives me strength to carry [Applause] [Music] on so the hard times was the times we went through the wall of critics we were boycotted from all the churches but we carried on we were in the Hall of [Applause] critics but now we out in a Hall of [Applause] Fame now our Fame is growing that even other schools wants to steal our teachers that's the worst thing when you become famous they offer your teachers something better there is no something better than elet because here you have the spiritual side which no school has the spiritual [Applause] side you have god with you and you have education with you how can you lose you can't [Applause] lose I'm glad for God for the job he gave me he he pays me amen and he makes me win souls hallu where can I get a better job than that I'm not leaving this job even if Raposa said he's a Hamas I'm a Hamas you be a h is your business ra but me I'm a Christian I belong to Jesus [Applause] amen it was sure a vision but a vision without hardship without hard work that tries to block it from happening is there no vision you can have a vision is good but a vision is fought because the devil don't want that thing to be made manifest it's going to be critical against his kingdom yeah when the prophet says Jesus will be born they killed all the young children BOS said they kill the young they kill they always kill the young children when Israel was in Egypt did they kill the young children because that young child if he don't have the right seed will grow up a terrorist so kill him while he's young kill the thing they've been killing children all the time through the Bible so therefore we thank God that hardships goes with a vision you can only know a great vision if you see how many hardships you had to fight boy did we fight hardships the government came along and says well we'll give you 200,000 a month but then we have half of what you got anything in a school half belongs to and that's not even the wages we pay and I said man it would have been a help but I do not want the government in here and for 20 years no government funds NOC funds no Raposa funds is in L Tabernacle this thing is funded by the kingdom of heaven [Applause] [Music] [Applause] 20 years is a lifetime when they say they're giving you life and that's 20 years and up it's a lifetime so there's some people here that gave up their lives to make this a success what I like about a vision God gives you a vision before the foundation of the world but he gives you people that will help you to fulfill that Vision you never know why you had to go and go study to become a teacher but God knew he watches watches you he says I want you in my school I want you to be a teacher in my school I want you not only to bring education and bige headedness I want you to bring amen Holy Ghost educated uh angels of God uh so I'm going to direct you here's my sister from Zimbabwe amen amen God directed her she had to come through Amen to South Africa she can't understand it but I think now she understands it she had to come here and support the vision amen and keep the hands up uh that tries his best uh to bring forth a school uh that is actually the best school in in the south [Applause] oh my oh my oh why he always raises up wonderful workers for his ministers and do we have wonderful teachers [Applause] and I assure you the schol is going from strength to strength because in my bones there's no relaxing Hallelujah in my bones is is I'm never [Applause] satisfied we will go on [Applause] improving and let the dogs bark they bark on this side they bark on this side but the Caravan is moving Al tabacal Christian College is moving [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know in hard times you have no support because failure is a lonely orphan nobody likes failure it's too lonely to be in a group that fails but in that hardship you find people that's got H they don't look here they look down there and down there there's a light in the [Applause] tunnel and I thank God for these teachers that Jonathan than that stood with us in the hard times anybody can come to a nice Church anybody can come to a nice school when everything is nice and all the problems is solved but nobody comes to a place where there's problems and heartaches it take Faith than inivision to be able to stand and see the thing through and I thank you for standing with us in the time of trouble and in the time of me I had had my back covered and today I can for sure say just what you saw on this platform a whole church a whole church came out of the school worshiping God being born again having the peace of God in their hearts amen and having one thing in their mind is to serve God and serve God only and the young people that shows the old people that hey we have found the price uh the pearl of great price and we're not turning back amen we are holding fast uh we have saw the vision uh and we are following the vision uh and we get Victory through the vision uh and the vision will see us through and boy God God Amen isn't the Sur Vision look around you isn't the a vision they say are you going to build a church like this you're a colored man or you're a black man where are you going to find the money only a white man can do this no my brother I've been in the conference of God I've been in the presence of God and he said P it [Applause] [Music] and here you [Applause] are and it's just growing and growing so thank you very much it's so nice to have worked with you for these many many years how many 100% passes did we have JL rolled it out so apply and so good and today even the schools outside says there is no models as good as the children that comes from El Tabernacle I want to say this in closing sometimes I walk the shopping malls and as I walk I just see somebody runs up to me Apostle Apostle T I don't know there there's too many people in L Tabernacle I'm so glad that uh we can call one another brother and sister and not names you understand because I'll never be able to know all the names I was walking there pushing the groceries in the trolley and this guy said to me uh hang on Pastor hang on I'll push this trolley for you and then uh I hang on

says uh All My Children went to school at your school which is the best school in all of South [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] AF and my heart jumped within me if she didn't watch me out of dance because there's a testimony there there and it could never ever happen if God didn't direct you teachers footsteps to this place to make it [Music] happen I was saying in Victoria I appreciate

[Music] okay and I and I love my [Music] work I just I just love this job 36 years I'm doing this job and I still love it and if there's another 36 years I don't know amen I just love it this morning I I I sure didn't have much time with this message I I forgot to look at the program and brother Paul phoned me Friday night and then uh uh I had the wedding and what have you so u i um had to jump in quickly and draw this up and um I pray that you pray for me that God would bless it amen amen and uh as you know now that uh these videos goes all over and I cannot take no chances so um I have to make double sure because there might be a soul in stake somewhere and it'll help that soul and uh when I get over there I don't want to be empty-handed you know I want want some souls to my name [Music] amen if I should entitle this message I'd entitle it cometh the hour cometh the man cometh the hour then cometh the man in every hour that God has predestinated for anything to happen you'll have a man to go with it so come at the hour cometh the man and I would like to take my thought from this quotation that I gave you Church Ages page 246 and that's the reason I wrote those scriptures they cried Hosanna hosana because that was the hour and that was the man [Applause] but in the case of Luther God's time was ripe come of the hour for a definite move he says but in the time of Luther the man God's time was right right the hour for a definite move that that would be the beginning of the restoration when the hour came God had the man and God don't work any other way that's the only way God works and he doesn't break his pattern when the hour comes God will have the right man at that hour to do the work that heaven can do only he says in Luther God's got a man then God's time was right for justification so cometh the hour so cometh the man if the hour hour comes then it's automatically God has the man [Music] [Applause] automatically God has the man when the hour comes amen because we can only serve God through a representative there is no other way that you can serve God you have to make sure that you get the representative and that representative is proven by God and that's the only way that we can serve God Amen is by that representative if you do not accept the representative then you do not accept God because that is the ambassador of Heaven to you and when you you don't accept that Ambassador you cannot be saved and I want to say this this morning if God has an ambassador in this hour and that's the only way that God is going to work through God is going to lift up that Ambassador God is going to show everybody that that Ambassador is the right Ambassador because cometh the hour cometh the man amen if the hour is here the man must be there [Applause] Hallelujah because we can only serve God through a representative amen and Jesus said in St John 20:21 he says as the father sent me so send I you amen praise God God did not not only send me Jesus Christ but God send me amen so that I can send you to be an ambassador at the right hour at the right time this is my time now because the father sent me but there's coming a time where the father's going to send you to be ambassadors and workers for the kingdom of God for when the hour comes amen the man cometh to amen you can't have the hour outside of the man if the hour is here the man is here for I send you Hallelujah to preach the gospel and raise the dead amen [Music] [Applause] hallelujah as the father sent me so send I you amen how did the father send him to preach Deliverance Amen to bring the Holy Ghost Terry he in Jerusalem until you endured with power from on high amen and brother Here We Are Tonight today we are in the same same commission that Jesus Christ had because he sent us amen and when you receive us you receive him and when you receive him you receive his kingdom and when you receive his kingdom you receive the Holy Ghost and when you receive the Holy Ghost you receive the comforter and when you receive the comforter you receive the Dove and when you receive the dove amen it leads you into the promise of God [Applause] hallelujah and when God send that man man he is never received he is never never received cometh the hour cometh the man but the man never gets received amen everybody will be against him everybody will speak against him when Jesus Christ came they couldn't receive him amen they call him a wine Bubba they call him a glonous amen they call him a a man that's born out of wedlock amen they didn't like him they call him babab amen the king of the Devils but cometh the hour cometh the man God send him and there's nothing nobody can do amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah they didn't receive him they rejected him they criticized him the Pharisees was against him the churches was against him amen the preachers was against him but God didn't change his mind because they were against him because this was God's Ambassador this was God's representation upon the Earth and God stood with him amen because cometh the hour cometh the man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah and if the man is there he's never received why a prophet is not known in his own country Matthew 13 verse 57 a prophet is not known in his own country and if God send a Prophet uh and God a prophet is a new testament preacher even in this message they won't receive him because he's not known amen they just look at him and says well that's so and so and that's so and so because he's not accepted if they accept him that churches will be empty if they say that that man has the word of God that churches will be empty so they've got to be against him amen jealousy comes up in them because God gave the man a gift amen and that gift is without doubt amen that that's the hour and that's the man cometh the hour cometh the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] man and Jesus said amen in Luke 23:31 he says if they have done this to a green tree how much more shouldn't they do that to a dry tree amen if they done that to me they will do it to them that I sent to amen and brother I'm so glad that I'm one of the ministers that can say they did it to me but here I stand because cometh the hour cometh the man and there's nothing nobody can do about that God in heaven will back up that man regardless of how many split away from him cometh the hour cometh the [Music] [Applause] man [Applause] [Music] if he is accepted then he's not the man if he is accepted then it has broken every scripture amen why because every time God has a man he's rejected everybody that likees likes him that's a bad sign amen it's a bad bad sign if everybody likes that man that's a bad sign that's not the man because right through in the word of God they hated the prophets they killed the prophets amen but how could you be a man of God and everybody loves you it can't be that way amen when they even hated your God Amen they even spoke bad about your God how much more shouldn't they speak bad about you that's a true sign that you are not called that's a true sign that God never called you look for a man amen that everybody hates uh everybody speaks against everybody loves to love to hate him that's the man and that's a good sign [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] that's a bad sign if everybody loves him amen because the word of God says for so persecuted they the prophets which were before them in Matthew 5:12 so persecuted they the prophets amen that was before them they hated the prophets because a prophet amen don't compromise a prophet amen will tell you Black is Black and white is white amen a prophet puts the thing down amen a prophet is somebody that speaks God's mind and not the people's mind and not the preachers mind and not the church's mind and not that up and Up's mind they speak the mind of God and what God wants amen so persecuted they the [Applause] prophets [Applause] he says in Matthew 23:29 you build the tombs of the prophets and gares the seul of the righteous not only the prophets but even the righteous not only do they kill the prophets but the righteous that comes behind the prophet and say exactly what the prophet said they like to kill him they like to garnish his tomb when he dies then he want to say what a great man and amen he had a give brother they garnish the tombs of the righteous the man the man he's always rejected evil spoken of criticized hey man but whenever they criticize him God just blesses him all [Applause] that's one of the true signs one of the true signs that he is the man of God Amen when they reject him and criticize him and look fault in him that's a true sign one of the true signs the other sign is amen he always tries to run away from the job when they try to choose him he runs away that's another sign then he sticks to the word of God that's another sign then he anoints the word of God that's another sign then he lives the sermon that he preached that's another sign then he has three pools in his life healing preaching amen and speak the word and it manifest itself amen then you have the man then you have the man then you have the man Hallelujah then you have the Mind [Applause] Glory Jesus Jesus had three pools in his life amen he three steps in his life and in his ministry his first step he came and he healed the sick his second step was he preached the word of God and they hated him for it his third step was was he went down into hell and preached to the prisons to the people that was lost here at three pools and every man that is called of God must have three pools in his life not only preaching he must have a gift of healing not only healing he must speak the word only and it must go out like Thunderbolts of lightning then you have the man then you have the man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] don't only look for a man that preach one sermon and then you fall for him no brother amen he must preach every time the Holy Ghost must be there amen he must heal the sick through the power of a Mighty God he must be an ambassador on the earth he must LIF the life amen praise God Amen then we have the man that's the man you got to look for don't give your soul over to anything else he must have his qualities he must have the Holy Ghost he must have the word he must have signs wonders and miracles he must have the three pools amen then you have found the man then you have found God dark [Applause] man come of the Hour come the [Music] [Applause] man and you know what brother every man that follows a man like that is hated the people that follows him is hated amen oh do you go are you by brother so and so's Church oh we know him amen they don't like you why because you have met the man Hallelujah you have had met the man that has the qualities amen that the word of God said you have amen hallelujah because if you work against Power you'll burn amen when you work against Power you burn when you take the wrong wires and you connect it and you switch it on it'll blow up amen because you're working against power but when you work with power the lights goes on and when you work with the power of God in a God man there is God man man that's trained by God God trained man but this is the hour and there must be man that's train Hallelujah to take the word of God further Hallelujah and there must be Believers that stands behind the man same and [Applause] [Music] somebody [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in Luther's day somewhere in the 15th century in the late 14th century yeah many came before him protesting the Roman Catholic Church many came before Luther and they protesting protested against the Roman Catholic church in Church Ages page 254 God raised up many Mighty Men of which Luther was one but one Calvin and and swing swingley were two other luminaries and beside these were many many more who are not so well known many many more more amen was there with Luther and they protested the Roman Catholic Church God will have men with these God men that will go out and protest against the wrong thing whether they like it or whether they don't amen there will be men that will stand with a man of God if that is the hour that is the man and there will be man that will preach exactly what that man says amen and they'll stand under promises uh what that man has stood on Amen and they will not Sherk uh they will not be pulled back they will not be ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen they will stand therefore because cometh the hour cometh a [Applause] man many helpers will come when the real man is there they'll just feel to do something for God they know that this is God's path and they want to be in it and they want their names written too and they want other names written next to their names and they'll go out amen as workers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ you workers that go out amen amen God put that in your heart it doesn't come from you it comes from God Amen [Music] [Applause] many a men many of men came before Luther amen and they started the split from the Roman Catholic church but in Luther the split actually came they only caused the trem but Luther got brought the earthquake amen they were men that preach exactly what Luther preached they stood what Luther stood for but they couldn't bring a Reformation they couldn't bring the split from the Roman Catholic church amen why because it was in the hour and they were in the man Calvin and zwingley and Hassam amen they preached the way Luther preached they stood on the things Luther stood they protested against the Roman Catholic church but that was not the hour and they were not the man but when the hour came H amen cometh the hour cometh the man Luther Step Up amen and shook the Roman Catholic Church as he thundered against the Roman Catholic church because he was the man and he was in the hour amen and brother we are in the hour and we have the [Music] man we have the man 54 Ministry [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] man [Applause] they split the Roman Catholic Church they broke away from the Roman Catholic church because of Luther God anointed Luther God gave him the power to split the church without them killing him because one of those uh reformers said one day a goose will come that you won't be able to kill and he was prophesying about Luther and when Luther came it was the hour they couldn't kill this go amen they killed everybody else but they couldn't kill him why because cometh the hour cometh the man and not even a pope could get rid of him not even clever man could get rid of him not even teachers could get rid of him because cometh the hour sister Judith cometh the man they can't get rid of him until God is finished with him [Applause] they split away from the Roman Catholic church because there was a new age coming the only time that you can split if there's a new age if there's another messenger if there's another message amen then you can leave the old message and go into the new message but amen between amen 1520 and 1750 in the sad Church age amen while you've been in the sadan church age under the anointing of uh of Martin Luther if you split there you lost you lost amen there's no way you can be saved because that's the move of God Amen there's where God was moving and God wasn't going to move with anybody else but with Luther amen so if you wanted to split from him God cut you off amen because that is the age that is the hour and that is the man you lost if you do [Applause] [Music] that God was busy with justification and nothing else nothing else even if somebody says well I I feel now you got to be Sanctified amen it's not time for sanctification it's time for justification for the just shall live by faith [Applause] Hallelujah that was the new message and there's where God was roaming around especially in this age of Brotherly kindness this age of

different the spirit of God says different uh the Bible says in Ephesians 4:11 amen Apostles prophets pastors evangelists teaches after me and this is the major prophet that said this amen this is an apostle that's bigger than our Prophet because he was not only a prophet he was an apostle and he was not only an apostle he was an elder and he was not only an elder he set with the 24 Elders he's the greatest of them all outside of Jesus [Applause] Hallelujah and he said and he said Ephesians 4 After I'm Gone amen there will come Apostles and there will come prophets H and there will come

holy ghost in a man Hallelujah that's God's representative whether you like it or not that's thus sayeth the Lord and I'm soad glad that I packed the Holy Ghost amen and I preached the Holy Ghost and I gave out the Holy Ghost and that's God's Representative no other representative for work but that representative Hallelujah today is the Holy Ghost a thing that really hurt me for many many years and you must have heard about it many times when I heard that the Pentecostal says you know you in that message you have the word but you don't have the spirit it hurt me for years and years and as I went right around the world in the message I found it to be the truth and I'm truthful in front of God I cannot lie behind the pulpit I found the church is dead dry and sty and all it's word word word word word I couldn't say it's not so because I do not know whether they visited any any church in the message and that's the reason they came up with it and it hurt me it hurt me so very much that I said oh God what's going on I know these people is talking the truth and I know that your Prophet said Lord there must be a feeling in itth Amen in uncertain sounds there must be a feeling in itth and I said oh God I know that the prophet said that this message takes us back to the Holy Ghost and Lord the only sign that I know that I'm in the message if my heart is turned back to the Pentecostal fathers then I'll only know that I'm in the message Lord and brother amen I thank God while God knew my heart and I was sulking and I was waiting for God then came 79 the hour amen and then cometh the

[Music] Amen. It's good to be here this morning [Music] to give God the honor and the praises &gt;&gt; for what he's done. &gt;&gt; We are so glad to be here. Pastor John the Apostle [Applause] [Applause] apostle wanted to be here this morning and um we thank God that we could be here. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you happy this morning? [Applause] &gt;&gt; We've come to fill up our vessels. Amen. picking up our cups &gt;&gt; because that's what we have need of &gt;&gt; in this later hour. &gt;&gt; We just want more of the oil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because it's the requirement of today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You want to say, Lord, we're not going to give our oil away. &gt;&gt; It's the most important thing to us &gt;&gt; for this day and this our way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we have need of. Amen. If you have your Bibles this morning, &gt;&gt; did you enjoy the singing? Don't you appreciate the the choir musicians? [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's what we want. We want oil in our lamps. Amen. To keep us burning &gt;&gt; till the break of day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Can we turn to um Matthew 6 verse 8, [Music] Revelation Ians 3 verse 17. Amen. If you got Matthew 6 verse 8, it says, well, let's read from verse 7. But when you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathens do, for they think that they shall be heard, for them much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He already knows what you have need of before you ask him &gt;&gt; because he's your father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are people that's needy &gt;&gt; of him. &gt;&gt; That's why that song says he looked beyond my faults. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he saw my needs. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] And uh Revelations 3:17 says, \"Because thou sayest, I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing. And knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.\" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated this morning just for a few minutes. [Music] I think the worst thing that God can hear come out of our mouths is we have need of nothing. Amen. The Leodian church age told God that we have need of nothing. And yet God says you are miserable. You are naked. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You are wretched. You're poor. You are blind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you say you have need of nothing. &gt;&gt; But God knew that they had need &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; of all these things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brham says in the exposition of the seven church ages, I have need of nothing. Now when anybody says I have need of nothing, he could very well be saying I have everything. When you say you have need of nothing, you're actually saying I have everything. Or he could be saying I don't want anymore as I'm full. Now you can express this any way you want and it all adds up to the fact that the church is complacent. &gt;&gt; She is satisfied with what she has. She either figures she has it all or has enough. And that is exactly what we find today. Amen. They feel they have it. Amen. That's why those foolish virgins slept because they felt they never needed any oil. &gt;&gt; But I thank God. God will have people that says, \"Lord, I need more.\" [Applause] &gt;&gt; David wasn't satisfied with the full cup. He wanted his cup to overflow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Amen. And I think that's the worst thing you can tell God is I have everything. I don't need anymore. But Lord, we want to say we need more oil. Amen. With this oil, [Applause] we so scarce and you can't find it. There's only a little bit left. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we I thank God for health tabernacle. I thank God for a ministry &gt;&gt; that's not satisfied. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We know God, we have need of you. &gt;&gt; We want more of you. &gt;&gt; We want more of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We want it on a Wednesday. We want it on a Monday. We want it on a Tuesday. We want it every day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We want the oil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to be complacent. Amen. We don't want to be satisfied. We don't want to say we have enough. &gt;&gt; But we want to say, God, we want more. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; We definitely need more. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The brother Brandon says, \"Hallelujah. The God of this evil age.\" So God be with you. I'm sure that there's one that will be with you. That's Jesus Christ. And he can be. He's the only person that's omnipresent. And he's also omnipotent. So he can supply your every need. And omniscience also knows your need. Ne needs of what you have need of. So he knows because he's omnicient. He knows all things. &gt;&gt; So he knows what tabernacle has need of. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's only present. Hallelujah. And he can supply every need. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says the God who is rich in mercy. All that I I'm all that I ever hoped to be, I have derived from his grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; I was wretched. I was miserable. I was poor. I was blind. &gt;&gt; But by grace, he has healed me. &gt;&gt; And I'm strong and healthy. &gt;&gt; By the grace of God, I have got eyesight. I have eat, drink, I have whatever I have need of. &gt;&gt; He never promised to supply my wants. &gt;&gt; But he promised to supply my needs. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He will supply your need, not your wants. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He promised it and he's more than able to give it to us. Amen. He says in the fallen a part of the world and they prayed for a Messiah. They prayed for a messiah. &gt;&gt; But here's what I want to say. If he would come, would we receive him or would we do like they did? &gt;&gt; Would we refuse him? &gt;&gt; Do we know what we really need? Sometimes we want pray for our desires. &gt;&gt; And sometimes our desires is not our need. We must realize that we do not understand what we need. We think we do, but God promised to supply our needs. And that he'll do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll do that. &gt;&gt; But sometimes you will pray for your desires. You pray for your wants, but God will supply your every need. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He won't supply your wants, but he will supply your needs. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says in the exposition of the seven church ages, there are those who would not take the Holy Spirit. They won't take the Holy Spirit. If God opened the heavens and showed them them, showed them a sign that it's time for them to take the Holy Ghost. Even if God shows them a sign, they won't take the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, they all they are all saying and trying to prove that they have it all. They tried to prove out there that they have it all. They got the word. They got this. They got that. &gt;&gt; But we realize, amen, that they don't have everything. &gt;&gt; Or they have enough. They say they have enough. Yet, is that the truth? Compare this 20th century church to the first century church. Go ahead, do that. Where is the power? Where's the love? Where is the purifying church that withtood sin and walked with faith toward Jesus? Where is the unity? You can't find it. If this church has it all it has all it needs, why were they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts? &gt;&gt; Though they didn't have it all, and yet they had far more than they have today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Acts had far more than what the church has today, but they cried out for more. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They say they have it all, but the book of Acts. Amen. He said, \"Lord, we don't have enough. &gt;&gt; We want more.\" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tell them that I've come to tell you this day that there is more of God. If you want more or need more of God, there is more of God. Amen. Hallelujah. Don't be satisfied. Don't be satisfied. Say, \"Lord, I need more. I need more. I need more. I need more.\" Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I need more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I need more. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says in where has thy strength gone Samson? You little seminar vitamin fed seminary born rooster. Do you only know you heading for the frying pan? Amen. That rooster is heading for the frying pan. Well, what in the world are you crowing about? See, what you need today is the good old-fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost to preach to preach the people eternal life in Christ. For he lives just the same today as he was then. What good does pretty feathers and intellectuals getting them little pallets all dressed out here and things like that? Do you realize you're heading for the pan? And how many people is heading for the flying pen? The feathers are nice. They're intellectuals, but they're heading for the flying pen. Amen. What good does it do? What's all your intellect going to amount to? What we need today? What we need today is get away from the kind of stuff and back to the Holy Ghost. Back to the power of God. Back to the oldfashioned meetings. Back to the all nighting meetings. Praying and staying at self. That's what we need. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe church? That's what we need today is more of God. Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Can you say hallelujah? [Applause] &gt;&gt; They say we don't need it, but the al tabernacle says we want it. Amen. If you don't need it, we want it. Amen. We don't want intellectual speeches. We want the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. We don't want just the lamp, but we want oil in the lamp. The baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. We want Hallelujah. Because we need it more than ever before. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm just going to run through it and I'm going to give over to Pastor John. Amen. &gt;&gt; What What do you have need of? You don't need a motor car. You don't need a house. You don't need new clothes. You don't need anything. Hallelujah. Amen. What you need for today? What do you need for today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We want to say like the apostle says, we need oil for today. We need the Holy Ghost for today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They cut it off, but we want to say we need it. Amen. Hallelujah. We need it more than ever before. [Applause] Let us hear what the prophet says. What will they need for today? Let's hear what our prophet says, what we need for today. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm just going to concise it out of all his sermons. What he says, what we need for today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham says in the token, what we need today, what we need today. Hallelujah. Not what we need yesterday, but what we need today. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is another baptism of the Holy Spirit and have the real power of God that identifies the works that Jesus Christ promised for this day. Not so much as that day, but this day. The promise that he made here. That was his promise here. He would pour out his spirit. Now he has promised it again in the last days. And what he would do. Amen. And that's what we need today. &gt;&gt; He says in perseverance, what we need today is a house cleaning from the pit all the way to the janitor and they starting over again and get some genuine faith into the people. That's what we need today in W of Bethlehem. What we need today is an opening of the word that lives not dead world but a living word that he's the same yesterday, today and forever. That's what we need today in W of Bethlehem. He says what we need today is a fresh pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon the hearts of the people. That's what we need today. In the token, he says, \"What we need today is a refreshing of baptism of the Holy Ghost spirit back in the church. Not a celebration, but the falling up of the baptism of the Holy Ghost.\" He says the world is falling apart. What we need today is not educational systems. It's not it's not it's not lectures. What we need today is the gospel handled by the power of God to vindicate the word of this hour. Amen. We need the Holy Ghost to vindicate the word for this hour. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe it? That's what we need today. That's what we need today. That's what we need today. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He says in the world is the world is again falling apart. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you what we need today is the word of God anointed for this age that will bring forth the power of the Holy Ghost again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need the power of the Holy Ghost again. [Applause] What we need today is a good old-fashioned backwood sky blue sunkilling religion and the baptism of the Holy Ghost back into the church again. A cleaning out, a gun barrel straight, a sky blue religion. We need a cleaning out and a starting all over again. That's the truth. [Applause] What we need today is a God send back to a born again experience of the Bible. What we need today is a message anointed with a messiahship of Christ. What we need today is a real man of God. What we need today is a real man of God who stands on the word and tells the truth about him. That's what we need today. We don't need a back to front caller man, but we need a man of God for today. For today. We need a man of God for today. Brothers, we need a man of God for today. [Applause] Have you found a man of God for today? People, have you found a man of God for today? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's what I say today. What we need today is men with experience. We need men with experience. We don't need man that has just come now lately and think they have something. But we need a man that's got experience that knows the tricks of the enemy. A man that knows God. A man that walks with God. A man that's filled with God. A man that's anointed of God. That's what we need today. He that's what we need today. Phil says that's what we need today. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's what I see. What we need today is man with experience &gt;&gt; that knows what God means &gt;&gt; and takes God's experience by God's Bible and preaches God's word has God's signs and God's foundation. That's what we need today. That's what you need today. What we need today is men and women who will take God by his word and be persistent with it. You don't give up, but you persistent. Amen.

We have the power of God in our roots.

Imagine you're so full of the Holy Ghost. There's no devil that can come near you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. The devil says God is not much. He says, \"Satan, this year you're talking into now, he's got the Holy Ghost in it. &gt;&gt; I can't hear you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I feel sorry.

[Applause] &gt;&gt; The anointing will raise a standard against him. Amen. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] In closing, &gt;&gt; God told Samuel, \"Take the lamb's home. Put it on your side. &gt;&gt; I got a job for you. &gt;&gt; Take the oil and put it on your side. I got somebody that you got to anoint.

Have you got a David? Have you a shepherd? Have you got a man of God here? The oil wasn't meant for the Brandon. The oil you come to South Africa with a container and you find a boy and pour it on him.

It's upon a man anointed. Anointed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; and the anointing came mightily upon him. that he told &gt;&gt; the Bible says immediately the spirit came mightily upon the land &gt;&gt; that this little boy &gt;&gt; when the bear camel &gt;&gt; when the moody came &gt;&gt; he says I took out my slingshot &gt;&gt; because this little boy says I fear no evil because the anointing of the prophet is upon me. He slew the bear. &gt;&gt; He slew the lion. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And this morning, Hebron, I don't care what sickness or what trouble you in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That boy is here &gt;&gt; and he can kill Goliath for you this morning.

Hello. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my Thank you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Thank you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, &gt;&gt; Mama Bonnie. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Nice to meet you. Yes. [Applause] [Music] I thought um two weeks ago we will I wanted to come to Moapani and then we had a funeral and every time I want to come something falls &gt;&gt; and um I waited [Music] And um that the other day I told Jonathan and Jude &gt;&gt; this one day you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] are. So, we made it. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; And um &gt;&gt; I think we've been blessed already. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you getting a triple blessing? [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Pray that God bless you father. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; As I said with the last combine now &gt;&gt; Jacob [Music] wasn't so much worried about the birthight. &gt;&gt; He was worried about the blessing of the birthight. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The trouble, the trouble came in with a blessing &gt;&gt; and not with a birthight. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; And then when he had the blessing, &gt;&gt; he wasn't satisfied. And he bumped into the angel &gt;&gt; and he told the angel, \"You better bless me again.\" &gt;&gt; And the angel blessed him again. &gt;&gt; He blessed him so much &gt;&gt; that he changed his name to Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then God says, \"No, because you blessed twice. I'll call your homeland Israel &gt;&gt; because it's a double blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; We thank God for the blessing &gt;&gt; on the birthright. Everybody's got a birthight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Talk about the Holy Ghost wherever you go. But that's just a birthright. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we're looking for the blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That don't cease. &gt;&gt; It's there in every service. Is there we come together and uh it never ceases. &gt;&gt; So I greet you again. Nice to see the temple there. Amen. [Applause] I thought if I come over here, I want to preach on something and this is the thing I would like to preach on or maybe just try to speak on it. And um it's a thing that I feel we have to be careful, very careful. It's um maybe just a warning &gt;&gt; for everybody that's in here of tabernacle. And it's a thing that God don't pull back on. &gt;&gt; You can play around with anything else. [Music] But with this thing, you don't fool with it. And I would like to take scripture in Psalm 92 verse 10. If you have your Bibles with you, but my horn shall thou exalt my horn. Whatever little power I have, &gt;&gt; you will exalt it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Like the horn of a unicorn. I shall be anointed with fresh oil. &gt;&gt; I shall be anointed &gt;&gt; with fresh oil. &gt;&gt; And then we know Matthew 25:3 says the foolish virgins took no oil with them. Let us pray. Father, as I also have to be careful with oil, I pray that you'd undertake for us this morning. Bless your word, anointed. [Music] May it go from here to the uttermost parts of the earth as a warning. Lord, let us once again value our values and not let it slip. I ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. Amen. [Applause] If I if I should entitle this message, I'll entitle it the lost anointing. The lost anointing. Now, when you lose something, it means that you did have it before, &gt;&gt; but you lost it. Something happened that you don't have it anymore. And I do not think there is a church upon the face of the earth that can boast like we do &gt;&gt; of having the anointing. What was that? We are warned not to lose it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture says, \"Anoint me with fresh.\" It doesn't mean you weren't anointed. &gt;&gt; It means you were anointed. &gt;&gt; But something happened with your anointing. You lost it in some way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And because you lost it, you need a fresh &gt;&gt; anointing. If you lost 50 rand, it means you had a 50 rand &gt;&gt; but something happened &gt;&gt; that you lost it. If you had the oil and you lost it, it means that you were experienced of having the oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, amen. &gt;&gt; We need a fresh Bathe of oil &gt;&gt; for a fresh anointing. [Applause] This means the oil on the old anointing. That means the old oil either dried up or you lost it or some wise crack. maneuver you &gt;&gt; away from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now you don't have it &gt;&gt; what you had &gt;&gt; before. &gt;&gt; Like Esau, Esau had it. It was his. It belonged to him. and he didn't value it &gt;&gt; and he lost it. &gt;&gt; Samson &gt;&gt; was anointed of God, &gt;&gt; heavily anointed. There was nobody that was anointed like him. &gt;&gt; And yet he had it, but he lost it. Somebody stole it from him. &gt;&gt; A deceived church. [Music] &gt;&gt; Some intellect got the oil away from him. And he lost it. Eli the priest had the anointing was the high priest &gt;&gt; highly anointed from a prophet &gt;&gt; and yet he lost the oil and the Bible says it was kabot Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Means the glory of the Lord has departed from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Had it, owned it, but he didn't appreciate it. [Music] Week after week, month after month, Wednesday after Wednesday, convention after convention, Easter after Easter, we have the anointing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It was ours all the time. [Applause] But friends, have we still have it like we always had it? &gt;&gt; Is there still an excitement &gt;&gt; before you leave home and need to be in the church of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there still an excitement &gt;&gt; that hey, I want to serve God? Is there stood an excitement that hey I'm a son of God? Is there still a joy unspeakable that I'm a daughter of God? &gt;&gt; Or did we lose our anointing? &gt;&gt; Is it too hard for you to clap your hands? &gt;&gt; Did you lose your anointing? Is it too hard for you to say amen? &gt;&gt; Did you lose your anointing? &gt;&gt; Is it too hard for you to put on some dancing shoes? &gt;&gt; Or did you lose your anointing? &gt;&gt; This is the hour of a lost anointing. [Music] [Applause] Samson lost his anointing. The foolish virgin lost the oil. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says she went to look all over to get the oil, &gt;&gt; but she couldn't find it. &gt;&gt; She lost it. &gt;&gt; Bonnie. Don't let us lose &gt;&gt; the anointing. &gt;&gt; Don't let us lose the oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every service, every prayer meeting, every prayer that you put up, every callers that you say, every hand clap that you clap your hands with, say, \"Give me oil in my land. Give me burning. Give me burning to The lost anointing. You hear it from church to church. You hear we have no anointing. The church is dry. There's nothing in the church. The young people, the young girls, the young boys says it's monotonous &gt;&gt; to go to church. &gt;&gt; You know what? &gt;&gt; You lost your anointing. &gt;&gt; Church of today, you lost your oil. an elaborate &gt;&gt; while I'm here. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be one drop of oil &gt;&gt; that's going to be spilled [Music] [Applause] all. [Applause] Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; It means that you once had it &gt;&gt; but you lost it. &gt;&gt; Some slick preacher, &gt;&gt; intellectual preacher, &gt;&gt; eloquent speaker &gt;&gt; talked you out of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now you sit in a church &gt;&gt; where God left long ago. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You had it before. Hebrews 6:4. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible says they tasted of the heavenly gift. &gt;&gt; If ever there was a church that tasted of this heavenly gift is us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Very tasty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of the heavenly gift. &gt;&gt; Didn't it taste good? &gt;&gt; It tastes so good. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That we don't want to stay out of church. &gt;&gt; It tasted so good that we dragged our Torah to the church. It tasted so good that we made our husbands and wives follow us to the church. &gt;&gt; It tasted so good that our neighbors is in the church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is it fullfasting good? [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and were partakers of what? &gt;&gt; Of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I don't hear you. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Partakers of what? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You were a partaker. [Music] You are not a &gt;&gt; spectator. &gt;&gt; You are conceded. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You clapped your hands. You spoke in tongues. your love of life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We are the partaker. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now, for that person that's a partaker of the Holy Ghost, for him to fall away, &gt;&gt; for him to lose it, it's nearly impossible to be. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why? because it's a lost anointing. &gt;&gt; You lost your anointing. &gt;&gt; Let us not lose &gt;&gt; our anointing. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Look where he is. When Esau When Esau lost his anointing, look where he landed up. The word of God says he went to go look for it. &gt;&gt; He went to go and search to get it. &gt;&gt; He went from place to place to try and get repentance, but the Bible says he didn't find it. &gt;&gt; He lost it. He lost it forever. &gt;&gt; He could never get it again. [Music] &gt;&gt; It was gone. &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin when she lost it, when there was nothing oil left nowhere, Brother Bram says she went to go look for it. And uh the wise version told uh the the foolish version, you going to buy &gt;&gt; and they tell you must love. Where was the love then? &gt;&gt; There's no time for love. &gt;&gt; There's no time for love. &gt;&gt; It's time for oil. [Applause] And the Bible says And the Bible says that the foolish virgin went to go look for oil and brother Bruno says they didn't find it &gt;&gt; gone. &gt;&gt; Look what happened to them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, \"Open the door.\" &gt;&gt; And the voice says, \"I know you not. I don't know you, &gt;&gt; you know, just just because of oil, &gt;&gt; but Lord, I got the lamp. I got the word of God. I've got I've got the mechanics, Lord. I've got it here. He says, I know you're not. &gt;&gt; Mechanics is only the word of the spirit. &gt;&gt; It's not the spirit. The spirit brings the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the lamp is no good. &gt;&gt; We rode to church this morning. &gt;&gt; And how many people has gone to church and they got big Bibles &gt;&gt; in their hands and going to church? And I said, \"My God, look at that. That's only lamp. &gt;&gt; But where's the oil?\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's only the worm. Where's the oil? &gt;&gt; Many a many end time believer has gone to church this morning with a spoken word in his hand and the Bible in the other hand. Amen. And they go to the church and there's no oil. &gt;&gt; Then what good is the spoken word? &gt;&gt; What good is the Bible? If there's no oil to make it alive, [Applause] &gt;&gt; look where Samson landed up. &gt;&gt; He says, \"Let me die now. I got no anointing.\" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look at Eli the high priest landed up. He broke his neck and Kabot came over. Friend, as you sit in this church and you search yourself with oil and there's any wicked way in you, &gt;&gt; why don't you get rid of it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any wicked way. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Look on Zedekiah and Micaiah. Zedekiah said, \"Micaiah, where did the spirit of God go when he left me?\" &gt;&gt; That means once he had the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now he don't have it. &gt;&gt; Lost anointing &gt;&gt; to somebody now. Who's up? [Applause] &gt;&gt; It shows you that you got to keep on filling up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. shows you you can't take a chance to stay out of church, &gt;&gt; brothers. You might lose a cup of oil. &gt;&gt; It shows you that when it is here, &gt;&gt; you grab it with two hands. &gt;&gt; You valued your family. [Applause] Oh my God. So Jude quoted one little Bethlehem. What do we need today? A fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost. Fresh oil. Fresh baptism. &gt;&gt; We need a fresh baptism. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're going to act like mad people. [Applause] That's [Applause] &gt;&gt; what a fresh anointing will do. &gt;&gt; Samson. Oh, Samson. &gt;&gt; Heavy anointed of God. &gt;&gt; Heavy anointed &gt;&gt; of God. [Music] killed a thousand men, stroking them with a jaw born of an ass. &gt;&gt; Samson, could tear the mouth of a lion like you put a hot knife through butter. &gt;&gt; Samson. &gt;&gt; Samson. He could coin a riddle. from his own testimony &gt;&gt; that nobody could answer. &gt;&gt; Samson, &gt;&gt; oh Samson, &gt;&gt; he could pay his debts to 30 Philistines just like that &gt;&gt; because he promised them if he knows they're little, he'll pay them 30 pieces of &gt;&gt; garments. And he paid them Oh, Samson. &gt;&gt; Samson. He could take 300 foxes. One man catches 300 foxes. So anointed is a man and tie their their tails together &gt;&gt; and send them into the fields of the Philistines &gt;&gt; with a burning torch on it. Mhm. &gt;&gt; One man could do that. &gt;&gt; How many foxes is in the pulpit today that tell tales, Amen, to the congregation until they lose their anointing. Until they found out that the oil is gone, they tell tales. Amen. [Applause] And it's strange. He catches foxes. And when somebody say you're a fox, that means you're a scall. &gt;&gt; And Jesus says, \"Could tell Herod that fox. [Music] &gt;&gt; We got too many foxes that lost their anointing &gt;&gt; in the pulpits today. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's no oil coming from the head &gt;&gt; from the pastor &gt;&gt; down into the skirts of the congregation. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because it's the lost &gt;&gt; anointing. My &gt;&gt; Samson could do all those things. &gt;&gt; When the anointing was fresh on him, &gt;&gt; Samson could do all those things. When he felt the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit was upon him, &gt;&gt; a thousand men meant nothing to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of the anointing. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the anointing breaks the yoke. [Applause] Samson, &gt;&gt; when you walk down the street, &gt;&gt; the people will notch one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There goes Samson. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mighty one. &gt;&gt; He could even walk down the very streets of Kaza. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a guazians will say, \"Leave that man alone.\" &gt;&gt; Because if he's anointed, &gt;&gt; he can kill thousands just like that. &gt;&gt; That's when the anointing is fresh. [Applause] Samson was untouchable &gt;&gt; when the anointing is on him. &gt;&gt; They have to they have to stand back &gt;&gt; when the anointing is on him. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you &gt;&gt; that hell knows &gt;&gt; when the anointing is on you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That not one demon &gt;&gt; could come and take a chance &gt;&gt; because the yoke gets broken by the anointed. [Applause] And that's when the oil was still fresh on Samson. &gt;&gt; But when he gave away the secret and the secret was they brought in some dead worship. Brother Brandham says &gt;&gt; that was a secret. &gt;&gt; Did you give away your secret? by formal &gt;&gt; dead worship. Sure. &gt;&gt; And the minute he gave away the secret, the minute he gave away the thing that's supposed to keep the anointing, the minute he gave away his wedding garment, &gt;&gt; the anointing left. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The oil left. Then he had a lost anointing. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you know the pity and worst part of it all, the Bible says he knew it not &gt;&gt; that the anointing left. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They say the Bible says when that anointing left him, you know what Samson cried out? You know what he cried out? He said, \"I'll go out like you like all the other times. I'll go out &gt;&gt; and I'll avenge myself like I avenge myself when I killed a thousand of them. &gt;&gt; I'll go out myself.\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'll do it again. And the Bible says you would not that he had a lost anointing. &gt;&gt; Samson was relying on the God of yesterday. &gt;&gt; Right there now. The now God wasn't vain. They give God glory for what he has done yesterday when he killed a thousand men. &gt;&gt; And they give God glory for what he's going to do. But Samson, where's the now God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Samson replied &gt;&gt; on a God of history. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it didn't help him a bit &gt;&gt; to rely on a God of history. &gt;&gt; It won't help you a bit &gt;&gt; for realizing last week you had an anointing on you. W. &gt;&gt; How does it look now? [Applause] &gt;&gt; They said in the message circles we'll have a restoration of your glory. God. &gt;&gt; In other words, we'll go out again one more time and we'll show the world that that anointing is still with us. Amen. The people will dance. Amen. The pastor's wives will fall in the spirit. Amen. We'll show them again once more time that there'll be tongues. Uh we'll show them once more again that the will walk. We show them once again that angels will walk in the pillows and baptize the people with the Holy Spirit. We'll show them once again. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] And when they went out to show us once again, &gt;&gt; there was nothing. &gt;&gt; What was it? &gt;&gt; A lost anointing. &gt;&gt; A lost anointing. [Applause] [Music] Don't let us lose &gt;&gt; what we had. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Young man, don't lose &gt;&gt; that which you have. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Young golf, young sister, don't lose &gt;&gt; what you have. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They came to the end of 20 years and then only found out it's gone. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now they wake up. &gt;&gt; We'll go and get it again. &gt;&gt; It's just like Katie's beneer. When they got to Katie's beneer and they rejected it, they lost it. They gave it up. Amen. And the spies actually brainwashed them. They were better preachers than Joshua and Caleb. They preached the people under the table. They couldn't listen, amen, to God's voice in Joshua and Caleb. Because when a man of God speaks, that's the voice of God to them. [Applause] They couldn't even pick up &gt;&gt; who's got the voice of God. So the anointing left them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they said, \"Man, Moses, we realize now we made a mistake. We realize now that there's something short here in the church. We realize we've got the Ten Commandments without the palire.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll go back and we're going to take the land again. And Moses says, \"Don't go.\" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just God said we must go. He said no God is not with you. &gt;&gt; He rejected it. &gt;&gt; You lost the anointing. &gt;&gt; Don't go. &gt;&gt; And they went back and they died like flies under the spray of doom. [Music] &gt;&gt; One thing God hates when you reject the land and try to go get it back again. They hate you. &gt;&gt; It kills all of them. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Because it's the lost anointing. [Music] &gt;&gt; There's nothing as sad as to see when a man lost his anointing. It was so sad to see the de J lost his anointing and he gave it over to his daughter. And how can a woman carry the anointing when God says she's not supposed to be in the boost [Music] anointing? Then you find out after 20 years, my brother, after 20 years, they only found out that the glory of God has gone. &gt;&gt; It'sot. &gt;&gt; Can you go on all the time and not pick up that the Holy Ghost is gone? &gt;&gt; Yes. When the ark left &gt;&gt; Israel and it roamed around in the Philistines land and miracles happened in the Philistines land where gods fell to their faces in front of the ark. Israel still went on as if they've got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what's happening. And it's not going to happen here. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen here. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Father, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That the deal gloria was gone. Though they come after they preached and they preached and they preach and they come to the end of the sermonate and they see there is no &gt;&gt; glory and they try to sing songs to bring the glory and the glory still don't come they only become Pentecostals &gt;&gt; when the glory is gone That's when they sang. &gt;&gt; I didn't know &gt;&gt; though when they come to the end of the sermonet and they try to pump and pump and pump and pump. And when they finish pumped, there's no water flowing. &gt;&gt; It's dead. &gt;&gt; The glory of God has departed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When they come to the end of that preaching and they beg the people, why don't you? Amen. Why didn't you say hallelujah? Clap your hands. Then the people clap their hands for 2 minutes and it's gone. There is no anointing. There's a noise with no anointing. &gt;&gt; There's a noise [Applause] with no spirit. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the lost &gt;&gt; anointing. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; The glory of God. &gt;&gt; You look at guys like Masam. They left here. Come visit their church. Come. They don't see if the glory of God did leave them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And listen, they know it &gt;&gt; because they already tasted it. &gt;&gt; They come from the place where they taste it. [Applause] Samson said, \"I'll go out like other times.\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it's like brother Benham says, as I said, he relied on a God of history. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yesterday, God. has done it. &gt;&gt; Killed a thousand men &gt;&gt; yesterday. He could tie 300 foxes tails together. Yesterday he could kill so many people that you can't count them yesterday. But Samson, can you kill a thousand today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Samson, &gt;&gt; that god of yesterday that killed a thousand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can it kill it today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Or is it the lost anointing &gt;&gt; of a bunny &gt;&gt; or the second story? &gt;&gt; Don't let anybody rob it from you. Don't let anybody rob this feeling. Get some pani from you. [Music] [Applause] And when Samson lost &gt;&gt; the anointing, &gt;&gt; watch it. When Samson lost the anointing, the first thing he heard, Samson, the Philistines are upon you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The minute you lose the anointing, &gt;&gt; the Philistines are upon you. &gt;&gt; Is the song on you? &gt;&gt; Have you trusted the song GMA more than Jesus? [Music] &gt;&gt; So can't do nothing. He uses everything God does. &gt;&gt; He tells you to take the boat. Who made the boat? &gt;&gt; He tells you, \"Stand there. Let me throw the bones.\" Who made the bones? [Applause] &gt;&gt; He told you to drink this mine. Who made the m [Music] Now I serve the god of the mut. What does God make? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; You know why you go to a sangoma? It's because you've got a lost anointing. &gt;&gt; You need a fresh anointing. Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and &gt;&gt; oh my &gt;&gt; the first thing you &gt;&gt; Samson Samson Oh, Samson. Samson. The Philistines had upon you. &gt;&gt; How did they get in? How did the Somas get in here? &gt;&gt; I tell you, you trust the Soma more than would you trust God. Why don't you strive to trust God the way you trusted the lying &gt;&gt; dirty Soma? And maybe God can do something for us. &gt;&gt; Bring back those happy days with a fresh anointing. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The pathetic part of it all, Joel. The pathetic part of it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The worst part of it all. Who's cleaned that the Philistines have upon you? Who's cleaned that? &gt;&gt; His own church. Jezebel. Jezebel told the pastor, &gt;&gt; \"The Philistines are upon you. &gt;&gt; The congregation is now telling the pastors, &gt;&gt; you got no anointing. &gt;&gt; Their own congregation, &gt;&gt; their own churches &gt;&gt; say there is no anointing in this church.\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Since a young man I was worried I've read years ago when deceived church brother Brandham that's the the problem when you push and play you get all the things amen from the tape and on the tape brother Brandham cries out in deceive church he says banam tabernacle the Philistines are upon And I tried to find out the place where he retrieved that. He never fixed it up. &gt;&gt; And I wonder if it is still like that. &gt;&gt; I just wonder [Music] what &gt;&gt; as long &gt;&gt; as this man is here. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Applause] I really don't care about your tradition. &gt;&gt; I don't care about the salute tradition. I don't care about the su tradition. I don't care about a perry tradition. I only have one tradition and that is thus saith the Lord. [Applause] Can you wave your Bibles to the Solomas? [Applause] Can you wave your Bible to the Somas? This is our tradition. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I was laughing from Bkari. She's a dun &gt;&gt; and a tun died and uh &gt;&gt; her elders came to her and the elders says mkari rearing your two and tomorrow today you have to come with us down to the graveyard. She says for what? He says no you got to get into the grave. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And um she says, \"And when I don't do it,\" she said is,\" they said, \"Then you're going to die very, very soon. Maybe in a year's time.\" She said, \"Well, I'm not going.\" And she didn't go. I asked her the other day, but I was 4 years now. The other day, I says, \"Um, how long was your she said, Four years?\" I said, \"Now, what are you doing here? A bunch of liars. [Music] [Applause] There's a sister in Joelberg. There's a sister in Joelberg. She's in the church now. But before she was in the church, she she liked to go to Soma. Every little penny she has, she runs to the Soma. And she asked the sun about the job. So the sun said, \"No, amen. Just kill a goat.\" A goat belongs to God, but he makes it as if it's his. And you take the skin and you tie it around your home. &gt;&gt; Now the minute you put this, it's like handcuffs. You're cuffed with this one, &gt;&gt; but you tie it up skin. Yes. &gt;&gt; And after she did that, she told me the says, \"You'll never lose your job now.\" &gt;&gt; I says, \"Oh, yeah. Did he say that?\" Yeah. She says, \"So I'm secure. I'm losing my job forever.\" I came back 2 weeks after that. She's not there. I got a hold of her. I said, \"Sister, I don't see you there at a job anymore.\" \"No, I got fired.\" I said no. I lied. &gt;&gt; How can we listen to him? &gt;&gt; That's a lost anointing. &gt;&gt; And Samson, &gt;&gt; you can't even fool the young people anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; On the internet. &gt;&gt; And then I ask another brother. He says, \"No, you must pay laba, man. You must pay laba.\" I said, \"Oh, yeah.\" I said, \"Oh, no. You must pay, you know.\" So, you want the papi? Well, fine. You must pay. I said, \"But dad, uh, have you finished your laba?\" He said, \"No, I still owe after 30 years.\" &gt;&gt; What nonsense is that? You stole all Labola, but you want the guy to pay Labala. &gt;&gt; It's a bunch of nonsense. We only have one tradition. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, and Samson &gt;&gt; lost the anointing. Hallelujah. when his hair grew back again for a fresh anointing in Judges 16:30, the Bible says, \"So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life. When the fresh anointing comes, &gt;&gt; then you kill more Philistines in your life. [Applause] Oh my. When the locks close again, &gt;&gt; when the seven thunder locks close again, then you only have one cry. You only have one prayer. &gt;&gt; Lord, let me die with my enemy. that fresh anointing comes, you're going to say, \"Lord, is there any wicked way in me? Let me die. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, then you die. When the new revival comes and the fires are burning, then you die to false teachings. &gt;&gt; You die and you claim &gt;&gt; because all the Philistines are dead in your life. &gt;&gt; Don't you feel like that? Amen. &gt;&gt; A fresh alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let it get away with &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here's another thing that goes with the foolish virgins &gt;&gt; that lost their anointing. Can I preach on [Applause] &gt;&gt; Judges 16:E 19 &gt;&gt; and this sounds like Matthew 25. It says, \"And she, the church, Jezebel, made him, Samson, sleep upon her knees.\" &gt;&gt; He fell asleep. &gt;&gt; On the knees of a deceived church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] And the foolish virgins &gt;&gt; fell asleep until Revelations 10 was made clear. [Music] &gt;&gt; And it woke up the church once again &gt;&gt; because he says the seven thunders wakes up the bride. Revelations 10 wakes up the bride. &gt;&gt; We were sleeping &gt;&gt; in the lamp &gt;&gt; of Jezebel churches. &gt;&gt; Pastors. Hallelujah. Sleep until she forgot to get full of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Sleep until the enticing knees of the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May the loser locks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sleep church till the power of your Nazarite vow gets exploited by Jezebel. &gt;&gt; Sweep until the Philistines creeps up suddenly and they don't know how the Somas came in. &gt;&gt; Amen. My my my &gt;&gt; run. &gt;&gt; Sleep until they bind you. Bind you with goat skins. Bind you &gt;&gt; hand and foot &gt;&gt; down at the ankles and here with goat skins. [Music] sleep until you grind in the prisons of false doctrine. [Music] Sleep until the soul must eat your last &gt;&gt; s. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sleep on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sleep until the tribulation get a hold of you. Yes, Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Sleep until you don't even hear the words of Matthew 25. Enter in &gt;&gt; sleep on now soal bride in a message. [Applause] sleep until you grind &gt;&gt; in the prison house and around and around and around and around and around false doctrine. He'll go the baptism of the Holy Ghost with no emotions. Around and around and around you go. The seven thunders is the seven virtues. False doctrine. And you're grinding trying to make it love. &gt;&gt; And you're going around and around and around and you go around. You visit this church &gt;&gt; tomorrow. I hear you visit that church &gt;&gt; around and around and around you go. Tomorrow I hear you preach in Tucson. &gt;&gt; The next day I hear you preach &gt;&gt; on the robo park. &gt;&gt; Around and around and around you go climbing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To try and make your doctor love &gt;&gt; around and around and around you go. &gt;&gt; And you know when a person go around and around, he don't go forward. He comes out to the same place. [Applause] Then you hear he's here. Then you hear he's there. Then you hear he believes this. Then you hear he believes that. And around and around they come. &gt;&gt; Then you believe they inhale tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Then you hear no. They broke away. They were Raymond Thompson. Amen. Then you hear he broke away there. He went to to then you hear he left there. He's now with death. Then you hear he left there. He's sitting at home. And around and around and around he goes. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Young man, young girl, it doesn't help you to go around and around and try this and try that and see if drugs is good. See if kissing another boy is good. You're going around and around and around, but you're not moving forward. [Applause] And God got sick of it. &gt;&gt; And God got sick of it. &gt;&gt; God got sick of it &gt;&gt; of going around and around around this mountain &gt;&gt; because this is the mountain that brought the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God says enough. &gt;&gt; You're going around around around this mountain and the promised land is just a few days away where you can get the baptism of the Holy Ghost on &gt;&gt; the word &gt;&gt; the lost anointed. [Applause] [Music] For the latter killth and the spirit giveth a life. If the oil leaves, they bind you. &gt;&gt; Listen, the minute you lose the oil, you're going to be binded &gt;&gt; by something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Something is going to bind you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the devil make sure &gt;&gt; that he's got you now because you don't have no power &gt;&gt; to break the yoke. &gt;&gt; So it's easy to bind you. [Applause] If the oil fails, then you hear the cry, \"The Philistines are upon you.\" &gt;&gt; If the oiler leaves, they take out your eyes so that you don't see the revelation &gt;&gt; of the token. [Applause] If the boy leaves, then hell has a taste. &gt;&gt; When Simpson lost his eyes, they were busting. &gt;&gt; They were having a party. They were glad. They got God's champion. That's when the oil leaves. &gt;&gt; If the oil leaves, there's only one prayer left. &gt;&gt; One prayer now. Lord, let me die with my enemies. It's the only prayer. When the oil leaves &gt;&gt; closing, &gt;&gt; what we need &gt;&gt; is fresh oil &gt;&gt; and a fresh anointing. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm close. the lost anointing &gt;&gt; because because &gt;&gt; you struggle to worship &gt;&gt; you have to be begged to clap your hands. &gt;&gt; What you need is a fresh anointing. [Applause] You struggle with a sex spirit. &gt;&gt; A problem with a sex spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what you need is a fresh anointing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Please Lord, &gt;&gt; your eyes get can't get enough of pornography on your phone. &gt;&gt; You know what you need is a fresh anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord. &gt;&gt; You can't overcome the things of the world. You know why? Because you need &gt;&gt; a fresh anointing over &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You need a fresh anointing tabernacle around South Africa. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You can't help lying and cheating. &gt;&gt; You need a fresh anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You take the sun's advice &gt;&gt; and tie goat skins on your wrist &gt;&gt; and become a slave to them. &gt;&gt; It's time you know that the anointing on you is stronger than the anointing on that goal. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] You do what the sun says, &gt;&gt; but you don't do what God says. &gt;&gt; We believe so much in a song. Now, &gt;&gt; why don't you take that belief &gt;&gt; and put it on Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and see &gt;&gt; what the Lord can do. [Applause] You even drink &gt;&gt; the mutyle &gt;&gt; that you stole from God's roots and leaves to make the moody. &gt;&gt; You believe in the mi and the mi is not healing you, &gt;&gt; but this moody &gt;&gt; can heal you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] You spend your money on a soma &gt;&gt; and you can't even pay your debt. [Music] [Applause] You spend your money &gt;&gt; on clothes and eat out &gt;&gt; but can't help in the needy box. You need a fresh anointing [Applause] &gt;&gt; my sisters right around everything. Don't let your tongue be as long as your skirt. [Music] [Applause] I read some of the questions on the woman's day. &gt;&gt; Our churches, our homes is a war zone &gt;&gt; cuz these young brothers are so stingy. What do you do with your money? &gt;&gt; If you had to serve the devil, you would have to take out his tithes to buy cigarettes. &gt;&gt; You have to take out his tithes &gt;&gt; to buy some castle logo. &gt;&gt; You're going to take out his tides. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. to pay for DSTD. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're going to take out your tithes and give it to Ramaposa. &gt;&gt; He wants his tithes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when it comes to God, &gt;&gt; you don't give your tithes. &gt;&gt; Some give their tithes to some soccer team. Some give their tithes to some sport. &gt;&gt; But you don't. &gt;&gt; You need a fresh anointing. &gt;&gt; I wonder if the resistance will come. The money in the bank is your god. &gt;&gt; You don't want to spend anything. So stingy you become. &gt;&gt; You can't even buy your wife underneath clothing. &gt;&gt; So stingy you are. &gt;&gt; You can't even buy your wife some toiletry. &gt;&gt; You need a fresh anointing. [Applause] You sit in the church and you know there's an evil thing in your heart &gt;&gt; and yet you sin. &gt;&gt; You sit in dead churches that God left long ago but you still sit. It's the lost anointing. &gt;&gt; I know it's quiet here. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are you going around and around and around? If you put anything in front of God, whether it's your sport, whether it's your family, &gt;&gt; oh my, &gt;&gt; is that your God &gt;&gt; and not God? Yes, your God. Anything that you spend more time on, &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, &gt;&gt; behold your God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Will the musicians come? &gt;&gt; I'm here to ask you, &gt;&gt; wouldn't you like to welcome &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; a fresh anointing? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sprinkle of oil. Fresh oil &gt;&gt; from a fresh anointing. What? &gt;&gt; Are you going to go around and around and around &gt;&gt; like the Wesleyan church, like the Lutheran church? &gt;&gt; Since Luther died, they're still in the same place. &gt;&gt; They're going around and around, [Music] &gt;&gt; grinding &gt;&gt; in the doctrines of yesterday. &gt;&gt; But Elan is an extra vessel here. Lord [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; and I want to fool you &gt;&gt; with some fresh oil.

My brothers, if you feel &gt;&gt; that you didn't treat your wife right, &gt;&gt; why don't you come [Music] &gt;&gt; for a cup of fresh anointing? &gt;&gt; I assure you, &gt;&gt; your cup will run over. &gt;&gt; Yes, my Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes.

By that saying, we want to greet the Rosco family, our leadership. Amen. We can read Acts Acts 12:1. Amen. Acts 12. Amen. It says, \"Now about that time, Herod the king stretched forth his hand to vex certain of the church, and he killed James the brother of John with a sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also.\" Then were the days of the unleaven bread. And when he had appre apprehended him, he put him in prison and delivered him to four portions of shoulders to keep him, intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people, but therefore was kept in prison, but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. Like we are praying every Sunday. Amen. And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two shoulders bound with two chains. And the keepers before the door kept the prison. And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him. And the light shine in prison. And he smoked Peter on the one side and raised him up, saying, \"Arise up quickly.\" and the chains fell from his hand. And the angel said unto him, \"Guard thyself, and bind on thou's handles, and so he did.\" And he saith unto him, \"Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.\" And he went out and followed him. and worse note that it was true which was done by the angel. But though he saw a vision, when they were passed the first and the second w, they came unto a iron gate that leadth unto the city, which opened to them of of his own accord. And they went out and passed through the streets. And forth the angel departed from him. And when Peter was come to himself, he said, \"Now I know of situ that the Lord have sent his angel and have delivered me out of the land at the hand of Herod and from the expectation of the people of the Jews.\" Amen. And the question is, Amen. Hallelujah. Yesterday we were free. We were put free. But what did make us free? Who did made us free? Amen. As we read also Deanomium 15 that the apostle read yesterday. At the end of every seven years thou shall make a release. And this is the manner of the release. Every creditor that landed out unto his neighbor shall release it. He shall not exect it from his neighbor for of his or of his brother because it is called the Lord's released. Amen. And we are released this morning. We are free this morning. That's why we are here to tune in. Amen. But the question is, Amen. Who released us? Who made us free? Praise the Lord. Amen. And there's one thing that I knew. Amen. It was not a man that freed Peter. Praise the Lord. But something freed him. Amen. But it was the angel of the Lord that came upon Peter. Amen. And last night, praise the Lord. It was not a man that freed us, but it was the angel of the pulpit, amen, that freed the people, amen. And that's why we can say we are free this morning. It was not a man's doing. Amen. But it was the angel of the Lord. Amen. And what I liked about this angel, he didn't just free Peter, but he walked with Peter. Amen. Hallelujah. That angel walked with Peter through the wats. Amen. Hallelujah. And when they came at the iron gate, Amen. Hallelujah. The iron gate opened themsself. Amen. Hallelujah. This is the time. Amen. Hallelujah. To walk with the angel of the Lord. Amen. After the chains fell off. Amen. After you are freed. Amen. Hallelujah. That's not not good enough. Amen. Hallelujah. There's an angel that wants to walk with you. Amen. Hallelujah.

He walks with you through the critics. Amen. Hallelujah. He walks through you. Amen. Through the prison houses. Amen. Until you are free in the streets. Amen. Hallelujah. So it was not a man yesterday. But it was the angel of the Lord setting us free. Amen. Hallelujah. It was like a vision yesterday. We couldn't understand it. It was like a dream. Amen. We couldn't understand it. Amen. Hallelujah. But when we realize, Amen. We are free this morning. Unless we came together this morning to worship Jesus, King God. Amen. Oh, hallelujah. We are free this morning. I just want to read Acts 16. Amen. 25. Amen. And at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed. Amen. Whenever there is something to be set free, it's just a prayer that's going out. Amen. Hallelujah. And this morning, we going to pray. Amen. At midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and they sang the praises unto God in the prisons and heard them. Amen. And suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were open and everyone's band were loosened. Amen. Last night we started to sing. Amen. Last night we started to shout. Last night we started to praise Jesus King God. And it felt like a earthquake in here. Amen. Hallelujah.

Amen. We were set free last night. Amen. And I thank the Lord that I was here yesterday. Amen. Hallelujah. You cannot be set free if there is no angel of the Lord. There must be an angel. Amen. There must be an angel of the Lord on the earth. Amen. To set you free. Like Michael, Jesus, King God. When that angel come came on the earth and hang on Calvary, he set us free. You cannot be set free outside of the angel of the Lord. Whenever there's a exodus, there must be an angel, amen, to take the people out. Amen. Whenever there's exodus, Amen. When Moses came on the scene and he had his exodus to take the people out of Egypt. Amen. There was a angel in the land. had a burning bush experience. The angel was in the burning bush and the angel took the people out of Egypt. Amen. And when Moses couldn't go further, well, they exalted, Joshua took over. Amen. And there was the angel, the captain of the Lord's host. Whenever you are set free, there must be an angel. Amen. And we have our exodus. We are here. Amen. We're going to vacate the premises. We're going to go home. Amen. Hallelujah. We have our exodus and we're going home. Amen. So we must have angel of the Lord here. There must be angel and we are set free from sickness. We are set free. Amen. Hallelujah. Whatsoever sickness it is, we have been set free. We have been set free from problems. We have been set free from prison houses.

We thank the Lord. We going right in the supernatural because we have been set free when Jesus was on the earth. Amen. And they talk about the taxes. Amen. Hallelujah. Jesus said, \"Go down to the river and catch a fish.\" Amen. And took out the money. Amen. I can't wait for that day. Then the word of the Lord will be back in the in the mouth of the people. Amen. Where we will have thus sayeth the Lord. We don't care if you have a drop or no drop. We don't care if you have money or no money, but we will have something in our mouths. Amen. Hallelujah.

[Music] When Daniel saw a vision of that, he said, \"Though that they do wicked shall do wickedly in the last days, but they that know that God shall do exploits in the last days.\" Speaking of this time know what exploits is. Exploits of faith will perform signs and wonders, but the wicked will continue to do wicked. said they'll run to and through and knowledge shall increase but said close up the book. Oh Daniel, thou shalt sleep in thy lot but thou shalt stand in the last days. And they that be wise shall then turn many to Christ. They shall shine. Amen. As the stars in heaven forever and ever. Praise the Lord. That is what we shall do. Amen. We will be have great exploits. Amen. Because we will have the word of the Lord in our mouth. Amen.

That birth right is what I'm going to have to get a hold of. Amen. That is what we need is the birthight. Amen. Because we're going to do exploits. Amen. That day on Calvary. Now notice greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer. Cast out devils by prayer but to impart the eternal life to the believers. The Holy Ghost was coming and given unto the hand of the church to impact impart life. That's what Calvary meant. He took, he stooped, regarded men and women and lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Spirit to be obedient believers. Men who were once unbelievers be made believers and impart spiritual eternal life. Amen. Hallelujah. So the Holy Ghost is not just here. Amen. I will heal our bodies. Amen. Hallelujah. But the angel of the pulpit. Amen. Hallelujah. He freed us. Amen. Hallelujah. And he impart eternal life. Amen. Hallelujah. It's not amen our bodies that is healed tonight.

And God expressed in Jesus Christ who was both father and son, holy ghost, the fullness of the godhead bodily. Now to the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in the church. The preeeminence all that was he poured into Christ and all that was all in Christ was he poured into the church. The believer not a denomination. We'll get that in a few minutes. Everything that was in God, he poured into Christ. But everything was that was in Christ, he poured into me. And that's why we'll do exploits. And this morning, don't think about the possible. When you play, think about what's impossible. Think about the signs and the oneness. As we go [Music] over, as we hold our hands together, pray Jesus King God.

We are also making ourself ready for good big things Lord for the prophet says Lord that once again Lord the world will hear directly from God. Amen. The bride has made us ready. God's apostle has preached something in us. God's apostle has put something in us. What did he put in us? The greater works. The greater works is not just to heal the sick but is to give eternal life, Father. And everyone that walked to that door received eternal life, heavenly father. And nothing can take that eternal life. Nothing can take that eternal life away from us. The Holy Ghost, what was the Holy Ghost sent for? The Holy Ghost was sent for to furtherance the work of God. And surely the work of God was furtherance. Hallelujah. And that Holy Ghost gave us eternal life. Uh hallelujah. And once again the bride of God, the church of God, the true believer will have the word of almighty God in his mouth. And Lord we can wait heavenly father to say let there be heavenly father when we can't receive nothing from the world. When the world won't give us anything, we will have something in us. Amen. Hallelujah. The prophet said, \"Amen.\" Hallelujah. Wait till that day. Amen. When that little dog is pushed in a corner, when that dog is pushed in a corner, hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And that dog don't know which way to go. Then you will see the power that is in that dog. Amen. And one day, the pride will be pushed in the corner. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And when we are pushed in that corner, when we have a little squeeze, Amen. Hallelujah. That power will come out of us. Amen. Hallelujah. That Holy Ghost power that is in us that we think that isn't there, but is somewhere there. Amen. Hallelujah. There was nothing around God. There was nothing around him. He was there in his loneliness, in the darkness. Amen. Hallelujah. But there was something in him. There was a vessel of the Lord in him. And he said, \"Let there be light.\" Amen. And one day when we don't know which way to go, when it's all dark around that mama, when there is no food in that cupboards, when there is no money on the table, when that mama is in the corner, that mama will only add one thing and is thus sayeth the Lord. Let there be. Amen. Hallelujah. We can wait, Lord. We know it's here, Lord. Hallelujah. Pastor Jonathan said, \"Hallelujah. Pench yourself and see if you're not changing.\" Hallelujah. We are busy changing. Hallelujah. Nature can feel the change. The heavens can feel the change. So the church of Almighty God can feel the change. Amen. Hallelujah. Then we will do great exploits of faith. Uh we will do signs and wonders. We will speak limps into existence. The blind will see again. The couple will walk again. Death will be raised. And is already happened in El Tabernacle that the blinded eyes has opened. The bride will have great exploits of faith. Hallelujah. We're not scared this morning. As the apostle says, God had to take us the long way so we won't turn back. Hallelujah. Jupiteration. We don't turn back to Egypt. But you took us the long way. And yet, Lord, in the long way, we found something. We found the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We found the captain of the Lord's host. We found the angel of the Lord. And the angel of the Lord took us through Jordan. The angel of the Lord took us through the Red Sea. The angel took us through the Philistine and the Sedestine and all the enemies. He took us through. Amen. Hallelujah. When there was no water, he gave us water. Hallelujah. Oh, we thank you this morning. When when Samson fought the Philistines and after he fought, he was tired. He said, \"Lord, are you going to let me die here?\" Amen. And there the water came out of the ground. That is where we are. We are in a time of the supernatural because no church can move outside of the supernatural. We will have thus sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah. In a time where nothing, God don't care if it's the ground, whatsoever it is, the waters shall come out. And this morning, I am here. I am here. this morning not to do the impossible not to ask the impossible. What my five senses can do. No sir, we come from God. Hallelujah. We come from the impossible. Lord, I'm here to ask the impossible from you, Lord. We are Lord is the believer that will do exploits of faith. Amen. And what is a believer? A believer is when there is nothing. He believes there is something. And I don't care how far deep your children is in the world. I don't care how many people don't believe they can't come out of the prison house. A believer will say, \"One day is one day, amen, me and my house will serve the Lord.\" A believer don't believe today and the next day he don't believe anymore. But the true believer is like Joshua that says, \"Me and my house will serve the Lord.\" Joshua said, \"I don't care how many giants is in the land. I don't care how big the walls are. I don't care, but I know my redeemer loveth. I know the walls must come down.\" Joshua asked for the impossible, and the impossible is here. We come out of the impossible. We're not asking, Lord, today for something that the five senses can get, but we ask something today. Hallelujah. that the six sense can get. We ask something today. We want to step into faith. Amen. And virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and godly kindness and charity. The baptism of the Holy Ghost and want to go into impossible. What we think our hands can reach. There is another hand that can reach it is the hand of almighty God. Amen. We don't care the iron pass. We don't care the shackles on our feet. Uh we don't care this morning. We don't care this morning. The angel of the Lord is in our months. The angel of the Lord is in the camp. The angel of the Lord is with us. The angel of the Lord is with this people. The angel of the Lord is here. The angel of the Lord is here. The angel of the Lord is here. The angel of the Lord is hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why don't you open your mouth speaking? You have so much faith. You can speak your own world into existence. so much of the Holy Ghost and you got one love on it. When nobody can find you, when no problem can find you. Why don't you tell that mountain to move? Why don't you tell that river to open and walk my brother and walk my sister and walk my brother? This is the time to deliver. Whenever the angel of the Lord is there, the people are delivered. The people are set free. The people are set free. We are set free out tabernacle. We have been released. We have been released. We have been released. We have been released. We are set free. Our souls are free. Our children are free. The ministries are free. Everything is free. Hallelujah. Nothing can bound you.

Lord you said you will never leave us. You will never forsake us. You will never leave us, Lord. You'll never forsake us. This is the time for the angel to be seen. For 400 years, there was no angel. 400 years they were nothing. But when the exodus start, he has stepped the angel forth. And Lord is our exodus. We're going to leave this place, Lord of Texas. We got to leave this world Lord. And when we leave this world, there must be angel leading us. There must be an angel. [Music] This church is not a church for the possible.

As we are about to enter into our prayer session, can we just go into the word like to turn to Matthew chapter 21:3 and he said unto them, it is written, my house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves. The house of the Lord is called the house of prayer. And we have someone who has taught us how to pray. So without any further ado, we're going to thank him. We're going to worship him. We're going to praise him. We're going to thank him for the day that he has made. We're going to thank him for our families. We're going to thank him for our jobs or opportunities for making a living. We're going to thank him for this church. We're going to thank him for the leadership.

All the hope of glory is dwelling within our hearts. Oh father my God.

The brightest of them, oh my God. Uh there is darkness all over the earth. Oh father. There is darkness in the churches. Oh Lord. Uh the white horse rider is galloping. Oh father. Oh Lord God, my God. But here, oh father, is the church. Here is the ministry where they hearkened unto the voice of the hour when it said, \"Hurt not the oil and the wine.\" Uh father, we did not hurt the oil and the wine. Uh in fact, we are the church, oh Lord, uh that has taken the lamp with an extra vessel of oil. Oh God, uh we are the church that took the lamp with the extra vessel. Oh father, we are wise. Oh father, though, oh lord, the other churches, oh father, may see us as foolish people, oh God, uh oh lord, but though, oh father, I may be a fool in their eyes, uh I am wise in Christ, uh because I have found a placeh and I have found the man where the spirit of truth dwells. Uh what manner of man is this uh in whom the spirit of the Lord dwells? Lord my God, my God, you have made a way for my brother, you have made a way for my sister to come into the house of prayer, to come into the house of worship, to come into the house of praise. Oh father, we can't help but worship. Oh Lord, we can't help but praise you. Jehovah, we can't help but shout. Jehovah Rosco, we can't help it, oh God. Just as Moses couldn't help but name a certain place after you. Uh just as Jacob couldn't help but name a certain place after you. Uh just oh Lord like Abraham. Oh father couldn't help but say Jehovah Gyra. We say Jehovah Rosco because we have seen the man. We have handled him. Oh Lord. Oh God. We are wrestling with the angel. Oh father. My God. until the break of day. Uh keep me burning. Oh father give me oil in my lamp. Give me oil in my lamp. Keep me burning till the break of day. That light oh father is the very life of God. And in order for that life, oh father, to shine in my lamp. I need oil, oh God. And I found a place, oh Lord, where the oil is dripping. And it's coming from the head downh. And it's coming from the head down. Oh Lord my God. Uh after this after the Holy Ghost is come we will receive power. And we have gotten power. Oh God power in prayer. Power in speech in power in living a holy life. My God. Uh where would we be uh without this ministry uh where would we be uh without the people oh God that you have set our way my father.

Oh Lord God. Uh oh father, my God, my God. Uh what can we say? Oh Lord. Uh for we have a man uh who gave us the six months for knowledge. Oh Lord. Uh we seen a man who said in 6 monthsh something is fixing to happen. My God. And oh Lord God we are past those months. Oh Lord we are past those months. Oh father. And as the days go by, oh Lord, oh father, we find ourselves walking in the king's highway. Uh we find ourselves walking in the light of God. Uh because we have a leadership, oh father, a leadership, oh Lord God, uh that holds us accountable, oh Lord, uh a leadership, oh Father, in whom, oh Lord, we have a shepherd and we know his voice, oh Lord, uh a stranger we shall not follow. Uh a stranger we shall not follow. Thank you for the leadership of Yahweh. Oh Lord God. Oh God, they are sheep. They are wolf in sheep's clothing. Oh father standing at the pulpit this morning. Oh God they are quoting your word. Oh God they are quoting the spoken word. Oh God they are saying this. Oh God they are saying that. But we can say, \"Oh, father.\" We have a man and he's come around and he's called my name. Amen. We glory. Glorios unto the King of Kingsh. Glorios unto the Lord of Lords. For you have given us a leadership, oh Father, that has the oil dripping from the head down. My God. Oh father, flying with both wings, oh Lord. Uh it's not just the mechanics, oh God. Uh we are flying with the mechanics and the dynamics of this ministry, oh God. Uh we have the oil, oh father, we are not like Esau, oh God. But we are like Jacob, oh Father, because we have a man. We have a man that came around, oh father, that you have sent our way. That you have sent our way, my God. Oh my lovely one, all we can do is worship. All we can do is praise.

We can, oh father, rejoice, oh God, for our cups are running over. We are drunk with the wine. This day, my God, this day, Jehovah, this day, my God. Lord I pray therefore for each and every brother and sister my God. Oh Lord God I pray for each and every family. Oh father let us oh God not get any comfortable not get too comfortable. Lord God but let us always find ourselves desperate. Oh father let us find ourselves on our knees. Oh father calling upon the name of Yahweh. Let us find ourselves, oh Lord God, drunk in the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh father, when we come into this house of prayer, may we get as much oil, oh father, into our lamps, oh Lord, as much as we can, oh father, Lord, my God, my God, in our houses, oh God, may the desire, oh father, to watch the storehouse be there in and no desire, oh Lord God, oh father, to prioritize other things about you, my God. May we find ourselves hungering and thirsting for your word and being fed because the room is full of wheat and there is wine and oil all over. You have given us the opportunity oh Lord to top up on the oil to top up on the oil every month. My God may each and every family member from the head of the house of father to the children thereof. Oh God, may we, oh Lord, find ourselves sincere with thee. May we, oh Lord, find ourselves, oh God, at the altar, oh father, may we, oh God, find ourselves on a Wednesday, uh, oh, shouting and jumping and praising the Lord. May we find ourselves as close to God as much as we want to. Oh God, my God. Oh Lord, my God, there are the young ones, oh Lord, and there are those who are old, oh father, who do not have jobs, oh God, I pray, oh father, that you come their way, oh God, for the joy of the Lord is our strength, oh God. Oh God, how can I have joy? Even the joy of the Lord if I don't worship how can I have joy if I don't worship if I don't get under the Holy Ghost how can I be filled with oil how can I be filled with wine how can I go about being drunk in the spirit having joy and eternal emotion therefore my God may you bless the young ones and the old oh God who want to make a living. Oh Lord, may you bless their businesses, oh God. May you bless their jobs, oh Father. Are you bless them with a job, oh God, uh that they may be able, oh father, to be without an excuse, oh God, uh to come unto the house of the Lord, uh and to glorify your name, uh in all of their substance, uh in all of their virtue, uh with all of their heart, my God, uh I ask of thee, oh Father, because they are, oh Father, the pride of the Lord.

The right path of god where we can find ourselves in the right hand of Jehovah. Thy right hand oh God is become glorious in power. Thy right hand oh God had dashed the enemy into pieces. is my God. Oh Lord, oh God, we are partakers of the land. We are not like them who wanted to, oh father, just dwell outside of the land because it's ideal for them and their livestock. We don't want to be like their fathers who give a bad report about the Holy Ghost. We don't want to be like them. Oh Lord, but we want to be like Joshua. We want to be like Caleb. Oh Lord God, we want the land. We want the land. And you have given us the land. Oh father that flows with milk and honey. My God that has the vineyards. Oh father where the wine, oh father is that has the mount of olives. Where the oil is. Oh God, my God, my God. Uh, oh father, my God. Where can we find a ministry like this? Uh, there is nowhere else. Oh father all the places oh God be it in the oh father the United States be it oh Lord God in Europe be it in any part of the north my god oh lord you won't find this placeh you won't find this people you won't find this leadership oh father you will only find it in our tabernacle may it be written in our hearts. And may we never forget it, my God, that we may always find ourselves here. That we may always come here, my God, Lord. My God, we need you more than we need the sunshine. Lord, we need you more than we need the rain. Lord, we need you more than we need the morning, my God. For Lord God, you are the everlasting father. Lord, people come and go, friends come and go, but you are the everlasting father. And oh Lord God, in John chapter 14, behold, you sent the comforter our way. Behold, you sent the spirit of truth our way. Behold, you sent, oh God, the five-fold minister to the five-fold ministry, and you have given him an added gift of wisdom. Oh father, that all things may be made plain unto El tabernacle. Oh Lord, we know about the keystone revelation. We know about evolution, my God. We know, oh Lord, about the oil and the wine. We know about the exposition of the seven church ages. Uh we know about the cloud, my God. We know about the cherubams, oh Lord, that Paul could not speak of particularly. Oh my God, my God. Uh we know, oh father, uh be cause, oh lord, uh you sent a man our way. Uh a man who knows more than we do. Uh a man, oh God, oh God, uh who can never be deceived. Uh oh man. Oh Lord God. Uh oh father who prays. Uh 2:00 a.m. in the morning for my soul. Uh for my soul for my mother's soul. For my brother's soul. Uh for my sister's soul. Oh God. Oh God. Uh the royal priesthood. Adonai. Adonai. You have sent oh father into the area of South Africa. My God. Behold how good it is. Oh Lord, for brothers to dwell together in unity, oh father, and we dwell together, oh God, because there's oil in the camp, my God, the shout of the king is in the camp, Jehovah, the shout of the king is in the camp, my God. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, we thank you, oh God. We thank you, oh God. We glorify your name. We glorify your name. We give you all, oh father, the honor and the glory, oh Lord. I pray that you preserve, oh Lord our God, the life, oh father of the leadership, oh Lord. Oh father, from the head, oh God, unto the lineage, oh father, unto the children's children, oh Lord. Father, we need the roster family. Oh Lord, I pray, oh God, that you preserve their life all the more for us. Oh God, oh Lord God, as you have given Israel, the Levites, surely you give El Tabernacle, the Rosco, my God, and we thank you, oh God, for the Rosco family, oh Lord. Father, they have given us, oh Father, the opportunity to share, oh Father, my God, the apostle with them, oh Lord. Oh God, had it been for them, oh Lord, they could have just lo for themselves. But oh Lord, they don't have an eel spirit. My God, they have a giving spirit. Oh father, and they have given unto me, oh Lord, they have given unto me, the man of the hour. For cometh the man, come at the hour. And in this hour, oh Lord, on a Saturday night, just like last night, oh father, if I was not here, had not a man come around, had not I heard a voice, I was probably going to be in the filth of the world. I was probably going to be in the red districts. Uh I was probably going to be uh in the drinking sessions. Uh I was probably going to be uh oh Lord, where the world music is, my God. But on a Saturday night, on a Saturday night, here comes a manu. A man, and he knows my name, and he knows my name. And he knows my name. And I will be caught up just like brother Brennham was caught up this word. I was caught up into El Tabernacle on a Saturday night. Uh and the blessings of the Lord uh came down not just the birthight but the blessings of the birthright uh because we wrestle with the angel. We wrestle with the angel. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God we wrestle with the angel. Uh and blessings are come upon us. Oh Lord. Oh Lord, we thank you for the man that has taught us how to pray. Oh Lord, oh God, this Bible could just been a story. This Bible could just been a story, my Lord. But now, oh father, the bride, she sees the love letter. She sees the love letter of the bridegroom. She sees the mysteries of God while the world does not see you. Lord, we see you face to face. While Moses could only see the back parts of your mind, the back parts of your body, my God, we see the bosom of God. For you said that you will be with us and in us forever, my God. Not just now but forever my father. So Lord God if they say that we are cults. If they say that we are brainwashed then we oh father are the members of the Lord Jesus Christ. Then we if we are brainwashed we are washed by the blood of the lamb. I'm better off being brainwashed by the blood of the lamb than being brainwashed by the filth of the world. Oh God. Oh God, what good it is? What good is it? Oh father, if I go to hell with a Bible, oh father, what good is it, oh God, if I go to hell still knowing all the commandments? What good is it, oh God, if I open my eyes in hell and all the days of my life? I was quoting brother Brennham. What good is it, oh God, if I don't have the oil? What good is it, oh father, if I don't have the oil? Oh God, my God, give me oil in my lamp. Keep me burning till the break of day. Keep me burning till the break of day. Oh my God. Keep me burning till the break of day. Oh Lord my God. You provide the fire. I'll provide the sacrifice. I will open s inside. My God. I will open up inside. You provide the spirit. Oh God. Thy word is a lamp to my feet. Oh Lord, I need oil. My God, I don't want to open my eyes in hell like the rich young ruler because Oh God, he kept all your commandments, my God. He kept your statutes, my God, you love him, oh God, but he didn't have blood. He didn't have the life in the blood. It didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh God. Oh God. My God. This hidden life in me that's stepping out. This perfect man in the image of the Lord God Almighty. This child of God that is within me is stepping out. And one of these days, one of these days, we will be sweeping the sky. But as long as I'm on the earth, my God, may I b myself. Oh God, worshiping you all the days of my life because it's the only thing I can do. Oh foolish virgins. Oh God, they seek to please you with their eyes and their lips, but they never rendered out their heart. My God. Oh God. Oh God, how fortunate is El Tabernacle? How fortunate am I to be a written apistl? Because I opened the eyes of my heart. I opened my heart unto you and the spirit of the Lord came in. I opened my heart unto you and the spirit of the Lord came in. Now when they ask oh God and they say which king is ruling your life I will say oh my god the hope of glory king Jesus God the god king himself the king of kingsuh he is the ruler of my life because I opened the eyes of my heart and I see him in the compartment of my heart there is oil there is oil in my handh There is oil in my lamb. There is oil in my lamb. Because oh God, thou tabernacle is wise. Thou tabernacle is wise. Oh God, my God, we didn't just take the lamp. We took the extra vessel. Lord, while the world Oh God, they rejected the extra vessel. Oh Lord, while they rejected the extra vessel, while they were satisfied with the light the lamb had, we weren't satisfied. The wise was not satisfied. We couldn't help but take the extra vessel. And the extra vessel, he stands every combined right behind us. And he gives out the oil. And he gives out the oil. Oh my Lord, my God, how can I say? Oh, how I can say like David said, oh thou, oh God, anointest my head with oil. My cup runth over. Oh goodness and mercy, goodness and mercy, goodness and mercy. They follow me all the days of my life because oh God we are not the ones who are sitting in the seat of the scope. Lord my God we are the ones uh oh God. Uh who excites you who entertains the angel. Oh God my God. They didn't want to entertain the angel. They rejected the colored porter because of the color of his skin. But the wise virgin, they took the extra vessel. Because the extra vessel is the baptism of the Holy Ghost, they rejected that container even though they wanted the content there in. But you can't separate the gift from the man. You can't separate the gift from the man. And so we thank you for the man cuz we know, oh God, when the man comes around, something is left behind. Something is left behind. My Lord, eternal life is left behind. The Lord's release is left behind. Oh my God, the workings of the Holy Ghost is left behind because you sent an angel before us. You open the year of 2025 with sending the angel before us to keep us in the way. Because oh Lord, nothing happens unless the angel comes down. And oh God, it is recorded in your Bible. Oh Lord, that the angel of the Lord always comes down. That the angel of the Lord is always in pious skins when he comes down. Oh, how Gideon says he has seen the face of God. Oh my Lord, how Manoah and his wife say, \"Oh, we have seen God face to face. You are the same angel that sits under an oak tree. You are the same angel that stood next to Brother Prenam, God, and heal the people. You are the same angel that we see, oh God, every month. Oh God, every month, oh God, how can we be silent? How can we be silent? How can we sit in the seat of the scornful when we are in the midst of angels? How can we sit in the presence where the oil is dropping down? Oh Lord, oh Lord, may more of the oil fall upon us till we are so slippery, oh Lord, uh that the devil's hands, oh God, they can't even get us, oh father, so slippery with oil, oh God, that he complains and says you lay a hedge around them, oh God. Oh God, keep us, oh God, in the righteous way. Keep us, oh God, in the way of holiness. How can we be holy without the Holy Ghost? My God. You only want to see you, my God. You only want to see you, my father. That's why we plunge beneath the blood, my God. That's why we cover ourselves with the blood, my God. Because red through red makes white, my God. And now, oh father, because the token is applied, the atken, the the atonement is made. The rain, oh God, the letter rain is fallen on us now. Oh God, we have fellowship. Lord, the blood of bulls and goats, they had their time, oh God, it was not enough, oh father, it would just temporarily cover it. Oh Lord, but the blood of the lamb washes me entirely. Behold the saints of God. Though their sins be scarlet, though their sins be crimson, Lord, you washed us whiter than snow. Because you have given us the Lord's release. You have given us, oh father, the workings of the Holy Ghost. Because what is the Holy Ghost given for? Oh Lord God, what is the Holy Ghost given for? That's why we thank you, oh Father. We thank you, oh Lord, for the adoption. Oh Father, we thank you, oh Lord, for the Holy Ghost, my God. We will say it over and we will say it over and we will say it over and over again, my God, because this does not cease. This cannot die. This cannot die. Father, we see how the other movements, oh Lord, uh, how they died off, my God, because the letter killth, my God, but oh father, oh Lord, my God, may those, oh father, who will look, may they behold just like a milliel, will be held and said, uh, if this is of a manuh, it will cease, but if this is of God, it shall not cease. And we have received of the Lord. Uh because we don't just have a man of God. We have a God man. Uh we have a man that is sent our way. We have oh God a mighty angel that's come down. We have oh father the workings of the Holy Ghost. Oh father where we have enough oil to live the life. We have enough oil to love my God. We have enough oil, oh father, to speak life and peace, oh Lord, my God, the blessings of the birthright uh is upon our tabernacle, my God, uh may you equip us well, oh father, with the understanding, oh father, of cherishing the Holy Ghost uh that we, oh Father, may not underestimate, oh Father, what we have, my God, uh there's nothing better in this world, uh than what we have, my God. There's nothing better in this world than the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Uh because when we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, uh Lord, anything we ask in your name, anything we ask in your name. And so, oh Lord, like the songwriters say we will speak Jesus. Uh oh God, because uh we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Uh we have the author of the Bible. Uh we have the oil himself. Uh we have the anointing. Uh we have the Christ. We have Jehovah Rosco. We have Jehovah Gyra. We have Jehovah Ni. We speak Jesus. We speak Jesus. Uh I speak Jesus for my family. I speak Jesus for my brothers. Uh I speak Jesus for my sisters. Uh I speak Jesus. Uh I speak Jesus. Uh I speak salvation. Uh I speak deliverance. Uh I speak healing. Uh I speak power. Power from on high. The power of God is in pure skins. The power of God is in pure skins. So much so when the praises go up, the glory comes down. We bend the heavens like a bow. We bend the heavens like a bow. And the years of Jehovah, they come down. The years of Jehovah, they come down. The angels of the Lord encamp round about the premises and camp around those that fear him. the angel of the Lord and the host thereof, all the multitudes and multitude they come down because you have given us uh the authority to speak Jesus. To speak Jesus I speak Jesus uh for the blind. I speak Jesus uh on the lame. I speak Jesus uh for the weary. I speak Jesus uh I speak Jesus uh I speak Jesus. I speak Jesus uh I speak Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord my God. We speak life into that which is dead. We speak life uh into that which is dead. We speak life uh to a sad marriage. Uh we speak life uh to a parent home. Uh we speak life uh to the left of the lame. We speak life uh to the eyes of the blind. Uh we speak life uh to the heart of the ignorant. We speak life. We speak life. We speak life. We speak life. We speak life. I speak healing. I speak healing. Oh Lord. The healing in the mind. My God. The healing in the flesh. My God. The one who needs healing. May they lift up their hands believing with all of their heart. Believe it with all of their heart. that. Oh my my They speak Jesus. They speak Jesus. They speak Jesus. May we speak Jesus in the trials of our lives. May we speak Jesus. Oh my God. Your name is healing. Your name is power. Oh God, you are holy. My lovely one. Oh lovely one. Lord, had it not been for your grace, I could not stand. The disciples asked, \"Who then can be saved? Who then can be saved?\" Oh God, because the rich young ruler, he valued all the other things instead of the sacrifice himself. But here comes a man saying, \"You can have the whole lamp, but if you don't have oil, he will open your eyes in hell.\" Oh God, I'm thankful. I'm thankful Jehovah. I'm thankful Elohim. I'm thankful Adonai. I'm thankful Hashem because I am one of them who can say I am wise. I am wise because I have the oil. Oh God, my God, as we are about to close, oh father, this wonderful prayer service, oh Lord, I pray that your spirit continues to move even after this all over the face of South Africa. Wherever the streams are, may they speak Jesus. May they speak Jesus, may they not miss their blessing. Oh God, may they not miss their blessing. Oh father, may they catch it through the streams. May they catch it through the streams. Uh may it not be like that sister in brother Brennham's time where she missed the angel because she decided to not entertain the angel. But may we in entertaining the angel receive that which we need. We always need something from you. We always need something from you. Oh lovely one Lord. Oh precious savior, we glory in your name. We glory in who you are. We glory in the name Yahweh. We glory in the name Jehovah Rashco. We glory in who you are. We don't want to see ourselves anymore. Gone is seek. Gone is seek. Gone. Oh father is oh father this person who's of the world but born again is the son of god born again is the son of god anointed to prosper and strong born again is the daughter of god and you have given us power may we go out with power you have given us power the anointing is upon us oh father From the head down. From the head down. Lord my God, the foolish virgin does not know the cost of my alabaster box. My God, the foolish virgin does not know. But my brother and my sister, they know the cost. They know the cost. My God. Therefore, with all of our strength, with all of our heart, with all of our mind, with all of our substance, my God, may we serve you. May we be the living sacrifices. May we be, oh my, oh my, the Christ in the me many membered body. May we be the sons and daughters of God uh walking all over the face of the earth doing the exploits whatsoever we will oh Lord according to thy desire and according to thy will oh father you direct the path oh father for many a man a plans a man has in his heart but you my god you direct the path and you have directed the path of thy tabernacle you have directed the path of our hearts.

Behold, we have the lord shining his face upon us. Lord, Lord, we are not foolish to be buying oil, oh God, at the time when we should be having it. Lord, we are not like the foolish virgin who's going about looking for a false anointing who is going about looking for the riches of the world, but we are like the wise for we find everything in the bridegroom. We seek the kingdom first and we know the rest shall follow. Lord my God, let the one oh father who feels defeated this morning, let the one who's going through the hardest of trials, let the one who has a problem that he's not talking about, let the one who's got an issue that he won't speak out, may those ones uh may they be the ones uh who speak power right now. Uh may they be the ones uh who call upon the name of Jehovah right now. May they be the ones uh to be wrestling with the angel right now. May they be the onesh who are going to get up the eighth time after falling seven times. May they be the sons and daughters who gets up the eighth time and say uh son and moon stand still until I win. May they speak like Stephan.

elections.\nTRANSCRIPT\n========================================\ngood evening El Tabernacle and um listeners around the world that's going to listen to this clip that I made that I'm going to make and um we greet you in the name of our King God the soon coming Messiah to the Jews but first to the Gentiles the Lord Jesus Christ we are actually forced to make this clip because there is still people around going and saying that I prophesied that the Lord is coming and um I think brother Kurt told us not the other day another brother told him and then when the brother went to go check up he saw that I never said a thing like that and he had to phone C back and apologize not in our church in another church the r will also told me a brother told him that and then he told the brother I was in that meeting can you tell me where on that tape does he make that prediction that you're talking about and the brother couldn't answer him so I um I just fell to save God uh our church because I'm not send to these guys in the message you know and I I I have a responsibility uh for my church and uh that's why brother Branham laid hands on me and Prophet visit South Africa because he saw that I would have a church or churches and I will be have to be responsible for them and I will actually preach exactly what he preach or say exactly what he says or prophesy again what Revelations 107 has brought forth so that's why we are just recapping um uh the uh Jubilee message that I preach which has gone around the world everybody heard it and um it wasn't done in secret I preach it all over the world uh I let it go all over the world and uh uh but you know people when you are a Target they try to get any little thing to put on you and make you wrong that's why Jesus says blessed are they if they speak all manner of wrong things lying you know for my name's sake blessed are ye so we thought about recapping just for Al Tabernacle sake and uh I got to a place where I don't care about anybody else if somebody wants to know something I will have all the patience in the world to sit with him if they haven't got to arant Spirit and if they come from other church and try and do my best to show them where we stand and uh without trying to steal Souls but uh time has gone by and uh you don't find people wanting to know more about God they um seated in their churches and their doctrines so that's why I said I I have to care just for El tacle now we have to recap a few things here for a couple of minutes and because people are going around saying I said the Rapture is going to take place last year 2310 2024 last year was 49 years so they were wrong they were lying you know last year was not the 70th Jubilee last year was 49 years you know wedn they were be 50 years but they said I said last year and that just shows you that they do not understand uh the 70th Jubilee and the dates and stuff like that that's why their pastors don't understand it and their pastors can't preach on it and now because I preach on it and I made sense to it I must be attacked and stupid guys would come and you said no don't say that well uh brother Paul says in Galatians who has bewitch you you foolish Galatians you know so were and foolishly attack me and when I said man hey uh 2023 is not the 70th Jubilee then everybody backed off you know and uh it showed me that they didn't understand a bit on what I was saying therefore it is for my church and we don't care what anybody else say about it so they lied about me saying the rapure will take place last year you know and last year was not the 70th Jubilee now this year 2024 which is Wednesday coming is the 70th Jubilee and the changed the tune and said I said the Rapture will take place Wednesday which is another line I have never said a thing like that and uh I cannot understand they call themselves The Bride but they're lying like this they call themselves well we got love but they like like this you don't find love in untruth love rejoice in truth you must speak truth that's love but these all these guys are lying they're a bunch of liars you know and uh to me don't come and preach love to me you know because none of you Sayes it and I proved it What Love Is Love is a baptism of the Holy Ghost full stop nothing more nothing less so that's why we put the clip on social media what I said it's on it's on there for months we checked it up it will be a year and a couple of months that we put the clip up there to explain the whole thing you know and yet they go on for the whole year so how would you miss it if I put the clip on there for the whole year so I got to come back again now and do it again you know so that they could be judged on their lives with their pastors and all second point I invited pastors of other churches to be in that meeting and all our preachers because brother Brandon said said um don't say I said that 1977 the Lord is coming he said he three times in uh Daniel 70 weeks and yet look how the media went on that brother BR prophesied now we're not prophesying I never prophesied and I never said thus say the Lord you know on the 70 weeks of Daniel there nothing like that and brother Bram says he never said it is thus sayth the Lord so uh but they finish him up until we came out with the 70th Jubilee and showed exactly that brother B was right 1977 was a start of the 70th J cuz 1974 it started to 2024 so uh required him down praise God that we could be Protectors of this wonderful message this is the clip we played for months or one year and yet pastors are lying I never change anything it's told the 70th week 70th Jubilee Wednesday coming it cannot be changed you can't shift it because that's the amount of time given to the Jews so nobody can change it it's the 70th Jubilee so this is the club that we played for a year is there a time that men will be cut off according to God's Bible when will the 70th Jubilee be the expected time the desired time for God to come not the desired time that Edgar Rosco said because everybody said something the 7even day Adventist also had a date and it failed the Jehovah Witness had a date and it failed because it was their date but the 7th Jubilee is nobody's date but yahweh's date that's the difference Lord what will the end be go your way there it's concealed until the time of the end when you see a preacher preach on maratha then it sounds for you what will the end be that's why he says it will be the aering in of the Millennium because the 6,000 years is finished we moving into the seventh Hallelujah the only thing that can change that date is the long suffering of Christ nothing more my spirit shall not always strive with men cut off time have you realized that such a short time left in the short time God in the short time amen Los Angeles has to go down in the short time that woman has to raise in America and 2024 is the USA elections again could it be the date that that woman will be elected that will cause America to go down yes B believe yes you will see them going down Los Angeles we are not here forever there must come an appointed time for God to come and close isn't there an appointed time for men on the earth yes there is you have prayed maybe five times a day like the Muslims maybe three times a day like to choose but now you have to pray without ceasing so there you have it we played this for over a year and how could you misunderstand it is my problem it just shows you jealousy and it just shows you that they are looking to get something thing on me so uh I just want to clear it with my people I don't care what the other people say about it I want to clear it with my people which I did so uh that's the clip now the big question is now who said that the 70th Jubilee is the rapture and the ushering in of the Millennium who said that I never did it doesn't come from me then who said it now let's welcome brother brandham to the podium to play Daniel 70 weeks tape now mark down in your book a little scripture here I want to give you Leviticus 25 beginning with the eth verse God called a jubilee every 49th year the 50th year was a jubilee we know that yeah we understand that from the first Jubilee of Leviticus 258 and 1977 will be the 70th Jubilee making exactly 3,430 years amen hallelujah Jubilee means going up amen Rel oh we're watching for the coming of that glad Millennium day when our blessed Lord shall come and catch his waiting briway oh the world is growing crying for that day of sweet release when our savior shall come back to earth again we got 17 years left until 77 will be the 70th Jubilee since the beginning of jubilees amen and what will it be oh brother watch close now don't miss it it'll be the Jubilee of the going up of the Gentile bride and the return of Christ to the Jews am when they go out of bondage amen because Jesus did not say no man could know the year month or week in which his coming was to be completed so I repeat I sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration ation that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and Usher in the Millennium so now I'd like to ask you now who said the 70th Jubilee is the rapture me your Prophet said so so you want to say that I am wrong I don't got it from the prophet yeah you read the prophet said so so blame the prophet if you if you say no no no it doesn't and you got all these other excuses say you against your own Prophet you're talking against your own own Prophet I only quoted what he said it doesn't come from me Paul says that the word of God come out of you or did he come to you this word came to me from brother brandham so brother brandham said it is the rapture not Ed garos so get your facts straight I am quoting your prophet and you can now go against it he'll meet you at the Judgment bar there is make Believers in this message Great Pretenders that they believe the message but they can't even take a quote like this how could they be in the message so you either know the message or you a foolish version in the message or you a great Pretender you're only pretending that you believe the Bible says so BC 538 Gabriel came to Daniel and spoke to him about it the chronologist with a many books says so and now the prophet William Brenham said so July the 30th of the 8th month 1961 said so and I edar Rosco underline it when is the 70th Jubilee 77 is the beginning of the 70th Jubilee because the 70th Jubilee started in 1974 so he said in 1977 we're in the 70th Jubilee so I clarifi that thing so regardless of what you say it's the 70th Jubilee so you going to ask brother Brandon what you want to ask brother brandom don't come and ask me I will speak to my church on Sunday on Saturday at the combined meeting I said it's not my date but it's God's appointed time he can change it in in his longsuffering like I brought it out on that message but in the longsuffering all the times that examples I gave no soul got saved so think about after Wednesday if you don't understand him then it's your baby and your pastor's baby you are trying to too hard to find me wrong and God protected me oh Edgar osar said he's greater than brother brandham he is the eighth messenger is Jehovah God now he said is the rapture is going to take place he's messing around with human like Rin Thompson said he's not that boy in Propet visit South Africa and no proof I ask you please on all those points send me the tape where I said those things is now for how many years you guys cannot produce the tape where I said these things so you will work it on with God very soon at the day of judgment I explained this next Saturday at our combine I'll be and I said in a clip it'll be an ordinary day I would like you to write it down or make an indelible mark on your mind what I'm going to tell you you'll see the 23rd will come it's on the Wednesday I will be here but you'll see it's going to be an ordinary day it's going to look as if nothing has happened yes Mark that [Music] down they'll still have church Elders there's still going to be alter calls there's still going to be people that wants to give their hearts to the Lord the surely is going to be weeping and crying but it's going to be too late for Tears [Music] you mark that down because in that [Music] Dimension it's going to be all [Music] over Israel when God told told them to take the land they didn't and God wanted to destroy them immediately and and Moses begged and he says I won't destroy them but they still going to die they went on for 40 years serving God crying having a prophet eating Mana but they were cut off they died all of them but in the [Music] natural it looked all right and if I am right which I very much doubt I'm wrong I don't know why all the ministers are calling some are calling and some are dying [Applause] it is like that already how is it going to be when the thing is cut off completely in the message World it will go on the same like it goes on every [Music] day but if you're spiritual if you're in this prophetic class [Music] I'm sure you already saw [Music] things so all that I told you to make a mental note and a note in your Bible because it cannot be moved it cannot be changed the time Factor runs out the 23rd one of the Jewish Rabbi said we won't forget the 23rd of October and going to read Daniel 70 weeks God told Daniel there's only 70 weeks allotted to the Jews 70 weeks and not more time they were given 70 weeks that was that time that God was going to take away all transgressions that means that I'll be back with Israel [Applause] read okay that is um what I said in the 70th Chile now the camia ER quote we were first to point out that that quote speak of two women a natural woman that will be chosen vice president and then president and the Roman Catholic church so either Camila or Trump choosing will be bad Trump can bring in the Roman Catholic Church money prosperity and Camila can bring in that woman that will destroy America I said it from that time brother Bram says 1960 the 7 month 16th day he says thus sayith the Lord in other words God said it not brother Brenham God said it there'll be a woman rule a woman rule before the end time listen here before the end time she'll either be president or vice president or the Roman Catholic Church listen there's three important points in this quote Point number one before the end time why does he say before the end time because the seventh vision is the end time the abor the seventh trumpet Revelations 11:14 the Third Woe cometh quickly it comes quickly after her that's the end remember that so her coming in is not the end of the world get me straight please but the bride is gone then when this happens when the bomb Falls when that wo comes remember the bride is gone before the end of the world in other words she won't see the end of the world so brother BR says a woman will rise she'll be he says she'll be president or vice president well she's running for both she already fulfilled the one she is and was the vice president and now she's running to be a candidate for presidency so the quote is running with God's will so far we're going to bring this back again to you her eyes was 1990 Deputy district attorney 20 courtroom prosecutor San Francisco two uh3 district attorney 2010 general attorney 2016 US senator 2020 elected vice president 2024 president candidate isn't the scary straight with the quote anybody can see this could it be El Tabernacle could it be so the quot is running with God's will so far from the same quote from that time he says or the Catholic church so here we see distinctly two woman a natural woman that will be voted in and a spiritual woman which is the Roman Catholic Church that's not voted in she just comes in but the natural woman that will be president she gets voted in so I never saw this just the other day and as I went through the quotes and I think there about 200 or so many quotes or even more uh and all if you read really those quotes you'll see he speaks every time of two human that's why we have two candidates for the two woman one is Trump and the other one is Camila one will be Camila that is voted in so far we see how votes wi the other one might be Trump that will let the Roman Catholic Church come in because of the pressure of the Roman Catholic church because America owes her trillions of dollars they can't even pay back the interest so World should put the screws on Trump if he gets elected and he will give in then to her and afterwards speak as the dragon it's two scenarios here because the Roman Catholic Church when he says the Roman Catholic Church he says I got it in Brackets and you know what that mean I don't have to take it to school so um he says all the Catholic Church to woman then he concludes the quote by saying thus saith the Lord so it must come to pass is this the season for it you might have to check that thing out so the you have 70 weeks 70 Jubilee and also Camila all speaking about the End Time season is Right 70 weeks 70 Daniel is going to be settled on Wednesday and then the elections we're waiting to see which one comes in to bring in one of the two human you know and a person wonders about the Roman Catholic Church Revelations 17 very very much you worried about it but both is a worry But the irony of the thing the bottom line the colel is that we are at the end the ceiling will go on the regardless of what happens the ceiling is going to go on so I would like to on Saturday show you what brother Brenham says what's going to take place if these things fall in line it's only the elections in front of us and then he says something and I feel sorry for the Brethren that's in this message that has rejected the Holy Ghost and actually gone for a Baptist way of worship I feel sorry for them after Saturday you'll see what a mistake they made I can't but help bringing this up and I know I said that I will never mention him again but I think about Raymond Thompson about 15 20 years ago with a h Revelation and I was walking up to him and ask him you see the Holy Ghost never came so the Holy Ghost never came in 1979 when it fell in El Tabernacle and then went over to America and and uh many other places so uh he was very very rude and I'm glad that angel of God was there he wrote everything down he will meet one another there and he said uh you preach what you want to preach we preach what we want to preach and um then that thing didn't work out because it was a bunch of nonsense third phase worship and all that was all nonsense you know so that's why I just wonder if these guys didn't bless from the Holy Ghost and now it's too late to get it I watch them every now and then their services especially when they preach and I don't feel no Holy Ghost there so um we have come to the end it's going to be worse because God is now going to go extra mile with Israel and I want to bring it out next week on Saturday to show you exactly what's going to happen then so may God bless you and um brother the B says in the token this is what he says the sleeping virgin coming in trying to buy oril that is that time when the bride went in and the rest of them was left here did you ever think what happened they went right ahead preaching and thinking they were getting Soul saved and everything and did not know it they knew nothing about it the Church of War thinking souls are being saved and everything else and the church is already the bride sealed away don't know it certainly that's exactly what the scripture Noah went in the ark God seal it out truly and the time will come when men and women will cry to God and even think that they've got something when they haven't it's exactly right the scripture speaks that amen there you have it that is what's going to happen they'll go on with the church services already we know God is gone we already know it everybody knows it all of ministers knows it that God is not there so we need Scripture to back us up there's a quote and I brought out most of the scriptures on Saturday night in uh Dar to show you how God cuts off the holy ghost from the people so you have all those quotes to go with us quote and uh we write at the end it is finished you'll be sealed up with whatever you have I remember years ago brother Raymond Thompson used to like to say in our church be careful what you're doing whatever nonsense you catch on there's going to be a time that the Holy Ghost is going to seal that nonsense in you and you'll never be able to overcome and I want agree with that that is what is going to happen after Wednesday but as I said it already happened we see one another on Wednesday and then Saturday as well and uh we right at the end when the cup of the amorites Wednesday will be full and I'll tell you why I said it will be full God bless you thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music]\n"}, {"id": "2025-08-31 - Special Sunday Morning Service  31 August 2025 - Unknown Speaker.txt", "text":

I wonder this time where we are in as we stand. We're going to welcome brother Y to open the word this prayer meeting in a word of prayer. As we bow our heads and we close our eyes, we all bow and close eyes of Jesus, King God. Heavenly Father, it's truly an honor and a privilege, oh God, to approach your throne of grace, your throne of mercy this morning. Oh God, what can we say after a service like yesterday's? Oh God, we are truly blessed, Lord, to have a leadership, oh God, a man of God sent by you, oh Lord. We thank you for him. We pray that you may strengthen him, oh God. You undertake for him. May you guide him in every step of the way. May you just strengthen each and every bone, every fiber in his being. You go before the Rosco family. May you be with him. Keep them in the palm of your hand and my savior. Please, Lord Jesus. May you be with the tabernacle this morning. You fill us with the Holy Ghost. Lord God, we lift up our vessels toward you, oh God. We submit ourselves to you, oh God. Lord Jesus, King God, in everything that we do today, may it all come together in order to give you all the glory, the honor, and the praises. Lord, we ask this in God's name. Amen and amen. Church, don't you just appreciate God's apostle for the powerful message he gave us yesterday? Then you turn around in your homes and just give God, your neighbor, a wonderful hug. Say, \"I love you. I appreciate you.\" Just tell your loved one next to you, \"I appreciate you with my whole heart.\" as we sing. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. [Music] Sing it with me. Sing holy, holy, holy are you, Lord. Holy, holy, holy are you, Lord. [Applause] The other angels bow the redeemed worship. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Sing with me.

Oh, holy you Lord. Singing holy, holy are you, Lord. Oh, the earth angels b the red worship you. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Can we give God a handy praise? [Music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So good to be in his house this morning on the Sunday sunrise morning. Many people didn't wake up this morning but we thank God that we could see another sunrise, another morning where the sun has risen in our lives. the son called Beth, the son of the living God. We want to say thank you to Jesus, King God, this morning for waking us up and how blessed we are after this combine to hear God's servant to hear the apostle preach a masterpiece. And I could only think last night about of how he threw out theology, threw out tradition out of the water. And it just shows you that if you a son and a daughter of God, if you come from God and you're going back to God again, there's no tradition, there's no situation on earth that you can say this is the way I am. But we've learned the character of Jesus Christ. We've learned the nature of Jesus Christ through a ministry, through a vessel, through an apostle. And I just want to thank God this morning for true leadership because it shows you that there's only one garment. It shows you there's only one way to enter in, and that's through this ministry. Hallelujah. And this morning I just want to start off with a quotation, two quotations and two scriptures before we go into the prayer. It made me think of prophet visit South Africa. Um brother Brandham says during another meeting in Johannesburg, a young boy about seven or eight years old was called up in a prayer line. A prayer line. A prayer line. But the Brandham spoke to the boy for a few minutes explaining that the weak heart which he had was caused by demon oppression. And the apostle said a while back he said that to know the depths of God, you need to know the depths of Satan. And I thank God for an apostle that knows the depths of Satan, that took us out from all our demonology, that showed us the way. Hallelujah. He told him that he would be delivered someday would be preaching and he would be preaching the exact same gospel that was being brought to the people of South Africa. Suddenly, brother Brandham turned to the audience and during a few minutes or moments of silence, it was evident that he was seeing a vision of something over the audience. In other words, the weak heart of the apostle. It's something that he knows the stories we've heard growing up. He knows the underworld. He knows the other side. And I just want to thank God this morning that we have an apostle. We have a leader. We have someone that can take us out from where we came from, from all the things we believed. It just shows you that we have the right ministry. And this morning, I have a grateful heart, a thankful heart. And just one more quotation before I read the scripture. The world is again falling apart. They have a refreshed anointing, anointed word of promise for this age. And he is always the word. If God sent us an anointed promise word again for this age, in other words, you cannot have an anointed age, you cannot have an anointed man, you cannot have an anointed word without the oil. You need the oil to anoint the word. In 1946, he would be the same as he was when he come in the beginning, the anointed word for the age. And El tabernacle, we've got the anointed age. We've got the anointed word and we've got the anointed man. We've got the oil this morning. So, right there in your home, may you reach out this morning. And I believe there's no ministry like this. It's evident that we have the token. Hallelujah. The word of the Lord says in Luke the 18th chapter and he said and spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought to always pray and not faint. You always got to pray. You don't have to faint this morning. saying, \"There was in a city a judge which fearth not God, neither regarded man, and there was a widow in the city, and she came and said unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary, and ye would not for a while, but afterwards he said unto him, Though I fear not God, nor regard men, yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continually coming, she worry me. And we were taught that whatever you ask God in prayer, you ask and you ask and you ask until God answers that prayer. And this morning, we want to wear him this morning. We want to ask God this morning. We want to plead our case this morning. Hallelujah. One more scripture before we go into the prayer. Judges 16 verse 26. And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them. Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And there were upon the roof about 3,000 men and women that beheld while Samuel Samson made sport. And Samson called unto the Lord. He prayed and said, \"Oh Lord God, remember me. I pray thee the strength and strengthen me. I pray thee only this once, oh God. He asked for a once more, Lord. And this morning, we want to ask for a once more, Lord. Because I believe that in this house, there is someone in this house that standing between the pillars, the vessel of oil. There's a pot of oil in our house this morning. And I believe we have the right pot of oil. We have the right vessel that can answer our need. Just there in your home, wherever you are. There's no moment like this moment. There's no moment like the present time you're in right now. As the apostle said yesterday, he said it's about the today. It's a fresh anointing. So why don't we pull down that fresh anointing when you go to work on a Monday, on a Tuesday, no matter what moment you're in. The fact that we saw the sun come up this morning, it's a new day. It's a new chance. It's a new opportunity to show the Messiah that we are alive. As we bow our heads this morning, gracious eternal heavenly father. Lord, you are wonderful. Lord, you are God, Lord. You are the mighty conqueror. You are the prince of peace. You are the lily of the valley. You are the bright, the morning star. Father, this morning we humble our hearts to your throne. We thank you that we could feel the brush of angels wings. We thank you Lord that we know which kingdom we belong to. We thank you this morning Lord that we know that our answer Lord is found in you oh Lord Father. And this morning we want to say that we love you. We appreciate you Lord. Lord as your people has gotten up this morning Lord to plead their case Lord. We realize Lord that we are in a ministry father that has the answer Lord. Lord we are in a ministry Lord that we know that we know that we know that you have made a way for us. Oh Father Lord you have called us oh Lord. Lord you have washed us Lord. You have made us whole Lord. And this morning we humble ourselves to your throne. Thanking you Lord that you are not just a God that we do not see but we feel you Lord. We see you Lord. We know that you are there Lord. And just to know that we have the opportunity this morning that we have the opportunity father Lord to come into your courts Lord with thanksgiving and a joyful heart. Lord, we are so grateful this morning because you are our God, Lord. Lord, we do not believe in fables, Father, but we know that there's a land beyond the river called somewhere, somewhere somewhere, Lord. And we want to say thank you this morning for your house, oh Lord. We want to say thank you this morning that you are God, Lord. Lord, you are so wonderful. You are so kind. You are so gentle. You are our savior. You are our king Lord. And this morning we humble ourselves to your throne. Knowing Lord that our strength, knowing that our joy, knowing that a brand new touch is in stock for us this morning, Lord. Lord, and we cannot sh to declare that you are with us, Lord. Lord, we cannot help ourselves this morning because we realize, Father, that you made a way through it all. Through it all, through it all, Lord, when we were at our lowest, you came our way, Father. And this morning, we want to say thank you, Lord. We want to lift you higher. We want to lift you even the more because you are a good God, Lord. Lord, and you are a wonderful God, Lord. Lord and you are a blessing in our lives, Lord. Lord, we do not want to just leave you one side, Father. But we want to embrace you this morning. We wanted you to come and kiss each and every heart in each and every home. May you come with a fresh anointing. Lord, may you come and visit El Tabernacle this morning, Lord. Lord, we want to say you are God. You never changed. We want to say that you are our Lord and you never change, Lord. Lord, you are still the same this morning. You are still the same God in our lives. And we want to lift you higher this morning. We want to give you the Tahilas this morning. We want to give you the toas this morning. We want to say, Lord, even so, come Lord Jesus. Because in you there's life. In you there's another chance in you, Father God. There is there is there is something Lord in the nothing. Oh Lord, there is always something in nothing, Lord. Lord, you are always there when we least expect it, Father. Lord, and your people this morning, we want to say we are your people, Lord. We want to say we love you this morning. We want to say we appreciate you, Lord. We want to say you are God this morning. Lord, we do not want to replace you. We know that you are a jealous God. Lord, we know that you are a jealous God. Lord, let us not put anything in your place this morning, but let us come with a made up mind that we know that we know that we know who our creator is, who our father is. Lord, you said ask and it shall be given unto you. You said knock and I will open the door. You said walk through the Red Sea. I will make a way, Lord. And this morning we know that there is a power from on high. We do not need a song this morning. We do not need anything from this world, but we have the answer. We have the oil. We have the anointing. We have the brush of angels wings. Father, this morning we humble ourselves. We speak the word, Lord, and we taking a positive step in the right direction, Father. Lord, may you forgive us where we fail you. May you try us out even the more, Lord, because we love you, Lord, because we want to be right, Lord. Lord, you said in your word that a Christian falls seven times. A righteous man, he falls, Lord. But we know the answer, Father, this morning. We know that we just got to get up again. We know that we just got to dust ourselves off and you will step in, Lord. You will bless the upkeep, Lord. You will bless the man of the house, Lord. As we look to your servant, Father, as we look to this ministry, Lord, we know that the hope that we have, it make us not ashamed. This morning we know that we have a hope. This morning we know that we have the answer. This morning Lord, there is no devil in hell that can keep a child of God bound because we know where our power comes from. We know where we come from and we know where we are going to this morning. Set the people free this morning. On the Sunday morning. on the Sunday morning, on the S O N. Lord, may you walk in our lives. May you ride in our lives, Lord, as the son of righteousness with healing in his wings. Lord, if there's someone this morning that needs healing this morning, Lord, if there's someone that needs a touch this morning, Lord, if there's someone that needs your heart to come to them this morning, Lord, may you open up the windows of heaven, may you open up the windows of heaven this morning, sister, my brother, may you touch the hem of his garment. He's not too far. He's not too far to hear your heart's cry as you touch him this morning. My sister, my brother, he's there. He's there. He's there. Lord, if there's someone this morning that needs a brand new touch, may you touch them even the more. May you come their way. Lord, if there's someone that needs a job this morning, Lord, may you come and may you intercede, Father. May you open up a company for that person, Lord, because you are still a creator, Lord. You are still a provider. You are still Jehovah Shabba, Jehovah Ni, you are still God this morning, Lord. I pray if there's someone that needs a brother and a sister, Lord, and doesn't know which way to go, may you help them to find you on their knees, Lord, as you reveal to them in prayer, Lord. May the signs come through. May the signs and the wonders come through because what God has put together, let no man put us under, Lord. You know who that brother and that sister is. May you be Lord with every brother, every sister that has a mind battle this morning, Lord, Lord, that doesn't know where they are, Father. May they make up their minds. May they look to the cross. May they look to the strength, Lord, in that Holy Ghost dove. Lord, may you open up heaven for them this morning, Lord. If there's anyone that's afflicted with demon oppression, with demon oppression this morning, may you come their way, may you be, Father God, the powerhouse this morning. Because Lord, we know where our power lies, oh Lord. Lord, we know which kingdom we come from. We know that on Saturday night, Lord, you went down to hell, Lord, and you kicked open the door, Lord, and you took the keys of hell, death, and the grave, Lord. There is no devil. There is no demon that you haven't seen before. Lord, there is no demon in hell that you do not know. Lord, when you were on earth, you came, Lord. And the demons cried out. Have you come to torment us already, Lord? They know you. They know you, Lord. Lord, and I know they know us, oh Lord. They know the power in this church. They know the power in this man. They know the power in the vessel because there's only one vessel of oil. Lord, may the oil. May the anointing break the yoke as the anointing breaks and it breaks and it breaks, Lord. May you break it this morning, Lord. Whatever they going through, whatever they facing, may you break the yoke of the enemy in the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. There's only one name. There's only one name, Lord, that shakes, Lord. And we know, we know, we know, we know that you've come down. You've come down. You've come down to bless us, Lord, to commute with us, Lord. You've come down, Lord. May you bless your children. Bless El tabernacle. Bless us even the more because we know where the power comes from. We know it comes from the head, even the head of Aaron, the high priest. I pray that the blessing may flow Lord from this priest Lord the apostle of God Lord your vessel for this hour your messenger your messenger of the latter rain there is coming another ball there is coming another message bleeding eagle and Lord we are loving in the manifestation of the prophecy Lord our eyes have behold Lord, our eyes have beheld. You have come down. And we want to say as El tabernacle, Lord, you've called us for a time like this. You've called us for a man like this. You've called us to stand upon the promises of God. Lord, if my mother doesn't want to do it, if my uncle doesn't want to do it, I will stand. Lord, Lord, we're not looking to the left. We're not looking to the right, but we are holding on to the promise of God because we know where the power comes from. Lord, may you set free. May you set free this morning. May you set free. Set free. Set free in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We love you. We love you. We appreciate you. We thank you, Lord, for a vessel. We thank you for the oil. We thank you for the house. Lord, we know that we have found someone that can stand between the pillars. They can stand between the pillars, the seven pillars, the seven thunders, Lord. And he knows how to handle the word. Lord, we want to say thank you. We want to say thank you that in this house there is seven pillars. We want to say thank you that we have the pot of oil in the house. We want to say thank you that we know who we are. We want to say thank you that we are not shaking. We are not shaken, Lord, but we are standing on the promises of God. May you come and deliver the young people this morning. Lord, may you come and set them free. May you come and do something exploits in their lives. Lord, may they know that they know that we are not just soul, but we are an army. We are the sons and the daughters of God. May you bless the church. May you bless every brother, every sister. Lord, we love you this morning, Lord. We appreciate you this morning. You are our God. Lord, in you there's life. In you there's another chance. In you there's a sweet anointing. In you there's a fresh touch. In you there's hope. And we want to say thank you. We want to say thank you. We want to say thank you. We want to say thank you. We want to say thank you. We want to say thank you once more, Lord. Just once more, Lord. Just once more, Lord. As Samson cried out, Lord, just once more, Lord. A fresh touch, Lord. A new anointing, Lord. Just once more, Lord. Just once more. Just just just once more. May you be with us. May you touch us this morning, Lord. As we feel your anointing, as we feel the presence, Lord. It is not something that we can wake up. It's something that's within us, Lord. Something that's pushing out, Lord. It may push out this morning. In every home, in every situation, may the angel of the Lord push through. Push through. La just push through the mud. Just push through. Push through. Just push through this morning. You just about to see the sun. You're just about to see the sun. Why don't you push through this morning? He's all you need. He's all I ever needed. He's a wonderful God. He's the mighty conqueror, the prince of peace. We love you this morning, Lord. We appreciate you this morning. We want to say thank you, Lord, for the Holy Ghost. We want to say thank you for the vessel this morning. We want to say thank you that you've come our way in the good times, in the bad times. Lord, we feel like Job of old, Lord. Job, Lord, no matter what he was going through, no matter what happened, Lord, he said, I know that my redeemer loveth, Lord, and we know that we have a hope this morning. We know that we got a hope this morning. We know there's more that's found in you, Lord. No matter what comes our way, no matter what the enemy puts in front of us, we are not going to deteriorate this anointing, Lord, we're going to keep it, Father. There's just a little oil left, Lord. Lord, may we embrace it this morning. May we kiss it this morning. May we embrace it even the more, Lord. We found it, Lord. It has found us, Lord. Lord, we are your people, Lord. called by your name, Lord. And in your name there is hope, Lord. Lord, we want to say thank you this morning. Thank you for your anointing. Thank you for your anointing. Thank you for your vessel, Father. You be with us this morning. May you be with every brother, every sister. Lord, whatever we going through, we want to also say thank you Lord for all your blessings. Father, if we can only sit back and realize what you've done in our lives, Lord, if we can only take a halt this morning and sit back and look at the hand of the Lord in our lives, Lord. You've done so much for us. You've come our way, Lord, and we are still here. We are standing on the promises, Lord. May you be with your people. May you be with El Tabernacle. May you be with every brother, every sister, every brother, every sister. Lord, may you know, Lord, that we are here. Lord, may you kiss our hearts this morning. Lord, may you open up heaven, Lord. May you smile on us today, Lord. I can imagine how heaven feels when they see a true son and a daughter of God worshiping you because that's your answer. That's your your weakness. It's the worship of El Tabernacle this morning that kisses your heart, Lord. Lord, and you give us back, Father God, a fresh anointing because we worship you, not just by word, Father, but by the spirit within us, Lord, manifested this morning. We want to say thank you for your anointing. We want to say thank you for this apostle. We want to say thank you for this church. We want to say thank you for your sweet, sweet, sweet anointing. Lord, we love you. Lord, we appreciate you. May you come by. May you come by. Come by. Someone is calling you. Come by, Lord. Just the once more. Just the once more. just the once more. Lord, we love you this morning and we appreciate you. We are thankful. We are blessed. We are not deteriorated. We know who we are. We know who we are this morning. Lord, may you bless your people.

Can we turn to Psalm 1919? If you add it, the heavens declare the glory of God, his handiwork. Day unto day utter speech, and night unto night show with knowledge. There is no speech nor language where the voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth and the words to the end of the world. In them as he set a tabernacle for a son wishes as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoices as a strong man to run a race. His going forth is from the end of heaven, and his circuit unto the end of it, and there is nothing from the heat thereof. The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. &gt;&gt; The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing his heart, the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever. The judgment of the Lord are true and righteousness altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yay, than much fine gold. Sweeter also than the honey and the honeycomb. Moreover, by them is thy servant worn. And in keeping of them there is great reward. &gt;&gt; Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults. &gt;&gt; Keep back thy servant also from presumptions of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in my sight. Oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. What a beautiful psalm. Hallelujah. If you have a need tonight, there's elders while they prepare themselves. Let's just wave our hands. &gt;&gt; We have a shepherd tonight. &gt;&gt; He goes before me. &gt;&gt; He goes before me. &gt;&gt; Just wave your defender behind me. Defender behind me. &gt;&gt; Oh, I won't fear. &gt;&gt; I won't fear. &gt;&gt; I'm filled with anointing. &gt;&gt; I'm filled with anointing. &gt;&gt; And my cup's overflowing. My love's overflowing. &gt;&gt; No weapon can harm me. &gt;&gt; No weapon can harm me. &gt;&gt; Oh say I want thee. We sing hallelujah. I alone. &gt;&gt; He's my comfort. He's my comfort. [Music] &gt;&gt; He always guides me. You always guide me through mountains and valleys and [Music] his joy is refreshing. [Music] &gt;&gt; He restores my soul. [Music] Oh, mercy for &gt;&gt; mercy and [Music] shy. [Music] Heat. Heat. Oh, [Applause] [Applause] heat, heat. Heat. [Music] Heat.

So I walk [Music] [Music] I need I need I need [Music] My victory say my victory mighty mighty say hallelujah. You might [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hold me close.

We can tell him he's wonderful. Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. What an atmosphere. What a house. It's good to be in this house and we look forward to our father speaking to us. So, let me do my part. Get out of the way so we can all be blessed tonight. Please allow me greet every brother, sister in the beautiful name of Jesus Christ. Please allow me to read the prayer request. We give God a wonderful hand. Then we read a prayer request. We pray and get out of the way. Thankful. God bless you saints. I would like to thank the Lord. Uh this night I made my request known to God before the saints. I was writing this week from Tuesday until today. On Sunday, I submitted a prayer request for God to undertake for me since I was scared and panicking. The Lord is good. All these four days, I could come out of the test room with an hallelujah in my heart because he was there to see me through. Sister Michelle, greetings, saints.

Please remember in prayer my neck and shoulder and body is full of pains. I believe when the saints begin to pray, God will heal me completely. your sister in Christ, Sister Felicia Lane. If you have a request, if you have a need, I can only remind you that early this morning, our friend went in and he prayed for us. And I just come to be a little better behind him. So, lift up your hearts, lift up your hands, don't be weary. know that we have a friend. A righteous man's reward is with our friend. Let us pray. Kind one, lovely one, beautiful one. Lord, thou art our God, our father. We come to you in confidence. We come to you knowing that you are alive. We come to you Lord knowing that in this house you are a present tense God. You are not a God of history Lord but oh God the testimonies the living testimonies are walking amongst us Lord as the angels has touched many and even tonight the angels are walking up and down the aisles touching your children. Oh God, our prayer is Lord, manifest what your apostle prayed for already this morning. Lord, as I lay my hands on the request that I've made known, doubtless thou art our father and I believe, Lord, may they come back with a testimony, giving glory to you, Lord, bless your apostle, our friend. Lord, energize his body tonight, oh God, as he brings the unsearchable riches of God to us. Lord, bless also the house of Rosco. Bless the priesthood, Lord. Bless from the youngest to the oldest in the household of Rosco. Bless your children, oh God. As we come together in this house to bring glory to you, may the praises go up higher and higher and higher tonight, oh God, in the name of Jesus, King God. Amen. [Music] Oh my appreciate our elders tonight. Hallelujah. Do you feel like going on tonight? Hallelujah. There's no place like El Tabernacle going on. Oh, I feel like like going on. Don't you feel like that? Though trials come on every man I feel love. I wonder this time we can welcome our senior pastor Jonathan Rosco. Oh, I feel &gt;&gt; I feel [Music] [Applause] I feel [Music] Do you feel like going on? [Applause] [Music] You ought to forget about your trials. You made it to the house of the Lord. [Music] Amen. [Music] Brother, sister, you may be seated today. [Music] Praise the Lord. We um just want to tell the church about four testimonies that God has done in this time which is resounding beyond explanation and it's just gives us faith to believe no matter what. God is in charge of everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a policeman in Bora. Do you know what's his name? High ranking policeman. Amen. Can you stand to your feet? I saw him come in earlier. God bless you. I was supposed to give this testimony. Thank you, my brother. We were in Ptoria. The man of God was pressed by the Holy Ghost to get to Ptoria on a Tuesday night and he was dealing with cases and the atmosphere was resounding. It was God in the house although the church was not there but God was at the church. And my precious brother came in, heard that the apostle was in the house of Al Tabernacle on the hill. [Music] And the doctors checked his heart and he was supposed to get a booking to do something on the heart. And the man was shook up because they checked them all the time because in the police force they check them and he was getting himself ready for an operation. But they the devil lost out because the doctor was at the church [Applause] and he said, \"Uh, I don't know how am I going to get this booking. There's no place to get me a booking.\" He got the booking and the doctor checked him and he says, \"You got a baby heart after the apostle prayed.\" [Applause] From a problem to a miracle. It was an instant miracle. [Applause] I know he'll never be the same again because that was God. [Music] He believed that if the apostle he came to the house and he knew the apostle was there and he knew if the apostle pray for him, he won't need an op. And God gave him a baby. The doctor was confused and he's still here. Amen. Am I right, my brother? There's a man with the testimony. Amen. Then brother Daniel, the electrician wife had to go for ops and the last op was quite serious with the cancer. Came for prayer. God made a way. You will ask and God will give it. Normally when the cancer spreads in the woman, it goes to the organs. It goes all over. But God made a way. Then the devil wasn't happy with the testimony. Then brother Daniel was busy grinding to make a carport at home and the ladder swept out under him and the grinder cut him here near the juggler pipe. When he got to the hospital it was already bubbling here. The doctors could not believe the man was alive but there was a god in the house. Instead of a funeral, instead of the juggler pipe, God stopped him to die and bleed to death. The grinder cut him, but God was in here. And God saved him. God made a way for him. And I want to tell you tonight, he can make a way for you also. You just got to believe in a man. All things are possible. Praise the Lord. But the strike foster phoned me to say his wife needs to go for an operation. They detected cancer in her breast. And I told the apostle, the apostle told me, \"Jaw.\" The apostle calls me Jaw. It's my house name. &gt;&gt; Jo. She'll be all right. I just said it to him. The apostle told me she'll be all right. Now, I'm here tonight to tell you she went in the Tuesday, the Wednesday, she was home. All things are possible if you believe there's a God, a doctor, a physician in this house. God bless you. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise and you can go home with an answer as well. [Applause] [Music] We should be running around this place. Hey. Hey, Dr. Los. [Applause] [Music] Somebody say hallelujah. Somebody say hosana. [Applause] [Music] Woo. [Applause] We just want to use this opportunity to welcome all the visitors in the house of Rosco. There's a very special gentleman, Mr. Desmond Gil. He's one of the top golfers that plays with the morning stars in our midst. We want to acknowledge you and we want to welcome you and may you enjoy yourself. [Applause] [Music] This is your father's [Music] Oh my [Music] god. [Applause] Holy [Music] Ghost might [Music] be.

I want to say good evening &gt;&gt; wherever the streaming goes right around the world. &gt;&gt; Just want to tell you This is the night and the day &gt;&gt; when the King of glory [Applause] &gt;&gt; cried out, &gt;&gt; \"It is finished. Lord, I am finished. It is finished. &gt;&gt; Redemption pay. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're glad you come from the east and west. You come from lands of far. &gt;&gt; You fly in, &gt;&gt; you bus in, &gt;&gt; you train in, you taxi in, you coober in to one place to be here tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anyway, we together again &gt;&gt; just praising the Lord. And if we have visitors here &gt;&gt; and you don't understand why we're making such a lot of noise, &gt;&gt; we just want to tell you, &gt;&gt; we're excited about that man. We uh we came back a little late last week after the party and then I relax and I put on football. Uh that's my my weak spot &gt;&gt; and uh yet Chelsea and Liverpool &gt;&gt; was playing. And brothers and sisters, it was it was chaos. It was total madness &gt;&gt; because a little Brazilian on the last minute scored the winning goal. &gt;&gt; And when that ball went in, I sat back. I said, \"Now I want to see the spectators or the bartakers.\" I didn't see any spectators. I only saw bartakers. They were jumping. But &gt;&gt; but don't tell J I was one of them that was jumping cuz I'm glad those guys lost. [Applause] But the thing hit me again once more. They could jump like that for a piece of leather. What about us? Why can't we jump? [Applause] and especially &gt;&gt; to the one &gt;&gt; that conquered [Applause] &gt;&gt; hell, &gt;&gt; dead, and the grave. [Applause] Bullmont. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Jonathan told you about those miracles that took place. &gt;&gt; But I heard about Father Kirkwin's wife, Mercedes. &gt;&gt; She had a very, very bad kidney problem and they wanted to put her on dialysis. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when she went, I think a week or two ago, they checked her up and they can't believe it that the kidneys is more stronger than ever. There's a God in this church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I thank God for the healing &gt;&gt; and um I just like to thank the um trustees wives and that when I come to church there's some coffee for me behind in the minister's room. Now I don't have a buffazi. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So when I come most of the time they come through but when I come here I get a nice cappuccino. God bless you as you go out of your way. If I am a man of God, &gt;&gt; now listen, &gt;&gt; listen. I'm here 62 years. &gt;&gt; I never came for your woman. I can look at every woman straight in the eye here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I never came for your woman. &gt;&gt; 62 here. &gt;&gt; And you guys that's got some money in the bank. I know all of you. I never one time knock at your door for money. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So I also didn't come for your money. But I came &gt;&gt; to see you Hello. Ready? [Applause] And then it's brother Julian. Yeah. Julian Bolton. Julian who move you to after 8 you know I just hope that uh that's not backsliding you know I want to thank Julian and brother Charles's wife for the printing of the books I never even read these books so next week you know I've been very very busy &gt;&gt; so next week I have to sit now look how thick this book is. And this is my ministry. My heart is aching to go into this book. And Julian, I would like to know what is this book going to cost? We want to see if we can't make it available to the church at a reduced price. But everybody should have this As you know, all the books that we have printed and all the tapes that I made, over 3,000 tapes, I didn't get one cent from it. I don't get the money. [Applause] We put it back into the works of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then he made another book, the trumpets [Applause] which I didn't have an opportunity to get into it. And I think there's another book So, normally I knock these things off quickly so that they get printed, but they've been waiting on me. I've been in the pulpit most of the time, but I hope next week I'll be able to go into it and we'll tell you what it's going to cost and what we're going to reduce on it. So, I want to thank you, brother Julian. Amen. That concludes my announcements. And now let's get into business. &gt;&gt; Why we are here tonight. I would like to read two scriptures. Matthew 25:10, Revelations 4:1. And I had phone calls from all over &gt;&gt; just on what we already preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what we preach here &gt;&gt; is not preached anywhere. Psalm. Let us read the scripture of a message from the Lord. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; If you can help me to read Matthew 25:10. Let's read. [Applause] Watch that. &gt;&gt; They went into the marriage &gt;&gt; and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; That means just before the door got shut, &gt;&gt; the door was open. And they went in. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Went in with him. &gt;&gt; The bride and the groom &gt;&gt; went into the marriage with him. and the other five virgins was outside the door. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So that means right there the oil change their bodies [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; otherwise they can't go in &gt;&gt; the quickening power &gt;&gt; change their bodies. so that they can go in &gt;&gt; with the lamb. &gt;&gt; So before we go in, &gt;&gt; we need the oil, the Holy Ghost to quicken our bodies to go in. Amen. &gt;&gt; The other scripture, Revelations 4:1, read come up where he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, the door was open &gt;&gt; and she come in. &gt;&gt; Same like Matthew 25. [Applause] What a thing. &gt;&gt; Now I want to say this. Let us pray first. Father, we are just nothing in front of you. &gt;&gt; Anything that we have and will have &gt;&gt; was because of you. &gt;&gt; We pray that you would undertake for us. Bless the people. &gt;&gt; Let us come this Friday night to be assembled together. &gt;&gt; We have church on a Friday night. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because it all happened on a Friday. &gt;&gt; May you bless the word and may we go out here more wiser. I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, each one of you is here tonight, &gt;&gt; whether you on the streaming, &gt;&gt; whether you're in England, America, wherever this broadcast goes, &gt;&gt; whether you're on the streaming in South Africa tonight, &gt;&gt; each one of you, &gt;&gt; every one of you, &gt;&gt; each one of you here in the church, today. &gt;&gt; Every one of you [Applause] &gt;&gt; that came to church today, &gt;&gt; you just accepted an invitation of God. So give yourself a hand clap. &gt;&gt; You just accepted &gt;&gt; an invitation &gt;&gt; from the greatest man. that ever learn &gt;&gt; because he told you come unto me all he that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. come an invitation and you came tonight accepting the invitation. Hallelujah. Bye. [Music] As you see that day approach on Matthew 25, &gt;&gt; see that you assemble together because it's the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Assemble together. You accepted the invitation. &gt;&gt; Let us make full use of it. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus, King God, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; never turn down an invitation. You invite him, &gt;&gt; he'll come. &gt;&gt; He'll come. &gt;&gt; He'll come. &gt;&gt; And now we say the same thing. If you invite us, &gt;&gt; we'll be here. and therefore &gt;&gt; I chose &gt;&gt; and entitled this message &gt;&gt; the greatest &gt;&gt; message &gt;&gt; ever preached. Hallelujah. and for inspiration, the prophetic insight &gt;&gt; in Matthew 15. &gt;&gt; Now, you can't have a message &gt;&gt; unless you have a messenger. [Music] [Applause] And I know that there's a lot of messages. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of preachers &gt;&gt; in the pulpit tonight &gt;&gt; and tomorrow &gt;&gt; and Sunday. &gt;&gt; A lot of preachers. And as I told Daniel that year, I said, Daniel, you know, there's a lot of lot of preachers, &gt;&gt; in the message &gt;&gt; and in the denominations &gt;&gt; and in the churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That they put there &gt;&gt; and that feed them garbage. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So if you have a preacher &gt;&gt; that feed you garbage, &gt;&gt; then you have just you just got yourself a higher killer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; He is in the pulpit &gt;&gt; for ulterior motives. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; He's in the pulpit to kill the church. &gt;&gt; He's in the pulpit to better himself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And they are hired killers. Amen. &gt;&gt; They kill the children of God. &gt;&gt; And you say, \"What do you mean, brother Brandham? Preach a message. I indict this generation &gt;&gt; for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\" And the Bible says there where Jerusalem, they who the hire killers crucified the king of glory. Who crucified him? Priest &gt;&gt; hired killers, &gt;&gt; but an eel tabernacle. There is a man I can turn on the light. Say amen somebody. So, &gt;&gt; we did explain &gt;&gt; with an interview with Edgar &gt;&gt; the prophetic insight &gt;&gt; and why we're going to preach on &gt;&gt; the greatest message &gt;&gt; ever preached. Now before preaching this message, &gt;&gt; we will need tonight &gt;&gt; to have an introduction into it. &gt;&gt; It's too great and I can't I can't wait &gt;&gt; for the next meeting when I'm going to go into it. &gt;&gt; But tonight is just the introduction. So 40 years ago, I told you El Tabernacle &gt;&gt; that I do not go into the study go looking for a message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When I go into the study, I already have my message &gt;&gt; because your message comes from God. &gt;&gt; It's a inspiration from God. &gt;&gt; I already have a message. &gt;&gt; But when I go into the study, &gt;&gt; I write down my sermon. And when I come to church, I deliver the sermon. But the message come from God. &gt;&gt; That's why we sang. There is a message &gt;&gt; from the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A message unto you. This pooper dreams. So &gt;&gt; I need to remind you &gt;&gt; that the prophet calls all the other messages outside of Revelations 10. &gt;&gt; You'll never hear any minister preach on Revelations 10. &gt;&gt; And neither you're going to get it from a Bible school, &gt;&gt; neither from a university, &gt;&gt; neither from a professor. They don't touch Revelations 10 and they don't touch Matthew 25. But here we're in the University of eternity. And the prophet says in Revelation series 19:16, organizations and their flowery messages &gt;&gt; won't shake the devil &gt;&gt; over the head. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Is flowery messages. &gt;&gt; People come in just the way they go out &gt;&gt; and they go out just the way they come in. &gt;&gt; Why? That flowery messages is doing nothing. &gt;&gt; We don't need flowery messages. We don't need intellectual speeches. But we need the Holy Spirit to enter in to the message and bring a shaking that it'll shake you and shake you and shake you until you get up. All that you hear on TBNN, all that you hear on the television, all that you hear right there on the radio, all that you hear in the message groups is little flowery messages. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That tickle the flesh &gt;&gt; and don't stir the soul. We don't want our flesh tickled. We want our souls to be restored for it restore my soul on tbn. Maya man everything of that woman is demonic. &gt;&gt; Her hair is demonic. &gt;&gt; Her lipstick is demonic. &gt;&gt; Her trousers she wear is demonic. But the people flock there &gt;&gt; and let Edgar Orosco tell you turn tonight. &gt;&gt; If you dance with the devil, [Applause] &gt;&gt; listen, &gt;&gt; if you dance with the devil, &gt;&gt; then you just escorted yourself to hell. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you go with those ministers and dance with them, then you just escorted yourself to hell. That's why this will never die. This is a message from the Lord. This is a man of God here. [Applause] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We dance with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't hear anybody preach on Revelations 10. &gt;&gt; So, you know what I done? &gt;&gt; I shut my ears a long time ago &gt;&gt; with what all the critic says about me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I watch my fruit of my ministry. &gt;&gt; I make my calling and election sure. &gt;&gt; So you close your ears &gt;&gt; to the clinics &gt;&gt; that says you look like a Omar &gt;&gt; with your long dress. We don't listen to clinics anymore. We pass. &gt;&gt; I don't listen to critics anymore. &gt;&gt; I'm like the weather. &gt;&gt; I'm like the weather. Unlike the weather, &gt;&gt; the weather don't take no nonsense &gt;&gt; and notice &gt;&gt; from the critics. &gt;&gt; If it rains &gt;&gt; and the critic says it's too wet, then it rains on. &gt;&gt; It doesn't listen to the critics. If it's hot and you say it's too hot and then the sun starts burning you, it goes on shining. It doesn't listen to clinics &gt;&gt; when it snows &gt;&gt; and it's cold. our ears. And now we got one of the best churches in the message because we close our ears. [Applause] [Music] And today they even lie in the pulpit. &gt;&gt; You hear them saying, \"Can you feel the anointing? &gt;&gt; Then there is no anointing. &gt;&gt; It's a lie. They had thousands and thousands of people &gt;&gt; right up here with that big church. &gt;&gt; They even had to close the road and they were pulling for money all the time. &gt;&gt; And just 20 minutes preaching. &gt;&gt; And after they preached, the pastor came up. Can you feel the anointing? Yeah, you only anointed their pockets to get their money, &gt;&gt; but the anointing of God wasn't there. &gt;&gt; We don't preach money here. We preach the word of Almighty God. [Music] You don't have to say, \"Can you feel the Holy Ghost? Can you feel the anointing?\" &gt;&gt; That's not Bible. &gt;&gt; This is what happens &gt;&gt; when the anointing is there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Close your eyes and say, \"Lord, seal me. Lord, feel me. This is your night. This is the light for you to feel the anointing. [Applause] [Music] Oh, wait. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. [Applause] You can be baptized with the Holy Ghost. You can be sealed away. Hallelujah. You can grab a hold of the altar tonight. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] Forever I visitation of the angel in South Africa. Here he is. Yay. Brother Brandham did not have to come back. The angel has come back. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The angel is here now. Close your eyes and say, \"Lord, seal me. Lord, fill me.\" This is your night. [Music] Amen. So, nobody can tell you, \"Can you feel the Holy Ghost?\" If you don't see this there, then he's lying in the pulpit. He's lying on a holy place. He's lying before God. If you don't see this, there is no Holy Ghost. There is no anointing. This is S. Amen. And and the Bible says in Acts chapter 2 when they came from the upper room they couldn't sit still. They couldn't sit in their chairs like those people couldn't. That's what happened in the day of Pentecost. They got up and went into the street and they were drunk. Amen. Hallelujah. Where is that? [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't you feel like that tonight? Look at it here. Look at it. Look at it. A bunch of drunkies here tonight. You don't have to tell them. Can you feel the anointing is you know that's not Bible Bible is in 2 Chronicles chapter 7 verse two readise [Applause] When the glory comes, the preacher cannot preach. When the anointing comes, you don't have to say it here. It comes. Uh it don't come from a church. It don't come from an organization. It comes from heaven and it calls the church. The fire of God. You don't have to say it. You can feel the fire. You can feel the heat. Can you feel it tonight? There you go. Neahhemiah &gt;&gt; Neahhemiah chapter 8 and nine 8 five and six &gt;&gt; read &gt;&gt; Hold it. &gt;&gt; When he read the word, what did the people do? What does Elan do when the Bible gets read? &gt;&gt; I would rather stand up in respect to the Bible &gt;&gt; than to stand up. with the anthem of South Africa. &gt;&gt; When the word gets read, we stand up in honor. and lead on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why do you say amen? Is because it's in the Bible. &gt;&gt; When they finished read the word and they heard the word and the word of God was preached, the people got up and said, \"Amen.\" Amen. Amen. Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. Thank you. Could we read on? &gt;&gt; No. What? Worth lifting. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Where do you see that? &gt;&gt; I see it in E Tabernacle. I don't see it in TBNN, but I see it in Eel Tabernacle. People get up, shout, \"Amen.\" Amen. Raise up their hands. You are in the Bible. You are in the Bible. You are in the Bible. Full obedience to the word. And they worship God. &gt;&gt; And nobody told them to do it. &gt;&gt; They done it automatically. &gt;&gt; I never told you to do it. Then why are you doing it? &gt;&gt; There's a supernatural being in you. I said, \"Come on, put up your hands. Come on, dance. Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Oh my god. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] USA. [Applause] Heat. Heat. All right. Yes, you don't have to tell the people. It's automatic. A super. When you ask the people to say amen. When you tell the people man can you feel the means that they don't have the supernatural being in them. &gt;&gt; That's why you have to ask them. But if they have the supernatural being in them, [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] [Music] Oh my. Yes. [Music] I know the service is over. I want to push on a little. Brother Paul, if you have to beg the people to say amen and you tell the people say amen. And if there's anyone that don't amen, then he just lost the opportunity to gladden God's heart. When you don't say amen, you don't gladden God's heart. Why he writes says amen, brother Brennham. And said, thus saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord. It gladden God's heart. And you say amen tonight. It gladden God's heart. Oh, hallelujah. The fire is going Heat. Heat. Let me settle. Lord, this is too much. Go on. Glad is glad in his heart. Glad his art. Go on. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't have to ask them. It's automatic. Just something inside said clap your hands man. Just inside in you say dance man. Inside of you said cladding my heart with a amen. [Applause] Oh god. &gt;&gt; Oh my Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; brother Daniel, we don't care what the critics say &gt;&gt; because me, &gt;&gt; I don't cry over spilled milk. [Applause] I don't care about split milk. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for another cow. &gt;&gt; No spo [Applause] milk. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my [Music] Peter &gt;&gt; Peter on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Peter on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 never told them &gt;&gt; to be drunk. &gt;&gt; They automatically were drunk. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Peter on the day of Pentecost &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. never told them to speak in another tongue. &gt;&gt; Their tongues just flip over &gt;&gt; and they spoke in another tongue. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; They spoke in another tongue. Peter never on the day of Pentecost said, \"Make a noise.\" &gt;&gt; He just said it was noise abroad. &gt;&gt; I never told you make a noise. But wherever Jesus is, there's a noise. Is there a noise here? And Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is here. I'm still &gt;&gt; just busy &gt;&gt; with my introduction. [Applause] [Music] Now [Applause] &gt;&gt; the introduction to what? &gt;&gt; To the greatest &gt;&gt; message. that was ever preach introduction. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's called that day on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Can you read? &gt;&gt; Hold it. &gt;&gt; What? The world won't see me no more. &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin won't see the oil no more. The message group don't see me no more. &gt;&gt; I'm not there. [Music] &gt;&gt; Read on. &gt;&gt; Now that scripture &gt;&gt; is in &gt;&gt; supernatural being in you. [Music] That's why you can't keep quiet. &gt;&gt; Read on. power in the church. Not only was the hands of the church and brought the Lord [Applause] us. &gt;&gt; What is Eel tabernacle? &gt;&gt; Giving out eternal life. That's the greater works. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's why it is the greatest &gt;&gt; message because we to do with &gt;&gt; the greater works. What's the greater works? &gt;&gt; I don't hear you. &gt;&gt; We're giving out eternal life. And if there's anybody here that's not saved, we have it in our hands to give you eternal life because it is the greatest message that was ever preached. I feel like fainting yet tonight. You mean in El Tabernacle? Yes. The Holy Ghost is in your hand. Do you know who you are? Oh, Hey, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost was coming. It is here. and given &gt;&gt; into the hands &gt;&gt; of the church. &gt;&gt; Which church? &gt;&gt; Which church has this? [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Come on out of America.

when I raised up I know this is relied on the floor and looking around to see where it come from it was coming from above the pillar of Fire was hanging just above I was throwing the light on the floor I heard someone walking I look coming through the room coming into this light came a man and human figure he'd be about 200 pounds of weight he had dark hair to his shoulder and Olive complexion is barefooted of course I was frightened and he said to me fear not and as soon as I heard that voice I knew it was the same voice that it always spoke to me but the first time I'd ever seen him in human form [Music] we see Israel in her Homeland the inside the six star born tsar of David flying the oldest inside in the world the oldest flag in the world she's a nation she's a government she's her own people she's in the League of Nations she's she's asked all these things she's in the U.N and she's got her own currency Everything Jesus said this generation shall not cease until everything be fulfilled and remember the very night that Israel was made a nation as a night the age of the Lord appeared to be right now that's right there we all are everything is poured up exactly the truth I have not lied to you Israel returning to their Homeland Israel let me just say this now what I guess it's all for tape let me say this the very hour that Israel become a nation the reason I've always believed for my pleasure that there was something that I'd have apart before I die are getting Israel back to the Lord because the very hour by the Pan American chart that Israel was declared a nation for the first time for 2 000 years since they've been scattered not a people it was that very same hour exactly to the hour that the angel Lord met me up in her and sent me to the with the gospel amen

again to be here in London I came down years and years to Cape Town and I never dreamed that one day I'll be coming to langa and Jonathan told me that it's steadily growing a minimum of people about 16 that's without hermanus I am I'm pleased to God as I said week before last walls dedication I said I nail down a peg when everything seems to go wrong and all the lies that has been told and if made people believe those lies I hit down the pig and I look at that pig Wherever I Go that Prophet visits South Africa page 80. when I stood in front of brother barana [Applause] and he laid hands on me [Applause] now now there's no other minister in South Africa that can say that it's only me [Applause] and then I hit down another Pig as I told the ministers up in joburg it's when bully Paul wrote me a letter and told me brother Roscoe I don't listen to anybody just my father and you I hit down that page [Applause] then I hit down another page with brother higginson the head deacon or brother or Branham Tabernacle came and visit us with brother Brown and after the service I could speak to him but during the service he told the people he says the last time I felt the presence of God like this is when brother Branham preached on this day the scripture is fulfilled that was a loss I felt it until now [Applause] now who's going to stop me who's going to stop me Nigeria Ghana Zambia Cape Town can't stop me I'm ordained from a prophet [Applause] and all the positives all of them can't say what I'm saying now [Applause] so so I didn't come down here Taking Chances I don't take chances because I know who I am I come down to Cape Town many years and I and the people in London came in because of the tapes and that made me come down here I come down here just to pull out some seeds because Billy Paul told me he said brother Roscoe I deserved you and you got one of the best spirits of all the ministers he said to me he said to me he he gave me a gift after I told my dad don't go to Cape Town if the angel of God told you not to go to Cape Town then don't go and he said that please the angel to wake me up to see the angel so I do not know why the angel didn't want to come down to Cape Town I think it's because they rejected the Holy Ghost and bless him did so I'm just looking for someone that will go with me [Applause] to my father's house [Applause] so we are here not by chance we are here to come encourage the ones that's walking with us in Cape Town they will never have what you have never [Applause] on the oldest guy in the message now brother Beckett and them all came afterwards when brother Becca left joburg he didn't even preach he was not even a preacher I learned the preaching I was here teaching him so how can he teach me how can I learn from somebody that don't know as much as I know he doesn't know what I know and I'm getting old and I don't like nonsense anymore I don't play church or churchy and I do not play with people's Souls so I bring greetings to El Tabernacle Johannesburg Victoria storm he bloomfontein the people that has called in from the USA Brazil Swaziland leidenberg mobile planning Cecil bug [Music] polokwane and uh and all my Pentecostal friends it's on the streaming may you be blessed two Pentecostal Brothers two weeks ago pastors walked up to me I said brother Roscoe we're following you on a stream although we painted coastals but we silent Believers in here I greet you my brothers your Baptist is listening to me I greet you I look forward to one day share the Holy Ghost with you [Applause] and over in Vendor may God bless you as you streaming tonight and I hope that the streaming will just make you walk closer to God that's all that it's all about as I said the storehouse we'll try to put the details on for years that don't have the details to sign on we'll put it on after the service and tomorrow morning and uh we hope that all those tapes I preached over 3 000 tapes so this will never run dry [Applause] now bully Paul and Joseph Brennan can tell all the ministers to switch on and press and listen to the tape but they can't tell me that brother Graham says this boy will preach exactly what I preach [Applause] brother Branham says I must preach [Applause] and I can't listen to them I must listen to brother Brennan [Applause] so may you be blessed and the few families in the USA that's listening in may God just come your way to another as you listen to it this broadcast so let us preach I hope you're going to have patience with me tonight I must see how far we get I do not know I got comments to make before I preach and if you've got a pen and PayPal write down what I'm going to say go back home we're going to check it up don't go to your pastor because he's gonna lie to you go look it and they came unto the brook of s call Brokers where the water flows and cut down from cinch a bunch with one cluster of grapes they bit off a branch just with one cluster of grapes that was not the whole branch that was part of the branch that they broke off and the Bible says and they bear it between two upon a staff two guys had to carry that bunch of grapes it was so heavy one couldn't two had to carry The Grapes of the Promised Land God doesn't change and they brought off the pomegranates amen and of the figs three types of fruit in the Promised Land have your church got this fruit in their church have you got these fruit in your church I'd like to take another scripture I'd ask you to be patient with me right Galatians 5. now that's the fruit of the land and the land is the Holy Ghost now if your pastor preached on the Holy Ghost and that fruit is not in his ministry then he's lying to you then he is a Baptist trying to pull wool over your face if he hasn't got grapes in his ministry then he's not called Galatians 5. and verse 22 but the Fruit of the Spirit let me say but the fruit of the land because the land is a spirit so the two scriptures goes together am I right is love joy now they say love love love love but love is only a fruit of the spirit the spirit don't come out of love love comes out of the spirit so get the spirit first because you say brotherly kindness brother don't come and tell Edgar Osco that because Edgar Osco want to see the holy ghost first then the fruit of the spirit love [Applause] otherwise he is not loved that man and out of love joy they love love love love love love but there isn't no joy in the church the pastor never danced around the pulpit yet but he speak about love and he's got no joy brother we have joy we have love and we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] amen did you catch that I'd like to take Romans I didn't I didn't give this to you Edgar I just thought I'm gonna throw it in the air and read the scripture Romans 8. verse 23 first Romans 8 23. and not only then but ourselves also which what now what is the first fruit of the spirit love the Bible don't contradict itself then why is the pastors contradict themselves why does Bible Tabernacle lie like that let's take another one eight same Romans 8 I think verse 9. focus on this is already too much but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit it's so be that the spirit of God dwells in you not if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his you don't even belong to Jesus even if you in Bible Tabernacle if you don't have the spirit you're none of his he's going to say turn around I know you not and they never had the Holy Ghost in Bible Tabernacle they never had an outpouring in Bible Tabernacle they never had a dance in Bible Tabernacle [Applause] that pasta never danced Hallelujah can you imagine brother Becca dance [Applause] but I saw brother Brennan dance [Applause] [Music] that's why longer stay where you are stay where you are [Applause] [Music] I think and the only one that can correct back it but he can't correct me amen I can show you where he's wrong let me tell you this just this before you said we went Florida and Bob Browns Church and brother Beckett only preached porber holiday like he now recently just preached van diyao and sing with dry Baptist Methodist songs that's why please give me a monster [Applause] and it was so dead in that church after Beckett preached brother Becca preached we went to the hotel and brother Becker threw himself on the bed he says you know brother Roscoe my church is dead but this church is deader I said Angel just write down what he says now [Applause] this word catch him just after he died just after he died that will come to him out of his own mouth his church is dead I went same thing happened church is dead he went on the Sunday morning was was he fell asleep I went in the evening and I made them laugh I made them I made them loose [Applause] and when Bob Brown's church was loose you know you sat right in front here every time you finish preaching don't close the meeting you don't say nothing what you preach you just turn around to the people and say you dismiss that was Beckett's right-hand guy that that was brother Beckett's Colonel of a guy I said I look at brother back and I said no what is this people with hats on but Beckett will go after that nonsense and thus is recorded in heaven and when I was finished and they were laughing and they were free I put in the Holy Ghost there [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] so can brother Becca tell me anything out of his own multi-cities church is dead nobody can tell me anything I was here before they were again okay that's enough of that if I should entitle this a message tonight or to tell entitle it the fruit of the land the fruit of the land I have never heard anybody preach on the fruit of the land the pomegranates the honey the figs and the grapes all speaks about the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] he told Israel when you get in the land that's what you're going to get amen let's buy our heads father I've traveled a thousand miles or kilometers down here not to waste any time but to be glad to be able to work for you and not doing you a service but do everything that I do to show back into the Bible [Applause] may you a father look at the heart and please give us something to think about I ask it in Jesus name amen you may be seated [Applause] now as I said I've never heard anybody preach on the fruit of the land because the land's got fruit and he told them it's got fruit and we want to check that fruit up but before going in there I just got something to say before I start preaching I'd like to take Point number one and now let's see how many has discernment discernment is to be able to discern between two things right and wrong virgin or foolish virgin God or not God see if you got discernment quote but manifested quote it's good to quote but he said quote manifested in your church so I want to see as this gets streamed out who's got discernment where is the discernment it's to match up two things the right thing and the wrong thing so just for a couple of minutes let's see if Cape Town has discernment are they taking what their pastor says or what brother Branham says are they taking just a quote and not a manifested quote amen if you have your paint pins and papers to it right around the world I would like you to write down these quotes the first one is the middle is festered manifestation of thy Resurrection to the people of this day listen to that brother Brahm says there I can hear a noise a noise do you hear a noise in the churches in the message in Cape Town but brother Brown says I hear a noise I can imagine the poor blind beggar said it's this noise all about why does el Tabernacle make a noise what is this noise all about [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now listen you know he tells us you know well I'm in Bible temp I'm in that Temple I'm in that type of and and I'm in you know but he tells you do you know that say that you're in the message you know usually where Jesus is there was always a little noise [Applause] foreign [Applause] it upsets the Baptist because brother Beckett comes from the Baptist um it always upsets the Baptist if there's a noise and I heard they said the last time I was here you can't you can't shout all the time who tell you you can't why do the cherubims shout day and night all the time [Applause] get behind me Satan [Applause] it's a little upsetting they get upset the Baptist in the message they get upset and you know for 57 years that I'm in the message they got upset but you think they could change me I had a pet down I had a peck done [Applause] couldn't stop me can't stop me will never stop me I will dance like David does [Applause] [Music] amen then he says why why a lot life comes in life what what brings a noise and you say you got life and there's no noise you're a liar because brother Branham says life brings a noise [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] churches get out of that synagogues of Satan get out where there's a noise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I believe the prophet and not Bible Tabernacle no I told you to have discernment could Bible Tabernacle take this quote [Music] then when you miss one word you're going to hell one word with all the Nigerians and whatever it is in your church you're going to hell miss this quote now when I like to say this I said discernment between the right and wrong now if you take the opposite of this good he says where there's a noise there's Jesus Jesus is there where there's a noise now the opposite if there is no noise is Jesus there [Applause] [Music] do you believe the prophet do you believe this quote then why don't they do it [Applause] I wonder can you do me a favor you turn around to one another and tell one another wherever Jesus is there's a noise [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] my God [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you see I got a very little blacks from up ethical way Congo Zambia all very few I all got local blacks here because I got local black blood in there thank you shame on you you can't even give God the glory you sit there like a pope get out man get out [Applause] let us just say this did I just say this when light comes in life brings a noise now tell me is Jesus life is that what he says in Saint John 14 does he say that I am the [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay that was a quote in 1954. in case you want to know where it is it's your write you down so when a devil come to you I tell you don't make such a lot of noise you show him this quote [Applause] do you want another one let's take number two simonian Church 1960 1206 money in church look what he says I like a good now this is what your Prophet likes is not what Bible believers Baptist Prof uh Pastor like this is what the prophet William Branham likes he likes this he says I like a good what just hold it there the power of God Must Fall it mustn't be that the pastor goes up and he says let's worship God and then our theme and when he gets tired the whole church is tired it dies down no it falls and automatically there's a shouting there's a jumping that amen [Applause] [Music] [Music] through spruce man Bruce for tell me oh yeah but the prophet fellow do you like what the prophet likes [Applause] then you won't like Bible Believers you won't like that church if you like what the prophet likes and he likes when the Holy Ghost Falls not when he comes let's worship and when he gets tired everybody gets tired and assume there's no Holy Ghost that's not the Holy Ghost that's a Strange Fire amen we need fire all right [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he says where the power of God is falling what does he say further can you read it for me holy I thought you must be quiet like brother Beckett you must be quiet no no no no no no no no no not evgar Roscoe I'll scream I'll shout I'll praise God I'll dance Hallelujah why the prophet light say it [Music] and you like it and you like it and you like it [Applause] [Music] some guys were sent to Elijah and Elijah says you'll go back go tell ayab Elijah is here you go back you can tell Beckett the good old schools here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it says you are screaming shouting praising God doing what langa are you having a good time foreign [Music] you preachers and now watch what he says but you but we you can't hear amen hardly anymore it's our man and back at you well Abraham says that's nonsense it's her amen it's a amen what's some feeling in it that's what he says [Music] can you give the devil a nice amen can't hear you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's where this end time Church is this is only my commands I'm not preaching the message yet I'm too full [Applause] foreign number three the bridge between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals well you know 1963. write down write down could you imagine Peter and James and John and then in the upper room saying oh we got the Holy Ghost like they say in Bible Tabernacle we've got the Holy Ghost we've got the Holy Ghost now but maybe we better keep stall a quiet Holy Ghost brother said maybe they they said we've got to have a a holy ghost without emotions there is no quote like that anyhow but Beckett and they made it a quote with valyria teeth but there is no quote like receiving the Holy Ghost without emotions I blasted that thing they don't even use it anymore and yeah brother Branham comes back he says you've got the Holy Ghost and you see we must keep still you don't have to be so excited you're making too much noise if you get a holy ghost my friend you're going to make a noise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we should keep stall listen to brother Branham brother says brother in other words Hey Brother in Bible table Miracle brother wake up you're in the wrong place you're keeping stole while the chatterbombs is crying holy holy holy holy and you keeping stop [Applause] and this is in the seals what did they do through Windows imagine they climbed through Windows after receiving the Holy Ghost so emotional they were they went through the windows they went through the doors and everything they needed to go out and make a noise [Applause] they went out into the street [Applause] you think brother Beckett can do that he can't even do it in his church because he don't have the Holy Ghost I will stand at the day of judgment and judge him for rejecting the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I will be his judge [Music] play with fire play with your mother than to play with Edgar Oscar [Applause] they went through everything out into the streets doing what I don't hear you did you read it thank you I don't hear you that's that's viable Tabernacle act like a bunch of drunks then what are you doing there he says that's what the Holy Ghost does so if you don't act like a drunk man amen walking up and down and blubbering hey man he published you can't even hear him and his brother is hallelujah [Music] speaking in tongues a drunk man [Music] [Applause] just read that for me again acting can they still be in the message can Bible but Tabernacle still be in the message how many quotes did I give you that they can't perform struggling for 53 years since I'm in the message 57 years in fact and they will never get it if your pastor don't have it the church won't have it if the pastor can't be drunk how can the church be drunk if the pastor don't have it he can't give it but come to a pasta come to El Tabernacle come here where we have the dynamic Center mechanics [Music] [Applause] this is thus saith the Lord [Applause] because it's the quotes [Applause] how does he end this how does he end this quote can you end this quote for me [Applause] I don't hear you [Applause] so that's the real Holy Ghost not the quiet back at Holy Ghost that's Holy Ghost with a shouting and a jumping and a good time in the Lord and a joy unspeakable and full of glory and a half has never yet been told Amen brother a dancing Holy Ghost amen that's the real Holy Ghost thus saying the prophet not thus Saiyan brother Beckett thus saith William Branham [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jesus don't know it but I know the prophet but brother when he says you can know the prophet you can pay your tithes you can come to church you can quote call Will quote brother Branham he said but still you need the token if you don't have the token you'll die if you die because you're none of his [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] church church here in London just finish this quote again for me now there's only one baptism not true not Bible Tabernacle and El Tabernacle one of the two must be wrong who's wrong I don't hear you I don't hear you and who's right Tabernacle propose the quotation [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign that's that's the appeal that's a Real McCoy man how do you say in xhosa for real ESO so Indiana [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you want more that's not my message it's my comments but it's more powerful than brother Beckett could ever preach when we're in a platform back again to sit at the back of me because I'm The Real McCoy because I bring the real genuine Holy Ghost the one that President speaks about foreign [Applause] I'm an apostle I need to straighten out those false Brothers amen that's what I'm hearing langa for I'm straightening out somebody [Applause] with that quiet Holy Ghost [Applause] amen sister with a scarf on Amen you feel the ripple from the holy of holies [Applause] let's take the next one uncertain sounds this is my one you can take this quote to any church and you'll find out they're not fulfilling it they don't have it they can't do this because they're not the real Church that's why I like this one uncertain sounds page 53 I think it is just read me that first sentence just as far as that brother France for springster theater reference amen you Nigerians better wake up you say you believe the prophets what can you take this quote [Applause] I don't care about brother Beckett I'm gonna tell you why the quote says can you read it further sorry just stop there human Mary of the Catholic Church what's drunk my brother bakeries are not drunk he is he's never been drunk he doesn't know how the wine tastes he was not in the promised land he never carried the grapes amen the real fightful Ministry carried the grapes why should God let the real preachers come with grapes you make wine from grapes so the land is

brother Branham say you need to be drunk were you ever drunken Bible Tabernacle you say anybody ever drunk not with the Teaching Ministry but otherwise her teaching Minister he can't give you the Holy Ghost and check all her teachers they never got the Holy Ghost and they never gave out the Holy Ghost because brother Branham said so Becca is a dry preacher maybe he saved me just to tell you could this be the reason why the angel didn't want to brought brother Abraham to come to Cape Town they rejected the grapes the bishop rejected the grapes and the angel said Prophet you don't go there oh why Why did Why did why why didn't he want him to come here but he says get to Johannesburg there's a little boy there I want you to lay hands on him because he's my Apostle he's going to make this

brother Oscar you see you're a black guy your temperament and we white temperaments is two different things if you dance shout and all that which we don't condemn you it's your temperament but we want to be quiet check all the white churches they quiet I got off from I said this is your liar he says what do you mean I says when Elvis Presley cleaning and he made like this [Music] I said your woman got so mad amen they put their underneath clothing and threw it on they were shouting and jumping I said in a soccer matches sir Amen in England amen when when they score a goal those guys jump up but you'll come to the message we whites shame on you [Applause] same on you you lying [Applause] laughs [Applause] no I highlighted this I want you to read that highlight now that's the way that the church is ordained that's the way the church started Now read on his Bible his Bible Believers that kind of a church do they Shout do they scream with a life behind it they justify Sanctified but they never enter the Promised Land they got the Ten Commandments the 10 seals and all that but without the promised land they died in the wilderness and all in in Becca's church is gonna die because they that don't have desperate that brother pranam says is none of his not some good at temperament and others got that temperament don't work that way you want another one oh my my time is gone the Easter seal I believe that Pentacles began without an ending [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh the Indian s Bible Believers Tabernacle it ended there because he said a couple of years ago about 30 years ago he said he'd rather be a baptism a Pentecostal but here brother Brahm says it started without an end it's going on in langa right now [Applause] [Music] I believe it's to be to every creature all times all times all times now tomorrow Damon 100 years at 200 years 2000 years amen 3.5 billion years it's all the time Pentecost [Music] [Applause] all the time at all places the boats will be all over Ali Becca do you know why Ali placa do you know why Aldi placa but all in US is [Applause] [Music] all places that Pentecost should always remain yes they're in trouble Bible Believers is in trouble brother Beckett is in trouble [Music] [Applause] should always remain the Pentecostal blessing should be upon the people keep it upon the people keep Pentecost all the people amen don't ever take it away don't quench the Holy Ghost don't throw water on the Holy Ghost don't quiet the people down if they live the life then they're going to shout for victory [Applause] oh my I don't know what to do said the last one day okay let's go it's only my commands the sign of unbelief when God gave Solomon a great gift of discernment and all Israel rallied around it oh wouldn't it be a great day today if all the churches would rally around God's great gift the Holy Spirit would you not be wonderful if we just forget our differences and denominations and just realize rally around the greatest gift that God gave ever sent to the Earth the Holy Spirit his son died that he might come could you read the other one the holy spirit is greater and the Bible and Hugo on the prophet says the prophet said the prophet said the prophet says the Holy Ghost is greater than what the prophet said because the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible [Applause] it says you speak one word against he says you can speak against the word it will be forgiven him but speak against the Holy Ghost it will never be forgiven here [Music] by Christ came the spirit when they called him Balsam up he said you say that against me the son of man they quote the scripture I'll forgive you but when the Holy Ghost has come and does the same thing one word against it will never be forgotten forgiven in this world not the word to come and George Martin calls falling in the spirit they fall like monkeys when they dance they dance like Michael Jackson one word I don't care what you're saying the invoice it's goodbye No Redemption and how many words did that two guys speak against the Holy Ghost the minute they die they have to face this for what they said against the Holy Ghost it's one word against it will never be forgiven in this world not the world to come and this is a greater day than that was just a day now when God has poured out his spirit from Johannesburg right down to Cape Town right overseas it's a greater gift amen giving out the Holy Ghost over 40 countries people is under the spirit it's a greater day this day when he poured out his Spirit according to Joel 2 and I'll pour out my spirit at All Flesh it's a greater day than when brother pranam was here amen because the Holy Ghost has gone right around the world Amen and baptizing people amen the way brother Branham says the Holy Ghost is jumping and shouting and emotions thank you the Holy Spirit working universally in his church universally 40 countries it never happened with anybody that's stupid right here took it around over 40 countries I think I'm gonna close give it another one there's another one yep the Seal of God that's the way God does when he he sends his power down with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he moved in right there and Away went the message Hallelujah and they shouted and screamed you mean when the message went down they shouted and screamed and spoke in tongues and went out there and that was the mark that God put upon the people that was the mark shouting and screaming that was the mark that God put on the people did he put it on you [Applause] then why are you so quiet [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] could you read the next line for me is that right when when you've been here in langa you mean right now that kind of a mark [Applause] do you understand why the shouting and the jumping is here and the speaking in tongues and loving the word not quoting the word and not be years of the word but doers of the word that's really the other lines the same seal what was the Seal of God shouting jumping screaming is that the seal if that angel come down here and he's here you're shopping and jumping and he seals in amen because that's the type of a seal there is no Baptist Bible Tabernacle sale two different seals there's only one seal and this will produce jumping and shouting and being drunk in the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] you can clap your hands it's all right [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] what type of seal is this Lord I do not know why you gave that girl the greatest thing in the Bible to complete the baptism of the Holy Ghost they try to tell me the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost without emotions I couldn't take it until one day I got the quote and I quiet the whole world [Applause] and I still they don't say it anymore why because don't tell them Edgar Osco is here [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

they only have an experience because of the word by quotes but it come by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that sanctions you nothing else and I don't care who you are [Applause] [Music] I am the apostle why because my fruits tell me I am so when you see God you see me and when you see me you see God and Devil let me tell you when the 70th Jubilee come you're gonna see another God Amen called The

I was sitting in the car and I watched all the sisters was trickling into this place and it's been such a beautiful scene for Hey, [applause] [applause] they they look like angels. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; moving to a specific place and I said to myself, it had come it was not in vain. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; My loving is not in vain. &gt;&gt; I I thought as the marched in here. I thought when the devil look over the benister of his domain and they look at them, I wonder what does he think? I'm sure He must be jealous, you know. [applause] Because this is just a different bunch. Not the same people. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; So um tonight this question and answer is not so much preaching. Sometimes wonder why we have things like this but they sang the song. Yeah. Jesus is the answer. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; And we are the question. We got so many questions. So I'm so glad that he is the answer. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Because before there could be a question, &gt;&gt; there had to be an answer. [applause] So, the university students threw up some questions that we're going to answer tonight because we believe that he is the king of El Tabernacle. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; and he wants to answer you. So let us just bow our eyes and look towards him. Our heavenly father, I think it's Paul that says he's the greatest, the chiefest sinner of them all. We come to you if we failed you during the course of this day. May you forgive us what we thought and whatever we done that don't satisfy you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; in thought, word, and deed. Forgive us. We are here tonight because there's questions. Lord, for every question [applause] there's an answer because Jesus is the answer. [applause] I do pray that you would bless your children here, the ones you washed in your blood. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; that we could come out on a Thursday night and have church. So we love church Lord. May you further undertake for us [applause] in Jesus name. You may be seated now. We sorry for the brethren that stands around the hallway. Yeah. We didn't think it's going to be packed like this. Um we were just coming to the university students and um but um it is not what it is. So please just let your hair down and don't look at me as if I come from I do come from space. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; But I'm with you for a long time now. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um, just do me a favor. Turn around and just tell the one next to you, just cool it, my brother. Everything is fine. Did you do it with a feeling? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; casual that I had grow down and um just have a little bit of a difference than sitting in El Tabernacle. I just want the deacons also to sit tonight. Leave the people alone tonight. If they want to laugh, if they want to, you know, we just have one wonderful time together tonight. [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about Logan. I'll call him up afterwards to loosen you up a little bit. Amen. So, um we um we're in the world one time and then during the week we used to go to Bic. We came home 12:00 the night and uh we went to work the next day. &gt;&gt; Now, why can't we come out tonight at 12:00? [cheering] [applause] [applause] Well, I see the UEFA matches on And it start late, you know, 10:00, you get done there at 12:00. Some happy, some sad, &gt;&gt; but we are here tonight.

I don't know about the other guys. You know, okay, questions and answers. Wherever you go, there's a question. Now, why this? Why must this be so? Why why must the tax be so high? Why must I struggle so financially? Why don't I have money? Why can't I get an auntie? Question, question, question. And that's a part of our life. Since you know yourself, you have questions. And one thing I notice about God, God likes to question. I always wonder why does brother Brennham like to have meetings, question and answer meetings until I dissected the word and I found out that God is the one that always ask questions. He asked the question and when I look down here I can't see this. God like to ask questions. He asked a question in Genesis 3:9. And he says, \"And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, where art thou?\" Question. I know where I left you, Adam. I left you being behind holiness. But where are you now? And I wonder if God isn't asking that question a lot in our time. My son, where are you? You find people that has been with El Tabernacle, but you can't help to ask the question, where are you now? Question. Genesis 3:13. And the Lord God said unto the woman, \"What is this that thou has done?\" Question.

[applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a time we had last night. [applause and cheering] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; I want to thank brother Stefford and Abigail, my daughter, &gt;&gt; for raring men of God. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And now they could plant back into the church. [applause] &gt;&gt; All the years of turmoil and struggle, &gt;&gt; sweat, &gt;&gt; and tears &gt;&gt; and labor. &gt;&gt; It's worth sitting &gt;&gt; under something like that. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; We surely we surely &gt;&gt; proud of you young guys. [applause] &gt;&gt; God sent you in here to push the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; I would also start where my grandson started. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Same quotation. [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; We don't have it on that one. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. I want the world to see it. Can we read it? &gt;&gt; Can we read it? &gt;&gt; And so &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I hope that his voice auth Even I [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] love you. [applause] [cheering] There there has never been anything like that in the Bible. &gt;&gt; There's never been anything like that &gt;&gt; in the end time message. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; So, it's so good &gt;&gt; to be able to &gt;&gt; not only quote Bible &gt;&gt; but to manifest &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; We could even say brother Burnham didn't have the opportunity And uh this weekend you didn't only come to a service, &gt;&gt; you come to this day. &gt;&gt; The scripture [cheering and applause] is to [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; But what's happening now is far more greater than this quote. [applause] &gt;&gt; Why? [applause] Why? Because Jesus says a son &gt;&gt; and a grandson and a grandfather, &gt;&gt; but I got two sons and I've got two grandsons. So it's bigger than this. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; I have already preached with my sons and grandsons. But I just felt in my spirit, &gt;&gt; I like to preach with my grandsons. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; And it's far more greater than President Mandela. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; There's something more greater than President Mandela [cheering] because he's got no sons that can follow him. I have and not a kingdom of South Africa, the kingdom of heaven. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; So we come to manifest &gt;&gt; that scripture. &gt;&gt; Such a lot of scriptures has been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Makes sense to the word is fulfilled. The token bearer &gt;&gt; is fulfilled. [cheering] &gt;&gt; One that has the dynamics. It's &gt;&gt; fulfilled. Another Ephesians is here fulfilled. [cheering] Turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal faith. It's from F. [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Somebody will come one day &gt;&gt; and blaz evolution [cheering] fulfall [applause and cheering] will come. It's fulfilled. [cheering and applause] [applause] [cheering] A little boy will come and preach exactly like the prophet. Same message. [cheering] It's fulfilled. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:8. It's fulfilled. [cheering] Revelations 10:37 thunders uttered their voices [cheering] fulfilled. Matthew 25 fulfilled [cheering] [applause] the gospel trumpet fulfilled. [cheering] You sit in a church that fulfills scriptures. [cheering] [cheering] Heat. [applause] [cheering] Heat. [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; we together again &gt;&gt; and when we together &gt;&gt; then hell shakes. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; We give out eternal life &gt;&gt; to men &gt;&gt; that got nearly 200 years in prison. &gt;&gt; We gave them eternal life. The year turn [cheering] &gt;&gt; fulfilled. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham [applause] got one prisoner off the hook &gt;&gt; and they gave him a medallion or something for it. El Tabernacle. We can't even count that. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] [applause] And &gt;&gt; just before going into the sermon, &gt;&gt; we have at last &gt;&gt; broke the backl of the Durban church. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; So yet again, [applause] there's another church that's gone up. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; We were just speaking of the guys that gave towards this church, Brother Eddie Muhammad and them. &gt;&gt; And yet here it stands. And the blessings, Brother Eddie, is not going to end. &gt;&gt; Look at it now. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; So I greet you &gt;&gt; my friends. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Good evening friends. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] [cheering and applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I'm happy to be with you again. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Last night when Joe finished preach and nearly simultaneously me and Jonathan told him, \"Um, him and his brother Joel, man, if we get a little more older, &gt;&gt; don't put us out of your church, okay?\" Amen. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; So don't put me out of this church. [applause] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't go. &gt;&gt; You can't get rid of me. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; So I greet all of you. I wish we could have been under one roof. I see where it's full next door. And the tent is also full. &gt;&gt; And uh but uh as long as you a couple of feet from the anointing, &gt;&gt; you will still feel &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Now tonight we have a mixed crowd and I have to cater for a mixed crowd. I have to also preach ABCs around &gt;&gt; the band here &gt;&gt; and uh um to reach everybody and um therefore I'd like to go to what I'm busy with &gt;&gt; Matthew 25 If your Bibles with you, [applause] &gt;&gt; we turn to Matthew 25. &gt;&gt; Just one verse. Matthew 25 verse two. [crying] And five of them were wise and five were foolish. Half of the church &gt;&gt; was foolish. And I'm not going to speak about the wise. &gt;&gt; I want to speak on the foolish church. &gt;&gt; The foolish church. It's quite strange that God &gt;&gt; will put two churches &gt;&gt; right in the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; right at the time &gt;&gt; when Messiah comes. &gt;&gt; Right at that time &gt;&gt; where Trump put up taxes to tax the people. &gt;&gt; As Herod tax the people, &gt;&gt; they had to go to Bethlehem where Jesus had to be born because of taxes. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; The first coming taxes &gt;&gt; and now &gt;&gt; taxes again. at the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So there'll be two churches right &gt;&gt; today. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; There'll be a wise church &gt;&gt; and there'll be a foolish church. &gt;&gt; And you have to think &gt;&gt; in which church you are in &gt;&gt; tonight. [applause and cheering] The El Tabernacle is a foolish church. And I want to tell you, you better get out &gt;&gt; and go look where there is &gt;&gt; a wise church &gt;&gt; where the scriptures are being fulfilled. [applause] And if you're from any other church, may you sit here in this meeting tonight and may you do some calculations in your mind &gt;&gt; and ask yourself the question, &gt;&gt; do I belong to a foolish church &gt;&gt; or do I belong to &gt;&gt; a wise church? [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; We want to find that out tonight. [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, so ironic, &gt;&gt; nobody actually spoke on this, &gt;&gt; but the king himself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No disciples spoke on this. &gt;&gt; No scribe, &gt;&gt; no Pharisee, &gt;&gt; but the Lord himself. [applause] [cheering] [applause] And he tells us &gt;&gt; in that time, &gt;&gt; open your eyes, &gt;&gt; there's going to be two churches, [applause] &gt;&gt; one foolish church, and one wise church. &gt;&gt; And you will have to fight through it all. It's not easy to get into the wise church. [cheering] &gt;&gt; It is a battle. It is a revelation. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And the king says in Matthew 25, &gt;&gt; he said, \"Just before I come, &gt;&gt; and I hope if you're in El Tabernacle &gt;&gt; that you're not foolish. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now why is she foolish? &gt;&gt; Why is this church foolish? Webster dictionary says a fool is somebody &gt;&gt; lacking understanding &gt;&gt; can't understand &gt;&gt; why this people &gt;&gt; going like a bunch of mad [cheering] heresy worshippers can't understand. [cheering] [cheering] A fool is somebody &gt;&gt; that lacks judgment &gt;&gt; or choosing. &gt;&gt; They can't judge properly. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; That's a fool. or she can't even see common sense, &gt;&gt; apples and pears. &gt;&gt; She can't discern common sense. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; or one that's fooled. &gt;&gt; One that's fooled get deceived with the wrong ignorant &gt;&gt; things of the world. &gt;&gt; Is it to influence them? by family &gt;&gt; or friends &gt;&gt; or popular opinion. [applause] &gt;&gt; I rather go with a stream. &gt;&gt; I rather go with a majority of the people &gt;&gt; than to accept the right thing. [cheering] &gt;&gt; That's a fool.\n"}, {"id": "2023-02-13 - Meet Joe... A Short Story by EL Tabernacle Storehouse - Meet Joe...

We greet you all in the name of Jesus [Applause] Christ. We are here to unveil a stone and it's not any stone. We are here to identify that El Tabernacle has moved across southern Africa. We are here yet to identify that the man has come around. [Applause] We are here to identify that God is in somebody because how can these things be and how can we wor witness so many miracles in El Tabernacle like we are ministering and seeing every day. So once again, we are witnesses to Pastor Ja down here in the Eastern Cape as he follows the star. [Applause] And I'd like to tell the believers and our pastor Ja, don't follow us, follow the dove. [Applause] because the dove knows the way home. So let us pray. Lord, we come to you as your apostle vision for El Tabernacle is continuing. We are yet to unveil El Tabernacle stone, a stone that is of great essence for the hour we're living in. May you come and bless us as we prepare for the service. Lord, may you come and bless each one of these here has come to witness this day. We give you all the praise, all the glory in Jesus name. Amen and amen. [Applause] Are you happy? Don't look at Paul says, \"Wherefore, because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works of the law, for they stumbled at the stumbling stone. As it is written, Behold, I lay in Z a stumbling stone, a rock which going to be an offense to everybody. And whosoever believeth on him to stone his person. So even there are people that still are confused about him because he's a rock of offense. He's a stumbling stone. You must stumble when he is there. You have big question mark cuz it's he is a stumbling stone. Hallelujah. But he says I'll put that stumbling stone in El Tabernacle. Whoever believe on him will will [Music] be saved. [Music] [Applause] So that's why we are here. So we are here to identify him because it's his stone, his ministry here in the eastern. So pastor Ja follow that stumbling stone and you will be saved with everybody that comes here. Nobody will like the stone. Everybody hates it cuz it's offensive. It tramps on your toes. Tells you you're not right. You can put any tape on, you will hear. It's a rock of offense. But it's God's stone. And in closing, the stone that the builders has rejected is the rejected one. The one that's rejected in the message is become the head of Elwood, El Tabernacle Church. Amen. So, Pastor Ja, you and your wife, can you just open it up for us? Praise the Lord. We are we got lot of these stones across South Africa where sister Maris will be in Heras to change that one to white. We will be there brother. Thank you. But this is how it is from vend right across on every church building of El Tabernacle. It's the church ages Jesus and the megers. Then it has the cross and a star and the seven thunders because the seven thunders is the messengers that El tabernacle follows. Amen. And it's to the glory of God and it's got love and faith and all the virtues. It's got the names of the messengers and it gives you every church age. He has scriptures here. If you want to have scriptures to read before you go into church, there's scriptures given for you before you come in here. It will give you insight to what else heaven. It's written there. That's why we put it down there. Now I know you just walk into church but if you're in Bloomington Estras wherever those scriptures down and read it which I know you didn't see you just put your hand on it but there's scriptures there to be read that the apostle put for a reason and all this has been laid by the apostle E H Ros Rosco all of you boulder and founder of Eaban. He's our rose because he says I am the rose of Sher. He's our rose. And it says here it was done on the of the 2025. Let's give a lot of shabbak for that. [Applause] Amen. God bless you.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] It's very quiet in here. Amen. [Applause] [Music] Heat up here. [Music] [Music] In 1979, the message of the hour was in a graveyard. There was no hallelujah. [Music] There was no Holy Ghost. There was no people shouting on the top of their voices. But I want you to know 1979 came and the message is still trembling today because of 1979. That's why I say it's a bit quiet in here. [Music] The devil knows that 79 the silence was broken and it will never be silent again. Hallelujah. And today, [Music] Satan, right in this moment, it's 79 again. That's why I say it's very quiet in here. It's very quiet in here. After all that singing, after that the morning when the sun came up, Satan, it's 79 [Music] again. When God's house will never be quiet because when the man came around, he broke the silence. The man came around [Music] Hallelujah. If you still waiting for something, just shout. You still confused what where you are, just open your mouth and [Music] [Music] Wherever Jesus [Music] You'll hear a lot of noise. So, I want to greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ. I'm so glad that the apostle invited me to his [Music] birthday. Me, the least of all, he he invited me to be here. And what makes it worse, he asked me to say something. Oh, I feel honored. Out of 8 billion, I made it. [Music] Yeah. Same as [Music] somebody. So from the bottom of my heart, I want to [Music] say to this body that carries the power of God. Happy birthday, man of God. [Applause] [Music] I have a saying to my father every now and then when I look at him when I saw him say when he was 60 when he preached crossing the line he said I'm an old man but now I don't believe he's an old man there's a young man living in this [Music] Morning. Hallelujah. And I keep saying to the apostle, do me a favor, Daddy. Just keep on breathing. When CO came, I said, \"Oh, God man, just keep on breathing.\" And I'm so glad it is here with us today. words runs out when it comes to Apostle Ros. You can't say enough. It doesn't do justice to the work that God has done in our [Music] tabernacle. I just want to read a scripture or two. I don't have much to say. [Music] And the Bible says in Job 42:12, so the Lord blessed the letter of Job more of his blessings than what he began. The letter part of Job was blessed more. And I can see it and I'm a witness of it that the latter part was more blessed than when Job was blessed. So in blessing, God has blessed this man. Are you a witness of the letter? [Music] And just before that, the man that accused him of sin, God told those men, if that man don't pray for you, you're in trouble. And I'm so glad he prayed for all of us and we are not in [Music] trouble. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh my my my my. Can I just say something quickly? Paul says, \"Ye are all partakers. You are all partakers of my grace.\" And I am a witness today that today and this Revelation stand series and crossing the line, we are all partakers of God's apostles grace because God gave him grace. We are here. Are you here? I can't hear El tabernacle. [Music] Hallelujah. Grace has come our way. [Music] And we want to say thank you to the Lord. It's quiet all over. The message, the internet, the preaching, the moving of the spirit has gone quiet all over and it's getting quieter. But in El Tabernacle, there's a man [Music] [Applause] Now in the book of Genesis, I'm not going to be long. I pastor Jude will be come after me [Music] today. And while I'm on that point, he asked tomorrow to preach for his father. So, we'll be broadcasting tomorrow cuz it's our father. [Applause] [Music] Amen. Although there's many rostals around, but at least it's our father. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Before I finish up, Pastor Paul made a wish to the man of God. And he said that at the latter time he brother Bam say he'll choose to come to the earth to help God's people. I feel we already helped why why why the god man gave you the greatest thing that any man could give you. The greatest thing in the world he gave to our tabernacle. Can you tell me what is that gift that he gave? So if he has given you the Holy Ghost, you can't give him a greater gift back. You receive the greatest [Music] gift. Hallelujah. And I was thinking in the book of Genesis, there was a man whose name started with a E. He was the seventh from Adam. And it was in the book of Genesis. There was a man whose name started with an E. And the Bible says this man walked with God. [Applause] And when I heard them sing that song, I can't even walk unless he holds my hand. I realized God has another man whose name starts with an E and he walks with God. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] My father flies pigeons and he can see every bird in the kit at his age without glasses. I can't see who's behind in the church, but those dove eyes still sees better than his son's [Music] [Applause] eyes. And Enoch walked with God and he was not. that I believe in Revelations 10, there's another man with a ear. Revelations 10:8 and he also walks with God. Pray for the man of God. Love him more. Appreciate him more. Do what he says. And like he said, don't follow us. Follow that dove. Happy birthday to you, my father. I really love you. You've been more than a father to me. And thanks for coming every time for my soul. I'm a preacher today because he allowed me to keep his mic. This will never be my mic, but my father allowed me as a preacher to keep his mic. We love you pastor Apostle and we know that we'll understand it in the by and by you. Many a day wanted to leave this church but you are back here this afternoon. There's something in this place that's holding the reigns. May God bless you. Happy birthday daddy. God bless you. Amen. [Music] [Applause] We can do much better than that, church. Thank you, Pastor Jonathan Ross. Let's give him a shout. Hallelujah. While we welcome our precious pastor, Jude Rosco, let's give him a mighty, mighty, mighty hand. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] We greet each one in the name of the Lord this afternoon. [Applause] God is so good to us that he sent a gift our way in this hour. [Applause] And so what's so nice, he made the 21st of March a holiday so that we could be here this afternoon. [Music] [Music] [Applause] In 1946, on 21st of March, God brought a gift to the [Music] earth to help you and to help me. Amen. And the amazing thing is we are still very happy that God's gift is still with us. Amen. And leading us on. Amen. [Applause] [Music] I told the apostle in the week I met him at Mall of the South by chance. I said I the the fasting day I listened to silence part two. I said even if somebody could have those notes they wouldn't be able to preach it like that. Even if you listen to it and try to copy it, you won't be able to preach it like that. It was meant to come out of one man's lips. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. And what's so heavy is the anointing on those messages. [Applause] No matter how you feel when you put it on, devils and demons runs. Amen. [Applause] That's why I say like Pastor John, it's an honor to say [Applause] something at our apostles birthday. You don't know what to say. Words like Pastor John says fails you. There's so many things to say. And uh I think sometimes words doesn't make justice to what has been put in to this ministry. [Applause] And uh I always wondered what my mother meant when she said, \"You know, Edgar, me and you, we die with our boots on.\" Hallelujah. We work until we die. And it was so funny when she was in the accident and thrown out of the car, her shoes still stayed on her feet. She was trying to tell us, \"I died with my boots on.\" Amen. And I want to tell her on the other side, my father still got his boots on. We we don't wish him anything because he already has what we want to wish him for. Amen. [Applause] I just want to read two scriptures. Psalms 90 verse 10. The days of our years are three score and three score years and 10 that 70 is allotted to men. And if by reason of strength they be four score years even they four score years 80 years. The Bible says yet is their strength labor and sorrows. When the apostle reached 70, we thought it will be smooth sailing. But even if him living up till now, it came with labor and it came with sorrows. But I thank God that it's Revelations 10:8. Sweet in your mouth, butter in your belly. But what I like of our apostl, he doesn't care about the bitterness. He concentrates on the sweetness. Amen. And I can say that song is fulfilled in his life. We'll work until Jesus come. We'll work until he comes. The apostle is working. Amen. And we appreciate him for that. Amen. That's why we are here this afternoon to come and celebrate his birthday. [Applause] Amen. That's why I'm nearly there. Zechariah 4:7 says, verse 6 says, \"Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, this is the word of the Lord unto Jerubabel, saying, not by might, nor by power, but my spirit, say the Lord of hosts.\" He never came with might. He never came with power. But this apostle came with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You don't overcome by power. You don't overcome by might. God says, \"Not by power, not by might, but by my my spirit, says the Lord of hosts.\" [Applause] Amen. And the spirit did come and the Holy Ghost did fall. Hallelujah. Here's the Here's the witnesses. Each flag the Holy Ghost fell in every country. Amen. Over 40 countries the Holy Ghost did come. [Applause] Who art thou, oh great mountain, before Jerubabel? Thou shalt become a plain, and he shall bring forth a headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, grace, grace. Oh hallelujah. I thank God that the headstone came spring grace grace the mercy seat. Amen. For you and for [Applause] me. Grace. Grace already came. But we have double grace. If a man lives after 70, it's grace. If he lives to 75, it's grace. If he lives beyond 75, it's double grace because grace is number five. Five and five. Amen. That's why we thank God that the headstone cried grace, grace to El Tabernacle. [Applause] That's why we say apostle age is simply the number of years that the world has been enjoying you. We have been enjoying you. The world has been enjoying you for 79 years. El tabernacle. Have you been enjoying God's apostle? [Music] [Applause] Amen. You might be enjoying him for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. But before that some people has been enjoying him for the his young age and all the world has enjoyed him for all these years. Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. As the CRS leader comes up. Amen. Getting old is like climbing a mountain. Hallelujah. I thank God that this man was climbing permit mountain. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Applause] The older he got, the higher he climbed, the wiser he became. The higher he climbed, the further he saw. The higher he went up the tower, the further he could see. Amen. Hallelujah. Can you say amen? Y tabernacle. Can you say praise the Lord? Y tabernacle. [Applause] The older he got, he must have got out of breath. The higher he went. [Applause] The higher he went, the slower he might have gone, but as long as he went [Applause] higher. The higher the eagle goes, the further he [Music] sees. At 79, we want to tell the devil, he went higher and he looked further. [Applause] [Music] The higher you go, the better the view is. And we want to say, Apostle, enjoy the view. Apostle, tell us what's going on on the other side. The further you see, Apostle, tell us what's going to happen. the higher you [Music] go. Daddy, we love you. We appreciate you. We thank you for all your labors. We thank you, Lord, for not giving up on us and fighting the fight. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] The higher you go, Apostle Take us with you. Pull us with you higher and higher. God bless you. Amen. Oh. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Don't you appreciate Pastor Jun Rosco? No, we can do better than that. [Applause] [Music] just for a short while just give him thanks. Thank you Lord. Thank you [Music] Lord. Thank you for our pastor Lord. Thank you for keeping him Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, happy birthday, my apostle. There's a lady, a special lady that we would like to call the granddaughter of the apostle, the daughter of our senior pastor, Jonathan Rosco, Sister Esther. If she can come, let's give her a wonderful warm hand. [Applause] God bless you saints. We are gathered here today to honor a truly special man, a true man of God, a legend. A man, a man known in the heavens and known around this world. On behalf of the Rosco grandchildren, I'm truly honored as your first granddaughter to deliver a speech to our phenomenal grandfather. Today we the grandchildren have hearts full of gratitude for a man who has not only been our grandfather but also our apostle who has been a guiding light and a pillar of strength in our lives. Our grandfather is not just any man. He's a man of God. A true shepherd. A true shepherd who has dedicated his entire life to preaching the gospel, leading his flock and living out the word with unwavering faith and dedication. Through his sermons and his prayers and most importantly his example, he has shown us what it means to walk with God. The Bible says in Proverbs 13:22, \"A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children.\" Many measure inheritance in material wealth. But our grandfather has given us something far greater. The inheritance of the Holy Ghost, the good news. He has shown us that the greatest gift a man can pass down is not riches, but a life rooted in Christ. A legacy of faith and the power of the Holy Spirit working within us. Growing up under his influence has been a blessing beyond measure. His wisdom has shaped us. His prayers covered us. His love has given us strength to live each day with God on our side. Whether through a kind word, a firm lesson, or a simple moment of laughter, he has always reminded us that faith in God is not just something we speak about, but something we live by. Grandpa, your life has been a testimony of faithfulness, perseverance, unwavering trust in the Lord. You have taught us that no matter how difficult the journey, God is always in control, you have shown us what it means to serve with humility, love without conditions, and lead with a heart full of grace. Our family is blessed with many cherished testimonies that continue to deepen our faith in this great, glorious ministry. I too have a testimony. after countless persons to a few doctors. It was only through your prayers, grandpa, that opened my womb, leaving doctors confused and amazed, that I suddenly got to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] see. And for that, I'm so thankful, Grandpa. All as a daily reminder that God can do miracles. [Music] The power of God has moved throughout our lives, each and every one of us in this family, pinpointing to the fact that God truly walks with you, grandpa. And we cannot deny it. [Applause] [Music] On behalf of all your grandchildren, we want to say thank you. Thank you for always thinking of us, your grandchildren. Thank you for this great and glorious ministry you've built. Thank you for building a school, a safe haven that molded us. Thank you for all the praise that is keeping us for your wisdom, for your love and for your and for your spiritual legacy you have given us. All we have is because of you grandpa. We are proud to be your grandchildren and we pray that God continues to bless you with strength, good health, and the joy in the Holy Ghost. The 79th birthday, thank you for everything, Grandpa. No amount of words or actions will truly describe what you mean to us. It's because of you that we can be who we the people we are today. We love you, Grandpa. We salute you. May God bless you abundantly and may you enjoy your special day with love from your grandchildren. God bless. [Music] I know you well, but you can't lie to me with all those spoken words you don't let. I'm not trying to follow you to the end of the world. I'm just trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus in [Music] God. Words have come from man no Bible. Oh, but I can't help thinking that I heard the wrong crowd. When the Holy Ghost is gone, my job will be true. And I'm trying to leave something behind in the foot of Jesus.

We swallow the moon, but we don't know why. the case but we know I'm trying to something of Jesus I believe we are all I've Heat. Heat. of Jesus. Now there is a ten Yeah. Heat.

the pit than anywhere else I don't think there's a pastor that's uh so much in the poopit like uh I am that's why I read that quotation scripture where Paul says I labored more than them all and um I can't stop laboring I'm a workaholic Hallelujah I like my [Applause] job you may be seated amen I am I said I'm going to come this Wednesday to make this clip um about the quotation that brother Sol renica gave us and gave me um that he said he's got the quote where brother Brenham said um you receive the Holy Ghost without emotions and although I told him there is no quote because since 1979 I was was nailing this thing down and if and I call it the Cod and if had a quot you would have blasted me if Gideon had the quot you would have blasted me Beckett had a quote and the whole world went after that quote somewhere in the world would have blasted me and put that quote up and I told him there is no quote like that and then he made a mistake to say that no no received the Holy Ghost without Sensations I said there only one it says this is a Time page 32 and if it's that quote you don't send it to me I got the quote I say you don't have the quote you know so for all these years I've been nailing the thing down and I was shocked that he said he's got a quote and that's why I said I'll give you two weeks and one Wednesday I will come and say whether there is a court like that or whether there is not a court like that and I ask all the the brainy guys you know in in U in elano you know the engineers and uh and and and and the guys with the diplomas from the University you see I come from u a spiritual University and um we gave it two weeks from two we Wednesday when I had a confrontation with him and they've been searching and I asked a few pastors and they told me we're not even going to look because there's nothing like that you know so they just switched me off uh immediately we're not going to waste our time you know there's nothing like that so um finally today is two weeks is up and none of the brainy guys the university guys could find a quote like that so there is no quote like that and another clever guy in the message with us you know that guy very clever in school he came first most of the time you know and he also went through University and he says uh Pastor uh I also looked but I can't find it I said well then I was right for all this years since 1979 so s REO was lying again he lied playing down he lied and you can see that hits of uh the combine I think it's going to 8,000 now and you know you got to times that by bang bang bang because most of them don't listen to it alone so are we near the time that we take it off because we take it off if the hits is above six then we take it off because then we know know the whole world has heard it so um I think the whole world has heard it and I think they're going to sit him flat on that one and also I can understand now why he sits at Will's church because he never danced in his life he never woried he never shouted he never jumped in his life I never seen him do that here I never saw him do it at Raymond's I never saw him do it in tukum serus the only thing he done was to to go against the pits went against my pit went against Raymond's pit went against tok's pit and then also if he feels that uh a minister cannot tell him anything then he leaves and he going sits in the car my wife used to get a fit for that thing and out in tukum I believe Georgie also done the same thing now who the heck are they and they know nothing sir I have never given a guy a hiding a spanking like I gave Sol renica [Music] he came the worst of of them all and he had to start lying you know when you when you get a guy in a corner he's either going to admit or he's going to lie to get out of the corner and I hope that Raymond Thompson told him that he never bought the tape and Ne neither the tape recorders you see the thing that God gave me in Revelations 10:8 nobody had it to think that this Mighty God kept this thing a secret he kept his mouth closed and then he revealed it after he broke it he revealed it to the prophet Revelations 10:7 then nobody saw anything it was on white granite rock then 2023 he says now come on Edgar check that rock and it's still bursting I don't have any time that angel keep me busy telling you I'm busy some sometimes was awake I'm you know I am awake between 2: and 4: in the morning since a young man and I'm an old man I still wake up that time amen you know I sometimes ask mhari to to phone me when I have to get up early and then uh the time she phone I already had a shower I already dressed I'm starting to make myself coffee you know but just in case my age you know will let me that day sleep a little late but it hasn't happened yet so I never disappointed you in praying for you between 2: and 4: in the morning I pray for El tle I never fail and now now now that's all the grace of God it's not me it's God Amen so um he tried to stop it you know and you you'll hear uh the end of the month sir I just finished the messages I got messages until August it's laying it's finished and the end of the month one you'll hear me say there and show you uh when the lion roars who can but prophesy he doesn't say the prophets prophesy he says the who Edgar Osco will hear the Roar of the Lion you watch the end of the month or we're going to preach on that and I'm going to have a prayer line the end of the month he told me to with that message I must have a prayer line so the end of the month we're going to have a prayer line it's going to be announced you know so he says who can stop them after the lon law nobody can stop me not even Sol Rica am man he's nothing he never can you know he thought he stopped me with a split but here I am I'm better of than when he was here he thought he'll stop me at sao's funeral when he walked up out him and his wife as I walked towards the podium he walked out he thought he was going to stop me and I laughed Within Myself he said said that you know I left because I couldn't see the seven Thunders being the Seven Virtues but El Li he Li he walked out by Raymond maybe not believing the seven Thunders seven verges but he didn't leave Raymond chased him away and one of the brothers was in the church and he was hardly in his car and that brother phoned me to say hey man Raymond chase this guy away like a dog I said but how did he look he says the only way I can describe it is a dog with his tail between his legs that's how Sol can walk out of Raymond's church then Raymond looked and he saw this brother in my church sitting there then he says I don't even care if you're going to tell Edgar Rosco because I'm not Edgar Rosco s and you people that sitting here that that that that likes him someone walk out with him that's how he chased Sol away and then I I asked the brothers then who got up and walked out with him he says nobody not not I didn't see anybody walk out with him he walked out alone the professor now the professor is going to be taught by little boys in the message is going to finish him now you don't come up against anointed of God so that I needed to tell the church because I said tonight I am going to and um we couldn't find the tape the the quot and you that's going to listen to me on this clip right around the world as you all are listening to me anyhow you know yeah it's quite something man you all know Sol R Canal so he's not that guy that he keeps himself you know even I was waiting for Jonathan to be born for 2 years you know and after 2 years she only fell pregnant and uh I read the book of Jude and I was really impressed with the with the book of Jude because it's the book before Revelations so I said if I get a boy I'm going to name his name Jude and Jonathan came and he was a boy and I was going to call his named Jude and so Reno went to my mother-in-law and said Jude means Judas and my mother-in-law came up against me and says you're not going to name your son Jude and that's why we changed judee's uh Jonathan's name uh from Jude to Jonathan because of Sol renica and then what happened was uh I looked at this guy and says man Edgar rosu don't get stopped I said if I get the next boy nobody but is going to stop itall I'm a hell of a station masterj when Jude got born I said welcome home Jude nobody stopped me now Jude does mean the other word is Judas but the main word for Jude is Judah the line of the tribe of Judah and here that lion is roaring of Judah in E Tabernacle and S can't take it can't stop a man of God even mingled in my family [Applause] so I am what I am and I'm so sure I mean Daniel played me a club 198 to solica says I trust Edgar Rosa with My Soul it's right on tape but he never did he's a great Pretender that's all that he is he pretends so I thought that I was finished with Joe Daniels and this so I asked God I said Lord now I got two 2 hours in the morning to talk to God and I said Lord why every time I must do a thing like this so he says no this guy was hiding and he was the main culprit he say so he also has to be exposed I'm going to close with this he said to me he said yeah you straighten out everybody I said yeah I did straighten them out he says but nobody left the churches they still believe what they believe I said well I didn't expect them to come I said when after brother brandham straightened out everybody who came 300 of them were supposed to be baptized they never came I said Jesus Christ straightened out everybody yes sir and nobody came yes sir I said but one thing I'm going to tell you brother s they all worried after they heard they must get the Holy Ghost with emotions and they didn't get it that way they are worried because they don't have the token then and if they don't have the token they are none of Christ and they cannot make it and the Death Angel will take them if they don't have now how did you like Sunday when I brought out the mystery of the Holy Ghost without emotions right in the Bible that mystery was only revealed in E Tabernacle you can shout louder than that man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen so that mystery is also made known because we got the Holy Ghost we got it and we're giving it out we don't only talk about it people experience it they get drunk they can chuck on the floor they scream

I went to his house but the Holy Ghost is gone. I came to his house and Holy Ghost is gone. But I tried to leave something behind us. [Music] Now there is a beast that's taken my brain. You can put me to bed, but you can't feel my pain. You could put me to bed, but you can't bear my pain. Leaving the soul from the I'm just trying. I'm trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus God. [Music] is free but the [Music] holy cost more than our [Music] bra come by simply it's so hard to read the future ahead it's already and it's time to leave hunting behind in the footprints of Jesus [Music] King. Now I've got this feeling that I'm still at the shore and my pockets don't know what it means to be poor. I can get through the wall if you give me a door. All the doors is closed. It's time to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus King. Oh, wisdom is lost in the trees somewhere and you're not going to find it. It's a mental [Music] break. It's locked up from those who hurry ahead. It's time to leave something behind the foot of Jesus [Applause] God. All the money and the ceiling is hard [Music] to when my son stands as a statue of God. He will know what I [Music] meant. Try to leave something behind. I was trying to leave something behind. I was trying to leave something behind. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'd Like I'd like to take a scripture out of St. John 1. It's 46, 47, and 48. And Nathaniel said unto him, \"Can there any good thing come out of the El Tabernacle? Philip saith unto him, \"Come and see if something good is in Al Teabernc.\" [Applause] Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him. Yes. Amen. and sayith unto him, \"Behold, an Israelite indeed in whom is no G.\" [Music] Then Nathaniel saith unto him, Whence knoweth thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, \"Before that film called thee, when thou was under the fig tree, I saw thee.\" Amen. Let us pray. Father, we thank you for the reading of your word. May our past catch up with our future [Music] as Nathaniel's past caught up in his future. [Music] I do pray that you'd undertake for us. Lord, on my birthday, I wanted church. and you gave it to me. What a boom day present. Church. Thank you that I could be in church with people that was there. with me in the confidence to celebrate the gift that you gave Lord. What a gift. Pray that you'd undertake for us in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. I will take a title from there. I just want to leave something behind. [Applause] [Music] I just want to leave on this birthday something behind. Nathaniel asked him the question, \"Since when do you know me?\" He says, \"When you were in a fig under the fig tree the other day, Now the minute you say I leave something behind, it means that you showed to the past. So Nathaniel, it might have been a couple of days ago in the past. I saw you, but now your past has caught up with your future. And I want to say El Tabernacle, your past has caught up with you in this future that you're living in tonight. Brother Brandham says, \"If you weren't there in the beginning, in the past, you're never going to be there in the future.\" And that is what it is. I'll leave something behind. And brother Brandham took a song on the wings of a snow white dove and he add words to that song that was on the hip parade [Applause] and he put himself in that song. Though I have suffered, in many ways I cried for healing, he took that song and he pleaded on the wings of a snow white dove. Brother Brandham, when he got near his wife and they were laying on the bed, Amen. And he looked into our eyes and he wanted to serenate her. Amen. He wanted to have a loving evening. And then the prophet will take that song. You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are blue. It takes a song. And then and then he preached a whole message. Loving he loved me. dying. He saved me a whole song. He takes that and he starts preaching a message on it. So I tonight want to take this song in all that I tried to do for 79 years. I was just trying to leave something behind. Everybody leaves something behind. Don't care who you are, bad or good, you leave something behind. Some leaves big wolves behind with a lot of money, but they leave something behind. Others leaves a lot of credit behind, but you leave something behind. Others leave legacies, great legacies, but you leave something behind. Others leaves disappointments and that too you leave [Applause] behind. The thing you leave behind become a memory. People remembers. Look at every funeral you attend. They will come and says, \"Well, he did this and this and this.\" What they left something behind. Memories gets left behind. And from memories it become history. And history makes memorials [Applause] because you just left something behind. The great guys of yesterday year left something behind. [Applause] They always leave something behind, something that people could remember them by. Jenkins Khn left something behind. Alexander the Great left something behind. Napoleon Bonapart left something behind. Hitler left something behind. Pelle left something behind. Jack Nicholas with a golf left something behind. You can be a great guy, you're going to leave something behind. You can be a nobody and yet you're going to leave something behind. soul. William Brennham. Yes. Amen. When he cried out, I'm going to leave this Bible for Joseph. Brother Brennan left something behind. Brother Brennham when he took the cloud and he turned the cloud and he said this will go down in history what did he do? He left something behind. Amen. Amen. The pillar of fire that was at the back of his head. Amen. That's hanging all over where you went and go. What was that? He left something behind. All the mysteries of the entire Bible, every nuke, every corner in the Bible, he revealed it. What did he do? He put it on tape because he wanted to leave something behind. Jesus, King God. [Music] When he says, \"I have to go to my father, but I'll send you a comforter.\" He left something behind. He said, he said, \"I must go so that he can come because I'm leaving him behind to lead you into all truth.\" Yes, he left something behind. Jesus, King God. [Music] When he took his final step and he looked back, he saw footprints on the sands of time that's leading to the promised land. What did he do? I can't hear you. What did he do? He left footprints behind. He left something behind. He left something for you to follow. He left something for you to to be guided because he left something behind. [Music] Oh my [Applause] Paul left something behind. So if anybody comes and says seven thunders and seven virtues let him be a curse because even if it's an angel because I left something behind. [Applause] And then I came [Music] to this place. I went before the beginning. I went in the beginning and I end from the beginning. [Applause] [Music] Woo! Hallelujah. [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Applause] Yes. Yes. Yes. I went before the beginning and I came out to a place before the beginning at the great conference of God. And there we were sitting. Amen. In the great conference of God. And here God saw the deceitfulness of Satan before Satan was actually created. God save our souls already. Took the lamb and slay the lamb. I just wanted to leave. I just wanted to leave. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] And I look 3.5 billion years ago and God formed the earth 3.5 billion years ago. And as he forms the earth, the ones names that was in the lamb's book of life, they were there already. And they looked at him creating the earth. And the Bible says in the book of Job, where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy when he laid the foundation, I just want to leave something behind. I don't think Lucifer wanted to hear that one. And the sons of God was shouting for joy. And right now, tonight, God's got another man that makes the sons and the daughters of God shout for joy for a new creation. I just wanted to leave something behind. And while while we were shouting, while we were screaming, while we were drunk in the spirit, Lucifer didn't like it. and it caused trouble in heaven. And God says, \"Any man that makes trouble in my church, I kick him out.\" And I saw Lucifer fall down. How have I fallen on Lucifer? And we're kicking him out here tonight because the sons of God is here tonight. Heat. Heat. Thank you. Yeah. [Applause] When I preached that, hallelujah. When I preach that, what did you do, brother Rosco? I just wanted to leave something behind and God made in Eden and I see him drop down in Eden. Lucifer in the body of the serpent a handsome man. The Bible call him a cherubam. Which cherubam? The man cheruban. The one with the face of a man. He was thrown out. Amen. Into the Garden of Eden. And I look at this cherubam. Amen. A man, a serpent. And then I saw what that serpent could do. The weakness of a man. That's why God had to destroy him because Eve would have ran after him all the time and God slayed him. Then I saw evolution coming right up to the serpent. Lord, I saw the chimpanzee. I saw the H Highleberg man. I saw the Nebraska man. I saw the Bolton down man. I saw the peeking man. I saw the neon grateral man. I see the cro-Magnum man. And then I see the serpent man. And then I see the modern man. Amen. Adam. But also then I saw the real man, the only man, the son of man. I just wanted to leave something behind. And I hear a prophet says there'll come a man one time and he'll preach evolution and nobody in the message preach evolution, but he send a boy that is a man. Now I just wanted to [Music] leave something behind. And finally the man came. When he came He was full of blood, thorns on his head. And he stood in front of Pilate. And Pilate looked at him and he looked at this congressman and he says, \"Behold the man, the only man I just wanted to leave something behind. [Applause] Brother Brennham was compelled to come to South Africa 1951. There was a reason why he came because there was a little boy [Applause] And that little boy has become a man. And now he just want to leave something behind. That the prophet laid hands on this head. I just wanted to leave something [Music] behind. Sitting in my study, here come a letter from Billy Paul. And in the letter, Billy Paul says, \"Edgar Roscoll, I only listen to my father and you because you got a very fine spirit. I just wanted to leave something behind. From brother Brandham to Billy Paul, from Billy Paul to brother Higginson, the head deacon of Brennham tabernacle and he came into the sanctuary and he felt the anointing and he said the anointing that's here was the same anointing when brother Brandham preached the same the scripture. is fulfilled and this day the scripture is fulfilled. I just wanted to leave something behind from brother Brandham to Billy Paul to the head deacon of Brandham Tabernacle. knows that something has been left behind. El tabernacle, even Jeffersonville had to acknowledge there's going to come somebody that's going to leave something behind. I can't help who I am because I was chosen to leave something behind. Will brother Stephford come up please? Brother [Music] Steph and this cherubam was walking in the garden of Eden. That's why When we hear we devil chasing. Amen. You sisters that don't respect your husband, we one of these days are going to put you out of the church. Your husbands that don't love your wives, we're going to put you out of the church [Applause] because there is somebody that God said leave something behind. Brother Stephen, will you just give them the testimony so that we can just leave it behind. Thank you. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap. Amen. The apostle just wants me to share a short testimony with you. Amen. I was working in this company and in one of our subsidiary companies was a colored guy and this guy wanted an appointment with me and every time he comes to my office I wasn't available and then I said to my PA I said listen just schedule this appointment with this guy. tell him when he comes we make an appointment and I'll see him. So he came and he came under the guise of wanting career advice. But really I could hear when we started to talk. He said he knows I'm a Christian. He knows where I serve El Tabernacle. He knows my apostle Edgar Rosco. So I said to this guy, his name is Nathan Operman. So I said, \"Nathan, how do you know my apostle?\" He says, \"Brother Stephford, let me tell you something.\" He says, \"My father is like a bishop in the AFM church.\" And around the late 70s, I think around 1977, Kenneth Hagen came to South Africa and he had an audience with Kenneth Hagen, his father Andrew Operman. And this young boy Nathan, he went with his father and he was sitting there when Kenneth Hagen spoke to his father. And Kenneth Hagen said to his father, that was around 1977 when he came to South Africa. He said, \"You need to associate yourself with a man by the name of Edgar Rosco. He said that man carries the power of God. And you know as we were talking it only became clear to me. So I told him about the church and all that but it only the puzzle came together only later when his father put in his will that when he dies the apostle must bury him. [Applause] So, this was something phenomenal to me and we wanted to get it on tape and we spoke to him and he said, \"No, we'll do it. It'll come on tape.\" But by the time we wanted to finalize it, he had stage four cancer and within 4 days after speaking to me, he passed away. But his father was buried by the apostle and we all know the rest is history what happened at that service. So to the man of God we salute you and we want to say happy birthday pastor. You definitely left something behind. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Now that's the same man that Sol Ranica and them was under that was his mentor. Every Tuesday they had studies with Andrew Oppaman and Andrew Oppaman's got a better chance than Solar Renica. Exactly. And I do not know Kenneth Copelan and all those guys, but you know, God does things like this just to leave something behind. What fruit is on the tree? One of the elders said to John the bride, hallelujah, part in El Tabernacle. told you, \"Weep not. You're safe. Weep not, John. You're safe. Just follow the footsteps that's left behind. And I asked the Holy Ghost, who is that elder? And nobody ever mentioned it. And it came down that elder is none else than Paul because Paul was in the third heaven and Paul saw the lamb there that takes away the sons of the world and he cried out, \"Don't cry. The line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed. And I came and told you now I leave something behind. Oh my. And that anointed cherubam. It reminds me of the two cherubams that's on the ark. On the one side, the face of a man and on the other side, the face of a lion. Now, you never heard this in a message. They know nothing. Who's that? Two cherubams. Face of a man and a face of a lion. couldn't have been anybody else because the lion of the tribe of Judah has become a man and he poured out his blood on the mercy seat. Hallelujah. I'm just leaving something behind. That was not good enough. I just want to young people. I just want to I just want to leave something behind. Thank you. I was laying in my bed in Jerusalem. Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how beautiful is your mountains. And when David saw it, he says, \"I lift up my eyes towards the mountains where from my strength come.\" I was lying in between the mountains of Jerusalem and he came down and he told me, \"You're not going outside seeing today.\" I said, \"Lord, why can't I go out today?\" Said, \"You s and you read Revelations 10.\" I said, \"But I I know Revelations 10. It's my bread and my butter, Lord.\" He said, \"You stay behind in Jerusalem.\" I went down. And I said, \"Lovey, I can't go out. I can't go sightseeing. I can't go out with you. I must stay.\" He told me to read a Revelation 10. And they left and I was in the room alone between the mountains that David saw. And shortly here round about 11:00 I think my strength came from the mountains. And as I read Revelations 10, I saw that the Bible says, \"And when the seven thunders uttered there,\" he says, \"Stop there.\" You said that's that's a word that you couldn't spell. When you spell there, you spell it t h e r e. But this is t h e i r. This is human beings. And if the seven thunders are there is seven human beings. And what is utter? Utter means speech. What is utter means preaching. He says the seven thundersu is the seven messengers of the seven church ages and the revelation came down where my strength come. Hallelujah. I just want to leave something behind. [Music] Oh my [Music] [Applause] And then [Applause] to 20 24, he said, pick up Revelations 10 again and read it through. I must still come back and preach the entire Bible folded in Revelations 10. It might it might be the whole year. I don't know. And I started to read it verse by verse. And I came to Revelations 10:8. And I saw Brother Bram says, \"That's the bride.\" He said, \"But now watch now. It's the bride. But the sisters is in the bride, too. But they don't prophesy. It's only men that prophesy. So it must be in the five-fold ministry that prophesy.\" And I he said to me, \"Now, who in the five-fold ministry is prophesying again?\" And I wasn't ashamed to tell him Edgar Rosco Revelations 10:8. Hallelujah. I just want to leave something behind. [Music] [Applause] And then he gave me Revelations 22 to hook up with Revelations 10:8. Amen. John, see that you don't seal up the prophecy. Now, how could he not seal up the prophecy if he's not going to prophesy again? The only way to keep it open, preach on it for a whole year. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] Then I went around the world in a message and all that I heard the word. The word the word the word spokes quotes the word. And I said, \"Lord, there's something wrong here.\" And then he spoke to my heart. He says, \"Edgar, there's four parts to the word.\" [Applause] Oh, I said, \"Lord, which four parts?\" He says, \"The written word don't save you.\" Everybody preach it. The spoken word don't save you. That's for third Paul. Squirrels. The revealed word don't save you. The minute he says flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you, Peter, the next verse says God told him, \"Get behind me, Satan. That don't save you.\" But what saves you? The living manifested word is the only thing that saves you. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] Amen. The loving word saves you. Why? Amen. Then he opens the Bible for me. He says, \"Some seeds fall on rocky places. That don't save you. Other seeds fall in between thorns and it gets choked. That don't save you. other word word word falls on dry places that don't save you. So it's not word word but the word that falls on good ground that saves you. Four parts to the word of God. I just want to leave something behind. And then another thing that made me sick is whenever I go, brother, you got to love, man. You got to love, brother. You know, Brother Rosco's got no love. You know, there's no love. Nothing. Amen. And then I walked up and I found in the message rejected King. Brother Brandham says the Holy Ghost is love. [Music] [Applause] Then I found out that the book of Galatians says love is only a fruit of the spirit. Not the spirit is the fruit of love. Love comes out of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Cannot be any other way. only a fruit. Only a fruit. Then I read Romans 5:5. Could you read it with me? Romans 5:5. How does the love come into your heart? So without the Holy Ghost, no love. [Music] There is seven steps of love. Which love are you talking about? Amen. My Lord. Amen. And amen. Lord. Hey. Then he sings on the wings of the snow. White. What is the white dove? He says, \"And love is on the wings of a dove to the wings of the Holy Ghost.\" Oh, and then I read in the Bible, there's only a time to love. You can't laugh all the time. When are you going to get a re a time to rebuke? When are you going to get a time to hate sin? And there's only a time to laugh. But you want to laugh all the time. When Jesus knocked them out of the temple, where was love? [Applause] Hey, I just wanted to leave something behind. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] The 1979 I walk into the classroom still under the umbrella of the teeth the Holy Ghost without emotions. And when I went in there and preached for 10 minutes chairs went through the window, sisters got slain. The hallelujah and the glory to God was like they shouted for joy. And the Holy Ghost fell from 79 until now. And it never stop. And it won't stop. I won't let it stop because I'm leaving something behind. Enjoy the Holy Ghost. Enjoy the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Oh my. Can I have another few moments? that I heard the other day. They said the initial evidence is when the word of God says, \"Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe?\" And then they turn around believe what the message for your day. They said, \"That's the evidence.\" Now, the Holy Ghost told me that's right. Did you believe the word for your day since you received the Holy Ghost. They say that's it. But my problem is is dancing in the word, is shouting in the word, is being drunk in the word. Then why don't you believe it and do it? You're a liar. Faith without works is dead. I just wanted to leave something behind. Listen, then Phil thief came when the Holy Ghost poured out in Al tabernacle and he came and he said the Holy Ghost with no emotions. Now there is no quote for that but put that back in the Bible. Where are they going to put it? I know where it is. And I told you where it is. Acts chapter 2, there came a rushing mighty wind, the Holy Ghost. No emotions. It fell up the house. No emotions. They were sitting. No emotions. They had cloven tongues over their heads. no emotions. But after that, the Bible says, \"And they received the Holy Ghost and emotions came.\" Oh, put it back in the Bible. I just want to I just want to I just want to leave something behind. Oh my And then I thought, brother, I thought that I'm screaming. I'm shouting. I am dancing. I'm getting drunk. I'm acting stupid. I thought it it's me. And then I picked up a quote. Brother Graham says it's not you. Is the angel of God inside of you shouting, screaming, dancing. It's not you who's screaming there. I see the angels of God. And then we came back and we took the quote to brother B says turn the cloud to your right side. turn it to the right side the cloud. And then I read he says he's got a wig on. And then I saw he say it's the judge. [Applause] 1963 it's the judge. Do you know that we already judged by the word of the prophet? So, we're not going to the white throne because the white throne is the word of God judging. But the judge already came. And I see a a prophet said, \"I'm making this tabernacle a courthouse.\" [Applause] Hallelujah. He made his church a courthouse. And he says, \"I will start preaching warning and judgment.\" And after he preached warning and judgment, he preached, \"Now I already warned you. I indict you now.\" And after he preached indictment, he went around and preached trial, trial, trial, trial, trial. Five trials. And after he preached five trials, he put them in prison. Souls in prison. They in prison now can never get the Holy Ghost anymore. Why the judge is here? I just wanted to leave something behind. I save you from the prison. I pull the prison bars open. [Applause] Oh, then I preached the seven dimensions [Applause] and I preached Saturday is here. What happened Saturday? He went into the prison in the first dimension of hell and he preached in season and out of season. Out of season, Noah's day in his season, his day and they didn't repent. And after he preached, nobody got saved. It was the third pool. And then he went down to the third dimension of hell. And he rearranged Satan. Even his own devils didn't recognize him. He set captivity captive. He triumphed over the devil. He kicked the devil back into hell again. Saturday is here. Then that same Saturday, the blessed the saints under the sixth dimension. And it wasn't sixth dimension. It was paradise. heard him calking and talking to the thief that was on the cross next to him. And he told the thief, \"Don't worry. Watch these doors open.\" And he came to the doors. He said, \"Open up your [Applause] doors.\" And the angel says, \"Who are you?\" He says, \"I'm the Lord mighty in battle. I conquered hell. I conquered death. And I conquered the grave. [Music] Oh my. So, I'm nearly there. My brother, my sister, you can't put me to bed. You can't put me to bed. Because you can't feel my pain. You can put me to bed, but you'll never know my pain. Pain for 59 years in a message. All the different talks against me. Blessed is the man that when they speak all men of evil against him for my name's sake. You do not know my pain. You can put me to bed, but you don't know my pain. Oh my. I'm nearly closing. I can't get through the wall of these churches in the message. That's right. It's true. Hallelujah. Unless they open the door. But all the doors are closed. And they got the Holy Ghost outside. I can't get through their walls unless they open the door. Paul said, \"All have forsaken me.\" Brother Bram says, \"I'm alone.\" When you're a man of God, you are alone. Money is free. Everybody can get a dollar right up to a billion dollars. Money is free. But the Holy Ghost cost more than your natural bread. Simon the sorcerer wanted to buy the Holy Ghost. He didn't have enough money. Money is free, but the Holy Ghost costs more. Money is free, and the Holy Ghost is too far up the ceiling to reach. [Applause] [Music] Oh, the future head is already dead. Lord, it's already dead. because he's painted to a thread. The Pope is on his dying days. Trump is running wild around the world. Money is getting scarce. I'm trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus, King God. I'm trying to leave it behind. So you can go leave and say goodbye. But here I'll stay in El Tabernacle. I'm not going anywhere because I left something behind. You can lie to me with all those spoken word books that you don't love. Exactly. I can't follow you to the end of the world with all that false doctrines. Why not rightly dividing the word? Making the word of God to none effect. Mis consting the word. Misinterpreting the word. Dislocating the word. Add to the word seven thunders seven virtues add into the world subtracting from the word the Holy Ghost without emotions. I can't follow you till the end. My soul will be lost with all the spoken word books that you can't love. Amen. Amen. Oh, I'm nearing the end. Oh, I nearly forgot. I nearly forgot. I walk into the El Tabernacle church right into the sanctuary. I see a man that was blind once standing in front of the pulp. But now worshiping God. His eyes 2020. I'm just trying to leave something behind. right in the church now. Oh, I look and behold a man leaping and dancing right now in El Tabernacle. So crippled. So crippled that they had to carry him to the toilet. I see a couple man in Craig's door while we were dancing took his crutches and threw it away and started to dance. I just want to leave something behind. This couple man is right here now. Why? I just wanted to Leave something behind. I come into the church, the congregation and I witness three to five people raised from the dead. [Applause] I just wanted to leave something behind. I remember Ptoria as sister Lynette and her husband brought it back to my mind. We were having a meeting at George Martins. Knock on the door. Guy came and asked us to just please come over. His wife just died. The morttery was standing there waiting for him, for her. We went over and Raymond, you were there. Raymond Thompson, you were there. Raymond, Raymond, you were there and we went over and we form a circle around her and I prayed just a simple prayer and she was ice cold. The mortary already wrote out her debt certificate and after I prayed for her, she jumped up and said, \"Give me some [Applause] water. I just want to leave something [Applause] [Music] behind.\" Amen. [Applause] I just wanted to leave something behind. Amen. I behold in El Tabernacle now [Applause] a death and a dumb woman was a teacher at the deaf and dumb school. receive a healing, loose her tongue, and stop her ears before the whole congregation. And them all fainted. And there she is still alive today, yuring and talking. I just wanted to read something behind. [Music] Where's my other sister? That was death. Is she here? That was death. She is right in the church. Her ears is open in the church now. I was astonished in El Tabernacle now. A woman whose tubes was cut out and female parts damaged and the doctor says she will be barren all her life. Her husband's sperm bank couldn't make a half a child. God created human parts, raised sperm banks [Music] like in a third Paul manifestation and she gave birth to two children. There she is. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] Hallelujah. I lost count of how many women now in El Tabernacle that was barren that's having babies in their hands babies on the two sides. I even told her, you know, the whole plan wasn't given to them. Hallelujah. To multiply. Amen. Right now in El Tabernacle, wouldn't you like to be in a church like this? I just wanted to leave something behind. A elder in El Tabernacle had to have a heart transplant. You know about the testimony. He came to me. He was on his way to hospital. To have the operation on his heart. I prayed for him. When he got to the doctor says, \"Let's just check you again.\" And they checked his heart again. and they found out he's got a heart like a little child and he's still in E tabernacle. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Applause] I'm nearly closing. He had a heart like a baby. A preacher from Freandal. His mother came to the service in Cape Town, not belonging to the church. But she came and we prayed for her. She was barren. And I think the next month or so, she fell pregnant and she brought this boy forth who is a preacher now in our church. Can thou believe? Can thou believe? Then I just want to leave something behind. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Brother kid, brother Jerry's son, the elder was deranged. Had a deranged mind. They took him just about all over. Amen. Church to church, sang to Sangoma. [Music] Hallelujah. But he couldn't get his healing. I do not know who told him about El Tabernacle and they brought him to Eel Tabernacle and God whipped his mind. He's in his right mind now. Listen. Listen. He's in his right mind now. He even know how to make babies. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I just wanted to leave something behind. All these people is right here. By the grace of God. We had brother Grant Augustine's daughter's birthday the other day and the doctor says she will never make it. She's going to die. They're going to try and save the mother. And we prayed. Brother Grant [Music] gave the testimony and two weeks ago she turned 21. [Music] And you know what? She's now ready to make ground another opa because I just left something behind. What a church. What a church. Oh, God. [Music] We had a convention and the food ran out and there was just a little bit of food left and the queue was full very very long and they prayed The trust is prayed. And as they dish, the food got more. As they dished, the food got more. When they dished the last ditch, there was still food over. Like God multiplied the bread, he multiplied the food. I just want to leave. I just want to leave. something behind for you people. [Applause] I'm closing from Venda right up in the north near Zimbabwe. Amen. To the west, Cape Point. Right to the east, Durban. To the south of South Africa, over 10 churches and thousands and thousands and thousands of souls saved. I just wanted to leave something behind. From the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the token with emotions to the four parts of the word to the four aspects of the Holy Ghost to the son of man, the son of God, the son of David, the son of righteousness, back to the son of God again into the worship like John on the aisle of atmos when the book was open. Why are you worshiping? Because Revelations 10 is open and made plain and prophesied again. Healing accompanied all this. People raised from the dead. What is love? Explain. We explain what is love. The virtues came out of the Holy Ghost baptism. The guide says so. Corinthians 13 said so. Prophesying discernment on the back part of El Tabernacle. See all the prophecies there. Amen. The creation of the earth and the 70th jubilee in 1977. And give me a minstra. Let me dance. The evolution from the chimpanzeee to the serpent man to Adam to the real man, the son of man. Hallelujah. But for me, I enjoy preaching in El Tabernacle where the oil and wine is flowing. Not a painted fire because I left something behind. I just magnified my office when I said I left something behind. And what I like the most after all this, I like this very much. Praise him in the sanctuary. Now it doesn't matter which century. It could be Becket century, Ratif sanctuary, George Martin century. The Bible says praise him in the sanctuary. Why don't they praise him in the sanctuary? Psalm 100 says, \"When I come into the congregation, I'm praising him.\" Because you got to praise him in the sanctu. Praise him in the firminant of his power, the moon and the stars and the Milky Way. Amen. And the black holes and the Milky Way and the zodiac. Praise him for his great acts. Praise he the Lord. Praise him according to his excellent greatness. He's so great. He opened the Red Sea and he's got the power to close it, too. I just wanted to leave something behind. Praise him with a trumpet. Praise him with a trumpet. Praise him with a fluid. Praise him with a sexy phone. Praise ye the Lord. Praise him in the dance. Oh, I got to say that again because they don't can't even dance anymore. Let a old man show them how to dance, man. Praise him in the dance. Don't you want to praise him in the dance? Praise him in the dance. Praise him with the strings, instruments, and organs. Praise him upon the loud symbols. Praise him upon the high sounding symbols. Now here it comes. Let everything that has breath, oxygen, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Shouldn't put this here. Hallelujah. Everything that has breath. Praise ye the Lord. I don't care if it's a lion. Let the lion's roar be praise the Lord. He's got breath. I don't care if it's a coyote. Let his back be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's the bellow of a frog, let the frog bellow be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's the chipping of cricket, let the chipping of the cricket be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's the buzzing of a bunch of bees, a swarm of bees, let the buzzing be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's El Tabernacle, [Applause] Heat. Heat. If if there's anybody here, if there's anybody here that don't want to praise him, God will wake you up one morning and you'll hear the the the the birds singing and their singing will be to you. Praise ye the Lord. If there's anybody here that don't want to praise him, Jesus says the rocks will praise him. Look at the rocks praising him. Look at it. Why are we praising? Because full obedience to the word entitle you. Don't give it. It only entitles you. For the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. My Lord. So if you obey, then you'll dance. If you obey, you will shout. If you obey, you'll speak in tongues. If you obey, you'll clap your hands. If you obey, you will dance. If you obey, you will I want to say this is why I was born. To leave something behind. I left something out. I left something out. When he opened the Bible, God wrote in the beginning. God created the heavens and the earth. In the beginning, the better sheet. And a better when you take it from the right to the left spells out the crucifixion. The Bible open up with the crucifixion. In the beginning, there's the whole thing. It opens up with the crucifixion, the barit. And it closed in Revelations 5. Behold the lamb. Amen. Full of blood. It closes the Bible and opens the Bible. For this cause, I was born to leave something behind. God bless you. Thank you for my birthday. I wanted church on my birthday and you gave me church tonight because I'm leaving something behind. Happy birthday. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I say I know you well, but you can't lie to me with all those spoken words. You don't live. I'm trying to follow you to the end of the world. I'm trying to leave something behind. God bless you. Jesus God. Words have come from men. No Bible. Oh, but I can't help thinking that I heard the wrong cry. When the Holy Ghost is gone, my job will be the Holy Ghost is gone. My work is done. Trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus. [Music] Oh, money is free. Can't help it. If God has chosen some flesh to walk in, I got to exit to [Music] you because I had to [Music] leave something behind. Oh, the future ahead is broken in red. I'm trying to leave something behind in the footprints of [Music] Jesus. This whole world is a foreign land. We swallow the moon, but we walk on the moon, but we don't know. We got salvation in our hand. Oh, we're running the seven time. Oh, I'm trying to be Have you got something? Have you got something? [Applause] We are in the wrong mind and I cannot but I know I've been to his house but I'm trying to leave something [Music] behind Jesus Now there is a piece to my skin in my brain.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah Hall amen let us pray our heavenly father it is in the name of Jesus that we come to you this morning you know how we feel inside this morning Hallelujah and know God all that we want to be is messengers of you all that we want to be Lord is to send Souls into your kingdom all that we want to say and sing is I'll work till Jesus come I pray oh God that you give us more encouragement you said that you put your strength in them may you put strength in US Lord to fulfill our purpose on the earth I give this meeting into your hands Lord and I ask of you that you will draw strength out of it you that knows our motives and our objectives and you that try it and judge it Lord we can say that you know our motives and objectives may you bless the church as we try to help them we're not here to break them down we here to bold the Church of God [Applause] [Music] I can only do what you want me to do Lord what I'm SED for May you continually be with us through this meeting in jesus' name amen and amen praise God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Daniel Amen if you have your Bibles with you let's turn to the book of Hebrews the book of Hebrews that St Paul wrote because he was a Hebrew of Hebrews touching the Lord he was a Pharisee of Pharisees touching the the dispensation of Grace he was the first and foremost messenger of God touching the writings of the New Testament he wrote them all and everybody had to pattern after him because he says if an angel come from heaven and say anything contrary to what I I say let him be a [Music] curse Hebrews the book of Hebrews the 12th chapter reading the 16th and the 17th verse 16th and 17th verse L there be any fornicators a profane person as Esau who for one morcel of meat sold his birth right for you know how that afterwards after he sold out when he would have inherit the blessing he was supposed to inherit the blessing he was supposed to have been in the kingdom of God he was supposed to make it for heaven but he sold out gave it away didn't want it rejected it played around with it made a fool of it listen to what the word of God says inherited the blessing he was rejected even if he was supposed to have the blessing even if it was he was the son of a prophet even if he was in the lineage of many righteous man even if he was very religious he was rejected he was rejected for he found no place of repentance there was no place found for repentance it's all right no place found for repentance listen to the next line though he sought it carefully with tears carefully took his time went through his life line by line do by dot comma by comma as he took stock of his life and not only checking it but checking it with tears in his eyes maybe many a prayer went up at that moment of his distress and Gloom and being away from God and felt no touch from God anymore rejected it then what happened he cried he checked himself out he was still religious he still believed that his father was a prophet so believing brother Brenham is a prophet and it's your father if you do not live the life you go gone you gone God has no grandchildren the prophet says being in this message and think you are right and live any type of a life don't think that you are right seeking a place of repentance although we sought it carefully with tears cannot play with God God wants you to keep sincerity and fight on my son Jude preached not so long ago Don't Stop Don't Stop seeking it with tears many preachers think that when a man cries God will give him an opportunity to come back he didn't do it with Esau you cry while the grace of God is upon you then God wipes it away but when you cross the line you can cry until the cows come home you would don't listen to you let us bow our heads father what is scripture many and many Ministers of today Lord they'll be shaken when they see somebody cry at the altar like Esau but oh God once they cross that line nothing nothing nothing nothing will help them entering into the joys of the Lord I do pray that this morning Father that the efforts that's going to be put into this meeting Lord will be met after this meeting is over I do pray for the young people I do pray oh God that you'll speak to them I pray oh God that you would he would reveal to them the sincerity of this meeting I ask Lord that I cannot do anything unless you come you are the one that has called this meeting let results Blossom from the meeting father I give this meeting into your hands as I also after I went in and I saw this I was troubled in my soul lord I ask for grace and I ask Lord that I wouldn't play the fool with you that I would be sincere with the things of God H that I wouldn't shed tears when it's too late and the words will be UT uttered Lord too late too late too late for Tears answer prayer as I give this meeting into your hands Lord in jesus' name amen and amen you may be seated I greet everyone in the precious name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I I need your prayer to go through this meeting I feel tired I being at the funeral yesterday and uh would like to just B heads for the crossing over brother Samson and sister lyy and Coy i' would have Lov to be there but I'm just a human being I can't be all over I hardly have enough time for myself I do not know when last did I have a holiday I can't recall having a holiday I do not know when last so I ask you to pray for me I caught a little cold after preaching yesterday but I'm sure God will lead me through yet let us just bow our heads just for a little while for the two saints that has crossed over amen thank you want to thank God for their lives that was before us and the race is over as I said yesterday in mapani they had a dream many of us has dreams our dreams is actually what brings us to our purpose your dream is to be a millionaire that's fine politician that's fine we want our dreams to be on the Lord Jesus Christ if your dreams is on money if your dreams is on woman if your dreams is on the the world somebody will wake you up that great re Resurrection morning you'll be woken up but if your dream is on the Lord Jesus Christ then please don't wake me up I would like to Dream [Applause] On I've heard the other day that uh somebody said I preached on down the horizontal rainbow and uh that Mr Rosco uh doesn't care what he says when he's behind the poopit and speak about sex and stuff like that no I don't care and I don't apologize [Applause] [Music] if your pastor has a wishbone and cannot say those things then let him have a wishbone but I want to tell you I have a backbone and I'll say it again and again and [Applause] again I'd like to say that uh the young people years these things in school and you still want to speak about stalks bringing babies and stuff like that they know the hard facts and that's the reason I preach the hard facts I put it down without rubber gloves brother Brenham had to put it down and speak and it was bad in those times for saying those things that brother Brenham said when he spoke about the hum's underneath clothing is showing and it's a disgrace it was hard for him to say because nobody ever said it but we're living in another age that's worse than brother Bron's age this is worse and now I don't say that the humans underneath clothing is showing I said the penties are showing it's exactly what brother brandham says just brother BR couldn't say the way I say it because this is the age that needs the thing to be said [Applause] amen and if you not call Pastor to say it then don't say it you'll cause a lot of stumbling when you say it but when I say it it cause repentance wherever I preach that message fth came up and people [Applause] [Music] repented I preached that message down in Zimbabwe buo brother Beck walk up to me he says nobody can ever preach that the way you do cuz you have a gift to do it now if you don't have the gift to do it then shut up I'll do it for you years ago brother Coleman preached and in between his preaching he says there that woman sits with the split legs open and most of the ministers came down on him and I met him afterwards he says I do not know what's wrong with the ministers said God says he says uh do they read brother brandom and those guys didn't even know that was a quote can you imagine brother brandham how many years is ago brother Renee 30 some years that brother Rena spoke about a man stucking his fath in the woman and the woman is a a sexual garbage can 30 somewhat years ago and you want to play around Mister amen if you can't preach it get out of the poopet get somebody that will say it and preach it you know they they tried all the years to have something against me but every time they have something it actually boosts me [Music] [Applause] today I'm going to preach something that I think that ministers wouldn't like ministers would U would say how could he do a thing like this how could he show things like this in his church but again I would like to tell you that when I feel inspired of God then I do what God tells me and I'm going to go into things today that is mindboggling and I'm here to try and help my young people as I was told not long ago in the week and before that that somebody said you know there's a lot of virgins in Edgar Rosco's church so you don't have to tell me I know that because that's what I preach I tried to keep them clean and now even the world says he has a of Virgin sitting here so my young sister you think that nobody's watching you and you think that maybe you do not have a boyriend now they they they there's no eyes on you the eyes of the world is on you and they know who you are so keep yourself clean keep yourself clean don't let Devil's coming in and and and and wants to disrupt you and and the devil tells nobody's looking at you and that's why you don't have a boyfriend your boyfriend is on the way and when he's on the way he's going to appreciate you so much that you so you would like to be just around [Applause] you and it's funny uh that somebody phoned me I would not call her name phoned me and told me this but son Saturday after I preach I told my wife you know while I was preaching I looked around the congregation I saw so many virgins I said lovey I feel like fighting [Applause] on and may Lucifer know it may the hounds of Hell know it as long as I'm behind this Pulpit I'll preach Holiness like no man in the pipo ministry will preach it I will preach it with gloves of my hands rugged as rugged can be [Applause] and don't let anybody else tell you anything I am sent to help you I am sent to help [Applause] you and what I'm going to preach might not look so good to other people but it's good to me and they will say well how could brother Ros could do a thing like that but I would like to tell you that um brother Brenham one time was on the hunting trip and he walked and the angel of the Lord told him pick up that cigarette box and he said Lord I I never touch those things he says pick it up that's your message for Sunday a cigarette box and I want to tell you my brother and my pastor friend and preachers I'm picking up my cigarette box this morning and bringing out my message this morning Peter was told when he saw a vision of all the creeping things that the Jews was not supposed to eat and the voice told him eat kill and eat and he says I'm never at Haram before the angel told him listen you what I may don't call it haram slay and [Applause] eat so what I'm going to be busy with you do not call it by Any Other [Applause] Name just say that God showed him something that I never saw be honest once in your [Applause] life I must fulfill my purpose and I must come to make sense to the spoken word of William Brenan as he has [Applause] said in the spoken word that men will follow me in birth pains to make sense to the word and I must fulfill my purpose and so far I'm pleased I can see that I'm fulfilling my purpose what's in my heart I can see it's being fulfilled so I'd like to entitle this message crossing the line crossing the the line don't ever cross the line you'll feel religious you'll still feel that you're in the message you'll still go to church you'll still pray you'll weep you'll feel an anointing but it'll be on the outer cord but you have crossed the line God don't even listen to you crossing the line crossing the line means the place where something like a road a roadway or a Waterway or a line maybe crossed that's what crossing the line means lines get C gets drawn to determine borders that line is is is being drawn to show you this side is that country this side is this country anything that goes over that line is in trouble you are an alien when you come from this side and cross the line on the other side without papers you're an alien in that country God I mean the the the the governments of that country has all the right to put you into ceration and if they feel like throwing the key away they can because you cross the line crossing the line means that you're in somebody else's territory and you broke laws young people don't cross the line don't think that you can go on and on and on and God will just sit there and smile and say nothing and God will Pat you on your shoulder because he wants you to be saved God don't need you you need him could we have that first slide crossing the line normally you have a sign a skeleton or a skeleton's head and they said don't come into this terate and there's a skeleton's head there it means if you cross the line and there's a skeleton's head there then it means that you are going to become like a skeleton you are going to be severed apart you are going to be like the skeleton's head that's what a notice actually means and crossing the line could mean that your mortal life comes to an end crossing the line will make you a skeleton's head normally when they have a sign on the on the gate beware the dogs they have the same head there with a cross on there don't enter into this territory because he has vicious dogs here dogs that will ravage you dogs that will make you look like a skeleton dogs that's put there for one purpose is to protect the territory and everybody that passes the line that dog has the right to sever and tear him apart that's true crossing the line the logistics of that sign is don't cross that line into this territory you'll be SED apart I have visited most of the big waterfalls of the world most of them I visited all the big ones all the notable ones all the great waterfalls of the world I seen them all and brother and sister don't look at Rufus amen you watch me you look at that that that waterfalls falling and I seen them all over the world I visited them I saw Niagra Falls on the border of the states in Canada big water fall I saw the Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe the biggest I mean the deepest waterfall in the world and I saw the aasha waterfalls in Brazil the biggest of them all I saw all those waterfalls all over and on that waterfalls there is a line drawn and that line especially at Niagara Falls that line is called the line of no return it means if you cross that line there is no way back it means that when you have penetrated that line amen the current is so immense the drag is so uh so mighty that there is no way that you can come back because the current just pulls you and pulls you you can't swim back because you've crossed the line of no return there is no return when you cross that line and that current just takes you into the cataracts below and brother Bram says in pmma Vision Jeffersonville Indiana 1969 what it will be to know that you set in meetings and heard that you you should get right with God uh and I hope that this meeting is a meeting like this that you will get right with God uh amen and receive the Holy Ghost and a and a defying soul to hear that voice speak out in that meeting that you set in and heard the judgments of God preach and refuse it the Great Falls that's just below you the great cataracts that'll take you to your Eternal Doom way down in that cataracts that's when you come down the waterfall and you fall into that cataracts below amen he types it with eternal damnation when you cross the line of no return uh and the drag takes you uh and the current takes you and it throws you right down in the cataracts below and what happens when you hit the cataracts below it takes your soul right down in condemnation and eternal Doom he says voices of many Waters forth patronage of him voice of many Waters how you going to do it when it's recorded in glory when The Voice tonight is recorded uh when The Voice this morning is recorded your voice is recorded your thoughts are recorded as a man think it in his heart so is he notice your voice is louder in heaven than your uh I mean your thoughts is louder in heaven than your voice is on the earth certainly it is God knows the thoughts intense of heart he knows all about it don't cross the line into the currents of hell then not even my preaching will be able to save you and not even the Holy Ghost in L Tabernacle as it moveed from bench to bench will ever save you because you're heading down for the cataracts below where it takes your soul into Eternal damnation when you hear the voice of many Waters is a voice of many gods and Men of God that has the voice of almighty God when you hear that voice voice is hard and not your heart El Tabernacle amen never never before amen did you hear the voice of God so vividly declared to you as this church has heard it amen and I want to tell you don't cross this voice uh don't go over onto the other side in this voice amen you rather fulfill this voice uh and don't cross the line [Applause] down at the cataracts below as your soul gets dragged to Hell somebody says yes brother Ros shouldn't we be more positive and preach I preach positive most of my messages is positive but you cannot only uh preach positive you have to have a negative and a positive to let the light go on amen there's make Believers and unbelievers and Believers in the church you have to preach to them all uh amen there sers that needs repentance uh and you need to show them if you cross that line uh it's a line of no return uh and brother there's a line drawn for every blood watch child of the Living God uh there's a line drawn a bloodline a Jesus line a token line and brother I want to welcome you to cross that that line and you'll never return Hallelujah to the things of the world you'll be saved saved and saved uh yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sir the prophet crossed a line one time where a a man just the day before crossed that line and Abu came and slaughtered the man because he crossed the line he went into a territory that he was not supposed to have gone in and do you know I don't read nowhere that brother Brenham says that the authorities of the SPCA came and killed that bull no he penetrated the Bull's territory and he knew the consequences when you cross the line you know the consequences you know what's heading your way you know which way you're going and God has no apologies then you have to face the [Applause] music crossing the line and the next day brother Brenham didn't mean anything and he crossed the line and then that guy made himself ready for his second convict him but love saved him hallah love dropped out and love spoke to the bull and laugh told the bull listen here I was on my way to a certain brother to to to pray for him because the god that made you made me look how brother Brenham spoke to that murderous Bull and that bull just looked at brother Brenham and that bull deciphered what brother Brandon was saying and that bull says oh you're going to pray for a certain brother so you're loving for others okay go your way when you love for others even Bulls St come near you amen that's eternal life [Applause] thank you brother Rufus amen crossing the line you can't come back when you cross the line whether you cross the line of the blood of Jesus Christ you go so deep in that blood then you even sing the song no turning back no turning back amen you can't can't go back anymore because you have crossed the line into holy territory you would never want to come into the land of sin no more you're living in a Land of peace peace a wonderful peace uh coming down from the Savior above amen hallelujah amen God also has a line of no return and that's the blood of Jesus Christ don't let us cross that line young people this meeting is for you this morning amen don't cross that line of No Return by blaspheming the Holy Ghost is a line of no return rejecting the manifestation of the word to love the word is a line of no return uh turn your head and heart away from God uh then God turns his mind and heart away from you it's a line of no return amen put something between you and God Amen and make an idol of it that's the line of no return uh close your of compassion towards all that's called God Amen that's the line of no return you keep on sinning freely amen you War but you go on H that's the line of no return God won't give you another chance amen as long as eternity Rings Amen in this Dreadful thing this is what happens when you cross the line I wish I could let all you read it because because I've got a lot to say I'll just quote it uh Proverbs 1:24 because I have called and he refused I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but you have set at not all my counsels and who do and who none of my reprove I will also laugh your Calamity I will mock when your fear cometh when your fear cometh as destruction and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you then shall they call upon me but I will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me help us Lord when I called you you didn't want to come when I stretch my hand out to you I want to save you you refuse my head now when your Destruction come when you start to seek me with tears like Esau I had my hand out for Esau amen I tried my best for Esau but he turned my hand down he looked at a mortal little morcel of food and he rejected my amazing hand my hand of Grace he rejected it and now he rejected my hand of Grace I will reject him too he will seek me amen at the altar he will cry at the altar he'll call upon my name at the altar you'll say Lord where are you and I will turn my back against you because you didn't want to come when I called you now that you call me you won't find me why cuz you crossed the line you mean Esau born in the message yes you mean Esau with such a spiritual mother a Praying Mother yes you mean Esau that knew the Torah the spoken word for his day yes I reject him I reject him and when he calls I will not answer him why do Esau cross the line of no return brother brandham says when he was in hell he cried for God and the was was no God he prayed and he he repented but there was no God what was God showing him showing him that thus is the line of no return you my Prophet going tell them never to come to this place never never never never never come to this place cuz when you cross the line now you see the place now you want to turn back to the right place but the devil cannot leave you he says in Isaiah I am the one that do not open my prison doors there is no way of an escape crossing the line young people don't play around with god oh many and many didn't understand when I said you young boys that goes out and do whatever you want to do set it home why because I don't want your children to cross the line don't want them to sit you and go on and go on and go on and go on until they cannot come back anymore let them sit at home and reason it out is this better than hell is the church better than belir they have to decide but as for me in my house we'll serve the Lord when they call me I would not come I will laugh at that imagine God laughing imagine you hurt him so much that he feels so distressed that he laughs at you at your day of Calamity I told you some time ago that people wouldn't come on a Wednesday night to the meeting and afterwards they'll come maybe they stay out of this meeting one Wednesday the next Wednesday they in the meeting two Wednesdays they skip the third meeting they are there and not long they start on Sundays they don't come to Sundays I want to tell you beware that you do not cross the line and you're going to cry to be here and you'll cry and feel the Holy Ghost but God has rejected you you do not play around with God play around with your mother play around with your father play around with your friends but don't play around with the word of God God will God will thus sayth the Lord cut you [Applause] off cross the line of no return there's no way back and now I want to show you a striking thing young people I want to show you a striking thing this will happen to many of the young people that don't listen to this voice and the voices of that fivefold Ministry this is what's going to happen you go after this you want this this is the end thing amen I want this because my friends got it amen and because the whole the whole schools got it I feel like like an outcast you rather be an outcast but an incast in heaven outcast on the earth I want to be I do not want to be conformed to the things of the world I want to be right with almighty [Applause] God and now for the young people let us go Daniel you know of Elvis wle as the artist proclaim the king of rock and roll but what you're about to see is the side of this legendary singer which is on virtually unexplored join me as we discover generous spiritual man as revealed by those who knew him well and knew well his love of gospel music [Music] amaz in all likelihood gospel was the first music that Elvis heard the surviving child of twins born to Vernon and Gladis Presley Elvis entered the world in Humble circumstances he never laed for Love from his father he learned the value of heart Elvis Presley a twin Elvis Presley born with a brother Elvis Presley a gospel singer Elvis Presley a singer with talent but a twin what do you mean by TS Pastor Roso Cain and Abel Abel died Cain lived Elva's brother died and he lived twins what twins Pastor Rosco Jacob and Esau twins one evil one good one in the church Elvis Presley singing he touched me when did God touch Folk when did God ever work with f and young people would go after theck and R Kings and sell their births to them they would connect up with a man's name that's called Evil Al ver take the the L out behind the E and put it at the back it's evil and he sang a song I'm evil I'm evil and all that our young people see is to go with a mob and follow this monster I pull no punches and it's here where you lose your virgins the Devil comes in with music and he steals the virgins the Devil comes in with music and he prings the drugs and the cigarettes and the nice time and all that the young people do is to follow it but let us go on T Cain and AEL his mother to whom he was intensely devoted he gained a foundation of faith and a love for gospel music okay Daniel gospel music he loves singing gospel music a devil well I thought that the devil is Antichrist no the Bible says the devil believes even he sings great Musical songs doesn't mean that the man is saved it doesn't mean that the man is right with God uh it doesn't mean that he comes from Heaven uh no in a million miles no and you young people you go after things like this I don't want to follow him I already made up my mind I'll follow Jesus all the [Applause] way his mother gave him the gospel mother Pentecostal hold it Elvis Presley being baptized baptized in a Pentecostal Church baptized and be called a brother baptized as a child of God and yet he was the Devil Himself how could would I let my children go after men like that and act like them and dress like them and go with them and go to the session halls with things like that I will keep them away they say brother Rosco is il legalist yes you believe it sir I'll be a legalist as long as they don't get that into the church [Applause] don't think that you are baptized you are right don't think that that man that comes into the church and gets baptized he's a [Applause] saint he's so full of the devil Let It Roll Daniel [Music] when did he receive the Holy Ghost stop it did we receive the Holy Ghost we'll see further on he could go right up till the baptism but he could never get the baptism in the Holy Spirit you can receive the word anybody can receive the word anybody can receive the word and be baptized and he never questioned one time the word he even read the word we're going to see later on he read the word but the question was the baptism in the spirit of God brother brandham types him I've got the quotes as Judas scariot and Judas was in the word Judas slept with the prophet Judas was in the message don't tell me you're in the message man it means nothing to the devil the only thing that matters to the devil is when you got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost leads you to the word and the word leads you into the light and the life leads you into shouting and jumping and dancing and shoing and dancing lead you into crying and sighing for the Abomination that's done in the city then the devil shakes [Applause] Let It [Music] Roll he long to be there you long to be there Bright sh they gets baptized not sprinkled we baptized the devil will even baptize himself but not the Holy Ghost [Music] baptism in the soul [Music] real this relationship with his mom was very special he was extremely close to her he was not as close to Vernon his father by any by any means as he was his mother but his mother you know okay his mother a Pentecostal woman his mother took him to a Pentecostal Church his mother a Praying Woman his mother set the pattern for him to never go lost young people El's mother was spiritual your mother is spiritual and don't think that your mother and father is spiritual and they're living the life with Jesus Christ that you're going to be all right and do whatever you want to you'll see what brother Brandon says about this guy I'm only starting we're going to get out here late he extremely close to her he was not as close to Vernon his father as by any by any means as he was his mother but his mother you know she held his hand and took him to church and took him to school walked him to school when he was a child those things he never was always there for him when he needed her it's just something he never forgot and you know he just he never got over her death [Music] I got into conversation with Elvis just it's just a regular General conversation how are you doing I'm doing fine and you and how you hurt from home this kind of thing but he said uh uh you know my mama went to the uh there in Memphis he said went to a Pentecostal Church down there and uh he said went at Pentecostal church he said are you Pentecostal I said well I've attended a Pentecostal Church quite a bit and uh but I said uh I don't you know I've just I've been kind of Baptist Baptist Churches also and uh he said well said uh I tell you what's on my mind he said this Holy Spirit thing you know anything about the Holy Spirit thing I said what you talking about I mean he was just kind of been he was just being Elvis cuz Elvis was so plain he just went straight to the juggler you know straight to the point and he began to talk about he never felt worthy of this Christian or this type of religion his mother had taught him in the church he never felt worthy of the Pentecostal blessing Judas could never get it Elvis couldn't get it he didn't say well I never he says I didn't feel worthy of it young people wake up this is where all the filth started this is the father of all the other rock stars and pop stars it's the father and the father wanted to know about the Holy Ghost I wanted to know how do I know that I've got it and if he you following him and you don't even know what was in the man's heart the man's heart wanted God the man's heart wanted to be a Christian the man's heart wanted to be near God but he crossed the line and God didn't answer him that's why he says I never felt withy made Shak in L Tabernacle this morning Let It Go felt worthy of this Christian or this type of religion his mother had taught him him in the church don't play with the sound just leave it he said how will I get how will I know if I get the Holy Spirit or I have the Holy how do I know and how do I get it does holy ghost thing and he never got it oh elvers elvers if you only knew that was in the ease of man on the earth now that can give you the Holy Ghost that's got connection as brother Brandon says there is man that can give you and lead you into the Holy Ghost I might not be able to give you but I can lead you into [Applause] it and there was a man William brandham that could lead him into it but he wanted to listen to other men that William brandham was the hand of God to draw him away from the line of no r how do I know how do I know I've got it how do I get it and here you said Al Tabernacle you young people your Elvis Presley didn't have the Holy Ghost your Elvis Presley wanted to know how to get it your Elvis Presley that you get mad all want to just one more chance and get the Holy Ghost and yet he doesn't have it and here you sit in the church where the holy spirit is and where you can be saved where you'll never cross the line why don't you listen to this [Applause] preacher how will I get how will I know if I get the Holy Spirit or I have the Holy Spirit of God in Me and uh so I I don't quite know that uh this Baptist preacher don't even know how to get it too and some ministers in this message want to be Baptist they even turn around and says I would rather be a Baptist than a Pentecostal you don't even know what you're talking about sir you are actually saying that you want to be caring the only Eagles that there is is Eagles that's got the holy ghost that knows where to fly don't you know that I don't want to be a Baptist Hallelujah but I want to have the Pentecostal experience amen how would I know if I get the Holy Spirit or I have the Holy Spirit of God in Me and uh so was I I don't quite know that uh I said God has promised us everything and as long as we're faithful to him he'll give us everything we're supposed to have and when we get it we'll know it when we we have what we're supposed to have we'll know it I said I think that's Infinity you're talking about Infinity he said Infinity you're talking if you talk about the Holy Ghost you're talking about Infinity Elvis knew more than a lot of bunch of ministers in this message that has rejected the Holy Ghost because of jumping and shouting if you don't jump and Shout you don't have it sir and I pull no punches that's one of the aspects of the Holy Ghost we have what we're supposed to have we'll know it I said I think that's Infinity you're talking about Infinity he said well I just want is God when you have the Holy Ghost you have God God in you Hallelujah the word and the spirit is God himself not the word the spirit and the word Let It Roll brother so I think that's Infinity you're talking about Infinity he said well I just want my what my mama had my mama had something real good so I kind of thought that was up my mama had something real good we you hear what brother brandham says about his mom all ministers in this message are you going to cross the line for you can never return to the Holy Ghost again oh I don't want the Holy Ghost that's Edgar Rosco's thing that is nothing to do with Edgar Rosco that's Infinity that's God hallelujah and it's for everybody I just want my my mama had my mama had something real good so I I thought that was a a a simple maybe a simple statement from him but a very deep one because he he was trying to get into this thing of he wanted everything it was a deep one not the word everybody knows the Bible but the Holy Ghost is a deep thing amen that even the type of Judas es scariot Elvis Presley knew that the Holy Ghost is a deep thing amen I've dug deep and I've drank strange Waters uh a simple maybe a simple statement from him but a very deep one because he he was trying to get into this thing of he wanted everything he could from God he really loved God he would discuss spiritual ideas with us and it wasn't so much uh what we did it was what happened in the room the at the atmosphere how it changed from one setting to this unbelievable setting with Coach chills with on your arm you know and and I I kind of they would sing with Elvis Presley at the backstage after he sang rock and roll and these guys would go you'll see them later on and you're going to have the have a question mark to listen to the music and uh while they were singing with Elvis at the back of the stage they could feel the Holy Ghost on their flesh as goose pimples comes I don't deny that but it's not on the right place it's on the flesh to this unbelievable setting with Co chills on your arm you know and and I I use the soul that in in my analogy of the Hol the Holy Spirit sort of came in there and it sort of dwelt Among Us and and we really begin to uh watch what he says the Holy Ghost dwelt amongst them the Holy Ghost don't give up until you cross the line says he dwelt amidst us but he didn't dwell in US young people I hope to shake you this morning I hope so and remember ministers this is for my church for my young people and this is the way God wants me to show them it's not worth it when the very stars that they fall follow is fallen stars and these fallen stars one's God go on brother you know and and I I kind of use that in in my analogy of the ho the Holy Spirit sort of came in there and it's sort of dwelt Among Us and and we really begin to uh live the words instead of singing the words it kind of came in there and saturated us made us all equal I think that's that's the thing that equals us all out because when El started singing you knew he meant what he what he was singing you know he he meant those words almost every time Elvis would sing How Great Thou Art he had a special feeling I mean sometimes you can pretend that you have an emotion in a song almost every time you sang that song you could feel the spirit of him because that was his actual praying prise to God he really believed every word in that song he knew how great God is I believe that he got more joy out of singing that song and I think you can tell when you see the video and when you hear it this this is this is the soul of Elvis when he sings that song oh Lord my God listen to that gift without [Music] repentance Wonder consider all the words I has have [Music] me I see Star I hear The Rolling Thunder I power throughout the you display sing it fellas Christ take me what Jo shall my then I shall bow in Humble ad adoration and their Proclaim oh my God how great the world then think my thought sa God to the how great so are how great th [Music] are and sing My Soul Our Savior God who the how great the Lord how great [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh you ever heard a gift like that you see the anointing behind it but that anointing is not calling anybody to Heaven it's calling everybody to Hell the devil sends his messenger with an anointing the people gets out of their mind when they hear him sing because gifts and callings is without [Music] [Applause] repentance and oh my God who was singing the background bul Gators group he just sang rock and roll now he just sang the the the the PS of hell now and people and woman would take out their penties and throw it uh amen and men will run naked around and people will faint uh amen because of the gift that that the devil gave him and the anointing the devil gave him and then he comes at the end of the coner How Great Thou Art then it feels for God he done the devil's Duty now he still wants an opportunity with God you cannot have God and have the devil at the same time out of one Fountain runs no two waters it's only one water and it's a clean water yes yes yes you say you say my but brother Rosco he sing gospel me brother I don't care if he sings gospel me he's still a devil why because Judas was also in the church and the Bible says they sang hymns and he also sang the hymns now you people that think the devil is Antichrist now you have learned something that the devil is religious Mah doesn't mean that he's right with God if he hasn't got uh if he hasn't got uh the qualities uh amen of a minister of God uh then you run away from him you better get away from [Applause] [Music] [Applause] him the sure rocked many soul he sure rocked The Souls of black and white and blue and pink and whatever he rocked all their souls but now they're rolling in hell that's all that rock and roll brings and pop this is the top guy right on top young people right top okay elv who was his friend bu Gator who is this is that one of bulat's boys could men like this go behind Elvis Pressley Rock and Roll Show and sing with Elvis's gospel they were caught up in the same thing I'm coming to this made Rocky also young people made rock your soul behold your God behold your God you go out on drugs and drinking and smoking and whoring and all that behold your God the devil's own messenger elv us went to Sunday school I don't care if you went to Sunday school let go on Daniel I'll just ch from here it was a church called East trig Baptist Church Reverend Herbert Brewster was the pastor great gentleman and a great gospel songwriter I gave the music a different approach a new beat I knew that it wasn't going to hurt if I said much Jesus boss alone whether I've said with one beat two beat whether I've said it high low and I told him come on in here and and put your stuff together they came in here and it was a glorious experience and Elvis was in that group they had a glorious experience and Elvis was in the group Elvis learned the gospel amen that old negro gospel songs from this preacher right in the church and you your mom and dad is in the church and you come along and you think you're right here has Elvis also been in the church but the devil okay my brother came in here and it was a glorious experience and Elvis was in that group growing up in a Pentecostal church he had seen God work powerfully and he threw himself into his faith as passionately as his music we according to Elvis inspired him to sing and inspired him to sing the way he sings that he got his U he got his the blackhood brothers inspired Elvis we Al Mana better be very care for what we see you musicians you better wake up you know why Elvis could sing like that because him and his father was one his father was a good singer the Bible says he was a chorus leader well God send me to make sense this was never made sense to and I don't care what you think about me ministers in the message this is made sense to okay we according to Elvis inspired him to sing and inspired him to sing the way he sings that he got his uh he got his expressions and his uh way of singing from the Statesman quartet and the Blackwood Brothers those were the two dominant groups during that era when Elvis was coming up and they had the greatest influence is that all the the the the video of these guys Idol and singing B singer the Statesman they call him the big Che I'll this of my house kind of after the Big Chief but I didn't know but I know now I'm just glad that to have had a part in his early upbringing and his inspiration to [Music] sing Luc stands next to Elis the greatest bus [Music] singer you know him or just open my eyes that I may see Lead Me Oh [Music] Lord I am tired and I need I string and to guide me [Music] over or just open my eyes that I may sing me that's right [Music] me you Elvis Love B singing there was a sing done at the do you know that [Music] man you hear El was sing and surely what the man said you can feel the the the P amen of a man that's seeking for God and that just shows you what the word of God says esos SE after singing rock and roll and after sending millions of souls to hell he'll come back and he would like to be in contact with God what was he doing he was seeking for salvation and he didn't find it you young people you're never going to be the same after [Applause] this Elvis Love B singing there was a sing down at the Lis Auditorium which was two blocks from where he lived in the housing project he was always at the Saints and then one month he missed and the next month he came back I said Son where were you last month why didn't you come he said I didn't have enough money to buy a ticket I said well you won't need any money from now on I just come to the stage door I let you in for nothing and that's the way it remained until about the next thing I knew he was letting me in his stage door cuz I didn't have the money though he sang of his faith with conviction Elvis was troubled by questions that seemed to have he had questions and now you know what these questions was how can I be saved and it says it was never answered he died with a question I wonder if I've got the Holy Ghost I wonder if I'm right with God he had tears in his eyes young people tears looking for God looking for the way back and I'm so glad in this 20th century how mean in this Century that we're living in that there is a way to God uh there is a Divine approach amen and I'm not ashamed to say itth the spoken word amen the Holy Ghost and the spoken word with preaching under the anointing takes you back to God again [Applause] life loved though he sang of his faith with conviction Elvis was troubled by questions that seemed to have no answers when the storm exactly at that time when he couldn't have an answer the answer was walking around in Jeffersonville on two feet but that's not what he wanted he wanted an answer that he could still be the rock King but this answer on 2 in Jeffersonville said you are Judas and he didn't win that that was God's answer okay let it go he sang of his faith with conviction Elvis was troubled by questions that seem to have no answers no answers when the storms of life are raging stand by there was nobody to stand with him when the storms was raging when the storms of life are raging stand by in your day of Calamity I will love at you your days of storm when the world is tosing me like a ship out on the sea thou who rulest when what stand by I think that Elvis thought that he'd wake up and find that it was all over with you know it was just it was just a dream when I'm gr and when he woke up it was not only a deem a reality according to the prophet of the hour he'll tell you where Elvis woke up oh here's a quote here brother Bram says Alvis will walk up to the judgment and all his records will be plain for him as he walks up to the judgment oh I wish but I walk up to the throne of God that all my messages will be bluring out in front of my God and I tried my best I tried my best I tried my best young people I'm trying my best [Applause] he'd wake up and found that it was all over with you know it just it was just a dream when I'm growing old you didn't grow old [Music] and when I'm growing though his most Ardent fans felt he could do no wrong Elvis was well aware of his shortcomings and grew increasingly uncomfortable with the agulation lavished upon [Music] him look at this he frequently read the Bible and often prayed with those around him one you read the word from now onward ministers don't tell me about the word the word the word tell me about the Holy Ghost that leads you to the word then I'll start listening to you Elvis also read the word Judas also read the [Applause] word he frequently read the Bible and often prayed with those around him one notable example was the evening he learned that Sylvia shenell a member of his background group the Sweet Inspirations received news that she had been diagnosed with cancer we got to Vegas and as we he prayed he touched Sylvia's stomach and he asked God to move whatever it was just take it away and the next morning when syvia reported to Sunrise Hospital there in Las Vegas they did the test and it was gone whatever it was whether it was a misdiagnosis or whether God had healed Sylvia through Elvis's faith and our faith I don't know but we believed and Elvis believed also that God had worked a miracle through him he would discuss Elvis read the word Elvis prayed and Elvis had a Healing Ministry but the holy ghost thing he admitted that he hasn't got it okay faith and our faith I don't know but we believed and all us believed also that God had worked a miracle from him he would discuss spiritual ideas with us and I remember that we were standing in a circle one night and this was in Vegas and he said I want you all to close your eyes he said we're going to we weren't going to pray but he just said I want you to close your eyes and I was thinking in my mind I'll never forget this I was going to say Elvis what do you think about heaven I was going to ask him what he thought about heaven and I had my eyes closed and he said Jim we're going to get to that just a moment and I open my eyes and he and I said to what he said you were going to ask me about heaven weren't you and I said yeah he even had discernment and you people in the message says well brother OS who's got discernment he's a prophet no Elvis also had it and you must have it each individual must have [Music] discernment that's thus sayth the Lord because brother Bron said it in discernment of spirits and Discerning the Lord's body okay my brother discuss spiritual ideas with us and I remember that we were standing in a circle one [Music] night and this was in Vegas and he said I want you all to close your eyes he said we're going to we weren't going to pray but he just said I want you to close your eyes and I was thinking in my mind I'll never forget this I was going to say Elvis what do you think about heaven I was going to ask him what he thought about heaven and I had my eyes closed and he said Jim we're going to get to that just a moment and I opened my eyes and he and I said to what he said you were going to ask me about heaven weren't you and I said yeah he said we'll get that in just a minute that blew me away I don't know how how that happened Elvis is very spiritual he uh believed that he had a certain connection with God not so much more than anybody else listen closely because when I come up to the quotes it's all that brother brandham saw even before she spoke about this and then you'll believe there's a prophet in the land and the apostolic gift will amen that Prophet around every day okay brother Elvis was very spiritual he uh believed that he had a certain connection with God not so much more than anybody else did but in his search he was trying to get close to God so in his search and Judas what did Judas do for repentance he tried his utmost place to get repentance he was searching for God and he yet religious there's no way you can find god brother briam says God works through a Ministry only way God works there's where you'll finding okay brother with God not so much more than anybody else did but in his search he was trying to get close to God so he felt that by helping others maybe that was his Elvis had even the revelation of others God made me preach before we got this [Applause] video but in his search he was trying to get close to God so he felt that by helping others maybe that was his mission and I remember just looking at him and I said man you are really really blessed and I said you know as great as this album is and all the success you have I said you know God is the one who made all this possible I said God has placed you in a unique situation and I said you know you are really blessed and he turned to me and he said you know I know that huh and I know that I couldn't have done it without God and that just keep that one also in mind you'll hear what brother brandham says okay brother and all this possible I said God has placed you in a unique situation and I said you know you are really blessed and he turned to me and he said you know I know that and I know that I couldn't have done it without God and that just you know a lot of people think that he was insensitive to it but he realized that everything that came to him came from God and he and he cherished it that that way his friends noted that Elvis was often confused about why God had allowed him such success in a clan yet he never questioned that his gifts were from God perhaps that's why the song He Touched Me was particularly meaningful to his the hand of Jesus touched me and now I am no I'm not here today to make him an angel I'm not here to make him a saint and I'm just telling you the truth and how he was and he but I read believe this whole deep this deep Foundation that his mother had these deep roots in the church uh gave Ela something to shoot for maybe something happen and now I know he touch [Music] me concert he just called us out to do it in the concert nobody knew nothing about it none of us knew we going to do it at all it just sort of an impromptu thing but I think it was it really put us kind of put us on the map so to speak I mean it kind of put us after the concer where people knew who we were ladies and gentlemen if you would I would like to ask the stamps if they would sing a song that they do by themselves it's a beautiful song called sweet sweet spirit and I don't sing in this just listen to them please I am not singing yes Sweet Holy Spirit I'm not singing this cuz I'm not a part of that catch it watch it ladies and gentlemen if you would I would like to ask the stamps if they would sing a song that they do by themselves it's a beautiful song called sweet sweet spirit and I don't sing in this just listen to them please a sweet sweet spirit in this and I know that is the of the Lord there are [Music] sweet for each look at the [Music] tears that look at the [Music] tears Sweet [Music] Holy sweet St up their [Music] tears to too late too late blessing [Music] we without a doubt know that we have been when [Music] [Music] we look at that tears running down his cheeks that's why I read that scripture about Esau here they singing the greatest thing that could happen to humanity the Holy Spirit and yeah Elva says I cannot join with them I cannot sing with them I cannot I cannot connect with them in the song because I I can't reach this Holy Ghost but let them sing it and you'll know this is the thing that I'm short I know the word I read the word every day as we hear them say it amen I have have gifts of healing and I I have discernment and and I do pray but I this one thing the holy ghost thing I don't have and I can't join with them in singing and while they singing eso's tears is running and God is not answering young people your Elvis Presley that you want to follow the school friends wor this is how he felt and you sit right in a church where you can have a thing that Elvis will never never never never never never never never never never never never never never get and you that's got it keep it with two hands [Applause] though he sang of his faith with conviction Elvis was troubled by questions that seemed to have no answers listen to the song there must be lights burning brighter somewhere there wasn't Jeff be birds flying higher in a sky Eagles in Jeffers If I Can Dream of a better land where all my brothers walk in there was somebody that was in at land oh why oh why can't my dream come true his dream never come true oh why there must be peace and understanding sometimes strong wind of promise that will throw away all the doubt and fear If I Can Dream of a warmer Sun where hope keeps shining on every be one tell me why oh why oh why want that son son never appeared to you Jesus Christ we're lost in a cloud with too much rain we're trapped in a world that trouble with pain but as long as the man has the spr to dream he can redeem his soul and life there's a vision where there is no vision the people die my question still I am sure that the answer answer is going to come somehow out there in the dark a CLE oh yeah and why I can see while I can walk while I can stand while I can talk while I Can Dream leave let my dream come true right now let oh [Applause] [Music] yeah why doesn't my dream come true deep in my heart there's a dream somewhere The Sun Shines brighter yes Elvis just on the other side of in Jefferson Bol the sun deep sign because it is the rising of the sun somewhere the Birds flies higher yes Elvis just on the other side in Jefferson B there's a bird called an eagle a prophet that fly higher someone had a dream yes Elvis just there in Jefferson B there's a prophet that had a dream a vision that showed us on the other side of Heaven why didn't your dream come true because you made yourself an agent of Lucifer and you reject it God you backslid you went to the world and you left God you crossed the line and right at the end of your ministry Elvis you're saying why don't my dream come true every dream that's not based on eternal life will will never come true but I believe that my dream that's in my heart that there will be people in Al Tabernacle that's going to make it I know that you're shaken I was so shaken when I looked at this video I was not myself for weeks my brother Morgan asked me to take the funeral they will tell you how I preached I felt if Elvis could give his all for the devil what's wrong with that garage at the beginning Elvis couldn't see anything wrong with his rock and roll it was so nice it was so pleasant in the beginning when the friends comes around you young person amen and they they introduce you to Dr into cigarettes it looks so nice but you cannot see the wrong that's in it and what it's going to do for you he couldn't see that the devil was interlaced in his lyrics oh Alvis he couldn't see hell's arms was open like never before to take the young people to hell in his songs he couldn't see that Fallen Angels was anointing him and the crowds as they sweep through the minds of the young people by his music the 60s started off with a gutter of folk the 60s actually spurned off every vile thing that's on the earth now the 60s amen brought in the to be a virgin is out of fashion serving God is oh Mur going to church is outdated going on a trip through the drugs and and and and and have a long trip with drugs that's the in thing I would rather have that dream alvers a dream of drugs a dream that takes you on a trap uh that's what the young people want uh but I want to tell you amen I have a dream too and I have a vision too and my vision is a shout and a voice and a trumpet and I'll be changed uh in a moment in that twinkling an eye and the lost Trump and the Trump of [Applause] God the 60s brought in to the young people to love past Die Young and make a goodlooking corpse make a nice corpse but what lays behind that corpse is hell you're not nice there because the word of almighty God says there is nashing and weeping of tears after the corpse so I don't want to be a nice corpse I want to be a nice Christian in the six Dimension before God gives me the seventh [Music] Elvis was the blanket listen here the 60s brought in this gut of fult the devil was gone countering God what was the devil doing when he sent Elvis Presley he was countering God because right there in the 60s the greatest thing that ever happened outside of Calvary happened 196 three when seven angels came down from glory and they brought the book of redemption the Seven Seals amen what did the devil do he wanted to throw a blanket over that thing so that his colleagues couldn't see Redemption power but see him as the king of rock and roll he watered down God having a prophet because he wanted to be hell's King he watered down by singing The Great shalom shalom shalom good morning bride he threw that over and watered it down in the 60s oh God he took the sting of 1963 out from his people the demonic people take the sting out just in case they will come and get saved amen the devil says Okay God you have a prophet you have a holy prophet I will send my property and his name will be Elvis don't you call your child Elvis hell opened wider in the 60s Amen to accept the millions and the millions and the millions and the millions that Elvis freshly pushed into hell even up till now they that lived in the 1960s you look at them they still have earrings on and long hair it goes every musical thing that comes on the earth goes with hairstyles Hallelujah [Applause] and the hell brought on itself to receive the messages Elvis put them into hell and I'm going to read the quote for you and you ministers that don't understand Edgar Rosco why don't you just leave me alone I'm called higher than you when I said uh give me your soul I knew what I was saying [Applause] I am called higher than you whether you like it or whether you don't I am 60 years old and I know if I do not know by now I will never know [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hell open wide in the 60s and I want to tell you he took the millions and the millions uh amen but have it open to receive the minute group uh that will believe that God send the message with the Holy Spirit and with angels and Heaven also open their arms uh to everyone that believe this message of the day the Dynamics and and the mechanics together that's the message of the hour no other message Hallelujah I had a dream and my dream will come [Applause] true and after Elvis prly many will follow and be his ministers after he goes there will be many that will follow him to keep the fire of Hell Ablaze Ministers of Elvis Presley and after William brandham lives because here the devil had his messenger here God had his messenger here the devil has ministers there sure must be ministers that will keep William bram's Word Alive there will be crows there will be crows there will be crows [Applause] let's go to the quotes quickly life 1957 that rock and roll Alvis Presley a modern Judas es scariot that boy was a Christian in a Pentecostal Church 1957 we only got it now but it was already laid down in 1957 who he was oh my god with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says with the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we know what he what they said they felt it on their flesh and brother Braham knows what he's talking about if Elvis had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he couldn't say he Judas a scariot because Judas scariot showed his colors when it came to the Holy Ghost hallelujah oh I feel like the messenger of God this morning Hallelujah I feel like an angel amen the fold Ministry is an angel that the angel of the [Applause] church Hallelujah glory to God in the highest amen listen Pentecostal church amen now listen what brother BR says I know he's Pastor the prophet know Alvis Presley's Pastor he knew the man that actually pastored him when he was small until he became a rock and roll king can you imagine how brother brandham spoke to the pastor listen I knew his Pastor oh oh God I knew his Pastor Elvis Presley's Pastor his mother his mother and them well he knew Elvis Presley mother well and he called Alvis Judas and listen what he says listen what he says nation has ever listen what he says the greatest hindrance at this nation no I'm not there uh listen what he says the Holy Ghost I know his parents his mother and them well but he sold his Birthright why did you read Esau because Esau is the one that sold his Birthright amen with tears why did Elvis cry brother Brown says he sold his Birthright don't sell your Birthright don't sell your Christian don't give it to the dogs and tomorrow you want to come back you can't make it brother then you have to make your way to hell i'll imagine Elvis pressure will be All Shook Up on that morning sure enough his records will be a reality when he hears the bleeding of the millions of souls that he that he sends to hell not that the devil sent to that Elvis sent to hell now if Elvis my brothers could take souls to Hell there must be five for Ministries that will take souls to heaven give me your soul your pastor will see you [Applause] [Music] through hallelujah hallelujah but El expressly perverted the listen what he says but Elvis prey perverted the right thing when he was a Christian he took the right thing and perverted it that's why after he feels so guilty they say that he would call the blackhood brothers and all that and he'll make them sing right through the night until the next morning to try and kill the conviction of the Holy Ghost and to try to get nearer to God and he could not get nearer to God and friends once you cross the line there is no way you can get closer to God there is no way that you can come to God it's finished finished finish try to get near to God perverted the right thing that Elvis Presley sang was the right thing perverted the prophet knew his mother Point number one and his Pastor the prophet says he sold his Birthright just like Esau did had the Holy Ghost Amen on the the outside realm until G pimples came his records will be played on Judgment Day right on Judgment Day Jail House Rock that the jail house is rocked what is the jail house the Bible says that the devil doesn't open his prison house his jail house it will be rocking as it welcomes millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions to hell you cannot just go to hell somebody's going to lead you there and you cannot go to heaven unless somebody lead you [Applause] then he sent them to hell in the Millions Elvis perverted the right thing many of people on that all Baptist songs and I want to tell you did you notice that Elvis sang All the Small the the the the slow hymns the hymns that the so-called Baptist in the message like Elvis also sang it so don't give it to Edgar Rosco amen it's not the hymn that you sing it's the spirit behind the hymns yes it is what Spirit leads you to sing amen that slow song songs or the fast songs if it's a wrong Spirit it is [Applause] wrong brother Bram says in spiritual atmosphere amen I wish I could just get it spiritual atmosphere just give me a chance I got a things to line up here page 11 somewhere around page 11 marmala series amen man marvelously he says take it in in the devil's work go over and say we're going to dance one man standing up and saying well now he don't know about whether he wants to dance or not and this girl over and she she that and the music playing Nearer My God to thee listen nearer slow song Nearer My God to me ah what an atmosphere for a dance well that's not any differ than what a lot of atmosphere you go into church for a service of God just that contrary says what an atmosphere near to my God to me he says the only thing to bring the right atmosphere then for the dance is to put on their old music that makes dances in other words Nearer My God to me you can't dance with it amen and when are you going to fulfill the word when you have near my God to me every week in your church that means you're not fulfilling the Bible you're not fulfilling the word and the bride will be the word of God from Genesis to Revelation she'll sing near to my God to me and she'll sing a nice song for the dance amen for jubilation that Jesus Christ is alive and the Seven Seals is full back Hallelujah hit the balance hit the balance I'm glad for El Tabernacle we hit the [Applause] balance Hallelujah oh God Amen going to take my time yet countdown Sunday 1964 and this is the reason why go into South Africa listen not into Mexico not into amen Ghana not into uh Zimbabwe not into England not into Germany but go into South Africa going to South Africa and they were so why Elvis Presley is a very religious boy did you hear that on the video he the prophet brings in 1964 Elvis press is a very religious boy he sings hymns oh that doesn't mean nothing to me it's another Judas es scariot all the nice hymns that he sang all the good How Great Thou Art amen the devil also knows how great he [Applause] is that don't make him a Christian if Elvis prey was a Christian why did he die of drugs his music took him to drugs and maybe that same music will take them to Armageddon right in South Africa here in South Africa they say he's religious you know he sings religious songs and and and and and you know and you listen here not all over in South Africa not here here we say what the prophet says he is a incarnate devil yes he is handwriting on the wall 1958 and Elvis Presley and make a little album or some kind of a religious service right after the meetings religious service rock and roll on one side and religion on the other side the prophet knew Alva sang religious songs and with who did he sing it bugat there now now shook his his hips and just now real sad and singing one song he gave the whole night for the devil and he gave a little two minutes for God my God needs all the time either you serve God or you don't serve him at all either you do what God wants you to do or you don't do it at all young people either you serve God or set it home until you made up your mind that it's not one side the world and one side God it's all Bes sides [Applause] God we making sense to the word of God Now understand why brother Brenham says and I could never understand it I'm long in the message and that doesn't mean that I'm saved because I'm long in the I must fight the fight but I'm just saying that to make a point I could never understand the unentertained Christ Jesus with dir fet where he says that these singers they keep in the note until they blew in the face and I said Lord who is is he speaking about why does he say that until I saw this video they were right there when brother Brenham was there and brother Brenham saw them amen singing amen hymns with uh Elvis Presley and brother Brenham nailed Elvis Presley and he turned around he says and this Bunch that keeps that breath in so long to keep the note he says they not singing for God that was not singing for God [Applause] now I have the sense to what brother Brandon says I looked right in there and God showed me right in there listen here this is that bigus uh concubines that brother brandham spoke about they are concubines of Elvis Presley he pregnated them with hell now they sing until tears run down their cheeks hey do you know how many Souls you sent to hell I don't care how many hmns you sing and how many video tapes is out you're still making money brother brandom says God is never without a witness cuz the devil is never out without a witness let me be God's witness oh God help us it's all that we ask help us by faith Moses 958 I don't care how many albums Alvis Presley writes of all the good religious songs good religious songs soft religious songs nice religious songs How Great Thou Are he touched me and all that that do baptist in the message love Elvis sang it brother brandham says he's still possessed of the devil your pastor can sing all that soft songs and all that BST songs he can still be possessed with the devil even if he sings that it is the spirit behind [Applause] it hit the balance get the balance [Applause] oh God says you never heard of a name like that in days gone by Alvis or Ricky and it just a name of the age that name had to come when the other name Brenham came there was never a Brenham a ham amen with letters from the time of Abraham and here that name had to come in the end hour but Judas also amen and send a man with a name for the first time Alvis showing you God showing you the devil oh people young people let your eyes open that name could only come in this hour Elvis he here oh here's where I go home Lord Christ the mystery 1963 if you only knew the numerology of the Bible and know what Elvis or Ricky means to the scriptures if you only knew the Bible Code the numerology the Bible Code he says you will otherwise run away from Elvis and what did I do when I got this quot i Phone brother Willies I said check this up in the numerology of the Bible check what the Bible says in the [Applause] Torah about Elvis and in the King James virgin and when they look into the Bible Code long before Elvis was born 4,000 years ago God wrote of Elva's name right in the numerology young people I'm not playing right in the numerology right in the Bible Code because brother Braham say in a numerology of the Bible he knew one day it will come forth and there will one be one person that will not be scared to use it and that's Edgar [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Rosco Hallelujah in the numerology of the Bible what Elvis mean and the Bible quote says Elvis mean Evil 2 Peter 52 1 Samuel 8:3 that's a Bible quote the second thing that Elvis means is a liar a beast a deceiver a devil amen this is on one Matrix in Elvis's name that is what he is that's what the Bible says he is and I don't care how you feel I don't care what you think if the Bible says he's a devil then he is a [Applause] devil Hallelujah and you can follow the devil if you want to young people but Jesus Christ is here amen the angel with a swap back Wings the eighth messenger Jesus Christ I will follow him [Applause] Hallelujah and around the other one the other metrix is Elvis and Elvis means rockar Amen on one metrix that is circled around his name when his name comes then next to his name rockar and it's circled this is thousands of years before Elvis was born the Bible already said he's coming oh god brother Bram says the numerology of God run for your lives young people run for your lives and the next metrics under Alvis will say shackles and silver and money with Alvis sheckles money and brother Braham say is a more than judas's Carri it Judah sold Christ for 30 pieces of silver and he for millions of dollars and yet the Bible says it that his name is connected with money and the Bible says that Lucifer set on the money of the world young people young people wake up and the num numerology of God goes on Amen on the next metrix it says connected with Elvis is hell in Hell the next metric Elvis in hell where did he go to although he's saying how great thou art it doesn't mean that you saved you seen great how great you are but you live like a devil only one way it's the way I laid down in this church Holiness Hallelujah not the word not the revealed word not the spoken word the manifested word when those words are manifested then you saved not the books when the books is living in you not the spoken wood book The spoken wood book is paper that paper must change into flesh written Apostles read of all man then you're marching to heaven [Applause] proper Revelation a decent Revelation where there's no vision that people die Hallelujah in Hell Elvis the Bible Code the Bible and the Elvis next to that is in hell and you're following a man like that that's already in hell young people AR shaking you today and wherever the tape goes every young person will be shaken show me who you follow then I'll tell you who you [Applause] are in the next metrix it says we took Presley and Presley is connected with petition second Peter 37 that's the Bible the six metric says another metric says with Presley comes drugs cause his death you mean thousands of years before he died of drugs the Bible says Presley dies of drugs and then he dies of drugs is that thus saith the Lord yes yes it is I will take the Bible and I will reject every other minister if he says that Elvis is saved I'll say no he crossed the line like Judas scariot and like Esau heard the truth heard the truth heard the truth heard he must change his life heard it but never done it and the day that they really want to get saved With Tears in their eyes they cannot come God is Not mocked he died of drugs and I think he tried to drown his convictions after when he couldn't find repentance the best thing to give drugs is the best thing to give up drugs is never to start with it I won't be able to help you when you cross that line loving kindness and Alvis prey with his All Shook Up rock and roll the reason you do it because something in there making and craving for that if the Holy Ghost hand had that heart fold you wouldn't have no desire for Alvis fres and his rock and roll there BR puts the things straight and the Holy Ghost is there your desires are [Applause] changed God keeps his word 57 I do not like to call people's names but I'm going to call somebody somebody his name now but I pray for the young man and I pray all the time for him but he is a instrument in the hands of the devil and that is this man Elvis Presley the people are gone Boogie hooi and rock and roll wild I like church music played like church music and not rock and roll in the church but when they get the spirit there's something something behind this you see I said the spirit there's something behind that Spirit whether it's soft music and nice hymns there's a spirit behind it you're doing that because you don't like the Holy Ghost that's why you like that soft music because you don't like dancing that's why you don't want the church to dance there's a spirit behind it with your soft HS message Pastor I pull no punches and I have no Reg [Applause] RS so like for there's something behind this and the devil puts himself out a challenge and it happens to be that this poor backslid Pentecostal boy shaking he caught it and learned it in church he is a member of the first Assemblies of God in Memphis Tennessee his Pastor is a friend of mine and he is the devil's instrument for delting and polluting the minds of the teenagers that's why I said this is for the young people polluting the minds of the young people they just left the place in Canada and I think they sent 14 young people to the insane asylum a few days after he was there they went cuckoo when to get this quotes and there's a lot that I still bring out watching Jesus feet and Elvis pry and all that there nonsense that's produced and put out to the American people's minds is contaminated with such stuff and then it even get into the Ministeries and they try to flower the pulpit they try to flower the pullit with that Elvis Presley is like he said in South Africa they say he religious they flower the poit did you realize that that is exactly what Cain did you know where that uh uh Cain come from Cain he had an altar same as Abel Kane had an altar and Elvis Presley had an altar what was his altar all the scils that he's saying and what does the altar do call you to some place Cain had an altar and Abel had an altar brother Brenham had an altar and Elvis had an altar Elvis altar took them to hell and God has an altar that can take you to heaven hallelujah hallelujah he types Elvis with Cain and Esau another altar rock and roll alar and the altar of God listen to this Corinthians book of symbols 957 and you get these little old sissified man today with a shock of hair cut down low on his neck like that and a pair of side barns like Elvis Presley and stand up and make all this boogie hooie stuff and you Christians try to impersonate an impostor like that now if you have sideburns you impersonating Elvis Presley I'm so glad I don't have gluts so that it can fall down here I'll be too scared to cut the gluts off cuz I want to be like Elvis I want to feel it in my neck I don't have to feel it in my neck I want to feel it in my heart [Applause] the side Burns cut it off young man if your hairstyle is like Elvis hairstyle amen it just speaks about Elvis you're keeping Elvis alive with that hairstyle evidence of the Resurrection 58 there's only one difference between Elvis and judas's carrier Judas got 30 pieces of silver for selling out Elvis got a few Millions dollars and a fleet of Cadillacs that's all the difference you can take all of your little old chopped up Elvis Pressly boogie hooi in the name of Christianity you can have it give me those oldfashioned heart stirring love songs of the Gospel heart stirring [Music] that's a sped behind it hard storying God's gifts always finds 1963 Elvis Presley red FY Ernie for pet Bo Elvis Presley a Pentecostal Paton a Church of Christ red Ford a deacon in the Church of Christ Ernest for I think is a Methodist C Richards so called Born Again Michael Jackson Jehovah Witness they're all religious the word Elvis means a cat and the word Ricky means a rat you can go look in the dictionaries you won't find it there until you see the the numerology of the of the Bible Code his real name is in the Bible Code not what what some scientists try to make him nice he's not nice he sent a lot of my brothers to hell every time music comes comes the hairstyle oh edar Rosco even stops the woman at the door yes I will because no rock star or pop star or whatever star is going to walk in here in another form in another person amen by having that haircut she's actually carrying

asleep wake up parents music has brought all the devil's fth to the four and some of our brothers if there's a concert the gospel concert they go no spirituality whatsoever hallelujah it's only Devils that's trying to sing and trying to get close to God and they knew that they crossed the line and you go there just like uh just like these guys the quartet amen try to to to sooth Alvis Presley we're not here to sooth Alvis Presley he wanted to go to hell he chose to go to hell but I choose to go to heaven so I don't have to listen to him that's right it's exactly right amen hallelujah they more famous amen and music brought all the forth into the world and then after the Beatles came another Englishman Alton John oh he's so wonderful Alton John he sang for Dianne and Dianne is adulterous Hallelujah Dian is an adulterous th say the [Applause] Lord and Elon John is a homo he's a Mory so he yet he sings for an adulterous and he she's an adulterous by sexual intercourse with another man's wife amen husband and yeah he is a mhe candles in the night man I'm not the child of the night man I'm the child of the day I don't need a candle I have the shikina glory the seven candlesticks amen change into the eighth messenger which is the light of the world Jesus the light of the [Applause] world hallu and with Al and John came Cliff Richards another mhe son I I will be a bachelor boy until my D you know why you're a bachelor boy because you're a Muffy it's only a Muffy that doesn't want to get married amen God says take a wife and get [Applause] married this is the star that our young people want to follow I'm bashing them young people I'm bashing them I'm nailing them because my Prophet said he doesn't pull punches when it comes to these rock and roll guys and after C Richards came Bob Marley another hairstyle we must get done with his Bob Marley hairstyles that Bob Marley openly declares drugs openly young people please listen to this preacher and get away from those singing preachers [Applause] and how did Bob Mali die he died of a overdose of drugs M [Applause] Johan that's the people the young people following Maniacs Bob Marley amen and he died and the Bible Code says on Bob Marley just it wasn't even it wasn't even 2 seconds and we got Bob Marley and the Bible says Bob Marley in the code puts drugs with Bob Marley now say the Bible is wrong and that was their thousands of years before Bob Mary was born the Bible says Bob Mary drugs how can they make it when the Bible knew about them before they came here not one that Paul says follow me don't follow these rock stars follow me as I follow Christ [Applause] now comes the King of Pop Elvis prey the king of rock now comes the worst of them all the worst of them all Michael daxon he's the worst of them all never in the history of music was there ever a man named Michael CU Michael ends it the Torah says in the Bible Code about Michael Jackson Michael Jackson it says evil devil murderer it goes in the other metrics it says an Avenger of blood El's Blood Cuz Elvis couldn't take them further into hell he'll take them they say he's more greater than Alvis Presley made more money than Alvis Presley he man he had more audiences than Alvis Presley he was he's The Beetles and Elvis Presley in one person and if the Bible says that he's the Evangel of blood and he is and next to his name is Priscilla Elvis's daughter he couldn't marry anybody but Elvis's daughter because he had to match up with Elvis in marriage man what are you hearing what are you hearing man amen we preach the word the reveal word the Revelation made sense to bring a manifestation he had to marry Priscilla Elvis's daughter and he's got the what you call it on all Elvis Presley's music you can't have Elvis press his music until you write to Michael Jackson the two have become one the one started it the other one finished it the one came with the name of brandham and the other one came in the name of a man that's called the Apostle of God could only come now the two names had to come together don't care what you say it's the truth [Applause] [Applause] right in the hour right in the hour where a Ministry came by Revelation and preached Michael and open up Michael a fire4 minister amen and went around the world and place Michael right at that hour right at that time now I spoke about Michael years ago and I was first down by the ministers because they didn't know Christ the mystery and I read it right in Christ the mystery and I said it and they said where did he get it from even up till now they said where does he get it from but if you're not call on my realm it's up to you I preach according to my [Applause] faith Elvis Presley could only move his pis because he was Elvis pis but Michael Jackson moves his toes until his head he could go like this and there's nobody they said never will there ever be a man that will be able to dance like Michael [Applause] Jackson any brother Brandon felt like that about Alvis how would he have felt about Michael Jackson and the same thing that God spoke about Elvis it speaks about Michael Jackson have we got it I was amazed when I saw him dancing now you said did you watch it I'll watch it because I want to preach on it I never knew it and brother and watched Elvis and he knew what Elvis sang and who sang with Elvis that's why he could preach against it brother Bram says even the Beatles they are healers and he made one of the brothers read a cut out of Readers Digest how the Beatles healed people and of there was never never a man like that worse than Elvis Presley I wonder young people are these the men that you would like to follow or wouldn't you want me to lead you to Jesus [Applause] Christ MS [Music] Mendoza R Kelly Ricky Martin Britney Spears is all his epies they look to him and he him is a malista of children and right now he's just around children elvil took the teenagers to hell and he's getting them right in the 2-year-old brackets to take them to Hell two years but as long as this man is here I'm going to preach to those twoyear olds and show them the FK for say a 2-year-old child can understand God is the only man that changed himself into a ghost only one and young people want to follow him oh my God you know because of music of young children is having drugs cigarettes ilicit sex all this fils because of Music young people why don't you start just telling your school mates listen you I'm not going to hell with you if you don't go to heaven with me I'm not going to hell with you why don't you take a stand like they take a stand for mendosa and them and Jackson and them why can't you take a stand for Jesus Jesus the wonderful one the one that I love the message of the hour brought by the mouth of a prophet amen I'm closing play for me something Michael Jackson then came with a hairstyle with one lock in his eyes and young sister you come with locks like that you're representing Jackson Michael please stop them give them a comb to comb their hair right we don't want [Music] that it started with Elvis Presley and could this be the last one Michael Jackson a black one could it be like the Pope the last one a black one that'll being in the 666 because it started with Nimrod and the whites had that chance and now it ends with the black man I don't know could it be like the last Jews that came to Israel was black Ethiopians I'm asking you to be [Music] spiritual the last one to cause the Rapture a black one that brother bam says that might come out of Africa or America whatever but it might be a black soul wherever he comes from I don't know I'm asking I'm just a student of the word I love the word I love the spoken word I'm a student could it be the angel that came to brother brandham was a dark skinned Angel could it be the Jewish rabbi said there's only one dark skinned Angel is Michael so the devil sends another dark skinned one to end it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] off young people I'm asking you if you don't listen to me behold your Gods if you listen to me you'll deny those [Music] Stars I wonder can we just open this way for the young

here today we're so glad that we could take a piece of your life to be with us and I hope that we would not waste your time I do not believe that the man should go to church just to consume time just because you've got nothing to do and you feel religious and you're going to waste your time then you get nothing I believe we come to church come through the doors when you leave when you leave you should feel a difference I do not have much more time on this Earth since the time 1951 when brother Branham lady's head ladies hands on this here I'm the only I'm the only preacher in South Africa that brother Branham laid his hands on [Applause] 1951. [Applause] and I've been here for 57 years I've established churches in every province in South Africa [Music] I wasted no time and most of the ministers come from yeah [Applause] most of them brother twine amend them all come from yeah we started it and we're going on so long as I got breath in mind nostrils I'm gonna push it amen so may God bless you we thank God for the mayor and our precious Pastor there we thank God that they could take off time of their busy schedule to be with us we do not feel Worthy but we do appreciate it so without any ado I like to bail into what I want to do today if you have your weapons with you As You Are the children of God we are going to turn our Bibles to familiar scripture that actually coincide with the happenings today we have come from Johannesburg to ordain a young man We Believe the fire of God is in his soul that has chosen straight and another way I don't easily ordained any person for my 57 years you can count them on one hand I first want to see fruit before I ordain anybody and I saw this young man didn't go to other churches to pull people away from another fall and he went into the streets today we're both churches from other churches we can't then we split the church to start a church but you can take your head off for a man that comes start a church without anybody outside the brothers we think I hear you that you made it God bless you if I can draw your attention to the book of Ephesians as the scholars name this book as the best writings of the first messenger in it it dovetails and parallels the Book of Joshua and Joshua is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4 11 you know the scripture but let us read it and he gave listen how it starts and he gave some not everybody although you can kick under Every Little Bush you kick a pasta out but the Bible said there's only some [Applause] [Music] it's not every football player that is a messy or a Ronaldo they all play football but there's one run out and there's one message so the Bible picks out of all of them some thank you some apostles don't stop there and some evangelists it's like a million not everybody can be a mayor but some that's why you can't help but take ministers and weigh them out you weigh them up why because some [Applause] the rest is not only there to fill up the Gap but they are not in the Sun [Music] some Prophets yes out of all the guys that say the prophets there's only some that's a real Prophets evangelists somebody told me brother Roscoe you'll never talk about evangelism evangelists I said now first bring me the guy that burns up the whole city and then I'll call him the evangelist if he didn't bring It One Soul then he is but only evangelist by name but evangelist pulls up to church [Applause] that's why you only have some that bring in Souls I had ministers for 40 years great preachers educational preachers but they didn't bring one Soul into El Tabernacle not one they call themselves evangelists but the work of the evangelists is not there some pastors to some of them not all of them some of them is 40 years here they've done nothing and now they leave the message where do they fall in they fall into some you cannot just join a church you're going to know why you're sitting in a church [Applause] and what will these five guys do they perfect the Saints and the minister in the church they would uplift and to edify the church they'll do anything [Applause] let us pray I think I'll really preach I'm not going to be able to finish this message father Jesus king God Jesus king of God we bow our heads before thee and oh God we're incapable to handle this meeting but father to fulfill all righteousness to not shun to declare all the councils we will stand in the gap and do thy will may you bless the reading of your word and oh God hide me behind the cross so the people don't see the scum that stands here but let they see the man that can cleanse the leper [Music] [Applause] I asked in Jesus name you maybe say that I'm sorry that you had to stand so long but if we Sing the anthem of South Africa then we stand the springboks are playing today and you're going to see they stand to the anthem of the hand on their heart and if we read the word of God this is the anthem of Heaven we stand to the word of God Amen if I should take a title out of there the way of a true preacher I'm going to ordain a preacher and that's why I'm titling this message the way of a true preacher and I want to take my inspiration through a prophet's message God call man [Applause] the man that God called that's why the Bible says he'll put into the church it's not the church putting in somebody as a pastor the minutes the church get involved in choosing a man of God they've been wrong all the time as long as the Deacon board come together and they put a man in there it is altogether wrong the minute the disciples chose Barnabas and not Paul because the church chose Barnabas they were wrong We cannot put anybody in behind this holy desk because the Bible says and God put bring that scripture back in and he who's he he gave he gave [Music] [Applause] not today we get a club of people a Ministerial Association in the message where ministers feel that one we're not having fellowship with him and we kick him out and we'll keep this one and we have fellowship with this one but the one they kick out is the one that God chose [Applause] [Music] we want people here behind the secret desk of God that is actually called a God that knows God we do not want hand-picked guys behind the pulpit and after 40 years they give up the message and they say that brother Branham is a false prophet they are hand-picked amen but if God put him to the church [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you alone [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and therefore I want to read the quote God call man listen to the title of this message listen to the vocabulary of a true prophet listen to what the man of God says the men of God says God has called The Man it won't help me if I call that young man because it is called by a man and it won't work and it can't work it will flop it will come to nothing if I have called that young man but if God called that young man [Applause] then nobody can stop him you can rather stop the Sun but you won't stop that young man if God has called him a man come hell or high water that young man will stand Hallelujah because he was not called by a man he was called by God Amen God called man I like that God is calling the man [Music] God called man God called man Page Six he says God cannot send a Revival till he's got man shake you take it why don't we have Revival in the message take me wherever you want to there is no Revival take me to a church that's a life there is no church alive take me to a place in the message where you can feel the Holy Ghost move there is no place take me to a place where people is drunk under the spirit there is no place why we were taught right [Applause] foreign they don't even know what's the Holy Ghost they don't even know City amen they know nothing about a Heavenly language they know nothing about speaking in tongues they know nothing about being drunk in the spirit why they're not shaped for the Revival [Applause] we cannot we cannot have a Revival until we get men oh I hope this young man is a man that'll shake the lovers out of Port Elizabeth [Applause] a god-called man listen to what he says God trained man now somebody's got a train somebody's got to train this man now if you don't have a trainer how can you have a man so you need a trainer you'll need somebody that knows God that's got proof behind him every man he's got fruit amen go wherever he goes That's truth amen you need a man like that to train this young man to come up higher amen a god-strained man [Music] oh [Applause] God's winning man that's not trained up in the schools of theology and of Education they preached today as if Oxford and Webster dictionary is her uncle and no Revival because they were trained in this in the school of theology come from the Bible School come from that school come from that school amen but they don't come from the train school where God trained his men [Applause] [Music] [Applause] when they preach it looks as if they swallowed in the whole Webster dictionary and there's no Revival there's nothing going on the people must take half an hour to actually work out what English word is used brother I don't have time for that I want some plain simple straightforward Gospel of Jesus Christ because the Bible says that the [Applause] that the simple heard Jesus [Applause] but you need old man that can train the young man now if the old man wasn't trained how is the young man going to be they gonna be twice as bad as the old man but give me an old man [Applause] that's been in the presence of God he can learn and teach the young man to be a god-called man [Applause] and he said further rugged Man of faith you don't have that rugged Man anymore because the man that that we have now in the message wants to be loved by everybody [Applause] and when you have a pastor that wants to be loved by everybody you got a compromise behind the death I don't want to be loved by everybody I want to be loved by God I want God's way to be my way every time Hallelujah I Wanna Be A Rocket Man [Applause] a rugged Man of faith that God has brought up in the school of his rugged training he must be hated and not loved by everybody [Applause] and still walk through that and say I shall not recant Luther will you re can I shall not regain rugged me Rocket Man that will stand [Applause] Amen on the word of God Amen [Applause] thank you [Applause] yes Rocket Man [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] don't see what I see I am not going to compromise with them I would rather not have them as my friends because this year is my friend [Applause] and he goes on and it says men who are not afraid to face the fire [Music] Shadrick and Magic and have an eagle we're heating up the fire for you you have to repaint and regret what you are standing for okay even if you heat it upwards 20 times we are not going to bow young man regardless of how the fires burn against you we gotta saw water the fire is heated and heated and heat it you have to turn around and say beat it even more but we won't bow down to what you think I'm a rugged man I'll play I walk into the fire [Applause] they too scared to walk into the fire they do scared to take a trial they do scared when people actually come up against them but God wants rocket man that will walk right through all that criticism and say we won't repent [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] God call man they walk through the fire and I thank God I hope that when this young man walk into the fire maybe his friends don't like the stand he took maybe the church in Port Elizabeth don't like it but he's prepared to walk into the fire and he would have never met the thought man he would have never met the thought of man unless he was prepared to walk in the fire the fourth man waited for him in the fire and the fourth man is walking again that thought man is walking again the postman is walking again the boss man is walking again through the fire through the storm through the smoke and through the Heat [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign this is harmony how many did we how many did he throw into this fire I I I thought it was it was three that we thought through into this fire he said but there's four and the Fourth Man and the thought man and glory to God the Batman The Postman in the fire look like the Son of God Amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and if each one of you walk into your fiery trials walk on you'll be the fourth man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] El Tabernacle Nebuchadnezzar the king the pastor of Babylon couldn't believe it he says bring them here bring them out of the fire and you know the dangerous part of it all [Music] the guys that threw them in the fire they died and if your pastor never taught you about the fire don't come near the fire you'll burn out you'll die and he brought them out and they stood in front of the king and the Bible says and the Bible says and the Bible says they took them and they smelled them and the Bible says and the Bible says they never ever smell like smoke not even smoke could get onto their garments and now because I said they don't even smell like smoke what smoke they never fell and smell like compromise or no compromising no smoke [Applause] no lovey-dovey with somebody that don't believe like them if you do that then you're smelling like smoke [Applause] rocket man who has come into the presence of God I know his power now if you don't have the Holy Ghost when did you come into the presence of God when the guys finish preach the church is dead dead there's no movement of the Holy Ghost there's nobody that's drunk they're making a mistake they think clamping hands and and shouting that's the Holy Ghost no that's the worship of the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues amen that is the Holy Ghost and dancing in the spirit [Applause] [Music] all right [Applause] now listen what he says men who are not afraid to face the fire men who come into the presence of God and knows his power they know the power two weeks ago or one week ago men stood up in the pulpit and said medicals count your money [Applause] oh you're there [Applause] [Music] when last do they see a miracle in this message two weeks ago a sister that had cancer Jonathan myself winnegan prayed for the doctor says it's all over and I mentioned count your Miracles one two three four I can hardly count them the Holy Ghost swept over the horse she got up to accept my miracle Monday she went to the doctors the doctors checked her he says you've got nothing there's no there's no cancer here no church can fly outside of the supernatural [Applause] [Music] count your miracles [Applause] a sister that couldn't fall pregnant right when the Miracles was going and the fourth man was walking and the fourth man was walking and she says Lord I claim the miracle I want to be pregnant and that Tuesday she went to the gynecologist said no Michael that's a near God amen you Franklin and Hallelujah count your Miracles it will surprise you because I know the supernatural [Applause] not only coming to church there must be Supernatural signs [Applause] [Music] some man that knows the Living God it's all right listen to what he says it's all right to be trained to train them by the word the prophet said the prophet said the quote says the Bible says it says all right to train them by the word is that the message is that what we hear the guy go to a concordance and he gets all the quotes on one word they come and read quotes he says it's not dead it's not the word it's not the quotes then what is it what did he says after that amen someone that's trying to know the loving God it's all right to train them by the word we're throwing them by the word all the years but we made a mistake it says spirit and then truth parrot and then the quotes [Applause] I don't listen to any guy that come into the pulpit I'll walk out I know he knows nothing he wasn't doing properly he didn't come through the school of the supernatural because brother Brown says they are trained by the word let's not do what he says but the letter killeth the more word you put in your church the more you kill the people you gave them so much word until now they don't believe the word get the spirit to get into the word that Dynamics to the mechanics then you'll see something moved [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know this is only my introduction all right [Applause] I'd like to put this one down and a teaching for this young man First Kings 18 20. now therefore sinned and gathered to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel the Elijah Ministry our ministry gather them around the pyramid Mountain and the prophet saw bar 450. and the prophets of groves 400. of them so it's 850 right 850. preachers [Music] and Elijah said Gather them gather them bring them what does an expert say the last which 850 preachers eating at Jezebel's table that means she supported her Jezebel was a meal ticket how many ministers is sitting at some rich guys table because he's pouring in money there [Applause] is no rich man that can buy this man unto expensive [Applause] I don't sit at Jezebel's table to have food amen I work for my food I don't need no rich man to sit at his table and prophesy what he wants me to prophesy a meal ticket young man don't let anybody buy you [Applause] the way of a true minister doesn't sit at the table of these rich guys [Applause] they work for their money you know here's page one I haven't started preaching you [Applause] so the Continental Doctrine of the anti-message is for a young man to watch a woman to watch money to watch popularity money woman popularity how many of these men fell with women well you know that seven times this is the seven Villages but you slept with four women you want to tell me that's the virtues you're playing Seven Virtues huh and the guy that brought it amen died and he said he's gonna come back with blue eyes you wouldn't like this eh you don't like it huh but I'm here before all of them [Applause] woman money locks on a woman it's the same spirit when you have money you want more money when you have one woman and you've got a human Spirit you want another one Same Spirit when you are popular you want everybody to like you Same Spirit that's the Cardinal Doctrine of the message [Applause] what is it money Balaam woman Samson Delilah popularity Saul and then when they die these Thunder guys foreign but seventh under seven virtues [Applause] both fool somebody else you don't like it that's your business okay God called The Man God put into the church not the church put into the church Jeremiah 23 verse 4. and I was I God will shed set Shepherds over them which shall feed them the guy come to the pulpit and he's got nothing a quote after a quote after a quote after a quote they light the camel dry you know the quotes back to front how can you still read quotes to me that's 57 years here I know that I need something fresh on that quote and the only thing that kept the word fresh is that Shekinah Glory the only thing that will keep the the quotes fresh it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] and I will put Shepherds not the church God will put Shepherds over them which shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they lack saith the Lord they will be fed they don't eat this week out of the garbage cans of the Pentecostals and tomorrow TD Jakes and after that old son and after that amen the Thunders and after that they leave the message they get to a place where they have a Shepherd that feeds them they don't have to go and get fed by anybody else [Applause] they will lack nothing the Sheep will be fed [Music] so we are not ordaining a gift I'm not gonna attain this young man because he's got a gift I'm not ordaining a gift we are daining fruit because everybody's got a gift [Applause] I had men that as a gift of preaching that your hair will raise after they preach but there's no Supernatural there's no souls coming in they got a gift but they don't have no fruit so I'm not ordaining a gift I'm ordaining fruit Romans 11 29 says for the gifts and callings of God or our worth that guy can have a preaching gift and he's not even repented but he's got a gift because God gave him a gift it's without repentance Matthew 7 20 wherefore by their fruits you shall know them you want to know what's the right thing you want to know what's the right Pastor he wants to know what's the right man of God you want to know what's the right Ministry there's only one way to know it by that fruit have they got fruit [Applause] take 40 years here and there is no fruit but the great preachers you get a great preacher with no fruit or you get a great preacher with no signs no wonders no miracles for the great preachers he must have the whole toot Jesus Says by thy fruit you shall know them where did he get it from numbers chapter 17 verse 3. there's where Jesus got it from numbers 17. and he came to pass that on the marrow Moses went into the Tabernacle of witnesses and behold the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was spotted and brought forth buds bloomed blossomed and healed almonds [Applause] it brought forth fruit and Jesus took it from there and say bye that fruit you will know them but what happened over there he had 12 preachers there was 12 of them and it took all 12 preachers because they all says we preachers they all says we called he says now take all of them bring in bring them into the holy of holies and the next morning when Moses went into the holy of holies there was only one out of 12. some that is some out of 12 1. [Applause] one one one was called [Applause] have you found that one [Applause] are they fruit you shall know them not by the eloquency not by that Doctrine doctorate not by them knowing everything by the fruit just for a little while and I'm gonna close we need preachers of solid mold they must be molded solidly because he is the porter you are the clay and God molds his man for the hour that you live in and that man then will be a god-called man they won't like him a real man of God is never loved they never liked a real God man why because he's molded by God because he said Thou Art the porter I'm the claim mold me Lord make me the way you want me to be made show me how I must preach Lord so that I can get that last one in we need preachers of solid mold [Applause] heroic a Heavenly

the power must imitate the gospel must copy cat the gospel you must be a carbon copy of the Gospel you must mimic the gospel you're a clone of the Gospel and then what then what Pastor Oscar what until he become the gospel on two feet [Applause] okay [Applause] [Applause] young man you must go on in your eager to suit of the war and more and more holiness not Holiness alone but more and more and more holiness equals godliness [Applause] [Music] more and more and more holiness equals godliness they must mistake you for God liness and add to your faith godliness what is godliness provinces

the pastor you know and we'll get all the tides I said Lord give them trials that they give up [Applause] it's not trial of Tides it's trials more and more trials if you're preaching you don't have trials go back and start all over again you have must something because now if you don't have trials the devil likes you [Applause] I'm gonna close the preaching man must become the prayer man that's his weapon The Preacher Man must become the praying man because that's his weapon brother Roscoe why are you so successful why is all your churches right around the country full I don't have to put a seat here and a seed here and a seed here to pull wool over people's eyes at my church is full put the seeds together then you only have two rows full the churches don't even have a hundred people anymore what's going on you're here for 20 years and you don't even have 20 people but what about you brother Oscar I got 3 000 in one place why because the preacher man must be a praying man everybody careful man but be careful [Applause] but [Applause] that's an undying unending weapon the ears that hears him he is him forever if he prayed over the sermon I want to tell you something you know in the lockdown nobody had Church and we just play tapes and I baptize a hundred people without having church just from the tapes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the ears that Hears A man that comes from his knees hears him forever the anointing just come off the tape we play tapes that I preached 25 years ago and that tapes will still win souls why [Applause] why must he pray because the real sermons is made in the closet in the study alone with God when he is alone with God then the real sermon come and he preached that sermon and that sermon is energized for 20 solid years [Music] Hallelujah and the people that hear that sermon says man it looks as if this thing was preached just the other day why because that sermon was made on his knees in the closet of his study [Applause] the modern preacher the more money he gets and the more secure he is by money amen is the preacher that has come up from his knees he prays and he gets and he don't pray anymore no ready Mana the Mercedes-Benz Equity you know Mike but [Applause] I'm going to close I don't say the man say closing he never closer he lies I didn't say what time I'm gonna close [Applause] but lest they pray the more money they make they pray Lord give me a million God gives him a million and then after that they don't pray luxury spoils the preacher it takes him from his knees and close the engine of his soul towards holiness these profound as conviction is born in secret conversation and communion with God oh my best times is when I'm alone and I speak to God that's my best time [Applause] that's the reason the world over go wherever you want to I challenge you in the name of God go wherever there's a message Church and go and see how weak the pulpit is just be honest you know there's no honest people in this message they're not honest ly why must I hear one quote after one quote after one quote amen and I know the quotes I'm hearing the quotes for 60 years man certificate it's Anna the life-giving preacher is the true man of God oh I like a thirsty preacher man that makes other people thirsty what a man that is after he leaves the pulpit he sermons lost for over 20 years [Applause] now the preacher that kills is a preacher without the spirit that's the preacher that kills near my end Spirit isn't moved by the word is false anointed ones and the word without the spirit is false anointed ones and the spirit and the word without the spirit is foolish virgin if the spirit isn't mixed with the word it kills the latter killeth by the spirit giveth life remember this young man never preach without the Holy Ghost it's the letter preacher that kills that preaching without the spirit kills why do you think the message right around the world is dead because we only gave them word all the time right in America all over they did why because there's no spirit it's in word word word word word man is a bunch of nonsense says it [Applause] it kills word preaching kills so a young man makes that word with a meal and the oil you'll have a cake coming it's a letter preacher that kills the word messages are only word in this message and the person because those has a glorious time jubilating praising God even without the word they're more happier than what we are so when I'm in a message you know we're going to hold my message you know but just do it he's doing it [Applause] the elected Pentecostals forms the headstall now how can you be elected Pentecostal when you sit like this the preaching that kills is a shapely and orderly and eloquent and fluent Place preaching and no spirit it kills more than error this is told the letter it's told that date later the letter was dead in the Old Testament it was cold it was formal until that seed came into the New Testament and the duck flew over Mary and then the the word loved but it was dead all the time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen Philippians come Glory no God is Not mocked you can

Jesus the light of the world father we glad to call you father thank you that we could gather her like this Lord and thank you for sending light it's good to find the way but oh God if the way hasn't got light then we'll get lost Lord you might walk over onto the sidewalk or we might trip over some cobblestones but thank you for the light that's on this way the pull off fire the Morning Star that could lead us through Lord we pray this morning as we come to eat of your hand Lord William we need you we need some more fuel to tip us up just to get out of here Lord therefore we ask of you God to come and help us here The Invasion is on people is opening up now to get baptized with the nicolaitan spirit there is also a bride that's opening up to be invaded from the astronaut of Heaven May invade us Lord we ask these Mercies not that we're Worthy but you're the worthy one this morning I give myself into your hand and report for service I give you my gift Lord may you take that gift and work with it pull me aside and use my gift I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ because what good is a gift if I can't get out of the way for you to lose that gift then we can say shine all around us by day and by night I hand this meeting into your hands may your undertake for us amen and amen if you have your Bibles with you Booker Daniel 9. 21 down to verse 24. you also was speaking in prayer while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in division at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touch me about the time of the evening oblation right at the evening time he touched me while I was speaking in prayer Gabriel flew in while we speak about Daniel May Gabriel not drop down here because he can only announce what's going to take place but let Michael drop down here because he can transform and deliver we already had the announcement we already heard from Genesis 18 Elohim Michael Gabriel Gabriel already announced but we need Michael the angel to deliver us give us strength help us write about the evening time you while I was speaking in prayer I like that and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding at the beginning of thy supplication the Commandments came forth and I come to show thee but Thou Art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and and considered a vision it's quite something Daniel a Jew Joseph a jewel Gabriel said to them but Michael can go both ways Jill and Gentile Raphael the angel stand on the backside drop down through the anointing of the elders healed sister ghani they are here brother Branham calls him the angel of healing the one that stirs the water an ear drop in there and you get healed by that angel at the beginning of thy supplication at the beginning of your prayers when you're laid in front of me the Commandment came forth and I have come to show thee but Thou Art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to do what Point number one to finish transgression Point number two to make make an end of sins Point number three and to make reconciliation [Music] for iniquity Point number four and to bring in Everlasting righteousness Hallelujah Point number five and to seal up the vision and the prophecy Point number six and to anoint for the last time the most holy the six-fold purpose that's why I said you cannot preach purpose unless you preach a mind and when you preach mind you cannot have mind unless you have a prophet therefore the prophet could say six fold purpose and then he comes back in a seal book everything God has three fold purpose and he comes after the seal book and he preached the threefold purpose and they stealing the messages but that same message on purpose they preach they're going to stand in front of God and give an account what they've done with their message brother Branham reaches and the gold mines and the diamond mines of South Africa he means more to us than anything else so we thank him and we praise him what a wonderful savior is he don't you love him this morning now it's been preached The Invasion it has come into the newspaper and that's a rock newspaper and brother Branham says this if a man preaches and God comes behind it like that then it was not the man it was God [Music] [Applause] so we must have heard the voice of God in this couple of months that has elapsed now I can only come and fulfill my purpose and fulfill what God sent me to do and I cannot vouch for anybody else but even if I try to do something else I can't because every man of God is in prison like Paul being a prisoner of Christ we can only do what God has ordained us to do on this mother earth nothing more nothing less and we want to finish the course we one till to get to the bottom and that we could turn around and say we didn't shun to declare all the Praises of God all the councils of God before we leave this world behind and it's so very soon that we're going to go home and we're going to do everything in our power and you see how God is Healing The Sick we had another and announce of last week and Saturday the young sister fullness and told us in Cape Town how are the people is getting healed and I what I'd done was after we had the prayer line I came behind I says now some of you still have the pain and you still feel sick and all that I said but after a while the Holy Ghost will visit you one by one by your house I said the I said the angel of the Lord will visit you one by one at your homes and uh for this last three weeks the testimonies are coming in and last week and Saturday nights sister back at home when we just came back from the um uh uh combined or was it Sunday one of the two days but it was just after we made that announcement and then she told my wife please tell brother roscom that we stole getting in testimonies of the healing power of almighty God psalm very sure something going on we're not just coming to church and sit around the Supernatural is all around you and you supposed to be in desperation amen and um Shiva spoke about the message says even I a lot of churches outside is buying the message that I preached down there pain and um we really glad for what God is doing no I had quite a few invitations to go out this year but as we see such a lot of things are happening I don't feel really or maybe if God speaks to my heart I might move but as far as my mind is concerned because my heart can only do what my mind says and uh as far as my mind is concerned I'd like to stay around and just see a couple of months left and get behind me so I can feel okay because [Music] um everything is ready everything is planned and purpose and on the verge of breaking forth so we really thank God that we posted my concern goes a lot to the young people I am concerned about him and I want you to get the Holy Ghost because if you're not going to get the Seal of God you are not going to stand repentance is all right it's good to repent every day please but the conversion is the thing the Holy Ghost is the thing it's good to be baptized but friends you can be saved and yet not converted and conversion only comes by a baptism so we pray that God would invade you as brother Lenny or Somebody Prayed with the Holy Ghost then I'll feel good then you can go to as many sessions you want to go you can smoke as many cigarettes you want to smoke you can go with any wealthy friend as much as you want to go I feel safe because you're gonna run away there the Holy Ghost is not going to keep you in one of those places so before visiting those places and having a worldly friend get the Holy Ghost and once you have the Holy Ghost then you can do what you want to do all that I know that you seal till the day of your Redemption so my work here is to give you the Holy Ghost God can't do anything in the interval unless he sealed the 144. with the same baptism that's here now I'm glad that God has given me one thing in this life to give out the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm satisfied and when the young people has the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you can touch one another I want to see if you will be able to go like because the Holy Ghost is a counter it can't smoke it can't drink [Applause] it can't touch a woman it can't touch a man it's a counter can't look at television that's the reason the people fear it can't put the see-through blouse on can't put a short dress on can't have bob hair cut hair but I like the sconther amen so let's get the Holy Ghost a lot of things are going on a lot of things is going past many people but God has been good to us their eyes is open about a year and a half ago we preached when money fails many thought it was just a good message many thought it was just a time to pass by in the Church of God but it was prophecy we told you when you start seeing things like that look up your Redemption is drawing now and those other things that we're watching because brother Branham told us to watch it those are the things that we underline because brother Branham says underline it [Music] and just a couple of weeks ago in Time Magazine how low can it go how low is the dollar and I told you when I preached and I came back from the states last year and I told you about the book there economical earthquake that this guy said that you would only going to America is only going to have two years and it's not even two years yet and she's plunging and when she goes money fails right around the world I looked at how the Jesuits worked out the whole thing what has the dollar got to do with the Yen and with her Benchmark and with the Rand and with the power what what I mean what but it shows you there's power behind the monetary system and the German's money is one of the strongest in Durham Japanese yen is the strongest but they say if this still goes down further than they their money that's so strong will have to go down as well when the dollar goes the whole world goes for each two years ago this day the scripture of Genesis is fulfilled in front of your very eyes [Applause] where Joseph says in Genesis and money fails now when money fails then also on the other side the perfect man is just about to be birthed [Applause] and when the perfect man gets birth then Perfection hits the pyramid then they cannot be made perfect unless we hit perfection then our Perfection raises the Dead 30 40 days of Revival in the sixth time mention where no eye natural eye sees it but our eyes because we'll see our loved ones 30 40 days Revival then we'll fly away in the morning then the interval breaks [Applause] praise God our ministry is not like the other Ministries this is something different here we don't want to say that but it's the truth Suleiman we took her out last night and she said something that really shook my wife and myself and I won't mention some of the sisters that she mentioned and down in Cape Town whenever I go down there and they said man we don't want to listen to anybody but when brother Roscoe come we want to be there because we're going to get something and she turned around she says yeah I just wish that you don't put too much emphasis on the man to let the man fall because we realize that God gave that man something but the tower is too late for any falling it can only be a rapture [Applause] so Wednesday night we're gonna play again when money fails to you bring your mind into rapturing faith and if I catch your mind I don't care about the perfect man character forget you here I've got you all the other things will be added then this alone was a message I Can Say Goodbye [Music] but we still have until six o'clock tonight [Applause] I'm so happy we'll walk in the light oh such a beautiful life what a beautiful light I want to do everything to stay in this light amen so may God just take the gift this morning and do whatever he wants to do with the gift pull the gift this way pull it that way Lord I'm reporting for service each one of us has a gift amen so I'm not gonna put my gift in a ground there but nobody know about it and when the Harvest man comes back I want to know what I've done with my gift the Lord I have buried it no when he comes back I want to produce much fruit amen brother Brahm says if a church don't grow spiritually and naturally within three years or a Ministry don't produce naturally and spiritually in three years God is not with administering so we'll walk in the light amen it's a beautiful light praise God and the last thing I would like to say is um we're waiting for the cutout from Brother Stafford about a certain rock group that's here and they telling the guy not to leave in the interval don't live in the interval now I want to tell you don't you want to try and live in the interval because it's only the foolish virgins that lives in the interval [Music] [Applause] so this message is also in the newspaper saying something don't live in the interval now all these things how can the mind take it It could only be God that's all that's what I would like to bring to your mind to do it to do with God and nothing else amen and I'm so glad that I'm to do with him Hallelujah the angel where they swept back way praise God stand there Amen in authority follow the looking down where is my pride Satan I am here now amen nothing you can do [Applause] praise God in authority [Applause] amen nobody can come near her now [Applause] Let The Invasion come but this time he's too late [Applause] we already invaded [Applause] amen said brother Oscar got a problem here I got a problem there amen I don't know if I got the Holy Ghost because I do this wrong and do that wrong that's nothing that's just a leak you're just losing a little Holy Ghost but you've got a Holy Ghost [Applause] and one day in zush Ministry God will show us where to catch up deadly [Applause] and you will sit there and your leak will be patched up and you will wonder where is this problem all the time ahead it'll be gone [Applause] amen so hold on not Moses bride [Music] [Applause] the Chariots are coming the combines are coming amen now there's going to be a split there's going to be a split just before the interval people that don't have the Holy Ghost and a way that's going to stand in the squares they're going to split away from us as one more split coming but that one nobody can stop they're gonna sign on for Rome while we're gonna stay in cuckus squatter camps don't worry what is a beautiful house without God foreign [Applause] [Applause] box plank amen [Applause] oh my God what a day it is so time to go out there in the world no time amen it's time to get pulled up let your cup run over [Applause] I'll listen to a message called The Church choose law for grace and brother Branham says the churches is dead they gone he says but I went the other day to another church he says and I soar while I was preaching the sisters jumping and shouting he says they were on fire for God [Applause] on that tape he says where is the prayer through meetings he says she is gone can she come back again I sat there I said Lord I hope the prophet was in my church to see the shouting and the jumping and the enthusiasm

that's the morning we know about the morning but what about tonight we cannot say how late the day is unless we know the night not Daniel when he preaches us and when he prophesied this and when he brought us to the floor he looked past the curtain of time because this didn't happen in Daniel's time this didn't happen in Jesus time the sexual purpose but he looked right into the interval and he saw these things happening in the interval so brother Branham says on page 93 of seals he says when you preach these things then you will have to go past the curtain of time so what will be business when we preach this we actually went past the curtain of time we fall in time give us time you came here because you were right in the future amen and you are looking down and seeing those things happening because you passed the curtain of time and this message in the interval is actually passing the curtain of time think about it he just didn't come to church Hallelujah Justin Bieber about

And after you tell it on a mountain, tell it on Rosco Hill that Jesus Christ It's born. &gt;&gt; They don't want it. We will have it. Oh my. The greatest time of the year. There is no greater time. This is the only time where a Muslim will bow before the present king. This is the only time that the Jews will close their shops and say going to tell it on the mountain. This is the only time that our tabernacle is not drawn to a Christmas tree, but they chased to the tree of life. Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills. And I say I say everywhere. This is the greatest time of the year when kings get born. &gt;&gt; They get born in palaces. Beautiful garments. That's when kings get born. But this time when a king of king is born is not born in a palace. He's born in a stable. Because he [music] that was rich became poor so that we that poor can become rich. The greatest time of the year. Oh, praise God. So that's why we're going to tell it to the mountains. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you tell it to the mountain, it echoes back. Your voice come back to you that Jesus Christ is born. We don't care when he was born, what month he was born, as long as he was born. Emanuel, God with us. A star led them to the birth of Jesus. They followed the star. The challen wise men follow the star and the star took them to Jesus. Our day, the seventh star took the wise virgins. The wise virgins. I can't hear you. the wine virgin to where Jesus Christ is born. Amen. That's why I go tell it on a mountain over the hills over Edgar Hill Soul Hill. The hills in Bloomington, the hills in Cape Town, the hills in Victoria, the hills in Johannesburg, the hills in Upton, the hills in Abodine, the hills in King Williamstown, the hills in the Cape Province. We can tell it on every hill that Jesus is born. That's why you need to be born again. And to be born again, you need the spirit of God. So Jesus Christ is born. Go tell it on the mountain. And when you tell it on the mountain, let the bride receive her king. Are you ready to receive your king? Let the bride receive a king. For he has come and is born in the joyful atmosphere of El Tabernacle. And when the magi saw him, they were full of joy and they opened their treasures. After opening their treasures, [music] then only they open gold, frankincense and myrr. And they say the gold they brought for ordinary king is more than 5 million rand dollars. And all the gifts that they brought was over a billion rand. When that boy was born, he was born a billionaire. And when Edgar Osco is born, I possess [music] everything BECAUSE WHY? I CAN tell it on the mountain. Hallelujah. Oh, Christmas is a time of giving. We all give and we receive gifts. That's Christmas time when you receive gifts and you give gifts. But what gift did we bring this morning? We need to give him something, too. Hey, what game did we play? [music] This Christmas we give him our gift. What is our gift? The thing that he appreciates.

But we thank the Lord that El Tabernacle &gt;&gt; is not at Bloomfentine or in Estras or in Cape [music] Town. El Tabernacle is at the convention center. I rode in this morning and I saw the sign at the gate and the name is Convention Center. There is no church that has that name, Convention Center. We've come to adore him because the Christ is in our midst. &gt;&gt; Do you believe he's here? &gt;&gt; We've come to adore him. There there's no place this morning Wherever you can go that they adore the Christ like here in El Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; El Tabernacle knows how to entertain, worship, and adore him. And how do we know he's here? Wherever Jesus is, there's a little noise [music] in Tabernacle Convention Center. There's a lot of noise. So let's just give Jesus King gone a shabbak this morning. [music] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you the one next to you can't hear you. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; We received the greatest gift. There is no greater gift that could ever hit the globe, but it hit El Tabernacle. the greatest gift. He's here in our midst. [music] He has come down to deliver his people. Amen. So on behalf of my father the apostle the god that has come down in that body we wish you merry Christmas everyone in our midst this morning it's Christmas in our tabernacle Cool. not in the message in El Tabernacle this morning. [cheering] It's Christmas. And I heard the apostles say, \"There's wise virgins here.\" And wherever they are, &gt;&gt; because they carry the oil, we have come. All of us. All of us. We have come. Herod asks why are you here? They say we have come to worship him. Why are you here all the way on the road? We have come as the wise virgins [music] to worship him. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; We want to thank God's apostle for this convention. We want to thank him that we we all made it. &gt;&gt; When we thought we had a busy year with a man of God preaching almost every week for us, we thought the year's over, but we forgot there's still Christmas. The year is not over yet. The service is not over yet. We still coming back on Saturday because the year is not over yet. It's Christmas. [music] The apostle went over and above to give us the best meal for today and for the convention. Why are we here? Because there's a man that wants us to know it's Christmas. Sister Abigail said the meat is already cooked. This good meat we're going to eat is already cooked. So the food is waiting for us. But we still need to give another Shabbach to the Lord and realize it's Christmas. Amen. We want to thank everybody for the birthday wishes. Brother Katiso, are you here? Where is it? Amen. There. Happy birthday, God. Man from the apostle from El Tabernacle. God bless you. We are happy you in our church. Amen. Stay as sweet as you are. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Then the apostle asked brother Joe, the preacher of Bloomfentine, the apostle said he wants to announce it and I'm going to announce it. He has special gifts that he sells &gt;&gt; and the apostle was so appreciative of that gift. &gt;&gt; So if you see brother Joe, get the gift from him because it's a nice gift. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to have church. Though there be one today, but we're going to have a week full of church. It's convention. And I want to be of them, brother Malcolm. That says I was at the whole convention. &gt;&gt; Amen. When wherever the apostle is, there was a convention. &gt;&gt; Since I know myself in El Tabernacle, I was in a convention. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; So be welcomed. Merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; We waited long for this week. I could see you were under expectation but the services has started. [applause] And in closing, I would like to say to the Jews, a son was born. According to the apostle, if you know, but to El Tabernacle, a son is given. Jesus came down and he lifted me up. So, are we going to kiss the sun? the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The greatest thing that there is. May God bless you, El Tabernacle. Enjoy the fellowship. Enjoy the convention. Enjoy this [music] day. It has started. And may you be merry. Don't be sad. Put a smile on your face and be married. We have God with us. That's why we are here to worship him. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; May God bless you. We can't have all these things if God is not with us. And if you don't believe the man, believe [music] the works. We can't even write down what happened this year. But we believe that if the works [music] testify who is in our midst, let's give the Lord a shabbak. [music] God bless you. And merry Christmas. [music] Amen. You still appreciate our precious pastor Jonathan. Amen. Would love to call up the tithes and the offerings. If the Ashes can just place the tithes if you can remain standing. Jesus, King God, Jehovah Elohim. [applause] Lord, we are grateful and thankful, Father, that we are in you, our house of worship, Lord. [applause] Father, can you heavenly father bless the tithes and offerings, oh Lord, and Lord, bless the hand that gave and that couldn't give, oh Lord, in a merciful and mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just one more time, wherever you are, don't you want to just welcome one another? Just give your neighbor a beautiful hug, a high five, and remind them that it's Christmas. Just say, \"It's Christmas. Tell somebody is Cana. Can you feel it in the air? Joys everywhere.

else like him [Music] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I'm a bit nervous it's actually my first time standing here [Applause] I'd like to share some few testimonies that took place at the University to where I'm studying uh what God has done for us is the young people that side so um it all started in 2019 so 2019 the first brother that came there was uh brother Teng from Springs and uh that's the priority that testified to me as well and then when he came there he said to me my brother I won't stop testifying until the whole future becomes the UL Tabernacle um those words actually came in straight into my heart and that's what I told myself as well is that I won't stop testifying until the whole Beauty becomes the new El Tabernacle [Applause] uh so the first test we actually have a lot of testimonies but uh because of time I'll just say a few that are close to my heart or the ones that threatened me in my faith in L7 naked uh so last year so we were actually at the at the rest is normal so it happened that one of the students there they She fainted and When She fainted now they try to wake her up and then to pour water on here but nothing happened she wasn't waking up and then the rest manager actually he knows what we are Christian so he said no they have to call those guys they have to call those young men's to come and help us and then they call they called us and then we looked at her and then yeah she was not moving nothing and then we went to the study here and we told them that okay everyone must come out and it was only us and the brothers and the and that girl and then we took um we we played an instrument a mystery and then when you play that instrument um we started uh we started praying and then we prayed and prayed and prayed and then I heard they're screaming once and then she woke up and then when we put out actually when we got out to find out that the rest manager was standing at the door his wife was also there all the students were there they even called the ambulance to come and take that girl but when we came out with her she was fine completely fine [Applause] and then yeah it was it was a big scene my brothers and sisters because even those people of the ambulance they didn't know what happened they just too careful test but we went the following day she told us that she was perfectly fine [Applause] um and then the next testimony I would like to share is actually the one whereby um I realized something about this man that we have here the apostol uh is not an ordinary man brothers and sisters now it's not an ordinary man this man doesn't just preach the weight he unknowns the weight I believe everywhere that comes out of the Apostles mouth those words they are anointed I remember this other time I was actually testifying to one see stuff from the University of Pretoria usually here if she's baptized now uh I was just I was testifying to her and I remember this one time I said you know what my sister next time will speak I will be telling you about the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost how do you receive the Holy Ghost and how do you know that you have the Holy Ghost and then I didn't know what where to start I didn't know what to say so I decided to watch the one of the Apostles tape is called how do you know you have the Holy Ghost I actually listened to that tape and I was like saying to myself I'll just get some something then I'll write some few notes and then I found myself writing almost the whole thing and then when I was done I think I had two or three pages and then I called there I said okay now I'm ready my sister and then I started reading what the apostle was saying as I was reading she was aiming but when I was left with a half a page she was crying and I asked myself ah maybe she doesn't like what I'm saying but I continued reading and the time I was almost done she started crying my presence because she cried and now I didn't know what to say anymore because I kept on saying amen my sister amen you know what the Apostle says after the surface that's what I said I didn't know what else to say and then I hanged up the call and then after that I was thinking what just happened and then the thought just hit me and say remember you were fellowshipping about the Holy Ghost and then says if you can speak about the Holy Ghost and nothing happened then you will lie [Applause] and then I realized that actually what I said about the Holy Ghost it is what the apostle was preaching and then the same thing that happened on that tape happened when that Fellowship when I was fellowshipping to her and then as I continued fellowshipping with that girl there was this other day I posted a picture of the Apostle on my status and then I wrote The caption I said The only voice I know and then she replied and said what do you mean I called there and said that's what I mean it's the only voice I know she said to me are you saying that this man is God I said yeah I believe that this man is God [Applause] and then she said to me she said no no no wait wait from the church I am from they are telling me that that man is God so she was from zcc she was saying that man is God I said yeah there are many gods but we don't just want any other court but we want the core of the Bible [Applause] I said um you want the god of Abraham the god of Jacob the god of Isaac that's the god that we are looking for we are not just looking for any other God but we are looking for that God and then I could you took the Bible I said you know what let us put these two Gods on the test you say this man is God I said yeah he's God I'm saying this one is God but let's check which one is the god of the Bible and then I Fellowship to her I told her about Genesis 18 as it was in the days of Lords I told her about the desire of the court of this Bible I told them everything that I know about this God and then after some okay and then it was fine after some few months I think she was in the message there was this other day she was on a call with another sister from nelspruit he says the sister spoke and then she had three voices at the same time she said she was scared now she hanged up the call she called again she had three voices okay she said my sister do you have flu then no I don't have flu but he said hey what's happening now she hanged up the call and then she was sitting on his on her chair and then she says that as she was sitting she saw she saw the Apostle Pastor Jonathan and Pastor Julie's [Applause] and then that's where I found out that I that's why I found out I'm sure even now she knows that there are many chords but we have found the core of the pirate bless your Saints I reach all in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ there's actually a lot of things to say about this ministry uh not knowing where to start because the Lord has done so much for us uh just start by sharing a few testimonies because I'm actually in the University of Johannesburg but I'm working together with the brothers from Val and the president Justified to me is the brother that just spoke we actually come from a place near the border of Mozambique and also Swaziland the reason why we call it nelspade is because I believe that it's a place that many of you are familiar with and um but the name of the place is actually Gomez so by the grace of God in 2019 the brother testified to me I was still doing metric at the time and I remember he went to University at the time and what really took me up by this ministry is that I have known this brother all my life and all of a sudden there was just something different about him I've known him all my life I knew that this Prada we used to do worldly things together but all of a sudden I remember it was during October he told me my brother I found a church and I thought to myself okay you found the church and said to me no but we'll talk when I get there I said no it's fine he came December I remember he started testifying to me and the first time I saw him he was there was just something different about him there was just something about him that I couldn't understand and even the way he spoke the things he was telling me it was things I've never heard before I've been reading the Bible but it was different so now I thought to myself okay this is new and at first I was a bit resistant but the more I spend time with him the more I started to change as well the more I spend time with him the more I something happened to me so by the grace of God I remember the first day he played to me was the mind of Christ and when the apostle was preaching the mind of Christ I remember there's this part where the Apostle says now lay hands on one another and the brother laid his hand on my head I laid my hand on his head I never told him this but it happened after we were done praying he removed his hand and there was just like the palm of his hand there was fire on my head and I said this is God I realized that this is God and since the time I came in it was 2020 it was locked down so we couldn't come to church for two years I couldn't come to church but I was testifying it was just a fire in my soul the things that I heard it was just too much for me and I remember at the church that I was at I remember almost everyone that I got in contact with I told them about the things that I heard I remember at the time it was tips such as uh modern events made clear by prophecy I gave away my wedding comment it was such tips that I told them about that a woman is not allowed to preach it was the basic things things that were supposed to know but for me I remember when I took it I thought that everyone else is going to take it because he this was the truth and I had the mindset that the truth shall set you free I thought that these people were not free so let me go and tell them so that they can be free and by the grace of God uh the whole December so now another story the whole December I remember we were speaking about the apostle and I remember I didn't know him at the time I didn't I it was my first time hearing about this man but there was just something different about him I remember we came to one point we were fellowshipping with the brother the whole December through fellowshipping about revelation 22 16 and he said that no the Apostle is the Angel that's what we had that's the first revelation that we had because the Apostle says you grow in Revelation so we were growing in Revelation you're getting closer and closer and closer so what happened was what happened was um what really shook us is that every time it Fellowship a brother would come in a fellowship the exact same things that he was speaking about so that really shook us but the most remarkable thing is that the whole December through we're speaking about the Apostle being the angel and if you remember Saints the 31st of December 2019 the title of the Apostles message was I sent my angel before you [Applause] so after that I I remember I was supposed to go to university and things didn't work out I believe that God wanted me to stay at home because there were other things that came in during the time testifying and mind you come from a place where at the time there was no deacons no Elders nothing it was only us young people but the tapes kept us alive and I I remember the the statement which Paul made he said I'm uh absent in the flesh but present in the spirit so I think that God was there because he as I said we have a lot of testimonies but because of time we can't share all of them so just going back a bit to what happened this year not very long ago it was last week and last of last week at rest there's a sister from the same rest that I stay at I testified to her last year by the grace of God she got baptized and she's also testifying as well we're winning souls for the Lord so what happened was uh last week we were because sometimes we come together and we have Fellowship so the sister came and there was another soul that she came with and there was another sister which is a message believer she's not in church but she's a message believer so I remember her telling me that I met this other sister but she's a message believer and she said to her that she asked her do you know about El Tabernacle do you know about the Apostle she said she doesn't know anything about that I said it's fine my sister we'll talk about it when we get to the fellowship so we go to the fellowship I remember um as we started fellowshipping and the only thing I could tell her was the quotes of Prada pranam where he speaks about 1946 was the cold weather speaks about that angel he says those seven angels are Earthly Messengers but he says that there's that one angel that will come to announce something he says that there's that one Angel that's gonna come and he's gonna announce something he says that angel is revelation 10. so I was telling the sister about that and as you continued speaking about taking out the quotes and then I started I just drifted I don't know what happened but I just found myself speaking about the jubility how the apostle was raised how he grew up the testimonies he had and all of a sudden uh the sister as I mentioned the sister from rest I won't mention any names but the Holy Ghost fell and she started feeling the Holy Ghost and I could see that the Holy Ghost is falling and not only that since but even the soul that you brought with the soul that she brought with God's slay even the message believer got slain [Applause] and since um even I think last week Wednesday uh before I came to church because I think that Wednesday he was supposed to share this testimony but due to change of plans we had to come today but even that Wednesday before I left I said to the sister my sister can you please all just come together and let's just have a fellowship because I won't be there on Thursday and Friday and she said it's fine my brother we came together and I remember we were fellowshipping the same thing happened the Holy Ghost came down again [Applause] and then now um in closing uh uh as the brother said that um he doesn't believe that the Apostle is an ordinary man and I'd like to say that um I remember when he came in the ministry he used to share his testimonies with me told me you know my brother I had a dream about the apostle but I think that with me and as I mentioned that I only came to church after two years with me I wasn't that much bothered with not dreaming about the Apostle I believe that God comes to all of us in a different way and with me there was just something different there's just this feeling that I get whenever I the the angel of the Lord is there and there's even the sister from nelspruit the brother mentioned about her that sister can attest to that I remember there was this one time I went to where she stays and we had a fellowship I told her my sister connect the angel of the Lord is here and all of a sudden the sister started feeling the angel of the Lord the Holy Ghost was present so the last testimony I remember there was this other sister I was testifying to we used to go to the same school together but I take her as my little sister and this sister I remember we spoke and over the phone he was speaking and I was sharing to her about um uh what I was listening to because we only had tapes and there was some brothers that used to Fellowship to us another product from secunda so I was listening to a tape and I remember at the time if my memory says me correctly I remember it was uh the revelation of Hell and its Dimensions part two and I remember I was sharing to the sister about that um tape and all of a sudden the sister was responding but something happened and as the sister there was a moment where the sister got silent and I but I could also feel that the Holy Ghost came and all of a sudden I just heard the sister Scream the Holy Ghost came into the room she was speaking over the phone so I felt that the Holy Ghost was present and believe you're saying this this was happening even before I got baptized I only got baptized in 2021 February but then it was still 2020 and every time it Fellowship the Holy Ghost would come down [Applause] so now this is the when she screamed and she fell down on the floor and as I said I was worshiping I just put the phone down I started worshiping and all of a sudden as the Holy Ghost began to subside and then the the sister came to me uh she came back on the phone we started speaking again and then she told me brother you won't believe what happened I I said to her my sister what do you mean she said to me uh something just happened she said to me when I screamed uh uh my sibling came into the room and asked me if I'm fine and she said uh to The Sibling no it's fine you can go out and The Sibling left the room close the door she said she felt as if a door was opening again and when she looked the door was closed and she said that the thing is with her door when you open it it makes a noise she said that she felt a presence in a room once you fill that presence in the room she said when she looked up she saw a light and that light changed into a figure and the figure was a man wearing a white suit and she said the man wearing a white suit was the Apostle at the hill roster foreign amen let's give him a hand of Praise amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

when I heard having kidney stones my mind shot the devil shot me with something I wonder if it's not that kidney and when he found me I said Edgar don't worry there's nothing wrong with your kidneys

said that I am uh going to count U the restoration of the Gloria and um the veterans that's there will be bringing back the restoration of the Gloria so I am not against that I just want to show in this in this video clip that I'm going to play to you that the restoration didn't take place and I just want show you that for 40 years up till now after the 20 um 2024 restoration of the Glorious meetings it's not back in any other Church what you're going to see here so I want to say this that I am not fighting this anymore because Monday my whole perspective changed as said we believe what we believe and Abigail your father believes what he believes we don't see what your father sees and your father don't see what I see that settled it for me because a thing that had me all was Ezekiel when you see somebody do wrong and you don't straighten him out he's blood is on your hands and that was since a young man that he had me that's why I was so bold but I told God now that thing is off me now everybody sealed in and everybody believed what they believe so I will not be going into these things anymore as far as speaking about their beliefs they can chop me with my beliefs it's fine I think I'm big enough to take it as I said with George Martin I'm not going to mention him again and I could have I could have blasted them now with a split you know but it's not my business that's their business they got to go on I must say that I had some people that went to the breakup Church of George Martin and U they did report back to me I I went as far as that you know I just wanted to know if I'm right so uh I hope that you're honest brother brandham says the gospel trumpet is blowing and it's the good news and it says the good news is the Holy Ghost is here he says how do we know it's yeah you watch how it works its manifestation and then he mentions one of the things which the other things I'll mention with my next message um one of the things it brings back is honesty to be honest so uh if the Holy Ghost is y back we're going to have honesty and I just want to be honest you look at deog Gloria what is deog Gloria you young guys you know and see if it going to ever be able to hand over de Gloria to you young guys thank you and I'm not fighting H you can come behind me and write me and say what you want to after this tap I'm finished I'm not going to answer you we cannot leave you and listen in 1983 84 when it happened in de Gloria it's in shock waves around the world that bright stirring it stirred the world Listen young people you may not realize this what happened here in South Africa and mind you Kimberly bar is actually the center of South Africa few kilometers down the road there's a pole there they believe that's the center of South Africa so God chose the center of South Africa C the bride here to meet us here to have literal they seen the fire the fire fell people were slain anointed filled with the Holy Ghost amen and uh it went around South Africa around Africa it hit America they took it back South America Allelujah Europe amen Germany all places of the world Amen the anointing from de Gloria went is that right by the way it went around the world from here so we are happy we're not bragging but we're happy to say God chose us we represent the Bride of South Africa we representing the bride and Africa we're representing the bride around the world this morning as God saw it fit to start here with the outpouring of the Holy Ghost unprecedented anointing that happened here in 84 unprecedented aen the world that to recognize that what can we say my God Amen a brother in my church had a dream on December 2nd that twice a Thursday and December uh 1st and he had a dream that uh it was in a like a like a hot place and brother Musgrove brother rusco and myself were there was very warm like South Africa or the tropics he and there he was sealed which was back in New York and he said but there he was seal and he seen the cloud and Three Angels like like smoke coming down here they are amen and it had the dream two times and charity poured out at the last day the holy spirit is here now and God has confirmed it what can we say bless the Lord the eyes that see and the ears that hear we are here we are here we are here praise God Amen now you have heard what brother woman said the Gloria actually didn't just start it started with a dream a vision that um brother mazov myself and brother Coleman uh was in the tropics hot place de your Gloria as brother Coleman was saying and uh Three Angels dropped down and and he showed you the photo now if you can make up your mind this is what bog Gloria is brother colan and myself mainly brother mazra wasn't here in 83 I think and 84 he came I think and um then we were together but the thing started with brother colan and myself that is the Gloria by a vision that's why we had the meetings there you can make up your own mind what you think it is the Angel was first cited at El Tabernacle in Johannesburg before the Deo Gloria convention in this video brother Coleman clearly experienced his first genuine touch during a significant outpouring of the Holy Spirit following this sister's testimony she shared her encounter with the mighty angel of God during another meeting in Johannesburg sister bapsy was the first witness to confirm that the Angelic visitations did not begin at the Deo Gloria convention instead she had multiple encounters with the angel while staying with the late sister Moses in Johannesburg see aen from Johannesburg she has a testimony that Sheen the angel of [Applause] the you say but brother can we see angels listen your man read the book of Acts in the book of Acts there was Angels te in all chapter and the Heart being rest back it's Angel time again um again I don't have to explain anything here brother Owen was interpreting the sister with cut off the the tape it's on tape we have it on the other tape and um he uh interpreted it and said well the angel was first seen in Johannesburg before de Gloria I don't have to say much and I don't want to say much so you make up your mind and you believe what you want to believe but this is de Gloria I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ I've never ever experienced the supernatural yet until this morning I was just sitting there and a sister came up and she gave her testimony that she seen an angel I was sitting there I just raised up my hand closed my eyes just to worship and through my closed eyes behind OE I saw I saw a big guy standing behind him standing Head and Shoulders above him dark colored long hair [Applause] [Music] Barefoot now after sister bubs on on the tape has testified and own testified um while she was there there that same angel that sister BB was speaking about and uh brother Owen was speaking about brother sh saw him on the platform and he gave a testimony yeah and um I just like the way brother Becket was actually aiming uh uh brother Schubert on this very issue here you know if you have if you have the tape you can just rly back and you'll see brother back at at the back there shouting amen hallelujah so that big Angel was prevalent and present right after Bubsy has testified about the angel being in Johannesburg first so you make up your mind what you believe and then I just want to interject here why we um I'm playing this so that you can say don't come from me now the angel of the Lord was first saw in 1979 in Johannesburg then I never told Brother K nothing then we had the coronationville uh Crusade with brother Coleman when he came and he saw that angel and his presence then Coleman called me one side it's like brother Vick said the behind the scenes things then he says brother Rosco when did this happen so I said no October month it happened and then uh brother Becka came and asked me to dedicate his church and I prayed because I didn't know if this was right or wrong and I told the Lord if this Holy Ghost Falls in brother becket's Church then I will never side away from it I said brother Coleman then it did fall in Becka church we have the video of it and uh from Beckett's church then coronation happened where the same thing happened and the people that stayed around the coronationville hall saw smoke coming out and they found the police so the Holy Ghost came down 1979 before deog Gloria 5 years before the GL de Gloria meetings or 4 years before the Gloria meetings all all depends if you take it 83 or 84 and then I want to remind you we're going to play a small Club of 1981 in P Elizabeth when brother Coleman came up and um what happened there so we just want to show you how the Holy Ghost got a hold of brother Coleman when when it was said about the angel of the Lord in [Applause] Johannesburg the mechanics back charity we pray this morning dear God May the young people may you smile upon the testimony may you see them [Applause] away Oh Glory [Applause] Glory Hallelujah HJ receive now here again this is the glory where ministers receive the Holy Ghost now where are we going to have meetings like this yeah brother Coleman the one who brought the Thunders the originator of the seventh Thunder Seven Virtues got so full of the Holy Ghost that he danced and I also got the Holy Ghost there and Owen and them said they got the Holy Ghost there and we'll show you just now brother SMY of Sanai how he got the Holy Ghost there now do glorious to do not only with the people but with ministers receiving the Holy Ghost so you make up your mind and think are they going to get restored back here and we will play just now what own said 40 years it's gone we'll say something on that I like to feel the Angels behind me I want of feel the seven angels in [Applause] them I want to feel the waves of Glory coming from behind me and from in front of me the last time I was on this platform I preach to seven Thunders I thought I was in the graveyard but this time I feel like I'm in glory [Applause] no more graveyard the seven sons is not [Applause] dead now again it raises question marks it was said that the the seven Thunder inspiration brought the Angels but here brother Coleman says when it came that was 1981 brother own is sitting right at the back in P yeah you know and just before that he came from Johannesburg so he said the first time he came and preach the seven Thunders graveyard now how could brother Coleman that preach the seven Thunders say he came to a graveyard when he came but now you feel the angels of the Lord behind it because he preached in Johannesburg in 1979 when the Angels Came now you make up your mind because you sure heard that they say the seventh Thunders uh uh uh inspiration 7th 7 inspiration brought the Gloria the says when he came it was a graveyard it was a graveyard and it was a graveyard it was a graveyard but when he came 79 he told is going to take this South African worship and it was not South African worship 79 it was El tacle worship and it's still Al Tabernacle worship back to New York City and then what did Joey sing No American SP what initiated in the Gloria or in Johannesburg so that whole thing falls through the Met because Coleman says when he came it was a graveyard he preached and he tried to preach the seven Thunders you make up your mind everybody I I'm I got to the place now that um I really appreciate what brother said you know your father believe what he believes and we believe what we believe believe you know so we see it different than what he's seen it and he see it different than what we see it I have come to the conclusion of that I am not going to fight anymore because I believe we're all sealed off in what we believe there won't be anymore speaking about seventh and Seven Virtues if you believe it it's up to you but I am this video just to show you what the Gloria is all about and you know I can't say much because Jean already blasted the thing you know and real bad so I'm not going to blast this thing I just want to show the young guys like Vic said we're going to hand over the pattern now what type of a b are you going to hand over with what brother Owen says there was a law for 40 years yes so we don't just want the word restored we want the power restored we want the Holy Ghost restored we want the supernatural restored amen hallelujah went through aoud and so forth 40 years and it's still AOW after now we don't have this that we see in here on this video it's only seen in alter anle and I'm sorry to say so if it hurts you I'm sorry but it is a truth that it's only only found in Al anle that angel never left us it's still here so I am not fighting I am showing the young guys the truth [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] refilling all the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord reform me tonight bre for me tonight Lord God give me a brand new touch tonight Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen Lord here am I do not pass me Lord while on other th calling do not pass me by Lord I need a touch from you tonight Lord I'm feeding that Camel Lord I want to write it now I want to write it Lord I want to write it I want to write it [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah the angel of the Lord is in the camp he's here as brother Brenham says in God's Eagles he stands next to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you okay now this is been Harris in October month before de Gloria and here we already speaking about the angel before the Gloria you know so the problem is is now was the angel first saw in deog Gloria or long before theog Gloria because this is not P Harris before the Gloria October 83 this happened in the states and there's the same Angel the same worship so how come it is not here now and it's not it's not in the Gloria point one and it's not in pen Harris anymore and I want to say this I'm sorry to say it is it because Edgar Rosco left and I'm going to play you a clip of our December convention and even the last combined meeting where everybody saw on Saturday how the Holy Ghost poured out with nobody in the pit no band playing nothing just the angel of the Lord moving for over an hour on the people so it sto with us it left Coleman it left pen Harris it left um uh uh uh de Gloria and I'm quoting brother Omen pal which he honestly said for 40 years and it is 40 84 to 2004 is 40 years judgment No Angel no Holy Ghost no pouring out like this whatsoever so you make up your mind again I am not fighting you know any fool can see it black and white I got all the tapes I got all the tapes you know and I got all the full tapes I'm just playing you little shots because we're handing over the Batton to the young guys they must see what the pattern is that they need to run with this is the pattern [Applause] [Applause] oh [Applause] what can we say Amen the intelligence is here that's not a man that's the Holy Spirit that's here now amen praise there was a binding spirit in here the there was a hole in back and God used his servant to bust a thing it's free now Glory the Holy Spirit has now to baptize you tonight amen praise God I feel the same anointing that was in Holland Saturday night is here now it's only 8:25 this may be your day this may be your night oh hallelujah praise God that same God that came down in the upper room on 120 Souls that same holy spirit is here tonight praise God to seal your way into the kingdom of God don't you back up now come on praise God Press Your Way Hallelujah glory to God praise His Wonderful Name the holy spirit is here oh praise God hallelujah my my let's have a word of prayer almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ we pray for them now father this is the Holy Ghost night there's many in here that want to be married to the lamb Glory let us be glad let us rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb is come amen and father in order to be wife we have to have an experience oh

hallelujah that they might be ready for the call to the mar supper Glory let us be glad and rejoice praise God God for many shall be sealed in the name of Jesus Christ we ask a blessing amen and amen Oh [Applause] [Music] Glory my let me share something with you with the Saints down in Guyana in Bur beast and how they I thank God for this little group holding out they don't want none of those pastors coming around that's against the Thunders and so forth they want brother Brown's message precious brother in Christ God bless you and greetings to you the past and all the Believers in the the name of the Lord Jesus Christ trus in the Lord that you and all the other Bethlehem dwellers from the local Christian Assembly are pressing towards Perfection praise God no Pastor last week we had a combined Fellowship service with both groups of Believers here in furnish uh furnace a furnish we listen to the marriage of the Lamb by God servant brother rasal before the message even was through the Believers went on for hours watering the camel brother rasco's message way down in Guyana South America my praising God for ours on on their knees we raise up from our knees with a new vision and a determination to press with all our might to Perfection God is already here that Joseph is here I got refilled brother we are convinced we heard straight from the Throne of God our lives have changed we can never ever be the same everyone is desperate and now on expectation waiting for his or her day to be sealed away the season is here and no devil can stop us so what can I say this is before de Gloria and the angel of the Lord was here and went down to guania and Bless the people for hours there so how could de Gloria produce the angel of the Lord and from the Gloria around the world how can it be here it is before the Gloria and uh I clearly remember how dead this meeting was in penis like brother Coleman said again this is a seventh Thunder meeting and it was dead at a breakthrough and it wasn't the first time twice it happened in colan's church that the church was dead and it took me 6 minutes for the Holy Ghost to come down and visit and then keman came back in in in in in Flores Hill and said this place was dead you can put brother Rosco in a graveyard when he start praying and preaching the dead will rise up and say Amen because we couldn't move you guys here again in pen Harris it was dead that's com's own words then who brought this Angel there again before the Gloria and that angel went right down to guania the same Angel before de Gloria now that's why I said you make up your mind am I lying colan lying or was it lies last year in the Gloria 2024 who was it lies who who's lying I leave it to you I'm not I'm not perturbed anymore because I don't want to speak about these things anymore like I said I finished with George Mar I don't speak about him I never spoke about him again even if you had that big big a breakup and the things those people are saying the same people that was against me and wrote all that commments against me was the same people that's now Downing George Martin so I don't have time for these people they now with you tomorrow they dump you like a hot potato the way they dump brother tum down there I don't even have to go into that so again this is the Gloria the Gloria was still going on before theog Gloria and after deog Gloria we still have a de Gloria in Al Tabernacle and everybody knows that you make up your mind I don't care anymore we believe what we believe and Abigail your father believe what he believes you know so there's where we are now we're all sealed in and what we believe everybody's sealed in on what he believe we'll see when we get Yonder who was right and who was wrong if I'm wrong I'm gone so you make up your mind I'm playing you the videos I got all these videos and I mean by now Raymond must know that I'm sitting with all the old radio or all the old uh uh tapes so I can go scratch them out whenever I want to if I want to know what rock um brother um uh Mike and them when they were with us and Monty what they said way back there I just going to take the tapes out and I can play it so that they can hear with their own words but now you have 2024 theog Gloria and you have that words and now you have these words you can pay it up it's not my business anymore you know I told every girl after I heard well we believe what we believe you believe what you believe that settled it for me even if I catch a pastor in bed with a woman I'm not going to say anything I'm going to walk on Hallelujah the angel is here now close your eyes and say Lord seal me Lord Fill Me This Is Your Night this is the visitation 1983 GL Hallelujah the angel of God himself is here hallelujah Glory hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] Jesus Loves [Applause] Me we pray this morning de God young people when you smile upon the testimon hands when you see them [Applause] awaiting was the Lord all the [Music] time he was [Applause] there all the waiting patiently so patiently and [Music] love he was there [Music] the he was [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there praise [Applause] God and something told a brother to take another snap and he snapped to the sky there right here we have all the ministers that receive the holy ghost in the Gloria from that angel now why am i showing you this because this is what the Gloria is all about not only the people receiving the Holy Ghost the ministers from Goldman down if that don't get actually Revisited again then you can't have a restoration and the question comes the people is asking now why did it leave for 40 years why is this not seen nowhere in the world but in E Tabernacle I don't know it's up to you and my Congo Brothers you cross from me because I said the Holy Ghost left what did I mean by the Holy Ghost left this is what the Holy Ghost was all about this happened at Coleman de Gloria class room right in bis's church and across the world this is what happened but I don't see this no more so did hlyh leave if you don't see this anymore look at how many ministers here is drunk under the Holy Ghost where did you see this this needs to be restored how can we restore this if you don't have the right guys to build a Revival on you know what brother Braham says God get a man and he prepares him to build a Revival on him you know you need the man that God buil the Revival on and the moment of that left 84 then the whole thing fell into chaos according to brother Owen Palm 40 years and I thinkk Owen because he's honest okay I hope you not know what's handing over the pattern of the Glory it's a hell of a big beton it comes from a vision then into a classroom then into uh brother becket's church then into um the coronation convention then into the PE convention and America you know that is the Gloria that's the glory of God you can't have this I I agree with Jean you know we don't agree on a l of things but when he said this is not going to come back I agree with him so I believe what I believe you believe what you believe that is now the Criterion out Tabernacle we have come to a place that brother said you believe what you believe and I believe what I believe I want to see ministers being slain like this the last time I saw it was 50 to 100 ministers in Brazil with B this thing happened in the temp praise God you can be baptized with the Holy Ghost you can be sealed away Hallelujah you can grab a hole of the altar tonight praise God Amen Hallelujah Lord God my all is on the alt I'm waiting for the fire waiting waiting for the fire all over this place the angel of the Lord is seeing hallelujah praise God Amen hallelujah praise God the young people are sing outside praise God God is busy moving like a magnet [Music] [Applause] hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God the fir of God is here tonight oh Hallelujah the angel of God is here [Applause] hold on hold on don't let go tonight I will not let you go I will not let you go until you bless me praise God hallelujah hallelujah so Hallelujah s Hallelujah forever [Music] I pray your visitation of the angel in South Africa here he is Glory brother brandham did not have to come back the angel has come back himself Glory that angel is here now Glory he's sealing the people Glory you begin to pray Lord seal me Lord seal my children father don't let them so here we have The Minister's wives under the Holy Ghost I'm not speaking about the congregation I'm not speaking about I'm speaking about the ministers and the ministers wives that got folded up where is that is that going to come back you know I agree with you brother John I'm sorry I don't agree with you with many things but this is something different than anything else and the big question is why did it leave why did it leave brother Coleman why did he leave the seven Thunders why did he leave South Africa this very thing that started in South Africa it's up to you again to make up your mind no more me the precious of me me I'm going to have a good time after this and I'll believe that you can believe even a Jehovah Witness Doctrine and I told God I'll speak about it very very soon all the power of God is all over the place hallelujah thank God for anointed Minister amen edar Rosco do you know what edar means Ed means protector of property Hallelujah he is protecting the property of God you are God's Property he is protecting you that's why he's blasting you that's why s I'm hitting you hitting you hitting you [Applause] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus after I came back from Johannesburg brother sister Hallelujah the very first the very first uh day after been back we had our Wednesday night service and I related to the dear ones what has happened what God is doing on the land brother sister you know what happened this Sunday morning after I came from the cross of Amen coming to preach the word of the Lord there was no time to preach amen hallelujah the Holy Ghost strike that place until the worship went on for three solid hours no time to preach the worship went on for 3 hours listen this is the hour for God's power and for the manifestation Hallelujah [Applause] Jesus loves [Music] me yes now yeah here we have brother theck and you might make out what he meant by saying those words he came from the r which is Johannesburg and he experienced it in Johannesburg not de Gloria Johannesburg now who's lying am I lying but fine you know this tape will be played at electron judgment to show where the thing actually happened and here brother even brother minty they lays on the floor he also as a minister received the Holy Ghost where are we going to have those days 40 years those days was gone and I stress it why did it leave Coleman pan Harris and de Gloria for 40 years why never again did they see this you know everybody says brother Oscar because you left and that's the truth I left 84 and from 84 there was nothing going on I went back after I went up there to brother um uh in Canada brother Ed bisco and uh I preached there and the Holy Ghost fell until 1:00 in the morning and uh I first went around there to Coman and them and when I sat there I told my wife she's gone she's gone and it was nothing there when we got up to to uh uh uh Canada there she was again so I'm asking you this is what the people pick up because it's all I got that of of what have happened in in Canada I got it on tape too you know we'll play it sometime and uh the same thing happened there a de Gloria happened there after years after de Gloria so now the problem again is why did it leave why is it gone what type of Aon are we leaving for the young men so young men if you don't see this then you don't have a restoration of the glor Ever from the vision of Ken who will be in the Gloria and it was proven by Three Angels you know so it will never be proven again thank you there brother I started tape service bruty I hired the hall I paid the sign the lease I bought the real and I picked up the people and started tape Services now I don't want to argue about who bought the reals Raymond all that I ask tell me from who did you buy the reals please don't make a mistake here from who did you buy the reals like you say I would like to know now remember Raymond I know the history of ative so don't make a mistake here from who did you buy the reals that's all that I want to know and then also even if you did that this is the quote that I would like the people to read brother say God don't work through Mechanical Devices he use human instrumentality we put tears that quot so it don't help us to go against the prophet you can't put a tape recorder on the street corner and expect people to come in people never came in with a tape recorder people came through human instrumentality just like God's Prophet said so I don't even want to query and argue that because s renica told me the same thing that you bought the reals and I knew it was not sold and all that I ask just tell us from who did you buy the real and as I was saying here is the two sets of tapes that I bought for Al Tabernacle she always had two sets of tapes now if Raymond had bought tapes where is he set this first set is still here that was totally hopeless that V done in the early couple of years of making tapes we only got fter tapes late when I bought the second for e e tacle so if he bought tapes for E tle where is the tapes I'm the pastor of el Tabernacle I know no tapes Raymond that you bought I was here before you point number one point number two Raymond I am the pastor and not you point number three I am your brother-in-law I frequent your house for many years I never saw a set of brother brandham stes in A's house never so I don't know what you're talking about but don't make a mistake remember the real to reals came out before the cassetes you said real to real I just want to know that because that will be my last encounter with you with a real to real and a real to real big tape that tape was so big I'm not speaking about a small tape recorder I'm speaking about the big one the real to real tapes with the real to reals I want to know where did you buy it from the reals and um that's why when they wanted to destroy the cassette tapes I said no leave it it might come up as witness one day and I never thought that will come up now after Sor reica said you said then I remembered I still have the tapes I still have the tapes now any common sense any person that's honest any real end time believer will automatically think if El tacle had two sets of tapes one from V and one filed why why did they need another one from Raymond Thompson that means we should have had three sets of tapes here you never had a set of tapes at home never a full set never I frequent your house so I'm not going to query that you can say you had but just tell me about the real to real so that I can tell the world because they're going to immediately know who's lying you on me from who did you buy the real to real as you said here now I was the pastor of el Tabernacle the next thing I want to ask you if you were so great with the tapes who stopped the tape you you were the the the maduna I sto that tapes I stopped the tape meetings you know why didn't you go on with the tape meetings because I was a pastor and I put a stop to it and I know why because I spoke with I think George vuk and we checked something out and we realize it doesn't work nobody got saved there wasn't one tape meeting that we had where where we LED somebody to the Lord not one so don't come and boast on things that is invalid tapes don't work yeah yeah they're trying push and tape it's not working why are you always busy brother Rayman with things that falls to the med always I'm not fighting I'm asking and uh you know uh the reason I just have to explain what is happening why are we having this convention you know I think it was about two years ago me and pastor and spoke and he just spoke that he says he wants to host a convention where all the young ministers can preach you know so I thought to myself you know the young ministers will always be there but I mean the elderly ministers we don't know how long we'll still have them with us so this convention we decided that we want all the veterans to preach to us at this convention okay uh brother Tim Timothy said that Raymond is initiated this convention and again another flop another flop because brother R comes back he says so happy is here de Gloria blah blah blah blah but he is happy because of a flop now how many times must a man flop pure flock that every minister is talking about this flock and he don't stop and the people still follow him I can't go on with this anymore as I said he believes what he believed and I believe what I believe zedekiah also believed that he's got a Holy Ghost and Mah don't have so I rest myself from now onwards with this but I still want to hear where you bought not the cassette the real to real tapes where did you buy it from Raymond don't make a mistake here thank you oh take my life take my thoughts Lord I don't want to worry about anything oh fill me with your Holy Spirit father fill me with your spirit Lord Lord We Worship You We Praise You Lord sweep over my soul Spirit of the Living God for fresh on me today Lord Break Me Lord melt me Lord fill me with your spirit Lord [Music] hallelujah oh Hallelujah GL to God thank you Jesus

good news it's good news it's good news the news are good good [Applause] he w oh w w [Applause] we I showed you exactly the same is still happening in Al Tabernacle without doubt here it is and um I want to say now that um this you'll never find in since Raymond Thompson left and split my church as he had it in his lawyer's letter when he left in ' 87 from that time till now Raymond you never had this up till now you don't have this so nobody has this but El EO only want to be honest if that was the angel and it's still here that means the angel is only in E Tabernacle visible and manifested yeah I brought out a quotation where brother brandham says the good news is the Holy Ghost is here there's the Holy Ghost nobody actually pumping nobody in the pit no musicians amen and here's the Holy Ghost here's the quote here's the manifestation you cannot argue it and nobody in the world can argue it it's still here so I thank you it's your problem now to work out who lied I want to also just put down here remember brother B say what make the people dance what make the people shout what he says a supernatural being in them you don't have to pump you don't have to ask please clap your hands please shout like you guys do in the Thunders say Amen say this you know it must be an automatic thing like in Al Tabernacle they shout because brother Braham says something tickles their nervous system to yell out and scream you don't have to whoop it up God pushes it out of the people automatically and that you only find in alter eckle everybody asked for a hand clap shout and all that that's not the Holy Ghost this is the Holy Ghost thank you I'm [Music] finished is Tru still [Music] Mar Satan triy is best to block it but there's no power on Earth that can stop it TR [Music]

We um want to greet everybody in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We have um set this thing out to do this clip and um for tabernacle we have mentioned it as we're going to have these this meeting on the 10th of October Friday night and um we thought that we'll just put out this clip so that um uh our church around South Africa could uh get ready for this meeting. So, um we're just going to have um a little talk around it. to um actually sketch a picture of um this meeting. I'm quite excited um to actually uh preach it and go into it and um I know it is going to be a tremendous blessing to um to uh this part of the bride of Jesus Christ and a person can only do what's in your theophony and uh I believe that this message is certainly something that's been laid in me before the foundation of the world to bring out and preach. So let us go into it. &gt;&gt; Thank you apostle. Thank you for your time. and we let go. &gt;&gt; So agree the church and the saints at large. May God bless you. Um thank you for your time, Apostle. Apostle Mike, first question is that I see you are preaching a lot around Matthew 25. What is the reason? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, a good a good question. Um it's uh it's special to me. I preach on it 13 years ago and I must mention uh Edgar uh that it didn't go well in the message when I preach it and um I got a little bit of stick for preaching it and um 30 years ago Huh? Because the majority of the message believe it was Pentecost is a foolish virgin. And um but going through it, you know that the spirit of God speaks to preachers. He showed me that it isn't and that the foolish virgin is in the bride and not Pentecost. And because um they went on that brother Brandham seemingly has shown to the Pentecostals, you know, but there's a lot of things that brother Brandham dropped that clearly indicated to me 30, 40 years ago that is in the message and uh in question and answers. He says um the foolish virgin is closer home than what we think. And uh that actually stirred my curiosity that uh Pentecost is not closer home. It's not here near us. We're miles apart. And then I could see that brother Brham was showing where the foolish virgin is going to be. And uh then he says in the 10 virgins she's a virgin. You can only be a virgin through the word. and Pentecost don't have the word so they aren't and will never be a virgin and brother B says both of them are virgins you know and that further showed me that the only virgins you are going to get will be in the message then it says she is so close it will deceive the very elect if it's possible and he makes the sister read the scripture Matthew 24:24 so another point that it could not be Pentecost another point that it clearly shows it's in the message so close Pentecost cannot deceive us. Their mouths apart. You know, you just look at a woman and you know they're not close. So that's another point that shows that it is not Pentecost but in the message the foolish virgins is amidst us. She and the wise recognized the same voice Malachi 4 and woke up. Pentecost don't recognize brother Brandham's voice. They're not under that voice. So that is another point that it can't be Pentecost but message. They all press and play. They know the voice of the of the of the of the messenger. And that's another point, a proven point, a solid point to show that it is not Pentecost. They're in the message. right here with us. So um and uh brother Bham says in question and answers if you know what watch that voice came it was not in the first watch it was in the seventh watch go meet the bridegroom. So that voice is a seventh angel's voice which is brother Brham and Pentecost don't recognize that voice. So it is a clear indication that the foolish virgins is amidst the bride. Then um it says that they all woke up to trim their lambs. The wise and the foolish got up and trimmed their lamps. Now the lamb we all know the psalm writer says the word of God is a lamp unto our feet. So the lambs is the word of God. So all of them had the word of God and the word of God in the seventh watch is the message of the hour and they all had the same lamps which they all were under the same ministry of the seventh angel. So um it is another point that makes it more at home than anywhere else. We should not even look at a Pentecostals or anybody else. Those guys are here. Another place brother says the hypocrites. They act as if they are, but they not. They act as if they are bride, but they're not. And that's hypocrisy. That's the reason when you look at them, you can just see it's a facade. It's a put on, you know, and that's another point. And brother Brandham goes on in the 10 virgins. He said she preaches the word you know same he said same like the wise virgin. So they had the same word they all they press and played you know and they said the same thing preached the same thing. Brother Brandon says, \"So Pentecost don't preach the same message we preach.\" So again, it's a proven fact that they write here amidst us. And um the prophet says she had everything. The wise virgin had everything. She believe in the blood. She believed in sanctification. Brother Bland says she believe in the atonement. She preached the word. She preached justification. She preached a healing. All the same. And she had a clean life. Brotherson, her life was as clean as a whistle. He says you couldn't put your finger on a life. That means when a guy don't live a life, you can put your finger on him. according to 10 virgins. But with a foolish virgin, you can't you couldn't even do that. She was just as clean as the wise virgin. They had everything the same. But brother Abraham says the only difference between the two was the oil, the quickening power, the good news that the Holy Ghost is here. That was the only difference. All right. &gt;&gt; So now if we look in here and we look at them then or in a message you have to look where the oil is because the oil determines whether she's bride or not bride because she's got the lamp. She's already got the mechanics, but she don't have the dynamics. So, you don't have to worry about the word because she's in the word. But what brother says, I don't care about the word, the mechanics, push and play. I'm worried about the dynamics that must come onto the mechanics. So when you are in a end time church, if you're vigilant, then you will look for a church that has the dynamics and the mechanics. I think in question and answers, he also say uh uh he also says um um he likes a church that's full of the Holy Ghost, you know. So what make them foolish is that they know they don't have it and yet they go on which is foolish. It's like somebody tells you don't smoke, you're going to get cancer and you go on smoking. Is that intelligence? It's not. And uh then what comes to being is what brother Brandham says in Daniel 70 weeks. My wife's quote, she used to like it and she always used to tell me, Edgar, this people is willfully blind. You know it's it's not that they are naturally they like what Africans word says as they're going to show you're going to stay in this message under this pastor regardless if he's wrong. So that makes them fools and um because a real Brian member will look at the thing and say this is not right. So, I'm not going to be a fool to follow this thing because this thing ends up in the third dimension of hell. So, foolishness is brought in Matthew 25. And uh what I would like to bring out the Bloom team is they foolish and foolish is to know the truth but you still go for error. You're a fool, you know. So you can look around. I'm sorry to say this and I don't mean to be ugly. How many fools have you got in this message that knows the truth and go against it with everything in you? How could you get u Matthew 25 which is prophetic? It is the coming of the Lord. And in that coming the groom tells you what I want from you is oil to come in here. The Holy Ghost I want you to have my spirit. And I could never understand it when we were with brother Coleman those years. We we would like to quote this quote out of question and answers where brother B says the foolish virgin rejected the atonement in its fullness. I could never splice it. I could never ever get my thoughts around it. But now going back into it, I realize that the oil is a seven spirits and seven church ages. It's a baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; So the statue of a perfect man is the full atonement. It's the whole blood. Brother Abraham says the token could only come at the end. Why? Because those seven bloods then came and made the token, the full atonement and they rejected it right at the time of the coming of the broom. Now you want to be bride, you have to be under subjection to the groom. And what the groom wanted was oil to enter in the Holy Ghost. and they rejected it. This message, nobody can come sit in front of me and say they didn't reject it. Nobody. They had many things to say about it. It's hogwash. It's Pentecostalism. It's it's emotions. They just tag everything on it that's ugly. and it became the rejected stone. But I thank God that there was somebody in South Africa that when we go pick up that rejected stone and today they all wanted after fighting all those years today they want it and they don't have it. It's like I told brother Owen Palmer I says Owen just be honest tell me where can I find the Gloria where they preach on it the Holy Ghost but there's no glory nothing there's no atmosphere nothing and yet we want to later on preach on the gospel or what brother mention what the gospel is and where he says that um um the Holy Ghost is the main main thing greater than the word greater than press and play because the Holy Ghost brought press and play the word. So, brother Bam says it's greater than he quotes the scripture of uh speaking against the word, you'll be forgiven. He said, but speaking against the Holy Ghost, no forgiveness. He says that's the greatest. And that's the reason we call this the greatest sermon. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because we busy with the greatest thing. And um uh we want to preach later on on um um the working of the Holy Ghost. Not the Holy Ghost. After you have the Holy Ghost, where's the working of the Holy Ghost? Some places they call it the acts. acting, you know, how did you act when you received the Holy Ghost, you know, so we can Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, but you need the working of the Holy Ghost. If you say the Holy Ghost is here, let us see in your church how does it work. You find people say, \"Okay, let let us worship God.\" And the pastor goes there and he blah blah blah, you know, he's the alpha, he's the omega, he's the beginning, he's the end, and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. And the church also go when he say amen, it stopped. That's not Bible worship. Bible worship you find when the uh tabernacle was dedicated. The Bible says the glory of the Lord came in and the ministers couldn't minister. You know, you can just stand there and the Holy Ghost pours out. That's Bible worship, you know. And uh when the minister's finished blah blah blah blah and the alpha and omega and all that, you know, when he's finished with that, then ship, it's cut off. No feeling, no atmosphere, no pull. And when you take that back to the Bible, you don't find that in the Bible. Find in the Bible emotions. You find in the Bible speaking in tongues. You find in the Bible the working of the Holy Ghost, signs and wonders and miracles. You know, you find in the Bible, you know, the um uh supernatural happens find in the B people drunk and you know a whole deal Gloria and you don't have the Gloria. No way. Dio Gloria means the glory of the Lord. So it that's why I um I'm on this thing because from Revelations 10 the prophecy how could you leave out Matthew 25? Yes, &gt;&gt; cuz Matthew 25 hooks up. I don't know if that answers your question. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, Apostle. Thank you. It it actually leads leads into my next question. Um, we we saw when the announcement went out for the services, you've captioned it for us to have a prophetic insight in Matthew 25. Why would you say that? Apostle &gt;&gt; why um if we believe that the seals is prophetic. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because that's a prophecy. And um then how could you leave out Matthew 25? Because Matthew 24 is a six seals. Matthew 25 is a main seal, the coming of the Lord. Behold, the bridegroom will cometh. So if I had to preach on Revelations 10 and never came back to Matthew 25, then I haven't done justice to Revelations 10. &gt;&gt; And then ask yourself the question, is Revelations 10 prophetic? Why don't anybody preach on it only a prophetic class? So that's the reason when I saw that that it actually slides in to the seals and also when it comes to the twins he'll bring Matthew 24:24 on which is in the six seals. It's close. So that's the reason um I that's one of the reasons I hooked it up because it's the coming of the Lord, the seventh seal. Matthew 25 is the seventh seal. And um the wise virgin Edgar is the book of Revelations 10:2 because their names, the wise virgins names is in Revelations 10:2. And that makes it prophetic. That that brings a hallelujah. You know, if we don't if we didn't tie it up over here in the book of Revelations, then we would have had a broken Hallelujah. But so great is this thing here that you can take it and rush it right back to Revelations 10. Her name in the book which is in his right hand. Psalm Revelations 10:1 is the bridegroom. Revelations 10:2 is is his wife. So how can you go wrong? You know, and she's got his spirit. That's why the prophecy says the spirit and the bride. Brother Bible says &gt;&gt; they were one. Now where did they become one is when she filled up with oil. So it is prophetic and that's why for all these years look the message is nearly around for 100 years but nobody ever touched this. You know, they might mention it, but they haven't got insight. This has to come again in the prophecy. Revelations 10:8, prophesy again. What are we doing? We're prophesying again, but out of Matthew, out of the mouth of the guru. How beautiful is that, you know, to to be able to sit here and look at the whole thing played out. But the scary point is what he says, it's it's so close. They got long dresses. They got long hair. They Brother Brandham around the corner. They push and play. They believe the word. They believe in the atonement. They believe in the crucifixion, brother Brandham says. And they have all that and they just show oil and they miss it. So why go to a church that has all that and you know there's no oil there? That's foolish. That's why the Bible says foolish. You know the truth, but you don't accept the truth. and to him that knows to do good and don't do it to him it's sin. So the insin and sin cannot enter heaven. So yeah, that's why we believe what um what our revelation tells us because it swoops in to the message. And how are they going to hear again if there's not somebody that's coming to preach it again? I mean, they were all shaken up when they quoted Revelations 10:8. &gt;&gt; But how is it does it work? How's it going to be preached again? And some guys ruined and run and say, \"Well, that's the bride. You're right.\" But the whole bride don't preach. There's only a five-fold ministry in the bride that preach. The rest is bride, but they don't prophesy. It takes those five guys to prophesy. And I'm sorry, I have never heard any of them prophesy again. And nailing it down again, whether you like it or not. Brother told me revail and and and and and then uh preach on it said way where way reale didn't even believe in it and up to now he can't answer me he rather got cross so um that's why um it I call it prophetic insight. And I'm making it worse. That's the greatest message that has ever been preached. And I'm going to say it when I preach it that Friday. Why I say this is the greatest message that was ever preached. Show me anything greater. Especially when brother Bram comes around and say the Holy Ghost is everything. And I can take you and show you it is everything. So I think that God really wanted us to come back and speak and preach on this. And I say it again, not only the church is going to appreciate it and like it and lift up their voices and their hands about it, I'm going to feel the same. Cuz as I drew up that message, I drew waters out of the wells of salvation once again, you know. So the criteria, I mean, how could he put a criteria in the seventh seal and he says this is the criteria, not even the word, the Holy Ghost. And that's why we're going to read those quotes, you know, that he says he didn't come to give out the Holy Ghost. So then who had to come behind him and give out the Holy Ghost for 60 years? Everybody knows. So we're going to get into that thing that you know when I look at those things then I really get excited it go not not because it's me but why me if it was not in God's thinking that's why this ministry of ours is completely different and brother couldn't put it better to say there's a oddball ministry cuz nobody preaches like we for 60 years. So therefore I I want to encourage the people to um try and get a visitor and pull him along and also encourage the ones that's going to be on streaming which will be on the storehouse. I will give the details of the storehouse and uh for you to get it. I only have one problem Edgar. I really don't know if I'll be able to finish. It's the only problem I have. If not, we'll have to get another Friday. But I would like to have this message, the greatest of them all, to be on tape from the A till the Z. I think I was spared &gt;&gt; to get to this point. I feel so good that Revelations 10 is still moving on the prophecy. It's how long now? And also, Edgar, what I want to say is um why Matthew 25? Because Matthew 25 is the seventh seal and brother Bram says the anointing is on the seventh seal. Now there again I couldn't understand it way back there. I understand it now because I like to nail it back into the Bible. &gt;&gt; And I couldn't understand why he said so. But now I can because in the seventh seal you need the oil the anointing. So where is the anointing? &gt;&gt; On the seventh seal. He said I went west and came back with the Holy Ghost to bring down the Holy Ghost. The oil the seventh seal. The anointing is on the seventh seal. So I hope that that answers your question. &gt;&gt; Yes, surely does mentioning the seven seal apostle. What made you tie it into Revelation? I know you said it's the keystone Revelation. What made you tie Matthew 25 into it? Well, I must be honest. Well, I I I I didn't tie it in. Uh, Brother Brandham tied it in. I only was anointed to pick it up and tie it in like brother Brandham tied it in. And that's why when he said the kingdom of God is likened unto 10 virgins, 10 had oil, 10, five had oil, five didn't have oil, and they went a cry out at midnight, go and meet the bridegroom. And he says that was the coming of the Lord. And I said, \"Wow.\" Then I went and read the sixth seal. In the sixth seal, he brings up Matthew 24 right down and he skips Matthew 25. And then I check in the Bible the six seals one after the other till Revelation 6. It stopped at a six seal. Revelation 6. Revelation 74 144. Then after he skipped that, then he borrowed the seven seals in Revelations 10:8. Is exactly like Matthew 24. He stopped. Then he go to Matthew 25 and he brings out the seventh seal. So I didn't tie it up. I was given eyes and a revelation to see it while nobody else saw it, you know. So, um the six seals he explained and the seventh seal is where the oil is and there's where the anointing is. None of the other seals did you have to have the oil to go in. You were told in the sixth seal with a black horse rider at night oil and the wine it was still there. But that didn't happen there in the third seal. It happened in the seventh seal when they rejected it. Then he says, \"Bang, you rejected the oil. I know you're not.\" Now they preach it a lot of times and it does make sense. What do you mean there I know it not? Is like when a man knows his wife, she receive his seed. But here he knew her not. She had the can and the word but she didn't receive it inside of her. So he says, \"I don't even know you. Can you imagine all the years you prophet prophet prophet and in the end he says I don't know you. He rejected the most important thing and I want to say it. I'm going have to say it when I die and stand in front of God. that you have rejected it in the message. You rejected it. You rejected the working of the Holy Ghost is because you didn't have the Holy Ghost. Now, everybody wants it, but there's no deal, Gloria. It's a sad sad sad case. How many pastors did we have that came to our church and says they would like to have what we have? But the time is up. The time is up. There's a time for everything. There was a time that you could get the Holy Ghost, but there's a time it's cut off. Now, why do you say so? Because Jesus told us, I think Matthew 17, as it was in the days of Noah. Now, what happened in the days of Noah? Genesis 6, he says, \"My spirit, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; shall not always strive with men. My spirit will be taken away.\" And we know with Simpson and all this and Kabot and all that the spirit was taken away and here we are the spirit is taken away and it's hard saw and I want to say tell the brothers and I mean I tell them I don't know if you will be able to get it. They ask me to pray for them. I said, \"I don't know if you're going to get it and be able to take it to your church &gt;&gt; because my concern is you uh you have Revelation 6, Black Rider. There's just a little bit left. That means it dried up until a little bit in the third seal. But when you come to the seventh seal, Matthew 25, there's no oil. The seventh seal, no oil. And that's all that I'm trying to tell them and show them. I said if you can show me where I can get the gloria you know and Jesus makes it so simple for us all. He says by their fruit you will know them. Very simple. If a man says he's evangelist check his fruit. If a man says he's a prophet check his fruit. Is that fruit? He says he is an apostle. Let him show you his fruit of an apostle. It's very simple. The man says the Holy Ghost is gone. And he says, \"You show me where I can find it.\" And you can't find it. Then that guy is right. He's not blobbing. and saying things that is not true. Everybody knows is the truth that the Holy Ghost is gone. A thing that I want to bring in here, people think if they jump and shout and all that that's the Holy Ghost. That's not the Holy Ghost. That's what the Holy Ghost does. It will make you jump and shout and all that. But if you have the Holy Ghost in your church, even somebody outside like how many times it happened just this year, people outside, not of El Tabernacle, Pentecostals and everybody came in and says you can feel the Holy Ghost there. There's an atmosphere. But they preach on the Holy Ghost. No atmosphere, no feeling, no emotions, nothing. So it is only a talk and not a walk. I don't listen to the talk. Just go a token and a token and a to fine but let me see the working of the token. Let me come and hear you preach. Remember that the quote that brother says, you know, uh, let me ask you to come up here and, uh, let the Holy Ghost flow after you preach. You know that quote. And nobody came up. And we have the same thing. But guys speak about the Holy Ghost. Let him come up and preach and show us the dear Gloria. If you can't, you're a deceiver. You're only there to steal tithes. That's all that you care for. And you know you don't have it. That makes it so bad. And that's the reason Jesus emphatically put it down as foolish just because you like the guy's smile. you go with him. You know, I don't care if it's my father. If he don't have the works of his faith, I'm sorry. I hope that is what you asked for. That why we knitted it in to revelations and um brothers is saying they believe everything the lamb that stepped forward and blood and all they believe all that but they just don't have the oil condition. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the condition. Okay. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Apostle. Surely we can agree with what you always quote the scripture where you say you've dug deep and drank strange waters. Once again, that scripture is made manifest. I think um for me it makes it a prophetic message. Surely makes it a prophetic message apostle. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it does. It does. And and the beauty part, Edgar, is not that we feel like that. The fact is it is like that. You cannot have the seventh seal and it's not prophetic. That's why they make such a bigger mistake. They say the seventh seal is silence. Brother Bam says is silence in heaven but activity on the earth. What activity? 10 virgins. Look at that activity. And you'll hear Friday the activity that has gone on by supernatural insight. What has gone on there in Matthew 25? the activity that went on there that it really blows your mind when you just read it. My brother B says we in a prophetic class. That's why we can't say this is prophetic, you know. and seeing it with a prophetic eye, you can look between the lines and realize what has gone on here, which is what we want to bring out. Um, on the 10th, Friday, October, what's written in between the lines to everybody else, it looked like crooked lines. But God likes to write straight on crooked lines. So I hope I answered the question. &gt;&gt; No, thank you Apostle. Um that concludes my questions. I thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. And then um I just want to say again I feel really excited. I mean we have a lot of meetings that we are going to handle until November, but I feel that um this one uh this Friday is going to be one of my pet seminates. And that's the reason I believe it is the greatest message that was ever preached in the end time message. So pray for the meeting and um look into what I tried to tell you about the oil and by prophetic insight you'll see that the oil is the Holy Ghost which is the dynamic dynamics and the dynamics change your body for the rapture and they went in. How did they go in? The oil changed their bodies but the foolish virgins bodies wasn't changed. And that's why brother Bam says what happens to them for the thousand years. He says they are in the grave. But because of the oil, our bodies is changed. If the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, it will change quicken your mortal bodies and then you can go in cuz flesh and blood doesn't go in. They will really change when the foolish virgins went to go look for oil. Can you see how prophetic this thing is? &gt;&gt; So may God bless you.

And what a double portion. Because the apostle said, \"Brother Brandham, it's greater than what you think. I've got an uncle that's a preacher. [music] I've got a cousin that's a preacher. We are family of preacher. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It's greater. It's greater than this quote. It's fun. [music] Can you imagine if one of you [music] can chase a million demons? What about four preachers? [music] What about a family [music] of preachers? House of hell. You in trouble. El tabernacle. El tabernacle. El tabernacle. I'm not here uplifting my family. No. But we can't help for what God has put together. You can't help that you're the bride of Jesus Christ. You can't help as God knew it's going to be you. So no matter what the critic says this morning, I'm embracing my destiny. I'm a child of God. I'm a daughter of God. Oh, hallelujah. [music] I don't think I'm going to finish this morning. He says it's mighty nice. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; If you got a family like that, a church that has a family like that, it's so beautiful. Are you happy this morning? Have you found the family? And I think after last night without a shadow of doubt, he's the greatest preacher, the greatest scientist, the greatest of all time. He's the goat in my books. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You can do better than that. El tabernacle, do you appreciate God's apostle? Do you appreciate God's servant? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. [cheering] There's a saying in our family. We're in the business of saving souls, but not only that, keeping souls safe. &gt;&gt; He knows how to take the vessel. &gt;&gt; He knows how to pour the oil in. He knows every shape and size of every vessel. He knows this one needs a little bit &gt;&gt; and that one needs a lot &gt;&gt; because he's the handler of the oil and he's the God of the generations and he's imparted his knowledge to his family because Jehovah &gt;&gt; is God with his family. He knows &gt;&gt; that your vessel is the soul &gt;&gt; and in the vessel [music] is the nature of God. Zoe, the life of God, &gt;&gt; the oil &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; He says in in Abraham and his [music] seed 610460 &gt;&gt; when you're filled &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; it is the person &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost himself. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a greater gift than the word. You need the person. You need a personal pronoun today. [cheering] on answers maner. We make mistakes [cheering] el tabernacle. If you can just remember one thing today that I have said, you ought to thank God daily for the gift that's in this ministry. You ought to wake up every morning knowing, like the apostle said, there's a God out there. &gt;&gt; We are fortunate people this morning. &gt;&gt; I wonder, can we bow our heads? &gt;&gt; Gracious Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm beside myself this morning. Lord, I pray that you may bless your people. &gt;&gt; Father, it is your people, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we are nothing &gt;&gt; unless somebody &gt;&gt; died for us. &gt;&gt; Somebody loved us, Lord. [cheering] Somebody came our way. [screaming] &gt;&gt; And Lord, it's because of that samarita. Lord, he took us into the inn and he covered our wounds with oil. And we want to say thank you, Lord, for this ministry. Father, may you bless everyone that has come. &gt;&gt; Lord, may you strengthen your servant this day. May you bless him, Father. May you make his heart glad, Father. Lord, we love him. &gt;&gt; We appreciate him, Lord. May you bless your word, &gt;&gt; Lord. I cannot break it. But father, the way you break it, &gt;&gt; the language you speak, &gt;&gt; Lord, your sheep understands the language. Lord, may you bless our servers this morning. If there be a visitor in the camp, &gt;&gt; Lord, may their hearts burn within them &gt;&gt; to say, \"Father, I'm not going to harden my heart, &gt;&gt; but I'm giving you my heart this morning. &gt;&gt; I've given you my heart &gt;&gt; and we know it's in a good place this morning, Lord. Come now &gt;&gt; and bless us, Father. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But the hotter it gets, &gt;&gt; the better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] I wonder at this moment in time just turn to your brother, your sister, say, \"It's good to be here. I love you. I appreciate you.\" To the visitor friend, just go shake someone's hand that you don't know. Welcome to the service this morning. Oh, it's so beautiful. Don't be cross this morning. Just just turn to that person, you know, and just say, \"I love you. I appreciate you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just I just want to rub it in a little, you know. I just want to rub it in a little. [music] want to do something. [music] You you have my two grandsons preaching with me, but I would like to just rub it in. I got my grandson on their piano. my grandson on the piano [music] [applause] and I have a double portion. I have my grandson on the bass guitar. Get up there. Give us a strum there. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Jealous Tom. Jealous Tom [cheering] [music] and the whole family in heaven. &gt;&gt; Did you ever see a thing like this? &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; But our tabernacle, we have it here. Thank you. Let's give God's apostle a hand. Let's give Brother Eda a hand. Let's give the troll Augustine a hand. [music] Let's give the Augustine family a hand. Uncle Ariel, my cousins, let's give the family a hand this morning. [music] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I just want to also rub it in. Grandpa Topella, do you have that picture? It's the angel. Let's just give her a hand [applause] now, man. Sir, &gt;&gt; it's a family weekend for ons. &gt;&gt; So, I'm entitled to bring out the files. &gt;&gt; Amen. So they won't tell you it, but I actually converted all these cousins. [cheering] &gt;&gt; They were in my meetings. Sister Esther, [music] there's Uriah in one of my church services there. So I wasn't ordained a preacher. No, man. I was born I was born into royalty. I didn't have a choice but I was born into it. [cheering and applause] And there's no pleasure better, no golf game, no singing a song can [music] compared to doing something for God's people. It's better than being the president of a country is to have a preacher. Amen, sir. Amen, sir. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you have your Bibles this morning, turn to two portions of scripture. So, let's leave Matthew. &gt;&gt; Let's leave Luke. But let's go to John because John speaks plainly. John doesn't beat around the bush. John will say who the son of God is. [cheering and applause] John 5 verse 39 and 40. John 5:39 and 40. &gt;&gt; Search the scriptures. &gt;&gt; I invite you this morning. &gt;&gt; Visit a friend eel tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Search, search this Bible. For in them ye think &gt;&gt; in those scriptures &gt;&gt; you think that you have eternal life. &gt;&gt; And little do you know &gt;&gt; they are they &gt;&gt; which only testify [cheering] &gt;&gt; of me. &gt;&gt; Jesus. You can go and search the scriptures, but it's only a testimony of the son Beth. &gt;&gt; But the problem we make is we think that's where the eternal life is. &gt;&gt; Amen, sir. Amen. Sir, &gt;&gt; amen. [cheering] and he will not come unto me. &gt;&gt; It's so deep this thing. &gt;&gt; It's like the apostle said it's the saddest line. &gt;&gt; Because we find that they majored on the testimony of the word &gt;&gt; and they thought they've got life. And here Jesus your God says, \"Why don't you search the scriptures?\" &gt;&gt; He invites you this morning. [cheering] &gt;&gt; But he will not come unto me a foolish virgin. Even in that scripture, &gt;&gt; the scripture doesn't do anything &gt;&gt; because you can take this book, you can buy it at any bookshop, you can this is very available &gt;&gt; but this can't save me. I need [cheering] &gt;&gt; [music] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Did you catch it? &gt;&gt; Why do I need that? Because I need eternal life. &gt;&gt; I never came to church to waste my time from Joberg on blue day. I don't I don't Why must I be here? I came for eternal life. &gt;&gt; I came for eternal [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; And he's sad because he says he will not come &gt;&gt; that you might have life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But El tabernacle I'm like the hymnwriter this morning. &gt;&gt; Say, \"Here's my vessel. &gt;&gt; Here's my cup. &gt;&gt; I want you to fill it up. Not with the letter, not with the script, but with the manifestation of that word, which is the eternal life of God, which is Zoe.\" Because the letter &gt;&gt; but the spirit. &gt;&gt; So if the spirit gives life, &gt;&gt; why do they major on the letter? &gt;&gt; John 6 verse 60 &gt;&gt; to 69. Many therefore of his disciples &gt;&gt; when they heard this said, &gt;&gt; \"This is a hard saying. &gt;&gt; Who can hear it?\" &gt;&gt; When it comes to his blood, &gt;&gt; when it comes to drinking, &gt;&gt; when it comes to the flesh, &gt;&gt; it's a hard thing. [cheering] When it comes to communion, &gt;&gt; when Jesus knew in himself that the disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, &gt;&gt; \"Do this offend you &gt;&gt; in El Tabernacle, is it offending you?\" &gt;&gt; Because this is where the division comes. Because you need to have so much faith in your leader. Because if you don't believe in the leader, he will take you to your damnation. He will take you to a destination you do not want to be. &gt;&gt; So you've got to have faith in your leader. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; David was so powerful that the congregation that the whole of Israel chanted his name because they had faith that this David slew a Goliath. That means there's a God with this little man. There's a God in this little body. There's a God in this little man. [cheering] And this morning we have another representation. There's a God in a man [cheering] that has slayed your Goliath in your life. [cheering] And that is why this is a glorious church without spot or wrinkle because we know who our leader is. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You've got to have faith in God's servant. How do you do the will of God or the works of God? Believe. [cheering] [screaming] &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do this morning. You just got to believe in the scent one which is an apostolic gift. [cheering] [applause] Many want to do something for God. Many want to walk for God. &gt;&gt; But all you've got to do is believe. &gt;&gt; That's the requirement. &gt;&gt; Then you pass from death unto life because it's not your problem. We in the business of saving souls. He's the handler of the oil. He knows your need. Expel your thoughts to your pastor. Your pastor will see you through. It's the dove leading the eagle. It's the ammoya. Don't burden yourself this morning. It's too much for you. Give it over and believe it. If it's of God, it will come to pass. If it's of God, it will manifest itself. If it's of God, it's not your business to question. Just believe, child of God, [music] what? And if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before. Here Jesus asks them a question. Maybe if you see me &gt;&gt; ascend. Maybe that will boost your faith. Because as human beings that's what we want. We want an angel now &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven. We want a quick miracle. &gt;&gt; We need something to convince us that this is it. That's human nature. &gt;&gt; That's the life you in. But you need an eternal life where you pull your strength and you say, \"I I don't understand it, but I believe it this morning. I don't need you to ascend. I don't need you to go up. [screaming] You're on the earth now. You're on the earth now. Don't go up. Take me with you. Say hallelujah somebody. Say hallelujah. Somebody. We are not like the disciples this morning. We don't need a quick thing. We believe it. We believe it this morning. Oh, hallelujah. It is the spirit. The spirit that quickenth, &gt;&gt; it is the spirit. &gt;&gt; That quickenth because your body is weak. Your body has mistakes. But the spirit within you, it revives you week in and weak out. It's your power bank. [cheering] I'm going to leave the others. Let me just get to my point. Verse 67. Then Jesus said unto the 12, \"Ye will he also go. El tabernacle, &gt;&gt; will you also go?\" [cheering] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus this morning asking the church, \"Will you also go?\" Then Simon Peter. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like Peter. Oh, he spoke his mind. He wasn't like the 12 that was confused. Oh, who's living beside me? Peter jumped up. Peter jumped up. Peter jumped up. Oh, and he looked the Messiah, &gt;&gt; the son of the living loving God in the eye [cheering] and he says, \"Lord, [screaming] Lord, Lord, to whom shall we go?\" El tabernacle. El tabernacle. Where can we go from this? It took an apostolic answer. It took the guy with the keys to the Holy Ghost to answer &gt;&gt; and say, \"Where are we going to go?\" &gt;&gt; And Peter doesn't stop there. &gt;&gt; El tabernacle, I want you to read it. &gt;&gt; Thou, &gt;&gt; just read it one more time. Just one more time. &gt;&gt; You need a preacher. You need a leader &gt;&gt; that's got the word for your day. &gt;&gt; You need someone that's got eternal life. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add a blessing &gt;&gt; to the reading of this word. [cheering] &gt;&gt; May you just hug your brother and your sister before you take your seat. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry for keeping you so long, Grandpa. I'm sorry for letting you stand so long, but it needs to sink in this morning. It needs to go into your theophony this morning. You need to realize who you are. &gt;&gt; You need to realize that you're just not by the way. &gt;&gt; You need to realize that any church out there can't give you eternal life. Mike like for Peter man &gt;&gt; the others were so confused &gt;&gt; and he throws the ball back to Jesus. &gt;&gt; It was the greatest tennis match &gt;&gt; because Jesus asked the question first. &gt;&gt; Are you going to go? [cheering] And Peter said, \"Where are we going to go, &gt;&gt; Lord? Where can we go?\" &gt;&gt; He says, \"You've got the words of eternal life.\" &gt;&gt; And imagine how Jesus felt. He knew that that answer came directly from the father above. Because only the father can put that desire in your heart to know where you come from, to know where you going to, to know who's your leader, to know who's your representative. [cheering] &gt;&gt; And visitor friend, we invite you this morning. &gt;&gt; Where are you going to go? Which church are you going to go to this morning that can give you the everlasting gospel? That can give you eternal life abundantly, that can preach the gospel without any shortity. You need a church. You need a representation from the throne of God. You need a guide that can take you by the hand and show you the ABCs and show you what is the basics of the Ephesians church age. They can show you there will be babies born in the millennium. They can show you the genetics of God. They can show you how the atom was broken. They can show you how life formed. They can show you creation started. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; like a Pentecostal experience without beginning and without the end. That is what life is this morning. Life is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Life is the Amoya. Life is Zoe. The goal. [cheering] Oh, I'm excited this morning. I'm excited this morning. I want to be like Peter. I want to say, \"Where can I go, Lord? Where can I go? You've got the words of eternal life. [cheering] For a title this morning, [cheering] we started the weekend with a question. &gt;&gt; Where is the God of Elijah? [cheering] Let's end it with a question. Lord, to whom shall we go? &gt;&gt; Thou has the words of eternal life. &gt;&gt; I want to take that thought this morning. And I want to put it in your lap this morning. El tabernacle visit a friend. &gt;&gt; Where can we go &gt;&gt; in the hour that we love him? in the time that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 30:1 19 says, \"I call heaven and earth to record this day against you.\" &gt;&gt; That I have set before you life. &gt;&gt; I have set before you. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; so the choice is yours this morning. Do you want eternal life &gt;&gt; or do you want a wordbased doctrine that's full of the scriptures that's so hard to digest? But when you have a ministry, hallelujah, that's got the oil to mix the meal and digest the system and move down. And when it reaches your system, it knows how to go because the body is so beautifully made. There's a certain amount of oil that your spiritual body needs and when it gets that [cheering] you feel leer in the service brothers they can [cheering] say word [cheering] [cheering] a blessing and a curse. Therefore, choose life &gt;&gt; that both thou. &gt;&gt; Can you read it for me? that both thou. &gt;&gt; So if this family, &gt;&gt; if this preaches, &gt;&gt; if the old man in the quote &gt;&gt; didn't choose life, &gt;&gt; read that part again at the bottom there, that thy &gt;&gt; we are alive this morning. We came to preach this morning because we have a handler of the oil that chose eternal life for his family that says, \"Rosco family, we're going to choose the blessing. We're going to choose the blessing. We're going to be like Jacob this morning. We're going to steal the Holy Ghost from every church, from every denomination, from every organization. And we took the blessing. We took the birthright.\" The apostle ran with the stump, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he says, \"This is for my family. [cheering] &gt;&gt; This is for my church. Amen.\" [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Years back they told the apostle, \"You chose the best part. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; You took the best part &gt;&gt; of the whole lamb of the whole [cheering] because everything like Pastor Jude said is the Holy Ghost. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; In march to the blood, the apostle says, \"Isn't sin like death? Sin sold the prince of life &gt;&gt; for a mere 30 pieces of silver. It will always make eternal life cheap. &gt;&gt; Sin in your life will always make eternal life cheap. &gt;&gt; If you are a sinner, don't treat eternal life with contempt. If you're not, then why are you still going on in sin? &gt;&gt; A sinner treats eternal life cheap and mortal life gets treated with glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sir, &gt;&gt; can I get a amen? [cheering] &gt;&gt; It's hard, but it's the truth. &gt;&gt; And not only the sinner, but also in our in our in our church. We treat our car as if it's everything. &gt;&gt; We treat our health as if it's everything. But we fail to realize that we are not here on our own merit. We are called our people. We are holy priesthood. We are chosen nation.\n"}, {"id": "2024-08-30 - Is It Kamala Harris, Then The Earthquake  Apostle Edgar H.

William Branham. Don't miss this must-watch video for every End-Time Message believer seeking deeper understanding and clarity. \n\nTune in to uncover insights that could shape your perspective on the times we're living in!\nTRANSCRIPT\n========================================\nuh good evening El tle it's uh as again we thought about making uh this video clip again uh because things as I told you the last time things are happening so fast that um we can't keep up um because you know you know our ministry is not a ordinary Ministry is is um Apostolic which brother Braham says it's evangelism and uh prophetic uh combin U make the apostolic uh Ministry so it's not an ordinary minist Ministry by taking a word and and expounding on a word and you know but it's uh based more on what brother brandham has prophesied on the prophetic side and um getting the sense of it now we we have anointed that quote for many years in birth pains that brother Bram says men will come after me and make more SS because brother brandham didn't have enough time on many topics that he he actually um uh preached on and prophesied so um uh I think that's the reason he he put that quote out so I I just uh want to remind you about what I heard believe Paul told us when brother B preached on the rapture how that woman went on brother brandham didn't have enough time to finish it because she was running at the back then and waving and telling brother Brandon we must stop and the prophet uh really couldn't put uh his teeth into the thing so uh he um just said enough for the five minut to pick it up and uh uh and Mak sense to it and and and a lot of you know statue of a perfect man all those quotes uh messages so we uh are yeah and U with the prophecy and the the seven visions of brother brandham to actually uh make more sense to it and uh we uh have dissected it and when we saw these things happening the Prophecies of brother brandham came to our attention and that's the reason we busy that's why we say that U we uh we're just different our ministry is different our preaching is different Paul says You Preach according to your faith you know so this is according to our faith on the prophetic level not that we are prophets but brother brandham you know brother sister we in a prophetic class so prophetic class needs a prophet uh to preach to them so brother Brandon preached to us and us in the prophetic class could understand him and further break it down so uh I thought let me just tell you that and uh I uh have entitled the thing is it Camila's is Camila Harris uh uh then the earthquake is it she first and then the earthquake so I got reason why I said so I I'll show you Clips just now that really shocked me so I thought uh let me get back to you because I won't be here um next week on Friday uh we'll be in Angola so I thought uh we'll make this video club for Friday so that you can be on par on what's happening in the world so listen I'm only venturing in I'm only pondering like brother Val used to like this word pondering let's Ponder I'm only pondering I'm only saying could it be or predicting not prophesying in that this thing might be in this sequence so I have the sequence that I feel it might be that way and you know we we all have our own ideas and we have uh our own Inspirations how it'll happen but God is the one that actually put it really in in sequence so uh I have the elections which is going on now and then uh after that the 70 weeks of Daniel and the 70th Jubilee uh running out um in September and uh you know that uh the um rabis is now really on this thing about September where the jubilees is running out and um and point number three is uh could it do money will fail in Statue of a perfect man after that and could after that be the earthquake and could after the earthquake be right in the seventh Vision when Elijah and Moses will be coming to 144,000 and uh could it be in that sequence which is actually the end of the world we know that the ab bomb which is the end of the world will that five things happen like there and the pope sits in Jerusalem and break the treaty now I gave you the quote nothing wrong with probing brother Bram tells you that and SS is a time there's nothing wrong in probing when you probe you just when going to see can it be so that's why he say says is this the time he was probing and uh although it was thus say the Lord and um so we we we only proing so um we have listened to Trump on the on the club of trump uh Trump saying Camila Harris is a beautiful human uh uh woman so let's listen to him Time Magazine think of this Time Magazine doesn't have a picture of her they have this unbelievable artist drawing her and I said is that Sophia Laura and I couldn't who might that be is that Elizabeth Taylor they say she was a beautiful woman who is it so beautiful drawing it's a drawing they took a lot of pictures it didn't work out so they hired a sketch artist I said I'm sure oh they must be celebrating the great Life and Times of the magnificently beautiful Sophia Lauren and you're not allowed to say this anymore you know David don't ever get caught in this trap David please don't ever call a woman beautiful because that'll be the end of your political career please I want to make your life much easier David by the way he's also got a great wife I have to say he's got a great wife but you know I mean I read a a so-called Republican who Ronald Reagan didn't like by the way and she didn't like him but she got credit for being this Reagan speech writer highly overrated I don't know anything about her I don't know her treats me badly but that's okay she called it wrong she's called it wrong now for about eight years but she said one thing that got me she said kamla has one big Advantage she's a very beautiful woman she's a [Music] so I decid to go back and reread the Clause I'm not saying he's but I say that I am much better looking than her I think I'm much better much better I'm a better looking person then CA well there you have it um the um the beauty of Kamala is now now we have the Roman Catholic Church beautiful and now they are saying that Chamilia is but beautiful so imagine being an uh opponent or R rival saying this and we have the prophet saying she look like uh uh she she's a beautiful woman she look like uh he says she you look like Sophia Lauren now if you young people ever saw Sophia Lauren she is also blushing blacking you know she was one of the the Queens in the 60s I think uh but brother brandham also speak about a beautiful woman I wonder if we got a quote then when these women help elect the wrong person then seen a great woman rise up in the United States well-dressed and beautiful but cruel and heart she will either guide or lead this nation to a ruination I got in princes perhaps Catholic Church there you have the quote uh how could brother Brandon 91 years ago say a thing like this and here Trump comes and say the same thing so um it shows you that um it is right in line um with uh What uh the prophet um saw uh 91 years ago 19 uh 33 and uh we could say that that portion of um of the prophecy is fulfilled Trum fulfilled it the other day then the write up on the cover of Time Magazine is um it's a a beautiful picture of her there she is and um we will uh play the quote she'll be a pretty human now both is pretty human as we already played the quote so um and the right up in Time Magazine will take a f things out there the reintroduction of CA Harris excerpts from the article published by Time Magazine inside of Philadelphia Arena on August 6th vice president camela Harris was greeted with a kind of reception a Democratic presidential candidate hasn't G en in years fans packed into overflow spaces waving homemade signs made of glitter and glue as drum lines roared when Harris introduced her new running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walls the cheering lasted more than a minute if you'd predicted this scene a month ago to anyone following the race they would never have believed you but Harris has pulled off the swiftest vibe shift in modern political history a contest that revolved around the cognitive decline of a geriatric president has been transformed Joe Biden is out Harris is in and a second Donald Trump presidency no longer seems inevitable Democrats resigned to a grim Death March toward certain defeat as one National organizer put it felt their Gloom replaced by a jolt of Hope Harris smashed fundraising records raking in 310 milli in July she packed stadiums and dominated Tik Tock offering a fresh message focused on the future over the past volunteers signed up in droves Trump's widening leads across the Battleground States evaporated over the span of a few weeks in Late July and early August Harris became a political phenomenon our campaign is not just a fight against Donald Trump she told the cheering crowd in Philadelphia our campaign is a fight for the future judging from the past few weeks Harris's own party underestimated her maybe the crowded 2020 primary just wasn't the right race for Harris to Showcase her talents maybe the vice presidency wasn't the right role suddenly she seems matched to the moment a former prosecutor running against a convicted felon a defender of abortion rights running against the man who helped overturn Row versus Wade a Next Generation Democrat running against a 78-year-old Republican perhaps above all she has given Americans the one thing they overwhelmingly told polsters they wanted a credible alternative to the two unpopular old men who have held the job for the past eight long years Harris may still be the dog Trump has arguably the clearer path to 270 electoral votes and an edge on the issues that voters say are most important to them she inherited a campaign infrastructure and policy record from her predecessor but the energy is all hers picking walls as a running mate over more conventional choices signals a belief that this race is as much about feelings as it is about fundamentals Harris's brand shift the happy warrior attitude the viral memes the iroll at Republican weirdos has already done what no Trump opponent has ever been able to do snatch the spotlight away from him she may seem like an overnight sensation but Harris's moment was years in the making quietly her small team of top AIDS had been laying the groundwork for a future presidential run after the Supreme Court's dobs decision the vice president added Reproductive Rights to her portfolio abortion was never a comfortable issue for Biden a devout Catholic but it was a natural fit for his number two Harris believed that with Rog gone Republicans would turn their sights to restricting both birth control and IVF in the months after dobs she traveled the us talking about abortion rights as a matter of reproductive Freedom as far back as the 2022 midterms Aid say she argued for making this the core of the party's National message even as the White House focused on jobs and the economy with Biden no longer a top the ticket the morban Democratic Grassroots came to life Harris was capable of delivering a message that never felt quite right under Clinton or Biden that theirs was the party of the future and Trump was of the past her campaign raised $200 million in the first week in what it said was the best 24 hours of any candidate in presidential campaign history more than 38,000 people registered on vote.org in the 48 hours after she became the presumptive nominee eclipsing the voter registration surge encouraged by Taylor Swift Last year within a week Harris erased Trump's polling dominance in key States turning a burgeoning landslide into a dead heat elections come down to Vibes and CA has got the Vibes right now says David hog co-founder of the genz political organization leaders we deserve after spending his entire political career organizing against Trump and his allies hog explains it felt good to finally have someone to vote for people are feeling the type of energy they felt during the Obama campaign says Michigan state senator Darren caleri who spends his weekends door knocking in his competitive District South of Detroit it feels different than with Hillary different than with Biden celebrities like Charlie XCX and Megan the stallion came out in support of Paris speaking in a packed airplane hanger in Detroit UAW president sha Fain called her a badass woman the campaign's new Harris walls camo hats sold out within half an hour Grassroots groups are seeing an explosion in fundraising and volunteer signups my niece who called Biden genocide Joe called me to say auntie I want to do something recall S leosha brown co-founder of black voters matter the shift is perhaps most visible in the digital sphere while millions of Hardcore Democrats would crawl over broken glass to keep Trump from reelection less reliable voters in gen Z are especially attuned to online trends for months President Biden's online supporters have been on the defensive about his support for Israel's war against Hamas comments about Gaza flooded Pro Biden content posted to social platforms making it difficult to create what digital strategists call a permission structure to support him to many it evoked the online mobs who would mock Clinton's supporters in 2016 preventing her from building traction on social media in 2016 if you wanted to be an online supporter of Hillary Clinton you did it in a private Facebook group says Litman in 2024 you blasted on Tik Tok and you're part of the kive and you make your username the coconut tree her early months as VP were checkered too big interviews went poorly Harris seemed ill-prepared and unsteady on her feet Biden reportedly vented to a friend that she was a work in progress he saddled her with a portfolio of difficult thankless work like addressing the root causes of the flow of undocumented immigrants from Central America's Northern triangle by 2023 Harris had the lowest approval ratings for a vice president in history it's always hard for the vice president because the president is the one setting the policy taking the responsibility says represent ative Adam Schiff a California Democrat and close Ally of Harris and historically vice presidents have often taken on the work that the president doesn't want to do another Democrat puts it more bluntly they set her up to fail from day one one challenge for Harris has been the people around her over the years a rotating cast of senior staff has clouded her message and raised questions about her abilities as a manager she needs a few political consiliari in her life she doesn't have a North star guiding her says one Democratic strategist she has made novice political moves that the political Elite and the pundits have glommed on to that have pushed the narrative that she's not ready for prime time that narrative has been out of date for some time according to allies who have worked with her and watched her closely Harris has mastered the art of arm twisting required to pass major legislation and become a global Diplomat championing Democratic goals she has gone Booker says from being a Padawan to a Jedi master yet if Harris was widely underestimated it's also true that her circumstances have radically changed success in politics is situational Harris no longer has to compete with more than 20 other democrats for attention on the campaign Trail or contort herself to appease liberal pities to win over the party's base she no longer has to be a loyal Deputy to the president who calls all the shots now the moment is finally hers Republicans admit Harris will be harder to beat than a diminished Biden but they believe the candidate Riding High the past few weeks will soon under sustained attack come down to earth if she runs the same kind of campaign she ran in 2019 and 20120 her campaign will collapse and Donald Trump will Waltz into the White House Republican pollster Whit a says on the other hand if she has learned as much as her allies and friends say she has in the last four years she will give Trump a real run for his money Harris is more popular with younger black and Latino voters than Biden was when he dropped out of the race according to polling which puts her in a stronger position to win the Sun Belt states at the same time she may be losing ground with older white voters which makes her more vulnerable in the trio of blue wall States Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that form that core of the Democrats Electoral College strategy to shore up those States Harris is is leaning on her major labor endorsements and making multiple visits to the Upper Midwest Harris inherited Biden's campaign infrastructure including more than 260 outposts across the Battleground States in Nevada the Harris campaign has 13 field officers to Trump's one in Pennsylvania it has 36 coordinated officers to Trump's 3 according to a campaign memo in the first 12 days of her camp campaign Harris supporters placed 2.3 million phone calls and made 172,000 house visits while Battleground organizers are knocking on swing voters doors the campaign's digital strategy is designed partly around reaching hard-to-reach voters and convincing them to choose between our candidate and the couch says Deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty the Avalanche of viral memes about Harris the enthusiastic Tik Tok videos and the massive Zoom calls of devoted supporters black women for Harris white dudes for Harris Latino men for Harris have made this task easier that's the kind of enthusiasm that money can't buy Flaherty says but Harris's moment also comes after eight years of transformation and Triumph for American women after Clinton's stinging defeat in 2016 women flooded the streets in the largest protest March in US history then formed a massive Grassroots electoral movement that helped Democrats overperform in most elections since the attack lines from the Republicans are going to be on Race and gender and those are going to work to her Advantage says Ashley etn a former communications director for the vice president all that was baggage is is now an asset amen I hope that you have uh listened carefully to that clip and it's all human human human human and um and human cause the fall we know that just if you take Genesis then you'll see the Decay that's brought by a woman woman fell with a silen in Genesis 3:6 lch had two wives Genesis 2 vers 23 which is polygamy it broke down further Genesis 62 they took themselves wives fre sex out of wedlock fornication Genesis 63 Abram two wives Genesis 1934 lot SL with his own daughters which is incest Genesis 345 sex of its children D not fell Genesis 195 hos sexuality that is just in Genesis how the moral Decay came just there not even any place else in the Bible just in Genesis and here we have a scenario where it's all woman as I said with the last clip that we put on so we see that this was in Time Magazine time says is this the time brother Bram says so we can say is this the time and season when humans going to cause the fall of the world then the next thing that happens which is ironic the Moon Over Australia they called a blue moon if we can get the right up and the club bar tonight you have the chance to see a rare super Blue Moon just step outside or just watch right here this is a live look right now at the moon shining in the night sky cvsa Jasmine Ramirez joins us in studio right now to tell us why this moon is considered to be so rare yeah that's right Marcel and this live look is pretty great tonight's moon it's supposed to be really bright and really big now having a super Blue Moon just anything like this really it only happens about every 10 years a super blue moon is a Celestial phenomenon tonight it was captured around the globe here you can see it glowing in Turkey Rising into the night sky in Greece shining in Portugal and peeking through the clouds in Australia the big excitement is just for the public to look up see a very bright beautiful full moon tonight I talked with Douglas Leonard a professor of astronomy at San Diego State he says a super moon happens when the moon is at its closest point to the Earth this makes it appear super big and super bright next I asked him what a blue moon is if you happen to have four full moons in one season like summer Okay the third of those full four full moons is called a blue moon so just how how rare is it to have a super blue moon to have a blue moon and which occurs about every every two or 3 years and a super moon which occurs about 25% of the time to have those two things occur together on one full moon happens about every decade and so that's what makes it a bit interesting that's why he recommends going outside and catching a glimpse of it this is such a cool event because it's something that everyone can enjoy that everyone can see easily and appreciate Maxwell palao is an astronomer here in San Diego taking photos of the moon and stars is one of his favorite things to do he has advice if you want to capture tonight's moon but if you really want to capture the best way to do it is to either have a pair of binoculars or a telescope and then put your iPhone or your Android device and put right up against the eyepiece and then take a picture of the Moon it'll look incredible and tonight's clear skies in San Diego will also help give a clear view of the moon now it's best to go outside and see it now I'm told the next Super Blue Moon it likely won't happen until 2037 Marcela that's so interesting so you know you hear the phrases once in a blue moon so that's great that you explained why it's rare to have a super moon and also Blue Moon and then people hear the word blue and they're looking at the photo thinking like does it have a little bit of a blue hue is the moon really blue or why does this you know why is it called a blue moon right no I asked that exact same question I did learn the term Blue Moon is really used to describe the third full moon in a season with four of them now in this case we're having four full moons this summer amen no no why we saw on this is because uh the day that Biden resigned I showed you the very night in New York City around the statue of Liberty she was covered or she's been in or behind her was a red moon why did we have this all at one time and we know what the moon represents when brother BR say Pope went to Israel and he showed you how the moon changed until it blackened out and then too in brandham Tabernacle the angel came down and through the seven Church ages as seven moons and the last one was totally dark and brother Bron put a little light in there that's why it represents the church ages resent represents a woman so why is is it's so explicit this time with the moon does he tell us because as above so below he put those things in the heavens as signs and seasons and Genesis says is this a sign that that woman is going to come in and you could have looked for the this week most of the week we had full full moons so it's so unusual the ordinary Moon full and then you had a blue moon you had a red moon everything is Moon which is a human so could them I'm asking could them be a sign that that woman is here if not you heard they can't even tell you the why of the matter they don't even go back to the the the day uh Biden resigned and there was a red moon so there is Def defitely a significance uh I'm sure if brother Brandon was around he wouldn't have left this thing because it's it's a strange phenomena what we are seeing happening just with the moons so as I said as above so below and then the thing that hit me last week in Monday is the earthquake she nearly went why is all these things right in the circle of Camila and it's been shaking ever since so I thought that we will have the clips um on that Quake watch it oh my [Applause] oh my God oh my oh my oh my God isn't that scary we that know what happened when brother Bram preached on choosing a bride how brother brandham puts this in choosing of a bride just take another listen to it I know you heard this but to see a thing happens and then go back to what brother brandham says in the prophecy it's really shaking I do not know I thank God for this guy that came to me he says you know brother Rosco um the things that you have put out there is really scaring it it it buckles my knees I says not only you my brother I am also shaken to see such a lot of things happen at the same time that speaking about meeting the Messiah you know because the seven Visions is before meeting the Messiah you know the earthquake is I'm going to tell you just now what it is it's also to do with the Messiah listen to how it is put in sincerity from the prophet thou City who claims to be the city of the Angels who's exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of Fashions and things the even the foreign countries come here to pick up our filth and send it away with your fine churches and Steeples and so forth the way you do remember one day you will be laying in the bottom botom of the sea you're a great honeycom under you right now the wrath of God is belching right beneath you how much longer you'll hold this sandb hanging out over that on that ocean out under a mile deep will slide in there Plum back to the salt and sea it'll be worse than the last day of pompe repent Los Angeles repent the rest of you and turn to God the hour of his Wrath upon the Earth flee while there's time to flee and come into Christ listen to that voice of urgency of desperation and here Monday it was nearly so nearly the only thing is the sequence that 144,000 has to be sealed and this woman must first come in otherwise Los Angeles would have been gone last week look how it look how it actually went just in the street how those cars were shifting look at the buildings collapsing it was like the africanis umerus nearly nearly gone 4 for earthquake so that's what the Bible says as I'm going to read it it's spoken in The Sixth Seal this earthquake Revelation 6:12 a great earthquake then spoken of this of it in the seventh trumpet Revelations 11:13 seven trumpet the Seven Seals same thing verse 192 it speaks about it then it speaks about it in the seventh vial the earthquake the biggest earthquake ever Revelation 16:18 then the great quake in Matthew 282 when the graves was open is this what's going to happen when Los Angeles open will Matthew 28 and Matthew 27 51 and 52 when the dead in Christ shall rise with this earthquake will this be like that that's why when I see a thing like this and I see it in the scripture and I see brother brandham say it I have no doubt I don't care what the critic says it's going to come to pass and as I say it nearly happened last week August month so let's take another clip you might be wondering have we been having more of them than normal well we did get the answer for you tonight and it is yes we are having the most seismically active year in almost four decades and experts say the shaking is likely to continue another earthquake hit Southern California this time near Lake Elenor it happened this morning around 9:30 the magnitude 3.9 earthquake rocked homes but so far no damage has been reported this is the third sizable earthquake in Southern California in just a couple of days Southern California has experienced multiple earthquakes this week as I'm sure all of you know and this is a good reminder now is the time to prepare for an even larger one through the Northridge Earthquake so you know the first thing I said is I think the big one's coming guys Judith gold the owner of Luca natural goods and Highland Park remembers the progression of smaller Quakes leading up to a very destructive one I know that this is the signs that a bigger earthquake is probably going to come I mean I hope I'm wrong it passes us but it usually that's how it was um before the nor northri earthquake some breaking news of 4.4 earthquake hitting the Las Vegas Valley tonight according to USGS Quake hit about 806 about 4 miles Northwest of Indian Springs Nevada the Quake was 5.8 Mi deep Indian Springs is home to Cree Air Force Base is 45 Mi Northwest of the Las Vegas Strip there were no immediate reports of any injuries or damage as you'd expect of a quake of this size but it was felt in a wide area of Nevada the recent earthquake that jolted the Southland is sparking concern and highlighting a much smaller but potentially more threatening fault line the fault running from the Pasadena area to Puente Hills has been very very active in recent months all the way over in Santa Monica a cam facing the pier shows the power of the large shocks well so far there's been a few after shocks but nothing significant two months ago there was actually a smaller quick That Shook that exact same area here in La a lot more recently and did feel a few of those but not nothing that strong as what we just felt in South PAAD from 2013 to 2023 Dr Jones says there was an average of five magnitude four or stronger shakers but 2024 has been a lot more volatile already this year there have been 13 magnitude 4 or stronger Quakes this year is now an active year again 2024 has had more earthquakes than any year we've seen since 1988 here's seismologist Dr Lucy Jones we had a six on this on this system in 1987 and it was like 350 million doll in damage and three direct deaths so when we've modeled what would it be like to have a 7 and a half on the penty Hills thrust we get 10 times as much damage as we see for a 7.9 on the San Andreas because we have so many more buildings and people on top of an earthquake if it's pente Hills Monday's 4.4 magnitude earthquake happened in the same area as a 3.4 magnitude earthquake June 2nd and both produced aftershocks nearby so they're all in about the same location uh within somewhere within the Plenty Hills thrust system so what should the everyday californi take from that not much we have earthquakes this is a great reminder that all of Southern California is earthqu country every one of us in the Los Angeles metropolitan area is within 5 miles of an active fault and which one of those are going to go within our lifetime is random scientists at Yellowstone National Park telling us this was a random event happening without warning some wild new vide showing an explosion at Yellowstone National Park a geyser going off sending tourists running for cover run run run Park officials closed the biscuit Basin area while they surveyed the damage the area is home to several geysers in pools including the sapphire pool which had a similar eruption in 1991 what happened is that an unusual event where a lot of pressure built up and with that so much pressure it again forced its way out it erupted officials say there did not appear to be any signs of an imminent volcanic eruption well that's good news geologists are investigating what exactly happened the scientist in charge with the Yellowstone volcano Observatory says this is not connected to volcanic activity which is often associated with the part well David scientists at Yellowstone tell us that this was a random event without warning still they are investigating exactly what happened and what it might mean for the future of this area David the last time an explosion similar to this happened at Yellowstone's biscuit Basin was back in 2009 yeah that was really something to see MOA thank you amen isn't it scary doesn't that shake a religious conceptions and arguments to put it one side and concentrate on Modern events that prophecy is making clear that we that is in this message we that's walking in this message for over 56 years heard and quoted these things time and time and time again but here it's upon us even the scientist doesn't know when but a scary point is 2024 why 2024 Kam's here the earthquakes has has actually tripled up so where are we at so El Tabernacle as your pastor I cannot help but put it in front in front of you I cannot bring something positive but a negative thing for what I see because I'm am reminded of what brother brandham says this earth needs a funeral service to be preached to and if there ever was a time that this earth needs a funeral service is now and wake up people to the fact that hey is no more F in the future it's on our doorstep it's right here we cannot try and put this thing under the carpet anymore it is staring us right in the face so so I thought that that would be a good thing then I ask you with a combin see that you finished pay your credits why because in Genesis 47:15 money failed in the land of Egypt we know that that is part and parcel of Camila coming in she's going to let America get busted up we know that brother Brenham said that in Statue of a perfect man and it's funny whenever you have a perfect man money goes in Genesis you had Joseph a perfect man and money failed when Jesus came and money was the issue 30 pieces of silver the Rich Young Ruler you know and um a laborous worth his wage and all those things it's always money when a perfect man comes is there another perfect man now that we see money is falling I think so I think that there is a bride that's nearly near Perfection when God is going to let money fail again now let us again listen to brother brandham Lifeline the other morning well you know it's just like you sell Bonds on the go the bonds is already tuck up and this present government now is spending money for what for tax money that they'll be cut in 40 years from now she's done that's Lifeline right out of Washington DC Across the Nation taxes they're spending and trying to buy forign well they're just giving it out anyway don't you see that's exactly what they what they're going to do see what is it now if this nation goes busted the only thing it can do is go busted the only thing it can do is go bankrupt that's the only sensible thing to do change the currency but they won't do it under this presid Administration Roman Catholic Church owns a gold the world and what they'll do is sell out there you are that's what I am looking for now if you are spiritual you see what I'm going to say now kamla Harris is the first Domin Domino to fall you know if that first Domino Falls all the dominoes is falling so we waiting for that first Domino and when we see that all these things earthquakes and Pope and all that then comes into view that all of them isn't going to fall under the prophecy of one of the greatest prophets that ever struck the globe outside of Jesus Christ William mam branam may God bless his heart for giving us the signs of the time and taking all his time and go to Los Angeles and all those places to drop the prophecies that his master gave him so this is all prophecies hanging in the balance it's hanging there will she or Trump fulfill the prophecies will it be it's like a Dustin drum now beating is this behold I come quickly and my reward is with me Revelations 8:13 is then the next thing woe wo wo inhabitants of the earth three woes three world wars will that follow the first war the trumpet blew and got Israel back the second world world war was even worse and More in 1946 actually was going back and Israel became a nation and the third war is the atomic bomb that explodes and not only destroy America but the whole world Revelations 9:12 one war is passed One World War and behold there is coming actually two more WS Revelations 11:14 the second W is passed in other words the second world war is passed and behold the third world cometh quickly the third world war is come in quickly while the human is here Revelations 12:12 woe to the inhabitants of the earth woe unto us that's going to remain behind when that atomic bomb blast out so that's why I said three quarters of the six prophecy is fulfilled three qu quarters of it a woman as vice president fulfilled a woman's vote will put a in that seems also fulfilled Woman as a president she's a nominate she's a nominee now half of that is is fulfilled woman crew Time Magazine calls her you heard a badass woman tough as Nails fulfilled already woman will rule America she's ruling them now with even abortion it's three quarters fulfilled already we're waiting to see if she's going to do to be voted in the last thing that that must happen that last quarter will it be like that when all the others is already fulfill it will take a miracle for that not to happen if the other things already in the court has happened so El Tabernacle as we heard brother uh Bradley prayed it's to pray more you pray twice pray more four times you fasted once fast more and get spiritual get your mindset on only one thing the Lord Jesus Christ because that's all that we need to think about now because it is two desperate times that we are living in may God bless you thank you Nations up breaking Israel's

Good evening, saints, and special greetings to all the beautiful ladies of our tabernacle. We recently celebrated our woman's day in Christ Jesus. The team bloom where you are planted was featured. The atmosphere was electrifying and uplifting. What a blessed and amazing day we had. to tell you all nothing was outsourced. Our speakers, our caterers, our floristers, our decor ladies, everything proudly L tabernacle and we have received positive feedbacks from the sisters who attended. But now we have an an important announcement. With the woman month, women's month closing up, the apostle has thought it wise and requested that the book titled Just for the Ladies by Brother Brennan be made available to the L Tabernacle ladies. We want to share a few insights and on how this book can be a blessing to you to each one of you. And we have our dear loving sister Abigail here with us to elaborate on a few questions. Thank you for joining us sister Abigail. You're welcome sister. &gt;&gt; Sister Abigail um what are some of the insights as to how this book can help the sisters and what is the what is it that the apostle would like the sister to take from this book? &gt;&gt; Good evening everybody. Um, I think I need to start off with to say where this book originated from. Sister Rosco had a copy of this book and somehow it just got missing and God purposed it so that sister Joanie found a copy of the same book in the US and she gave it to us a couple of years ago. So when the seminar came up and um I saw the answers that the apostle gave it just pointed back to the book. So the apostle has twigged it a bit and we would like every sister to have a copy of it. So the book is based on questions that our precious uh prophet was asked and how he answered them. But it's targeted mainly to the ladies, the sisters. And it is in line with our doctrine, our belief, with many um scriptures added to the questions and the answers. And then the apostle what he wants us to take out of the book is the there's a lot of questions that the uh prophet answers by saying uh he doesn't have scripture to prove what he is saying but you need to make sure that your um your objective and your motives are right in anything you do as a Christian. So that's the main focus the apostle wants us to take because so many of the questions we receive the apostle doesn't really have scriptures for it but it is a matter of staying away from sin then coming closer to sin. So that's the main objective and then I think it is for us to bloom where we are planted. Beautiful. We're looking forward to it. Um just another question instead. Um what are some of the nuggets in the book that the ladies can look forward to to reading? Well, not to give a lot away. I think the book covers a lot covers how to be a good wife, a good mom. It covers a lot on dress code. It even covers on having unbelieving husbands. So I think there is so much nuggets for each one. It depends what applies to your life. So it applies for young and old and I think I will keep my nuggets to myself for you to enjoy your nuggets out of the book. So does that mean because I wanted to ask you on a personal note, what are the key concepts you personally enjoyed in this book? &gt;&gt; Well, for me I enjoyed the ending and the beginning of the book. the ending because um it speaks about menopause and that's what I'm going through now Mles unfortunately and I enjoyed the testimony that Rebecca Brandon gave that what her mom went through and I'd never known about that. I've read a lot of uh brother Brandon speaking on Wright's uh sister that was going through menopause. So to me that had a bit of a personal impact and I didn't realize that so many sisters went through the prayer line where the prophet prayed for them and I think the the nice part that Rebecca says her dad told her that her mom will be better off after this. So I'm looking forward to that part of being better off. And then I think it's the beginning of the book where they have a nice quotation where the prophet speaks about his wife and just to see how kind and gentle and loving the prophet was towards his wife. And he even says she's getting old now. But I love her the way I loved her back then. So that was remarkable for me because the prophet is always seen as somebody that was illuminated and to see the soft part when it comes to the sisters was remarkable. It just shows me how the apostle feels about us that he has a soft part when it comes to the sisters and how they get treated. So I think it's a good read and a mustave because everybody will be able to get something out of it. Oh, amen. Thank you so much, Sister Abby. As you all heard, this is a must readad and we want to thank you for your input and insight into the groups. There we have it, ladies. We really do appreciate our apostle, the leadership, the love they have for us and the care. Sisters, with all the wisdom that has been shared and will be shared by reading this book, don't miss out. Go and grab your copy. I think it will be a available at the combine titled just for the ladies. Be sure to get one. Thank you so much. God bless you. See you in the library. &gt;&gt; Bye &gt;&gt; bye.\n"}, {"id": "2023-08-31 - A Wedding Anniversary Tribute to Sis.

then you ought to know you love him last night we just had his word on the screen that was only my commands and if you keep those Commandments brother Branham told you to do it don't only read the

how do you know that he loves you now you know when you keep the word then you love him but how do you know how does he love you if he'll if he gives you the Holy Ghost it's a gift [Music] who knows he loves you how many of you got the holy ghosts [Music] [Applause] amen then he loves you he doesn't give it to anybody it's a gift you don't give a gift to everybody [Applause] that's why [Applause]

[Applause] I want to thank the brother that's in there SMS is in last night from Brazil even Botswana I didn't even mention Botswana last night even from Botswana I think by by 11 o'clock last night we had 1 500 viewers across the world I they never knew about langa but since we came here the whole world knows about London [Applause] and I thank God for the um those pastors out in Brazil that also sent in I don't know they must have had an interpreter there because every time they just say Gloria's [Applause] so we want to thank so many people that has I remember it's not the LT of an echo because we had services in every Church we're out of an equally so they were in church this is outside people [Applause] no one is saying if anybody in Cape Town would like to counter that I spoke last night I mean it's not my words it's brother branham's words [Applause] if they do count it you just urge me to come back again and straighten out but it will only be a fool that tries to come up against those quotes were laid down last night they can only do one thing [Applause] is repent and obey the quotes [Applause] that's why that's why I am not concerned when the people says well we got the word we got the word fine everybody's got the word even Rome's got all the tapes they all say have the word the devil also has the word in Matthew 4. 3 when he quoted back to the word the word everybody's not aware that's why I tell you this year the word is dead this word was in the beginning so let them preach in the beginning the word but we preached before the beginning [Applause] you're going to have a life first before the baby talk he needs to be alive and after a couple of months when his brain starts developing through his Spirit the brain is Spirit [Applause] than when the spirit is developed then the word come [Applause] so don't be taken up with people that speak about the word the word the word they don't even know what they're talking about [Applause] and then after your brain is developed your spirit is developed and you know because a word is a thought to express spirit where the spirit expresses the word if there's no spirit and the guys in saying he can't speak a proper word he misplaces the word because his spirit is deranged that's why if they misplace the word that means their spirit is deranged they matter misplaced dislocate [Applause] already preached already praised [Applause] the real world Jesus Christ right is Jesus the word and he only started to talk preach when he was 33 years old but he had to spread it all the time with him [Applause] amen I didn't touch my message so I'm going to try and touch it today [Applause] so let us just read the word of God in numbers again and what a blessing we had if you have given your heart to the Lord last night we we will be over anxious to baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ over anxious and we welcome you in this family [Applause] numbers 13. and they came unto the brook of ashko and cut down from things a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bear it between two upon a staff they put a a pole between the classical grapes how could they miss it I wonder that just that one cluster of grapes how much wine does it make God is telling Israel now I am going to make you drunk when you come into the land [Music] [Applause] God hates a sober Church a sober Church you're always as splits because the guys use the coconut to try and catch you but a drunk guy is just happy you just want the grapes that's all [Applause] can you see how the natural types the spiritual this quote is in the natural and in Acts 2 is the spiritual there the wine came down so how can they say the in the land and they sober can't be two guys said to me to carry it two guys the old in the New Testament will be governed by the grapes and they brought off the pomegranates and are fixed father I thank you for the reading of your word I hand this word into your hands I pray that you'll give me strength and a sound mind to preach this morning I'm so happy that I could work for you Lord so happy that you chose me to work father I am even more happy and glad and joyous that I can see I'm not doing God a service without being his will or his word the fruits of the work is hanging on the tree in front of everybody I hand over this leading into your hands and I pray o God that you'll bless your people when I was a young man I asked you help me to help your people the Lord for 57 years you helped me and I could help your people pray that you'd undertake for me in Jesus name you may be seated amen the fruit of the land and I'd like to start where I finished off last night with a quotation that I told you I love this quotation so very much the uncertain sounds I even print little cards and gave it to the church I told them if you go out and you visit other churches you want to know whether the church is the right Church then that church will have this quote manifested if it's not this quotation then you're in the wrong place look for the church that's got this and I just want the El Tabernacle have you got this [Applause] because you said every time God has a church it'll be this type of a church was the Pentecostal Church a noisy Church positive don't care [Applause] amen and out of an echo I hate a sober person in the church I like a person that forgets about himself [Applause] we don't have a boring Church we don't get bored here why because life is emotions is that right is that what brother Brown says so if you have the life of Jesus Christ in your life then you'll be full of emotions you can't help but praise the Lord you can't help but have prayed through meetings you can't help but have a fasting and a prayer you can but help amen dance in front of your critics even if your neighbor is in the church she'll be shocked how you act in church if we have Baptist people they'll be shocked because this quote says every time God has a church it'll be this type of a church Cape Town there's nothing you can do if your church is not this type of a church you are in the wrong Church you better get to a church that has these Karl Marx amen where people is free and the Holy Ghost comes down he that the spirit sets free is free indeed we know more back then the Baptist amen we're in the Pentecostal age [Applause] thank you if the bishop said if the bishop says if the bishop says if the bishop brother Beckett says anything else brother Branham says he's a liar because this quote has no uncertain sounds amen that's called it's got a real sound because they came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Winder amen and his sound like this quote I hear in this quote I want to tell you yes you are in this quote then let us rejoice and be glad for the lamb has made herself ready the spirit and the bride say come amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] then he says they all says well don't worry we've got the Holy Ghost we you know they preach on the Holy Ghost and they think that's all right to preach on the Holy Ghost but this quote knock everybody out he says if you say you got it if you say you got it the Bible Tabernacle says they've got it your brother Beckett says they've got it amen this is the evidence and the proof and the manifestation that you got it watch that brother bam says and you didn't act like that like what like the first church then how did the first church Act they spoke in pounds they danced they shouted [Applause] can you say Amen foreign act like that then there's something wrong with you there's something wrong there's something wrong with the bishop if you preach on the Holy Ghost and the people don't act like that then there's something wrong with him that's what the prophet says and I say what the prophet says so if the man preached on the Holy Ghost and say you've got the Holy Ghost and they never acted like that because brother pranam says that's the way Jesus acted he said Jesus acted that way amen so why don't they act that way but El Tabernacle you will act that way why because Jesus act that way why because Jesus is in you and if Jesus is in you you'll act that same way no other way no other baptism there's only one baptism and there's a baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is full of emotions brother pronounces foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] that's exactly what it said what what said that's what the Bible says not Bible Tabernacle not brother Beckett with his Baptist manners the Bible says it's a Pentecostal Menace because Pentecost started without an end and it's going on here because it's unto you and to your children and your children's children amen as many as the Lord called here is as many as the Lord called and we are acting the same way we are in the Bible this is the Bible amen we don't quote it we live it foreign [Music] [Applause] then the question comes up then what is the Holy Ghost you know now without it he doesn't know you they that don't have the spirit is none of Jesus none none but now if we have it [Applause] we need to know what how you're going to get it [Applause] the world is again falling apart and boy is it falling apart not even the world the churches is falling apart not even the churches the message is falling apart not even a message the foolish virgins is falling apart [Applause] but not the bride that has the oil the oil the oil make sure you've got the oil now instead of having to pick up the having preachers we've got lecturers man knows the word they know the word that's why I told you don't come to tell me where you got the word the word but otherwise it says the man's got a word another place he says this morning everybody is preaching the word so we passed the stage of the word we're at the stage of fulfilling the way [Applause] we passed the stage where the word was on paper we write now in the paper is turned into flesh and the word became flesh brother Brahm says your place that quote is in your flesh if that quote say dance and you dance that quote is in your flesh it's been made manifest [Music] it says they can sit there and put it together in such a way that it's astounding how they can do it they know the mechanics Ethel knows the mechanics brother Beckett knows the mechanics but then that ain't the Dynamics the mechanics the word that's not the Dynamics it's a mechanics what does he say can you read it for me we want not the word because he's a prophet you already lay down the word so you don't want the word you want the mechanics to go with the Dynamics or you want the Dynamics to work in the mechanics because the mechanics is there I don't have to prove the mechanics brother Branham already proved the mechanics I need the Dynamics to make the mechanics move to actually switch on the car and because all right you ought to shout the truth down you ought to run around this bowling that God gave you the Dynamics to go with the mechanics and make it pleasure again that you can walk with the word amen and talk with the word it has become the Dynamics of God we need the Dynamics and if the spirit of Jesus dwells in you it's gonna Quicken your mortal body and the Rapture will go oh my God now you now you finish this quote for me you finish this quote for me I don't I don't think that went into the third dimension of hell [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] my mind couldn't grasp it that a great prophet like that one of the greatest outside Jesus Christ could stand up and say a thing like that I don't care about the Bible the mechanics [Applause] now if he don't care I don't care brother Beckett because I had it for 57 years I know it I know the mechanics and nobody can tell me about the mechanics I know the mechanics everybody knows the mechanics this morning in the churches even the Roman Catholic Church they're going to open the Bible and read the mechanics but don't sit there they'll have the mechanics but they cannot have the dynamic say man we need the dynamic Hallelujah and what do you need Hey Brother Branham says he wants to know the Dynamics how come you don't want to know it brother Beckett amen I want to know it because I want to be like the prophet [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my [Applause] God can you imagine a proper says you want to know the Dynamics and little Pastor is just got nothing the Wonder Dynamics you make too much noise restoration I think page 34. brother Graham said you they say you make too much noise brother promises the Palm alone is it of the joy you're made too much noise [Applause] and what does he do it brings your joy unspeakable and what does it do they chase cigarettes out of your life and what does it do he Chase sin out of your life and what does he do he Chase these two things out of your life and what does he do it changes you from this and money devil amen and what does he do he changes from B want to be a bishop and you're not a bishop amen you're not even anything but you want to be that get the Holy Ghost then you'll know what you want to do what does he do that's what he does amen I love the old time Holy Ghost and the devil won't go near it that's all the reason people fear right it's good enough for me that's what he does amen oh Hallelujah I love the old-time Holy Ghost I love the old-time way I sing on my redeemer all the days of my life because I loved the old-time Dynamics amen and the Dynamics will make you run the Dynamics will strengthen your legs to jump a man that's what it will do it will make you stand on a street corner and Proclaim Jesus Christ as the king God of Our Lives amen [Applause] how do you know hey man let's take the next one reject Redemption in completion in joy they don't have joy anymore look at them sitting in Bible Tabernacle no joy and the Holy Ghost brings Joy I saw a brother sit here from Tabernacle just here amen with that brother standing and the whole time he just fit like this what's wrong with you guys that come from the Congo and UPS up South Africa you want to act like a bunch of white people we black people we like to toy toy man [Applause] [Music] when I see a black guy sitting like this I said this is a bird that's in a cage and proud of him since the cage is open and he doesn't want to fly out he loves the cage he will never get out of the cage but us as blacks Hallelujah we are brother we know [Music] can you say praise the Lord [Applause] now listen look what brother Brown says about the word look what he says about the word the one before this did we finish it no the one before this [Applause] oh yeah we finish it right now look what he says about the mechanics he says brother please read it just how you said I'm reading the wrong thing [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign that you can't even get up from your seat and say Amen brother bear said get up there and pick your heels together get a little Dynamics into your fifth word amen fast enough by the word freshen up by the word pattern up by the word he says you round the way you fetch you around you'll be sinned your stomach is so big you can't dance anymore foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I just can't help this can you read this quote for me brother [Applause] [Applause] are you having a good time then you're not setting up with

by the word aren't you happy with El Tabernacle aren't you happy you know Tabernacle then give me a minute of Praise if you are happy to be foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] mama mama [Applause] that turned off by the way fattened up by the way that's your faith oh my you're saying if you eat a lot and you go just give me one of those seeds here you add such a lot and you just sit you don't do anything if you want to go relax he says I'm feeling good relax eat and relax that's really hope and I'd say that she's almost around us around so it means is around and as a man saw around us if you are so fed that you're round did you ever hear a fit around man can say Amen can you ever get a 600 pound man or woman that so round fed that can dance you can't even walk from there till there can you see why they did they fattened up by the word now they can't even worship they can't even thank God they can't even thank God for the word they can't even thank God for sending a prophet they can't even thank God for saying Elijah is here they can't even say God for the prophecies that Elijah brought is getting pooped Russia is doing his own thing amen and the world is falling apart they can't even say Amen because they're round they're too fat amen they'll get a heart attack amen their lungs will hit close so they're going to go on sitting in the church threatened up by the word don't come and tell el Tabernacle about the word we want the Dynamics with a word [Applause] and you know what you as much as you want to and then after you eat and you start dancing you exercise you bring your weight down hallelujah amen and that's what we are doing praise God we worshiping God Amen we praising God and in the same time we're eating hallelujah we're eating the word in the same time we do two things in one amen we don't go sit down on our bed amen and our lazy backseat man and can't get up from your seat and come to the front and say amen hallelujah to take the weight down [Applause] give me the next one the token listen here now the token the Dynamics but Israel any Bible student knows that Israel was a type of the church exactly to the promised land and that's where she is turning to to the promised land if Ten Commandments and uh and Mount Sinai and and pull off fire and pull off cloud and uh the rock giving the war to all that is all right but that was just the journey to get to the promised land [Applause] The Ten Commandments was only the journey to get to the promised land now they still in in the journey we have crossed over in 1979 did you hear me we crossed over 1979. [Applause] they saw what justification sanctification justification said we in the baptism of the Holy Ghost as he says underscore [Applause] [Music] but when the evening time comes Wednesday evening time now and the journey was on there was one solemn requirement one after all that after having Moses the Ten Commandments the Smith and Rock Amen the raising of the serpent for healing in the wilderness after all that amen mounts and I after all that the cloud after all that the pull of fire after all that amen there's one requirement after all that after Moses there's one requirement one how many requirements no matter how much Jew he had been regardless of how he says I'm the bride I mean yeah brother says there's brides and brides and he bride regardless if you're a Jew how well you had kept his crops how well he had taken care of the neighbors how much he had done how good a member he was good Amendment Church I stick with brother back as you know and also go to hell with brother Beckett without the Holy Ghost God has no friends when it comes to the Token he even wanted to kill brother brainer took his wife took his shoulder and all that and who's Brother Beckett and brother Branham just sympathized with a Baptist Doctrine not preaching the weapon of the back of preaching hot what a chance does he spend when he dies no chance God can keep me accountable for that I can't see brother Brandon being stroked and really nailed down twice for rejecting the Holy Ghost not rejecting it but compromising with his mother-in-law the other time God straightened him out is when he those Pentecostals came into the church and it started to dance with the tambourine and all that and brother Branham says well you know where I come from I was Baptist I don't believe in this they're making my church a Tavern I'm coming to that and God says what are you sitting in the seat of a scornful Branham [Music] [Applause] he rebuked him twice [Applause] because brother Abraham's first a part of his ministry was baptized against Sensations against uh uh uh uh the the dancing he says I was against it I didn't like it emotions he was against it that was his first part of his ministry he came out with the Baptist idea and all those quotes in the beginning was Baptist but at the end when he asked to be the Elijah of Malachi 4 yet to say Pinnacle starts without a name he had to change [Applause] no matter how much he had done how good a member he was how much titles tithes he paid all these things was fine that was okay he was a good man recognized amongst his people as a good man but just read that so how is brother Becca going to make when brother Brown says without the Holy Ghost Shall Perish oh don't go to the Grave like that brother Becca you're going to have a pleasant surprise this quote is going to nail your height amen set the people free brother Roscoe you're an apostle of God straighten out the thing tell the people I'm in Cape Town and I'm telling you by the quotes [Applause] don't perish with them that is perishing get out from among my people and do not be partakers of their sin that's where the Holy Ghost is it's where the dancing is get away from them that's threatened by the word no how do you know you have got it palm oil locusts Cancun and caterpillar I think it's phase 30. listen what he says there is no place in the Bible where they ever receive the Holy Ghost without having emotions [Music] no place no place and they say we the word the word the word but brother Brahm says no place in the word where anybody ever received the Holy Ghost without emotions [Music] [Applause] so if you receive the Holy Ghost without emotions that means you've got another Holy Ghost but not this one not Malachi Falls Holy Ghost the only place that has this Holy Ghost is here Tabernacle so you're in the right place [Music] you in the right place you in the right place [Applause] [Music] do you believe you're in the right place foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] not having emotions no place with with brother Becker foreign [Applause] that any of you can show me on tape that they spoke in tongues in Bible Tabernacle or in Georgia's Tabernacle then there is no Holy Ghost there if they didn't receive it like this then they don't have the Holy Ghost now I can tell you brother back had never receive it like this he comes from me unknown and he stopped it in his church he quenched the Holy Ghost it's times that he had the Deacon stand there if you say too much amen they he tells the deacons to tell you to shut up and sit quenching quenching quenching the Holy Ghost but in real Tabernacle quench him in to throw water on the Fire but in El Tabernacle we threw petrol on the Fire and we made it a wild fire [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm gonna skip a lot of my notes I'm late amen I'm late the land ball pomegranate a fruit when they came back they had the grapes and they had pomegranate grenades pomegranate is a fruit that's got a lot of seeds in [Music] but those seeds is in a fluid a red fluid the seed the word is right in the token the Holy Ghost God is telling Israel now you're coming to a land that will have the Dynamics and the mechanics foreign so when we preach here in the land we preach pomegranate seeds in the token seeds in red fluid see it's in the blood see it's not crisis Brother Francis there was Christ seeds going up into the upper room and when it got into the upper room down come the red fluid the token to cover the seed amen while we are preaching here hallelujah amen but right through it covers the preaching amen and after 10 years you can come back and you can see that it's so fresh amen because the token makes the seed fresh say Amen somebody [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] every message that's preached in El Tabernacle a man is embedded in red fluid the token because the Dynamics keeps the mechanics fresh when you take the manner out of the fluid out of the holy of holies out of the presence of God the manner gets tail but put the Manna back into the red fluid with the power of God is where the Holy Ghost is where the dove is where the comforter is amen then that old seed never gets old whether it's the eagle message whether it's what message amen this message can't go stale why it's imperative red thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] El Tabernacle aren't you glad to be an El Tabernacle foreign [Applause] [Music] you're eating

the word of God not only quoting but living it and I'm going to make sure they live it because I'm gonna dump it in red fluid the token the Holy Ghost the Dynamics amen the Darth the quickening power

apart that means that there is without a shed of a doubt that the world is going to have a traumatic climate change which they have never seen before we want to always know what is in the future what is there to follow covered 19. it is unequivocal that human activities are responsible for climate change that's the finding of a new study by the un's intergovernmental panel on climate change it's the most up-to-date assessment of how global warming will change the world in the coming decades environmental experts have called it a massive wake-up call to governments to cut emissions 234 authors from 66 countries have worked on the landmark assessment the report says global average temperature rise could reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next 20 years now that is 10 years sooner than expected that temperature rise will breach the ambition of the 2015 Paris climate agreement and bring widespread Devastation and unprecedented extreme weather this all comes less than three months before the cop 26 climate conference in Glasgow in Scotland vital un talks that will determine the future course of efforts to tackle climate change and the UK Minister responsible for delivering cop 26 has released this statement following the publication of today's report he says our message to every country government business and part of society is simple the next decade is decisive follow the science and embrace your responsibility to keep the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius alive our environment and energy analyst Roger harobin has more wildfires blazing through Greece and Turkey have horrified people in the region the panel concludes we'll see a lot more fires as temperatures continue to rise and Rise they will as greenhouse gas emissions keep growing and growing The increased heat will change weather patterns bringing more droughts and more rainfall researchers say London was shocked to find areas underwater a few weeks ago rainfall patterns are hard to predict but experts say northern Europe will be wetter overall at London's Hampstead ponds they've already had to raise and reinforce the dams to protect hundreds of homes Downstream from the sort of floods expected in extreme rains that are forecast to come the cost has been huge we're already paying the price of ignoring scientists warnings on climate change so this report States as an absolute fact that human influence is warming the climate and that's a very Stark reminder that it is our activities which are changing the climate and affecting these extreme weather events um and as the planet continues to warm these consequences just get worse ice in the Arctic is melting faster than many scientists predicted that leads to sea level rise which in turn increases coastal flooding the Seas will keep Rising for maybe thousands of years because the ocean deep has absorbed so much heat already political attitudes are changing the UK is getting electric cars we need clean technology for home heating too in the words of one leading scientist we're not doomed but if we want to avoid catastrophe we have to drastically cut emissions now Roger harobin BBC News Valerie Masson delmot is a climate scientist and co-chair of one of the ipcc working groups which produce the Climate Change Report she said the threshold of keeping the global temperature at 1.5 degrees Celsius limit will be breached around 2050. the report shows that in the next 20 years global warming the average temperature at the Earth's surface over a period of 20 euros is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above the late 1800s however if we rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions if we can reach global net zero CO2 emissions around 2050. it is extremely likely that we can keep global warming well below 2 degrees if we do this it is more likely than not that temperature would gradually decline to below or around 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century with a temporary overshoot of no more than 0.1 degrees Celsius but if Global greenhouse gas emissions remain around today's levels in the coming decades we would reach two degrees of global warming by the middle of this century we joined Now by Tamsin Edwards a climate scientist and one of the authors of this report welcome to BBC News I know your area of expertise is the oceans and sea level change and in fact you spent three years investigating this haven't haven't you so it would be remiss of me not to um find out more about that what did you find exactly well that's right we have over 200 authors um in the whole report we have uh looked at 14 000 scientific studies over three years and I work on ice sheets and sea level rise as you say we don't do new research we assess the robustness of the evidence so for example for the Antarctic ice sheet we looked at the range of possibilities of the future of the ice sheet and therefore its contribution to sea level rise and one of your findings is that the melting of Greenland glaciers is irreversible am I right well that's right so there are different parts of um there are different uh Ice uh regions around the world we have the glaciers of the mountains and the polar regions and we have the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica the mountain and polar glasses are particularly sensitive and we have already committed to further melting over the next decades to hundreds of years we're also going to see more ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet over the next Century over this century and for the Antarctic ice sheet there's a really wide range of possibilities if we limit greenhouse gas emissions we may be fortunate and have a relatively low contribution to sea level rise but if we have very high greenhouse gas emissions and we're unlucky with how sensitive that ice sheet is we could see very high sea level rise indeed so at my right that the message is there's no going back from some change once they've melted they can't be refrozen I assume but there is a core optimism that this could be slowed or indeed even halted or is that putting it too optimistically we think that the the mountain and polar the mountain and polar Glaciers are these smaller glaciers and also Arctic sea ice um could have some reversible changes so if we limit warming and eventually reduce uh temperatures further that those could regrow and restore to some degree the ice sheets are much slower to respond so Greenland and Antarctica will keep responding for hundreds if not thousands of years and combined with the warming of the ocean which makes it expand and contribute to sea level rise that means sea levels are going to remain elevated for thousands of years I was very struck by what Inga Anderson said the executive director of the UN environment program she said scientists have been telling us for over three decades of the dangers of allowing the planet to warm the world listened but did not hear and I wondered do you think government and people will it's a difference isn't it between taking any notice of this and doing something about it of course I mean speaking personally you know I I do sense a real shift in the in the conversation over the last few years but I think what this um ipcc assessment report shows it's much more comprehensive than ever before assessed more of the scientific evidence than ever before obviously the timing with respect to the cop 26 meeting later this year it really shows that if we do have immediate rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions we can still limit warming to one and a half degrees uh above the sort of late 1800s as we've heard without much overshoot and eventually go to lower warming again but if we don't um enact the policies and pledges that we already have in place and in fact if we don't make those stronger then we won't meet that Target but what are your conclusions about reducing those greenhouse gas emissions and keeping temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels Can it can it be done well this particular part of the ipcc report is called the working group one report which is around the science of climate change and so we looked at different scenarios of emissions and what that would mean for climate change what we need to look out for next year is the third working group which looks at mitigation in other words where are those emissions coming from what are the different Pathways to cutting those emissions so that will give much more of that detail about exactly the how of cutting emissions whereas what this report is doing is showing the implications of very low emissions or medium intermediate emissions or very high what that actually implies for the extreme weather for the sea level rise and other changes in climate no I understand that's really useful tams in Edwards climate scientist at King's College London and one of the authors of the report thanks so much for your time so what can be next after covert that is the problem what is going to be next after this news flesh the biggest thing that must happen is climate change then the coming of the Lord amen [Music]\n"},

on on price when we told the church it's actually double that amount that chis gave us but uh we think that God is going to help us to cover it so I think we will be covered uh until the deck you know as far as the money is concerned and then after that is uh the bricks to build the sanctuary on top of this so uh it's going um towards um our plans the way we wanted it and uh and the weeks to come is going to be very interesting because then we're going to start uh with a deck and uh from there it's just uh brick on brick for 2 m for the sanctuary and uh we have to come down again when the deck is thrown to actually um speak about the sanctuary there's few things that we need to take out to actually enlarge the the sanctuary so we we are very pleased that we could come down at this juncture and uh we really uh excited because uh we can see the hand of the Lord moving and you know brother sister we see a little dust fly from off the mountain know that the mountain is going to move so this is more than a little dust that is um flown from this mountain so uh that makes us so um so happy and uh inspiring so uh we urge you to please uh you know after the the deck is the bricks so we want to really ask the people to really dig in a pocket so that we can cover the bricks and then once we cover the bricks and we can see the end of this whole thing thank you I am so honored and blessed to be in the turb and Al have aacle parking Bay as we stand here this morning we are standing under C it's going to go up to the sanctury it's just something to see the water it's Bor in and as the Bible

Branham\u2019s hands, \nas Aaron and Hur \nheld up Moses\u2019 hands...  \n\nSo does this Rabbi come behind it all, \nto lift up Bro Branham\u2019s hands!\n\n\nExodus 17:12 - But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, \nand he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, \nand the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.\nTRANSCRIPT\n========================================\nhow many Christian exchange brandom for a medium for an antichrist for a false prophet for a deceiver how can it be what a mental perversion what a spiritual Madness what a religious foolishness now if John the Baptist was more than a prophet and John did not operate any healing Miracles or any Wonder but he simply announced the arrival of the Messiah what about then the ministry of William ranam who in addition to the great wonders and the wonderful and Powerful Miracles that he performed and the signs and the visions and the prophecies and The Apparition of angels and the pillar of of of cloud and the voice from Heaven and the opening of The Seven Seals and beside all this his ministry that forun the Rapture of the bride and the second coming of the Lord H what about the ministry of branam branam who who discerned the thoughts of men's heart in all details branam who commanded the demon to leave the sick and the disease disappeared Bram who called the dead to life and during his ministry seven dead people resurrected branam who received visions that came to pass to the letter Bram who interpreted the dreams of the people without them telling him the dream but first he told them what they had dreamed and then he gave them the interpretation like Daniel did Bram whom the angel of the Lord spoke face to face Bram whom the Lamb of God opened the Seven Seals and revealed to him the contents Bram through which Ministry God did many all those wonderful things is therefore branam more than a prophet yes he is more than a prophet I firmly believe that anyone who says a single word against this Prophet or against the message that he preached it will never be forgiven never forgiven why not be forgiven given because he who speaks against this work of the Holy Ghost in This man does not speak against the man but against God against the Holy Spirit and this is a blasphemy yes one of these days the Bride of Jesus Christ will be taken away and you will be left here in the Great Tribulation where there will be weeping nashing of teeth if you reject the ministry of William ranam you have rejected Jesus Christ himself why because it was the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ that was working through William Marian branam did not Jesus said that whosoever receives the one that he sends receives Jesus and did not Jesus said that whosoever rejects the one that he sends rejects Jesus if you reject this ministry of branam one of these days you will say the same thing that the Jews said in front of Jesus crucified truly this man was the son of God they recognized him too late they recognized him after they had rejected him and crucified him him remember it is not what you say of ranam that determinates who is William branam no but it is what you say of branam that determines what you are and what will be of you I concluded by repeating the question what do you say of William Mariam BR if you do not know anything about the ministry of William branam I suggest you to visit the sites that you will find Hereafter investigate examine search the scripture do not stand on here say will you listen to my heartfelt advice will you be humble enough in your spirit to examine the preaching of William ranham comparing it not with the belief of your denomination but with the Bible or you want to be part of that large number of believers who say Lord Lord but do not do the will of God and Jesus on that day not now will cast you away from his presence telling you that he has never known you as it is written in Matthew 7 verse 23 I leave it to you the [Music] choice\n"}, {"id": "2022-10-14 - I Magnify My Office - The Word Is Not Enough  Apostle Edgar H.

regarding the Catholic Church, drawing connections between these statements and the prophetic vision and quotes of the Prophet William Marrion Branham.\nTRANSCRIPT\n========================================\nokay well we greet you again and again again in The Only Name That's blessed only name that's glorified only name that bears life Jesus king God we um a GL GL again happy to make this recording and um so that you Al bacle people may know the hour and the time and what's going on as I told uh the family about what I see last night on TV about Visionaries people that can look in the future and decipher what is coming what is going to happen and we know that's Bible the Bible says without Vision the people perish so um that's why we feel that we want to do this clip before the elections on Tuesday of the uh presidency of the United States we U Know That U now that there's two things running here the Roman Catholic church and Camila we just want to focus on Trump and play the clips of trump uh with the Roman Catholic church and his commence about the Roman Catholic church and um never before was it taken into consideration and asking for the Catholics to vote and putting them on a pedestal where Trump has put them under so when we mentioned this in the previous Clips I know it was a shocker because it shocked me when I saw there's two possibilities here with this elections and uh and I saw the Roman Catholic church and uh whether it goes camil camil's way whether it goes Trump's way it just don't look good so um Trump as made the statements and we want to play it to you so that you know even before Tuesday either of them spells chaos to the world so uh I hope you enjoy it I hope your eyes open I hope you see it I hope you go dissect the quote End quotes on the Roman Catholic church we know that such a those scriptures that stand behind that Revelation 17 and Mark of the Beast Revelations 13 America and uh Rome together so I want my people to know exactly what's taking place and I like what somebody else says he says well remember if it don't come to pass there's still another election in front of us the prophet stands and I want to say why because in spite of the the prophecy and the vision it might ter but it says wait for its fulfillment now we've waited 91 years for this prophecy could it be the time and uh uh we saw that the Jubilee 1th Jubilee has finished last week and Friday we seen what happened with the bombing of U um uh the [Music] CH and um and I also would like to say uh Monday that pass was also a good date for us because that was the date when brother Bram laid hands on me in um maranata Park so everything was a cluster everything was together so I pray that uh this will be a blessing for you amen thank you from that time brother Bram says 1960 the 7 month 16th day he says thus saith the Lord in other words God said it not brother brandham God said it there'll be a woman rule a woman rule before the end time listen here before the end time she'll either be president or vice president or the Roman Catholic Church listen there's three important points in this quote Point number one before the end time why does he say before the end time because the seventh vision is the end time the a Bor the seventh trumpet Revelations 11:14 the the Third Woe cometh quickly it comes quickly after her that's the end remember that so her coming in is not the end of the world get me straight please but the bride is gone then when this happens when the bomb Falls when that wo comes remember the bride is gone before the end of the world in other words she won't see the end of the world so brother BR says a woman will rise she'll be he says she'll be president or vice president well she's running for both she already fold the one she is and was the vice president and now she's running to be a candidate for presidency so the quote is running with God's will so far we're going to bring this back again to you her rise was 1990 Deputy district attorney 2000 courtroom prosecutor Francisco 20 uh 2003 district attorney 2010 general attorney 2016 US senator 2020 elected vice president 2024 president candidate isn't the scary straight with the quote anybody can see this could it be El Tabernacle could it be so the quote is running with God's will so far from the same quote from that time he says or the Catholic church so here we see distinctly two woman a natural woman that will be voted in and a spiritual woman which is the Roman Catholic Church that's not voted in she just comes in but the natural woman that will be president she gets voted in so I never saw this just the other day and as I went through the quotes and I think there's about 200 or so many quotes or even more uh and all if you read really those quotes you'll see he speaks every time of two woman that's why we have two candidates for the two woman one is Trump and the other one is Camila one will be Camila that is voted in so far we see how her votes went the other one might be Trump that will let the Roman Catholic Church come in because of the pressure of the Roman Catholic church because America owes her trillions of dollars they can't even pay back the interest so will she put the screws on Trump if he he gets elected and he will give in then to her and afterwards speak as the dragon it's two scenarios here because the Roman Catholic Church when he says the Roman Catholic Church he says I got it in Brackets and you know what that mean I don't have to take it to school so um he says all the Catholic Church two woman then he concludes the quote by saying thus saith the Lord so it must come to pass is this the season for it you might have to check that thing out president Trump we are so honored to have you join us in in front of this very very important faith summit uh you are my friend and I am so blessed to have been a part of your life some people don't know for over 24 years as a part of I feel not only family but you're pastor and an advisor and I got to work in the White House and represent people Faith as senior advisor to Faith initiative and opportunity one of the greatest honors ever we have thousands of pastors here and Faith leaders and their number one issue that they want to know about is what about your faith we're going through a lot of problems in our country if you take a look at the anger the the uh the problems that we have and a lot of it is that it's less based on religion now than it was 25 years ago and 50 years ago and I mean we were a really people would say a Christian and really religious even other Faith's country and that seems to be heading in the wrong direction and I think as that goes goes uh down I think that our country goes down I really do I think this is a country that needs religion it's like the glue that holds it together and we don't we don't have that that's why you are the most important people and I'm not sure you even realize it and they're trying to hurt you they're trying to sty you this new Administration this new uh radical left group of people and it's not so new it's been around for a while and uh there are people that are not nice people if you're if you happen to be Catholic we don't have too many Catholics here maybe but boy they are trying they are persecuting Catholics I actually said how could a Catholic possibly vote for Kamala how could that I know the level of anger and the level of uh vitrio you know when you see uh what's going on with the FBI and the Catholic church I say what is happening and you know the expression is that you're next because they're all everybody's next next with this group and they have a very bad agenda and we have to stop it and we have to win this election I think winning this election I think it's going to be the most important election in the history of our country absolutely thank you everybody well thank you very much it's an honor and we are doing well by the way the votes are starting to come in you got to get out and vote and Catholics you got to vote for me just remember you better remember I'm here and she's not I could have done that too but you do something that's incredible the Catholic Church you're helping the poor educating children and supporting the vulnerable all polls are indicating I'm leading big with a Catholic vote as I should be as I should be I want to thank the Al Smith foundation for its Noble work and I want to express my tremendous gratitude to the Catholic Community it's a great Community it's a community I've gotten along with all my life I tell you when I was when I was President I was in the Oval Office and I got a call from the Cardinal and he said we need help it was during the China virus I want to be accurate when I describe it and he said we need help our schools are in devastating shape they needed much more than a billion I won't even tell you the number but much more than a billion dollars but I've known the community and I've known the the schools I knew I know so many people that were educated in the Catholic school system and they are great and they just speak with it like with love much more so than almost any system that I've seen and he said sir we have uh a big problem we need a number of billions of dollars or we're going to have to close down the New York school system the whole system in New York and I said give me 15 minutes I think I can find it and we gave him billions of dollars and you know what he stayed open and they thrive and to this day I hear you did just about the best job there is in education so and that was always an honor that was always and every time he sees me he says thank you very much I said I know what you're talking about but we work together we were a good partnership right we got that money in about 15 minutes billions and uh it was put to very good use but I just want to thank everybody this is a special evening Less Than 3 weeks to go till election day here in the United States and the race for president appears to be tightening there's a new National Catholic Reporter poll showing Trump up among Catholics in five of the seven swing States tonight the former president and current GOP candidate talks with me again about the issues important to people of Faith about life and those multiple assassination attempts we met at the 79th annual Al Smith dinner for the arch dasis of New York a dinner his opponent vice president kamla Harris has declined to attend here's my exclusive interview with President Donald J Trump Mr President I'm delighted first of all that you made the Downtown Abbey auditions we I think we're going to fit in nicely we're at the alith dinner of course tell me why did you decide it was important to be here and what message is kamla Harris sending by not being here to Catholic voters well I think you're honoring the Catholic church and you know I've been uh long time supporter and I'm surprised she's not here I think she's the first one in many many in decades actually to miss it as a candidate it was always been a tradition so I'm happy only that the Catholics are going to vote for Trump now but uh no it's look I have a special relationship with the Catholic church and I uh I think it was very important to be here yeah uh I've been noticing on your social media posts on your at your rallies you're playing the a Maria you're posting happy birthday Mary a St Michael prayer to ward off evil is that telling voters something about your spiritual journey what is that no I don't think it's just beautiful to me I mean I I look at the whole thing the words and the pictures the pictures are so beautiful and uh yeah I put up some stuff somebody else asked me that same question and it's really that I think it's really very beautiful okay in 2020 you told me I am a pro-life candidate in the interim you got rid of roie Wade and you've said I've returned it to the states and people have to follow their heart some of your supporters is saying well Trump is pro-choice now what would you say to them no no uh I am like Ronald Reagan before me the exceptions are very important to me and that's the life of the mother rape and incest and uh not at all I'm very proud of what we did everybody wanted it to be back in the States where it belongs and the states are voting and frankly some of the votes are very liberal by comparison to what people may have thought but it's now back in the States it's an issue that's torn the country apart for 52 years and now uh and everybody wanted it Democrats Republicans conservatives uh liberals everybody and all legal Scholars wanted it back in the States and now we did that and I have to tell you I give great credit to brilliant Supreme Court Justices we had six brilliant Supreme Court Justices and uh they had great courage and I think the country will now come together will you rein at the Mexico City policy which forbids International spending on abortion well I was the only one that did that as you know no other president did that and we're going to be giving that a very good serious look in other words how that compares and competes with the states but we'll be giving that a very serious look the other day you said I'm the father of IVF as you know some Catholics feel and the Catholic Church believes when you implement this technology you're killing embryos will you have a religious exemption to your IV F mandate for religious organizations and businesses that feel this violates my religious principle well you know I haven't been asked that but it sounds to me like a pretty good idea frankly but uh even Catholics a lot of them they want IVF it's fertilization basically and uh you know they view that as helping a family helping uh parents have a child and it's a very popular thing but certainly if there's a religious uh problem I think people should go with that I should be I I really think they should be able to do that but we'll look at that have an exemption well I got to look I got to get some new ones in here KLA Harris is changing her tactic against you she said to Brett Bear my colleague the other night you president Trump are targeting Americans uh you're calling them the Enemy Within and you're turning the military on the American people you and I both know that he has talked about turning the American Military on the American people he has talked about going after people who are engaged in peaceful protest he has talked about locking people up because they disagree with him this is a democracy your reaction to that and what did you mean when you said the Enemy Within well it's ridiculous that she says that they turning the military these are the really these are the threat to democracy people like actually like her with her language you know she's the most liberal senator in the Senate uh not as smart as most of them but she's certainly more liberal and she likes to say that turning the military how ridiculous is it but I will say this uh the enemy from within we do have an enemy from within we have people that uh are I think more danger to our country when you see the radical left programs that they're espousing and uh we have a a true enemy from within they hate when I say that but whether we like it and I think in many ways it's more dangerous from the outside enemies that we have I want to talk about immigration for a moment the church teaches welcome The Immigrant it also teaches that a nation has a right to protect it borders for the common good how do you president Trump balance welcoming The Immigrant with locking down the border and the deportation promise You' made well as you know we had the strongest borders we've ever had just four years ago we had the most powerful the strongest we let people in but they have to come illegally and I don't think that's changed we want people to come into our country but they have to come illegally uh as you know they allowed people to come in from prisons and frankly murderers the 13,099 murderers where they were let out of prison and convicted murderers and some killed more than one person some killed more than five people and they're now free in our country and we're going to have to get them out and we're going to get them out fast nobody wants that no I want to have people come into our country legally but we have to have strong borders and good elections did you see this lip reader when Joe Biden and Barack Obama were on the side of Ethel Kennedy's funeral this lipr reader who's a forensic expert claims Joe Biden said she's not as strong as I I am was it a mistake to trade KLA Harris for Joe Biden in your opinion well we seem to be winning and we were way up in Joe we had the debate and the numbers were very strong and I just see numbers that are very similar right now they're very similar so we'll see what happens I hope we win because we want to make America great again yeah and and your record of religious liberty how important is that to you religious liberty uh it's a stance that I've taken from the beginning and I'll keep it I wouldn't change it for anything okay final question the pope was asked about your candidacy and kamla Harris and he instructed Catholic voters to vote for the lesser of two evils who do you think he means and why well I think he wants them to vote for me and I stand for really everything that you stand for and that the church stands for and she doesn't she's a a very different kind of a person she's a Marxist her father was a Marxist and still is a Marxist and they are not big into religion I will tell you and I'm not just talking about the Catholic religion I'm talking about any religion uh the whole Democrat Party has gone really radical left and I'm the opposite I am totally in favor of religion and I also like the Catholic Church a lot and I also like the Catholic Church a lot and I also like the Catholic Church a lot thank you Mr President what a pleasure we'll see you soon thank you [Music]\n"}, {"id": "2025-10-24 - Special Friday

The first prayer request [music] reads as it said, \"God bless saints. Can the saints please pray for my for my son. He's suffering from [music] her disease. May the God of Eaban make a way as he been suffering for five years.\" Sister Mickey. The next one reads as it said God [music] blessings of the living God in in human flesh.

I would like to thank God for safe traveling mercies. And I would like to [music] thank God for being so good to me and my family always handing always handing us under hiding us under his wings [music] from sister. There's an unwritten prayer request. Can the reverently lift our hands believing the Lord will make a way for us tonight as we approach the throne of grace. Great and eternal heavenly father, the most high God, the one who was, the one who is, and the one who [music] is to come. &gt;&gt; Father God, we say thank you tonight, Lord God, that we can live in the days of Dian Apostle at the U Ros. Father God, surely but surely, he is that thunder that shakes the skies. He is the voice of God that makes the skies to tremble. He is the five-fold ministry, Lord God. Heavenly Father, as we can recall, Lord God, he was a elder died five times, Lord God, and the ministry gave him a new heart, Lord God. He was a young man, Lord God, blind, and the ministry prayed for him and eyeballs fall back into his sockets, Lord God. Somewhere in Brazil, a woman lost the arm in an accident, Lord God. And while the ministry preached, the arm grew back, Lord. So, Father God, here's the prayer request tonight. Lord God, [screaming] we pray before the throne of God. Lord God, you told the prophet if you can get this people to believe you, Lord Canel will stand before you. The greater than William Prenam is here tonight, Lord God.

in your homes just sing the stream Lord and He uted these words saying this Bullit is The Mercy Seat of e [Music] Tabernacle Lord help me Lord help me Lord help me he says what is the bullpit is to pull you out of the butt and there was an angel in E Tabernacle that pulled me out of the butth Hallelujah I was a good for nothing I was hopeless but there was another Angel another Angel and I say another Angel and I want to say that angel is no other than [Music] Rosco and the another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden sensor and there was given unto him much in sense that he should offer it with the praise of the Saints unto the golden altar which was Before the Throne there's an angel in E Tabernacle that takes our prayers and he mixes it with sweet smelling Savor so that when it comes to the altar it comes to the presence of God he cannot help but turn and he and look where that good smell comes from but it's all because of that angel of this SP and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hands and the angel took the scent and filled it with fire of the Altar and casted into the Earth and there were voices and thunderings and Lightnings and earthquake when this Angel comes in to [Music] your needs your desires the whole Earth and Heaven shakes at the same time may God add a blessing to the reading of his word [Music] hallelujah the 28th of [Music] February it was a happy visitation day the 28th of February was when the cloud appeared and in Revelations 10:1 it says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and here is that Mighty Angel clothed with a cloud his clothes is a cloud Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the most high God and this [Music] was 2001 in maranata park where that angel was blowing the [Music] trumpet want to play you one clip [Music] Hallelujah God bless everyone I pray that you have a good day with God today brother brandham says when you want to get closer to God you pray and you read your Bible so where you were last week and this week it's two different levels that you can get so if you want to get more closer to God you're going to have to pray and remember what the Apostle said when you pray pray some part of you goes to the throne and God recognizes your voice and he says I know that voice that's my child speaking to me now and while you speaking he listens because you're part of him and by him recognizing your voice in prayer he will answer your prayer because he knows you are on the earth and you're going through a trial going through a hard time you are in a battle but he knows he's with you in the battle but he wants you to cry to him and when you cry out to him remember the answer is already on the way he says in the Millennium before you ask he will answer and it's already we are right there now that before we even ask God anything he already has worked out the answer because all things Works to together for the good to them that love the Lord so remember your prayer this Tuesday he's already answered but he wants you to ask so do the leadership and yourself of favor ask God today and then see if the answer comes and if the answer comes then you thank him for the rest of the week for answering your prayer cuz he's looking for an an excuse for you to talk to him he's every day looking for an excuse for you to meditate on him he's looking for an excuse to heal from you and you have a way to God's thrown by the representative on the earth so how come God cannot answer your prayer when he already sent somebody so that your prayers can be answered the Apostle praise you pray it's done Satan it's done House of hell it's done you just got to open your mouth buy your subconscious mind pray and God knows your voice God bless [Music] [Music] you spend time in the presence of God uh that man spends time with Jesus Christ that man hears from the Throne of God hallelujah he's under the unction and God wants more young men like that even if they said that you cannot pray he says I cannot pray that's my hour prayer no but the king said you I don't care what the king says I am going to pray Hallelujah young people God wants you to pray God wants you to [Music] [Applause] [Music] pray God bless you I just want to say this before we go into the prayer session just remember this that God's Apostle he moves in two Dimensions at the same [Music] time so I want show you that this holy ghost that is in this place can move in your homes wherever you are this morning you will feel the you will hear the footsteps of that angel because he can be here and there at the same time as we bow our heads and close our eyes [Music]

Yes. in Matthew 12. &gt;&gt; You know even the ones who are outside their eyes on this. &gt;&gt; So what we say we must have the evidence. My I know you passed this Bible. This Bible became flesh. This Bible is a man because the former Brenham tabernacle didn't come with words only. But when that prophet was in the tabernacle, that was of the former reign on two feet. When he preached the unveiling of God, he said, \"Know me. What about the greatest? What about this? What about this last chocolate in the box? Because brother Brennham says hallelujah when dead man comes I will close my doors I will take my people double knock I will take brenham hallelujah amen hallelujah and show them the man so brother Benham desire was to live in distant time because when he showed the man in Maranata park he discerned that boy. This is not a normal boy because this boy this was the voice that spoke to me because brother Brandham say I didn't see the angel but 1946 for the first time for the first time for the first time for the first time the prophet see him face to face in this angel 1946 and and church born on the same date. Amen. Brother of the prophet's daughter why to show the world this man have only one lady because a woman is a church and she can't preach. You need a man that turn the cloud who believe our report only because you was in the conference with this man. That's why he blessed you in your room by your work. He blessed you in present. He blessed you. You are an a lot of level. We can't come down. Heat. Heat. What we preach is in the Bible. What is the Bible says? When the oil came down on the house, Amen. and God can. Amen. Then God must reveal himself and the Holy Ghost. The oil came down 1979. How can the devil tell this church we don't see God? Who can he say? We see God behind the bullpin. Not only behind the spool pit, but when he sit there, when he walk there, we see the behavior, the character of is the oil for the countries. 40 countries. 40 countries. Then God take the mass off face to face. Now we're getting excited here. I jumped the car even. Sorry, brother. Can you give me the code? We have the scripture. Can you give me the code? The code? Yes. Can you read this code? No. No. The devil can't hear you because he he fight you. You must read to the devil because we have God's journalist. And what does Jesus says when the devil come and attack him? He says Satan there is written ask a scraver. So we tell some former and unbelief spirit the foolish virgins. We show you the Bible that is written. Amen. Because we follow and we found God's journalists preaching in the desert. Hallelujah. Preaches in the desert. Amen. Hallelujah. In the desert because in the desert there's nothing but in nothing. There is something because you need the deep to call you because a pullpit pull you out of your pit. What is the pit? Unbelief. You are in the pit. Baptist Church mind is changed. When you see him, you see God. Face to face. Face to face. Face to face. Face to face. I hear the devil outside. I hear the the police virgins. They tell me now. Do you hear? Do you hear? Yes. You on on on on the on the broadcast. They make him go. They make him go. That's why I'm not in that convention because they worship a man. When Raldinho flesh Raldinho was playing for for Barcelona, the player of Brazil was playing the ball and when he plays the people worship him and they made him go. He was God to the world and now Ronaldo Lionel Messi is God for the world. What about this church? What about the supernatural? Who healed you? Who healed you? God. Who saved you? God. Who answer your prayer? Wow. Heat. Satan. Listen here. Listen here. Listen here. Listen here. Church, I hear the police virgins. They said this church make too much noise. That's why I never Amen. Hallelujah. I never joined this church. You can't join this church. You never join this church. Chosen people. Chosen Paul. Before there was a devil, before there was a song, before there was a jealous prophet, he he to worship in this church because he preached to God. God preached to God and God. What is worship? Worship is God. Sir, sir, no. No, no, brother Osco. They make too much noise. Didn't you know? Didn't you know, sister? is as I kil it near I say balm he brings a sound and I hear the dove came down the greatest gift by a sound because God hate a dead church. God hate a dead church. That's why he divorced the five foolish virgin. He divorced them because they love a dead church. Amen. My the amen. The wise virgin, he married to them. Why? Because the bapt of the Holy Ghost is the seal of God. So who married you? that border and my banister. Listen here. Can we read that? Good. So, &gt;&gt; I can't hear this. N. &gt;&gt; Huh? This is the prophet. This is your prophet outside. That's why it's only this church that accept all what the prophet brought. When you look that to this man, do you see a man? Do you see the grandfather? &gt;&gt; Do you see somebody's son? You will endure your own debt level. That's why you for more than 20 years you struggle with with a job with the money of the sickness because you see a man and a man can't help you. But God in a man behind skins the blood was only the blood was the mask of the bottom of the Holy Ghost. So the blood covers the greatest gift. Now the flesh covers the wrapping covers. But when you see his flesh because job says in my flesh I I only know I I didn't know only my redeemer but job said in my flesh I shall because God is the oil. God is the Holy Ghost. Amen. Hallelujah. The Amen. I love Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament. &gt;&gt; What is God's witness now? Witness now for this age, for your age, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So Jehovah is the Holy Ghost. So who's the token bearer? The token bearer is Jehovah, the fivestar general. Remember he preached it in bloom fontain. So bloom fontain bloom where you planted. He planned us he us amen corner. No, let's start with and is &gt;&gt; brea huh? Hallelujah. That's why he answered the questions. &gt;&gt; Did he preach questions and answer Can we give you the second code here? The greatest drawing and so he's drawing he's drawing the flesh didn't come with that power. We are weak mind battles. But he draw men for &gt;&gt; to serve him. So the man draws you not you draw the man. Don't make the man your charming. Okay. And &gt;&gt; empower Can the church say amen this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is there a witness? The devil fight you before there is convention. You have many challenges. Your car. Amen. Hallelujah. Money, your work. Amen. But greater than your problems. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Draws you.

Because the greatest hallelujah power, the bum of the Holy Ghost, the greatest gift, the angel bring you to this church. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So in other words, so in other words, how can you tell this greatest &gt;&gt; drawing power magnet that you give people money &gt;&gt; to come to church. &gt;&gt; Is it what the prophet says? &gt;&gt; This boy will preach exactly. Hallelujah. So he will stick. Hallelujah. He will stick with that prophet. And that prophet says, \"Hallelujah.\" Amen. Hallelujah. You need the greatest drawing power to bring the people to the house of the Lord. And for all this years, the baptism of the Holy Ghost bring you from Cape Town. Amen.

Hallelujah. This greatest gift. Why? Because this greatest gift didn't know then. Amen. Hallelujah. didn't know them. Why? Because the foolish virgins when this angel go around this world and give out the greatest gift, hallelujah, they reject him. Hallelujah. They reject him. How do you know, brother Rosco? Go to the churches around the world. Then you see the people sleep. There's no young people there. There's no joy. There's no speaking in tonesues. Amen. Hallelujah. There's no speaking in tonesues.

What is this? Is the power that draws to the convention. Surely he didn't know the foolish church, but he know the wise virgins. Why? Hallelujah. Because your eyes were every spot. God didn't trust you and me. God trust himself. And because when God see you, he didn't see you. Hallelujah. Himself. Because I know the Holy Ghost in you is God in you. And if you have the Holy Ghost, automatically you have the fruits of the Holy Ghost, the garment, God's pyramid, himself, God's house, God dwelling place after skin. Nothing can stop you. Without you is not God. That's why he could hate you. Amen. beyond the cherubams. The cherubams can't worship like this church. I see last night even the chorus leader is out. They say they can't go on because this ladies worship your out man. This lady is very dangerous. She can worship man. Lucifer, can you hear this church worship? Why? Why? Why?

Why? Because brother Brandham said, he said, \"You wish Brenham tabernacle was a beehive.\" But this church &gt;&gt; is a beehive. Why? Because the honey is here. Where do you find honey in the land? Moses no joy, stress, scorps here, but promised land. That's why he preached the joy of the land. The joy of the land. Why? Because once you receive the wine, the grapes, because the land is the Holy Ghost, the land is the man. Play and Moses egg and yellow. The land is the man. And many of them pry and say brother Rosco please aposttor we go around the world we can't find this please anoint me I want to take to my church. You're a praise. You're a Jesus.

You know when you start the convention and it looks So long, but before you know it's over, that's just the way time is. Time is not counted by milestones. Time is counted by split seconds. In the moment, in the twinkling of an eye, that's when time gets counted. And before we know, the time has slipped into history. These meetings we're going to sit in again when we get to the other side. &gt;&gt; God is going to switch on his tape recorders. And I'm sure as I stand here, as we walk into that conference after the rapture, each one of you will see your face &gt;&gt; as you walk in. He's the one that takes the photos. An angel of God was with us over this weekend and he took your photo. I just hope that you were in your point of duty where he placed you. And I'm sure you were there and a perfect picture was taken. And that picture has got no faults in &gt;&gt; that picture don't have your old history. It's only your good things that's going to be in that &gt;&gt; photo. So when we think about a thing like that then we going to hear him say you didn't come to the convention. View yourself something in here. &gt;&gt; Accepted an invitation from him. He invited you and he says where two or three are gathered there'll be in your midst and you accepted the invitation. You are here by invitation and you're going to be there by invitation. So we we just come to say as the family, thank you for the weekend of fellowship. Thank you for the weekend spent with him. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the weekend. musicians. David was very glad this weekend when he looked at you and he says, \"Surely I didn't write Psalm 150 for nothing.\" Elizabeth Aome. We thank all the ministers, elders, deacons. We used to in the old days used to sing that song. We together again. Surely we were together again. We do not know what's going to take place next year. And um just want to say this before New Year's Day. They call 2025 the year of the courts trials and a year of nation turn against nation. It was a year of indictment and in spiritual it was the year where he said I know you're not to the other group. We um we had tried to preach the message and it's not finished. The greatest message ever preached. We do not know why God gave us that message about 25 years ago or more. Brother Sunonny Bernades said, \"I would like to see you, brother Rosco.\" So I step aside. I said, um, what would you like to tell me, brother Sunny? He says, \"No, I just want to tell you this about 25, 30 years ago.\" He says, \"You know what you done?\" I says, \"What?\" He says, \"You took the best part of the message to yourself. And I asked him, I said, \"Uh, what is the best part?\" He said, \"That dove that's flying with you.\" &gt;&gt; And little did I know then that that was the greatest thing. in heaven, in the Bible, in the spoken word, in the worship, in my prayer, in my singing, in my dancing, because the Holy Ghost is everything. And little did I know I'll have people that feels the same way I feel. And little did I know I'm going to meet some people that don't only is message believers but oil receivers. It was worth it all. All the fights I had to go through, &gt;&gt; but they couldn't get me away from the oil. Therefore, at the late hour like this, he could give us a message like that. I'm so glad that I didn't follow like somebody said. If you have a man that feed your garbage, if you have a pastor that feeds your garbage, then you just hired yourself. You just got yourself a hired killer, a serial killer. Cuz a pastor that don't have the dynamics and mechanics is a serial killer. He kills the whole church. Don't kill his soul only and his family's soul. He kills the whole church. And I'm going to jump my gun from the part two. The greatest word in Matthew 25, the seventh seal. Is this the thing that separated them? Is this give us of your oil? No, we can't. No. Separate them because God says no before he says yes. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not eat of the tree. No. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt no murder. Thou shalt know commit adultery. Thou shalt know 10 nos before he says yes. So what separated them? &gt;&gt; I don't hear you. That's why if anybody want to get you away from El Tabernacle, what must you say? I just want to conclude. Brother Brandham says God couldn't trust his own son without the Holy Ghost. And Jude just turned it around for me. Says, \"God, brother, uh, Dad, when you turn it around, that means God couldn't trust the word, the Bible, &gt;&gt; without the Holy Ghost. So that shows you that the Holy Ghost is greater. I don't hear you. Have you got the greatest thing? And then The message love Corinthians 13. They compromise and they call it Corinthians 13. They call it love. They love everybody. I'm dumping some of my friends because of the friends they have. Cuz their friends cannot be my friend. Why? &gt;&gt; Because that word became real to me. No, &gt;&gt; I'm going to lay down with the next and they like this love story, but I just like to read Corinthians 13 verse 13. and our abided faith, hope and charity. These three now he comes. But the greatest of these is And brother Abraham asked God, he says, u when the angel stood in front of him, he says, \"What is perfect love?\" And the angel says, \"You didn't preach it all the time.\" He says, \"What's it?\" He says, \"The baptism of the Holy Ghost. Then I just want to turn the thing a little bit. Now abideth faith, hope, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And the greatest of them all is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I have become as a sounding bride or tinkling symbol a foolish virgin. And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all the mysteries and all the knowledge, and though I have all faith, seven thunder faith, so that I could remove mountains and have not the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it profit me nothing. The Holy Ghost sufferth long virtue. The Holy Ghost is kind brotherly kindness. The Holy Ghost don't envy. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost don't vaunt itself, don't puff up virtues. So where does the virtues come from? Does the Bible say so? Galatians 5 says the fruit of the spirit is love. Love is only a fruit of Corinthians 13. The baptism of the Holy Ghost. The baptism of the Holy Ghost do not behave itself unseemingly. It doesn't seek its own. &gt;&gt; It's not easily provoked. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; it thinks no evil. Amen. &gt;&gt; It rejoiceth not in iniquity. &gt;&gt; When somebody sins and he falls with four women, it doesn't compromise. It says no, you can't do it. But the baptism of the Holy Ghost, charity, rejoice in the truth. &gt;&gt; Why is there rejoicing here in El Tabernacle? Why is there rejoicing in El Tabernacle? &gt;&gt; The truth is preached. It bears all things. It believes all things. It hopes all things and endure at all things. The baptism of the Holy Ghost never fails. It started without an end &gt;&gt; and it's still here today after 1979 and it will never end. We know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part shall be done away with. When I was a child, a foolish virgin, I spake as a child. I understood as a child. I thought as a child. But when I become a man, &gt;&gt; I put childish things away. Receiving the Holy Ghost without emotional. I put it away. &gt;&gt; For the greatest of them all is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Greatest thing in heaven. And that's why I think Romans 5:5 says the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by so you can't have love. You ministers in the message, you can't have love unless the Holy Ghost put it in there. So as you go on your way, go tell this over the mountains, over the hills, and everywhere that Jesus Christ is born in hearts. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Jesus. As you go to your respective homes, may the angel of God go with you, gave you safe, traveling mercies. And may God help us to meet again. I know I'm going to see a lot of views maybe April month in Durban, but surely we'll see one another for the next convention. And then I want to see if you told somebody across the mountains, &gt;&gt; over the valleys, &gt;&gt; on the hilltops that Jesus Christ is in Eel Tabernacle. As a Rosco family, we greet you shalom. As a choir sings, go and tell it on the mountain. I wonder if you can just turn around, give one another hug. That will last maybe for one year. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Over the hills and everywhere. Tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born. While shephers kept their watching or silent flocks by night, behold throughout the heaven there shone a holy Sh where upon the earth. &gt;&gt; I hope I see you next year again. Even if you don't have money, we'll make a plan for you to be here. &gt;&gt; God bless you. music everywhere. Tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born. Don't you love and appreciate our apostle? Oh, let's put our hands together. Down in a lonely manger, our humble bride was born and brought us all salvation. That blessed Christmas morning. Go and tell it &gt;&gt; on the mountain. over the hills and every itus is on the mountain. of singus. Oh, &gt;&gt; let me see you. Put your hands together. Oh, I cannot see you.

As Lord Clive comes forward just to close the Lord's service, Clive Precious Elder, can we all just bow our heads as we close our eyes? Let us pray. Kind one, lovely one. Father, we heard the blessing from the man of God as he send us in our different directions. And Lord, we will ride on that. Oh God, we thank you for this time. We thank you for this weekend, Lord. And we are riding on the blessing of the apostle as we go in our different separate directions in the name of Jesus, King God. Amen. And amen. May we see that as the deacons comes forward. Amen. We just have a few announcements. First of all, the there's a lot of items that's been found that people has lost. It's cell phones and charges, there's irons, there's clothing, there's extension cords. All these items, if you have lost them, it's in the coffee shop. You can get it from the deacons. Amen. And we would like to show you the baptism candidates. And I can tell you this that nowhere nowhere in this message world do they baptize at a convention. Amen. Amen. We have a courtship to announce brother Larato from Port Elizabeth, brother Laru and sister Koutlano Male from Johannesburg. Amen. Hallelujah. If you can just Amen. So uh Hallelujah. Amen.

A New Year's Eve service will start at half 7 this on Wednesday. Then there's a request for the brothers, not the sisters, the brothers to remain seated after the service because we want you to help us with the mattresses in the classrooms here. So the brothers, if you can remain seated to help us with these Amen. with these addresses and then we also request all the believers that has to be taken to the park station today you can also remain seated if we can get you in that corner please and then we also want all the ministers just to remain seated. We just would like to play you a recap, a recap video of the convention, what has transpired over the weekend. Just remain seated. Amen. Oh, tell it on a mountain. This is the only time that our tabernacle is not drawn, oh my &gt;&gt; to a Christmas tree, but they chased to the tree of life. Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills. And I say I say everywhere One day, one day you will recognize that God is in you that it will be caught with God. Let me not fall into the hands of men. Let me fall into the hands of God. You tried many times to come out of that temptation. You tried many times to come out of that strike. Prayer after prayer, this after that. But one day you walk into an atmosphere. You didn't have to think. You didn't have to do anything. Your fingers went to the right places. Hallelujah. He saw people that can be delivered. He saw free people. He saw people hallelujah. Praise the Lord. That wants to go home. And my brother, I'm not looking to Pharaoh's window this morning, but I'm looking to the window of Moses. I'm looking to the window of an apostle that said doesn't look to your mistakes. Don't look to your problems. You are God, children of the most high God. Don't look to nothing else. I'm looking to his window this morning. You are God's sons and daughters of the most high God. And that settles it. is so great and so powerful that not even God in the flesh when he was here could preach it. said, \"The comforter didn't come yet, so I can't give you the comforter, but there's some coming with the greatest message ever preached. Cuz the greatest pullpit had the greatest man that have the greatest gift, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he give out to the people the greatest. What is this? The greatest. I feel it in my feet and I feel it in my hands. I feel it aloud. This must be the bapt of the Holy Ghost.

given us we can come together as brothers to enjoy you father we thank you for this Memorial occasion we thank you for your Apostle that's guiding and leading us we surely say we have true leadership in our church [Applause] [Music] princess the Lord in let me give you all the glory of Lord and we won't forget to give you the praise the honor and the glory for great things that was done may your bless us father in Jesus name amen amen you can just greet one another [Music] [Music] amen you may be seated we thank God for these two weekends that we've had with the mothers in the daughters and by coincidence the trusses wanted this weekend for the fathers and the sons and the fathers and the sons has been here did you just have a good time [Applause] it's so ironic that tomorrow's Father's Day and the fathers could be with their little ones enjoying things around God Amen what we would like to sow to you to this morning is the two core building blocks of what we believe and what we believe is what you should know and what you should teach your son what else what else Tabernacle in the message of the hour is all about and to say how to put it into the world and what I'm going to sow to you from God's apostle you'll be able to get the pamphlet of it and you'll go through it so that you can relate to it be able to tell your child about it and when your child faces the world and they know what to answer on what we believe and you might say I have a clue what it is but it's good to put it in the world and know what is our belief system everybody has a belief system out there and when you approach them they give it to you this is it and they give you the scriptures and this is what we want to do and the first thing that we'll start off with is the life story of a prophet William Mary and Brenham and you need to know everything about him because you're in the message of the hour and the name of his father was if somebody must ask you what was his father's name you can turn around and say his father's name was Charles Branham because you're in the the message of the hour you ought to know who brother Brian's father was amen who knew that or didn't know that amen it's quite a lot of new people in the church and we need to give you this so that you can go through it so that you can know how to answer amen and the name of his mother does anybody know that if you don't know put up your hand see a lot of yous don't know amen mother's name was Ella Branham the place of birth was Boxville Kentucky in the United States in bucks for Kentucky in the United States I don't know about the Doma knew that but that's actually where he was born amen amen the Apostle we we need to have the answer because we believe that God sent a messenger in this hour amen he was born in a log cabin and his grandmother was the midwife you didn't know that so this is the core things of what God did through the man that he sent amen his grandmother was the middle wife when he was born his mother says The Light Came whirling in and hung over his bed and when his father opened and his father opened the door to the cabin so there was something Supernatural at his birth and he was born in a lock cabin a wooden cabin amen so that was how the prophet of God arrived and that's where he was born then the question comes in when somebody asks you why a prophet why a prophet why do you say why a prophet the scripture goes on and you will have it on the spam flute I don't know if you have it already it says here be all out saying to Elijah the prophet he doesn't say I'll send you Elijah but he'll send you Elijah the prophet that's why it's a prophet because the Bible says I'll send you Elijah and he'll be a prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord so just before that Dreadful day of the Lord that's why we believe he's a prophet he wants to say program is a prophet the Bible says you'll be a prophet and that's why we need to know this and that's why you need to teach your child and tell everybody that's why God sent a prophet and he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse Revelation stands seven why a prophet and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets that's why we say it's a prophet because he will Revelation stances he will reveal it to his servant and that's why we say this was our Prophet do you believe he was our prophet but on here we are told in Amos 3 7 surely the Lord will do nothing God will do nothing but revealeth his secret to his servants the prophets so in this hour God would have done nothing unless he sent us Malachi 4 that's why we say Prophet because he will do nothing unless he reveals it to his servants the prophet as he revealed it God promised that before he destroys the Earth he will send Elijah the prophet as per Malachi form so before he destroys the world he'll send an answer before he destroys it thus Prophet will be the seventh church as Messenger to the leotician church age he was sent to reveal the misery of God then seven Revelations tell you and it says here in Amos 3 7 God cannot do anything without revealing his secrets to his prophet so when you're out there you're the university wherever this is why we say prophet that's why we believe in the message of the hour because it's Bible amen as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the end time when the son of man shall be revealed that's what Jesus is it will be the same and if this is the days of Noah it is exactly what has taken place and that's what we need to know as young people as new converts as old people and to let our sons and our daughters be indoctrinated with what our core doctrines and why we say that amen in Matthew 17 10 down to 13 the disciples acquired of Elijah should still come Jesus affirmed that he has already come a lot of people believe he's still coming but we can surely say he has already come and they knew him not but surely he will come again to restore all things but the brother by Jesus is they knew they didn't know the first that Elijah John and he will surely come again and if I didn't know that one they will know this one and he will restore all things and we know that the spirit of the Prophet Elijah manifested five times according to the scripture so it manifests that five times that's why it's a prophet because God manifested it five times Elijah the prophet who could shut heavens and it reigned not open it again so it could rain Elisha who received the double portion of Elisha's spirit John the Baptist the third Elijah one that came and they knew him not as Jesus responds to his disciples then Elijah I mean William Branham one that Jesus referred to must restore all things before the Dreadful day of the Lord did this happen do you know why he came because it was said he is going to do these things so God's supposedly showing us we are in the word of God and we ought to know these things as preachers we ought to know we don't just say the prophet said it was in the Bible to say that these things will happen and it has already happened but we need to let our children and these young converts know why we say these things thank you and we got to tell our children our sons and our daughters this is why we come to El Tabernacle it's not just because we believe it's why we believe this because God said so then Elijah will return with Moses to preach to Israel during the tribulation period we should let them know the Elijah will come back after we go he'll be back here so Elijah will come how many times sorry okay so you still what what what we are trying to say here to you today he will come five times God said no Prophet to reveal the miseries of God call out a bride from the church as it happened God's Prophet is God's mouthpiece and as it was in the days of Noah this Prophet was sent to warn people before the oncoming judgment warning before judgment that's why it's a prophet and we need to know why a prophet amen let's give the Lord another hand amen do you love your son and does the son love the father and if you do make sure they know why they are and this is what we're trying to show why we believe things amen then the next thing that we want to lay down for you people this morning it's the life story of the Lord Jesus Christ do you know this man Jesus king God I don't know do you know do you know him if you're in El Tabernacle you ought to know him and you ought to know his life story and why and who he is and we also need to know the date of birth when he was born so when the they come and they ask you when was Jesus born you need it to know when he was born when was he born amen amen we agree we agree with you young men in a way to agree but why we have this is to show those young men when he was born and God has got leadership to tell us in this setting that each one must be on the same page to know in the Bible why he was born and when he was born Jesus was the Lamb of God and he was born in Bethlehem did you know he was born in Bethlehem Lambs were born between late March and mid-april so he was born between late March and the beginning of end of April according to the word of God can you say Amen to them [Applause] he was the son of God Joseph assumed fatherly duties being espoused to Mary so Joseph was not his father he took on fatherly duties but the Holy Ghost was his father amen thank you so if you are faced with this question or your son Faith you can teach him this is what we believe based on the word of God amen the name of his mother was Mary and she found favor in the sight of God and was given was a virgin when she was found with child of the Holy Ghost In accordance to the scripture Isaiah 7 14. and he says Behold a virgin shall conceive bear a son and shall be called his name Emmanuel he was born and of the Holy Ghost she was a virgin and Joseph just took on the fatherly duties because he was espoused but his father was amen the place of birth was bethelium of Judea about 10 kilometers from Jerusalem he was born in a manger because there was no place for Mary and Joseph at the Inn measures are normally found in a stable which is perfect manges I am normally in a stable befitting a lamb and the Lamb of God foreign and when he was born there was also a light a star appeared amen then the question comes from why Jesus why not Muhammad why not anything else the Bible says yo Matthew 1 23 says his name Shall be Called Emmanuel which being interpreted God that's why we need him because he is with us the Emmanuel why Jesus [Applause] he was God in flesh in order to redeem his children God came down himself and was manifested in flesh that's why we needed him God himself was manifested in thank you that's why Jesus can you say it after me God himself was manifested in flesh but why was he manifested in flesh why why to redeem us are you redeemed that proves that God was in are you redeemed that proves that God was in why Jesus the Redemptive work God became flesh he took on our sins where no one was found worthy and died on the cross he became sin so that we can become the righteousness of God second Corinthians 5 11 who has no sin but who took our sins away that's why we need Jesus thank you First Corinthians 15 3 2 verse forces for I have delivered unto you first of all which I have received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and he was buried and he rose again the third day according to the so the scripture said he will die and Rise Again and it happened just like that that's why is Jesus King God why Jesus why Jesus because it's Bible and it's fulfilled Acts 2 36 says therefore let all the house of Israel Noah surely that God has made that same Jesus whom we have crucified both Lord and Christ that's saying Jesus whom you have crucified is both Lord and Christ there they have the revelation of the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost but the scripture says the son is both Lord and Christ so in other words the name shows that he was God in flesh he was Jesus Christ he's Lord and that's why we believe in Jesus that's why we say Jesus king why is he King God because God made him both Lord and he is the Emmanuel which means Philippians 2 10 and 11 says that by the name of Jesus every knee by the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is now do we shout Jesus king God because he is Lord [Applause] can you say Amen [Music] [Applause] Revelations 5 John wept because no man was found worthy to open the book of redemption and no one and but one of the elders told him not to weep because the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book but when he looked he saw a lamb as it has been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into the Earth that's why it is Jesus that's why it is King and that's why he is Lord when you look at him when John saw him he had seven eyes seven horns seven spirits of God manifested as why he is Lord amen in this day the Lord himself shall descend in this day because he is Lord he shall descend with a shout with a voice and with a trumpet The Messengers were the lamb before the foundation of the world when he was slain the seven eyes the seven spirits of God sent into the Earth The Messengers have they come were they here so why Jesus it's God in flesh as the musicians play before the man of God come why Jesus according to what the Apostle wants his son to understand he was born of a Virgin Mary and Joseph the assumed the parental duties but this was conceived of the Holy Ghost where was he born in Bethlehem because the Bible says he will come out of so that's why we say we don't say he is Lord or that because the word of God says he'll be those things and he is Emmanuel God worth us so does do you understand young man do you know now when was Jesus born between March and April because that's the time when Lambs are born [Music] let us stand to our feet keep this for reference until you know I'll go why we say do you appreciate the man of God because we ask him to come and address US Grace for us this morning amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Applause] all right now oh my thank you you made me see that amen I was not supposed to be yeah I started recuperating and I just forced myself to to be here and that's why I'm here I try to save myself for the combined and uh I want to be really over this thing I think is about three or four years ago when I was struck with covet in bloemfontein is exactly the same time he came and visit me again and then I had quite a fight to get over it and um but I feel much better I have two weeks to go to a combined so um I need to try and get as much rest as I can so um I'm so happy for um these meetings that we had special house wake and now this week to give you the doctrine I'm a noun you heard such a lot from outside that we don't believe in a prophet and we don't even mention his name and we don't I think we even quote the prophet more than anybody else but we also realize that the young people is not indoctrinated with a doctrine that we believe in and we failed to sow it back and so that you can say it over and over and over again to your family imagine the Jews there's some core values that they are sowing back every day for more than five thousand years the same thing those children hear it every time now if you watch How I pulled it up I brought out what we believe is first before Jesus you know and just to clear the thing up people might think how could you put brother Branham in front of Jesus and I'd done that purposely because nobody will ever know Jesus unless you know brother Brennan and um that's why we wanted to lay down the whole history of the man that showed us Jesus now we are word oriented Church and now automatically you ask the question why and where is the word for that the word for that is in Matthew 3. where John the Baptist which is Elijah said behold the lamb nobody knew the land nobody knew Jesus but Elijah did and he pointed out Jesus [Applause] so none of us here know Jesus and you would have never known Jesus if God didn't send Malachi 4. [Applause] and he told us yeah let's look away to Jesus how can you look away to Jesus if you don't know him so he didn't only had to show us but he had to point him out and he pointed him out and that that makes us the only people on the Earth [Music] that knows Jesus [Applause] and that also makes us the only people that calls him Jesus can't hear you I can't hear you the only people that say that it's quite strange that he always want somebody to point him out thank you [Applause] and that's why we bring out brother branham's a life story and the man called Jesus King God that's our Doctrine [Applause] brother CJ told us that he brought a woman and a three children from polokwane to joburg in the time of Ramadan and he saw the kids about two o'clock that they were really lame and and they look as if they're gonna pass out so he pulled up at the shop he says ma'am I see your children is hungry I'll just run in and buy them something and we can go she says you don't do that and he says why she says I'm a Muslim but to buy food he says yes it's Ramadan they must know too fast they'll eat tonight when it comes to this [Applause] when it comes to this you put on your feet and you feel the difference if it's fast they have to fast they need to be indoctrinated the thing is going to be drawn into them if it's Tuesday [Applause] they need to know it's Tuesday there's no eating they need to be brainwashed in what we believe if if if the Jews and Muslims could be so strict on their belief the Muslims are so strict they even believe in lies anything that the elders told them they believe it you take for instance they're saying that Muhammad went to heaven from the Temple mount and you try to look at history Muhammad was never in Israel but they believe it because they get told that every day when you tell somebody a lie every day they're going to believe that lie and if we tell our children every day the same thing over and over and over and over and over again they will believe it so you cannot compromise on one little thing that we teach in El Tabernacle not one thing [Applause] you need to believe everything that we say yeah well if it's not Bible you don't believe it but if it's hurting yeah only ones you put your life on it believe it with everything in you and how could Jonathan even said why is it the Muhammad or somebody like that Muhammad is not a prophet he's never been a prophet there's not one time Muhammad prophesied to our young people must know who Jesus is because they claim Deuteronomy that God will raise up a prophet and they say that is Muhammad but Muhammad is a not a prophet he never prophesied anything you never said something will come to pass and it came to pass so it's not a prophet so we can't believe in it our children need to know not to believe in it I don't have to grow up not to believe in him I don't have to get so strong in their faith and say Jesus Christ is that prophet of Deuteronomy foreign ought to know that Muhammad married an old woman you wanted to taste our old woman taste and when she died he married and slept with a nine-year-old now which prophet ever slept with the baby made his wife but there's a Doctrine they believe in the Quran says that every Muslim can marry Four Women but he had ate so we need reality and we got reality because of our foundation is built on the prophet and the apostles so we can't go wrong because we know we're right amen that's why we told the sisters when that baby is born the minute that baby is born you take a or you take him he always been his ear and you whisper my child remember Jesus is King God my child remember God sent a prophet my child remember God sent the Holy Ghost in E El Tabernacle [Applause] foreign [Applause] so that goes to say brother William the first thing that God hears and that boy or girl years when they enter into this realm is God first thing the ear here now why why the ear because the ear is the first organ that develops while at babies in the stomach she already knows her mother's voice and then when Mom talk into the ear there that is already developed long ago and it catches the the the words from Mom and the words is another dimension God how can a child go wrong and the last thing that shuts off they say the last thing that shuts off when you die is your ear because when somebody is in a coma and you speak they can hear you although they're in a coma because the ear is active so that's the reason it's a must for you to talk into their ear oh and therefore brethren it's good to repeat things I got one problem I preach never the same thing but a good preach is a preacher that repeats things because God keeps on repeating remember remember he'll tell you he repeats himself all the time because we have to forget and we need to remind our children around the table at suppertime remind them about the doctrine remind them about King Jesus remind them about the miracle that has happened to you and then when you finish you bless your wife and you'll bless your children because that's what we don't do we have to do it every time God bless my wife God bless my children brethren this weekend might seem simple but God is hidden in simplicity you know it's such a good thing once in a while just to break away from a wife and children to be a little alone with him like this weekend [Applause] you ought to have a time of your life because you went away from the hustle and the bustle of brethren to be with him who loves your soul so very much [Applause] he has overcome everything he cried victory over everything [Music] he walked over every evil spirit and you know what as I'm closing he could have called Ten Thousand Angels that Saturday the Saturday [Applause] oh I'm sure that wormwood wanted to come with him I'm sure Gabriel was already I'm sure you real was ready I'm very very very very very sure that Raphael was ready to go with him I'm sure 10 000 Legions of angels was ready to join him [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but you know what [Applause] he remembered his own words in Matthew 24. he says hell was made for the devil and his angels it wasn't made for Heavenly angels and it wasn't made for you and then he said I'm not going to go down there with my bride my bride hell is not made for you he says I'll go down this Saturday alone a one-man invasion [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it just shows you if anybody goes to hell he goes alone you won't have the brothers with him the rich and ruler said can you just won my brethren not to come to this place he was alone hell is a lonely place [Music] you go there alone [Music] but the funniest part of it all funniest part of it all heaven we go as a group for together we'll meet the Lord in the air and so shall we be with God God bless her [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh foreign [Applause] foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause]

This special message will include a deep exposition of how these events align with biblical prophecy\u2014fulfilling what the Apostle previously declared: \"In The Next 6 Months, Something  Is going To Crack...\"\nTRANSCRIPT\n========================================\n[Music] But you can't lie to me with all those spoken words. You don't [Music] live. I'm not trying to follow you to the end of the world. I'm just trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus in God. Words have come from men. No Bible. Oh, but I can't help thinking that I heard the wrong crowd. When the Holy Ghost is gone, my job will be true. And I'm trying to leave something behind in the foot of Jesus. All the money is free but the holy go and the s is all to me. Oh, the future ahead is broken in something behind the Jesus. This whole world is a war. We follow the world, but we don't know why. We're running the case, but we got something in the footprints of Jesus. I believe we are at the wrong time and I cannot I don't There is a peaceful escape in my bra. You can put me there when the machine is taking the soul away. for the ceiling for me. It's so hard to f Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh somewhere those who It's time to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus. Hold on my knees more [Music] than you. When my soul stands at his face [Music] statue, you will know what I was trying to leave something behind. I was trying to leave something behind. I was trying to something [Music] [Music] behind. I am uh glad that I could uh speak to especially my church eel tabernacle which God called me to be overseer look after his flock and uh I want to say like Paul saying I didn't um shun to declare all the councils of God and not only declare it but also manifest it, bring it to pass by the help and the grace of Almighty God. I would like just to pray and I didn't think it's going to be so quick that I have to put the clips out again because I'm trying to get away from it. But u major events requires major ministries to actually make sense. Like brother Brennham says in birth pains men will come behind me and make sense. And I'm glad that I could say in this late hour that I'm one of that men that has made sense to Malachi 4's prophecies and word as he has prayed over me, laid hands on me. I said, \"This boy will preach exactly what I preach, which I did.\" And he declares and put a stamp on Revelations 10:8. So, I just like to say a prayer. Father, we come to you in the name of Jesus Christ. We know all is just the grace of God. And all is inspired by an angel that we can do nothing unless it's given from above, Lord. And Lord, we so glad that we could only line up behind your prophet that you send in an hour and make sense to the word that he brought seeing that he didn't have all the time that we had. And Father, I pray that you'd again just make sense to what you showed me and this whole thing in your hand because I cannot handle it. You actually is the one that wrote it inspired through a prophet and you said men will come behind it and make sense to it. And you said Revelations 10:8 will prophesy again. And Lord, what we're going to say is already said, but because you said it needs to be said again, we fulfill the scriptures in Jesus' name. Amen. Um, I would like to just take a scripture reading. Revelation 17 verse 5. And upon her head, forehead, was a name written, mystery Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, an abomination of the earth. It's a mystery that we're going to speak upon this evening. And I would like to take verse seven. And the angel said unto me, wherefore did thou marvel, John? Why did you marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carth her, which had the seven heads and 10 horns. It's a mystery. And John marveled. He wondered. He actually couldn't grasp it. when he looked at this woman and um we would like to speak on this because everybody is silent and I cannot be silent because I can't help for who I am. If there was a newspaper, I would call it the newspaper of the new Jerusalem. The headlines of this newspaper of the new Jerusalem will actually be focused on the very hour and the time we living now. The headlines will be what I am going to talk on now nothing else because God's word comes in its season and its time and now we have come into the time zone of these scriptures to be fulfilled and we do not want our church to miss it. They must catch on not modern events made clear by prophecy but prophecy now is been cleared by modern events. So we are going into some beautiful things, scary things, marveling things that is playing right in front of us now because it's in the newspaper of the New Jerusalem Post, which is the Bible, the book of Revelations that is playing out in front front of us. So the first thing I would like to do is to play the clip that I spoke on these things that's going to happen way back in December uh 2024 where I made a statement but I feel That's right. That in the next six months, something is going to happen. For the next 6 months, hold on. Something is going to crack, but we will be walking in the light. God bless you. Now there is a mouthwatering prophecy in December 5 months ago and I must be honest I was looking at Revelations 13 as such at that specific time where the spirit showed me revelation 13 and that's why I say something is going to break and little I know something more is going to break. Now if this thing has broken the way it did I conclude this thing positively I don't know what made me say so I don't know what came over me but that's how prophecy works you know brother Raymond Thompson and them will tell you how many times did I prophesy he was there when I prophesied of sister Ba um Daniel's brother Alfie's wife that nobody thought when I prophesied it it could ever happen what she did and the Holy Ghost told me the whole thing and uh when we got to our house luckily Alfie wasn't there me and Raymond was there and I told her what the Holy Ghost told me and she went in made tea and came back and she said I just told my sister do this afternoon that um she told her that listen I not going to believe this man anymore if he doesn't know what I'm doing. He said and yet tonight you and brother Raymond came and told me what I'm doing. Raymond can tell you the story. Then he was also there when I said on a Wednesday night, let's go to a certain flat. We'll catch one of the elders there with the woman. He was there with that prophecy as well. Then he was there when I said let's go down to Clay Thorp and uh brother Fortain being the trustee and a treasurer down there that uh he is busy taking uh the tithe money and he went with me down there and it was just like that he knows of all those prophecies. I don't speak about even you know Baron whoms I'm I'm I'm telling you something that you don't know and even Solenica knows some of this prophecies that came to pass and uh that's why it makes El tabernacle an outstanding church amidst all the churches in the message because a stamp is put on here not only with the Holy Ghost and not only by preaching Not only by a gift, but prophecy has been fulfilled many a times. And here goes the prophecy out again. How many people was wondering what's going to happen? How could this guy get up right in December and say, \"Well, in the next six months, something is going to break.\" And without sherking, without quavering, without being scared, say it twice. Now, it has come to pass. We're going to go into it and uh if that has come to pass then what about the rest what I said then al tabernacle you'll know that you are walking in the light. So brethren I cannot help for the fruit that's on the tree. Yeah, I think everybody has now seen what I said my prophecy for the next 6 months and um there's people that's going around and say that I said in another 6 months Jesus is coming and especially brother Oils's family and I'm now sick and tired of brother uh Peter Majadi Buddhy um hitting us from behind all the time. I'm going to have a special meeting and I'm going to tell you what his name mean and I'm going to tell you who he is. I don't have time now to go into it but I want you El Tabernacle when you see him call him Maju. That's what you call him. And I'll tell you people that don't know what that mean. I'll tell you the meaning of it. Thank you. As they like to say, you can't change history. You know, this is history. You can't change it. It's been done and it's there. You either believe it or you don't believe it. So that's why I like to play the clip once again. But I feel that in the next six months something is going to happen [Music] for the next 6 months. Hold on. Something is going to crack, but we will be walking in the light. God bless you. And that I made out of the mouth of two witnesses. Let everything be established. That's why I said it twice. Now, Statue of a Perfect Man, page 6D. I would like to just read it for you. And I want to take it, Brother Brandham says, and study it and compare it and then act upon it. Don't just study it, compare it, but act upon it. When you do, take it sincerely to yourself. Don't say, \"Well, I enjoyed listening at it. I did, too. But to listen at it and then receiving it is different. See, it's different. Now I want to say you compare this, you take it, you compare that, you act upon it. What I said within the next 6 months, see if this is the word of God. If it isn't, then you know it's false. It needs to be chucked in the dustman and it is from the devil himself. But if it is after you took it, study it, compare it, act upon it, after you done all that and you find out that it is the truth, then you obligated to it and compare it and take it and act upon it and study it. then you compel to actually take it or otherwise you find yourself sinning. Now that is why I would like to bring in this quote out of the oddball which is 1963 the year he he preached the seals and speak about the spirit of truth. So this is truth then that's why he put it in this message the spirit of truth and it may be my going home may be my time to die in other words it looks very much that way it looks as if I'm going cuz after two years here he died if it is there will raise somebody after me that will take the message on. He'll be an odd person, but he'll rise after this after what? after brother Brandham and take the message on and you listen to it as long as as it's scripture stay with it stay after you compare it page 60 stay with it now I can't help for this quote brother Brandham says it and I believe that that odd ball is Revelations 10:8. He will come after brother Brandham, prophesy again what brother Brandham already said. And there is nobody that came after brother Brham and prophesied again and it happened. So this gets fulfilled every time. Every time. I like to take an exposition of the seven church ages with that quote. It says this age started after the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which a true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost. We know that these must of necessity be a return of dynamical power which is the Holy Ghost dynamics. The believers sensed this in their spirits and began crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century. What seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the spirit. It was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration. It was not. It wasn't. Why? For the letter rain can come only after the former rain. So the former rain has to come first. Now what's the former rain? Which is the spring or teaching rain? The teaching rain is a former rain. Then comes the letter rain. The letter rain then is the harvest rain. That's the last rain. How could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come? The teaching rain didn't come yet. Now watch what he says here. The prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach. Now who brought the teaching reign? The prophet who brought the word the teaching reign the prophet the prophet brought it and that's why I do not go in this time with brother Brandham says brother brenham says brother brenham says quote after quote trying to teach brother brenham already done it trying to prove the message it's already proven because the teaching reign has come already So we need something extra. That's why he says I don't care about the mechanics, the teaching reign, the push and play rain. That's past tense. That's gone. We're in another age. We're in another reign. Why? Because this is what he says. Why do we not have that? is because he says the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people there's your teaching reign and turn the hearts. Then after teaching the word of God the former reign he turns around he says and turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers had heath not come. So the latter rain had not come. The teaching reign came because the prophet came. But the letter rain didn't come yet. So there must be somebody that come after the prophet that will bring the letter rain. And it's been proven since 1979 right around the world who brought the letter rain. And um thus what was uh uh thought to be the restoration and the final quickening until the rapture had not come. So this final climax, the quickening power is actually preparing the people for the rapture. So here you got two direct quotes. If this didn't happen and brother Brandham was a false prophet this is two quotes that's in prophecy you know somebody will come and after the teaching reign comes the baptism of the Holy Ghost the token. Oh, I thank God that the world knows, Pentecost knows, everybody knows that this quote was fulfilled in South Africa in El Tabernacle. Now, you can stumble as much as you want to stumble. You can't prove it any other way. You can't argue fruit. You can't go against history. You can't go against a ministry that has proven to be the dynamics and mechanics together. The former and the letter rain together. The dynamics and the mechanics, the oil and the wine. Amen. Together it is in El Tabernacle and still Yeah. So I needed to bring that in for you to see what brother Brandham says. So you work it out with brother Brandham. I don't even want to speak about what he says. In every generation, uh, God sends a messenger and he's only responsible for his generation. And here I am really nearly 80 years old. I'm nearly two generations old, but he says his generation. So we two generations away from what brother Brandham has has has lived in. So somebody had to come. I wonder, didn't you miss him? Did you miss him? I am sure you did. Now, let's get into the thing. So much happened already in this six months. We're going to take two of the main events that's been in the Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem Post, which is the book of Revelation. That is our newspaper for this day and this hour. I make it the newspaper the main thing for this hour and this time that we live in. It's on the front pages of the heavenly newspapers which is the book of Revelation. So the Bible which is the word of God in Revelations 13 comes into play uh into play with the USA Revelations 13. He showed you his power of the beast just like the Bible says the power of Revelations USA. What it's got? Let's read it. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as a mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave his power and his seed and great authority gave it over to who? To Rome. Revelation 17. There is your front page of the New Jerusalem post which is the book of Revelations 13 and 17. That's on the front pages now. That is where we are living in now. So look at the power he's got. Look at the authority he's got. Now please remember this. that the power revelation 13's got. Look what he does when he came in. It's so strange that he came in within the six months. He got ordained in February month. Trump sworn in as president 20th January 2025. That's within the 6 months. I said here he comes. Revelations 13. I call him Revelations 13. Here he comes in. Now remember I said don't miss it. Brother Brand speaks about a woman come out of some America being president or the Roman Catholic Church. And I said, \"Could that be Trump from that time?\" He says, \"Or the Catholic Church.\" So here we see the sprinkling two women. A natural woman that will be voted in and a spiritual woman, which is the Roman Catholic Church, that's not voted in. She just comes in. But the natural woman that will be president, she gets voted in. So I never saw this just the other day and as I went through the quotes and all if you read really those quotes, you'll see he speaks every time of two women. That's why we have two candidates for the two women. One is Trump and the other one is Camila. One will be Cama that is voted in. So far we see how our votes went. The other one might be Trump that will let the Roman Catholic Church come in because of the pressure of the Roman Catholic Church. Because America owes her trillions of dollars. They can't even pay back the interest. So will she put the screws on Trump if he gets elected and he will give in then to her and afterwards speak as the dragon. He says or the Catholic Church to women. Then he concludes the quote by saying thus saith the Lord. So it must come to pass that was prophesied. Now let's see if it's Trump uh sworn in as president 20 January 2025 he was sworn in and the minute he came in look what he does. He goes straight to trade war. World economy is buckled. Money watch the UN this year can't move without him. If he boycott it and says I don't want to even mention Israel and all that I stand with Israel. The whole world is against Israel. He says that everybody buckles. What power is that? Is that what we read in Revelations 13:2? Is that Revelations 13? Come on, man. Amen. We are not asleep in El Tabernacle because God placed a gift here. The G20 that they had last year meeting could not come to a deal without her. They couldn't make any decisions. every time they come to something that says we'll have to wait until Trump take office and see what he's going to do. What power is that? Why must the whole world stand still because of Trump? Revelations 13. Is that the scripture that I read? Revelations 13:2. It sure is. He has the power. Then the climate change guys also had a meeting and they also couldn't go forward because they said we got to wait until we see what Trump says. Then everybody run to Revelations 13. Trump everybody. What power has this man got? Revelation 13. Now when I speak about Trump, please put Revelations 13 there. Okay, look at Macron of France running to him with the econ economic problems, the tariffs that's been put up. Um, look at Mark Kaney of Canada that ran to America to see him about the economy, money. Look at Star, the England prime minister ran to him. Look at Putin listening to him. Says, \"I will listen to him.\" Look at him now. Few days ago stopped the war between India and Pakistan power. India ran to him. Syria ran to him. Iran ran to him. Now China yesterday had talks with him. You cannot deny such power and you cannot say that he Revelations 13 hasn't already shown his muscle. It's fulfilled. Revelations 13. Why? Because the Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem Post has said so and it's now on a f on a on a on a on a on a front pages to declare it. He buckled the economy around the world by what? Terrors 25% tariffs must go up already taken place. Gold soured to 30% more this year. I would like to bring in the prophecy of brother Brandham in statue of a perfect man page 56 57 and 58 what is it now if this nation goes busted Revelations 13 go busted the only thing it can do is go busted the only thing that it can do is go busted that's the only sensible thing to do change the currency but they won't do it under this present ministration the Roman Catholic Church owns the gold of the world and what they'll do is sell out then it says it's the gold standard they gone to the gold standard and the Catholic church the hierarchy owns the gold of the world someone says6 68 billion. 168 billion. There you are. Throw it right back in the gold standard. Now, this is way back in ' 62. Now, you're going to put it about 70* 70 with that price. Then you see how many trillions you got that she has. The gold has gone up. to exceptional heights. And that shows that the prophecy prophesied by Ed Gahil Rossko December was spot on because this year the gold price has gone wild. Now, every time you near a statue of a perfect man, money fails. When Joseph came, statue of a perfect man, the Bible says, \"And money fails in the land.\" When Jesus came, money issues, the rich young ruler Judas, money was the issue. Econ economics, taxes was the problem. Here we are. Are we at the end where we have another stature of a perfect man chiseled out by the dynamics of God? The baptism in the Holy Spirit which makes a perfect man. He says, \"And the spirit takes them up into faith, virtue, knowledge, template, a perfect man.\" Oh, what a revelation. My God, I feel like preaching, man. Hey, man. They speak about virtues. They don't even know what they're talking about. Amen. When that comes in, you'll have another Joseph, a perfect man. So again, something happened. The gold price went up. Something happened. There's another perfect man on the way. Something happened. Which man in the world in this message can sit in front of me and said it never happened? It already happened. saw something cracked. Now, Revelation 13, Trump's politics against the other power. He's flicking his muscle. Leaders run to Revelations 13. Sinski, Netanyaw, Israel, they all running towards him. Revelations 13. What a thing we have. And here we have a clip of Trump and Sinski right in Rome. Right in Rome. What more can be more important than Revelation 13 has his finger in everything. Yes. Revelation 13 sitting in Revelation 17 seat man that's why I'd rather walk alone which with which minister can I walk and talk you know I saw how many times I can't afterwards I couldn't even talk to him because he didn't know he's not a pastor so God can't talk to him God speaks to the pastors first now if the pastors can't even understand me. Where can ordinary members like uh Solarenica uh uh uh understand me? They can never understand me. So here you are on the front pages of the New Jerusalem Post, Revelation 13 and Revelation 17, sitting right there. So something has happened in the 6 months. It's happening within the 6 months. Revelation 13. Trump tried to stop the Ukrainian war, tried to stop Israel and Hamas, tried to stop the Houthies, which he got it right. He stopped that war with the Houthis. Then he stopped the war on India. Now, what power is that? My brethren, if you really are spiritual, you are going to run for your life. We're going to run for your life. Okay, let's go on. Now, the mark of the beast comes out of Revelations 13:8. And let us read it. that no man might buy or sell. There you are. What is Trump doing? You can't buy without me and you can't sell without me. Now they're running because it's a buying and selling. Has this thing, this scripture being fulfilled or is it fulfilled? Right up till now, China is actually running because they want to buy and sell. But who's got the authority, the power in buying or selling? He says 25%. Even if he drops it to 10%. They still going to have to pay. He's still going to everybody. So this scripture is fulfilled. You cannot buy or sell the mark of the beast. and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of unless you come through us the beast of Revelation 13 that's going to give the power over to the real beast you know unless you have his number you can't trade I Trump which is Revelation 13 is going enforce this and this is already enforced in front of us all. Everybody speaks about it but they forgot about the scripture. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beasts. For it is the number of a man and his number is 63 score and six 666. And you don't find it in Revelation 17 which is the beast of the bottomless but Rome. You find it in America. Revelation 13 under Trump. I'm telling you, when I saw these things, I was shaking. The Holy Ghost woke me up 4:00. I mean, uh, the 4th of May, and told me, \"Go check these things out. Go back to the funeral and check the funeral out.\" And here we are. When I went through, I saw these things. I was shaking and still shaking. So, the mark of the beast right out of America. Well, now now we can understand it. You know, when I said it, nobody understood it, but now you can understand it. Why? It's because we're going to get to it, but I'm jumping the gun. The new pop pope comes out out of Revelation 13. There you are. There's the scripture. Where did brother Brandham get it? It's right in the Bible. The number of the beast of the antichrist of the pope is right in revelations 13. Where is this pope that we elected right now come from? Revelations 13. There's where brother William got it. And it's fulfilled. It's fulfilled. But somebody had to prophesy again. Who actually prophesied again? I'm the only one now that makes sense to this thing. You anti- messages um uh ministers, man, you know nothing about this. But El tabernacle, my prophecy December, we will walk in the light. God has to honor that. If he honored what I said, then he's got to honor this as well. So, we are in the light. So, El Dean, stay in the light. Don't let any other m Mickey Mouse minister try to wrap you up. This alone, just take this alone. You were sitting right in the church when I prophesied this. This alone should strengthen you so much that you close your ears to any other minister. Okay, let's go further. That number comes on Revelations 13. Who's handling the buying and the selling right now? A 2 year old can see this. A great thing has happened El tabernacle in your midst. Revelation 13 is on the march. Hardly six months. I told you there two women and I told you that Trump might represent the second woman and here we are. Okay. Revelation 13 lies the great earthquake. Everything Revelations 13 is a great earthquake. And the great earthquake contains can read the scripture when Jesus rose from the dead there was a earthquake and it was a resurrection. Now revelation 13 is holding the earthquake and Yellowstone's explosion and the a bomb from Russia. soul come into play right now. America, her doom is around the corner. I'm so glad I'm not an American. I come from God and I'm going back to God again. God hates her. She's going to pay for all the things she's done. Um, is is this the time and the season for Revelations 13? Yes, it happened before our eyes. Now, as if that's too much for our minds to absorb, this thing comes like a bullet through our spiritual brains. It hit me on Monday morning the 4th May as I said the Pope's death first of all just if the Pope had to die that alone is a major thing a major thing happened the Pope died without Trump now I'm on the second point of what cracked. That's why I said who can argue? Who can argue against fruit? Now this church, this ministry here in EL tabernacle is not an ordinary ministry. Like brother B says it's all together ministry. Brother Bram says, prophecy, dynamics, mechanics, former rain, letter rain, prophesying, all that is included. Raising the dead by the spirit, God's grace. Amen. The healing that went on, all these things, it's right in one ministry. You don't find this in any other ministry. So, what is this? Is that what God made brother Brandham come to South Africa and lay hands on the head? Whether you like it or not, it's proven. It's fulfilled. It's finished. So, Revelations 13 lies the great earthquake and everything that needs to happen. That's on the front pages now. The season is here. So, anytime anything can happen. Um but it boggles our imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imagination that here the pope dies just the dying of the pope it it it was so ironic I look at jet vans revelation 13 I look at that the day before the pope died vans went to team. Jack Vans, vice president of Revelation 13. Seeing Revelation 17, there's the two scriptures together. Still tell me that this is not the New Jerusalem's post front page. There's it. What does does this guy want there? Go see the Pope. And look how nice the pope look. Something cracked, my friends. Something happened. Happened already. Still going. It happened already. The two scriptures is running together. You never thought to bring the two scriptures together, but the Holy Ghost showed me is that two scripture, Revelation 13, Revelation 17, Trump and the Pope. There you have it. What more do you want, El Tabernacle? What more do you want? You're not going to get anything better than this. I am going to be 80 years old and a sherk no more. I say the thing because it's the truth. I can prove it black and white that this is something else. Psalm there you have this day the scriptures is fulfilled. Okay, with this we want to bring in another clip of Trump when they ask him what do you like to be the pope and just look at this. Oh my, it is mindboggling. As the Vatican prepares to host the conclave to elect a new pontiff, Donald Trump has posted an AI generated image of himself as the pope on his social media platform, which the White House then shared on its official exac account. Catholics around the world say it's deeply insulting and makes a mockery of their faith. in white paper robes seated in an ornate chair. Donald Trump posted this fake image AI generated. It was then shared on the official White House account. Earlier this week, the US president joked he'd like to be the next pope. I'd like to be Pope. That would be my number one choice. Now look at that, my friends. This looks like a joke. But yet many a true word was said in a joke. Here Revelation 13 is acting like Revelation 17. Come on. Come on. There you are. Come on. Two things I'm showing you here that already happen in front of our eyes and nobody's saying anything. Ministers, ministers, man, this makes you so jealous because you don't get anything that could prove to be near what we getting here in El Tabernacle. Whether you like it or not, I'm saying it because I'm in the the the springtime, not my springtime, the latter time of my years, and I have to say who I am. Paul says, \"Man, I magnify my office.\" So I magnify my office by proving you things. Let us look at that Revelation 13. In Revelation 17 again just and and and this this happened really it happened after this. This is before choosing the pope. As the Vatican prepares to host the conclave to elect a new pontiff, Donald Trump has posted an AI generated image of himself as the pope on his social media platform, which the White House then shared on its official ex account. Catholics around the world say it's deeply insulting and makes a mockery of their faith. In white papal robe, seated in an ornate chair, Donald Trump posted this fake image AI generated. It was then shared on the official White House account. Earlier this week, the US president joked he'd like to be the next pope. I'd like to be pope. That would be my number one choice. That's his number one choice. Revelation 13 tell you his number one choice is Revelation 17. Now, you never heard the lingo like this. You never heard like this, brother. Sorry. They never heard this. You never heard it. Nobody ever heard it. This was a joke. And yet it came to pass before it happened. He already showed you that America is going to receive a pope. And it will be a Trump and a pope both out of America. Man, I tell you, I couldn't sleep when I saw it. I don't know what you guys are going to do. That's your business. But my business is the Holy Ghost shows me the things. I cannot shun to declare the councils of God. That joke came to pass as being the truth. Now this all happened in the six months. Revelation 17. Now, Revelation 17 has that Jubilee year. This year, in the six months, this pope opened the Jubilee doors. This is the Jubilee year. So, the past year or so, the city of Rome has been cleaning all its monuments, all its fountains, getting ready for the Jubilee year. This year, 2025 rather, the year that's coming is uh called a Jubilee year for the Catholic Church. every 25 years that happens. And so, of course, they're expecting a huge influx of people into Rome, uh, to specifically to go to St. Peter's and to walk through the Holy Door, which is open once every 25 years. So, everything is nice and and spam, but of course, there going to be a lot of crowds this year coming up. So, here we are, Pantheon. Nice to be back in Rome. The weather's not great, but uh, at least it's not raining. Now, behind me is the holy door of St. Peter's Basilica. It's quite exciting to be here because normally this is cemented shut, but it's been prepared for Pope Francis to open it to begin the Jubilee year. Now, this event only takes place every 25 years. The opening of the door symbolizes God's mercy. And pilgrims who walk through the door and carry out certain acts of spirituality and charity receive forgiveness for their sins known as an indulgence. There you are right in the jubilee. Here we have a new pope. Last year was God's jubilee year. This year is the devil's jub jubilee year. Last year you got voted in a new president in Revelation 13. This year you have the Jubilee year, Satan's Jubilee year, and you have a pope voted in. Come on, how could it be? Last year, you could go free if you wanted. This year, the Roman Catholic Church says, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" Where are we standing? How are we ever going to escape if you didn't sit like brother Brandham says study and show this these things and you sit in a church where God left long ago. God left long ago but you still sit there. There's no signs. There's no wonders. There's no preaching. There's no Holy Ghost. There's no anointing. There is no signs. There's no wonders. There's no prophesying. Get to a church where brother Brham says thrive under the supernatural. Okay. Yeah. For now, the reason of the visit is not published. We don't know why Vans actually visited. Maybe somebody knows, but I don't know. But I just know that it's in the 6 months that I prophesied. Watchmen. Watchmen. Watchmen. What about the night? What about the night? Watchmen. Huh? What about the night? What do you mean the night? How many days did they wait for the election of the pope? How many days? Nine days. What happened with the ninth plague? Darkness. What happened with the pope going to Israel? Darkness. Total darkness. That's where your nine days come for. What is nine days? Nine days is to bring forth a woman bring forth after 9 days. So after nine days, what did they bring forth a prison a pope right out of America? Are we sleeping? One thing our tabernacle, we are walking in the light. El Tabernacle and wherever you are and you listen to me here right now, you ought to shout your house roofs off because you were in a meeting when this happened before it happened. Can a man do and say things that will happen and it happened every time. It happens every time. No, there has never been a thing like this in this message. Six months. Watchmen. Watchmen. What about the night? Now I want to go to the day after the visit of Vans. The pope died. Was it time to hand over to the new pope that's coming? Now don't miss this. You have Revelation 13 America and now you have a pope out of America. Both now comes out of America. Is William Brham a prophet? You're not going to tell me he isn't. My eyes is watching the word and I'm watching the New Jerusalem Post front page Revelations 13 and Revelation 17 is being fulfilled to the tea. So, Revelation 13 and Revelation 17 right now is getting ready to dance together because both comes out of America. They're going to dance together. That's why I read Revelation 13:3. All the world wonders after Revelation 17. Even Revelation 13 went to go wonder after Revelation 17. 200,000 people look how they wonder after the beast. There has never been a number like that. Now, how couldn't this behave? Look at that. Look at [Music] that. Look at that. [Music] [Music] And you [Music] are Even the Muslims was wondering after the [Music] pope. There's Revelation 13. Right. In Revelation 17, 130 states 130. Sinski. [Music] Whatever [Music] color William It's not. So in so came this day the scripture is fulfilled. So in out tabernacle. God loves you as a UN and everybody there everybody there. So it's so ironic 130 has a 13 in it. Can you imagine? And then there was 133 cardinals that voted him in. There's another 13 in it. Then his name, the new pope's name, Robert Prios. 13 letters in his name. Everything. 13 1313. Are you sleeping at Garasco? No, I'm wide awake. The next pope will come out of America and his numbers will be 13. Did brother Brennham says his surname is seven. So count the numbers in his name 13 found in Revelations 13. Now please if this is not God then tell me who is this? I don't say anything. I just get led by the spirit. And if you're spiritual, you'll know who I am. 13 13. The whole thing is just 13s. So I can't but help to see these things playing out in front of me. and he became Leo the 14th out of America under the Augustinian order. And you look at normally they have six ball bearers that carries a coffin. He had a 77 which is 14 which is right back to the Augustinian religion back to the original. And they said the minute he walks out there and you look at his regalia, his dress code, it'll tell you who he is. And when he walked out, he came with the ancient Roman regalia, showing you we're back there again to kill and to murder. The same regalia of ancient Rome. He wore the traditional red cape and trapped the traditional one that all the popes all those bad guys use. Trappings of the papacy suggesting a return to some degree of tradition after Franc's unorthodox pontific pontificate. So we back there with the old Roman Catholic order. Beyond that he has a possible first foreign trip at the end of May. Travel to Turkey to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the first council of Nia. Now that is what the pope before him wanted to do. That was his next trip to Nisha Rome. What do they want at N? What happened in Na Rome? Go and read what brother Bram says. What happened at Nia Rome? Everything is back there. All the bad things that happened there. a landmark event in Christian history and an important moment in Catholic Orthodox relations. So we are there again. So this guy we just have to wait for the right time when the devil stepped into him. Why? Because the Bible says, \"And it became night, nine days, and the devil stepped into Judas's scariot.\" The devil need to step into him. He needs to get the baptism of the devil because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is cut off. Now you understand why it says there is no Holy Ghost like in El Tabernacle. Nowhere. We are right at the point where anything can happen can happen. So that is what is going on. Then I'd like to say um he's a first American pope. We know that. And um he has a degree in economics. Top brass economical guy economics buy and sell him and Donald Trump. Imagine imagine it. It's right there. The scripture first put it. Brother Brennan says it in stature of a perfect man. We read it to you. And here it is playing out people. The economics of the world says and they won't be able to buy or sell. Why? Because revelation 6 says a measure of wheat for a penny, two measures of barley for a penny, weighing up the food of the world. I don't even want to speak about taxes. I don't even want to speak about I don't even want to go in there. Tariffs is taxes and the minute there's taxes, it's the birth of Jesus Christ. So will the return of Jesus Christ also determine taxes. We have it already. Tariffs is taxes. They're taxing you. They say they're taxing the outside world, but that taxes falls on you. So both of them, the Pope and Donald Trump, Revelation 17 and Revelation 13 is to do with economics, money. Oh my, I wonder El Tabernacle that you're going to get to the place now. I hope that you won't wait for these doors to open because a man stepped forward and said something is going to crack. And it did crack, it's supposed to shake ourselves to bits. I would like to put that scripture down. Uh when a man prophesy and it comes to pass, be scared of him. be scared of him. Now, I prophesied. I don't say you must be scared like uh I'm going to kill you or something, but scared that God is with me and I believe this is God, not me. Amen. So then then then watch this thing. Then watch this thing. They gave it nine days and then they started. When did they start with the election of the pope? Wednesday. What was Wednesday? The 7th of May. What happened the 7th of May 1946? The angel of the Lord came to brother Brandham. We'll give two quotes. I don't have it here. I forgot it. But we'll put it in. The angel of the Lord came to brother Brandham the 7th of May. Now, how could they have the election of the Pope the 7th of May and say Israel will be a nation? And the 7th of May they had the first election. Was that that the Catholic Church? Their wound will be completely healed. Is it? It's up to you to make up your mind. But for me, a new thing happened after the 7th of May. And after the 7th of May, now a new thing happened. A pope came out of America. It cannot be so perfect. It cannot be Amen. So prophetic that everything is just lined up. The Jubilees, everything is just lining up. The name is lining up. Everything is lining. The economy is lining up. Trump is lining up. He played Revelation 17 and he's Revelation 13. So my brethren, something did crack. 200,000 people at the funeral. 133 cardinals chose him and 130 heads of state there. All the nations represented all religions represented all news platforms was buzzing on this event. Even the Muslim network Alazer couldn't keep quiet but had a special representative there in Rome because they all wondering after the beast. This makes it a major major major thing that happened. So as I closed down, something did crack and something did happen. And the Bible says they wonder after him, small and great, rich and poor, the Bible says free and bond, wonders after him. This happened before our eyes. All of them was there. Like the Bible says, the pope should only be the pastor of the Roman Catholic Church or a imam or a rabbi. That's all that he is. Why does all the heads of state go there? If this is a church with a local shepherd, a local imam, a local rabbi, that means this should be the antichrist. No two ways about it. So everything to do with the end time is embedded in here. Everything about the a bomb, everything is revelation 13, Revelation 17. Both of them gets the a bomb and both of them is in play now. It's in season now. So you look at that wound being completely healed. Not wounded. It was wounded with nicer Rome and paple Rome and we know that but now completely healed. Nobody feels that they done anything by killing 100 million Christians in uh that's in the catacombs and what have you. It's completely healed the image to the beast. Revelation 13. They will hand it over to the beast very soon. And then I would like to say is just look at how many ministers just fell TD Jake. Look what happened to him. It's also worldly thing that happened. Look at um um Marcus Lamb. It's also a worldly thing. TD Joshua, look at him. What happened to him? Spiritual side. Everything cracked up. Look at what happened in Dio Gloria. And I said there that Raymond Thompson said that he gave out and bought the tapes and play bought the realtore tapes and bought the tapes and I said Raymond just tell me where you bought it from. I start the tape service bruti. I hired the hall. I paid signed the lease. I bought a real and I picked up the people and started tape services. Now I don't want to argue about who bought the reels. Raymond, all that I ask, tell me from who did you buy the reels. Please don't make a mistake here. From who did you buy the reals? Like you say, I would like to know. Now remember Raymond I know the history of aative so don't make a mistake here from who did you buy the reals that's all that I want to know and now it's after 5 months one of the days in the 6 months he still didn't answer so was that a lie brother so Renica was that a lie it sure was it sure was and I just wanted to know since when did he have a whole set of brother Brandham's cassette tapes? Not the real to real. The real to real. He's completely out. You don't even know where the real to reals was made. It was before his day. And I I I'm waiting for him to answer me. Then I'll I'll prove it to you where the real tapes come from. So uh but it's not answered which is a lie. Now, can a man come and stand in front of the whole world and make a statement that I bought the real truth. I this and I that and it was not him. He was lying and he bought the tapes. Now I can say he was lying and you guys are following him. I wonder if I had to do just one of the little things that he done, I would have been buried. All you ministers would have buried me. But these guys can sleep with women. They can lie. They can do whatever they want to and they still accept it. And here I am. You can't accept me. Why? Because we're playing in Revelations 13 and Revelation 17. He that's filthy, let him be filthy still. So church, may God bless you. El tabernacle, I wouldn't want to come here. It's just that now everybody was waiting for me in my church to say something about the pope and now I told you where it started from Revelation 13 because he wanted to tell me about Revelation 17 later on but I had Revelation 13 worked out and watched him and I just want to put Revelation 13 in Revelation 17 again. Can we have that clip as I close? There you are. Imagine this was supposed to be a joke and yet it came to pass. And Revelations 13 was portraying Revelation 17. And it came to pass. God bless you, Al Tabernacle. And I want to say it. Don't move from El Tabernacle. You're in the right place. Shalom.\n"}, {"id": "2024-08-21 - The Roar of the Lion in Revelation 10 - Pt 2  24 August 2024  Apostle Edgar H.

says hearing recognizing and acting hallelujah hallelujah but you got to hear first and once you hear you recognize that call and when you recognize that call you act upon it amen hallelujah [Applause] hearing what the spirit says that's why Revelations 1 10 and 11 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day when you in the spirit on the Lord's day what happens next and heard behind me a great Voice once you in the spirit then you hear the great voice amen thank God that El Tabernacle loves the spirit and we are in the spirit so you can hear a great voice amen El Tabernacle do we have the

[Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] hallelujah there will be a call to the resurrection Hallelujah the dead will hear it amen hallelujah the first thing Hallelujah that you that forms is the ear and after the ear forms amen and then you that baby starts hearing and that's why when that baby is born it hears its mother amen it knows the voice of its mother it can start crying but when Mama speaks the baby keeps quiet because in his mother's wound whom it heard the voice voice of the mother because the ear formed first Hallelujah and the last thing that shuts down when you die is the ear amen hallelujah it's a very important or organ oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] and that's why amen when Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell because it went into their ear when he spoke the words they heard the words and the Holy Ghost came an apostle speaks and the Holy Ghost comes when they hear the words of the Apostle amen when John was in the wom of his mother Hallelujah Mary just mentioned the name of Jesus because his ear was already formed in his mother Hallelujah and when he heard it he received the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb so when you hear it Tabernacle you can get the Holy Ghost when you he it Tabernacle you can be delivered when you he Al Tabernacle you can be healed you can be saved you can be Redeemed by the heing of your [Applause] [Music] [Applause] year [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] hallah [Applause] H that's why they say the ear when you hear the voice it changes into electricity and it goes to your nervous system that's why you can't keep quiet once you hear it those words are changed into electricity and that's why Hallelujah every fiber of your body moves uh it moves into emotions uh those words becomes emotions those words becom becomes a amen and an Hallelujah and a shabak and a glory glory amen it changes into electricity you get electrified you get charged up uh you get charged like a

hallelujah [Music] [Applause] amen amen [Applause] amen hallu hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I have recognized you now I act on it amen the word of God that's why they say you only hear what one ear you hear mostly with one [Music] ear hallelujah hallelujah you don't hear what both ears but you mostly hear with your right ear Hallelujah that's why the Bible wasn't wrong when God says give me your ears not your ears your ear he doesn't want your left ear but he wants your right ear Hallelujah even so we can hear what po ears our brains more efficient efficiently process speech heard with the right ear because those signals arrive more quickly in a children younger than 11 the right ear Advantage is the most noticeable hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so I

[Applause] Amen [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah I've heard that I'm one of them you have heard it but now you act on it God says you a son and a daughter of God you have heard it but now you act on it after it's reach your ear you say I believe it Lord I believe that I'm one of them I believe that I'm going into the Rapture I believe that I am a son and a daughter of the most high come from God and I'm going back to [Applause] God brother Clen what's the use you have an ear but you don't have a mouth because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God [Applause] and how will you he without the preacher the Bible says how will they hear if I don't send a preacher if I don't send a mouthpiece how will the year how will y Tabernacle year if there is no mouth to speak it amen [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without the preacher so you got a hear when there's a preacher if there's no pracher you can't hear so you can't have Revelations 108 out the [Applause] preacher and the Seven Thunders will give you Rapture in faith and what is Rapture in faith it's the oil it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you can't have Rapture in faith without the mouthpiece [Applause] [Music] oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah you can't have it you can't have it without the preacher you got to have a preacher amen hallelujah not all the preacher you can't have it but we got a preacher and we can hear it we can feel it we can love it we can be prepared for it to have Rapture in faith and what is Rapture in faith uh it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost H Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh Hallelujah I have raptured in FA hallu hall hallelujah he says when the eyes were open as the musicians comes up amen hallelujah we laugh at the preacher sometimes a good gospel preacher because he disagrees with our theology we make fun of him sometimes and even calls him that scandalous name of Holy Roller fanatic you don't know you might be talking about God when you do that oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so this man is very close to God when you say he's a Holy Roller he's a fanatic you might be speaking about God it's God in the preacher it's God in the Apostle it's God in you it's God in Me [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah hallall Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah h hallu amen just another one questions and answers on Hebrews Hallelujah 63 632 so you won't hear from nothing but you'll hear from a preacher Hallelujah and watch which has the greatest Authority an angel from heaven or an angel at the pulpit which has the greatest Authority that's why Paul says if an angel comes from Heaven Hallelujah and he doesn't say what I say let him he be a curse amen because the man in the pit though Michael is around the throne and Gabriel and Uriel the one in the pit has more Authority [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen the angel in the pit the angel in the poopet the angel in the poopet has more Authority amen s an angel up [Applause] there amen amen Apostle amen Apostle [Applause] amen that's why I can understand now when the apostles says that Mighty Angel when he dropped down he had to drop down into 26 elements because down here he doesn't have authority but in 60 26 elements he has [Applause] Authority a angel can't speak to you God needs a man a man with the mouth so that you can have an ear and hear what the mouth what the angel in the poop says to you and if the angel in the poop says you more than an overcomer then you more than of Overcomer because he's got Authority when he speaks Heaven stands at attention and says you better go answer my servant he's got more Authority than any angel in heaven then the answer must come uh then healing must come uh then Deliverance must come when the angel in the pulet speak then something must happen then the Holy Ghost will fall then something will happen to you and something will happen to me when he speaks something [Applause] happens amen [Applause] amen William Brenham can't speak anymore he's an angel in the Oran form but God will have somebody in the pit an angel behind the pit that has more Authority Hallelujah it means if he has more Authority than an angel in heaven it means he speaks before that angel when he speaks that angel must obey [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Music] Hallelujah Paul says if any angel from heaven comes and preach any other gospel to you than this which I've already preached let him be be a curse so the angel Anointed with the Holy Spirit and with the word stands next to God oh Hallelujah he's right in the throne amen he stands next to God Anointed with the Holy Ghost and Fire oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah do you believe y Tabernacle that the angel in the poopet has more Authority than an angel of Heaven do you believe El Tabernacle the angel in the poopit do you believe El Tabernacle the angel in the poopet do you believe do you believe do you believe have you heard the angel from the [Music] poopit amen amen amen amen amen amen the amen God the amen God the amen God I serve the amen God El tacle do you serve the amen God do you serve the amen God I serve the amen God God [Music]

Baptist [Applause] [Applause] s the Pentecostal experience under [Applause] that's why the people that has the Pentecostal experience gets such a lot out of a service [Applause] there is no time to sleep because the Holy Spirit is not gonna make you sleep [Music] [Applause] [Applause] they told Brother Branham how can you preach with all that noise and brother Brandon my answer them and said that's why I'm preaching [Music] [Applause] [Applause] I I've come down again too but every girl or husband and Jonathan as you feel the library dances yeah [Applause] we creature in the name of Jesus king God [Applause] [Applause] will ask him to bless you and we won't so I don't know I'm happy to be here [Applause] we came from bloemfontein and meeting them on Wednesday came down again to have this meeting and just greet you people [Applause] [Applause] are going up to George from yeah after the meeting I'm not gonna rush back home for the meeting next week [Applause] I have a busy schedule I like to be busy anyhow and try to look for that last soul [Applause] and I hope you are also looking for him [Applause] it could even be your friend that you walk with maybe every day to work it could even be a colic at work could be the neighbor it says you look for them [Applause] what else [Applause] let us look to make the time shorter now I don't know I still have a question mark with a you still got to be saved or whether he's gonna get the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be in because the baptism of the Holy Ghost put you in the church and when you come in from outside you only get converted so either way we sick and tired of this old world [Applause] song that's why we have been preaching in 40 countries and we didn't ask any of that 40 countries if we can come and visit them they send me invitation I don't go out to any country [Applause] unless they give me invitation [Applause] so I know there's some brethren as they travel they write and they ask if they could come and preach to their congregations around the world but I haven't asked any ever if I could come and visit their Church I was given invitations to the 40 countries and that's not the only countries that I visited I visited Taiwan Greece China of Africa with Zambia malao in Swaziland I visited Rome Italy Portugal and Malaysia and Singapore Argentina Wales Egypt Jordan and on and on and on it goes [Applause] [Applause] and right now it's been streamed right across South Africa this Gathering yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and by tomorrow it will be worldwide we do not ask them to come onto our stream but people knows where they can get something [Applause] [Applause] and so there's a lot of people a lot of ministers at streams but the people know they're not going to get anything so they don't listen to them they get sick so eight to ten or 20 people listening to their messages because there's no meat on the bone [Applause] and people you cannot fool them all the time [Applause] they're going to find out you look at animal life you'll find animals only there where they can get food the minute they don't get food they travel to another place [Applause] they might they might not like the place but because of the food that's there they might not like El Tabernacle but they like the food that's in our government so therefore we put the food on the table before them and you find them eating [Applause] another Pastor told me the other some time ago told me Brothers go all the two don't have to do please don't stop preaching because we're going to die [Applause] so foreign something you sound and it's selling Maybe you sound some things that the people want and they buy it why must you go and sell something that the people that don't want and leave the thing that you are selling that is actually bringing in something you'd rather leave the other thing and you go on to the thing that works [Applause] [Applause] so we are not gonna give this up for anything amen so may God bless you and uh you pray for me I pray for you [Applause] and remember we didn't come to church today we come here today to speak to something that will speak back to us [Applause] yeah [Applause] you're not going out here with an unanswered question May all your questions the answer is my prayer [Applause] so I think you know already what I'm gonna preach on because I streamed it and I am going to preach on it because I am the elders member in the message now in South Africa or in Africa in the whole of Africa and uh I am the only one that brother Branham laid the hands on [Applause] so so I should know what I'm talking about I I didn't come here to waste your time and waste my time because there is no time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we have to make sure that everything is in place for us to make it to the gate positively and I don't want to miss it amen therefore let's go to the word of God and let us put down what God wants us to have for this day because he says give us this day Our Daily Bread so may he help us to give you this day your daily bread I like to take two scriptures in Ecclesiastes three one three eight First Corinthians 3 6. and Zechariah 4 6. turning to Ecclesiastes chapter 3. verse 1. and then Ecclesiastes three verse 8. to everything there is a season and a Time to every purpose under the heaven everything has a Time and has a season for every purpose that God sinned on the Earth therefore it's essential to know what time you are living in and what season you are experiencing in the message of the hour we cannot just go on and says I am in the message and you do not know your time in the message and your season in the message because everything has a Time and a season then verse 8 it says A Time To Love and as I said when we spoke on George Martin's thing brother George Martin Pastor George Martin sing I said you can't love all the time and that made me sick in this message wherever you go you hear love love love nice humble love and it's wrong because there's only a Time and a season too long I want to come back there then it says A Time To Love and a time to you can't hate all the time you become an outlaw when you hate all the time but now you can't hate in the time of love That season you need to love and then you can't Love in the Time of hate and judgment Sodom couldn't get love because it was a time of judgment you must have your balance I'd like to take another scripture um as I said Corinthians 3 verse 6. 13 6 I'm sorry 13 6. it says that love rejoices not in iniquity love rejoice in the truth now how could you say you have love and there's no rejoicing in your church then you're a liar because love rejoice you can't have rejoicing Without Love then why isn't there rejoicing in the church because automatically there's no love then why is there such a lot of rejoicing in El Tabernacle now I'm asking you [Applause] because we put a thing the way God wants it have you got it did I speak to somebody right over the air in South Africa where they're listening to me have you got it Johannesburg all those places so no rejoicing No Love and then made it worse rejoice in the truth the truth is the word so they don't have the true word in its season and in its time [Applause] another scripture foreign chapter 4 verse 6. then it answered and spoke unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Jehovah Bell I like to put brother branham's name in there saying to brother Brennan it's not by might nor by power but [Music] father we thank you for the reading of your word you said that your word won't turn unto your Void but it will accomplish what it should and I'll pray that you would open it up punctuated anointed throw water on it Let It Grow and never stop growing Lord as we add add the seven birth pings of Malachi 4. I hand a meeting into your hands in Jesus name amen you may be suitable um uh time to love A Time To Love there's only a space of time to love and there's a time space to hate that's why brother Branham says we must be like Jesus Christ we mustn't get too soft that we don't clean out the church he says Jesus Christ went into the church with a whoop and he says he cleaned the church out [Music] now that was not the time to laugh that was not the time to be nice my brother that was not the time to be meek my brother that was not the time that we think that love had to cover the multitude of the Sun in the church that was a time of height because the prophet says he looked at them with hatred malice he was crossed when he looked at him and brother when it says where's your virtues now if you don't hear the balance you would says now how could this be love that was perfect Lord [Applause] that was perfect love when he cleaned out the church and hit on the cross when there was a sin on his right left hand side and guys gambling here at the foot of his is his his cross he looked down on them and he says I forgive you A Time To Love [Applause] so there's a Time To Love and there's a time to hate the Bible says he loves The Sinner that's why he says they know not what they do it was a time that it showed love but in the temple there was no time for love Sodom and Gomorrah there was no time to lie so so he says I hated Esau there was no time to allow [Applause] so I came to the conclusion What is love everybody speaks about love wherever you go love they think that when you rebuke people you don't have love when you tell them where they are wrong they say you have no love [Applause] and then the one that compromises with a guy that is wrong that guy's got love it's got love you know no he's got compromise he's compromising [Applause] give me the man that come up and said brother Roscoe you're wrong then I show you a man that loves me and he shows me in the Bible and he shows me in the spoken word then I would say yes that's a lot [Applause] when you straighten out somebody then they say Mr No Love and yet that's love so what is love What is love is allowed to compromise with your brother if he can't dance and he doesn't want to dance and he'll reject to dance and the Bible says You must dance and you tell him the Bible says so and he doesn't want to listen you are the one that has love but he hasn't got it because God's love is correct [Applause] that's why an El Tabernacle when you're wrong you're wrong [Music] [Applause] What is love I sat in a church in Kimberly in another guy got up and say yeah you must love and I knew it was for me and I look at him I look at this young man and I said this young man don't even know what love is but they speak about love What is love do they know what is love now what a queer title and subject this is What is love and I got it straight from Brother Brennan brother Brandon rejected King I think 1916. I think that's after he preach all the love messages and then after that he preached on the rejected King and the angel of the Lord came to him and he thought this is my chance this is my opportunity this is my time This Is My Season to ask the angel of the Lord and this is what he asked the angel of the Lord angel of God What is love brother praying didn't even know what love is I Didn't Know What Love Is a seventh messenger Didn't Know What Love Is and I'm asking the same question What is love and the angel of the Lord says William Branham you've been preaching it all the time he says but what he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost is love now who has love I've got news for you El Tabernacle El Tabernacle [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so what happened here president Didn't Know What Love Is that came out of the heart of the angel Into the Heart of the prophet then made known through the heart of an apostle this morning this morning this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so I know what love is but they never knew it because nobody ever preached it this is the first time somebody preaching that the baptism of the Holy Ghost Islam what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost drunk in the spirit what's the baptism of the Holy Ghost president shouting and jumping and screaming what's the battle of the Holy Ghost emotions Say Amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Applause] you know what they destroyed the library before reading the book they destroy the storehouse before they heard my message and now they're in darkness and our brother Branham tells you you don't have love until it is the Holy Ghost [Music] so you don't listen to them when they speak on love if they don't bring it from the Holy Ghost it's not God's love we want God's love we want God's love we want God's love we want God's love [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I listen to them as they preach on love and speak about love and love amen and I think in myself they don't even know what they're talking about [Applause] they mix love up with a fruit of love because I'm gonna jump the gun now Galatians tells you that the Fruit of the Spirit is love so love comes out of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's only a fruit [Applause] of the Holy Ghost and they say that is love that's not love the baptism of the Holy Ghost is love my brother it's love my sister it's love my sinner friend get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he will lead you into love [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh the either makes up love with the fruit of the spirit weakness and temperance godliness amen and niceness beautifulness and all that that's all fruit that's not love is the holy ghost that produce those things [Applause] do you understand [Applause] hermanus do you understand [Applause] [Music] so you never believe fables amen that's why you and El Tabernacle [Applause] and that's why you rejoice saying because the word of God has been preached [Applause] [Music] aren't you happy New Year [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] then they mix up love with fully Your Love for your love is not love there's only one love can you tell me which love [Applause] they brought us a belief loveman if you love a girl man are you going to be sad [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and if you love God [Applause] they mix up love the world makes up love everybody makes up love they think to give things to the poor and all that that's love that's not love there's only one love and it's God's love and God's love is a rebuking love because it's resumed it rejoices in the truth and the truth shall set you free [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] they mix up love amen they have a compromising love the guy the guy sleeps with every woman he gets and they still have him in the church paying tithes I give his tights back and says get out if I love him I'm going to correct him [Applause] amen [Applause] they believe in a in a compromising love the world believe in a compromising love why love hanging on a chain around their necks is in love but a perverted love and they feel religious would love hanging around the Nets on a chain love as a sticker on the bumper of a car is in love but perverted cloth and they feel secure because they've got love on the bumper of a car that nobody will steal that car that's not love they have love on a Signet of a ring amen that isn't love amen because tomorrow you can take that ring off and throw it away and say you have love that's not love they marry today tomorrow they divorce and the ring is gone that's not love and they feel they secure and they feel they're religious love displayed on a billboard of a building that's not love and they feel that they have salvation because love the word love is there I like brother Layman used to say he says don't come and tell me about love he says he's a loved one love on the postcard and a letter wrote to a woman or a man that's not love it's only a Feeling [Applause] then what is love it's not a Signet love on a ring it's not hanging around a neck it's not on a bumper sticker it's not the Love on a billboard or then what is love tell me church tell me I can't hear you I don't hear you that's too soft yes that is love according to Malachi 4 and according to the angel which is Jesus Christ [Applause] oh the baptism of the Holy Ghost is Alice it's everything [Applause] [Music] why must I settle for less when God gave me the Revelation like another Prophet told me he says you took the best out of the message I said what's that he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost I took the best and I've got the best because the baptism of the Holy Ghost as ours [Applause] foreign [Applause] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is even the blood because the token is the Holy Ghost even the blog the blood that cleans you that's even the Holy Ghost that's even the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost baptism is greater than the word brother Brennan said [Applause] [Music] so the baptism of the Holy Ghost sees everything [Applause] [Music] Church I'll come and creep and sit in the back there for what my ears year and what my heart fails I peel it in my hands I peel it in my feet I put it way over me the love of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] thank you [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] now listen to this they do not know what love is you know why because many love power they love power but I have no power to love they love power but they don't have power to love why because you can only get power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you have power to love Hallelujah blessed be my conscious man can preach man Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] I want you to say it with me many love power but they have no power to love what happened when I answered George Martin of Pastor George Martin I said there's no love they speak about love but they don't have power to enforce law they don't have power to send my brother I forgive you but El Tabernacle the power is here for you to love your brother to love your sister to love your enemy power [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] oh my they all speak about the blood [Music] but they never broke the blood but ultimate broke the blood vessel what came out of that what came out of that I want to hear from you what did come out of the blood vessel so that means you're under the blood [Applause] [Music] oh my God Jonathan in the Bible his father wanted him to portray David Jonathan in the Bible was actually hated by his father because of what because of the love he had for David [Applause] and you know what the Bible says the love between the two of them was greater than the love of a woman it was greater than polio love so what love was between Jonathan and David if it was greater [Music] [Applause] then what is the love in El Tabernacle [Music] a holy ghost love the real alarm [Applause] [Music] the baptism of the Holy Ghost alive [Applause] now listen to this preaching my God this guy can preach man listen to this preaching Amen brother Brahm says the guide which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost takes the Believer by the hand in a guide and he leads him into faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness he leads you into his own virtues he leads you into his own fruit amen the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and what I like and what I love after he led you right up then he says he lead you into the Holy Ghost then brother man put the Holy Ghost there and the next step is love and Galatians is the the fruit of the Holy Ghost is so the Holy Ghost gives you the Capstone that was for somebody somewhere [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] there is only one love and that's a couple of all the other loves is a perversion it gets weaker and weaker everything that's not the Holy Ghost is not perfect because when that which is perfect has come that's which is in part will be done away with because the quickening power the Holy Ghost will change this Mortal body [Music] keeping the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Music] [Applause] let me just eat this quickly a couple of his first John 4 16. God is a love and God is a spirit so the spirit has the fruits and all the fruits have the spirit fully Your Love is love for a woman Ephesians 5 28. its husbands love your wives a weaker love now it's not love God is love your wife it's a weaker love the third one as it comes down the ladder Heroes of love Evil's love is a sexual love goes into sex Hebrew 13 4 the bed is undefiled a week of love then it gets weaker it goes to stoic love stoic love is love for another man's wife Exodus 20. Thou shalt not come until thou tree [Applause] then it gets weaker it goes into free love free love free love amen Genesis 6 they took them to themselves wives they didn't marry them free love then it gets weaker it gets into lust full love Matthew 5 28 who sayever look upon a woman and lust after her has commanded adultery with her already lustful love [Applause] listen I can't help for what God gave me I can't help for what a preacher I am I can't help from a gift God gave me I came from the conference of God and I don't read the spoken word like all the other ministers God leads me different [Applause] [Music] then it comes to the loss Brother Bruno says then he comes to the last ungodly love which is Romans 1 24 homosexual love Solomon Gomorrah then God comes into the flesh it's a homosexual love then he comes down himself to come and see if it is soul Amen in homosexual love when it hits homosexual love it leads the the color violet it comes into the color violet and God become a man [Applause] [Applause] when you get here it's so far away from a couple so far away from the spirit of God that it's not resembling God anymore but is resembling the Lucifer then it goes further amen into a a a a furtherance from the agape love it goes into incest father sleeping with their daughters it breaks down it becomes worse and worse and worse and worse are we there [Applause] then you have men sleeping with animals it's also love so what is love those six steps or seven steps is not love there's only one love and that's the Holy Ghost and you don't want it you message groups don't want it and he says that in rejected King when the angel told him that love is the Holy Ghost rejected King is the Holy Ghost rejected of course it was rejected in this message they didn't want to jump they didn't want to have that Pompa do mix up they didn't want to act like maniacs but I'm like Paul my father in the way that Paul Harris say I'll serve the god of my fathers if they don't like it I don't care I'm like David I will dance before the ark because love rejoices in the ark [Applause] come on [Applause] and I don't know how you feel hermanus if you feel like your pastor then you'll do what your pastor do if he dances you will dance [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Love Comes weaker as it comes into almost sexuality and then God said Michael Gabriel step into this why Lord he says we're going to take a little stroll [Applause] where to Lord going down to the plains of memory who's in the plains of memory is a plain and simple guy by the name of Abraham [Music] [Applause] but I'm not going to visit Abraham I want to visit Sarah [Music] when God comes into the flesh he don't worry about the prophets he worries about his bride [Applause] [Music] and if God comes into a flesh now he don't care about anything else for great is a mystery of godliness God men are pasted in the flesh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he says on the Holy Ghost take 1958. and they come all the way down from a couple to folio love and down to lustful love to the lowest than God himself became man when it comes to the lowest of love then God puts on flesh [Music] when man comes to their lowest and they reject love because the Bible says in Matthew 24 it says that this is what it says for the love the Holy Ghost of many shall wax cold when it comes to that step is the love works cold in the church what love the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost accepted that's why he put the quote in the rejected King because a rejected King is the Holy Ghost [Music] he even takes it for the book the Hebrew book page 157 you can go and read it oh El Tabernacle we can't read the spoken word like thing we're really different because we duck people [Applause] and we're drinking strange Waters plus his strange Waters you hurt it's true never heard it before that makes El Tabernacle so unique and it makes the ministry unique and make people want to know more and you know the quote I gave it to you in the Sin of unbelief he says the word the Holy Ghost is a quick to give than the word amen it's great to lie because you wrote the word says brother I said the Holy Ghost said [Applause] [Music] that's what I'm preaching now amen came out of brother Branham but I say that the Holy Ghost gave it to me because everybody read it and they don't know anything about it and they never ever mention it and they never ever preach it and they never ever testify about it and they never ever wrote about it but there's one Oddball a man that has grabbed it and heard it and preach it and now it is revealed in the Tabernacle [Applause] [Applause] oh my love what is it because faith is love on the battlefield it heals sickness and raise the Dead virtue is love that goes out to others a time to laugh knowledge is love in respond it response to everything knowledge Temperance is love in training controlling your tongue patience is love patience is love in all situations godliness is love incompleteness because God is alive [Applause] El Tabernacle in Africa what are you listening to you're not listening to a preacher you're listening to an apostle of God that gets the word out of the mouth of God [Applause] [Applause] [Music] brotherly kindness is love in action loving your brothers action not with talk action showing action loving for your brother action esteeming your brother higher than yourself that's love in action [Music] and the Holy Ghost is a loving self [Music] [Applause] can you say man man [Applause] Oh My ultimate you can't finish the tapes that I preach there's too much meat on the bone El Tabernacle is more worth than all the tides that you pay those are two year now your Tides can't pay for it God will pay me when I get there [Applause] [Applause] I ask you to support me and you did and that's why you get this because you support me and along you support me I'm telling you you're gonna get it [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now we're preaching What is love somebody somebody somebody somewhere has quoted [Music] [Applause] that's why when you go to Corinthians 13 and you read about love the only thing it shows him it says love Saturday long that's the Fruit of the Spirit it's a love is kind of Brotherly kindness that's a fruit of the spirit Corinthians says love envied not is another fruit of the spirit because it's got kindness with it [Music] amen it's gentle another fruit of the spirit I'm reading Corinthians 13. [Music] it's not easy provoke why because it's full of joy it's a fruit of the spirit it beared all things amen that's the Fruit of the Spirit patience like job beareth all things is the Fruit of the Spirit I'm in Corinthians 13. it believe all things another fruit heir to your faith Faith believes God it's a fruit of the spirit I just want to read Corinthians 13 here First Corinthians 13. I just want to read it and I mention it to you but now let me read it verse 4 5 and 6. love charity suffer of law fruit of the spirit love is kind fruit of the spirit charity fruit of the spirit love Galatians 5 and the fruit of the spirit is alive it goes deeper I'm coming to that then we can close vaunted not itself is not puffed up because it's got a joy unspeakable do not behave itself unseemingly you listen to me amen you shut up Bishop if you don't say the Holy Ghost is a love then you shut up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the Lord the Bible [Applause] we could not own fruit of the spirit is not easy to provoke think of No Evil and verse 6 Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice in the truth now watch Galatians at the same God that wrote this road Galatians and in Galatians he comes and he says Galatians 5 22 he says and the Fruit of the Spirit is love now you don't say love and the spirit is the same thing now he makes love the fruit [Applause] and he don't stop there he says now the truth of the spirit is love and not love is and now the Holy Ghost is the fruit of the spirit but the fruit of the spirit is love love is a fruit why is love a fruit because love wasn't there before the foundation of the world there was no hate there because Lucifer was not even created so there was no hate there so love wasn't there but the spirit was there [Applause] now Paul says my brother the fruit of the spirit is love and what does he do next he says love joy Out of Love Comes Joy now how could they have love and they don't have joy because Paul says out of the spirit comes love Out of Love Comes Joy [Applause] [Applause] oh my thank you [Applause] you can't love without the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost bath love that's why the Holy Ghost must lead you up the stairs in my guide he says that because what he's leading you into is his fruit it's Galatians 5 22. so they take the fruit as love the fruit is not love it's a fruit of love the Holy Ghost amen I'm going to close I think you're blown out the bulbs are going like this out of love come Joy so give Jesus king God a boasting shout here [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] just another five minutes this is the way you should read First Corinthians 13. this is the way you ought to read it though I speak with the tongue of men and angels and don't have the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm a sounding grass and a tinkling symbol this is the way the proper way to read it and though I have the gift of Prophecy and I understand all the Seven Seals and understand serpent seed and I understand the Mysteries that William Branham brought though I know all those Mysteries but if I don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost Paul says you are nothing though you're 40 years in the message amen and you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are nothing [Applause] [Applause] though you are a big preacher a Treasurer a trusting a deacon amen a member for 40 years Amen in the message though you quote the prophet like this without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are nothing [Music] though you'll have faith to remove mountains seven Thunders and seven Thunders and seven Thunders and nobody ever got the faith of it why because without the baptism of the Holy Ghost nothing works go you bestowed your goods to feed the poor and you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost it profits you nothing being in an end time Church you miss it you won't be considered Moses was not considered when he didn't have it God wanted to kill him because he didn't give it to his son brother Branham was not considered that's what his wife and his child was taken and you pastors think you're gonna make it when the prophet was actually a man under judgment when he didn't take it you're not going to be considered [Applause] I'm closing my God I'm closing love poinsure to the Holy Ghost as I said Colossians 5 26 2 says the fruit of the spirit is love thy doesn't say death love is equal with the Holy Ghost it says that's but just the fruit the same writer and I Echo amen why now you think love is going to save you love don't save you it doesn't the Bible says by Grace I will say not by Allah oh my it's so much deeper it's so much deeper love is the Fruit of the Spirit it leads us so deep the holy spirit will give you love so if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost your Void of perfect love you might have love but one of the other loves because Romans 5 5 says the love of God is abroad in your hearts by the Holy Ghost [Applause] love comes into your heart only by the Holy Ghost so what is the Holy Ghost lost so how are you going to get love if the Holy Ghost supposed to put it in your heart so El Tabernacle you're right there you're right there with a Bible and with what brother Branham says and with Apostle anointing it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let me lay it down the prophet says in Israel and the church page 51. paragraph 122. he says the holy spirit is the love of God I can prove it by the Bible he's challenging them he knows they don't know it because he never knew it and the word comes to the prophet and a prophet gives you to the apostle and the Apostle makes it clear because man comes behind me I can prove it by the Bible and we proved it by the Bible too [Music] so what is love What is love joburg What is love Pretoria What is love hermanus What is love [Applause] [Applause] rejected King 1960 he preached this quality others he already preached now I always wondered you know I always wondered when I read eleventh commandment how come in 11 Commandments he rebukes Canada so bad very bad don't read it or put the tape on and I thought now this man is preaching on love how can he rebuke the people can't you just forgive them or just look over it no he rebuked them writing that book and I couldn't understand it and when God opened it to me he says no he was showing you to love because love is corrective agopo love is corrective and that's why he rebuked them because they had no joy they were stiff and stodgy and stale and dead conservative and the Holy Ghost says I'm preaching on love and you have no joy and if he built them made this message churches that's dead May the year the prophets rebuke them [Applause] I'm closing it's better to light a candle in the dark then to curse the darkness so what is love let us read rejected King 1916 515. if there be those here listen to him he's praying now if there be those here Lord who doesn't know you in that way of love they know the other way of love nicey nicey one the folio one the one that compromises so that everybody can like them they know that one but it's big clear about that one is the one we're preaching on now if there's anybody that don't know it that's a love now watching watching without that type of a love then he says what type of a love the new birth the being born again the Holy Ghost is love if there's anyone here that don't understand it Lord may you open their eyes that the Holy Ghost is love [Applause] open our eyes in El Tabernacle for the scripture and the Bible say the same thing and the Apostle anoint said I'm an anointing it [Applause] I'm closing brother branches and restoration of the bright tree he says the canker worm has added away the joy of the church and then he said shh you're making too much a noise he says it's a Kinko worm but an oddball from Johannesburg [Applause] kills that canker worm and now it's even in Cape Town give God a shout here I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'm gonna close for the love of many wax cold many vexed the Holy Ghost and it took its flight and the churches is cold they tried to clap their hands they can't even collect them why because the love of many [Applause] and now we're closing and as he calls on that message the wings of a snow white now it says Lord on the wings I will slow life down God said he's pure sweet love who brings love the wings of the dark what's the dog the Holy Ghost [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm closing and I want you to be like Noah and not like the message group Noah broke open the word because the word kept the dove in bondage the ark he couldn't fly but we want to right now release the dove because on its ways is the love of God if the Holy Ghost fly in here don't reject him if the Holy Ghost flies in here don't push him aside if the Holy Ghost flies in here lift up your hands and says not my mother my mother is not my father it's not my brother it's not my sister to me it's me standing in the need of prayer as the dove fly over this audience we're releasing yes you can feel him I know you came he's flying in this bowling right now [Music] on the wings of a Snow White so let the dark lie we're not keeping in prison raise your hands and say Lord It's Me it's me standing in the need of prayer Lord don't cage up the door open the door of your heart let him fly out of the Ark and settle on your ground with all I believe in his mouth [Music] oh I just want the dog to lead me home I just want the dove to lead me home I just want the dove to lead me home [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] somebody somebody has caught the dog let's go [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] my brother and sister before the dog flies to Israel we want to keep him here we want to go after it maybe tomorrow will be too late but we want to keep him here [Music] I told the last one has caught the dog [Music] he's moving here he's moving here he's moving into

them from all or wrong does anybody that's sick here Lord I pray that you will heal them in the name of Jesus Christ we rebuke the work of the devil in your name thank you Lord amen I just want to finish this quote and then may God bless you he says further the Holy Spirit God is love we know that is true no matter if we remove mountains now he's showing us to Corinthians 30. by our faith if we did great things still without that without the baptism of the Holy Ghost we could never climb that great ladder can't climb it but with it we have cliented look at it the love of God bless you on the

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] I I wonder how do you feel did I tell you the truth that there's no church like El Tabernacle every girl told me they had the back it says man it's just nice to be back you people are something else man God don't have to beg you to worship Him you just do [Music] it so God bless you and we're happy to have you [Applause] back oh and I would like to uh thank everybody I realize I did with uh the New Year's meeting and uh there's other brothers that I didn't mention if I didn't mention your name remember you included in the names of the other people amen we all one amen so I want to thank you the ones that supports the cause here with their tithes offerings and presents and special offerings we um want to thank you once again I want to thank the nurses last weekend Sunday I was laying with pipes in me and they came over Sunday and they come in and ministered to me and um this week I Hopple along I didn't know if I'm going to make make it in the poop this evening but I'm here so I want to thank them uh for coming and uh I don't know which doctor was behind them that gave the inscription for the nurses to administer to me so I thank God and uh may God richly bless you I feel fine and then uh I just want to say that um we straighten our things and uh it's just the kimy um an ail's problem you seen Adel quite back for quite some time and Ed said uh him and Kimmy is not together for a year and a half they they've decided that they want to serve God they divorced [Music] hallah and uh Ariel told us that um he don't even want to bother the Rosco family we must just allow him to come to church and um is doing just that and uh Kimmy called me in I think about a month ago or so and you you know I take my time I like to pray over things she told me that she's back in chelberg and uh she and a is not together and she said she knows that they have done wrong which I told the world you know brother when I said it if they don't do what I tell them they going to hell my son or who ever he is amen the word of God has no biasness it's like [Applause] [Music] that and they listened to me and she said well she realized that she' done wrong she asked forgiveness and um she says well she didn't do anything else because all the time time she just wanted to serve God and uh I said well if they're not together and they have separated and they live like single people by all means it's fine they could come serve God so um we uh also laid down a few things that U they have to do that's why I took a little time for to make the announcement here so um IO to God that God would look down on them and show Mercy amen and then I I need to tell you this one a certain brother by the name of brother Benny I think Edwards that Indian brother that came from Newcastle and he came and served God here and he left here and he went to branky and I don't know he left there where the deacy is now I don't know but apparently he said he was praying and God spoke to his heart and he spoke in tongues and the interpretation was a message to brother Rosal and uh he found Charlton is Charlton here Charlton right at the back there and he told Charlton to hand over the message to me and the message was uh through tongues and the message was in three parts one I must give over L Tabernacle to Jonathan two I must get my house in order and three I must present I must repent and God will show me of what so I've listened send him a message back and um I just felt that this God that has spoken to him it's a bit mixed up [Applause] um maybe maybe you heard from hery Krishna [Applause] now why I say so is that I let him know and he was in the church he knows it I think 20 years ago I then did handle the church over to Jonathan who's the head pastor of el Jonathan is running the church the Deacon board the trustey board the ministers the Bings for 20 years now you want to tell me my God don't know that [Applause] Point number two get your house in order well the thing is is that if it means my natural house there's only one in that house that's me you want to tell me God don't know that now what house must I get in order if it means I must get myself in order that entails when brother brandham and them speak about it that my time is up I'm busy living that one I welcome because I've been struggling in this poopit for 59 years and I worked because I want to get in there [Applause] number three is I must repent God will show me of what now again I don't understand this God I'm busy with my God every morning between 2: and 4: every morning between two and four I plead my case I beg him I think Denny still sleeps and snores that time when I'm busy with [Applause] him since a young man I never ever stopped praying at that time up till now so of what must I Repent when I Repent every morning for Thought word and deed and I ask God for your repentance and to forgive you Al every morning [Applause] now say for instance I had something and I asked God for forgiveness every morning you'll forgive me isn't that making my house in order or how do you get your house in order by repenting now I can't understand how funny this God is when he came to David he told David he son when he came to Moses he told Moses he son wherever he went he tell the people what they sinned but when it comes to Edgar Osco you don't tell me what's my son so I say this and not to be funny let his hery Krishna God go to hell and I cannot understand why can God speak to you know when I was in India they call guys like that num poop talk to a guy like that but he speak to me 59 years for 59 years he spoke to [Music] me can you see what I go through church [Music] now I see the colonell on Thursday I don't see him yet tonight um I went over there and uh I went going to ask him to check all the Rosco's phones if it's not hacked that's a word right and uh because I feel something funny and uh he says no by Monday you'll know if your phone is hugged and uh somebody breaks into your phone to listen to you but I would like them to check all the Rosco phones so be careful what you speak over your phone exactly amen my Lord I and he told me um they can do it and they can trace the people and uh the thing is this that um what happened when they broke into my house and uh what I don't understand is I I'm a very Thrifty guy with my celery I I always put something away even if it's TR but I must put money away I don't spend my whole wages so they knew exactly where I put the money and they stole all that money just came in the house take the money out of the house where I sted it now who knows that so I made them check the house the same guys that's going to check the phone uh special guys from the force and I must say they're very good they picked up everything check my car everything if it's um not uh the dubbed or and uh they picked up things because we we put in some uh security systems you know three of them if the one fail the other one will get you that one fail the other one will get you and they picked it up and I knew know these guys are professional so they checking they're going to check our phone and uh we will know who it is he mentioned names to me already but I'll keep quiet and it's a criminal offense to do a thing like that so we will know by Monday what's happening there so that's what uh the vision of brother Indian now I'm also half Indian I'm mixed up anyhow I don't even know what I [Music] am I I love for um no no I said we pray I prayed that time in the morning and I I just wake up I don't have an alarm he wakes me up exactly that time to talk to me all my life [Applause] and then when Mahari come and she starts at 8:00 and we have another prayer meeting and then I go and do my chores after that so a lot of prayer goes into the thing understand and um so yeah um the colonell will let us person all by Monday and then um that was not the first time it happened um that a thing like that um occurred I was give over the church uh December another guy came from America Luke Gibson I don't even know the guy a Johnny come lately that also wants to be on the pedestal and he came and he preached in brother tm's previous Church where um the concerns took over elwin m Christopher start I called him the three Baptist preachers I wonder how could tum all Baptist like that guys that's not anointed put him out of his church I'll take all three of them one time and Chuck them out in front of everybody no guy with no Holy Ghost mess around with us man I know God [Applause] [Music] [Music] you know the meetings that we have in El Tabernacle mixup meetings people laying on the floor screaming jumping visions and all that PE Tabernacle never had one meeting like that for all the years that twim was there even now so how can they tell me [Applause] that's what thing that's why the thing busted the way it did so he comes around Mr American you know I never worried about American when I see American and I take out my sword there a bunch of brags man [Music] and he preached in that church a lot of things about me my clothing and my dancing and all my ministers and all that but the thing he said other this is in one month Benny and him I just realized God speak to this one God spoke to that one and God spoke to him to preach through the through his preaching that I follow a Lal priesthood by handing the church over to my sons and we're not in the leidal priesthood we in the mesc priesthood that's what he said now if he comes from America and he knows that I gave it over to Jonathan how come Benny don't know how come this little Indian boy don't [Applause] know and then he's got the audacity to say I must come and see him I must run after him a man like [Music] me he must go to heav Krishna man [Music] now in so many words Gibson was also emphasizing hand over the church I cannot give it to my sons I must give it to somebody outside of the family yeah I've got Benny Benny says You must give it to your to Jonathan here Gibson comes and says no I can't to who did God speak to the two of those guys how come God gives two different messages in one month that's not my God one month [Applause] I'm sorry I am very very sorry to which one must I listen to then we had brother bapes brother Shan's son-in-law brother Shan's son-in-law that was with that Prophet the two of them together uh can you see I don't do these guys nothing so all the devil's eyes is upon [Applause] [Music] [Music] and they founded us and says that God spoke to this Prophet guy and to bapes I hope Garden jinda listen to what I got to say now and then they told Jonathan that God spoke to the prophet and told the prophet through babes that they're coming up to joerg and uh with all the papers transfer papers because God said we must hand the church over to them [Applause] and they told Jonathan they said Jonathan just keep the title deeds and a pen you just sign and all the rosos must get out of the church they'll take [Applause] over and Jonathan answered and Jonathan says yeah come come come up brother where are you now he says no we're on our way we just getting the last papers and we'll be there so Jonathan says come up man brothers because God spoke to me too [Applause] and God said if you come up here we'll be waiting for you we'll give both of you some blue eyes like Coleman that's what God told us we never heard from them again hallu so brother Godwin don't say that we didn't handle the man I handled [Applause] him then we were in elders and uh the church was growing and I put up that um balcony there and the church was growing and another guy walked up to me that's in the church he says Pastor Ros I have a message from God to you I said yeah what's it he says I had a vision and in the vision I saw your shoeses walk through I said now what does that man mean it means your ministry is finished and God is going to take you and you must give over the church to me and then in 1987 when brother Raymond Thompson and them split the church not they let they split ugly I heard the knock on my door stadi in anadale I opened the door yes stand a man when I looked at him it was Mr Bon beer Greg's Bon Bear's father and Kenny alus and Cliffy Marshall's stepfather he the man stand at the door I said good afternoon what's the best in bear he said good afternoon he says I don't have much time I have a message from God to you I said to him okay he said can I come in came in my wife let him sit he said don't even worry to make tea this is a a quick thing because you must do it right now and C Bon Beer's father then said God spoke to him him and God told him that I must repent and I must give the church over I said Mr Bon beer when did God say I must give it up say right now if I walk out here you must just hand it over I said oh right now yeah and I looked at him my wife standing there I said was the best you tell me what God is this said what do you mean I said you stink like a tobacco Factory you just smoked before you came here I said then you got to T in you too but does God don't tell you you must must repent of that tobacco repent of that drinking repent of your [Applause] falseness if I didn't have the Holy Ghost they would have taken the church but because I walk with the angel they will never get it right [Applause] so I feel like Jesus telling Peter Peter I pray for you because the devil want to Ser you church I pray for you cuz the devil is after you because there is no church like this church [Music] so after all these years they want to take my wife [Applause] now now that's not something new aimc wanted to take Sarah from Abram and God say you're a dead man and Benny you're a dead man you're a dead man [Music] [Applause] you know the guys that broke into my house we afterwards found the tag they used my tag for a whole year to go in and then we traced them and we went to the to the gate there with the insurance company they don't know how they got that tag my tag of all the people and then we throw the guy we got his car we got his number plate we got his address then brother Co and I went to his house and then he wasn't there and his wife told him so koven and them waited for a couple of weeks and they went back there when they went back there the wife says no he's in hospital says what's wrong brain Dam up till now you don't play with a man of God we had to close the case because the guys are vegetable and it just happened they don't know what how it happened and we will get them that hugs our [Applause] phones okay that was my commands you see you have to pray for this man let's go to Exodus 19 verse 19 and let us see how far we can get into this message Exodus chapter 19 verse 19 and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder Moses spake and God answered him by a voice father I give this scripture into your hands I'm not capable I'm just your servant may you grant unto me the [Music] Insight of this word that I want to preach tonight I pray that he that has an ear let him hear May El Tabernacle be encouraged once more [Applause] I hand it over into your hands Lord thank you Jesus amen you may be [Applause] seated amen now I had um a phone call from somebody and he told me he said brother Rosco I've listened to all the conventions that was held over the Christmas the one in Dubai the one here the one in Deo Gloria the one in oton and there one in brother toam old church and he says I was searching for the Holy Ghost in all those conventions because all of them was echoing out we need the Holy Ghost we need the Holy Ghost and now it's not in my church and he said to me he said you know I don't find that thing that's in your church nowhere Hallelujah [Applause] even the one that people went to Brazil they don't have it like [Music] [Applause] it's so we are going to to have to fight to keep it

bad news also over social media where they said in dear Gloria that the Holy Ghost left for 40 years there was a lapse for 40 years bad news the Holy Ghost isn't there's bad news but in El Tabernacle it never ceased so where is the good news [Applause] P bad news then they trumpeting out no scriptural Doctrine 7,000 Seven Virtues that's bad news that's New York City's garbage SC it comes out of it comes out of New York City garbage [Applause] scan it's garbage there's no Bible for it how can you believe in it anything that's not Bible is [Applause] garbage seven Thunders is not the Seven Virtues because the Bible don't say so brother brandham don't say so I rode the track on the seven Thunders and I found difficult to get out to the Seven Virtues I wanted to go to okar but I found myself in Pick and Pay and then I found myself in checkers but I want to be in O Bazar so I had to go and scratch to try make the thing work at the end I didn't have a scripture and I look I say he this is a bunch of garbage FR one FR and I'm going to play it when I preach against the LIE of the Gloria and then they can write me a lawyer letter but this time I'm going to court everything is going to come out this time and I want the newspapers to be there this time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but now brother Rosco have you got Bible for the seven Thunders Hallelujah being the seven Messengers Hallelujah well I'd like to call up our English teacher that's got a decree in English and that marks the papers of the grade 12 for the Department not like me and brother Raymond that didn't even Pass Time Sate five now I could I could ask the doctors here and I could ask the engineers here but I'm going to ask her because she's now like the authority on English as far as the department is let us hear from her okay bless you amen I'm going to put the scripture on the board and he crowd with a loud voice as when a lion roar it and when he had cried seven Thunders utter their voices now I just want her to explain that three words there utter there and voices I want to go and sit and I hope elado Park Assembly listens because you're following a lie in Alor good evening Al Tabernacle I think you are going to be my biggest class I've ever taught so here we go let's English so to utter means to speak say or Express something aloud often in words so take note they're not sounds they are sounds that are articulated in meaning so if an animal makes a sound you can't interpret it as a human being animals understand animals but when you utter as a person it comes across in words and therefore meaning the word there so we're not talking about the place t h e r e it's t h i e um e i r is a possessive pronoun now take note pronouns are used for people so if you want to say uh if you want to make your sentence um syntax correct you won't say the Apostle said that the Apostle will take the sermon in the apostles Church you say the Apostle said that he will take the sermon in his church so in this case the word there is not for one person but for many persons good so far okay let's go to voice voice is the sound produced when air from the lungs passes the vocal cords causing them to vibrate and it is shaped by the throat the tongue and the mouth into speech or song so if we pause there a moment take note that when the sound comes through your vocal cords so vocal chords in this case remember produces the sound so there's a difference between human sound and animal sound because although a whale makes a sound and can articulate meaning to another well you as a human won't understand it but now humans on the other hand have vocal chords they produce sound that articulate words and expression for meaning so in order for you to understand what the Apostle is saying he must produce the sound from his vocal cords through his mouth and then you will understand exactly what is happening in his mind and in his heart so let's just tie it to the scripture and please I'm not a preacher I'm only a teacher so here we go the seven Thunders had to utter words that carried meaning as indicated by the fact that what was said could have been written down so if you're going to the next verse in verse 4 that angel would not have been able to write anything or record anything if it wasn't words if it wasn't meaning so in essence that angel would have had nothing to record and we would not have been able to hear what comes from this gift over the [Applause] pulpit so let's link it back to the humans right because the argument is that the virtues are the Thunders and it can't be because a virtue is not a physical body a phys physical body carries vocal cords it needs to be within a human form and a virtue is not a human form it cannot articulate meaning it cannot carry or produce meaningful words in any way so I think the Apostle's view his standpoint his his anchor what is trying to bring across is that it is just not true it is fallible from the start thank you good good rala 10:4 now how could God use three words that actually refers to human beings they say if somebody actually come back on anything repeat anything then he actually he tells you watch but now he does it three times and show three times it's human [Applause] beings right then how can we be wrong when the Bible says it's human beings I don't care about elado Park I don't care about de Gloria I worry about the word of God go oh this will be nice in a court when if we go to court with a thing like this and they come with virtues the judge is going to shake his head man he's never going to agree with them he's going to agree Hallelujah with the truth amen seventh under seven virtues is garbage that's why when their founder died they said he's coming back with blue eyes [Applause] garbage now there you have it you know a nutshell now Sister Shanti that last verse also refers so clearly and plainly seal up those things which the seven Thunders so the seven Thunders uttered it which means it was spoken aloud it was spoken aloud so capital S seal so all seven was the seals that's what of the BAM says that there's a [Applause] scripture thank you we have the truth man and the Seven Thunders is our doct and the right Doctrine because the Bible said [Applause] so and that's the good news the good news the seven Thunders are banging [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] together Hallelujah now brother Owen pal likes English you know he's a typical English guy he gets excited when you hear English you think he's going to believe seven Thunder Seven Virtues after this I tell you he's not going to believe it because the Bible said [Applause] [Music] so okay let's take some interpretation on the Bible on Revelations 3 where Revelations 3 said is the seven messenges let's take Bible on Revelations 3 oh my what does the Africans say now we got the English say cl [Applause] cl po arus Mar Cola [Applause] man are these guys [Applause] [Music] [Applause] mad a virtue needs you need a body a virtue don't have a body we heard [Applause] so seven [Applause] bodies just play that again in fore do you think these guys but ex all offer up your stem Amen on [Applause] I just can't be wrong elado Park Assembly I can't be [Applause] wrong Hallelujah [Applause] and [Music] to and he be the off [Applause] now we got an English saying the seven Thunders is seven men human beings and God emphasizes it four times in Revelations 10 that it's human beings four times to ever add to this prophecy all the plagues all the [Applause] plagues now they can't come out anymore and accept this huj they get sealed with that lie brother sorry Rica told me yeah you you nail them all but they don't come out I says praise God you you speak like like Pharaoh spoke out of his own mouth come judgment that means they're in a wall City they Bard in their ear they can't come out can't hear the gospel [Applause] trumpet okay next we go to English Revelation 10:3 and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices that's a French and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not that's what the french says the same thing let's have the Greek prophetic di clot that's a Greek the DI clot and this is what it said yeah I read it and this is the Greek and that's what it means and crowed with a loud voice as a lion roars and when he cried the the seven Thunders after to their voices the Greek says the same thing all the languages says the same thing only the bush in in in in elor Park El Park can say it's it's honors amen but bu Hallelujah we said seven Thunders is the seven Messengers [Applause] okay thank you [Music] [Applause] you need to ground your people now we in the Bible right did you see it for yourself [Applause] okay brother brandham spent his whole life trying to get us back in the Bible his whole life that's why El NE we can't take anything that's not in the Bible [Applause] okay the uncertain sounds he says God will keep his word no uncertainty about that when the trumpet of God sounds in your ear it doesn't change your ear listen to what it says if it sounds in your yeah it doesn't then change right okay the ear job 34:3 when it sounds in your ear [Applause] the ear the ear tries now if you say seventh th Seven Virtues the ear try that and say that's not the word am I right I don't hear [Applause] if alerado Park amen say seven Thunders is is a seven virtues then the ear said no man brother brandham don't say so the ear tries it how can I help it my ear ties there and I find out that's not the melody of the word of almighty God that's not aen in the gim sheet of the great [Applause] Shalom even you you go to any church and you sit there and then you come out you says no man this is not why because your ear try [Applause] [Music] it can you turn to the one that's next to you and tell him or her you see my ear tries everything that comes from the pit [Applause] because it has no uncertain sound when anybody preach anything that brother brandham never said it's an uncertain sound seven Thunder Seven Virtues uncertain sound carbage of New York City [Applause] and when the ear years the gospel trumpet it's all finished then you can't help the people they can go to Brazil they can go to another church they can go to England but the year it know am I [Applause]

of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord you do show the Lord's dead till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink

abstract from communion it says you see each day we've got to commune with Christ we've got to talk to him each day so if your physical body need food each day to survive your spiritual body needs spiritual food and communion with the Lord each day to survive so each day we have to go to to start stud the Bible but a real real believer that's really spiritually built up he reads his Bible every day and he talks to the Lord that's right amen and we also have the guideline that we have to follow I think this guideline is we have it on our phones amen everyone has this guideline is the

passes lead us not into temptation Deliver Us from Evil give us our daily bread Lord not yesterday's bread but today's bread modern events bread father we ask of you that you'll be so kind and go with

predestinated it pray that you bless us bless the listeners bless El Tabernacle around South Africa and outside of South Africa in Jesus name amen now I entitled this a little should I say message or whatever the USA a woman's Nation Revelations 13 and I stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his head the name of bless me and the Beast which I saw was unto a leopard and his F were as his feet was a bear and his mouth as a mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seed and great Authority and I saw one of his heads as it it was wounded to death verse four and they worshiped the dragon which gave power upon unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is who is like unto the Beast who is also to make war with him and and was given unto him among speaking great things and verse 8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world verse 11 is the thing and I behold another Beast coming up out of the Earth this one not out of the sea out of the earth and he had two horns religious and political like a lamb and he spoke as the dragon and there's where brother brandham says a America is that Beast cuz she is the only Kingdom that comes out of the earth not a population of people in Europe but the new world like they call it then so that's why we read that scripture because brother brandham referred to it and showed us what Revelations 13 is now I want to make it pretty clear don't go and say I said is the end of the world like some said about September 2023 said that I said the world is coming to an end and um but I vividly said on the 70th Jubilee it's God's desire time to come as we worked out the Jubilee the 70th Jubilee which no one in this message knew or understood um understood it we made it plain because we got it in Gabriel 70 weeks we brother B said the 70th Jubilee the Rapture goes so we went to check up the 70th jub and we bought books from all over what we can get and uh we brought you the times and how it worked out and it worked out right onto uh 2024 September will be the 50th Jubilee from 1974 when the 70th Jubilee started and brother Brian spoke of 1977 which we also clarified 1977 and we had the privilege to shut a lot of people's mouths we thank God for these um Revelations that we could prove by the Bible by the message and also by the history about the 70th weeks of Daniel so that is God's desired time to come and we also said when it comes to God's desired time he has the right to lengthen the time or shorten the time you know because as it was in the days of Noah when God waited listen waited waited in his judgment to judge Noah's day in his longsuffering so if God has a longsuffering then we could say that he that is all in his hand but his wish is to come in the 70th Jubilee which we worked it out and showed you 6,000 years is up exactly like six days God created the Heaven and the Earth so um it is no prophecy of mine but also it's a signs of the end time still a time period it must be scriptural and it must be in the quotes and it must be time and it must be God's season then it will happen that's a quote we know Proverbs says there is a time and a season time and a season for every purpose of God a time and a season so could we venture out and say could this Perhaps Perhaps be God's time and season for the sixth Vision to be fulfilled from that time brother Bram says 1960 the 7 month 16th day he says thus saith the Lord in other words God said it not brother Brenham God said it there'll be a woman rule a woman rule before the end time listen here before the end time she'll either be president or vice president or the Roman Catholic Church listen there's three important points in this quote Point number one before the end time why does he say before the end time because the seventh vision is the end time the abor the seventh trumpet Revelations 11:14 the Third Woe cometh quickly it comes quickly after her that's the end remember that so her coming in is not the end of the world get me straight please but the bride is gone then when this happens when the bomb Falls when that woe comes remember the bride is gone before the end of the world in other words she won't see the end of the world the world so brother BR says a woman will rise she'll be he says she'll be president of Vice President well she's running for both she already fulfilled the one she is and was the vice president and now she's running to be a camp candidate for presidency so the quote is running with God's will so far we're going to bring this back again to you her eyes was 1990 Deputy district attorney 2000 courtroom prosecutor San Francisco two uh3 district attorney 2010 generalist attorney 2016 US senator 2020 elected vice president 2024 president candidate isn't this scary straight with the quote anybody can see this could it be El Tabernacle could it be so the court is running with God's will so far from the same quote from that time he says or the Catholic church so here we see distinctly two woman a natural woman that will be voted in and a spiritual woman which is the Roman Catholic Church that's not voted in she just comes in but the natural woman that will be president she gets voted in so I never saw this just the other day and as I went through the quotes and I think there's about 200 or so many quotes or even more uh and or if you read really those quotes you'll see he speaks every time of two wom that's why we have two candidates for the two woman one is Trump and the other one is Camila one will be Camila that is voted in so far we see how votes went the other one might be Trump that will let the Roman Catholic Church come in because of the pressure of the Roman Catholic church because America owes her trillions of dollars they can't even pay back the interest so will she put the screws on Trump if he gets elected and he will give in then to her and afterwards speak as the dragon it's to two scenarios here because the Roman Catholic Church when he says the Roman Catholic Church he says I got it in Brackets and you know what that mean I don't have to take you to school so um he says all the Catholic Church to human then he concludes the quote by saying thus saith the Lord so if it must come to pass is this the season for it you might have to check that thing out then in condemnation by representation then I seen a great woman rise up in the USA well dressed beautiful but cruel in heart she will either guide or lead this nation to ruination I got in parenthesis perhaps the Roman Catholic Church the second woman is well dressed and beautiful not the first one now we all were under the delusion that that woman that will come in the first one will be well-dressed and beautiful and many people will turn back and say well we don't think it's Camila because she's not so beautiful but he didn't put the emphasis on kamila the first woman he says the second woman the Roman Catholic Church is well dressed and cruel and beautiful now she's so beautiful that the Bible says when John saw her he marveled so beautiful the Roman Catholic Church is we're just eitting the Bible you know we just want you to see the Bible how brother Brandon put things down and he leaves it there for you to go check it up in the Bible so there's the Bible for it she's a beautiful woman he doesn't say that the first woman is pretty the second one then after that he seen USA lay in ashes after this woman comes in by votes or by force through maybe Trump he's the most uh eligible guy to let her come in because his name is Trump does he have the trump card to let it come in I'm just asking so um she will come in at the sixth the end of the sixth vision and then he says then after that he seen USA lay in ashes which is the seventh Vision the atomic bomb when it come to the end he says when it come to the end then he turns around and says it was the end so the seven vision is the end of the Earth and there's ases men mention here which is the atomic bomb so that why he says that's the beginning of it so he says the seven Vision ashes the USA uh is the end but the bride at this time is gone he said before the first eight bomb Falls we'll be in glory so we won't even see the end of the Earth that's why I said it you know we are not here when that seven Vision hit um as I said that pressure will be put on her now how is she coming in big question saw it in 1933 he saw it in 1933 how she will come in Ephesians Church age 196 and the woman being permitted to vote would help to elect the wrong person for this nation that would be the beginning we got back to human again now the woman's vote in America will swing the president don't see her way if they W vote for her because there's more woman voters than men voters there is more human voters in the states than men and right now the poll says the woman of the USA favor Camila Harris she pushes for abortion rights for women and woman can do with their bodies what they want the government can't tell a woman what to do with their bodies this is what woman is waiting for and Camila is a woman that said she will give it to them she'll sign it in to law will she come in with a woman vote it pretty much look like it so we have it right in front of us it closes with this it might be the beginning that quotation it might be the beginning of what what beginning of the seventh Vision the end of the world the human vote is the beginning of the end now five of the seven Visions came to pass the first V the second W 41 ashes atomic bomb is passed at this time with a second world war this now lays in the history books it's out of the Bible into the history books the message why seven things I saw five of them as of already come to pass what's left of the seven Visions the sixth vision and then which is woman president six vision and then the seventh the very very end the uh atomic bomb to follow the six Vision that's the end so Camila's election will be the beginning of the the end so it's obvious now remember let me let me bring this in is the beginning of the end but before the end comes the Rapture takes place get that straight so it's obvious we seeing the sixth one unfolding I say it very much look like it if if if it is then lift up your heads your Redemption of your body is n it's the beginning of the seven vision and the end of the six is that fair comment I think it is fair commence because brother Brenham says in desperation that the newspapers preaches much louder than the ministers and I want to say the ministers in this message because Pentecost is long gone denomination brother B says there's nothing wrong in probing in C is this the time and I probe and this is what I come up with we'll found find out in a few days time now I just want to give you this quote ludian Church age 1960 the nation is a woman's Nation the flag was made by a woman it's number 13 a human now this is a quote it started out 13 stars and 13 stripes woman 13 colonies woman both woman 13 stars on a silver dollar woman appears in Revelations 13 woman everything is human human human human human right on down they already worship a woman anyhow a woman's picture on the money end of quote and I want to add to all that the Statue of Liberty welcomes you into USA which is a woman right in the quotation this is the situation now in the States you can't deny it especially in the message this is scario this is what the ancient culture says the number 13 is represented as feminine which is woman straight with brother brenham's called as the ancient culture says why because it responded to the number of lunar menstral circles in a year 13 * 28 equal 364 days the theory is that as the solar calendar triumphed over the lunan the number 13 becomes anema there's two meanings to anema it means one excommunication by a church two person that's curs or condemned by God the seventh Vision she's condemned by God Los Angeles condemned by God Yellowstone condemned by God abam Seven Vision condemned by God a Prophet prophesying this condemned by God through thus saith the Lord oh my God nature tells you it is so Bible tells you it is so the prophet tells you it is so now the dictionary tells you so as Luke 17:26 says you'll hear it again we're going to play it again for you as it was in the days of Noah hum then Genesis uh Sodom and gomorra Lot's wife remember her Genesis 19 wife again a woman both Noah's day Noah's Genesis 6 Daughters of men became Fair became pretty human and lot's day Sodom Genesis 19 Lot's wife and Jesus tells us in this age remember Lot's wife woman both the end came with woman so shall it be in our day are we seeing the scripture being fulfilled I ask you El Tabernacle check it up I cannot see it any other way but we have to mention it to keep you alert you know so that you know to lift up your head and be already and Virgil and when the time comes she has invaded every space in the world today she's on motor cars all the blackards and all that you know a woman will rise and become president is God going to keep his word that's what he says in that message she choose a partner for vice president and look at this how can we miss it Tim Walls the sure is modern events made clear by prophecy is it prophecy made clear by modern events I looked I like this one I just swapped that title around of brother Brenan and said prophecy this is the prophecy Revelations 13 is the prophecy woman's vote is the prophecy made clear by modern events I like like this one for my day not a one that Revelations 10:8 says prophesy again this is all in the prophesy again do it again and then we have the picture of Biden Statue of Liberty Moon and Kema heris now sit back and listen to the clip thank you the United States of America a woman's Nation comments by the Apostle Edgar Hill Rosco Joe Biden his name means associated with woman he chose a woman as vice president he resigned from the 2024 presidential race on the 21th July 2024 a Blood Moon Over the Statue of Liberty the same night Joe Biden resigns from the presidential race the moon represents a woman the Statue of Liberty representing a woman the next day the endorsement of a woman as candidate for US president Camala Harris [Music] Revelation 13 a woman the United States of America now you don't have to be super spiritual to see this to see what God wants us to see the whole thing is women and now there is 10 women for one man Genesis 6:1 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth and daughters were born unto them not men was born unto them daughters but daughters were born unto them men so it's fulfilled the daughters were Fair they're pretty even take the black women they're pretty a sign that it is finish can you read this look at this chart and still believe it's not the end Genesis 6:2 and they took them WI of all which they chose then and they took unto themselves wives they don't marry them she just shifts or moves in with you this was Noah's day then the scripture says in Luke the 17:26 and as it was in the days of Noah woman so shall it be also in the days of the son of man Genesis 18:9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife a woman Genesis 18:26 but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt Lot's wife woman again we need to remember Lot's wife Luke 17: 29-32 but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the the son of man is revealed remember Lot's wife lot's day then the end comes when women is displaying themselves now church can you see this pattern being displayed in front of you a sign of the end in there homosexuality at the Olympics openly displayed in a mock show piece that mocks the last supper after they had that the pale horse rider ran out through the water you had to see it the devil made legit then the last thing is the message can't see this clearly she is a woman's Nation she stood in the Forefront in this debate she invaded every space in the world and I predict that a woman will be a great woman you younger people here tonight remember brother Brandon has said this and I said it in 33 when I saw the coming of the Lord and how the automobiles are continually shape up like an age until finally they would come into a perfect age shape maybe part of the Year NOS written on Old papers and things and I seen a woman rid vulgar as she was and dominated the country and I predict that a woman will either be president or do or come into great power of some sort in the United States before the total anation of the world keep that in mind and I have said it the title God keeps his word let's see if God keeps his word now many of you know before I was elected vice president or elected a United State Senator I was an elected attorney general and before that elected district attorney and before that I was a courtroom prosecutor the rise of camela Harris she came from being a courtroom prosecutor San Francisco City Hall then a district attorney San Francisco California then Attorney General of California then a United States Senator then Vice President of the United States now she is running for president of the United States of America look how she Rises up exactly like the quote says Tuesday 6th of August 2024 she chose her partner for vice president she didn't choose a woman to partner her she chose a man ironically she chooses a partner by the name of Tim Waltz Waltz is a dance with a musical beat quite difficult to master what does it mean what does this entail and what is God trying to tell us this is what Waltz means Waltz a dance in triple time performed by a couple Who as a pair turn rhythmically around and around as they progress around the Dance Floor dance a waltz I waltzed across the floor with the left tenant move or act lightly casually or inconsiderately you can't just Walt in here and bark orders at me what does it mean to waltz with someone a formal dance in which two people holding each other move around a large room

behind the Walts danced with a step slide and step in three different a Time the Walts appeared to represent the new era's ideals of Freedom character passion and expressiveness it was brought to the

wh music in 3/4 time box step vien Walts dance in 34 time dance March music and zip will they dance into the presidency of the United States fulfilling the sixth Vision presidency prophecy is modern events made clear by prophecy prophecy will make modern events clear it's clear to us that love this message if she becomes the president it is the end not the very end there's still a time will the devil enter her and the pope Revelation 13 and Revelation 17 then we have the seventh Vision the atomic bomb the third world war the annihilation of America and the world the end of the world we don't know what and where the Middle East is boiling the Ukraine and Russian war is escalating the Uproar in Many Nations is causing concern in Africa it's worrying it's tightening towards the seventh Vision can you see why she has to come in first to open the seventh Vision by her coming in I believe this Revelation 7 will happen afterwards WS after what the six seals Revelation 6 the sixth trumpet Revelation 7 verse1 and after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree Four Winds War worldwide atomic bomb that's why they can't throw the atomic bomb Revelation 7:2 must happen after this Revelation 7:2 and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the Sea atomic bomb Revelation 7:3 saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the tree till we have sealed the Servants of our God in their foreheads which is the 144,000 Jews now notice at the closing of this these Jews returning saying they were looking for the Messiah to come a great Spiritual Awakening to come in immediately after coming out of the here going right into Israel where there's never been any fanaticism or carrying on or anything right into Virgin Territory and I believe if there will be Awakening of the old Jews for about a million or two to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ will come on the scene as certain as anything there's your quote so the Holy Ghost will be taken away from the Gentiles this is the Camala Harris that makes me worried [Music] you can probe into this to find out if it is so because it's history and may God keep us true until the breakup day amen [Music] Our [Music] Father which are in heaven [Music] be th name thy kingom come thy will be the on on Earth as it is in heav [Music] give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our Deb as we forgive our de and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the king go and the power and the glory for [Music] [Music] for th

us as there's a lot of question marks around the world right now about this episode that is transpired question marks doubt and even people leaving the message but I thank you great one for for this [Applause] place where you can give us understanding and knowledge to handle whatever comes our way I pray that you died me behind the Cross pray that you would open minds I pray that you would concrete [Applause] Faith what we believe I ask it in your blessed name amen amen now I'm just going to testify tonight I'm not here to preach if I do forgive me but I'd like to just lay down a testimony and um as things are boiling outside there of what has happened I would lay down my testimony and then afterwards try and go into uh the problematic thing that's hindering people so my testimony on Billy Paul [Applause] Brenham he was the first one to call me his friend so brother Rosco you are my friend and tonight I'd like to speak about my [Applause] friend when I found uh brother Keith in Cape Town we came back and I wanted to know how things are and then the first words that he uted to me was U do you know how that man loved you I said yes kid I know he said but but do you really know in other words I said yes I know cuz he wrote to me and uh I felt it on my heart seeing those question marks or just to go through some things I I've been around him and then uh the main thing is he's death now and those angels are still standing how do you get around it amen so you may be be seated I'm not going to look for amens or nothing I'm just testifying okay I also have a testimony so uh Daniel gave me a scripture which I would like to read um proverbs 10:7 the memory of the just is blessed am the memory of the just is blessed and I would include right in there I remember Bly Paul in a happy way cuz his memories that I carry is surely blessed I believe that some people was asking isn't brother rosar going to say something about Billy Paul they wanted to know if I'm going to say something about brother luck and I didn't because I didn't feel for it I didn't feel like wasting time it's a waste of time but but I feel to say something about Billy Paul you may be [Applause] seated his name carries two Church Church age Messengers combined in [Applause] one Bly is the name for William am if your name is William in the states they call you bu amen so his name is Bully which means brother brand the last Church age messenger and Paul the first church H [Applause] messeng so brother Brena took the two names and splice it together and called him the first and the last Messengers names his mother's name was hope that was his first Union and she died when she was very very very young and brother Bram tells you how he had to carry bully all over and keep the bottle here in his to keep it warm for Bully to drink so bully was without a mother since a young young age and Sarah Rose also died Bully's only sister died at the same time sister hope died and brother brandham didn't want to marry again and the angel of the Lord told him because of the days are so bad that um woman has gone on the Rampage he says You must get married and while God was speaking to him God was speaking to his second wife and he told his second wife behold I'll send you [Applause] [Music] Elijah and one day brother brandham got bully and he said you know bully you had a queen of a mother hope she was a queen she was just something extraordinary she was not maybe a woman she was a lady and all that she wanted to see is success for a husband brother brandham and I think that's why bully was so over brother brandham you can't say anything negative in Bully's presence about his father he was the best friend to his dad and I I always admired that by him what Dad said is yeah and amen settles [Applause] it and Bully couldn't preach because of the marriage and divorce case he had and I watched him all the years he would never go in and go PR because Dad said so he always said I'm a testimony he always said I'm I'm carrying the biscuits to the Brethren brother brandham baked the biscuits but he said he took the biscuits to give it to the brethren so those are the things that I hold dear about bullying and I had the privilege for being in his company quite a few times I do not think there's a South African guy or Minister that had the Privileges I had and therefore I was so rugged in what I believe that they couldn't change my mind at all I know where I am called [Applause] in and um I will always be grateful to God that I had those privileges with brother bully the first time I met him was in 1977 he took me around Jeff took me to the Ohio River his father baptized the 17th person it took me to Spring Street and um he took me to eat at the restaurant brother Bram used to like to go to he took me to the shop where brother BR used to buy that sweets that strong sweets and he bought me a packet he took me to the grave of brother brandham I wouldn't say what happened there he took me to his mother's um grave sister hope he took me to the tour through the church brandham Tabernacle Church because the evening I testified in the church there that's when that guy walked up and told me for all these years we only felt the same anointing that was upon brother Brandon that was on you that was the time and then you know what he gave he gave me and um then he showed me The Minister's room where brother Brandon first went in before he went into the pulpit and in The Minister's room he told me he said uh uh brother Edgar you see this Photograph I said yes I see the photograph he says to me um that photo brother Coleman gave brother brandham and when I looked at the photo God bless you brother when I looked at the photo I saw it was Elijah leaving and brother Brenham hanged it right in he studied there before going into the pit and then without Ado I told Brother Coleman I saw them photograph that you sent brother uh the prophet and then brother Coleman gave me the testimony of the photo somebody drew it painted it and uh and he told me who gave it to him when he received it and looked at it the inspiration of God fell on him brother Coleman and told the inspiration told Brother Coleman wrap it up and send it to my prophet and brother Coleman took the photo wrapped it up and sent it to brother Brenham and without Ado brother Ram took the photo and hanged it in that room it's still there today and um it wasn't long then Elijah did leave and I remember brother K said when when brother random died he walked into the pulit that morning and preach on the shout of the king is in the camp so don't be dismayed the messenger is gone but the shout of the king is in the [Applause] C so many will see that photo but they wouldn't know the history behind it the next meeting with Billy Paul was in Oklahoma after the meetings that I preach we had a lunch together Billy Paul his wife brother Coleman sister Elaine Musgrove his wife and me and my wife we sat at one table and at together and U after we finish at brother bik Paul remain seated and everybody left and me and my wife got up and I said bu I have to go over to the French people there because I was flying to Paris from New York and um bu he kept on sitting I spoke to the guys from France me my wife and as we came back I had to pass B Paul cuz he was still sitting and he had some papers or whatever it is in his hand and you know and when I came close to him he jumped in front of me and my wife and he said um brother Rosco I need to tell you something and I was shocked now keman told me a few things about bully which I already picked up there I knew what it what's coming but I I was praying that it was something good and not some little devil hiding somewhere that he's going to pull out you understand how it is is when you come into the into the presence of a man of God you always have question marks hey uh he mustn't see you know my ugly [Applause] side we all have ugly sides and he told me he says brother Rosco I just want to tell you that um since I saw the angel of the Lord I said oh oh he says since I saw the angel of the Lord he left me with a gift to discern ministers I said okay so I will really know who I am and then he said brother Ros I have discerned you and I want to tell you that you have one of the best Spirits among all the ministers I ever met in this [Applause] message me and my wife's knees buckled and we said we're going to keep that one for the Millennium that me and my wife is going to talk it over how he felt when he said [Applause] that and he just said that and and and and and he left me and he walked out and uh we were really shocked when my wife we stood stood there and uh we walked out and right in the corner there brother Coleman was standing and when we started to walk out brother Coleman ran over and he says come on brother Rosco come on what did bully tell you I said um yeah you did he said I know I I was watching the whole thing when he had his stuff there and he was sitting there I knew he was Discerning one of us and he discerned you and then I gave brother colan the story but I thought it's going to end right there but it didn't end there him and um Joseph came to South Africa and they asked me to take them around so when he came to South Africa I picked them up with um Theo Erasmus and then he said brother Rosco I want to go to the hotel where I saw the angel now look how he hooks the thing up he waited I took him to the hotel he says that angel just stood here and he went through it you know the story and uh he said do you know why he said wake up your son to see me and not no no no these young pastors know nothing man must come to the Elder the Elder will tell them and he said you know why brother Rosco I said no he says on our way down to Cape Town just before CS door there was popular trees there they cut it off now just before you get into clar do brother Bram told him to stop the car and he got out and he went over to that popular of trees and he plucked off the branches and he threw the branches in front of them on their feet and he says thus sayeth the Lord I'm not supposed to go he was not supposed to go to Cape Town he was not supposed to go to csor that's why we never built a church in clor but in porch and um then you know what he said What The Minister's done wake up that brother there right next to you yeah yeah you slap like there and um he says and I told my dad I says Dad can I tell you something he says yes he says let's book our tickets back why should we listen to these ministers let's listen to God and let's go [Applause] back don't listen to this Minister's day he says and when they came back to jobber the why of the matter why he and not his brother was woken up to see the angel was because bully said let us not listen to the ministers don't listen to a minister that don't have the Holy [Applause] Ghost and he said dad told me that that pleased the angel so that I could see that angel brother osar he stood right here and he went right through the window gone and you know he described the angel exactly dark [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] skin and you hooked Oklahoma up with Joe to make sure that I understood What's Happening Now how could I listen to these past yeah want to tell me something I don't care about that I heard straight from the angel of the Lord and straight from Brother brandham when you laid hands on my head I don't listen to No Minister you're not on my level and I will never listen to [Applause] you what a testimony that [Applause] is if you look deep into this story here what he says since the angel left him he got discernment so I look deep into the thing I feel that the angel told him sit there and tell him who he is how else could it be and he sat and he waited for me and told me who I am if you have the right Spirit you have the right word I would rather be right in my spirit and wrong in my Doctrine and here's Al Tabernacle why because the blessing is on [Applause] somebody now how could guy a guy a simple black guy like this African boy have a blessing from a prophet and a prophet son that saw the [Applause] angel tell me which which black guy up Africa way can have a testimony like this [Applause] n okay that's why I can't listen to anybody brother Brown says this boy will preach exactly what I preach Billy PA said this boy has got a nicer Spirit among the Ministries he'll preach exactly the word mechanics buly comes he says you have the best Spirit Dynamics Dynamics mechanics together is that my [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Ministry then then to you El Tabernacle look I'm responsible for you I'm not responsible for anybody else you pay me your ti [Music] so I need to look after [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you so I carry a heavy testimony and I can't come down that's why I'm so robust [Applause] on another meeting in Oklahoma I was cautioned by the Holy Ghost there's a trap set for me I stayed in a hotel room just went down into the now by the way the the the the hotel that brother R stayed in here they broke it down was an old old hotel and I'm so glad that it was still standing when bll and them came and I could take them there you know um the meeting was tight in Oklahoma it was stuff and Coin and I'm didn't know what to do many of times uh in Forest Hill brother K's church when I come then there is nothing I sat in a in a in a in a Minister's room and K will tell me just go up and talk and leave that people don't want to serve God and then uh Joey bomo will come down and said brother Rosco you're not going to get these people right and then I said I just thought well we'll see and then I went up and I think within 15 minutes the church was mixed up it's going on [Music] this and you you heard the statement brother Coleman said he said brother Rosco you can put brother Rosco in the middle of a graveyard you heard him say that so after he preached the dead will raise up and clap their [Applause] hands now again the the the the convention was really tight and dry and um Bly and them was there with his son and uh I went in and uh I commended and thank bully and said bully we're really glad for you and your family and many of days you were without the father so that your father can fathered us so many a days you didn't have somebody to guide you CU you W home but you were busy guiding this bride I said bully many a days you might have weeped and cried for dad while your dad was preaching to us and we were weeping and crying in front of God I said [Applause] bully today because of your dad I can live of tithes that your dad's labors brought to me I'm not worthy it's your father's tithes that I'm living on so I'm living actually of your money Bly and buly and them was crying and I started to preach and the deacons were standing you know how K posted these Deacons and uh when I was about a half an hour in I looked around and the deacons was crying standing and the tears was running all of [Applause] them all of them I then left the poopit I went up because I needed to change and uh I ran down because I wanted to speak to norga from Tucson and just before he pulled away Coleman was standing there say Isaac save Journey my brother he says yeah he says brother keman I just want to tell you something and brother keman says what he said you know where to put this guy where to preach when your meetings is dying then you know there's a Rosco that can pick it [Music] up what a [Applause] testimony and then when I went back I just see somebody jump into the lift and says brother Rosco there was a trap set for you here because I had a dream that you were going to bomb this place to pieces I had a dream but I must tell you it was from the devil because it was just the opposite and they still don't know that I know but that's when you got the Holy Ghost he [Applause] Wars then I heard bully tell somebody that you know today well brother OS was preaching my son received the Holy [Applause] Ghost the other time I preached and met bully was when I preached on identification and this message is on tape uh you know the message and after I preach as usual the Holy Ghost filled the house you can hear Brother Coleman tell brother bully bully isn't this it's right on tape isn't this the same anointing that was with your father buly rais his hand up and he [Applause] says I remember buly in a happy [Applause] [Music] [Applause] way after the meeting bully met me before we went in for lunch and he said to me brother Rosco you brought it [Applause] [Music] I remember bully in a happy [Applause] way and after this meeting was when he sent me the letter and they stole the letter in Zimbabwe with my Bible funny they didn't steal anything else in the car I had a Bible like this my name printed on and the letter was in there and I just took the Bible with the letter when they broke into the car but I ready to the church I ready to the elders I ready to the Deacons and the Rasmus read the letter and uh in the letter he asked me to send him the cloud picture with hopman's head in [Applause] Christ and then he said brother Ros will you be so kind and S Joseph one too so in other words send us two one for Joseph one for me and I send it off to them the next thing in the letter was he called me Edgar my friend I'm glad I have friends I don't have to go make friends I don't need friends I the best of the [Applause] best as a friend and in the letter he says you know but he told me this after the meeting too he says I just like to listen to you but in the letter he said I only listen to you and my dad no other [Applause] minister yes I remember bully in a happy way [Applause] the Rasmus read the letter and he gave the letter back to me he says now can I add to that letter I says yeah well add brother Theo he says I would put them down there the greatest charismatic preacher in the message and that the message ever saw is you brother rosar not F Edgar [Applause] OS now we're coming to the close here a buly Paul died and as I said there such a lot of things going on lot of people talking a lot of people criticizing a lot of people ready to leave the message again the churches has gone small as I told you on sister Sunday Monday was it Monday Monday it's going to be worse now but elter I want to tell you that you have a man of God in a poop [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] w [Applause] I ain't going [Applause] [Music] nowhere [Applause] brother bully died remember to be spiritual now I'm asking you to be spiritual now just a little thing can throw you out and offboard amen and make you believe some fault things just a little thing that's overlooked in the scripture can throw you way back in the world therefore a pastor must be very sensitive to the word of God now this thing of bully Paul in Los Angeles a small thing in that quote can make you give up deny the message reject the message reject brother brandham and yet brother brandham says sometimes things got to be said so that some may flock away exactly but El Tabernacle you're not going to flock away I am standing right there I will stop you from fing [Applause] away just a little thing that you miss in the scriptures will make you backslide or leave the message so your leader must be very spiritual because God is pruned to hide things he likes to do it he likes to do things to make you like [Music] [Applause] this one time brother Brandon was waiting for a vision to get fulfilled and he waited and he know everything was settled everything was said there and uh he was wondering now what what is wrong that thing had to break and you know what was wrong a hat was not on the on the right place a hat so a hat so perfect is your God how can we ever be [Applause] God little thing small thing ahead everything must be lined up then God moves why because the Song of Solomon Chapter 2:1 15 says it's the little foxes that spoils the vine that little intri that make you miss [Applause] God so here is a little thing that causing the stumbling block and people wanting to leave the message and as I said I'm responsible for El Tabernacle only I'm going to give an account of this what I see amen now watch be alert with every problem in this message 20 some OD years ago I found the answer to every problem that's why we could never go wrong and I'm going to tell you the [Applause] problem you want to know the problem you did hear it before but in the light that it is now you'll know it even the better amen okay let's go to 1963 721 he cares do you listen to the message he cares do you care it was on Luther King brother Braham says he's going to lead thousands of people to their death and it didn't happen and this guy wrote to brother brandham says did you prophesy because Martin Luther King just died and this is what brother brandham had to say have we got it brother listen to what he says he says now see listen listen to this now see I've always asked you to be careful little things be careful amen what you're listening to see that's Point number one he is educating the bride now to be careful what are you listening to have you got that point let's go on with that quote point two not everything is thus sayth the Lord that I say so brother brandham when he speak is not everything is thus sayth the Lord amen oh my when brother BR say throw that ball is that that say the Lord not everything he said now I didn't say it brother brandham said it and if brother Brenham said it that you have to be careful then you have to check whether the thing is thus sayith the Lord hallelujah Glory Hallelujah so before you run is it God speaking or is it William brenham's Human Side speaking brother Brenham goes on I'm going to show you further he says there's many things in the spoken word That's The Human Side not the prophetic side [Applause] so when you read the scripture and the quotes you must make sure that it is thus sayeth the Lord and not brother bram's Human Side amen am that answers all the [Applause] [Music] questions now listen what he says Point number three for everything in the message that goes forth this is what you have to do what read it for me are they doing it brother Bram speak like a human being and not thus say the Lord then they want to say listen brother Brenham is a human being not everything he spoke was thus say the Lord so he says watch when I say that say of the [Applause] Lord oh my my my my my my my my [Applause] my [Applause] he goes further point 4 five it's not me it's him if it's me it will fail but if it's him it can't fail if it's William brandham that said it and not thus sayth the Lord it will fail so now you got two streams to watch as you read the spoken word is it thus say the Lord or is it brother brandham [Applause] [Music] saying can I have a witness [Applause] [Music] [Applause] here now let's go to the next one listen to what he says and I can't say it until he tells me I could be altogether wrong in my thought about Martin Luther King and he was wrong because it was not thus sayeth the Lord how you going to rock edar Osco I have Bible and word Hallelujah I am not an ordinary Minister I am [Music] [Applause] special Point number six this is me speaking it's my opinion so I was wrong that was just the human side and not the thus sayeth the Lord that's why it didn't come to pass I want to ask you elter vano can you see where I'm going to [Applause] when he speaks it's thus sayth the Lord now I have dissected the quote from bully Paul I was in this meeting will he play the clip reach back a new shock of hair said just once more I believe that's the hour that we're living I believe that with all of us I believe that God making his final move going home if you want a little s to look at you need a little sign look at this old man he said I won't be an old sharks will be swimming where you're standing get close you seated now I want you to be honest with edar Rosco did he say th say of the Lord it says thus say the Lord bully you will not be an old man so n it is not th sayth the Lord it is brother bram's opinion in a private interview with his son it is not in the spoken word nowhere because the spoken word is for the bride so that was not for us that was for Billy Paul Point number [Applause] two point number three he spoke many of things to Brothers personally he told Brother R you'll be a preacher that's not in a spoken word and Ashley Campbell told Brother brand brother buly I was there he did tell you that but he never say you're fful Minister and bang Dev R gos he told bcll some things about a woman that Bisal told me personal you won't find it in the spook word he told home how many things about Bishop Johnson and what have you personal it's not in the spoken word so it's got nothing to do with a [Applause] bride so that is in two parts there it's in two parts the one part was human speaking to Billy Paul and not thus say the Lord the other part of the Sharks will swim is thus sayth the Lord that's going to [Applause] happen now why is it thus say the Lord is because of Los Angeles choosing of a bride am when brother brandham came to the pit Ed Hunter told me he said brother Rosco it was bad you know when brother Brown spoke about that cow how she looks and that's how some woman looks he said don't marry a woman like that that's got that cow look he says and the Pentecost was laughing and joking he says all of a sudden the atmosphere switched and it was like angel's wings coming into the church and then brother brandham got up he said thus sayeth the Lord Los Angeles Los Angeles one day you'll find yourself beneath the ocean that's thus sayth the Lord the Shark part is thus sayith the Lord but the Bully part is not thus sayith the Lord it is also not on the tapes it is also not in the [Applause] books are you clear on it so why was we worry we worry about that say of the [Applause] Lord and you know how this happened brother BR and prophesied and said thus say the Lord sister shakarian demon sharan's sister you shall die and in the same meeting a guy got up and spoke in tongues well Paul said he had Go's flesh and he was worried and the interpretation was my daughter you won't die you will love and Bully was worried brother Benham looked at him and said buly what's wrong said no nothing there he said no no no you you worried about the tongues he says yes yes Dad that was really nail biting Goose flesh stuff you could feel it brother said to him buly all did I say the same angel that told me sharks will swarm told me she's going to die then he added his own opinion he says you might not even get an old man so that was not thus sayith the Lord the Sharks was thus sayith the Lord and then two weeks after that Deus zakarian's sister died so if she died Los Angel because it's the same angel that says she's going to die said Los Angeles is going to sink it's going to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sink now can you see what God does to throw people off he makes brother Brenham say give his opinion and not thus sayth the Lord but we have a quote where brother Bram says you better listen to thus sayeth the Lord am I don't like this amen yet there's a little doubt in this [Applause] same no the cracking thing is when did Bully die what is October is October the 70th Jubilee we're going into the last part of the 70th Jubilee what's the 70th of 70th Jubilee it's Los Angeles going down because there must be an earthquake to open the graves and brother Bram takes Bly Paul and hook it up with a 70th Jubilee and he died in the time of the 70th [Applause] Jubilee [Applause] what is Jubilee going home going into eternity right am I right how old was bully what is eight [Applause] City come on man come on [Applause] amen we're going home in the midnight tree don't you want to go with me God is telling you it's time for Los Angeles to go down that's why I connected Billy's name with Los Angeles IST and how do you know the scientist says in 5 minutes or in 5 years those angels must be below the [Applause] sea Amen brother [Applause] Joel now how can I leave the message when I have the the answer to this question have you got to answer now tonight can't hear [Applause] you [Applause] no as it is above so it is below when Jesus was born it was above three stars came together and so it was below now what happened could we have it some of the US got the to see the Ring of eclipse Saturday October the 14th it showed in the heaven that the great man of God is going home few days after that but he said goodbye but it was showed in the heaven in the United States now you want to tell me this is coincidence it's not

and um I'll just like to um have you listen to this uh testimony and uh I will say something after it it explain um I never even spoke to the family about this type my the first time they will hear about it uh the other thing is this um uh I don't even think brother Raymond remembered this tape it's the tape that we took out of the archives there a lot of tapes in our archives and uh but uh it is um it's encouragement praise God you may be seated at the time a certain lady one [Music] time she wrote a letter to Sister Brandon she said sister bam I want to thank you for your husband says I was in a nervous condition I was taking about 24 PS a day to car my nerves to cool me down and nothing would help since it went on for weeks days months years says but praise God I'm writing this letter of appreciation says because your husband was willing to go to forsake his family forsake his children he was prepared to lay himself and stand in the Gap says he was many miles away from your home he was in our country the doctors had given up hope there was nothing they could do for me but your husband came into the country God sent you there so there I was without hope my children was rued my house was rued say but because someone was willing to go so that night I came into the meeting he called my name he told me what was wrong with me I told you not to worry sister it's all over it say ever since that day I'm a perfect Norm person sister Bram I want to tell you these words it would never have happened if your husband wasn't willing to lay all on the Altar and I believe there's many yet tonight that feels the same way about our precious Pastor I know there's many sitting here tonight who you know through his ministry you've been set free God came into your life God did something praise God [Music] hallelujah praise God when your marriage was ready to break up and in the phone call in the middle of the night he came and set for hours and spoke and brought the two together who was it my brother praise God when that seems there was no God had a man God had a man [Music] amen praise God brother say God once God called man man that's not afraid of the fire of God and this church here tonight is the most you hear what I'm saying you we going to be the most responsible people before almighty God for what God has placed in our life tonight we're going to be the most responsible people tonight in the whole of the world tonight friends praise God oh when it seems like oh Hope Was Gone someone came driving up your driveway and knocked on your door and came and spoke and says brother you're doing the whole thing why someone was willing to go I think it said our brother Bram one time he came home and his own own child didn't even know him when he knocked on the door I think the daughter says the little baby says mommy he has some man at the door and it was his own father praise God what can we say words fail us tonight I'm a witness I like to give Witness what happened in Cape Town as we drove down to brother Layman's funeral tired and we as we got there and there are so many ministers and they gave each Minister a chance to say something there was all the Pentecostal ministers each of them got up and identified themselves and gave all the titles and who they were and what the churches was under them as he went from minister to minister eventually came to the ministers in the message and there were all the ministers and they got up and each one said each thing but there was just no fear some ministers got up and said some nasty things and Tred to stick the pastor I said there since God I've seen you anointing so many times Lord I've seen God with the seems like the the other was against him I see you anointing him Lord and it came to the time where the pastor had to speak brother I never seen something like that in all my life each M had 10 minutes to speak and the pastor came and he ripped out the mic and he says praise God he says Pastor OS he says I come from Jesus Christ praise God it says I got no church but his church and brother when he spoke the anointing of God dropped on praise God in the face of the critics in the face of all the forers in the face of all the HS against him brother the power of God came down and anointed him and the glory of God was in the place in 10 minutes time in 10 minutes time the presence of God the Angels was walking up and down the aisle the glory of God was there praise God the dropped down in 10 minutes time Hallelujah I'm a witness I'm a witness I'm a witness tonight that the glory of God came down all over the building in 10 minutes [Applause] time oh my God I think I believe from tonight on we know it's the truth it's the first time the pastor spoke like he did tonight and I believe from tonight we we're going to pray more for him we believe as his body is tired and weary and the eggs begin to come in the body we're going to be like Moses when he got tired to lift up his hands in prayer and pray for him every morning you get up you remember the pastor's name every morning you get up you call upon his family's name you pray for them and say God give him new Strength God give him a new charge God restore Health God give him a new burst of faith and strength will you do that friends I believe the Bible says pray for them who watch over your souls pray for them pray for them who watches over your souls pray for them brother that watches over your Souls praise God my as apostle said all over there looking for a man to stand in a gap and you know what's going around you know what's happening all over the country the news is out people want some man like this friends people is looking for someone that can bring down the presence of God people is looking for someone that's got reality the world is sick of imitations the world is sick of brother sister Social Gospel but God wants a god call man a God man on the face of the Earth with the anointing of God upon Him Do You Believe don't you appreciate the pastor tonight don't you appreciate his wife tonight let's give the Lord a hand in Praise thank you Lord oh hallelujah thank you Jesus praise God oh Hallelujah words will fail us tonight to go through the things that has happened and transpired through all the years but we want to say we appreciate him tonight praise God want to tell him we appreciate him we're going to stand with him like never before praise God and uh the pastor wants us wants he uh to thank the deacons from his side he appreciate the deacons that have stood with him all the years he wants to say appreciate them praise God from my side I want to say I appreciate the elders the de consy praise God I want to put my appreciation in with the praise God and knowing that the hour is here brother praise God charity never faileth the brotherly kindness is here the honey is here what to stick us together like never before to love your brother with such a Godly love why because godliness is beginning to pour into the Church of God and what is God is a God man praise God to express brotherly kindness you're going to love your brother love your sister love one another and brother says let nothing come between you nothing praise God you refuse to let anything come in between you and your brother you and your sister and you watch brother and sister when that church becomes one and the Revelation becomes one among them like the day of Pentecost when they were in one Accord it says the power of almighty God will drop down and signs wonders and miracles we see it but you're going to see it in a bigger scale brother if we dedicate Our Lives to him don't you love him tonight don't you want to say Lord I Surrender tonight praise God let us stand to our feet praise God there's some uh quotes I wanted to read but praise God everything has been said what can you say brother after such a meeting what can you say to know that Mark 14 the Bible says she did she did everything she could do praise God and I believe we're going to do everything we can do from tonight on we're going to pray like never before we're going to be sincere we're going to do everything the Bible says he did everything she could do and that was to anoint her master and you have it in your power tonight to do everything I don't care what is on your job at home at school you do everything that you can for the master tonight and the Bible says that he was pleased with what he did and I believe God is pleased with what has been done in this church praise God As we sing I surrender all tonight your head bow your eye Clos Lord I surrender all tonight just before we go into the communion tonight Lord I want to surrender my life I want to dedicate it I want to anoint your head tonight God praise God lord I want to I want to anoint it God I want to break the alabaster box tonight God and let the anointing of God flow tonight Lord Jesus we can say like Paul says time fails us to tell about B and all the Great Men of old and I believe time would fail us tonight if we would say and speak about the things that God has done in the ministry of our precious Pastor time would fail us but we want to show more appreciation from our sides more respect praise good so um I was uh told by a young preacher some time ago um what did you all the guys left for us what Legacy did you leave for us and he mentioned U brother becket's name and my name especially and um he um then went on to say all that you guys has left us is fighting and jealousy and bad mouthing one another and you had unkind words all the time against one another and to him it seemed as if this message started that way and that is what we all the brothers has left behind and that made me play this tape because if you listen to this tape here's Raymond Thompson for instance we can play you a tape of Solen and what he says to and it wasn't all dark and Gloom and uh fighting and fussing and at the beginning when we started we were actually watching one another's back way back there we were one in spirit truth way back there so young man if you think that we started with what you call backbiting and fighting and being jealous of one another and had unkind words I played you this tape to show you that at the beginning there was no unkind words on this tape there's no unkind words words on this St there is no ugliness and that was way back there when we started and that's the way it was so I thought I'm going to play the tape um to show these young men or young preachers that has come in it wasn't all the time Doom and Gloom and and bad mouthing we used to have conventions and we all go went to the convention and will convention we were there when uh brother Layman down in Cape Town had conventions we were there when we had conventions out in de Gloria we were there and uh I will admit that afterwards uh things happened and maybe up till now we still have that animosity and fighting and uh because everyone went with with his little Doctrine you know uh we had the peruja doctrine with brother Billy and brother Harold Beckett and uh then we had uh brother Raymond and them and myself with a seventh underd Doctrine and all that but um then afterwards we found out the brother Brenham didn't see a thing like for instance um would say you receive the Holy Ghost without emotions and all that I wanted all the years is to see those words come out of brother brenham's mouth then I believe it but that's not a quote that's not what brother Bram says the same with the thund not so there's where the the the problem started and we started to break up and we had um our scages and uh people didn't greet one another and we don't visit one another's churches and uh because uh I think we got to a place where we were scared we going to lose members well I would say I thought that I wouldn't like to lose more members at that time but uh at before all these doctrines came we didn't have my brother all these fightings and stuff that you see so we left a legacy even our Legacy if I look at you then I ask myself how did you come in here you in the message what Legacy are you leaving have you done anything we were on fire for God we had Fellowship right through the night and uh you don't even have that anymore so uh we U we thought that we would um play this tape um so that you could um understand that when this message started we didn't have what we have today day uh we gave one another accolades like on the tap you heard brother Raymond giving out accolades he was we had conventions together and um we covered one another's backs we move freely to one another's churches if they were was other the churches and um even way back there with brother Beckett was in Joba before we went to Cape Town also we all were together so uh we don't um fight all the way from the beginning the fighting only started afterwards so I play the St to show you what happened way back there and um even the statements that brother Raymond made I'm sure there States out there too that I made statements about brother Beckett being my friend that's why he has in his um study there's nothing like old friends and I can tell you if I phone him uh all these years although we had our differences we still get together and have something to eat with his wife and what have you and we respect one another you know we have our differences so brother don't come with your own ideas about we leaving a legacy like that we didn't leave a legacy like that that's why I know that right now you know like u a certain prominent brother told me what's happening in the states there more people leaving the message than in the message I know things are very critical I know things are very bad but uh it wasn't so way back there so uh I hope that you would uh uh listen carefully how we covered one another's backs may God bless you and uh um maybe you could if you have an opportunity or a chance to uh thank brother Raymond for that accolades that he gave out on the stap may God bless you and there's nothing negative on the St thank you\n"}, {"id": "2023-02-22 - A

I don't know if you see the clips and the videos and the preaching. It's on another level. Can we stand up and give them a hand? And the reason why I want you to stand up and give them a hand, they travel the country to record the man of God. And the reason you need to give them a hand, it's easy to buy data to look it on your coach than to travel to the real live meeting. They make it possible for you to relax and watch it at home.

You know you here but the whole year there's people on the sides here. A school every day every year since we started the school is still here. [Applause] Not God in the prison only. God in the school. [Music] [Applause] [Music] We want to thank the principal, the vice principal, the teachers, and every worker here. They work every day to keep the school going. And you know how many made it because of this El Tabernacle. We gave up on the school, but God did not give up on. And by God's grace, we're going to open up again 2026. [Applause] You want to give the teachers a good applause. Your regret, your reward is great [Applause] from the school, the family, everyone. The school was never in a better financial place like now. [Music] Going into 2026, we were never all right with the school like now because God is in the school. &gt;&gt; Whatever this man, [Music] fruit comes. Forgive me, church, but I like the truth. And if you don't believe it, look at his fruit and worship the fruit. [Music] By the end of this year, we'll be able to give a full financial report of what God done in his school. God got a school. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember, but God's got a school. [Music] El Tabernacle. God's got to school. And both my kids made it years ago because God had a school. I don't think Edgar and Esther turned out very bad. They wouldn't have made it if God didn't have a school. Jal and Joel wouldn't have made God had a school. All the grandchildren made it because God had a school. &gt;&gt; Thanks the teachers. Thank the principal. And behind that, thank the God of the apostle. The apostle saw it through for us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [Music] through that school and everything. Be patient with Edgar Roscoll. &gt;&gt; Be patient with him. &gt;&gt; All is well on our way. We are well on our way that apostle. We want to thank King Jesus for the bonuses we gave all the workers and teachers this year. We could bless them more than any year. Everyone that is from Y tabernet the companies didn't give bonuses that most companies didn't give a year end function but God in El Tabernacle in a man in a in the leader of this blessed you though times are hard he blessed you he didn't have to do it but he did thank you king Jesus Yes, [Applause] we thank God we could some places we lifted up the bonuses by 2,000 rain. We gave more than any year in the worst time. Is God here? &gt;&gt; Are you pressing stop? &gt;&gt; But God is pressing play. That's why whoever wants to stop it will take the remote out and keep it playing. &gt;&gt; El tabernacle don't say leadership. We got leadership. And brother, the lifting up is just the natural side. How many people was lifted up spiritually this year &gt;&gt; that you can't even talk of? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then for the first time this year &gt;&gt; or in the in this year especially the people from far cleaned this place not as visitors. &gt;&gt; They slept here not as visitors.

I'm Rosanne Adams and tonight we're taking a look back and reflecting on the year. Now, in the 2025 World Cup Roller Fly, we saw our local team, the MBRC, make its mark with two familiar names flying high in the face of adversity. Our senior pastor, Jonathan, took to the skies with tough winds and recording a score of 54.08, showing great composure despite the unpredictable nature of the outdoor competition. And then our apostle Edah Hill scored an impressive 125.58. Even under the strong wind conditions, the Apostle's performance stood as one of the greatest representations of our region. Even under difficult weather conditions, qualifying him for recognition on the world stage. [Music] [Music] I greet you um all I'm uh my name is Edar Rosco and um I have pictures for over 20 is. [Music] [Music] Now, we witnessed the EHR79 Cup unfold across three major tournaments, and the finale produced one of the most dramatic and intense finishes. At the end of the tournament, Shooting Stars and Volcano were level on 27 points, forcing the championship to be decided by gold defense. Shooting Stars, however, claimed the title with a superior goal difference of 114, narrowly edging out volcanoes on 92 points. Gunners FC, the reigning champions from last year, successfully defended their title, finishing the season on 22 points. Closely behind were Loft House, who mounted a strong challenge throughout the tournament and ended on just two points a drift on 20 points. More than the competition, the EHR 79 Cup stood as a collective sacrifice towards the building of the Durban Church. Every match played, every point scored, and every cheer contributed to God's greater plan. Whether winning or losing on the field, we are all winners in supporting the work of the Lord. The EL1 Racing Championship delivered excitement throughout the year, but there can only be one champion. Team Aston Martin stood victoriously on the podium after speeding through their final race. In terms of individual driver standings, pastor Edgar Karosco Jr. claimed the EL1 championship title. This season was yet another proud moment for Al Tabernacle and a testament to our excellence in every arena. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Beyond Sport 2025 was rich in teaching and guiding to our tabernacle. The women's seminar provided wisdom, encouragement, and practical instruction to the ladies of eel tabernacle. While the men's camp became a place of reflection, accountability, and strengthening. Advice given during these gatherings addressed family, faith, responsibility, and purpose, leaving a lasting impact to extend beyond the year. was featured. The atmosphere was electrifying and uplifting. What a blessed and amazing day we had to tell you all. Nothing was outsourced. Our speakers, our caterers, our florists, our decor ladies, everything proudly El Tabernacle. Not forgetting El Tabernacle's Gospel Concert held by our very own mass choir and instrumental ensemble. The seasons of praise gospel concert celebrated our unchanging praise with the changing seasons. [Music] And then at the heart of 2025 was the Apostle Ed Rosco who led eel tabernacle through a powerful sequence of services throughout the year. Our 2025 year began with the sermon the mighty angel revelations 10:1 the keystone revelation. The apostle then preached at the January combined meeting the gospel trumpet has sounded part one. On the 2nd of February, we heard the apostle preaching on the bess and beard comments. The 22nd and the 23rd of February, the apostle held the Bible study on the depths of revelations 10 part 5 all the way in Penda. On the 1st of March, the apostle preached the gospel trumpet has sounded part two. During the Easter convention, the apostle has preached the bride's Easter. And on the 31st of May, the Apostle preached part two of the bride's Easter. We then heard the foolish virgin on the 29th of June. And at the funeral of our late elder, the apostle preached after the coffin. What then? On the 2nd of August, we heard the foolish virgin part two. On the 17th of August, the apostle preached in Hebron the lost anointing. And during that August combined meeting, Handlers of the Oil was preached. On the 22nd of September, Handlers of the Oil part two was preached. The greatest sermon ever preached, the prophetic insight in Matthew 25. The seventh seal was preached on the 10th of October. During the Bloomfontain services, the apostle preached on the foolish church and later that week held a question and answer session for the youth at VU during the November month. And on the 7th of December, the Apostle traveled all the way to Richmond and preached on God's journalists. And during the convention, the apostle preached on part two of the greatest sermon ever preached, the prophetic insight in Matthew 25, the seventh seal. Our apostle has gone above and beyond to ensure that our cups are running over. As we look back, it's clear that 2025 was the year of impact for eel tabernacle. impact through sport, impact through teachings, impact through music, and most importantly, impact through the Holy Ghost. And with that, the 2025 season comes to an end. This is E News Network, keeping you informed and connected. Until next time, happy new year.

Amen. &gt;&gt; So without ado, I need to do something tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. um maybe very contrary to the feeling that you are &gt;&gt; and um I'm bringing forth a confession of a murderer. I killed a man after 60 plus years. I had to make this confession tonight. I need to repent. I call it a confession of a murderer. And they will never find his body. &gt;&gt; The guy &gt;&gt; that I killed &gt;&gt; while I was 18 to 20 years old. I killed a man. &gt;&gt; This man was water in my blood. &gt;&gt; Always against me. stood in my way if I wanted to do something. &gt;&gt; Like Paul says, the copper smid. &gt;&gt; This man done me much harm. When I was a young when I was young, he was my best friend. But he made me to dishonor my parents. You know how friends go when it comes to your parents and what your parents want you to be and then they have a way to influence you to dishonor your parents &gt;&gt; and disobey your parents. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I nearly turned out a juvenile delinquent because of him. I nearly became a renegade, disobedient to my parents. [Music] When we got older, he introduced me to the wrong company. [Music] That's why I know when I see your friends, I know your company &gt;&gt; and I know who you are. He made me run after goals. I was quite a handsome young guy. I knew how to dress and I had them flocking after me. [Music] Brother Beckard asked me one time him and his wife and all those girls that was running after you. I said I kissed them all because of this friend. He introduced me to sport that never that nearly took my heart away because I nearly went to England. [Music] I doubt there was a guy that scored as many goals as what I have and my friend boosted me. He took me to the pleasures of the world and he drove me from church. [Music] And I said to myself, \"So far, my friend.\" [Music] Then I came to a place, how can I kill this guy? [Music] I cornered him one time. I cornered him, Brother Raymond. There was no way out for him. I planned it to precision. at this place. You won't get away. I'm going to kill him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Would you like to know what corner I caught him in? &gt;&gt; It was at the altar of the Nazarene church. [Music] The guy couldn't escape. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I killed him at that altar. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you know what I done with his body? I took his body and threw it into the sea of forgetfulness. [Applause] And they couldn't find his body &gt;&gt; cuz his body is gone. His old life is gone. Christina [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Because I hated myself. &gt;&gt; Oh, wretched man that I am. &gt;&gt; Who can save me? Hallelujah. [Applause] And every time, every day, brother Raymond, &gt;&gt; he wants to jump up. &gt;&gt; And then I die daily. &gt;&gt; I kill him daily. And I was going to ask the church as you look at this man behind the pulpit, &gt;&gt; wouldn't you like to become murderers? Let us kill ourselves. and let us have a new life. Jesus Christ. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And that's my confession of a murderer. I can see all over the world. They say sh Never forget. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My confession. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, if you have your Bibles with you &gt;&gt; as you prepare to die next year, &gt;&gt; you came to die today. &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. today. to be. &gt;&gt; I never gave you that one, Edgar, because I didn't want you to steal my Hallelujah. There's no judge that can sentence me. &gt;&gt; He hasn't got a body. &gt;&gt; No judge can sentence you. Wow. I woke up two days ago and this thing came to me. I said, \"Oh my god, &gt;&gt; a confession of a murderer.\" [Applause] [Music] [Applause] He has no good people. He has all murderers. Yeah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay, you've got your Bibles with you. &gt;&gt; We're going to turn to Matthew 25. Matthew 25 verse 10 to find it. I will read it. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. While the foolish virgin went out to buy the oil, the bridegroom came. &gt;&gt; The half an hour silence was finished. And they that were ready went in. The ones that was ready. But the bride has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; They went in. And my title is as follows. And the door was shut. &gt;&gt; I like to preach on and the door was shut. I'd like you to say with me again. &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] What a year we had last year, huh? &gt;&gt; I just want to say before going into the message, I really do not know about 2026. Amen. &gt;&gt; I try to look into it. &gt;&gt; I try to see something like normally when I come, it looks so dumb to me because 2025 was based on Trump. He had Kalansky at him. He had most of the presidents visiting him this year. He had a lot of wars that he tries to stop this year. And he hardly stops them then they go on again. He was preaching one gospel peace &gt;&gt; which is Matthew 24 &gt;&gt; war was which is Matthew 24. &gt;&gt; In the meantime he caused war somewhere else. He lifted up the taxes &gt;&gt; money fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; He remind me of that second woman &gt;&gt; in the sixth vision &gt;&gt; representing Rome. Everything he does thus far &gt;&gt; is to do with that sixth vision. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I do not know it looks so bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. that 2026 America will be 250 years old. In 2026, Israel will be 80 years in the in the promised land. Now, I hope I'm not prophesying. &gt;&gt; I'm hoping that as things look, I hope Los Angeles sink. [Music] It is about the best time &gt;&gt; to sing &gt;&gt; because you will have the World Cup &gt;&gt; in Los Angeles &gt;&gt; next year. [Music] So remember, I say I hope. &gt;&gt; And if there's anybody here that don't hope the way I hope, &gt;&gt; then I'm sure you're not ready &gt;&gt; to move. I want to say even so Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; let you go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It will be two years nearly after the 70th Jubilee. [Applause] [Music] There was a lot of cases in 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They never had such a lot of cases. &gt;&gt; Amen. indictments. &gt;&gt; And normally after the indictment come the prison &gt;&gt; sentence. &gt;&gt; Now why I say so? It's because when the door was shut &gt;&gt; in the time of Sodom, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sodom and Gomorrah &gt;&gt; had an earthquake. So friends, &gt;&gt; you don't have to even ask your pastor about a thing like this. &gt;&gt; You got two eyes and you got two ears. &gt;&gt; Why don't you start looking around? And the king of England also wants to visit 2025 &gt;&gt; America. And Trump wants to give a big bash. [Music] And normally in the Bible when Nebuchadnezzar had a big bash, &gt;&gt; the handwriting [Music] on the wall. And that's why I chose this title. &gt;&gt; And the door is shut. [Applause] [Music] When the oil stopped and there was no more oil &gt;&gt; and there was no more Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and there was no more token. Amen. &gt;&gt; These foolish virgins, &gt;&gt; they knew they didn't have oil. [Applause] [Music] The Bible says that they went out &gt;&gt; to go look for oil. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of those days say when they went out they didn't find oil. Nowhere in the Bible &gt;&gt; does it say they found oil. &gt;&gt; Now, why didn't they find oil? Is because the wise virgin bought up all the oil. [Applause] Every service she pulled up. Every service she bought oil. every service. She didn't set stone and let it pass by. She grabbed it. Every service and now there is no oil. Hey, &gt;&gt; and they ran out to try and go and find the oil. &gt;&gt; This one runs to that church and preach to that pastor. to see if he can bring oil to that church while his church hasn't got oil. How can he go to another church to bring oil and that pastor go to another pastor? They went out. Nobody goes out of El Tabernacle. We have the oil. The oil here. The oil is here. Heat. Heat. And while they running up and down to one another's churches tried to bring oil in one another's churches, the Bible says they didn't find the oil &gt;&gt; and then the Bible concludes &gt;&gt; and the doors was I don't hear you. that that same door &gt;&gt; that was shut for them &gt;&gt; was open for us. cuz the roof supposed to come Oh, love. Hallelujah. There &gt;&gt; gets locked &gt;&gt; at certain junctions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of God's time. &gt;&gt; Different times in God's thoughts, &gt;&gt; doors get shut, [Applause] gets closed, [Applause] &gt;&gt; when that door closed, &gt;&gt; God don't care. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're a pregnant woman, &gt;&gt; he kills you. &gt;&gt; God don't care if you dishonor your mother and your father. &gt;&gt; God is after you, young child. He's going to kill you. &gt;&gt; Because the door is closed. He don't care which church you belong to. If you hunted with brother Brennham and you slept with brother Brennham and your brother Brennham around every corner, if you do not have the oil, he's going to kill you. [Music] These foolish virgins was panomites. And I don't care what the pastor says. I don't care what your pastor says. It's what the Bible says and what brother Brham says. That's it. You don't have the oil, you die. The doors are shut. &gt;&gt; The first 2,000 years, God shut &gt;&gt; Noah in. Genesis 7:16, &gt;&gt; the doors were shut. &gt;&gt; 7:16, God tells Noah, \"Come into the ark.\" That means that God was already in the ark. Does that mean if the door is shut that God is in El Tabernacle? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. The second 2,000 years the Jews rejected. The Gentiles accepted it. &gt;&gt; As God says in Acts 13:46, Paul says, \"Now we turning to the Gentiles because the door for the Jews was shut and it came over to us and here we are tonight. The door was open to us. The oil came and made us walk into the door. Aren't you happy? You didn't sit outside the door. You walked into the door and behind the door Jesus was waiting for you. Come in and sap with me. Come into the wedding supper. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The third 2,000 years &gt;&gt; is Matthew 25:10. what we read &gt;&gt; after the oil, &gt;&gt; after they rejected the oil, &gt;&gt; after they knew they don't have oil, &gt;&gt; the minute they heard the voice &gt;&gt; of the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; they realized they didn't have oil. &gt;&gt; But these guys in the message, they don't even know they don't have oil. How bad are they? But when they look in El Tabernacle, they can see they don't have oil because the oil is here. I claim it. [Music] And I asked Daniel of Congo, said, \"Daniel, could you take me to any place outside of Eltean? that has the oil. I'll pay your fair. &gt;&gt; And I'm saying this for over 20 years. &gt;&gt; For 20 years, nobody came up to come and show me where the oil is. But but right here. Look at the oil flowing. And the oil is coming down. The oil is coming down. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. [Applause] Hallelujah. That makes 6,000 years. [Applause] And now the door is shut. &gt;&gt; Ministers, you can be cross with me. &gt;&gt; You know I'm talking the truth. &gt;&gt; You know the door is shut. It's closed. There's no movement of the Holy Ghost. Working of the Holy Ghost is none. Nowhere to be found. &gt;&gt; You must beg the people to worship. But when the oil come down, you don't beg anybody to dance, to shout, speak in tongues. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat up here. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The other day I got a phone. I found the wrong number and um Sister Judith picked up the phone and she told me, she says, \"Uh, Apostle, I feel that the Holy Spirit told me that there's a big revival coming to South Africa.\" I kept quiet. I didn't say anything. And she says, \"Uh, what do you think, uh, Apostle I said, \"Judith, you know I'm going to tell you the truth.\" &gt;&gt; I said, \"It's finished. The door's closed.\" &gt;&gt; Shot. It's goodbye. &gt;&gt; Never again. Will the thunders fail the Gloria? &gt;&gt; The Gloria came with Dio Gloria Edgarco and it's still here today. It's nowhere else and it will stay here because the oil is here. And listen, &gt;&gt; God was in the ark. &gt;&gt; God was sealed. in the bride in Pentecost &gt;&gt; and the door closed to the Jews. [Music] &gt;&gt; And now Matthew 25, the groom closed the door. &gt;&gt; The doors closed. &gt;&gt; When the oil is gone, &gt;&gt; the door starts moving. &gt;&gt; And then what happened when the door is closed? Let's read St. John. &gt;&gt; Could you read it? What happened? &gt;&gt; When the door gets shut, then comes Jesus. May he come here tonight and answer your prayer. May he come here tonight and make you a murderer. May he come here tonight. May he make you a jailer. Paul a prisoner of Christ. You are prisoner of al tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Let's see the sketch. 6,000 years is up. &gt;&gt; The first 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; They walked into the ark. &gt;&gt; God was in the ark. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the door closed, God was inside &gt;&gt; and then it rained. &gt;&gt; And then it rain. &gt;&gt; Watch out. It's going to rain after tonight. You are not going to be able to sit still, stand still because it's going to rain. Only in the bride is going to rain. The wise virgin &gt;&gt; and didn't rain. &gt;&gt; The rain came down in Torance. &gt;&gt; And I heard they singing the world. &gt;&gt; I hear them singing the world. Can't you see the rain is gone? &gt;&gt; Mhm. It's dry. So dry in every church. Can't you see the rain is gone? The Holy Ghost is gone. And as it rained, you know what the rain done? The rain took the ark, the word, and lifted it up. &gt;&gt; The rain took the word and lifted it up. Oh, thank you. When when the enemy comes in like a flood, the oil, the spirit of the Lord raises you up. This is my bride. Yes, she is. You lifted up in the message. They know who you are. The oil lifted you up. And they say there's no church like your church. [Music] Hallelujah. The &gt;&gt; second 2,000 years, God seals the Gentiles. The Jews are rejected. They don't get the Holy Ghost to choose. &gt;&gt; They only get it after we finish with it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; After it finishes it work amongst the Gentiles. Then only Revelation 7:1 I saw an angel coming from the east putting a mark, the seal of God onto the 144,000, but only After El tabernacle has sucked in every book of the oil. Oh brother. Tell me. Tell me, tell me that angel of Revelation 7:1, the ceiling angel, &gt;&gt; is it the same angel that you feel here now? He's here. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Revelation 7:1, &gt;&gt; that sealing angel &gt;&gt; in Elijah and Moses &gt;&gt; seals 144,000. &gt;&gt; But in Matthew 25, that same sealing angel &gt;&gt; in Edgar Ocon will seal off the ground. I take my stand. Oh, heat, heat. We gave you the quote. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says the Holy Ghost is in the hands of the church &gt;&gt; and he gives out the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; eternal life. So I take my stand. The ceiling angel in at the rostel seals you. Keep the oil. Yeah. Keep the oil. Yeah. Keep the oil. Yeah. Heat up Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Come on, let's go. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Just go to Genesis 18. Where is the greater works, &gt;&gt; church? Where is the greater works? They don't even preach it because they no know it. And if they know it, they need to produce it. But we know it &gt;&gt; and we producing it. Oh my. [Applause] [Music] 11. [Music] &gt;&gt; I want to show you something. Yeah. You see, I'm taking my time tonight. [Music] I want to read this. Genesis 19 and verse 11. Just give us a chance. &gt;&gt; Don't forget this quote. All these years they said they think they got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost belong to Jesus. No, it belongs to us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The wise version says, \"We can't give you our oil.\" &gt;&gt; It's not ours. &gt;&gt; I claimed it. &gt;&gt; Nothing you can do. &gt;&gt; Let's read. All two things happens here. &gt;&gt; They first &gt;&gt; smite them. &gt;&gt; They first shut the door. And when the door was shut closed, &gt;&gt; they blinded them, &gt;&gt; never to see the rapture, the oil again. &gt;&gt; Now tonight, the door is shut and they will never see and find the door, the Holy Ghost, the oil. Again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Again. [Music] &gt;&gt; You young men see that you get the oil. And now you know what happens? &gt;&gt; The children in the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. is panic stricken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They hear me preach the oil is gone and you don't have it. &gt;&gt; And the children in all these churches &gt;&gt; is shivering &gt;&gt; because they know &gt;&gt; they don't have the oil. But the children in this house &gt;&gt; cannot be panicking because a champagne epic. Champagne epic. &gt;&gt; You only lift up champagne glasses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you have victory, &gt;&gt; if you won the battle, &gt;&gt; the wise virgin won the battle. &gt;&gt; Is a champagne epic. Let me see your champagne glasses there. Hallelujah. Now, one thing about a door, &gt;&gt; a door &gt;&gt; is made to open. [Music] A doors made to open, &gt;&gt; but it's not meant to always be open. &gt;&gt; There's a time it's going to close. &gt;&gt; There was a time when the door Jesus Christ was open. &gt;&gt; Come all ye that labor and I have labor. But there is also a time when the door of longsuffering gets some close. And this is not the time for the door to open. This is the time to close the door and lock the bride inside. Are you locked in? And a door, a door has two hinges &gt;&gt; that opens and close it. &gt;&gt; If it's got what? If if it's got one hinge, &gt;&gt; then it can't &gt;&gt; open or close. &gt;&gt; If you only got the word, &gt;&gt; it can't open and close. But the Lord Jesus Christ got two hinges. Spirit and truth dynamics and &gt;&gt; former rain and rain. &gt;&gt; Former rain. &gt;&gt; Then let the door close then. Heat. Heat. Now, &gt;&gt; the door can close, but somebody can still open it, right? &gt;&gt; But a door has a lock on. &gt;&gt; And a lock needs a key. And a key is faith. &gt;&gt; And faith come by the seven thunders give you faith. Have you got the seven thunders? &gt;&gt; Then you got the key. &gt;&gt; Keep the key. [Applause] You can open the door. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you can Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My my hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] And then the bridegroom says to her, &gt;&gt; \"Come in. &gt;&gt; Come in.\" Amen. &gt;&gt; While the door was closed to the foolish version, &gt;&gt; Revelations 4:1 says there's a door open in heaven for the bride. &gt;&gt; And a voice says, \"Come up higher.\" Brian, &gt;&gt; El Tabernacle, &gt;&gt; come up higher. Come up higher. &gt;&gt; And yellow is a mystery. &gt;&gt; And he says, \"Come in.\" Now, how could you go in to the wedding supper with this flesh body? &gt;&gt; That means they had a body change. [Music] &gt;&gt; Before they could go in, &gt;&gt; their body changed. You had a body change &gt;&gt; for you killed that old man &gt;&gt; and now you have a body change. &gt;&gt; Your body changed. The things you used to do, you do them no more. You had a body change. You had a body change. You don't like nice times anymore &gt;&gt; because the night times now lay behind the door. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now. Come on out. Right here in verse 10. The voice and the trumpet took place &gt;&gt; and they changed &gt;&gt; and then they went in cuz they can't go in with their bodies. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; So I show you a mystery here that the wise virgin went in. But you know, &gt;&gt; there was one of the foolish virgins that slipped in with him. &gt;&gt; She look alike &gt;&gt; in every way and she slipped in. How? Nobody knows. But she was in the wedding. Every now and then they slip in. Yeah. [Applause] And the bridegroom said to her, \"Friend, &gt;&gt; what are you doing here in E Tabernacle? &gt;&gt; You didn't come from Raymond Thompson. &gt;&gt; What do you want here? We see you don't have the your Gloria garment on. &gt;&gt; Get out friends. and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave the rest of the message &gt;&gt; and the door tonight is shut. Will the pianos come? &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that needs the wedding garment? &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that needs more? [Applause] Now, let's call on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Call on him. Cuz when the door is shut, he's standing right next to you now. [Applause] You speak to him. as the oil is leaving Al tabernacle and going over to Gaza where the Jews are finishing the thing off. Let us keep the oil. [Music] I'm finished. Everybody. Come on. Come on. Oh, hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Amen. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. America. [Applause] Oh my [Applause] search me Lord. Suit. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] And the door is shut.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Lord, [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] as I finish [Music] off this meeting. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Remember, [Music] &gt;&gt; more than 20 years ago, [Music] &gt;&gt; I told you the Holy Ghost is gone. And now I come back to show you the sequence. If the Holy Ghost leaves, the door gets shut. [Music] &gt;&gt; And now the door is shut. [Applause] [Music] If that door shuts and you still a sinner, you're never going to be saved. Your day is gone. [Music] Cuz he shuts the door and you can't find the door no more. [Music] You can't even save your children's soul. [Music] The foolish virgin said a half an hour [Applause] to fill up and it didn't fill up. [Music] And then the Holy Ghost leaves them and heaven's door shuts. [Music] All these years it was just open as much as that &gt;&gt; and you could only go in like a crab like this. Now it's closed. It's gone. [Applause] But brother Oscar, what about them that's still coming? God's got his talked away that never heard the gospel. But you that hear the gospel. Goodbye. [Applause] I hope I'm wrong, but up till now I am not. [Music] And the door is shut. It's closed. We going to be able to pick up one here and one there and one there. As I said, the door Jesus is not going to be always open. [Music] He closes the door. That's why I came with that little story. [Music] A murderous confession. We can only kill ourselves and beg for mercy. You oldtimes that's been so long with us. Watch that the devil don't trick you against the ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't get too big for your boots [Music] because the door is closed. You'll never come in back again. Two years ago, we spoke on the 70th Jubilee and the church was packed with vacciners. You remember how many of them could make it? [Music] None. None. And how bad is it going to be now when the door is shut? And this is where the foolish virgin made her biggest mistake. We put it on. You're doing what you are told, foolish virgin, but not doing what's right. Your pastors told you a lot of things that's not scriptural. And you were doing what was what they told you, but you didn't do what God said. You do what your girlfriend told you, [Music] but you didn't do what is right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young girl, you're running after flesh [Music] and you don't even know it's time to drop the flesh, [Music] to kill the flesh. [Music] It's time that you search yourself [Music] before we go into this new year. [Music] A thing that I hate that I see in our tabernacle is these young children that wants to tell their parents what to do. Found a sister from Cape Town. says the child want to go home. Send the deacons over there. The child was under drugs pressing her. She must go home. Since when do we hear listen to children? When Gersian didn't listen, I kicked him out. Al tabernacle don't listen to children. [Music] Children listens to us. [Music] They do what they told from their friends, but they don't do what is right. It's time we do what is right. Search me. [Music] Oh Lord, [Music] I told a sister the other day, take your heart off your child cuz you're going to lose your soul, too. [Music] stubborn. And now it's nearly impossible for you to come back. [Music] You struggled with your boy all the years cuz you patched him up. How does he look tonight? How is he looking tonight? [Music] It's no time to patch up. Son or no son, kick him out. [Applause] If Job, Noah, Daniel had to live in this day tonight, they could only save their own souls. Can't save your children's souls. They want to go to hell. I told Gersian, \"When you open your eyes, you saw me here. And when you close this eyes, you're going to find me here. [Music] You're too nice with your children because you think if you're so nice that's love. That's not love. That's compromise. Because it's your child. I don't know how many people, deacons even that was with me, that straightened out all the other people's children. When it came to theirs, they couldn't straighten them out. They left with their children and they backsliden with their children. Only thing that helps [Music] is God's word. [Music] [Applause] Search me. Stop looking at your child. Look at Jesus. If you don't act like Jesus is not worthy to be your boy. [Music] [Applause] Wouldn't [Music] you like to kill yourself tonight? [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Is there any wicked ways still to live in you? &gt;&gt; Let's kill that wicked way tonight. [Music] Let's commit suicide. [Music] [Applause] [Music] God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; And the doors [Applause] are shut. And the wise virgin says, \"I cannot give you any oil. [Music] I just got enough for myself.\" Brother Oscar, why don't you go to the other churches and help them? I already done it. Here's the flags hanging. They didn't want it. Look at all those flags. But on every flag there's a tape. And now I cannot do it no more because the door is shut. Brother Jonathan [Music] Let me see. Amen. [Music] Search me, oh God, and all my today. [Music] Oh, save. Oh my go [Music] see the be [Music] some Bring the light in me. [Music] Amen. Set me free. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Is there anybody? [Music] It says this was for me, not for somebody next to you. Your apostle spoke to me. Is there anybody like that? [Music] Not someone else is the target. I'm the target. It was directly to my [Music] kill myself. [Music] There's people at the altar. &gt;&gt; There's people killing themselves. That way it be [Music] and [Music] Oh son. Oh God, [Music] my heart [Music] for we're going to take communion tonight. the crossing over tonight. Is there anyone that examined themselves or was it just somebody else? You felt, \"No, that's not for me. Somebody else.\" But before we take the communion, are you examining what the man said? [Music] I beg you to ask him &gt;&gt; who was talking to us tonight. [Music] &gt;&gt; Is there a young girl that is rude to her parents? Are you examining yourself? [Music] Oh, tonight I realize God's spirit not going to strive with any man anymore. [Music] God is not going to strive anymore. You heard he strived all the time. Is there anyone here? Why are you okay? You feel okay? It's fine. [Music] You'll feel [Music] &gt;&gt; I'll be your next year then you [Music] &gt;&gt; say anybody I don't want to be a preacher tonight that expects you to worship and I don't worship when God speaks. I don't want to be like that. I want to tell you, but I'm not doing help the preacher tonight. Lord, tabernacle, it's later than what you think it is.

[Music] [Music] Amen. As we turn to our scripture, scripture, turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 11, reading from verse 23 to 34. If you have it, it reads as follows. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"Take it. This is my body which is broken for you. This give me remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup. When he has supper, saying, \"This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, it will show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore, whoever shall eat this bread and drink it this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body in the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are just, we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore my brethren, when you come together to eat tar for one another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that you come not together unto condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. We just take moment of silence as we examine ourselves. Amen. I want to ask brotherly to come and pray for the Lord's table. Amen. Amen. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you blessed savior. Father, it's with a humble heart. Father, it's with a contrite spirit, Lord, that we bow before thee this evening, Lord, we want to say thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, that we are behind the shut door, Lord Jesus. Father, for where you have kept us, Lord. Father, Lord, we want to say thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus.

Oh great eternal heavenly father Lord, how can we close a champagne epic such as this tonight? Oh God, Lord, we're so thankful, heavenly father, Lord, that you brought us thus far. And we're so thankful, Lord, that you sent an angel our way, heavenly father. Lord, when we look back to 2025, we started the year with a mighty angel. And we're so thankful, Lord God, that that mighty angels could keep their doors open for El Tabernacle for us to cross over in to the higher calling this evening. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you, Lord, for an upward pool, oh God, that could pull us in through the door. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful that we could be part of you and your beautiful kingdom this evening. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you so much for the man that is the pinnacle of prophecies to the Gentile dispensation. Oh God, Lord, when we look back to 2025, we can see, Lord, that surely you've been Jehovah Gyra, the Lord our provider. Lord, you've been Jehovah Shama, the everpresent help in the time of trouble and trials. Oh God, we're so thankful, Lord, that we've seen you in different attributes and different ways throughout this year. Oh God, and we're so thankful, oh God, that in El Tabernacle, we know you as Jehovah Rosco, the manifestation of God in flesh. Lord, thank you, Lord, for coming down our way to open the way to open the door. Heavenly Father, and to call us into the beloved of the Lord. Thank you for opening the door for us, heavenly father. Lord, that we can be in the joy of the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful for everything you've done for us, Lord. And Lord, as we depart, Lord, may your spirit go and prepare the way for those that will be traveling, Lord, to our respective homes. Heavenly Father, Lord, may that same angel that started last year, that started this year, Lord God, may he go with us as he shut us into the Shakina glory, as he shut us into the Aoya of God, may that Aoya that we were shut into move heavenly father, Lord, and protect us as we leave to our respective homes, oh God. May you just bless us with safe traveling mercies. Lord, we pray Lord for our precious apostle that you'd strengthen him. Heavenly Father, like never before, Lord. We've never seen a man such as this. Heavenly Father, thank you for sending us an odd pole. Thank you for sending us a man that we can see right through the footprints of the Bible. Lord, we pray Lord that you'd restore all the virtue that has left his body. Remember our precious senior pastor Jonathan, Pastor Jude, our precious pastor Edgar Rosco Jr., Brother GL, the entire Rosco family, Lord. God, bless and undertake for them even the more, Lord. May the same fullness that dwells upon the father dwell upon each and every one of them, Lord. And just like Aaron, Lord, may it reach from the head down to the beard, heavenly father, Lord, and even down to the skirts. And may we just be filled with more of that rain that Apostle says should fall upon us, heavenly father. May it rain so much upon us until we lose trace of our flesh in the sea of forgetfulness. Lord, may you take our flesh so deep in the sea of forgetfulness until we cannot even go and take it back. Heavenly Father, thank you so much for this beautiful service. May you bless each and everyone that is here. And may we depart Lord in your shakina glory. We ask it not by might, not by power, but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the apostle in your infallible name of Jesus King God. Amen and amen. [Music] Amen.
