[{"id": "65-0220 - God's Chosen Place Of Worship.txt", "text": "L-1 Let us remain standing for a moment as we bow our heads for prayer. And now, with our heads bowed, and I trust our hearts are bowed, too, I wonder how many in here tonight would like to be remembered in prayer, of something special? Would you just raise your hand, say, \"God, give to me tonight that what I'm seeking for.\" The Lord bless you.\n\nL-2 Our Heavenly Father, as we now humbly approach this great Throne of grace, by faith, we move into the Beyonds; where God, and the Angels, and the Cherubims, and all the Heavenly host is assembled together. For He said there cannot be even a sparrow fall to the ground without the Heavenly Father knowing it. How much more does He know here when hundreds of people have their heads bowed, and calling upon Thee for special requests. Father, look down upon the needy world tonight, for we are a needy people. [Luke 12:6-7], [Matthew 10:29-31]\n\nL-3 And I pray, God, that because that we have assembled here and expressing to Thee our faith in a living God Who does answer prayer; we have come out from among the world of the uncircumcised, of the heart and ears, come out to live a separate life, and to live in confessing our faith in Thee. Tonight we've raised our hands, and saying, \"We're needy.\" Dear God, answer every one of their requests.\n\nL-4 And then, Father, we pray that You'll visit us tonight in the Word. We come here for correction, for understanding, that we might know just how to live in this present day; what to look forward to, what to do. For, we know the Coming of the Lord is drawing nigh, according to all the signs that the prophets foretold. We're nearing the time, Lord, when complete deliverance will be given to Your children. God, let us, every one, be there, Father. May there not be one missing. That's our purpose of being here, Lord. We love You, and we're trying to prepare for that hour. [II Timothy 3:16-17], [I Timothy 4:1-3]\n\nL-5 Speak to us, we ask again, tonight. And heal the sick. All the sick and the afflicted that's in the building, we pray that You will heal them, Lord; and especially them with spiritual needs. We pray that You'll save every lost soul. Fill every believer with the Holy Spirit. And renew the strength and Power in Your believing children. Grant these things, Father. We ask much, because You told us to ask, \"ask abundance, ask for great things, many of them,\" that our joys might be made full. And we ask them in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. May be seated.\n\nL-6 I certainly deem this a grand privilege tonight, to be back here at the platform again, here in this high school, to face these fine people that's gathered out to hear the Gospel. I ask God's mercy to help me to tell you the Truth as far as I know the Truth. He still can close the mouth of a man, the same as He could the mouth of a lion. And if I would ever try to say anything that was wrong and contrary to His will, my sincere prayer is that He would close my mouth, that I won't say it. For, truly, I want to be in Heaven, myself; and I'd never be there, and, besides all that, I'd be a false leader, somebody who had done something falsely. If I do it, it's because I don't know no different. The Lord bless you.\n\nL-7 Now, tomorrow morning, if it be the will of God, I aim to speak on that subject, Marriage And Divorce. And we trust that you'll come, and bring your pencils and papers. We won't take too long, but I'd just like to... That was my purpose of being back here, first, in Indiana, that I promised you that. And I will try, tomorrow morning. If I don't get it tomorrow morning, I will tomorrow night. But I'm going to try tomorrow morning, if the Lord willing, to speak on the subject, the two schools of thoughts. And may God help us to know what is Truth, just to know what's Truth, so we can walk in Truth and in Light. We...\n\nL-8 You know, used to have an old colored friend. He said to me, he said, \"Brother Billy,\" he said, \"I--I don't want any trouble at the river.\" He said, \"I want to have my ticket in my hand. And when the whistle blows, I don't want any trouble there. I've asked the Lord, a long time ago, if there's anything wrong, let me settle it up right now,\" said, \"because it'll be dark and stormy on that morning when the ship pulls out for the other side.\" Said, \"I don't want any interference. I want to take care of all of it now.\" That's what we're here for, try to take care of all the interferences, so that we can walk aboard on that hour. 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min\n\nL-9 Now, I won't speak to you very long tonight, because we got two services tomorrow. And then I take right off, somewhere else, to another, more services.\n\nL-10 But, now, in the Book of Deuteronomy. I wish to read from the 16th chapter, the first three verses, of Deuteronomy 16:1 to 3. Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover... the LORD thy God:... in the (fourth) month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of--out of Egypt by night. Thou shall therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flocks and of the herd, in the place which the LORD has chosen to place his name there. [Deuteronomy 16:1-3]\n\nL-11 Now, my subject tonight is: God's Chosen Place Of Worship. If you notice, the month A-b-a-d... -b there is, means, \"April.\" The month of April is when they were brought out. And now the strange thing is that we tonight, as worshipers of God, in this day that we live in, and we find so many different ideas of people. And as long as there is different ideas about thing, there's got different questions; there's got to be one true answer to every question that's asked. If I would ask the question, \"What is this?\" \"Well,\" they'd say, \"a desk.\" \"What is it for?\" See?\n\nL-12 Now, there, somebody might say, \"It isn't a desk. It's a board.\" Well, it is a board, but yet it's a desk. You see, there's got to be a true answer to it. And if I would ask a question about anything, there's got to be a true answer. There can be something close to it; but there's got to be a true, direct answer to every question. So, therefore, every question that comes up in our lives, there has got to be a true, correct answer.\n\nL-13 And now, today, we hear--hear it said, so many of our people in the world today... As being a missionary, have taken several trips across the sea and around the world, I've been in contact with many different religions, such as Buddha, and Mohammedan, and Sikhs, and Jains, and whatmore, of the religions of the world. And then here in our own United States; and other foreign countries, meet with all of our different churches, such as our denominational churches, beginning with the early Roman Catholic, and then to the Greek, and so forth, and the--the different rites, and then down into the... all the denominational ages, of nine hundred and something different Protestant denominations.\n\nL-14 Now, each one of them, course, you could see their idea, and I cannot blame them. Each one claims that they are the truth, they have the truth. And the people that belongs to those churches should believe that, because they have staked their--their destination, their Eternal destination, upon the teaching of that church. And they're so much different, one from the other, till it makes nine hundred and something different questions. Therefore, being nine hundred and something different questions, there's got to be one correct Answer. And I would like for us tonight, being that we're trying to go to Heaven, and to meet our Lord Jesus Who we all love, I would like to search in the Scriptures to find that.\n\nL-15 Now, if it is a Bible question, then it should have a Bible answer. It should not be able to come from a group of man, from any certain fellowship, or from some educator, or from some denomination. It should come straight from the Scripture, where God's meeting place is, of worship. And surely, being God, there is a meeting place somewhere, that He meets.\n\nL-16 Now, we find out here that in Deuteronomy here, at the beginning, Moses reciting back the Scripture, the things that he had told them; how He had brought them out with a great, strong arm, out of Egypt, and had first established them. They were called \"the people of God\" until they come out of the Egypt, and then they were called \"the church of God.\" Because, a church is a congregating, or, really, the church means \"called-out ones,\" those who have been called out. And they come out of Egypt, in order to be the church.\n\nL-17 Now God told them, when they... before they established the temple and whatever they did, \"I will choose the place of My worship, and I'll put My Name in it.\" And that's the only place that God would ever meet anybody, was by 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min His Own choosing. He chose His place. And where He chose His place, He put His Name. The 2nd verse here tells us that, \"He would put His Name in the place that He had chosen for people to worship Him in.\" Now, the thing of it is, we want to find where that place is.\n\nL-18 With nine hundred and something different ideas, being that we're bypassing all heathen religion, and just speaking of Christian religion. Which, I have a feeling for the heathens, or I certainly wouldn't be going over there and talking to them. But, they're wrong. Christianity is the only religion that's true, is Christianity. And I'm saying that not exactly because I am a Christian; because, I believe that to be the Truth. It's the only religion that's right.\n\nL-19 I've been to the grave where the white horse is changed every four hours. Where, Mohammad, a great priest and--and leader right after Christ, was supposingly to be a prophet, and, I don't doubt but what he was, right after the Maccabee brothers. But when they... He died. He claimed that he would raise again and would conquer the whole world. Now, about every four hours they change guards, and they keep a white horse at his grave. They have, for two thousand years, expecting him to rise again and conquer the world. But you see...\n\nL-20 And you go to Buddha; Buddha lived many hundred years, about twenty-three hundred years ago, the god of--of Japan. And so he was a philosopher, something like Confucius, and so forth. But all these, for... founders, and so forth, all of them died with their philosophy, and is buried and in the grave. But Christianity, which is established by Jesus Christ, there is a empty tomb. He was the only Man that ever stood on earth, and lived and said, \"I have power to lay My life down and raise it up again.\" And He did it. And He lives today. And we know He lives, because He is with us and proves Hisself by physical signs and wonders, that He promised that He would do to show it. Insomuch, as a Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel through the wilderness, it's with us today, even having Its picture taken; performing the signs and wonders that He promised It would do in this day, seeing all the Words that He promised being made manifest this day. Therefore, the rest of heathen world is out. It's Christianity!\n\nL-21 Now, being that there is nine hundred and something questions about where God meets, \"He meets with the Methodist, or He meets in the Baptist, and He meets in this, and that, and the other.\" Now, there's a question there, so everyone has to seek out his own salvation with fear and trembling. But tonight I want to try to find, and prove in the Scripture, where the correct place is where God meets and worships with the people. And, if that's it, that's the only place He'll ever meet.\n\nL-22 Now, we took this text out of Deuteronomy. It's a Greek word which has a compound meanings, or, it means, \"two laws.\" The Greek word, Deuteronomy, means \"two different laws.\" And that's just what God has, two different laws. And one of them is a law of death, and the other one is a law of Life. God has two laws. To follow Him, and serve Him and worship Him, is Life; to reject It is death. There is two laws in God.\n\nL-23 Now, one of those laws was recog-... made recognized to the world, at Mount Sinai. God gave the law to Moses and Israel. Not that the law could help them, but the law only pointed out to them that they were sinners. Until that time, they didn't know what sin was, till they had a law. There cannot be a law without a penalty. A law is not a law, without penalty. So, therefore, \"The transgression of the law is sin, and the wages of sin is death.\" So therefore, until God made them a law, there was no transgression reckoned to them. If there's no law here that says you can't run over twenty miles an hour, then you could run over twenty miles an hour. But when there's a law says you can't do it, then there's a law and a penalty behind it. [Romans 6:22-23]\n\nL-24 Now, death, the law of death, was the commandments given on Mount Sinai, which told man that he was a sinner. And, to transgress God's law, he died. But there's no salvation in the law. The... It was only a policeman that could put you in jail; it had nothing to bring you out with. But then He gave another law, that was at Mount Calvary, where sin was reckoned in Jesus Christ, and there the penalty was paid. And not with... Without law, \"but by grace you are saved,\" by the grace of God, through predestination of God's foreknowledge of your being. [Ephesians 2:5] 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min\n\nL-25 Now we see these two laws, Deuteronomy, speaking of two laws. There was two laws. One was the law of death, and the other one the law of Life.\n\nL-26 There was also two covenants give to the people. We're going to speak of them in the morning. One of them was given to Adam on condition, \"if you do this and don't do that,\" but that law was broken. Adam, Eve broke that, in the garden of Eden. Then God made the second covenant, and give that to Abraham, and that law was unconditional. \"It isn't what you've done or what you will do;\" He said, \"I have already done it.\" That's grace. That's the law of Life. God did that for Abraham and his Seed after him, that's, all of Abraham's Seed. As the Bible said, \"All Israel will be saved,\" but that don't mean Jews. As Paul said, \"That Israel which is inward, or Israel outward.\" \"Outward,\" as we spoke of the other night, it was Isaac's children, by sex. But the law of God was through Christ, which was Abraham's Royal Seed, that, \"by grace all Israel is saved.\" That's, \"All that's in Christ is saved,\" all, God's second covenant. But all these things foreshadowed Christ. [Romans 11:25-28]\n\nL-27 Now notice the 2nd verse. The 2nd verse here in Deuteronomy 16, \"Worship in the place that I have chosen.\" Now you must worship God, He said, \"In the place that I have chosen,\" not what someone else chose, but, \"what I have chosen.\" Now, if God chose a place, it behooves us then to find out what He said about it. And where is it? I want to find it, because, truly, I want to worship Him. We all are here, tonight, to worship Him. We're setting here tonight, as Methodist, Baptist, Catholic, Jehovah Witness, Christian Science, and all, but we're all seeking something. We want to know Truth. The Bible said, \"You shall know the Truth, and the Truth shall make you free.\" Somebody, you can't know what you're doing, you don't know how to do it until you know how to do it; you don't know what to do until you know how to do it, rather. You must know what you're doing and how to do it. [John 8:32]\n\nL-28 This shows us that God has a meeting place for His worshipers, in one certain place. In that place, only, God meets His worshipers.\n\nL-29 Now, also, the place He has chosen for His worshipers, He claimed He would put His Name. Now let's search out and find, through the Scripture, where this place is. Surely, if God said He would put His Name in this place where He had chosen to meet the people and worship with them... or them worship Him, rather, that it's somewhere in the Bible, for it was for all ages.\n\nL-30 And the great unchanging God cannot change. Man changes. But you can put your life upon anything that God ever said at any time, because it is Truth. It is Truth. Because, that's the only thing I can have confidence in, is the Bible. Because, man's word will fail, but God is supreme. This year I should know more than I knowed last year. You should, too, each day. We are finite, so we gain knowledge. But God is infinite. He is infinite. And, being infinite, He cannot gain knowledge. He is perfect, to begin with. Every decision has to be exactly right.\n\nL-31 And the way God acted one time, He must forever act that way, or He acted wrong when He act the first time. If a man ever come to God for salvation, upon the basis that He accepted him on, it's got to be accepted on that same basis every time. That's right. If a man ever come to God for Divine healing, and God accepted him upon a certain base; the next man comes, He's got to accept him the same way, or He did wrong when He accepted the first man. God made a basis that He would meet a man on. He made a basis what He would do, how He would do it, and that was through the sacrificial blood of a lamb in the garden of Eden. God has never, no time, ever changed it.\n\nL-32 He decided how He would save man. We've tried today to educate man into it; we tried to school them, tried to educate them, tried to denominate, tried to do all these other kinds of things; bring them in, shake them in, baptize them in, every other way there is, bring them in by letters. But still remains, the same, God meets a man under the shed Blood of the Lamb. Blood was God's way in the beginning, and Blood is God's way tonight. It's good to do penance and all these things, but salvation only comes through Blood. Blood is the only way that God chose to save man, and 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min He cannot change it.\n\nL-33 Job had the same thing. He knowed that he was a righteous, because he had offered the--the sacrifice that God had required of him.\n\nL-34 Now, let us search now to see what this place is, and the place He put His Name. We're going to have to find out where He put His Name. Then, if we find out what God's Name is and where He put it, then we've got the place of worship as soon as we find that. All these things, of course, it was shadows of things to come. All the law was foreshadowing of the things to come.\n\nL-35 Just like, the moon is a shadow of the sun. It serves in the absence of the sun, just like the Church is to serve in the absence of the S-o-n of God. In the absence of the Son, the lesser Light, the Church, the believers, serve God and give Light in the absence of the Son. But when the sun rises, you don't see the moon no more, because it's gone down. It doesn't need its light anymore, because it only gets its light secondarily, off the sun. Now, like husband and wife, the sun and moon is, Church and Christ.\n\nL-36 Now we find, that, these things being a shadow of Christ. Every sacrifice, feast, and everything in the Old Testament, foreshadowed Christ; just as the shadow strikes across the floor. Now here is where we're going to have to find the correct place of worship, is to go back here in the Old Testament where it was given and see what these things were.\n\nL-37 Now, when a shadow comes across the floor, you can tell whether it's man, woman, or beast, or whatever it might be, because it casts a shadow upon the floor. And as that shadow gets shorter, the shadow being the negative; and there cannot be a negative without a positive. Therefore, when the positive becomes closer to the negative, the negative is swallowed up in the positive. The shadow and the--and the positive comes together, and that's what makes it then the positive. And if \"all the old things,\" the Bible said, \"in the Old Testament, was shadows of the things to come,\" then therefore Christ was the shadow of things to come.\n\nL-38 So we can see, by the Old Testament types, where He chose to put His Name, and to... for now. Now, as the shadow is, a crosses the floor, I said, is the negative, being a type. So we, the worshipers, also can see the shadows of the Old Testament fading into the positive of the New.\n\nL-39 Now, all the feasts, the holidays, all the tabernacle, all the wood, everything in the tabernacle, everything typed Christ. All the offerings, all the laws, everything was in type of Christ. We've been through it, time after time, here at the tabernacle. Then we see, by these, that every creed, church, and denomination is left far behind. It's not even in the race, at all. Every creed, every church, every denomination, is completely left out. There is no place for them at all.\n\nL-40 Nothing is typed in the Old Testament, or anywhere in the Bible, of the church, but the forced unity of Babel tower. That's the only thing that types the unity. Because, it was by Nimrod, a wicked man who went out and forced all the little countries to come into one place and this great tower. It was a religious worship, of course, but not considered in the Word of God. So there is where you see denominational religion typed, the tower of Babel, in the Old Testament. Which, this religion was certainly a religion, but not the religion of the Word of God.\n\nL-41 God has not chosen to put His Name in any denomination. I want the Scripture for it, if it is. I know they claim He has, but He hasn't. He cannot put His Name in many places, because He said He put His Name in one place. And, that one place, each one of our denomination wants to say they are that place, but it's contrary. But where did He put His Name?\n\nL-42 Now, and, He, what is His Name, first? We'll have to (Name) find what God's Name is before we can find what it is He is putting in the place. Now, we find out that He had many titles. He is called the... He was called \"Father,\" which is a title. And He was called \"Son,\" which is a title. He was called \"Holy Ghost,\" which is a title. He was called \"Rose of Sharon,\" which is a title. \"Lily of the Valley,\" a title, \"Morning Star.\" \"Jehovah-jireh, Jehovah-rapha,\" seven different, compound, redemptive 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min names, and all of them were titles. None of them were names. But He has a Name.\n\nL-43 When He met Moses, He had not a Name yet, and He told Moses, \"I AM THAT I AM.\" And when we see Jesus on earth, speaking in Hebrews the 6th chapter... I beg your pardon, Saint John the 6th chapter. He said, \"I AM THAT I AM.\" They said, \"Why, You're a Man not over fifty years old, and say that You 'seen Abraham'?\" [Exodus 3:14]\n\nL-44 He said, \"Before Abraham was, I AM.\" And \"I AM\" was the One, the burning bush, the Pillar of Fire that was in the burning bush back in the days of Moses, the \"I AM THE I AM.\" [John 8:58]\n\nL-45 And now we find out that Jesus said, also, \"I came in My Father's Name, and you received Me not.\" Then, the Name of the Father must be Jesus. That's right. The Name of the Father is Jesus, 'cause Jesus said so. \"I carry My Father's Name. I come in My Father's Name, and you received Me not. Then, His Name was Jesus. And Gabriel called Him Jesus, the prophets called Him Jesus, and He was absolutely Jesus. Before His birth, even the holy prophet called His Name Emmanuel, which is, \"God with us.\" Then, \"God was manifested in the flesh, in order to take away the sin of the world,\" and, in doing so, He was given the Name of Jesus. So, Jesus is the Name. And the Name was placed in a Man; not a church, not a denomination, not a creed, but a Man! He chose to place His Name in Jesus Christ. Now we find out that then He becomes the place of God's worship, where you worship Him. [John 5:43], [Isaiah 7:14]\n\nL-46 Ever before He was even born, His Name was called Jesus. It was so important, it was give to His mother by the Angel Gabriel, that His Name would be called \"Jesus, Son of God,\" what He was. [Luke 1:31]\n\nL-47 There we have it, then. This is it, alone. It is, for Him alone, God's chosen place of worship. God's place, chose. God chose to meet man; was not in a church, not in a denomination, not in a creed, but in Christ. That's the only place that God will meet a man, and he can worship God, is in Christ. That's the only place. No matter if you're Methodist, Baptist, Catholic, Protestant, whatever you might be, there is only one place that you can correctly worship God, that's in Christ. Romans 8:1, said, \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, that walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\" That's the Gospel. [Romans 8:1]\n\nL-48 We can different upon creeds. We can different upon man-made theories. You can go to a Methodist church, you have to be a Methodist; a Baptist, a Baptist; a Catholic, a Catholic. But when once you're baptized into Christ, and become a member of His Body, there is no differences. The middle walls of partition is tore down and you are free, because you're in Christ Jesus. And you worship God in Spirit and in Truth when you are in Christ Jesus. It's God's plan for you to worship Him in Christ Jesus.\n\nL-49 Now, no church denomination can claim this, no one can claim that. How dare you to make such claims? To do such a thing would be an antichrist spirit, be taking away from Christ; to take from Him. You cannot do that. Christ is the only place that God meets the worshipers.\n\nL-50 They say, today. I've had people to tell me. A man called me not long ago, in Beaumont, Texas. He said, \"Mr. Branham, if your name is not on our church book, you cannot go to Heaven.\" Would you ever think of that? Don't you believe such a thing as that. They think you have to belong to that certain church or you cannot go to Heaven. That's wrong. To believe that, is antichrist. I'll say this: if you believe such a spirit, you're lost. That's a good sign you are lost, because it's taking away from what God did. God never put His Name in any church. He put It in His Son, Christ Jesus, when He and His Son became One. That's the genuine place of worship. No other foundations was laid, no other rock. On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; All other grounds is sinking sands. Denominations will crumble and fall, nations will pass away, but He will remain forever. No other place that a man can find, to worship God, that God will speak back to him, no place but in Christ Jesus. That's the only place, the only place that God chose to put His Name, and the only place that He meets man, to worship. You're lost, to believe 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min anything else.\n\nL-51 Notice, all seven Jewish feasts was kept in the same place. They never kept one feast here for the Methodist, and one over here for the Baptist, one over there for the Presbyterian, one back here for the Catholic, and one for the Protestant. All seven feasts was kept in the same place.\n\nL-52 It's a very beautiful type here. We've just went through the Seven Church Ages, going to show that God keep all Seven Church Ages in the Word, for each church age produced a part of the Word, and whenever they produced it and they saw the Light. Just like the people who first discovered to baptize in Jesus' Name. What did they do? They made a denomination out of it, and it died right there. Then God moved right out into somebody else. He will not stay in one of those creeds and dogmas. He has nothing to do with it. There is nothing perverted about God. God's Word is holy, unadulterated. Christ is God's center spot of worship. He is God.\n\nL-53 All seven feasts must be kept in this one place. You couldn't keep the feast in any other place. But them seven, place... The seven feasts of the year must be kept in one place. Therefore, the Seven Church Ages had to come from the one single place, that was Christ speaking in all Seven Church Ages. That's exactly right. Type, of the Seven Church Ages, but they made denominations out of it.\n\nL-54 Now let's look at another type while we're along here, that's, the type of the passover, foreshadowed Jesus. We notice here the sacrifice of blood, by death. The sacrifice of blood was the place that foreshadowed Christ. Can a denomination bleed; could you think of a church bleeding, a denominational bleeding? Certainly not. It taken blood, to bleed from a life. And, the life, here Jesus comes in view by the lamb. The lamb was a type of Christ, and foreshadowed Christ, because He was \"the Lamb of God,\" that John introduced, \"that takes away the sin of the world.\" We find Jesus coming into view, here in Exodus the 12th chapter.\n\nL-55 Notice, it was the only place death could not strike. When death was about to strike the land, there had to be a certain place; all from under this died. Only one place! Now, it didn't mean it was one house; but there was one place, that's where the lamb was killed. Where the lamb's blood was, the death angel could not strike, because it was the one place God had put His Name. And that lamb was named back there in the beginning, a lamb. Notice, it was the one place he could not strike.\n\nL-56 And now the same is today. There is only one place that spiritual death cannot strike, that's the Word. Death can't strike the Word, because It's the living Word of God. But when you put creeds with It, the Word moves out to Itself. It'll separate like water from oil. You cannot mix it together. Therefore, you see, when the creed comes into a denomination, they all go after the creed; and the Word dies out, and goes on with somebody else and increases It more. Picks up the momentum, as It go from justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, and on out into the Grain! Do you see the path God has trod? Bringing His Name, all the time, right down the same way, because He is the Word. Notice, It can't die. The Word of Life can't die.\n\nL-57 Notice how perfect, now. The death angel was not forbidden to strike Egypt's great intellectual people. It wasn't forbidden to strike its sacred lands, its great buildings, its pharaohs. Or, the priests of the land, the angel was not forbidden to strike. It could strike any building, any place, anybody, but it could not strike where the lamb was. Death cannot strike where this provided place of God is, and that is in the Lamb.\n\nL-58 Notice, not even was the... he forbidden to strike Israel or its Hebrew priests, and, or any of their denominations. All must be in God's chosen, provided place, or death struck.\n\nL-59 Church, wherever you are, what you belong to, makes me no difference. But, there's one thing you must know, you've got to be in Christ or you're dead. You can't live outside of Him. Your church might be alright, as a building; your fellowship might be alright, as man. But when you deny the Body, the Blood, the Word of Jesus Christ, you're dead the minute you do it. It's God's chosen place of worship. There is where His Name is, exactly. There is where He chose to put His Name; not in the church, but in the Son, Jesus Christ. 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min\n\nL-60 Notice, safety lied only in the place of His choosing, in His lamb, and in the name of the lamb.\n\nL-61 Notice, it was a \"male\" lamb, a he, not a her. Not a church, she; but His Name, not her name. Where He was going to meet the people was not in her name, but in His Name, Him, the Lamb!\n\nL-62 Now we say, \"The church, the great, mighty church, she did this and she did that. She has weighed the storms. We've picked up in population. We're great in numbers. We're a mighty church. She is a great thing.\" But God never said anything about a she. He said, \"Him.\" \"Him,\" is the meeting place, the Lamb, not the church. Not her name, but His Name. He didn't put her name anywhere. He put His Name in \"Him\"! That's why, \"All we must do, or word or deed, we must do it all in the Name of Jesus Christ.\" If we pray, we got to pray in the Name of Jesus. If we ask petition, we've got to ask in Jesus' Name. If we walk, we walk in Jesus' Name. If we talk, we talk in Jesus' Name. If we baptize, we've got to baptize in the Name of Jesus Christ. For, \"All that we do in word or in deed, do it in the Name of Jesus Christ.\"\n\nL-63 A fellow said to me one time, discussing that, he said, \"Brother Branham, my wife, I don't...\" He said, \"She, her name is Such-and-such.\" He's a minister, may be setting here now. And he said, \"My wife,\" said, \"she's got my name.\" I'll just say Jones, because it wasn't Jones. He said, \"Now, she don't have to get up every morning, get the broom and say, 'Now I sweep the floor in the name of Jones, and I wash the dishes in the name of Jones, and I patch the clothes in the name of Jones.'\" He said, \"I don't think you have to call any name at all.\" I said, \"I believe you do.\" That's right. And he said, \"Well, why? She don't have to say it. Everything she does is in the name of Jones, to begin with.\"\n\nL-64 I say, \"But you never walked down on a street and got her, and said, 'Come on, Jones.' She had to become, first, by a ceremony, a marriage ceremony, 'Jones.' If she didn't, you're living in adultery. And if you're baptized any other way but in the Name of Jesus Christ, it's an adultery baptism, which is not found in the Bible.\" Then, \"What you do in word and deed, do it all in the Name of Jesus,\" after that, what you do. But first you have to come in His Name.\n\nL-65 There is many fine women in this building tonight, fine, loyal women; but there's one Mrs. William Branham. She's the one goes home with me. She's the one that's my wife.\n\nL-66 There is fine people in the world, fine churches; but there's one Mrs. Jesus Christ, and that's who He's coming for. That's where His Name lays. There is where His worship is, in Her and Her alone. That is true. Oh, yes, sir. We find that to be true.\n\nL-67 Now, that's why, we, \"All we do in word or in deed, we do it in the Name of Jesus Christ.\" \"There is not another name given under Heaven for salvation, but the Name of Jesus Christ.\" Acts, the 2nd chapter, says that, \"For be it known unto you...\" \"There's not another name given under Heaven whereby a man must be saved, only in the Name of Jesus Christ.\" Amen. I hope you get it. The Name of Jesus Christ, every... Highest Heaven is named Him, \"All the family in Heaven is named Jesus,\" the Bible said, \"and all the family on earth is named Jesus.\" So that's God's chosen Name and where He has put It. That's His place of worship, is in Jesus Christ. Now, we know that to be so, no other place to worship but in Him. [Acts 4:12]\n\nL-68 \"There is no another name under Heaven given among man, whereby they must be saved.\" His is God's Name of redemption. God has a name called Jehovah-jireh, Jehovah-rapha, Jehovah-jireh. \"The Lord forgives all thy sins.\" Jehovah-rapha, \"the Lord heals all thy diseases.\" He had many titles. But He's got one Name of Redemption, that belongs to the human race, and that is the Name of \"Jesus.\" That's His Name, He chose to put. Where did He put It? He put It in Christ.\n\nL-69 All other church names, creeds, titles, is death to trust them. You're trusting the Methodist church to take you to Heaven, you're lost. If you're trusting the Pentecostals, the Pentecostal church to take you to Heaven, you're lost. And the Baptist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Catholic, any other church; you're trusting their name, or their title, or their creed, you are lost. Because, you can't even worship until first you come into the place of worship. Amen. That's the only place God meets 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min the worshiper, is the place He chose to put His Name. All others, you trust in them, you'll die. He also...\n\nL-70 Another shadow of Jesus here, I've got marked down, the Scripture. Also, He--He foreshadowed here, \"He must be without a blemish.\" The place He puts His Name, this lamb must be without a blemish. Now, what denomination or system can you pin this to; what church, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, whatever it is? What system, denomination, can you pin that to, \"without a blemish on it\"? It's all rejected, and refused! But there is a place! Hallelujah! That place is in Jesus Christ. There is not a blemish on Him. There is no fault in Him. You cannot pin this. All these people that try to do so, say their church is without fault and all this. It's filthy, Word-breakers, lovers, half dead, Laodicean, creed, but it is not the Truth. But even Pilate himself, His enemy, said, \"I can find no fault in Him.\" His Own enemy testified there was no fault in Him. You can't pin any sin on Him. [John 18:38], [John 19:4]\n\nL-71 He said to the priests of His days, \"Which one of you can accuse Me of sin? Who can show Me that I'm a sinner?\" Tell me one church that can say they never did do anything wrong. Frankly, there is not a one of them, hardly, but what's murdered and done everything there is on the calendar to do, hardly. Then still call themself... No, it's not God's meeting place of worship, in any creed or denomination. [John 8:46]\n\nL-72 My friends, I don't want to hurt feelings, but I am responsible for a Message, and, that Message is, \"Come out of this mess!\" And if I ask you to come out, where am I going to take you to? Would I take you to the Branham Tabernacle? It's as much fault as any of the rest of them. But there's one place I can take you to, where you're safe and protected from death, that's in Jesus Christ, God's place of worship. That's the place I'm introducing to you, tonight, where God put His Name. Where He promised He would meet every person that come in there, He would worship with him and feast with him, that's in Christ; not in no church, no tabernacle. But, in Christ, He is God's Tabernacle. He is the place that God came into, Himself, and dwelt in Him. \"This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am pleased to dwell in.\" There is where God tabernacled, brought His Name and placed It upon, Jesus Christ. Therefore, His Name was put in a Man, His Son, Jesus Christ, in which He tabernacled Himself, and in that Tabernacle. Where, in a type, the old Jerusalem, the old feasts, the old temple, was a type; when the smoke come in, the day that the ark went in, of the covenant, and settled down, and the Voice of God was heard from it. So did the Voice of God be heard, coming into the Tabernacle, Jesus Christ; which, the Old (natural) was a type and a shadow of the New. And when He come into Christ, He said, \"This is My Beloved Son, in Whom I'm pleased to dwell in. And I'll choose the place where I'll put My Name, and where I will meet man, and where I will worship at.\" God chose the place; not in no church denomination, but in Jesus Christ. Yes, sir. [Matthew 17:5]\n\nL-73 He must also be \"without a blemish,\" as I said. No denomination can claim that. They do; they're antichrist.\n\nL-74 Now we find out here, notice His shadow again. The--the lamb is to be kept up. Now, this is found in Exodus 12, if you're marking it down, Exodus 12:3 to 6. The lamb must be kept up four days, to be tried, to see if it's worthy to go to the sacrifice yet. Must be took, examined over and over, for four days, to see if there's a blemish on it, see if there's any sickness in it, see if there's anything wrong with the lamb. It must be kept up four days. [Exodus 12:3-6]\n\nL-75 Now notice. Some of you might have thought that was a little bit, killed on the fourteenth. But, you remember, they took the lamb on the tenth day of the month, and killed it on the fourteenth day of the month, see, which was kept up for four days.\n\nL-76 Now, Jesus, God's Name, Lamb, went into Jerusalem and never came out again until after His death, burial, and resurrection. He was kept up under critics for four days and four nights. How perfect that Lamb was typed, kept up for four days. That's when Pilate said, \"I can find no fault in Him.\"\n\nL-77 Another shadow of Him, no bone could be broken in Him, which was perfectly, when they couldn't. In killing the sacrifice, they couldn't break a bone. If it was, it was refused. And they already drawed the hammer back to break the bones in the legs of Christ, when they said, \"He's already dead.\" They pierced His side and found Blood and water. 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min\n\nL-78 Notice again another great thing here. I wouldn't skip it by, because He was represented in the offerings, the meal offering. I remember one time they had a school, in the Bible, called the school of the prophets, and it was quite a school. And we find out that Elijah went up there to that school one day, and they said, \"We...\" They prayed him to leave, said, \"When you're around here, things are too straight.\" So they wanted him to get away. And they went out to get him a dinner. And a bunch of the priests went out, or prophets, to get some peas, to make a dinner for him. And when they did, they gathered a great big apronful of them; and when they come back, it was wild gourds, which was poison, and they throwed them into the pot. And the pots begin to boil, and they, somebody, said, \"Alas, there is death in the pot. Now we can't even eat.\" And Elijah said, \"Bring me a handful of meal.\" And he took the meal and threw it into the pot, and said, \"Eat. The pot is healed.\" [II Kings 4:40-41]\n\nL-79 The meal offering was Christ. Every burr had to be set the same, and every little piece of meal had to be ground the same, for the meal offering. Showing, that, He is the healer. He substitutes, and takes away death, and puts Life; by the two laws. Hallelujah! Where death is, one place; when Christ comes in, Life comes in. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And where there was death, there became Life, because that Christ was brought in, the meal offering.\n\nL-80 What a great lessons that these things would be if we take time to break them out! Now notice, not one word of the shadows fail. Not one word ever failed, of the shadow. Everything typed perfectly. He is God's chosen place of worship, and God's Name is given to Him. He is God's place of worship, and God's Name is given to Him. He is the Word of God, and He is the Name of God. He is both the Word of God and the Name of God. \"He was the Word made flesh.\" He was the Word of God, Lamb of God, Name of God, and was God. That's what He was, the chosen and only place of worship to God.\n\nL-81 And God refuses any other place besides in Jesus Christ; you cannot worship Him anywhere. He said, \"In vain they do worship Me, teaching for Doctrine the commandments of man.\" Today we have creeds, dogmas, and everything, that teaches this is the way and that is the way. And Jesus said, \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and no man can come to God except by Me.\" In other words, \"I am the Door to the sheepfold. All without are thieves.\" He is the only approach. He is the Door. He is the Way, the Truth, the Life, all that there is; the only entrance, the only place, the only worship, the only Name. Everything is tied to Jesus Christ. All the Old Testament is tied to Him. The New Testament tied to Him. And the Church today is tied to Him, by the Word of His commandment. There is not another place, or another Name, or anywhere, where God ever promised to meet a man; only in Jesus Christ, His chosen place of worship. [Matthew 15:9], [John 14:6], [John 10:1]\n\nL-82 Notice, God has promised to meet His worshipers in only this one place, and that is of His Own choosing; not of our choosing, not of our thinking; but of His thinking, His choosing. And it would be the place where He put His Name, where He chose. So we find out that we find where His Name was, what He chose, by His Own choosing.\n\nL-83 Now that we have found the place He put His Name, that is, in Christ Jesus, and there is no other place, or no other name, are you satisfied of that? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now, the thing of it is, if we find where the place is... The worship place is nowhere accepted, only in Christ. You can repent, you can do that, but you're not worshiping yet. You're asking for pardon. Peter said... On the Day of Pentecost, when they seen them all speaking with tongues, and great signs and wonders taking place, they begin to laugh, the church did, and said, \"These man are full of new wine. They act like drunk people. The...\" Mary the virgin, all of them, was together, hundred and twenty of them. And they were staggering like drunk man, and speaking in tongues, and carrying on. They said, \"These man are full of new wine.\" [Acts 2:13-15]\n\nL-84 But Peter, standing up, said, \"Men and brethren, these men are not full of new wine, for this is just the third hour of the day. But this is that which was spoke of by the prophet Joel, 'And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I'll pour out My Spirit upon all flesh; your sons and daughters shall prophesy; upon My handmaids and maidservant 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min will I pour out of My Spirit. I'll show signs in the heavens above, and on earth; fire, pillars of fire, vapors of smoke. It shall come to pass, before the great and terrible Day of the Lord shall come, that whosoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord shall be saved.\"' [Joel 3:8], [Acts 2:17]\n\nL-85 When they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said, \"Men and brethren, what can we do?\"\n\nL-86 Peter said, \"Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is that all future generations.\" Now we find that. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-87 Now we want to find how we get into Him. How do we get into this place of worship? First Corinthians 12 settles it, for, \"By one Spirit!\" Not by one church, not by one creed, not by one pastor, not by one bishop, not by one priest. But, \"By one Holy Spirit we are all baptized into one Body,\" which is the Body of Jesus Christ, and subject to every gift that lays in that Body. Yes, sir! No joining, no reciting of creeds, no pumping up, letting down, handshaking, or nothing else. But, by Birth we are baptized into the Body of Jesus Christ! Amen. \"By one Holy Spirit we are all baptized into one Body.\" [I Corinthians 12:13]\n\nL-88 And what is that Body? \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\" How can we be in that Body and deny one Word of It, or place It off somewhere else that It's not even in the Body? How can we ever do it? God's chosen place! [John 1:1, 14]\n\nL-89 Notice, and when you are truly baptized into Him, the true evidence is that you believe Him, the Word. How can you be a part of Him and then deny Him? How can I deny my hand being my hand? If there... If I do, there is something mentally wrong with me. And how can I? If there is something mentally wrong with me, deny that's my hand, deny that's my foot, there is something spiritually wrong with the believer that denies any Word that God ever said and promised. There is something spiritually wrong with that so-called believer.\n\nL-90 You can't deny one letter of Him, because you have become a part of the same. You are a part of Him because you're baptized into Him; by, the Holy Spirit has brought you into the Body of Jesus Christ. What a beautiful thing!\n\nL-91 God had a certain place He met--He met Abraham, and there Abraham worshiped. All down through the Testament! And His promised Word will be interpreted in you, by Him. Did you get that? The Word that He promised to fulfill in the day that you're living in, you will be a written epistle of God, read of all man. Not what you claim, but what God does through you, will speak out louder than anything you could claim. God said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\" That speaks through you.\n\nL-92 He spoke of this age, what would be now. The believers of this age has to believe This, what He promised today. Just the same as they had to come into the ark, to be saved; go out of Egypt to be saved; they have to come into Christ, to be saved now, into the Word Message, that He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\n\nL-93 How do you get into It? By baptism! Baptism of what, water? By the Holy Ghost! \"One Spirit, we're all baptized into this one Body.\"\n\nL-94 And His promised Word, He will not... You won't have to interpret It. He will interpret It through you; what you are doing, what He promised to do. The Church that follows Him will be so much like Him until the people will know. Look at Peter and John when they was questioned about healing a man at the gate called Beautiful. They said, \"They perceived,\" those priests did, \"that they were both ignorant and unlearned man,\" but they take notice that they had been with Jesus. Because, (what?) they were doing the things that He did.\n\nL-95 He must be about the Father's business. And today it must be the same.\n\nL-96 Now, remember, He's the same yesterday, today, and forever; for God meets you in Him, the only place there is; for that is where He has chosen to put His Name, in Jesus. \"Jesus\" is the Name of God. Remember, Father, Son, Holy Ghost, is titles to the Name \"Jesus Christ.\" [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-97 When Matthew said, \"Go ye therefore, teach all nations, baptizing them into the Name of the Father, of the Son, 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min and of the Holy Ghost.\" How it's been misinterpreted today, and say, \"In the name of the Father, name of the Son, name of the Holy Ghost.\" It's not even written. It's, \"In the Name,\" singular, \"of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost.\" Father is not a name, Son is not a name, Holy Ghost is not a name; it's a title. Ten days later, Peter stood up and said, \"Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ.\" Then did he do what He told him not to do? He did what He told him to do. The Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is \"the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Every person in the New Testament was baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Matthew 28:19], [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-98 Not one person in the Bible was ever baptized in the titles of Father, Son, Holy Ghost. That never did come into existence until the Nicaea creed was put on at Nicaea, Rome. It was an order of the Catholic church, found, vindicated the same thing, in the catechism. I've got it, that's right, Facts Of Our Faith, and so forth, that it absolutely is a Roman Catholic creed. They'll tell you it's not in the Bible; but they say they have power to change them Words, if they wish to, because of the pope. I different. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. \"And whosoever shall take one Word out of this Bible,\" said Jesus, \"or put one word in It, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.\" One Word; not a sentence, or a paragraph, but a Word! \"Whosoever shall take one Word...\" [Revelation 22:19]\n\nL-99 In the beginning, God fortified His people with His Word. One Word, misconstrued, caused every death, every heartache, every sorrow. Eve, she never broke a sentence; she broke a Word. When Jesus come in the middle of the Book... That was the first of the Book. When Jesus come in the middle of the Book, what'd He say? \"It is written that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" In the last of the Book, Revelations the 22nd chapter, the 18th verse, the very last part of the Bible, Jesus speaks Himself, said, \"I testify that if any man shall take one Word out of this Book, or add one word to It, his part will be taken out of the Book of Life,\" because he's a false prophet and has misconstrued the people, and their blood will be accounted to his hand, of doing so. [Revelation 22:18]\n\nL-100 We must keep that one place of worship, that is, Jesus Christ the Word, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. All right. Remember, there is no other meeting place to worship, not a place. God chose It.\n\nL-101 John, way back yonder at the tie between the New and Old Testament. Listen close now. Notice closely. John, that great eagle, come flying from the wilderness one day, his great wings spread. He lit down on the bank of the Jordan, a great eagle prophet that bridged the way between the Old and New Testament, and he called them from right and left. He was calling a day of repentance. Where come the Pharisees and Sadducees out; he said, \"Don't begin to say within yourself, 'We have Abraham to our father,' 'cause I tell you God is able of these stones to rise children to Abraham.\" Oh, my! When he begin to throw his Gospel out, and saying, \"There stands One among you, Who you don't know. I've not yet identified Him, but I'll know Him when He comes. I'm not worthy to loose His shoe. But He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire. And His fan is in His hand; He'll thoroughly purge His floor, and He'll burn the chaff with unquenchable Fire.\" [Matthew 3:9], [Luke 3:16], [Mark 1:7], [John 1:26-27]\n\nL-102 That great Gospel eagle setting there, as he crowed out his great threats. And the filth come out, or Herod, the emperor at that time, proclamator, married his brother's wife. And could you imagine that big Gospel eagle setting there and holding his peace at that? Some of them said, \"Don't you preach on marriage and divorce now, John, 'cause there sets Herod.\"\n\nL-103 He walked right up in his face and said, \"It's not lawful for you to have her.\" Right! What, he, was it? He was that eagle from the wilderness. He wasn't trained under man's scares and threats, of some denomination. But he was trained under the power of Almighty God, to know what would be there. He knowed the identification of the Messiah. Hallelujah! The word means, \"Praise our God!\" Don't get scared. I've never hurt nobody yet. I am not excited. I know 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min right where I am. Oh, when I think of him, that big eagle flying out there and setting down! He said, \"I'll know Him when He comes.\" [Matthew 14:4]\n\nL-104 One day he was standing there, a preaching. The priests was across the other side, said, \"You mean there'll come a time the daily sacrifice will be taken away; this great temple that we've built, and all the work we put on, us big denomination?\" He said, \"There'll come a time when all that'll be done away.\" \"It can't be. You're a false prophet!\"\n\nL-105 And he looked around. He said, \"Behold, there He is! There's God's chosen place of worship. There's the Lamb, the real Lamb that takes away the sin of the world.\" He didn't say, \"Here comes the Methodist, here comes the Baptist, or the Catholic.\" He said, \"There comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.\" The only safety zone there is is in that Lamb of God. In Him alone is salvation; not in any church, any creed, any people, any father, any mother, any holy man, or nothing, holy place. It's in the Holy God, the Lord Jesus Christ, where God placed His Name on a human Being, for redemption, Who paid the price for us sinners. That's the only place that there is salvation. That's the Rock I stand on.\n\nL-106 John identified Him. He said, \"I didn't know Him when I saw Him come walking up, but out there where I got my schooling...\" Not in the seminary like his daddy did; not as a priest, trained. But in the wilderness, where he was in the theological seminary of Almighty God, waiting for God's Word; not what some group of man had hatched up, but what God had said about It. And when John looked up and saw the Spirit coming, he said, \"I bear record, this is Him.\" Oh, my! There is your place of worship. There is your hiding place. There is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. Not no church, no creed, or nothing else, but the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. [John 1:15-17, 25-34]\n\nL-107 See how John placed it? He didn't say, \"You Pharisees is right, you Sadducees, Herodians.\" He said, \"There is the Lamb.\" That's the place. He has got the Name. He is the One. Not another name under Heaven!\n\nL-108 Watch what Jesus said about John now. One day John sent to Him, to see what He was doing. Jesus said of him, \"He was that great and shining light,\" to show them the right path that they should follow before His advent, His first advent. Listen close. Don't miss it. Jesus said, \"John was that light.\" Malachi 3, no mistake! The prophet with the great shining light identified Jesus as being the only One, \"the Lamb.\" All other lambs them priests was talking about, and all them other things, was foolish. Here was \"the Lamb!\" The man with the great shining light, that Jesus said he was. [John 1:19-37] Malachi 3 said, \"I'll send My messenger before My face to prepare the way.\" And the one that was sent to prepare the way, identified Him, the place. \"That's Him! There's no mistake. That's Him! I see the sign following Him. I know that that's Him; a Light coming down from Heaven and going upon Him.\" It was positive, that was Him. [Malachi 3:1], [Malachi 3:1]\n\nL-109 Then, my brother, I want to ask you something, in closing. We might say this. In Malachi 4, aren't we also promised another eagle, a Pillar of Light to be following, to show the erring church this day that He is Hebrews 13:8, \"the same yesterday, today, and forever\"? Aren't we promised another one to come flying from the wilderness? Amen! That's exactly the Truth. How fitting and matching it is to Luke 17:30, where the Son of man (Eagle) will be revealing Himself to bring to naught all other worship places, such as denominations and so forth! God chose His place. John said, \"There It is!\" [Malachi 4:5-6], [Hebrews 13:8], [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-110 And then we're promised the same thing in this day, Malachi 4, \"To turn the hearts of the children back,\" to say that He is not dead, these things are not for another age; baptism in Jesus' Name was not for back there, but He is now the same. Amen. To bring to naught all other places of worship, that's what the last-day eagle is to do, to show that all the rest of it is foolishness, denomination is folly, but to point them again with the same sign that he did, that He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Hallelujah! [Malachi 4:5-6] 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min\n\nL-111 Also, in Revelations 4:7, we had four Beasts that we've just been through with. The first one was, we've found out, was the lion. That was the first Beast that went forth to meet the challenge of that day, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah. After Him come the next Beast. And we find out, the next Beast was an ox, which is a beast of burden, a sacrifice. In the days of the Roman cathedral, the Church died out; sacrifice. The next come, was a man, was a Beast with a face of a man. And that man was the reformers, man's education, theology, and so forth. But the last Beast that was to fly, the last Beast that was to come, the Bible said it was a flying eagle. Hallelujah! And the prophet said, in this day, \"It shall be Light.\" Oh, my! \"In that day there will be Light.\" [Revelation 4:7]\n\nL-112 There is been a day of reformers. There is been a day that's just a shadow, can't call day or night. But in the evening time, in the Eagle time: It shall be Light about Eagle time, The path to Glory you will surely find; In the water way is the Light today, Buried in the precious Name of Jesus. Young and old, repent of all your sins, The Holy Ghost will surely baptize you in; For the evening Lights have come, It is a fact that God and Christ are One.\n\nL-113 Amen! It shall be Light about the evening time, God's only chosen place to worship. Oh, what's this Message come to, what is He going to do? And in his day it shall be Light at the evening time, and (what?) to welcome His children back home to the true promised Land, by the same sign of the Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel through the wilderness. [Zechariah 14:7] God's chosen place to worship, Jesus Christ. That's the only place there is. That's the only Name God has for salvation. That's what He has named the family in Heaven, when it's on earth, is Jesus Christ. [Deuteronomy 6:1-3], [Philippians 2:6-11]\n\nL-114 O church, O people, sinner friend, don't trust in nothing else but Jesus Christ. Don't trust in any preacher. Don't trust in anybody else to save you. Trust not in any church, any creed, any denomination. Trust only in Jesus Christ, for He is the Light of the hour. [Philippians 2:6-11] Let us bow our heads. It shall be Light about the evening time, The path to Glory you will surely find; In the water way is the Light today, Buried in the precious Name of Jesus. Young and old, repent of all your sins, The Holy Ghost will surely enter in; The evening Lights have come, It is the facts that God and Christ are One.\n\nL-115 Oh, brother, sister, if you haven't repented yet, if you haven't been baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, would you make that start tonight? Would you give God the opportunity to welcome you into the place where you can worship Him? Remember, outside of there, there is no place that God promised to meet you and welcome your worship. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-116 You say, \"Brother Branham, I worship just as sincere!\" So did Cain. He made every kind of an offering that Abel did, but it was the wrong offering. You might go to church, and pay your tithes, and do your duty as a Christian ought to, just as sincere as any man or woman. [Hebrews 11:4] I've stood here now for some thirty years, around the city here, and screamed this same Message. I'm getting old. I can't 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min be with you too much longer. But remember, in the Day of Judgment, my voice is recorded, and it'll speak out against you.\n\nL-117 There is only one place that God puts His Name, and that's not in a church, but in Jesus. There is only one place of worship, only one place that you are received, and that is in the Beloved, Jesus Christ. \"There is not another name under Heaven, given among men, whereby be saved,\" no church, no creed, no nothing. Jesus Christ! And that's supposed to be the Message of the hour, \"To restore back the hearts of the children, back to the Faith that was once delivered to the saints.\" Won't you accept It tonight? And while we have our heads bowed. [Acts 4:12], [Malachi 4:5-6], [Philippians 2:6-11]\n\nL-118 And those that would like to be remembered in prayer, would you just raise your hands. We can't make an altar call, because it's just too many. God bless you. My! On my left, I guess there is three hundred.\n\nL-119 Now to my right, would you raise your hands, say, \"I want to be remembered.\" I guess there's a hundred and fifty, or more, on my right. We have a tabernacle down here with a big pool of water; a pastor, a fine pastor, Brother Orman Neville, associates, these man around here that you see and meet. Every day, every night, every hour, people that wants to be baptized, that's repented, it's always waiting. And if you'll obey that commandment, you are sure, by a promise of God, if you're sincere in your heart, to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost.\n\nL-120 There is only one place of worship. Now, that isn't in the tabernacle. That's in Christ. How do we get into Him? \"By one Spirit we're all baptized into this one Body.\" Let us pray.\n\nL-121 Dear God, as these hands went up, they signified what was beneath that hand in the heart, a conviction that they are sure they need help from You. I pray for each of them, Father. And I'm going to quote Your Word. You said, \"He that heareth My Word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life, and shall not come to the Judgment; but has passed from death unto Life.\" Father, just being gone from the city a few weeks, come back, asked, \"About this one?\" \"Why, they're gone.\" \"Well, what about...\" \"They're gone.\" [John 5:24]\n\nL-122 Dear God, one by one we are called, one by one we have to meet the challenge to walk down through the valley of the shadow of death. And it's due to every one of us, as mortals. But, tonight, You have offered us Your petition, that if we would believe on Him and be baptized in His Name, that You would take us in. And then in this Body, the Body of Christ, not in the church; but in the Body of Christ, that Body has already been judged. It will not have to come to Judgment. God poured out His wrath upon that body, and that body is free from sin; and, being in Him, puts us free from sin, by His Atonement that died for us. And in there we have fellowship with one another, while the Blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, keeps us clean from all sin and defilement. [Psalms 23:4], [Psalms 20:4-6]\n\nL-123 Father, God, I pray that You will take each of them into Your Kingdom. Grant it, God. May there not be a one of them lost; may there be not a boy or girl, man or woman. Lord, some of my own people is setting here, tonight, that's out from under that Blood. How well I can remember my daddy's words! And I pray, Dear God, that none of them will be lost. Grant it, Lord. I'm believing You now, with all that I have to believe with.\n\nL-124 Move upon my brothers, sisters, my friends, here in this place tonight and out yonder by the phone. Several different states listening in, all the way from the East Coast to the West. I pray, Dear God, way down across the deserts there in Tucson, way over in California, up in Nevada and Idaho, way over in the East and around, down in Texas; while this invitation is given, people setting in--in little churches, filling stations, homes, listening in. O God, may that lost man or woman, boy or girl, at this hour, come to Thee. Grant it just now. We ask it in Jesus' Name, that they'll find this safety place while it is time. When, we see the handwriting on the wall, the earth getting nervous, the time of deliverance is at hand. Part of our nation is sinking, the other part rolling and bursting with earthquakes, as Jesus promised would be. Let it not be too long for them, Lord. May they accept it now, for we present them to You as trophies of the meeting, of the Gospel, in Jesus' Name. Amen. [Daniel 5:5-6] 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min\n\nL-125 Do you believe Him? God bless you. How many believes that's the Truth, to my left, raise your hand. How many to the right, raise your hand. God bless you. As far as I see, every one. That's Truth, friends. God knows that's true.\n\nL-126 Now while in Him, and being in Him, you have access to everything He died for. And what did He die for? \"He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquity; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we were healed.\" Do you believe that? Do you believe in His atonement for healing now? [Romans 5:1-2], [Ephesians 2:12-20], [Ephesians 3:10-12]\n\nL-127 Is there any sick among us? Let them raise their hands, right or left. Great crowds of sickness. I can't call the line. You see, I haven't... can't come up on the platform. There is no way of doing it. They're having prayer meetings out in the other places, for the sick, in the churches and things, down in the tabernacle. I'm going to ask you something. How many believers is there? Raise your hand. All right. I'm going to quote to you the Word, which is Christ. Jesus' last commission to the world, and to the Church, rather, He said this, \"These signs shall follow them that believe; if they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" How many knows that's true, Mark 16, say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] All right. I'm asking you as a believer to lay hands on somebody in front of you. Just lay your hands over on somebody in front of you, and let's each one pray a prayer for each other now. Put your hands over on somebody around you. [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-128 Lord, here before me is a box of handkerchiefs, little pieces of goods; some old mother laying somewhere, dying, a baby near death, sick people everywhere. We read in the Bible that they took from the body of Paul handkerchiefs and aprons, and they were placed upon the sick; and evil spirits, and unclean spirits, and sicknesses, and diseases, departed from the people. Now, Lord, we know we're not Saint Paul, but we know that You still remain Jesus, the only God-provided place of worship. And now, today, these people has confessed their same faith, as believing like those people did. Surely You have made a way for them! And I put my hands upon these handkerchiefs and ask that the diseases and afflictions leave the bodies of the people these will be laid on in the Name of Jesus Christ. [Acts 19:11-12]\n\nL-129 Now, we are taught, that as Israel was coming out of Egypt, in the line of duty, they were on their road to the promised land. The Red Sea got in their way. And God looked down through the Pillar of Fire, and the sea got scared, rolled back, and let Israel pass to the promised land. O God, look down through the Blood of Jesus, tonight, and may the sickness roll back, and Satan be cast out. And may the people pass to that promise of good health and strength, that God said, \"Above all things, I wish you would prosper in health.\" [III John 1:2]\n\nL-130 Now as You see there, Lord Jesus, the hands of these people laying on each other, they are symbolizing their faith, that You said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\" They are praying in their own way, for one another. The next person is praying for them. [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-131 Now, Lord, this challenge has been met, that Satan, the big bluff, he has no right to hold a child of God. He is a defeated being. Jesus Christ, the only place of worship, the only true Name, defeated him at Calvary. And we claim His Blood right now, that He defeated every sickness, every disease. And I call for Satan to leave this audience. In the Name of Jesus Christ, come out of this people, and they be made free.\n\nL-132 Everybody that accepts their healing upon the basis of the written Word, make your testimony by stand to your feet and say, \"I now accept my healing in the Name of Jesus Christ.\" Rise up to your feet. Praise be to God! There you are. Watch over here, of cripples and things getting up. Praise be to God. That's it. Just believe. He's here. How wonderful!\n\nL-133 Out in the audience, on the outside, by the wires, you should see! I think every person in here, as far as I know, or most of them, are standing up at this time. Oh, what a wonderful time! The Presence of the Lord, that's what! \"Where the Presence of the Lord is, there is liberty, there is freedom.\" The Spirit of God makes us free.\n\nL-134 Now that He has healed us, we believe it. He saved us; we believe it. Those who wants to be baptized, the pool is ready. Any time, any hour that you want to come, there'll be someone there to attend to it. And now I think, before we close, we ought to sing an old hymn of the church. \"I love Him, I love Him because He first loved me.\" Raise up our hands to God and sing it with all of our hearts! 65-0220, God's Chosen Place Of Worship, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min We want to meet you here in the morning, at nine-thirty, this same building, for the subject of Marriage And Divorce. All right. Let's sing it now together. I love Him, Let this great audience sing that now! Way out on the wires, sing it, also. Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree.\n\nL-135 Where was it done? On Calvary's tree. While we sing it again, I want you to shake hands with somebody around you, say, \"God bless you, pilgrim.\" I... [Brother Branham shakes hands with the brethren--Ed.] Because He first... And purchased my salvation On...\n\nL-136 Oh, don't you love Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Isn't He wonderful? [\"Amen.\"] Is He your Hiding Place? [\"Amen.\"] He's a Rock in a weary land, a Shelter in the time of storm, the only Refuge I know. Therefore: My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary, Saviour Divine; Now hear me while I pray, Take all my guilt away, Let me from this day Be wholly Thine! Let's raise our hands as we sing it. My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary, O Saviour Divine; Now hear me while I pray, Take all my sin away, O let me from this day Be wholly Thine! Let us bow our heads now while we hum it. While life's dark maze I tread, And grief around me spread, Be Thou my Guide; Bid darkness turn to day, Wipe sorrow's tears away, Nor let me ever stray From Thee aside.

The organist played Because and Oh Promise Me, at the beginning; then the minister, the groom and his attendants came to the altar; then the Bridal Chorus was played as the bride's attendants came to the altar, followed by the bride--Ed.] Who will I ask to give this woman to be wife to this man? [The bride's father answers, \"I, her father, will.\"--Ed.] Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God, and in the face of this company, to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is commanded by Saint Paul to be honorable among all men. It is therefore not by any to be entered into unadvisably or lightly, but advisably, soberly, and in the fear of God. Into this holy state these two persons present come to be joined. If there is any persons here that can show a just cause why they should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony, do you now speak, or, from hereafter, forever hold your peace. [Genesis 2:24], [Mark 10:7-9], [Hebrews 13:4], [Matthew 19:5-6]\n\nL-2 I will require and will charge you both, as you'll surely answer at the Day of Judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of you know any impediment why you should not be lawful joined together in this matrimony, do you now confess it, for be it assured unto you that any couple that are joined otherwise than God's Word doth allow, their marriage is not lawful. [Romans 2:14-16] But duly believing that you have considered this solemn obligation that you're about to assume, then, that you have prepared to enter upon the same, reverently, discreetfully, soberly, and in the fear of God, I shall propose to you the marriage covenant. You will declare the same as you join your right hands together. [The groom and bride join their right hands together--Ed.] [Romans 2:16]\n\nL-3 Will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife, to live together in this holy state of matrimony; do you promise to honor and love and cherish, in sickness and health, riches or poverty, and will forsake all others and cleave thee only unto her as long as you both live?

[The bride answers, \"I will.\"--Ed.] I will require a token that this covenant will always be kept.

We will all bow our heads.\n\nL-4 Almighty God, the great Creator of all things, the Author of everlasting Life, and the Giver of all good gifts, when Thou didst see fit to give man a present, You gave him a wife. It is written, \"He that has found a wife, has found a good thing.\" And as we stand this afternoon, after many thousands of years, our mind is brought back to the time that the first ceremony was ever performed, it was by You, Father, in the garden of Eden, when You married our father and mother, Adam and Eve, and to this day man has taken to him a wife. [Proverbs 18:22] Father, we pray that You will bless this young man and this young woman, who has found love in their hearts, one to the other. And in the reckless age that we are now living, so many divorces, break-ups in homes, may it not be with this couple. May they remember this vow as long as they live! May there be no powers to ever separate them! I pray Thee, Father, as You did bless Isaac and Rebekah, and made them ever happy in their lives, and they were fruitful, [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] we pray that You will likewise do to this young man and this young lady, who have agreed upon this, talked it over with each other in secret, and now has come to the church and this company, to offer their troth, 65-0220w, Wedding Ceremony, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, no audio one to the other, and has so did and declared it in this public place. Now, Father, by the power of my commission given me by Almighty God, to be His servant, and has been witnessed to me by an Angel, by this authority I now pronounce this man and this woman, husband and wife, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. , [Matthew 19:6], [Genesis 25:20-21]\n\nL-5 God bless you. You are married. [The couple kiss, then face the congregation.

And as we here today, many of us, has went through the similar time, for the same purpose. We are minded, as we see a young man and a young woman, that has agreed to live holy and separate from the world and other companions, to live only to them, each other. We are minded of the Church that also has agreed to live holy and accept, from the world, separated, and waiting for the Coming of the Bridegroom. May our hearts beat in love for Him. May our minds be upon Him, and waiting and longing for that great Wedding Supper that's going to be in the air, one day when He does come. Though He tarry, yet He'll be here. And as we leave today, then may this be reunited in our minds and our hearts, and may we pledge ourself to Thee anew, to live undefiled from the world, that we might someday be a partaker of that great Ceremony that's soon to come.

And also I want to thank Houston Colvin, which is the custodian here, for his fine co-operation in helping us to get this and being with us each night.\n\nL-8 We thank the Jeffersonville police force for coming up here and watching, with a real cheap cost. I think about two dollars a hour, that the police were put up here on special duty, to park the cars, to see that there was no... nothing happened, and everything was all right. We're grateful to the people for that. And to the--the, also, the engineer here on the--the board, I've noticed him. And all that's affiliated with this, we are certainly grateful to you.\n\nL-9 I thank each and every one of you for the gifts. Billy just brought me, this afternoon, a--a gift, several of them, and boxes, candy, and so forth. And one of them was the--the Beatitudes, with a picture of Christ worked in it--it, the Sermon on the Mount. And it certainly was beautiful. I certainly thank you.

The Lord bless each one of you, richly.\n\nL-10 Billy said, there was many people, you had been asking for private interviews during the time. And many asked and had little babies to be dedicated. Oh, how I want to do that! But, you see, when I come this time, it's so urgent. I have to stay right, all the time, in study, this Word and prayer, on 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min account of bringing these Messages. See, they're not... They're--they're extraordinary to us, because it's finding the will of God and then speaking the things. And all that has to meet together, and asking God just which one to open up.\n\nL-11 Now, the Lord willing, we'll be back again soon, as soon as we can find a day. I made a--a motion, or--or said something about Easter. I better check that, because I think I've got a schedule in California along about that time. So that may be wrong. However, when we return again to the tabernacle, we'll send you a card, and the church, and--and give you the--the date and time. Then I'll, maybe at that time, again...\n\nL-12 I haven't put any time to praying for the sick. We haven't had one service that we brought the people up and prayed for them. We been sending them out. And our brethren here has been preaching, Brother Lee Vayle and Brother... These other brothers has been preaching, and praying for the sick, and doing the water baptism, baptizing, rather, and letting me stay alone with the Word. We thank these men. They done a gallant job.\n\nL-13 There is so many friends here I'd like to meet. I look down and see John and Earl. And there is Doctor Lee Vayle, one of the managers of the campaign. Brother Roy Borders. Them man, I haven't even got... I haven't even no more than shook their hand. I haven't had a chance to. I think of my friends from Kentucky, and around in here, and minister friends, how I would like to shake their hands! Brother Blair, I noticed him here the other day. And many of those man that I--I love, and they been to several meetings, and I've never even as much as shook their hand. I--I'm trying... It isn't because I don't want to do that; it's because I haven't the time to do it, and I just a hurry.\n\nL-14 Dedicating the babies, sure. My own son, my little grandson was supposed to be dedicated at this meeting. I haven't had time to do it; little David. I'm grandpa, twice now. So, Mr. May, if he's here tonight, who give me that cane, look like I'm going to have to use it pretty soon.\n\nL-15 So, and I told Billy, I said, \"The Bible did say multiply and replenish the earth, but the whole burden wasn't given to you.\" And these grandsons are appearing fast. And so, remember, my daughter-in-law was barren, to begin with. She could not have no children. And one day, leaving a meeting, the Lord spoke to me and said, \"Loyce, you will bare a son. The Lord has blessed you. Your female trouble is gone.\" Little Paul was born, nine months later. [Genesis 1:28]\n\nL-16 Two months before this baby come on the scene, I was setting, eating breakfast one morning, at the table, and Loyce and Billy was setting across the table from me. And I seen Loyce feeding a little baby with a pink... or a blue blanket wrapped around it. And Billy was setting in the corner, feeding little Paul. I said, \"Billy, I just saw a vision. Loyce was feeding a baby wrapped in a blue blanket.\" He said, \"There goes my hunting trip. That's just nine months from now.\" Eleven months later, little David was born. And I haven't been able to dedicate him to the Lord yet, and will not until we return again. So you see what it is.\n\nL-17 How I love people and their fellowship! But our brethren has been praying for the sick, and I know it's a success. Each night we prayed for the sick, one laying their hands on the other, all of us together, which that way it catches the whole scope. But maybe, if God willing... I'll mark it on the card, if we send it. Coming back, I'd like to dedicate about two or three days, again, just to praying for the sick and doing what we can in that manner. Now, and I thank the people for their help, again.\n\nL-18 Now I just want to comment, just a moment, on the--on the morning's Message. There's no doubt, I didn't get completely through with it, but I think you understand. And I'm sure you didn't... You'll never know what that was for me to do.\n\nL-19 Now, it seems very simple to you. But, you, you see what you're doing? You are taking the place of God, to pronounce Something. And before I would do that, it had to come an answer from God. And He had to come down, and He visibly showed Himself, and gave the Revelation. Therefore, see, this is to the Church. And remember, I said, \"These, this what I said, was to the Church only.\"\n\nL-20 And so that you might have confidence and know, that was the same God that said to me up there where there was no squirrel. \"Speak, and say where they'll be.\" And three straight times it happened. Now, if He can by that same word 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min create something that isn't there, how much more will This hold fast at the Day of Judgment! See? People were there to see these things, and know. As Paul said, in the days gone by. There's man with him, who--who felt the earth shake; and didn't hear the voice, but they--they seen the--the Pillar of Fire. [Acts 22:9]\n\nL-21 It done me good, though, after it was over; to see husbands and wives, that I know is genuine Christians, hugging one another and weeping.\n\nL-22 And listen, friends, God confirms His Word with signs and vindications, to prove that It's right, the spoken Word. Now remember, that Light that was in that Cloud, that gave the Revelation. I was... My little girl was telling me, Sarah here, that when they... That school there in Arizona was looking up there on a cloudless sky, and seeing this Cloud mysteriously in that mountain, going up-and-down, with an amber Fire burning in It. The teacher dismissed the classes and the school, and brought them out front, and said, \"Did you ever see anything like that? Look the way that's there.\" Remember, that's that same amber Light that's on the rock. So it's the same God, same Revelation, said, \"Tell them to do this.\" Is what I told you this morning, so there It is.\n\nL-23 If it happens to be that my good friend, Brother Roy Roberson, is listening in at Tucson. Roy, you remember, the other day, the vision you seen when we were out standing upon the mountain? You come up to me, and that Cloud was over the top? Come walking down, you know what He told you; and I told you at that house, the other day? That's it, Roy. Don't worry no more, son. It's over.\n\nL-24 You just don't know what that means! It's grace. He loves you. And you love Him, humbly serve Him and worship Him the rest of your days. Be happy, go ahead and live as you are. If you're happy, continue that way. Don't never do anything wrong again, like that. Just go ahead. It's God's grace.\n\nL-25 Now I want to pray again before we enter into the Word. How many will pray for me? I'm just going from meeting to meeting. Will you pray? You know, I'd like to sing you a little song, all of us together, before we go to the Word. Just to... so that we'd know God... Just a little dedication. Did you ever hear this little song, He Careth For You? \"Through sunshine and sorrow, He careth for you.\"\n\nL-26 The little lady is coming up to the piano. Say, I want to thank this little lady, too. I didn't even know who she was. It's one of the deacon's daughters here. I certainly... Brother Wheeler's little girl. She is growed up now. She was a little bitty thing that set on my knee, not long ago, and now she's a young woman. So I certainly thank her that she's used her talent in music, and now she plays very sweetly. Would you give us the chord, sister? All of us together now. He careth for you, He careth for you; Through sunshine or shadow, He careth for you. You love that? Let's sing it again, all together. He careth for you, He careth for you; Through sunshine or shadow, He careth for you. Brother Dauch, He does for you, too, brother. Don't you love Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Let us bow our heads now.\n\nL-27 Dear Gracious God, with this little note here of a few things to say to the people, and back again to refer back to this morning, for that's what the people come to hear. I pray, God, that You'll let the people see that God loves and cares. And it was not me that give That, Lord, it was vindicated that it was the Truth. So I pray, Dear God, that Your love will always remain among the people. Tonight, to have to separate after this meeting and go to our different homes, it--it kind of pulls us, some, deep, Lord. I pray that You'll bless these people. 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min\n\nL-28 Now as we approach the Word, in prayer, and approach the written Word, we ask that You will take this written Word and make It alive to us tonight. And when we leave this building tonight to separate to go to our different homes, may we say like those who came from Emmaus, that had walked with Him all day and still didn't know Him; but when He got them inside the room that night, and the doors all shut, He did something just like He did before His crucifixion. By that, they knowed He had risen again.Do it again tonight, Lord. Grant it, while the doors are shut, and Your little group here is setting, waiting. And, Father, when we go to our homes, we'll say like they did, \"Did not our hearts burn within us as He talked to us along the way!\" We commit ourselves, and all, in Your hands, Lord. Do with us as You see fit. In Jesus' Name. Amen. [Luke 24:32]\n\nL-29 Now let's get right into the service now, quickly. Turning now with me, if you will, to the Book of Hebrews, and another revelation on the Message. We'll speak for just a few moments tonight, the Lord willing. And then while reading the first three verses of Hebrews 7:1 to 3, and then commenting on this. And we don't know what the Lord will do; we do not know. The only thing we do is just believe, watch, pray. That right? And believe that \"He'll make everything work together for good to them that loves Him,\" because He promised to. [Romans 8:28] For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;Let's read a little farther.Without father, without mother, without descent,... neither beginning of days, or end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually. [Hebrews 7:1-3]\n\nL-30 Think of this great Person, of how great this Man must be! And now, the question is, \"Who is this Man?\" Theologians has had different ideas. But since the opening of the Seven Seals, the mysterious Book that's been mysterious to us... According to Revelations 10:1 to 7, all the mysteries that's wrote in this Book, that's been hid down through the age of the reformers, is supposed to be brought out into view by the angel of the last church age. How many knows that's right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] That's right, supposed to be brought. All the mysteries of the mysterious Book is to be revealed to the Laodicea messenger of that age. [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-31 Seeing there is much dispute about this Person and this subject, I think it behooves us to break into it, to find out Who this is. Now, there is several schools of thought on Him.One of them schools are, claims, \"He's just a myth. He wasn't actually a person.\"And the others says, that, \"It was a priesthood. That was the Melchisedec priesthood.\" That's the most likely one, that hold better to that side than they do to the other, is because they say it was a priesthood.It can't be that, for in the 4th verse It says He was a Person, a \"Man.\" So, in order to be a Person, He has to be a personality, a \"Man.\" Not a order; but a Person! So He was not just a priesthood order, neither was He a myth. He was a Person. [Hebrews 7:1, 17]\n\nL-32 And the Person is Eternal. If you notice, \"He had no father. He had no mother. He had no time He ever began. And He had no time He ever ended.\" And ever Who it was is still alive tonight, because the Bible said here, that, \"He had neither father, nor mother, beginning of days, or ending of life.\" So It would have to be an Eternal Person. Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] An Eternal Person! So it could only be one Person, that's God, 'cause He's the only One that's Eternal. God! [Hebrews 7:3]\n\nL-33 Now, in First Timothy 6:15 and 16, if you'd like to read that sometime, I'd like for you to read it. Now, the thing that I contend is, that, He was God, because He's the only Person that can be immortal. And now, God changing Himself into Person; that's what He was, \"No father, no mother, no beginning of life, no ending of days.\" [I Timothy 6:15-16]\n\nL-34 Now we find in the Scripture that many people teaches that, \"three personalities in the Godhead.\" So, you cannot have a personality without being a person. It takes a person to make a personality. A Baptist minister, a few weeks ago, come up, and to my house, and said, \"I'd like to straighten you out on the Godhead sometime when you got time.\" Called me up, rather.\n\nL-35 I said, \"I got time right now, 'cause I want to be straight, and we lay aside everything else, to do it.\" 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min And he come up, he said, \"Brother Branham, you teach that there is just one God.\" I said, \"Yes, sir.\" He said, \"Well,\" he said, \"I believe there is one God, but one God in three Persons.\" I said, \"Sirs, repeat that again.\" He said, \"One God, in three Persons.\" [John 10:30]\n\nL-36 I said, \"Where did you go to school at?\" See? And he told me a--a Bible college. I said, \"I could believe that. You cannot be a person without being a personality. And if you're a personality, you are one personality to yourself. You're a separate, individual being.\" And he said, \"Well, the theologians can't even explain that.\" I said, \"It's by revelation.\" And he said, \"I can't accept revelation.\" [Matthew 16:17]\n\nL-37 I said, \"Then there's no way for God to ever get to you, because, 'It's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent, and revealed to babes,' revealed, revelation, 'revealed to babes such as will accept it, learn.'\" And I said, \"There'd be no way for God to get to you; you close yourself off from Him.\"The whole Bible is the revelation of God. The whole Church is built upon the revelation of God. There is no other way to know God, only by revelation. \"To whom the Son will reveal Him.\" Revelation; everything is revelation. So, to acce-... Not to accept the revelation, then you're just a cold theologian, and there is no hope for you. [Matthew 11:25], [Luke 10:21], [Matthew 11:25], [Galatians 1:12]\n\nL-38 Now, now, we find out that this Person \"had no father, no mother, no beginning of days or ending of life.\" It was God, en morphe. Now, the world, the word comes, the Greek word, means, \"change,\" was used. Changing Himself, en morphe, from one person to... One person; the Greek word there, en morphe, means... It was taken from the stage act, that one person is changing his mask, to make him some other character. [Hebrews 7:3]\n\nL-39 Like in--in school, just recently, I believe, Rebekah, just before she graduated, they had one of Shakespeare's play. And one young man had to change his clothes several times, because he played two or three different parts; but, the same person. He come out, one time, he was the villain; and when he come out next time, he was another character. And now the Greek word, en morphe, mean that he \"changed his mask.\"\n\nL-40 And that's what God did. It's the same God all the time. God in the form of the Father, the--the Spirit, the Pillar of Fire. The same God was made flesh and dwelt among us, en morphe, brought out so He could be seen. And now that same God is the Holy Ghost. Father, Son, Holy... not three Gods; three offices, three acts of the one God. [John 1:14]\n\nL-41 The Bible said, \"There is one God,\" not three. But that's how that they couldn't... You can't get this straightened out and have three Gods. You would never sell a Jew that. I'll tell you that. One who knows better, he knows there's only one God. [Ephesians 4:6], [John 10:30]\n\nL-42 Notice, like the sculpture, he hides, with a--a mask over it. That's what God has done to this age. It's been hid. All these things has been hid, and is supposed to be revealed in this age. Now, the Bible says they will be revealed in the latter times. It's like a sculptor keeping his--his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it and there it is. And that's what the Bible has been. It has been a work of God that's been covered up. And It's been hid since the foundation of the world, and Its sevenfold mystery. And God promised in this day, at the age of this Laodicean church, He would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see It. What a glorious thing! [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-43 God, en morphe, masked in the Pillar of Fire. God, en morphe, in a Man called Jesus. God, en morphe, in His Church. God above us, God with us, God in us; the condescending of God.Up There, holy, no one could touch Him, He settled upon the mountain; and even if a animal touched the mountain, had to die.And then God come down and changed His tent, and come down and lived with us, become one of us.\" And we held Him,\" the Bible said. First Timothy 3:16, \"Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness; for God was manifested in the flesh, handled with hands.\" God eat meat. God drank water. God slept. God cried. He was one of us. Beautiful, typed in the 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min Bible!That was God above us; God with us; now it's God in us, the Holy Spirit. Not the third Person; the same Person! [I Timothy 3:16], [Exodus 19:12-13]\n\nL-44 God came down and become flesh, and died the death, in Christ; so that He could clean the Church, in order to get into it, for fellowship. God loves fellowship. That's what He made the man at the first time for, was for fellowship; God dwells alone, with Cherubims.\n\nL-45 And notice now, He made man, and man fell. So He came down and redeemed man, because God loves to be worshipped. The very word god means \"object of worship.\"And this that comes among us, as a Pillar of Fire, as something that changes our hearts, that is the same God that said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. [Genesis 1:3]\n\nL-46 Now, in the beginning God dwelled alone, with His attributes, as I spoke of this morning. That's His thoughts. There was nothing, just God alone, but He had thoughts. Just like a great architect can set down, in his mind, and draw out what he thinks it's he's going to--to build. Create, now, he cannot create. He can take something that's been created and make it in a different form; 'cause God is the only way... only One can create. But he gets in his mind what he's going to do, and that's his thoughts, that's his desires. Now it's a thought, and then he speaks it, and it's a word then. And a--a word is...\n\nL-47 A thought, when it's expressed, it's a word. A thought expressed is a word, but it has to be a thought first. So, it's God's attributes; then it becomes a thought, then a word.\n\nL-48 Notice. Those who have, tonight, Eternal Life, was with Him and in Him, in His thinking, before there ever was an Angel, star, Cherubim, or anything else. That's Eternal. And if you have Eternal Life, you always was. Not your being here, but the shape and form that the infinite God...\n\nL-49 And if He isn't infinite, He isn't God. God has to be infinite. We are finite; He is infinite. And He was omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. If He isn't, then He can't be God. Knows all things, all places, because of His omnipresent. Omniscient makes Him omnipresent. He is a Being; He's not like the wind. He is a Being; He dwells in a house. But being omniscient, knowing all things, makes Him omnipresent, because He knows everything that's going on. There can't be a flea bat its eyes but what He knowed it. And He knowed it before there was a world, how many time it'd bat its eyes, and how much tallow it had in it, before there ever was a world. That is infinite. We can't comprehend it in our minds, but that's God. God, infinite!\n\nL-50 And remember, you, your eyes, your statue, whatever you was, you were in His thinking at the beginning. And the only thing that you are is the expression, word. After He thought it, He spoke it, and here you are. If it isn't, if you wasn't in His thinking, there is no way at all for you ever be there, for He is the One that gives Eternal Life.\n\nL-51 You remember how we read the Scriptures? \"Not him that willeth, or him that runneth, but God!\" And that His predestination might stand true, He could choose, before any time, who. God is sovereign in His choosing. Did you know that? God is sovereign.Who was back there to tell Him a better way to make the world? Who would dare to tell Him He was running His business wrong?Even the very--the very Word, Itself, very sovereign. Even the revelation is sovereign. \"He reveals to whom He will reveal.\" The very revelation, itself, is sovereign in God. That's how people pound at things, and jump at things, and hit at things, not knowing what they're doing. God is sovereign in His works. [Romans 9:16]\n\nL-52 Now we find Him at the beginning, His attributes. And, now, you were with Him then. Then is when the Book of Life comes into view.Now, we read over here in Revelations the 13th chapter, the 8th verse, that, \"The beast that comes upon the earth,\" in these last days, \"will deceive all those people on the earth whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world.\" [Revelation 13:8]\n\nL-53 Think of it! Before Jesus was ever born, four thousand years before He came on earth, and several thousand years before you come on earth; Jesus, in God's mind, died for the sins of the world, and the Book of Life was made, and your name was put on that Book of Life before the foundation of the world. That's the Bible Truth. See, your name was ordained of God and placed on the Book of Life before the foundation of the world. 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min\n\nL-54 You were there in His attributes. You don't remember it, no, because you're just a part of His Life. You are a part of God when you become a son or a daughter of God. Just as you are a part of your earthly father! That's right. You are. The male carries the hemoglobin, the blood. And when that has gone in--in the egg, then you become a part of your father; and your mother is a part of your father, also; so you're all a part of your father. Glory! That lets the denomination out, altogether. Uh-huh. Certainly does! God, in all, the only place!\n\nL-55 Notice now His attribute. Then the attribute was, first, God; the thought, the attribute itself, all in One, without being expressed. Then when He expressed, secondarily, He became then the Word. \"And then the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\"\n\nL-56 Saint John the 1st chapter and the 1st verse, notice, this is, \"In the beginning.\" But, before, the Eternal! Notice, \"In the beginning was the Word.\" When the time begin, it was Word. But before it was Word, it was attribute, a thought. Then it was expressed, \"In the beginning was,\" the expression, \"the Word.\"Now we're getting where Melchisedec is. That's this mysterious Person. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" \"And then the Word became flesh and dwelled among us.\" Hold that there now, notice. [John 1:1]\n\nL-57 His--His first being was Spirit, God, supernatural, all right, the great Eternal. Second, He begin to form Himself towards flesh, in a theophany, it's called \"the Word; a body.\" This then is the state He was in when He met Abraham, was called Melchisedec. He was in the form of theophany. Now we'll get to that and prove it in a few minutes, the Lord willing. He was the Word.\n\nL-58 A theophany is something that you could not see. It could be right here now, yet you cannot see it. It's just like, well, like television. That's in another dimension. Television; people are moving right through this room now, singing; there is colors, also. But the eye is only subject to the five senses... Your whole being is only subject to five senses, rather. And you are only subject to what the sight has been limited to see. But there is another dimension that can be seen by a transformation, by television.\n\nL-59 Now, television does not manufacture a picture. A television only channels it into a circuit, and then the television screen picks it up. But the picture is there, to begin with. Television was here when Adam was here. Television was here when Elijah set on mount Carmel. Television was here when Jesus of Nazareth walked the shores of Galilee. But you're just now discovering it. They wouldn't have believed it back there. You'd have been crazy to have said something like it. But now it's become a reality. And so is it, that Christ is here, the Angels of God are here. And someday, in the great Millennium to come, it'll be just more real than television or anything else, because they are here.\n\nL-60 He reveals Himself in His great form of what He claimed, as He en morphes Himself into His servants and proves Himself.\n\nL-61 Now, here He is in the form of Spirit. And then He comes in the form of a... of en morphe. Now, He appeared to Abraham, en morphe. When Abraham was returning from the slaughter of the kings, here come Melchisedec, talked to Him. [Hebrews 7:1]\n\nL-62 The other day in the Tucson paper, I was reading an article that where there was a--a woman driving down the road, I believe about forty, fifty miles an hour, and she hit an old man with an overcoat on. She screamed and stopped her car. It threw him up in the air. Right out in the plain desert! And she run back to find him, and he wasn't there. So what did she do? Some people behind her saw it happen, saw the old man fly up in the air, and his overcoat turning. So they run back to find out. They couldn't find the man anywhere. They called the police force. The police come out to examine the place; there was nobody there.\n\nL-63 Well, each one of them testified, \"The car chugged, hit the man. He went up in the air, and everybody saw it.\" Witnesses, and two or three carloads of them, they seen it happen. Come to find out, five years ago, there was an old man with an overcoat on, hit and killed on the same spot.When you leave here, you're not dead. You've got to come back, even if you're a sinner, and be judged according to the deeds done in the body. \"If this earthly tabernacle is 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min dissolved, we have one waiting.\" En morphe, that's the word. [II Corinthians 5:1]\n\nL-64 Now, God, in this stage of... It's this stage of His creation, later formed into flesh, Jesus. From what? From the great beginning, Spirit, then came down to be the Word, bringing Itself out. The Word doesn't yet make Itself, it's just spoke out, en morphe, later He becomes flesh, Jesus, mortal, to taste death for all of us sinners.\n\nL-65 When Abraham met Him, He was Melchisedec. He unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end, every son of Abraham. Every son of the Faith will absolutely do the same thing. But I want to watch how we have to come.\n\nL-66 Also, we see Him revealed here in Ruth and--and Boaz, as a Kinsman Redeemer, how He had to come to be flesh.\n\nL-67 Now we see the attribute, sons of His Spirit, have not yet entered into the Word-form body. But, a theophany; this body is subject to the Word and earnest, waiting for the earnest, change of the body.\n\nL-68 Now, the different between Him and you, as a son. See, He was, at the beginning, the Word, an en morphe body. He came in and lived in that, in the Person of Melchisedec. Then, later, we never heard no more of Melchisedec, because He became Jesus Christ. Melchisedec was the Priest, but He became Jesus Christ. Now, you by-passed that. Because, in that form, He knowed all things, and you have never been able to know that yet.You come like Adam, like me, you became from the attribute to the flesh, to be tempted. But when this life is finished here, \"If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting.\" That's where we go; that is the Word. Then we can look back and see what we done. Now we don't understand it. We have never become the Word; we've just become the flesh-man, not the Word. [II Corinthians 5:1]\n\nL-69 But, and look, clearly makes it clear, you will never be the Word unless you was a thought at the beginning. That proves the predestination of God. See? You can't be the Word unless you're a thought. You had to be in the thinking, first.But, you see, in order to stand temptation, you had to by-pass the theophany. You had to come down here in flesh, to be tempted by sin. And then, if you stand, \"All the Father hath given Me will come to Me, and I'll raise him up at the last days.\" See, you had to be first. [John 6:39]\n\nL-70 And then, you see, He come right down, the regular line, from attribute to... Before the foundation of the world, his name is put on the Lamb's Book of Life. Then, from that, He become the Word, the theophany, that could appear, disappear. And then He become flesh and returned back again, resurrected that same body in a glorified condition.But you by-passed the theophany and become flesh-man, to be tempted by sin. And then, \"If this earthly tabernacle is dissolved, we have one already waiting.\" We have not yet the bodies. [II Corinthians 5:1]\n\nL-71 But, look! When this body receives the Spirit of God, the immortal Life inside of you, it throws this body in subjection to God. Hallelujah! \"He that's born of God doth not commit sin; he cannot sin.\" Romans 8:1, \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus; they walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\" There you are. See, that throws your body subject. You don't have to say, \"Oh, if I could just quit drinking! If I could just...\" Just get in Christ, and it's all gone, see, see, because your body is subject to the Spirit. It's no more subject to the things of the world; they're dead. They are dead; your sins are buried in baptism, and you are a new creation in Christ. And your body, becoming subject to the Spirit, try to live a right kind of life. [Romans 8:1], [I John 3:9]\n\nL-72 Like you women claiming you got Holy Ghost, and going out here and wearing shorts and things, how could you do it? How could the Spirit of God in you ever let you do such a thing as that? It just can't be so. Certainly, it can't be. He's not a filthy spirit; He's a holy Spirit.\n\nL-73 And then when you become subject to that Spirit, it throws your whole being subject to that Spirit. And that Spirit is nothing in the world but this Seed Word made manifest, or quickened, hallelujah, made alive. And when the Bible said, \"Don't do this,\" that body quickly turns to It. There is no question. And what is it? It's the earnest of the resurrection. This body will be raised up again, because it's already started. It was once subject to sin, and mire and corruption, but now it's got the earnest; it's turned Heavenly. Now, that's the earnest that you're going in the Rapture. It's the earnest. 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min\n\nL-74 A sick person laying, dying, nothing left but death; that's all can happen. I've seen a shadows of people, done eat up with cancer and tuberculosis; and see them persons, a little while after that, perfectly normal and strong. If there is no Divine healing, then there is no resurrection, 'cause Divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection. Amen!\n\nL-75 You know what the earnest money is, don't you? It's the down payment. \"He was wounded for our transgressions; with His stripes we're healed.\" Notice how wonderful! We love Him. [Isaiah 53:5]\n\nL-76 Now, this body is subject to the Spirit. Have not yet entered into the Word form, but we are still in the flesh form, but subject to the Word. Death in the flesh will take us there.\n\nL-77 Just the same thing, think of a little baby. You can take a woman, no matter how evil she is, when she is pregnant and fixing to be mother. Watch, before that baby is born, I don't care how cruel the woman is, she gets real kind. There is something about her sound... seems godly, to see a little mother fixing to become mother, by the baby. Why is it? That little body, now, it's not alive yet, see, the only thing it is is just flesh and muscles. That little jumping, that's just muscles jerking. But when it comes forth from the womb, God breathes the breath of life into it, and then he screams out. See, just as--as sure as there is a natural body being formed, there is a spiritual body to receive it as soon as it gets here.\n\nL-78 Then, when a man is born again, from Heaven, he becomes a spirit babe in Christ. And, then, when this robe of flesh is dropped, there is a natural body, theophany, a body not made with hands, neither born of a woman, that we go to. Then that body returns back and picks up the glorified body. That's the reason Jesus went to hell when He died, and preached to the souls that were in prison; turned back into that theophany. Oh, marvelous! Thank God! [I Peter 3:19]\n\nL-79 Second Corinthians 5:1, \"If this earthly body be dissolved, this earthly tabernacle, we have another one.\" See, we have by-passed that, to come straight from God, the attribute; to be flesh, to be tempted and tested by sin, like Adam did. But when testing of His Word is over, then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world. It is the Word there that we skipped, to come right around, down here to be tempted and tested. If we'd have come through that, there'd have been no temptation; we'd a-knowed all things. That's the reason Jesus knowed all things, 'cause He was Word before He was flesh. Then we become the Word. [II Corinthians 5:1]\n\nL-80 Here we are formed to the Word image, to be a partaker of the Word, feed on the Word, by being predestinated since the beginning; you see that little spark of Life that you had in you from the beginning, when you started your journey. Many of you can remember it. You joined this church and joined that church, you'd try this and that; nothing satisfied. That's right. But one day you just recognized It. Right.\n\nL-81 The other night I was teaching somewhere, I think it was out in California or Arizona, about... I believe I've told the little story here, about the man setting a hen and had an eagle egg under it. And when that eagle hatched out, he was the funniest-looking bird that them chickens ever seen. But, he walked around. He was the--he was the ugly one among them, because he just couldn't understand how that hen will cluck and scratch on that manure pile and eat. He couldn't get the idea. She would say, \"Come on over and feast, honey!\" But, he was a eagle; he just didn't eat like that. It wasn't his food.\n\nL-82 So she would catch grasshoppers and whatmore, you know, and call the little chickens. And all them little chickens would go along, cluck along, and eat. But the little eagle just couldn't do it. It didn't--didn't look right to him. So one day his mammy come hunting him.\n\nL-83 And he would hear that hen cluck. He would try his best to cluck, but he couldn't do it. He tried to cheep like a chicken, but he couldn't do it. See, he was a eagle. He, to start with, he was a eagle. He was just hatched under a hen. That's like some church members. Every... That's about the way it is; about one out of a setting, is right.\n\nL-84 But one day his mammy flew over, and she screamed. He recognized it. That sounded right. Why? He was a eagle, to begin with. That's the way it is with the Gospel, or the Word, or the Power of Jesus Christ. When a man has been predestinated to 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min Eternal Life, he hears that true ring, scream of God, nothing can keep him from It. The church might say, \"Days of miracles is past,\" cluck, cluck, cluck. \"Stand here and eat this, and stand here and eat that.\"\n\nL-85 That barnyard stuff won't do for him, anymore. He is gone! \"All things are possible!\" He gets off the ground. That's why, the matter with so many Christians today, they can't get their feet off the ground. The old mammy said, \"Son, jump! You're an eagle. Come up here where I am.\" He said, \"Mom, I never jumped, in my life.\" [Matthew 19:26], [Mark 9:23]\n\nL-86 She said, \"Well, you jump! You're a eagle, to begin with. You're not a chicken.\" So he made his first jump and flopped his wings; didn't do too good, but he got off the ground. That's the way we do. We accept God by faith, by the written Word. There is something in there; it's that Eternal Life. You were predestinated to it.\n\nL-87 His grandpa and grandma were eagles. He was a eagle, all the way back. Eagle don't mix with other things. He's not a hybrid; no. He's a eagle.\n\nL-88 Then, after you recognized the very Word of God was Eagle Food, then you left the other thing. You have then been formed into the living image of the living God. You heard from your theophany. \"If this earthly body be dissolved, we have one waiting.\" You say, \"Is that right, Brother Branham?\" All right, let's take a couple of eagles and look at them for a few minutes. There was a name, man named Moses. Everyone knows that a prophet is called the eagle, in the Bible.\n\nL-89 There was a prophet named Moses. And one day God called him, and wouldn't let him go over the land, and he--he died on a rock. The Angels took him away and buried him.There was another man, a eagle, didn't even have to die. He just walked across Jordan, and God sent a chariot down; and this robe of flesh he dropped, and rise and caught the everlasting prize.Eight hundred years later, eight hundred years later, on Mount Transfiguration, here stood those two man. Moses' body had been rotten for hundreds of years, but here he was in such a form till even Peter, James, and John recognized him. Amen! \"If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved,\" if you're an attribute of God expressed here on earth, \"you've got a body waiting after you leave this world.\" There they was, standing on Mount Transfiguration, in their theophany. For, they were prophets to whom the Word came to. [Luke 9:33], [II Kings 2:11], [II Corinthians 5:1-2]\n\nL-90 Also let us notice another prophet, one time, by the name of Samuel. He was a great man. He had taught Israel; told them they shouldn't have a king. He said, \"Have I ever said one thing to you in the Name of the Lord but what come to pass?\" They said, \"No. Everything you've always said in the Name of the Lord come to pass.\" He was a prophet, and he died.\n\nL-91 About three or four years later, the king got in trouble; that was before the Blood of Jesus Christ was ever shed. He was in paradise. And a witch of Endor called for somebody to come, and console Saul. And when the witch saw him standing up, she said, \"I see god raising up out of the earth.\" [I Samuel 28:13]\n\nL-92 And after the man had been dead, buried, and rotted in the grave, here he was standing there in that cave, with his prophet's robes on; and was still a prophet, amen, for he said, \"Why did you call me out of my rest, seeing you become a enemy to God?\" Watch him prophesy. \"Tomorrow night, by this time, you will be with me.\" He was still a prophet, though he was gone from this body.See, he had become here and was part of that Word, and he entered from the flesh life back into the body that had been prepared for him before the foundation of the world. He entered into the theophany, which was the Word. You get it? That's where all believers go when we turn from here. [I Samuel 28:15, 19]\n\nL-93 Then, in that form, the veil then is lifted. You see, you are the Word, also, when you enter into there. As a little baby; as I said a while ago...\n\nL-94 Now notice. Praise God for these opening Seals, is my prayer, to know these things!\n\nL-95 Now the true revelation of Melchisedec comes into view. What? He was God, the Word, before He became flesh; 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min God, the Word. Cause, He had to be; no one else could be immortal like Him. See, I had father and mother; you did, too. Jesus had father and mother. \"But this Man had no father, or had no mother.\" Jesus had a time He started; this Man didn't. Jesus gave His life; this Man couldn't, because He was Life. And it's the self-same Man all the time. I hope God reveals it to you. The self-same Person, all the time.\n\nL-96 Notice His title, \"King of righteousness.\" Now, Hebrews 7:2, \"King of righteousness, and King of peace.\" He is two kings. Now watch, Hebrews 7:2, \"King of righteousness, also the King of peace.\" He is two kings there. Now since He has come in the flesh and received His body up, in Revelations 21:16, He is called, \"The King of kings.\" He is all three of them, together. See, King God, King Theophany, King Jesus. \"He is the King of kings.\"It's all met, just like soul, body, and spirit, all comes to make one. [Hebrews 7:2]\n\nL-97 Also, He is the Father, which was the first; Son; and Holy Ghost, the Spirit. \"King of righteousness,\" the Spirit attribute; theophany, \"King of--of peace,\" theophany; and in flesh He was \"King of kings,\" same Person.\n\nL-98 When the theophany, Moses seen Him, Exodus 33:2, He was a theophany. Moses wanted to see God. He had heard His voice, heard Him talk to him, seen Him in a bush there, as a big Pillar of Fire. And he said, \"Who are You? I want to know Who You are.\" Moses said. \"I'll put...\" \"If You'll let me see You, I would like to see Your face.\" [Exodus 3:2]\n\nL-99 He said, \"No man can see My face.\" He said, \"I'll put My hand over your eyes, and I'll pass by. And you can see My back, but not My face.\" See? And when He did, it was the back of a Man; it was a theophany. Then the Word that come to Moses, \"I AM,\" that was the Word. The Word came to Moses in the form of a Pillar of Fire in a burning bush, the \"I AM.\" [Exodus 33:22-23]\n\nL-100 As the Word from the theology... from the theophany, rather. Excuse me. He came to Abraham as a Man, under the oak tree. Now look at there. There came a Man to Abraham, three of them, and set down under an oak tree, three of them. And notice, after He talked to Abraham...\n\nL-101 Why did He come? Abraham, being the one with the promise and the message of the coming son, and also he was God's Word-prophet that was trusting God's Word, calling anything contrary as though it wasn't. See how perfect the Word is? The Word came to the prophet. See, there was God in a theophany. And the Bible said, \"The Word comes to the prophet.\" And here was the--the Word in the theophany. Now you say, \"Was that God?\"\n\nL-102 Abraham said it was. He said His name, was, he called Him Elohim. Now in Genesis 1, you find out, \"In the beginning Elohim created the heavens and earth.\" In Genesis 18, we find out that--that Abraham called this Person... that set there and talked to him, and could tell him the secrets of his heart, tell him what Sarah was thinking behind Him. Abraham said, \"It is Elohim.\" He was in a theophany form. You get it? Notice after... [Genesis 1:1]\n\nL-103 Now we find out that He was then in the theophany form. He called Him, \"Lord God, Elohim.\" Now, in Genesis 18, we find that that is true. [Genesis 18:11, 15]\n\nL-104 Now notice Abraham. There was three of them together, but when Abraham met the three, he said, \"My Lord.\" But when Lot, down in Sodom; two of them went down there, and Lot saw two of them coming, and he said, \"My lords.\" See, what was the matter? The first place, Lot was not a prophet, that's right, or neither was he the messenger of the hour, so he didn't have any revelation of Him. It's exactly right. Lot could call them \"lords.\" A dozen of them, he could still said, \"lords.\" But no matter how many Abraham saw, It was still one Lord. There is God. This was the Melchisedec.\n\nL-105 Notice, after the battle was over, Melchisedec served His victorious child communion; think of that, part of Himself! Now we want to see here. In type here is, in view, the communion. After the battle, He gave of Himself, because the communion is part of Christ. And after the struggle is over, after you've done got yourself whipped out, then is when you partake of Christ, become part of this Being. You get it?\n\nL-106 Jacob wrestled all night, and wouldn't turn Him loose until He blessed him. That's right. Battled for Life! And 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min after the battle is over, then God gives you of Himself. That is His true communion. The little bread and wafer just represents It. You shouldn't take it 'less you've wrestled it out and become part of God. [Genesis 32:26]\n\nL-107 Remember, at this time, the communion had never been instituted, not until before the death of Jesus Christ, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years later.\n\nL-108 But Melchisedec, after His child Abraham had won the victory, Melchisedec met him and gave him wine and bread; showing that after this earthly battle is over, we will meet Him in the heavens and take the communion again. It'll be the Wedding Supper. \"I will not drink no more of the vine, or eat the fruit, until I eat it and drink it with you, anew, in My Father's Kingdom.\" Is that right? [Matthew 26:29]\n\nL-109 Notice again, Melchisedec went to meet Abraham before he got back home. What a beautiful type here we have! Melchisedec meeting Abraham before he got back home, after the battle.We meet Jesus in the air, before we get Home. That's right. Second Thessalonians tells us that, for, \"we meet Him in the air.\" A beautiful type of Rebekah meeting Isaac, in the field, in the cool of the day. \"We meet Him in the air.\" Second Thessalonians tells us so. \"For we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep; for the trumpet of God shall sound; the dead in Christ shall rise first; we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them, to meet the Lord in the air.\" Perfect, all these types. [I Thessalonians 4:16-18]\n\nL-110 Therefore, the theophany, if you have died and entered into that theophany, (what happens?) the theophany comes to the earth to pick up the redeemed body. And if you're here in the air, you take the body to meet the theophany, there you are, \"and caught up, and go to meet the Lord in the air.\"\n\nL-111 Who is this Melchisedec but God!\n\nL-112 Now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives in journey, and death, and where we go after we die. Also, predestination is in plain view here. Now listen as we teach this, closely.\n\nL-113 The stages of--of the Eternal purpose He had in His secret has now been revealed. Notice, there is still three stages to perfection. Just like He redeems the world; same way He redeems His Church. He redeems the people in three stages. Now look. First is justification, like Luther preached; second, sanctification, like Wesley preached; third, baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's right. Then comes the Rapture!\n\nL-114 Now, the world, how did He redeem the world? The first, what He did, when it sinned, He washed it off in water baptism. That's right. Then He dropped His blood upon it, from the cross, and sanctified it and called it His Own. And then what does He do? As He tore all the world out of you, and renovated the whole thing by the fiery baptism of the Holy Ghost, He also will renovate the world. And it'll be burnt over with Fire, and cleanse every germ, for millions of miles high, every thing will be cleaned off. And then there is a New Heaven and a New Earth, just like you are a new creature in Christ Jesus when the Holy Spirit takes a hold of you. See, there you are, the whole thing is just as plain as it can be. Everything is in three. [Revelation 21:1], [II Corinthians 5:17]\n\nL-115 The natural birth is in three. What's the first thing happens to the woman having a baby? What breaks first? Water. What breaks next? Blood. What's the next process? Life. Water, blood, spirit. What happens to the plant? Rots. What's the first thing? Stalk. What's the next? Tassel. What's the next? Shuck. Then the grain comes out of that. Just the three stages of it, till it gets to the grain. That's exactly.\n\nL-116 God vindicates that. That's always been right. God vindicates it to be true. Show plainly, the predestinated is the only one that's considered in redemption. Did you get it? Let me say that again. The predestinated is the only one that's considered in redemption. People might be making like, think they are, but the real redemption is those that are predestinated. Because, the very word redeem means \"to bring back.\" Is that right? The redeem is something... To redeem anything, is, \"bring it back to its original place.\" Hallelujah! So it's only the predestinated will be brought back, because the others didn't come from There. See, \"bring back!\"\n\nL-117 Being Eternal with Him, at the beginning... The Eternal Life that you had, His thought of what you was, only, He wanted you to... He wanted me to stand in the pulpit, say. He wanted you to set in the seat tonight. Then we are serving His Eternal purpose. And the one that left home, only come to the earth to serve His purpose. Is that right? All right. 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min Then, after it's finished, it's brought back in a glorified state; it's matured and brought back again.\n\nL-118 No wonder Paul could say, when they was building a block to chop his head off; he said, \"O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory? But thanks be to God Who gives us the victory!\" He said, \"Death, tell me where you can make me holler! Grave, tell me how you going to hold me! For, I am a possessor of Eternal Life.\" Amen! He recognized it. Death, hell, grave, nothing could hold him. And nothing can hurt us, got Eternal Life! He realized he was blessed with Eternal Life. [I Corinthians 15:55]\n\nL-119 Just like a little dewdrop. If I understand, it's... I don't know too much about chemistry. But, it must be that it's the--the congealing of humidity or atmosphere. And when the night gets cold and dark, it falls from the heavens and drops upon the ground. It's fell from somewhere. But the next morning before the sun comes up, it's laying there, the little fellow, shivering. But just let the sun come up, watch it go to shining. It's happy. Why? The sun is going to call it right back to where it come from. And that's the way with a Christian. Hallelujah! We know when we walk into the Presence of God, something in us tells us that we come from somewhere, and we're going back again by that Power that's a pulling us.\n\nL-120 The little dewdrop, he glistens and shines and shouts, because he knows he come from up there, and that sun is going to draw him right back up again.And a man that's an attribute of God, born of God, knows, hallelujah, when he come in contact with the Son of God, he is going to be drawed up from here someday. \"For if I be lifted up from the earth, I'll draw all men unto Me.\" Amen! [John 12:32]\n\nL-121 Now notice, now, we see Melchisedec and why that Mary wasn't His mother. That's the reason He called her \"woman,\" not mother. \"He had no father,\" for He was the Father, the everlasting Father, the three in the One. \"He had no mother,\" certainly not. He had no father, for He was the Father. As the poet said one time, speaking a great compliment unto Jesus, he said: I AM that spoke to Moses in a burning bush of fire, I AM the God of Abraham, the Bright and Morning Star. I AM Alpha, Omega, the beginning from the end. I AM the whole creation, and Jesus is the Name. (That's right.) Oh, who do you say that I am, and whence do they say that I came, Do you know My Father, or can you tell His Name? (Hallelujah!)\n\nL-122 That's the Father's Name! Yeah, \"I come in My Father's Name, and you received Me not.\" See? Sure, He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. [John 5:43], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-123 And this Melchisedec became flesh. He revealed Himself as Son of man when He come, as a Prophet. He come in three names of a Son; the Son of man, the Son of God, the Son of David.\n\nL-124 When He was here on earth, He was a Man, to fulfill the Scripture. Moses said, \"The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet liken unto me.\" So He had to come as a Prophet. He didn't, never say, \"I am the Son of God.\" He said, \"I am the Son of man. Do you believe the Son of man?\" Cause, that's what He had to testify of, because that's what He was. Now He's come in another son's Name, Son of God; the unseen, the Spirit. And when He comes again, He is Son of David, to set upon His throne. [Deuteronomy 18:18]\n\nL-125 Now when He was here and was made flesh, He was called, \"the Son of man.\" Now, how did He make Himself known to the world as Son of man, the Prophet?\n\nL-126 One day I was telling a story of Peter and Andrew, his brother. They were fishermen, and their father Jonas was a great old believer. One day they said he set down on the side of the boat. He said, \"Sons, you know how we've prayed when we needed fish.\" They was commercial fishermen. He said, \"We've trusted God, Jehovah, for our living. And I'm getting old now; I can't stay with you boys much longer. And I've always, as all true believers, have looked for the time when that Messiah will come. We've had all kinds of false ones, but there is coming a real One, someday.\" And he said, \"When this Messiah comes, I don't want you boys to be deceived. This Messiah will not be just a theologian. He will 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min be a Prophet, for our prophet Moses, of who we follow, he said.\"Now, any Jew will believe his prophet. He is taught to know that. And if the prophet says anything that's so, then that's truth. But God said, \"If there be one among you, spiritual, or a prophet, I the Lord will make Myself known to him. And what he says comes to pass, then hear him and fear him; but if it don't, then don't fear him at all.\" See? So that was the--the vindication of the prophet. [Deuteronomy 18:22]\n\nL-127 \"So Moses was truly a vindicated prophet, and he said, 'The Lord your God shall raise up, among you, out of your brethren, a Prophet like unto me. And all that won't hear him will be cut off from the people.'\" He said, \"Now, children, remember, that, as Hebrews, we believe God's vindicated prophets.\"Now listen close. Don't miss it. And he said, \"When the Messiah comes, you will know Him, for He will be a Prophet-Messiah. Now, they said it's been four hundred years. We haven't had a prophet since Malachi, but he'll be!\" [Deuteronomy 18:15]\n\nL-128 One day, after his death, few years, his son Andrew was strolling along down the bank. And he heard a wild man out of the wilderness, saying, \"That Messiah is standing among you now!\" That big eagle that raised up over in the wilderness and flew over there, said, \"The Messiah is among you right now. We don't know Him yet, but He is standing among you. I'll know Him, because I'll see a sign coming from Heaven.\"One day he said, \"There, behold, is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!\"Away went the... went this man, to find his brother. He said, \"Simon, I want you come over here; we've done found the Messiah.\"\"Oh, go on, Andrew! You know better than that!\"\"Oh, I know. But, that, this Man is different.\"\"Where is He? Where'd He come from?\"\"Jesus of Nazareth.\"\"That little, wicked city? Why, He couldn't come from a wicked, dirty place like that.\"\"You just come and see.\" [John 1:29]\n\nL-129 Finally persuaded him to come down one day. So when he come in the front of this Messiah, Jesus standing there, speaking to the people. When he walked up in front of Him, He said, \"Your name is Simon, and you are the son of Jonas.\" That did it. He got the keys to the Kingdom. Why? He knowed that that Man did not know him. And how did He know him, and that godly old father who had taught him how to believe the Messiah? [John 1:41-42]\n\nL-130 There was a man standing there, by the name of Philip. Oh, he got real excited! He knowed another man, had been studying the Bible with. Away he went, around the hill, and he found him out there in his olive grove. He was kneeling down, praying. They had had lots of Bible lessons together, so he come out there. And he said, after he had got through praying, he said, \"Come, see Who we found; Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. He's the Messiah we're looking for.\"Now I can hear Nathanael say, \"Now, Philip, you ain't went off on the deep end, are you?\" [John 21:17]\n\nL-131 \"Oh, no. Nope. Now let me tell you. You know, we been studying the Bible together, and what did the prophet say the Messiah would be?\" \"He would be a Prophet.\" \"You remember that old fisherman you bought the fish from, that didn't have enough education to sign his name, called Simon?\" \"Yeah. Uh-huh.\"\n\nL-132 \"He come up. And you know what? This Jesus of Nazareth told him that his name was Simon, changed his name to Peter, which is 'little stone\" and told him who his daddy was.\" \"Well,\" he said--he said, \"I don't know. Could anything good come out of Nazareth?\" [John 1:45-46]\n\nL-133 He said, \"Let's not talk about it; just come on and see.\" That's a good idea, \"Come and see.\" So here come Philip, bringing up Nathanael. And when he got walking up, Jesus probably standing, speaking, probably praying for the sick in the prayer line. And when he come up to where Jesus was, Jesus looked around at him, and said, \"Behold an Israelite in whom there is not guile.\" [John 1:46-48]\n\nL-134 Now, you say, \"Well, it was the way he was dressed.\" Oh, no. All easterners dress the same. He could have been a Syrian, or been anything else; beard, garment.\n\nL-135 He said, \"Behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile,\" in otherwise, \"a honest, sincere man.\"Well, that kind of deflated Nathanael. And he said, \"Rabbi,\" which means, \"teacher.\" \"Rabbi, when did You ever know me? How did You know I was a Jew? How did You know I was honest, no guile?\" [John 1:47] 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min\n\nL-136 He said, \"Before Philip called you, when you were under the tree, I saw you.\" Uh! Fifteen miles away, the other side of the country, the day before.What did he say? \"Rabbi, You are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel!\" [John 1:48]\n\nL-137 But there stood those priests there, self-styled, self-starched, said, \"This man is Beelzebub, a fortuneteller.\" Jesus said, \"I'll forgive you for that.\"\n\nL-138 Now, remember, they never said it out loud, but they said it in their hearts. \"And He perceived their thoughts.\" That's right. That's what the Bible says. Call it telepathy if you want to, but He--He perceived their thoughts. [Luke 20:19]\n\nL-139 And He said, \"I forgive you for that. But someday the Holy Ghost is going to come and do this same thing,\" after His going; \"speak a word against It, will never be forgiven in this world or the world to come.\" Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now, that were Jews.Then one day He had need to go to Samaria. But just before we do that, we found the woman, or the... [Matthew 12:32]\n\nL-140 The man, as he went through the gate called Beautiful, that he was healed. And Jesus knowed his condition, and told him, \"Take up your bed and go on home.\" And he did it, and got well.Then we find out, the Jews, some of them received Him. Some believed it; some didn't. Why didn't they believe it? They was not ordained to Life. They wasn't part of that attribute. [Acts 3:2]\n\nL-141 Now remember, them were priests and great man. And Jesus... Think of those theologians and priests, man that you couldn't find a flaw in their life. Jesus said, \"You are of your father the devil, and his works you do.\" Said, \"If you'd be of God, you would believe Me. If you can't believe Me, believe the--believe the works that I do; they testify Who I am.\" [John 8:44]\n\nL-142 Now, the Bible said, that, \"Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" Jesus said, \"The works that I do shall he that believeth on Me do also.\" That right? Notice, that was the real Melchisedec now. [John 14:12]\n\nL-143 Now notice, again, there was only three races of people. You've heard me say I was a segregationalist. I am. All Christians are segregationalists; not segregation of color, but segregation of spirit. A man's color of his skin has nothing to do with him. He is a child of God by Birth. But a Christian, God said, \"Separate Me!\" \"Come out from among them,\" and so forth. He is a segregationist, of filth, between right and wrong. [Revelation 18:1-5]\n\nL-144 But notice, they had a segregation then, a racial segregation, which was the Samaritans. And there is only three races of people on the earth; if we believe the Bible; that is, Ham, Shem, and Japheth's people. That's the three sons of Noah. We all sprung from there. That's right. That makes us all back from Adam, which makes us all brothers. The Bible said, \"Of one blood God created all nations.\" We're all brothers, through the blood stream. A colored man can give a white man a blood transfusion, or vise versa. The white man can give the--the Japanese, yellow man, or the Indian, the red man, or whatmore, or a Japhenite, or whatever, he could give him a blood transfusion, 'cause we're all the same blood. The color of our skin, where we lived, had nothing to do with it. But when we're segregated, is when we come out of the world, like He brought Israel up out of Egypt. That's when we're segregated from the things of the world. [Genesis 9:18-19]\n\nL-145 Now, they was Ham, Shem, and Japheth's people. And if we had time to run the genealogies back, you could see the Anglo-Saxon, where he come from. Now, that was the Jew... The Samaritan, which was half Jew and Gentile, that married in with the Gentiles at Baalam's doings, and Moab. They were Samaritans. And there was Jews and Gentiles.Now, we Anglo-Saxon had nothing to do with any of it. We didn't believe any Messiah, nor nothing else. We wasn't looking for one. We were brought in afterwards.Jesus came to His Own, and His Own received Him not. And He said to His disciples, \"Don't go in the way of the Gentiles, but go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.\" And He went only to the lost sheep of Israel. And watch, He manifested Hisself as Son of man, before the Jews. They turned It down.Now, the Samaritan, being half Jew and Gentile, they believed also, and was looking for a Messiah.We wasn't. We were heathens, with clubs on our back, worshipping idols; the Gentile. [Matthew 10:5-6], [Genesis 9:18-19] 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min\n\nL-146 But now one day, Saint John 4, He had need to go by Samaria, on His road down to Jericho. But was went up around Samaria. And while He was going up there, He set down on the well outside of a city called Sychar. And the well, if you've ever been there, it's a little panoramic about like this here. And there's a public spring there, of water, where they all come. And the woman come of a morning, get their pots of water, and put it on their head, and one on each hip, and walk with it just as straight as can be, never spill a drop; talk to one another. So, they would, the people would come out there.\n\nL-147 So this was about eleven o'clock in the day. So He sent His disciples into the city, to buy some victuals, food. And while they were gone...\n\nL-148 There was a woman which was ill-famed. We would call her, today, a redlight woman, or prostitute. She had too many husbands. So while Jesus was setting there, this woman come out about eleven o'clock. See, she couldn't come with the virgins when they come in the morning to get their wash water; she had to wait till they all... They didn't mix like they do now. She was marked. So then, she come out to get some water, so she just took the old windle, and put the hooks over the jar, and started to let it down.She heard Somebody say, \"Woman, bring Me a drink.\" Now, remember, this is Melchisedec. This is Jesus, yesterday, the Son of man. [John 4:7]\n\nL-149 And she looked around, and she saw a Jew. So she said, \"Sir, it's not proper for a Jew to ask a Samaritan for anything. I'm a woman of Samaria, so You have spoken out of Your place. You shouldn't have asked me such a thing as that. We have no dealings with one another.\" [John 4:9]\n\nL-150 He said, \"But if you knew Who was talking to you, you would ask Me for a drink.\"She said, \"How You going to draw it? The well is deep, and You have nothing to draw with.\" [John 4:10-11]\n\nL-151 He said, \"The water that I give is Water of Life, springing up into Eternal Life.\"He talked to her till He found what her condition was. And then is... Watch what He said to her now, \"Go get your husband and come here.\"And she said, \"I have no husband.\" [John 4:16]\n\nL-152 He said, \"You have said the truth, for you've had five, and the one you now are living with is not yours. So, in this, you've said the truth.\"Watch the difference between that woman and that bunch of priests. She knowed more about God than that whole bunch of priests did, put together. [John 4:17-18]\n\nL-153 She said, \"Sir, I perceive that You are a Prophet.\" She said, \"We haven't had one for four hundred years. Now, we know that the Messiah is coming. And when the Messiah comes, that's what He is going to do.\" That was the sign of the Messiah, for He was the Son of man. Said, \"That's what He is going to do when He comes. You must be His prophet.\" [John 4:19]\n\nL-154 He said, \"I am He.\" Nobody else could say that.\n\nL-155 She dropped that waterpot and run into the city, and said, \"Come, see a Man Who told me what I done. Isn't this the very Messiah?\"Now remember, He promised to do that same thing at the end of the Gentile race.The Jews had had four thousand years to look for that Messiah, four thousand years of teaching He was coming, and what He would do when He got there, and they failed to see Him, or failed to recognize it. And when He made Hisself known in the very Bible terms that He said He would, when He had been a theophany and then become flesh and dwelt among them, they failed to see it, and called His works the works of the devil. [John 4:29]\n\nL-156 Now we've had two thousand years of teaching, coming down through the Roman Catholic church, after the apostles. Then we come down through the Roman Catholic, the Greek, and so forth, on down to Luther's age, and Wesley, whatmore, nine hundred different organizations coming down. They had all these ages, teaching.Now He promised, just before the end time would come, that the picture of Sodom and Gomorrah would again, \"As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the end time, the Son of man will reveal Himself again.\" [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]\"Yet a little while and the world won't see Me no more; yet ye shall see Me, for I,\" a personal pronoun, \"I will be with you, even in you, to the consummation, the end of the world. I'll be with you.\" He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. You see? [Luke 17:26-27], [John 14:19] 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min\n\nL-157 You see, the Samaritan was, actually, from my last night's sermon, was Hagar, see, a perverted type. The Jew was Sarah, or was Sarah-ite. But the Gentile is of Mary, the Royal Seed, Abraham's Royal Seed.\n\nL-158 Now it's promised that in these last days, that, this same God, this same Christ, would come back here and reveal Hisself as Son of man.Why? He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And if He'd let those Jews go by with, and give them that Messianic sign, and then come to the end of the Gentile's teaching and let them just go in on theology, He would be unjust. He has got to do the same thing, because the Bible said, in thir-... Hebrews 13:8, \"He is the same.\"And He has promised in Malachi 4, and all the different Scriptures, that, the last days, the church would be setting just exactly like it is today, and the world would be. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-159 Look at the world today. Look at the Sodom condition. Look at the earthquakes in divers places, and the things that's taking place. Look at the church and the mess it's in, of Babylon. Look at the messenger to it, an Oral Roberts and a Billy Graham.G-r-a-h-a-m, first time we ever had a messenger, to all the churches, that his name ever end in h-a-m, like Abraham. A-b-r-a-h-a-m is seven letters. G-r-a-h-a-m is six letters. Where is he at? To the world. Six is man's number. Man was created on the sixth day. But seven is God's number. [Matthew 24:7]\n\nL-160 Now look at them down there in Sodom. And there is their messengers down there speaking to them.But then where is that royal Seed of Abraham? Where is their sign, that He said? \"As it was in the days of Sodom,\" that God came down and was manifested in human flesh, and told what Sarah was thinking back in her heart, in the tent behind Him, the last sign before the Gentile world was destroyed by fire. And the Church has got its last sign before the whole world is going to be destroyed, this Gentile kingdom be destroyed by the fire and wrath of God. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] [Genesis 18:9, 15]\n\nL-161 That Melchisedec was flesh, represented Himself in a human body; and then later He was made flesh. And now, tonight, He is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. Do you believe it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-162 Who is this Melchisedec, then, that's the same yesterday, today...\" Never had no father, never had no mother; He never had no beginning of days, He never had any end of life.\" And He met Abraham, and what kind of a sign did He perform? Then when He was made flesh, He said it would repeat again just before the end time. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] I believe it. [\"Amen.\"] Let's pray.\n\nL-163 Dear God, I believe the Scriptures, that You have said You was \"the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" And as sincerely in my heart, Lord, I know that something is fixing to take place. I cannot strictly identify it. I'm afraid to say anything, Lord. Thou knowest the heart of Your servant's.\n\nL-164 And how many times, down through the age when You sent things, people failed to get it. Man is constantly praising God for what He did, and saying what great things He is going to do, but ignoring what He's doing. So has it been through the age. Why did the Roman church fail to see Saint Patrick as God's prophet? Why did they kill Joan of Arc when she was a--a prophetess, burnt her as a witch? Father, it's always past. You hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent. No wonder You said to them priests, \"You garnish the tombs of the prophets, and you're the one that put them in there.\" After they're gone, they see their mistake. They always persecute You, Lord, in whatever form You come in. [Matthew 23:29]\n\nL-165 I pray, tonight, God, just one more time. Tomorrow we're scheduled to be... to go to Tucson. Other parts of the world, other cities we must preach in. But, Dear God, there might be strangers here tonight that never has... They've heard Words preached, but never seen It made manifest.As I asked You at the beginning. When those disciples, Cleopas and his friend, coming from Emmaus, was walking along the road, and You stepped out of the bush and begin to talk to them, after the resurrection, preached to them. Why, He said, \"Fools, slow of heart. Don't you know that Christ should suffer these things, then enter into His glory?\" But still they never recognized it. All day long they walked with You, and still didn't know You. But one night...Night come, they constrained You to come in. When they went into the little inn and closed the doors, then You did something just the way You did it before Your crucifixion, and they recognized it was the risen Christ. In a few moments You was behind the curtains and gone. Quickly they run 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min and told the disciples, \"The Lord is risen indeed!\" [Luke 24:18, 45]\n\nL-166 Father, God, I believe that You're still alive. I know You are. And You've proved it to us so many time. Could You just do it once more for us, Lord? If we found grace in Your sight, let it happen once more. I am Your servant; these are Your servants in here. Lord, all that I've said wouldn't mount to... Just one word from You would be more than I've said in these five nights, or five messages. It would be more, just one word from You. Won't You speak, Lord, that the people might know that I've told them the Truth? Grant it, God. I ask it in Jesus' Name, this once more. Amen.\n\nL-167 Now, I don't know you. I know some people. I know this boy setting here. I know Bill Dauch setting right there. I want to... Here is Brother Blair, Rodney Cox. It's hard to see out there. On this side, right at the present time I can't see nobody, actually, that I know.\n\nL-168 Now how many in here that knows that I am a stranger to you? Raise up your hands, knows that I know nothing about you, raise up your hands on both sides.How many in here that has something wrong, or something that you know that I know nothing about? Would you raise up your hands.Now, it would be totally, absolutely totally impossible for me to know anything about you. Otherwise, then, it'd have to come from some revelation of Spirit.And being that I've told you all these nights, and tonight, that He is not dead; He is here, and promised to do the same thing. And promised that there would come a time in the last days, according to Malachi 4 and according to Saint Luke, that He would appear again in human form among His people and do the same things, and reveal the same thing, the same Messianic sign. How many knows that, you Bible readers, knows that's the Truth? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Must all be Bible readers. [Malachi 4:5], [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-169 Now, I know it's foreign to the people today, but still it's the Truth. That's the reason they didn't know Jesus of Nazareth. They knowed their church creeds, but they didn't know Him. But He come just the way the Bible said; not a theologian, not a priest. He come as a Prophet, and His Own received Him not.\n\nL-170 Now, if God will keep His Word, and if I happen to... it happens to fall on someone that I know, then I'll--I'll get someone else. See, I want somebody that I don't know. And I want you to pray.\n\nL-171 Now, look, there was a little woman one time had an infirmity. She had spent her money for the doctors; they could do her no good. And she said within her heart, \"If I can touch that Man's garments, I'll be made well.\" You remember the story? And so all of them tried to get her to stay back, but she pressed through until she touched His garment, went back and set down. [Matthew 9:20]\n\nL-172 Now listen close. And then when He did that, when she did that, Jesus turned around and said, \"Who touched Me?\"\n\nL-173 Why, Peter the apostle rebuked Him. He might have said something like, \"Lord, don't say a thing like that. The people will believe there is something wrong with You. Because, when You asked them to eat Your flesh and drink Your Blood, they already think there is something wrong. And You say, 'Who touched Me?' Why, the whole crowd is a-touching You.\" [Luke 8:45]\n\nL-174 He said, \"Yes, but I perceive that virtue went out of Me.\" That was a different kind of touch. Now, anybody knows that virtue is \"strength.\" \"I got weak; virtue left Me.\"And He looked around on the audience until He found the little woman, and told her about her blood issue. And she felt in her body that that blood issue had stopped. Is that right? And He said, \"Thy faith has saved thee.\"Now, the Greek word there is sozo, which absolutely means \"saved,\" physically or spiritual, just the same. He \"saved.\" He is--He is your Saviour. [Luke 7:50]\n\nL-175 Now, if that was Him yesterday, and the way He acted, to prove that He was among the people, the Messiah promised; and that's the way He identified Himself, and promise by the Bible, He would do the same thing now; wouldn't He, wouldn't He have to do the same thing?\n\nL-176 You say, \"Did He say about healing the sick?\" Yeah!The Hebrews, the Bible that I just read from, said that, \"Jesus Christ now is our High Priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities.\" How many knows that true? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] The Bible said that. \"He's the High Priest now that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities.\" Then if He's the same High Priest that He was then, how would He act now? He would have to act the 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min same way He did then, if He's the same High Priest. Now, you might...I'm not your High Priest. You might touch me, and it'd be just like touching your husband, or your brother, or whatmore, a man. [Hebrews 4:15]\n\nL-177 But you let your faith touch Him, and watch what happens. Now, if I be God's servant and have told you the Truth, God will vindicate that to be the Truth. And that would prove that Jesus Christ is a living tonight, standing here. Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now, you have faith, just one side at a time, one side. You have faith out there. I better stay at the microphone here, because they can't hear me.\n\nL-178 Somebody just look up to God, and say, \"God, that man don't know me. He knows nothing about me. I'm a perfect stranger to him. But let my faith touch You, Lord. And You know what's the matter with me, Lord. You know all about me. You know who I am, the same as You knowed who Peter was, same as You knowed Nathanael, as You knowed what was wrong with the woman with the blood issue. And this man tells me that You're 'the same yesterday, today, and forever.' Then, Lord, let my faith touch You.\" And if He'll do that, and infallibly prove Himself here, how many of you will believe Him with all your heart; if He'll do it at least one, or two, or three people, for a--for a witness? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] God bless you. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-179 Now, Father God, this is totally out of the hands of any man. It would have to be supernatural phenomena. So I pray that You'll help me now, Lord. I'm in Your hands. Do with me as You see fit. In Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-180 Now, don't be nervous. Just humbly, reverently say, \"Lord, I'll serve You. And that'll be a truth, that, if I can touch Your garment, then You speak back through that man. That will prove to me that what he said is the Truth.\" That right?\n\nL-181 How many ever seen the picture of that Light? It's all over the country, everywhere. Science has took it and examined it, and everywhere. Now, He is right here now; same One that said about Marriage And Divorce, same One was on the mountain, shook the hills back there, same One that's down here at the river in '33, the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's the same.\n\nL-182 Now, there is a woman, and she recognizes now that something has happened. That Light is hanging right over her. She is setting right here, green sweater on, or something. I don't know the woman. I suppose we are strangers to one another. That is right. Do you believe that God... You're--you're in need of something, and you believe that God can reveal to me what your trouble is? And if He does, then you know it'll have to be a supernatural power, because I don't know you. And it'll have to come through supernatural. Depends upon what you think it is. You can take your side with the priests, call it \"the devil,\" or you can take the side with the believer and call it \"God.\" Ever which you believe, that's where your reward will come from.\n\nL-183 If God will reveal to me your trouble, will you accept Him as your--your atonement for that trouble? I don't know what the trouble is. But I know, and you know, that something is going on.\n\nL-184 Now, now just let me tell you how you're feeling, and then you'll know; a real warm, sweet, comfortable feeling. I'm looking right straight at It. It's that Light, amber Light hanging from the woman. And the lady is suffering with a trouble in her stomach. It's a kind of a growths, like, in her stomach. She is not from here. [The sister says, \"Right.\"] No. You're from away from here aren't you? That's right. You're from Wisconsin. Is that right? Sure. Now you are healed. Your faith has made you whole.\n\nL-185 Now tell me Who the woman touched? I'm twenty-five yards from her. She touched Jesus Christ, the High Priest. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-186 I'm looking at a woman that I talked to. This woman, I'm looking right at her, 'cause she is praying so hard for a man. She told me she had a man... She never told me nothing about it. But her name is Mrs. Waldrop. She comes from Phoenix. She was raised from the dead, and her doctor come with the x-rays and showed cancer in the heart. She died in the prayer line. How long ago has that been, Mrs. Waldrop? Eighteen years ago, and there she sets tonight, a living testimony. Her doctor has come to the meeting, brought the... 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min Said, \"How can the woman live?\" But there she is, and no sign of it.\n\nL-187 She has brought someone, and she is praying for him. Now, he is dying, with diabetes. Now, that I knew. But being that you are praying... You know I don't know who he is, Mrs. Waldrop.\n\nL-188 He is from Missouri, and his name is Mr. Cooper. That is right. Now, you believe, you can go back home and be well, sir. It's up to you, if you'll believe it.\n\nL-189 Here is a woman, and she is suffering with a asthmatic condition, complications. She is not from here. She is setting out there in the crowd, right out there. I hope she gets... She is not from here. She is from Georgia. Miss McKenny. Do you believe with all your heart, and believe that God will make you well? Stand up on your feet, if you're a stranger to me and that is true. Jesus Christ heals you. Do you believe? [Brother Branham has his back to the congregation--Ed.]\n\nL-190 To my back, there is a man setting behind me. He is contacting God. And what he's wanting; he has got a baby that's got heart trouble. And that baby has got a murmur in his heart, so the doctor said. And that man's name is Mr. Cox. Stand up, Mr. Cox. \"And He told Sarah what she was thinking, behind Him.\" [Brother Branham continues to keep his back to the congregation--Ed.]\n\nL-191 Right across the aisle from him, back a little farther, is a man who comes not from here, but from New Mexico. I never seen him, in my life. I'm looking right at him now, and he is behind me. He is from New Mexico. And the man has a girl that he is interested in, and the girl has got something wrong with her mouth. It's a... The palate in her mouth is what's wrong. And the man's name is Mr. West. Would you stand up, sir. I'm a total stranger to him, but the Lord God will heal his child.\n\nL-192 Do you believe now with all your heart? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] How many of you believe now with all your heart? [\"Amen.\"] Now, isn't Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever? [\"Amen.\"] Do you accept Him now as your Saviour? Raise your hand. [\"Amen.\"] Do you believe in Him as your Healer? [\"Amen.\"]\n\nL-193 Here, here is a person setting here, crippled or something, laying on a cot. Can you hear me through this mike? [Brother Branham takes a microphone and walks toward the edge of the platform and talks to the woman on the cot--Ed.] I don't know you. You're just a woman laying there. If I could heal you, I would do it. I can't heal you. [A man begins weeping--Ed.] All right. It's just a man who is rejoicing. His child was healed. I don't know you. You're a woman, and I'm a man. This is the first time we've met in life, I suppose. These people...?... that brought you. Frankly, this is your first time here; just brought you in. You come from a long way. You are shadowed to death. You have cancer. It's not cripple. It's a cancer. The doctors can't do no more for you. It's true. And you're sure to die; those doctors can do no more for you.\n\nL-194 One time there was three lepers set at the gate of Samaria. And them lepers said, \"Why do we set here till we die?\" Because, all the sickness, starving to death, and eating one another's children. They said, \"If we go down to the enemy's camp, the Syrians; if they kill us, we're going to die, anyhow. And if they save us, we'll live.\" And they took that chance. And, by that faith, they not only saved theirself but the whole group. [II Kings 7:3]\n\nL-195 Now, you're going to die if you lay there. But you're not asked to go to the camp that they did. But you're invited to the house of the Father,...?...\n\nL-196 You are dying with cancer. You can't live outside of God. You're not from this city. You're not from around here. You've come a long way. You're from Milwaukee. That's true. That's right. I seen the city. I know it. That's right. Do you believe? Will you accept God now as your healer? If you will, no matter how weak you are, how bedfast you are, I believe, in your case, I would rise up in the Name of Jesus Christ. And take that cot and go home, and live to the glory of God. Will you obey me, as God's prophet? Then rise up and go, and be well. Be well! Don't be scared. Get up off the cot; God will make you well. See?\n\nL-197 Somebody hold her so she can get up and get strength. Do you believe God? Just let her get a little strength; she'll be all right. That's it, sister. There she is, in the Name of the Lord Jesus! [Congregation rejoices as the sister is now 65-0221E, Who Is This Melchisedec?, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 109 min standing.] Let us stand and give praise to God.

And we're under great anticipation for the evening. The public is cordially invited, everybody, every church of every denomination. You don't even have to be a Christian; we certainly are calling for sinners to come in, set among us. And we do our very best to teach them what is the way of the Lord, that we might live.\n\nL-5 Now I hope that the audience will not be nervous. And I trusting to God that I will not be nervous, for I've had a tremendous night, a lot of strain. For I realize that the things that I say this morning will be held against me in the Day of the Judgment, and I--I couldn't sleep, and I know if I don't say them it'll be held against me in the Day of Judgment. So it makes it hard, you can't explain it.\n\nL-6 And now this morning is that great subject we're to discuss on Marriage And Divorce. And the reason I made it Sunday school, so that we could talk about it and take our time, instead of preaching a sermon on it. It's a teaching from the Scripture.\n\nL-7 And I--I want to say that, if any minister or ministers, any place, should this tape ever fall into their hands, if we release this tape. I don't know what the church will do about it. I'm asking Brother Fred to see the church board before he releases this tape. And to you people out across the nation, that's got tape recorders setting, please don't let the tape out unless you hear from Brother Sothmann about it.\n\nL-8 Now, and if it is let loose, and any of my minister brothers, or any Christian anywhere, that would disagree upon the things that I am saying about this subject, I--I trust that you will not criticize It. If you don't understand It the way that I teach It, well, you have a right to that, as a minister, as a shepherd. And I respect anything that you believe.\n\nL-9 And there is two great schools on this. And if there is two questions, there is either one of them got to be right, or neither one of them is right. So we're going to try to look to the Word of God, this morning, to settle this. To me, if it's a Bible question, the Bible surely has the answer to it.\n\nL-10 And now just before we have these, start this subject, rather, before I pray over the Word, I want to express to each one of you, that I... you Christians especially, that I desire... I--I want you to pray for me this morning. And all out in the unseen audience that's listening in this morning, pray for me, because I want to be honest and truthful. 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min\n\nL-11 Now we realize, in making these statements, somebody, if it's only one person, will hang onto It like It was between life and death. There is many of you here will go away believing. Course, many of you, perhaps, won't. But I know, in my ministry, there is people who come to listen at me, and listen to what I've got to say; from, well, they're sitting right here this morning, internationally, from many of the United States, Canada, and across the seas. And you can imagine the strain that it puts you, to know that that man's Eternal destination lays in your hands, 'cause he is going to hold onto what you say. So God would make me answer for it, and I want to approach this just as sincerely as I can.\n\nL-12 Now I--I ask our sisters. And I altered some of my words so that I could speak it before them. Billy has in his pocket, this morning, out there, some things that could not be said out before a--a mixed audience. And some that I probably will say, you must understand. Take it as from--from your brother, to the best that I know. You would sit in a doctor's office and listen to him, he would have to say very plain words to you. And some of you young ladies and young man, I don't want you to get the wrong impression. I want you to believe, and just sit still. Remember, Truth has got to be stated Truth.\n\nL-13 And, now, no doubt but there'll be many of you disagree with what is to be said, but I want to prove it to you by the Bible. And then I believe, if you'll just be reverent and listen, then you'll have a better understanding and conception of what I've been hammering at, all along. I believe this will explain it, and I trust that it will.\n\nL-14 Now we may be a little lengthy, an hour and a half, or maybe longer, on this. I don't know how long it will take.\n\nL-15 And now again, I'd like to say that, in this time, that, knowing that people holds to your words; they do, to their pastor. And, of course, I've been a pastor.\n\nL-16 And they hold to a pastor's words, just like it was between death and life. They hold to their priest's words, just like it was death and life. And of course, the pastor, perhaps with all that he knows how to do, he is teaching his people just exactly like he was taught in the seminary; no doubt but what the priest, also, in the different religions that have priests. Course, the pastor really is a priest; it's an intercessor. So, if the priest, in all that he is taught in his, in the seminary and the monasteries, the man with deep sincerity is telling just exactly what he is taught.\n\nL-17 Well, then, I don't have any seminary experience or monastery experience, and nothing against it at all, but I have a very peculiar life.\n\nL-18 I was called when I was just a little boy. And in this was a visible, audible sign given me, a--a Pillar of Fire hanging in a bush, at seven years old, right here on the Utica Pike. My father was working for Mr. O. H. Wathen that just recently died. And you've read the book, you know the story. And from that time... Down on the river then It appeared visibly before the people. And now It's had the picture taken, many times, and it hangs in Washington, D.C., as a copyright, in the Religious Hall of Art, as the only supernatural Being that was ever scientifically proven to be photographed; same Pillar of Fire, exactly in the same look and every way, that brought Israel out of Egypt. I believe It's Jesus Christ in Spirit form, in the Sonship of God. [Exodus 14:19-20], [Numbers 14:14], [Numbers 12:5], [Revelation 10:1], [Acts 9:8], [Acts 26:13-15]\n\nL-19 For He was called \"Son of man\" when He come first, now He is called \"Son of God,\" in the Millennium He'll be \"Son of David.\" He come Son of man, a prophet, as was spoke of Him; now He is Son of God, in supernatural; in the great Millennium that is to come, He'll be Son of David, setting on the throne of David. As all Bible readers know that that's a Divine promise with God, to David, He would raise up His Son to set on his throne. [Luke 17:30], [Luke 9:22], [John 5:27-28], [Mark 10:33], [John 3:18], [II Corinthians 1:19], [Matthew 1:1], [Matthew 21:9]\n\nL-20 And now in an odd, peculiar ministry, I have been called everything from \"God\" to \"a devil.\" And that, just it always is that way.\n\nL-21 That's what this archbishop of the Catholic church said to me the other night down there, the discussion was, that he said, \"Brother Branham, John the Baptist clearly identified himself in the Scriptures, as spoken by the prophet Isaiah.\" He said, \"Your ministry is clearly identified in the Church.\" He said, \"The Lutherans are in the Bible.\" He said, \"Lutherans knowed Luther. Wesleys know Wesley. But what about the Pentecostals?\" Said, \"They're wandering. They don't know where to go.\" 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min And I said, \"Sir, I appreciate that.\"\n\nL-22 And it was that time the Spirit fell upon the lady, had never seen me, his wife... and spoke and identified the same things.\n\nL-23 Now, to be honest, before this Message I speak this morning, I don't know. I told him, I said, \"Sir, I couldn't say that. That's a great big thing to say. It looks like it.\"\n\nL-24 One thing that I know, that there is something has took place, definitely. All these things, just, it's scientifically proven, and proven around and around the world, it can't be just a myth. It's Truth. What is it? Let me say, confessionally, before I speak to you this morning, I don't know. And I would be daresn't to make any move until I heard from Him that has talked to me in the past and told me these things.\n\nL-25 Remember, our Lord Jesus Christ never did identify Himself as the Son of God. He said, \"You said I was; to this end I was born,\" and so forth, but He never identified Himself.\n\nL-26 And, now, that was the Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel, was the Lord Jesus Christ in Spirit form, (do you believe that?) the Logos that went out of God. [Congregation said, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] [Acts 9:3-7]\n\nL-27 And then when He was on earth, He said, \"I come from God, and I go to God.\" We all know that. [John 8:42]\n\nL-28 And after His death, burial, and resurrection. Saul of Tarsus was on his road down to Damascus, to persecute the--the Christians, because they were teaching things contrary to what they had been taught. And he was a great warrior; under Gamaliel, one of the outstanding teachers of the day, in their school, their monastery; and a great man, and an officer of the church. And it was there that a great Light, the Pillar of Fire again, struck him down, in the middle of the day. And a Voice said, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?\" [Acts 9:4]\n\nL-29 Now if you notice when Paul, Saul, raised up, he said, \"Lord, Who are You?\" Now, that boy, being a Jew, he certainly wouldn't have called anything, unless it'd been something to symbol God, he wouldn't have called it \"Lord.\" So, It was the same Pillar of Fire. [Acts 9:5]\n\nL-30 As Jesus said, \"I go to God. I came from God, and I return to God.\" [John 8:42]\n\nL-31 There He was, back in the form of a Pillar of Fire again; He said, \"I am Jesus Whom thou persecutest; and it's hard for you to kick against the pricks.\" [Acts 9:5]\n\nL-32 And we realize that when the Apostle Peter, to who the keys was given to build the Church, we find out that he was in prison, and this same Pillar of Fire came through the bars, opened the doors of the prison, and took Peter out, mysteriously, without even disturbing the guard. To me, It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. , [Acts 12:5-11]\n\nL-33 And then you'll always know anything by the nature of it. Anything is known by its nature, the fruit it bears. And I ask you to watch the kind of fruit It bears, this Light which is God, because It always goes back to the Word of God, and proves the Word of God, preaches the Word of God, and God proves that Word materially so before you. There has got to be something behind It.\n\nL-34 People has called me a prophet. I don't call myself no prophet, because I would be daresn't to say that, but I have... Say, I can say this, that the Lord has let me foresee things, tell things that has happened, will happen, is happening, and not one time has it ever failed, in the tens of thousands of times. Everything that He said would happen, happened. We all know that. If there is a person in this visible audience this morning, or anywhere, can say one time it failed, you're at liberty to stand up and say so. But if everybody knows that every time, of the thousands of times, it's been perfectly right, say, \"amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen!\"--Ed.] See? So that would be the same thing around the world.\n\nL-35 Something is just about to happen. God never sends these things without being a purpose behind it.\n\nL-36 I was just thinking here. I placed it here, one of my notes. That I'm wearing this morning, a set of cuff links... And many of you have heard of this movie star, Jane Russell, and her mother is a Pentecostal; and Danny Henry is her cousin, her first cousin, her mother's sister's child. He was Baptist. He was standing at the meeting, a Business Men's meeting in Los Angeles, California, two years ago. 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min\n\nL-37 And I had just got through speaking of a great, powerful, forceful statements; that even the overseer, one of the general overseers of the Assemblies of God, stepped down to the platform from up in the balcony where he was sitting, and he said, \"I don't believe that Brother Branham meant that.\"\n\nL-38 I said, \"I have to mean it, sir. It's THUS SAITH THE LORD.\" And, then, it was about the church in this age.\n\nL-39 And about that time, this young man who is a businessman... His brother is over... he was there taking pictures for television that morning, his other brother is--is a state road supervisor of California. And Danny Henry walked forward after the meeting was closed, on the platform, like this, where the men were all seated, walked down to put his arms around me. And he said these words, \"Brother Branham, I hope this don't sound sacrilegious, but,\" said, \"that could be made the 23rd chapter of Revelation.\" Which, there is only twenty-two chapters in Revelation. He said, \"I hope this don't sound sacrilegious.\" He had no more than said it... Now, the boy was a Baptist, and knowed nothing about the supernatural. With his arms around me, he started talking in an unknown language.\n\nL-40 And when he got through speaking in an unknown language, there was a--a heavyset, dark woman setting right in front of me, she raised up, said, \"That don't need any interpretation.\" She said, \"I am from Shreveport, Louisiana; or Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\" Said, \"That is clearly French.\"\n\nL-41 Victor Le Doux, which was a Frenchman, also setting up there, said, \"Certainly, I'm a Frenchman, and that was perfectly French.\"\n\nL-42 I said, \"Wait a minute. You write down what he said, and you write down what he said, before you say anything. Write down what you say, and let's see your notes.\" And so one wrote down, and the other wrote down, it was even the punctuation was the same.\n\nL-43 And then just about that time, when they brought the notes up, a fine-looking, young blond-headed boy come walking from the back. Where, there was not enough room for him to set down; he was standing up in the back. He come walking forth, said, \"Just a minute, I'd like to place a note, too.\" He said, \"I am the French interpreter for the U.N., United Nations.\" He said, \"I'd like to leave my note.\"\n\nL-44 And, here, all three notes exactly the same, of French. And here is the way it reads. This is the original notes taken, note taken right off. This is Danny's note, hisself, he packed in his pocket. Course, it went in the Christian Business Men, and so forth. Because thou hast chosen the narrow path, the harder way; thou hast walked in your own choosing. Thou hast picked the correct and precise decision, and it is My Way. Because of this momentous decision, a huge portion of Heaven will await thee. What a glorious decision thou hast made! This in itself is that which will give and make come to pass the tremendous victory in the love Divine.\n\nL-45 Now, the man signed his name here. \"The above statement was interpreted by, of Danny Henry prophesying over Brother Branham, given by three witnesses in the cafeteria in Los Angeles, California.\"\n\nL-46 Now, this same young man that give this prophecy, not knowing what he was saying, was in Jerusalem about a month ago. He had the privilege of going out and--and laying in the tomb where Jesus had died and was buried. And so while he was laying there, he said I come upon his mind real strong and he started weeping. Said, \"How that it has been so hard for Brother Branham to stand against the world and these things, and all churches!\"\n\nL-47 Like it--it was once said of one, of the Billy Graham part, said, \"We can see Billy Graham, 'cause all churches are united together for him. We see Oral Roberts, the Pentecostals. But how do we ever have anything, when It's contrary to what people have been taught?\" It's God.\n\nL-48 And, Danny, what he does for a hobby, he makes little stones. He walked out to where the Cross had been put down, where they said the Cross set in the rock. No one was around, so he broke off a little piece of rock and he put it into his pocket for a souvenir, come home and made me a pair of cuff links out of it. And, strangely, when he made them, they looked to be bloodstained. And right through each one of them, in continuity, runs a straight, narrow path 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min right through both of them. Now that might be just a... See, someone else might not notice it, but to me it's complimentary to the things I believe. I believe that everything has a meaning to it.\n\nL-49 And now, in this time, whatever the Lord has. If this isn't the thing that He prophesied of, of Malachi 4 and of also of Luke 17, and many other Scriptures that's to happen in this last day, may I say this in closing, it's laid the foundation for the man when he will come. So I am very thankful that God Almighty, if it be that way, has let me do a little something, in my uneducated condition, to show my appreciation of His love to me, my love to Him, and our love to the people. [Malachi 4:5-6], [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-50 Therefore, in sincerity, I approach this subject of Marriage And Divorce. May God have mercy on us all.\n\nL-51 And now listen closely. And, sisters, don't get up and go out; sit still just a little while. Brothers, do the same. Don't turn off your sets out there, that's coming on this hookup. Don't do that. Just sit still for a few minutes, until it's over. Listen close. If you disagree, put down the Scriptures that I use, and then study them prayerfully before you make your decision. God, help us as we try to approach this subject.\n\nL-52 Now, it may be a little lengthy. I don't want you to be in any hurry. And just take your time, all of us, and study the Word of God, truly and thoroughly, as we know how to study It.\n\nL-53 Let's begin with Saint Matthew, the 19th chapter. And beginning, I think, with the 8th verse of the 19th chapter, I wish to start. I might start also with the 1st, and read down to the 8th verse of the 19th chapter.\n\nL-54 Now, remember, these things that I say must come from the Word of God. It can't be my own opinion, 'cause my opinion is just like anybody else's. But it's got to be in continuity with the Word of God. Remember, God keeps everything in continuity. He never changes. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] He is the same. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-55 Now I shall read from the 19th chapter. And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan; And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them... The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him,... [Matthew 19:1-8]\n\nL-56 I pause there so you can get the emphasis on who it was that was tempting Him. ... saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? And he answered and said unto them, Have you not read, that he which made them in the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Therefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. They said unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and... put her away? And He said unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. Now, God, help us. [Matthew 19:3-8]\n\nL-57 This Scripture, this question, confronted Jesus at the very beginning of His ministry. And it confronted Moses at the very beginning of his ministry. It's a foremost question in believers' hearts. The sinner doesn't care. But it's to believers, because the believer is trying to do all that he knows how to do to live right before God. Therefore it, any question comes up on religion, then the Marriage And Divorce case comes up, (why?) because it is the cause of the original sin. That's where sin started. And that's the reason it's brought up every time, because it is the very beginning of sin. [Genesis 3:1-21] 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min\n\nL-58 Now I won't have time to explain all these things, but I'll be glad to answer your letter or anything I can. Or, we got the books wrote on it, and many questions, and even cuttings out of newspapers and things here, to prove this, we know that it was Eve. The apple that she was supposed to eat, where it's not even Scriptural, now they claim it was an apricot; it was neither one. She committed adultery, that brought forth the first child, which was Cain, Satan's own son, for in him laid evil. It did not come through Abel. Satan's son was Cain. [I John 3:12], [Genesis 4:1-8]\n\nL-59 I know your question now, \"Eve said, 'I have gotten a man from the Lord.'\" That's exactly right. [Genesis 4:1]\n\nL-60 You could take the orneriest woman in the town, the worst man; if they had a baby, it would have to come from the Lord, because God has laws set together. And these laws, like the sun to raise; you put a cocklebur in a good field, it'll grow. And it has to grow, because it's God's law. When seed is planted, it must grow. And nothing can grow life but God, because it operates under His laws. Therefore when the evil seed was planted in the womb of--of Eve, it had to bring forth, because it's God's law of production. And it could do nothing else but bring it, and it had to come from God. [Genesis 1:24-25]\n\nL-61 That's the reason that people say, \"Little babies,\" sometime, \"that's not born with Christian parents, are lost.\"\n\nL-62 Jesus Christ's Blood atones for the child, I don't care how much it was born and how evil it was born. He is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. The little child cannot repent, because it has nothing to repent for, and that was the sin of the world which was taken away by the Blood of Christ. Babies go to Heaven. [Mark 10:13-16], [Matthew 19:13-15], [Luke 18:15-17], [Matthew 18:10]\n\nL-63 It's original sin, and that's the reason it's--it's questioned. When any great phenomena comes from God, about the first thing: \"What about marriage and divorce?\" Now, as ever, it still is a question amongst the people. As it was in the times of Jesus, as it was in the times of Moses, it's always been, and is till this day, a question among the people, because the people want to know what's the Truth. [Genesis 3:1-21], [Malachi 2:14-16]\n\nL-64 But where there is a question, there must also be an answer. And now being an answer, as I have said before, this week, there must be a correct answer. And if we get an answer to anything, and it--it isn't right, then we know that it was wrong. But there is, you would still ask until the true question is answered, if you want to know Truth. And being this is a Bible question, it should be a Bible answer.\n\nL-65 It's like I have said, if I wanted to go east this morning; and the best that I knowed this, I had to find a certain something in the field, and it was directly east, and I went east. Somebody said, \"Brother Branham, this is east.\" It is east, potentially, but it's northeast. I would pass the very object I was looking for; I'd come back, knowing it was wrong. And then if somebody said, \"Brother Branham, go this way, to your right.\" Now, that is potentially east, also, but it's southeast. I would lose the object that I was looking for, because I went beyond the boundaries of the perfect and direct way.\n\nL-66 Now, if that be so, we have two schools of thought on Marriage And Divorce. And that is, one of them says, that, \"A man can only be married once, unless his wife is dead.\" And that's one of the questions, but, you go to following that, you go overboard. And then the next says, \"Oh, if the wife or the husband, either one, has committed adultery, either one of them can be put away and married again.\" You find yourself overboard with that. [Deuteronomy 24:1-4], [Malachi 2:14-16], [Matthew 5:30-32], [Mark 10:2-12], [Matthew 19:1-12]\n\nL-67 So, see, it's neither southeast or northeast; we want directly east. You'd run out of Scripture when you go this way, you run out of Scripture when you go that way. We want to know where Scripture meets Scripture, and know what's the Truth of it. Each takes a different way, and fail to bring up the correct answer, but there still must be an answer.\n\nL-68 It's just like, today, there is two great schools of doctrine in the church; one of them is Calvinism, the other one is Armin-... Arminianism. One of them is legalist, the other one is grace. And we come to find out that the people who believe in grace, the Calvinists, they say, \"Bless God, it don't hurt me to smoke. It don't hurt me to drink. I can do these things, I've got Eternal security.\" Then we find the other side, on the legalist, said, \"Oh, I would like to bawl him out, I would like to show him a piece of my mind, but, I'm a Christian, I have to keep still.\" See, you find yourself on two different roads, and neither one of them is right. Now, that's hard to say that, but it is the truth. 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min\n\nL-69 We find ourselves on two different roads; one going one way, one another. Now let's see what Truth is.\n\nL-70 Now listen, and see if this sounds sensible to you. For instance, if I get ready to go overseas. And I'll take my own family. I'll call my wife up to me, and I will say, \"We're go-... I'm going overseas, dear.\" Now here is the legalist's side, \"Now, my wife, I'm going to lay the law down to you! If you flirt with any man while I'm gone, when I come back you're a divorced woman. And I don't want you making eyes, don't want you flirting! You understand that? I'm your husband! If you do it, I'm going to put you away when I come back.\"\n\nL-71 Then she reaches and gets me by the tie, and say, \"My good man, I want to tell you something, see, see, that if you make eyes at any woman, or take any woman out, or flirt with any woman, you're going to be a divorced man when you come back.\" Now, wouldn't that be a happy home? That's legalists. All right.\n\nL-72 Now, the other side is, that if I go overseas and I make a mistake... Go over and say, \"Now, look, I'll take this woman out. Oh, it's all right with my wife, she don't care.\" My wife say, \"I'll go out with this man. It's all right with Bill, he don't care.\" If I don't care, then there is something wrong with me; I don't love that woman right. And if she don't care, there is something wrong with her. She is my wife; I don't want other man fooling with her. She is my wife.\n\nL-73 Now, the correct way of it, is, there is both of them has got a truth, but not the exact Truth.\n\nL-74 Now when I go overseas, to make it right, my little family gathers around, and we pray with one another. And I commit them to God, and they commit me to God. And when we do, we go over sea, I go overseas. Now, I know she loves me; I have confidence in her. And I love her; she's got confidence in me. As long as I love her like that, she don't have any worry about me taking any other woman out. As long as she loves me right, why, there is no need of me thinking about any other man going out with her, because she is my wife and I believe her.\n\nL-75 I believe, if I would actually do something wrong, make a mistake and go out with some woman, and return back and would confess it to her, and tell her, \"Meda, I didn't mean to do that. I just got caught in a trap; this woman just run right up to me and--and grabbed me by the arm, and started so-and-so,\" I believe she would be understanding. I believe she would forgive me for it. But I wouldn't do it, for nothing, because I love her. Though she would forgive me, I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't hurt her, for nothing. Though I know she would forgive me for it, I don't want to hurt her.\n\nL-76 And that's the way it is with God. If I... if a phileo love, which is human love, fellowship love, can make a man feel that about his wife; what about agapao love, the Greek word meaning \"the love of God,\" how would that make me do about Jesus Christ? I, as long as I want to go do it, it's in my heart to do it! Whether... I say, as long as it's in my heart to do it, I go do it. Legalism won't let me do it, is because that I knowed I'd get punished for doing it. But the real Truth of it is, is when the love of God comes into your heart till you want to do It. That's the Truth of it. There is the two schools. Not legalism or other, or the Calvinism, it's both. [I John 5:1-3]\n\nL-77 Now we find out today, also, there is many different denominations. There is the Catholic church, the Protestant church. Each one of them says they're the Way, see, \"We have the Way, we're the Truth.\" There is the Methodist, says, \"We have the Truth.\" The Baptist says, \"We have the Truth.\"\n\nL-78 Well, to me, as long as they feel that way, it's not so, because Jesus said, \"I am the Truth.\" See? [John 14:6]\n\nL-79 Therefore, as my sermon last night was, that He is the place where God put His Name, the only place to worship. You are not a Christian because you're a Protestant. You're not a Christian because you're Catholic. You're not a Christian because you're Methodist, Baptist, or Pentecostal. You are a Christian because you've been baptized into Jesus Christ, by the Holy Spirit, not by water. \"There is one Faith; one Lord; one baptism,\" that's Holy Spirit baptism. Water baptism inducts you into a fellowship. The Holy Spirit baptism inducts you into Christ. There is the Truth. [Ephesians 4:3-6]\n\nL-80 We have also two thoughts of this Marriage And Divorce. Now, that, our Lord has opened the Seven-Seal mystery of His Word to us, in this last days. Now, many of you, this might be Greek to you, but my church understands. By what? And you've heard of the visions and what taken place. And the question is a Bible question, we are invited here to believe there must be a true answer to the whole hidden secret that's been hid since the foundation of the world. And 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min the Bible prophesies and says that in this day these secrets would be made known. Revelations 10, \"And at the sounding of the seventh angel, the Laodicea messenger, the mysteries of God would be made known.\" And this is the last age, which is Laodicea. [Revelation 10:7]\n\nL-81 Look at all this revival has went on for fifteen years or more, and not one denomination come out of it. Luther had a revival, there went a denomination; Wesley, there went a denomination; Alexander Campbell, there went a denomination; all these other great... John Smith and so forth, denominations, Moody, all along. But here has been one... Usually a revival only lasts about three years. But this has been going for over fifteen years, and not one denomination has sprung up from it, for this is the Seed time. There is no more shuck; after the one shuck is gone, it's Seed.\n\nL-82 God is ready, if He isn't doing it now, He is going to call a Church to perfection by His Word, Jesus Christ. Notice, there must be an answer somewhere, and being That, the seven-sealed mystery of God, Seven Seals. [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-83 How many understands that, raise up your hand. Let's see. I think most of them is our congregation from around, listen. If not, the books will be out pretty soon, upon the subject. We have books, some books on It now.\n\nL-84 Jesus, in our text, invites us to go back to the beginning, for the true Scriptural answer.\n\nL-85 Now, when He was confronted with this, there was two things in view. The priests said to Him, \"Can a man put away his wife, marry another, for any cause?\" And Jesus said, \"It wasn't so from the beginning.\" Then they said, \"Moses suffered us a writing of divorcement, and to put her away for anything they wanted to.\" [Matthew 19:3], [Matthew 19:7-8]\n\nL-86 He said, \"That, Moses did that because,\" I'm letting that string awhile, \"because of the hardness of your hearts; but from, or at the beginning it wasn't so.\" The question! [Matthew 19:8]\n\nL-87 The question today, like of world peace, \"Is it coming by politics, union of nations, united?\" I say to you, nay. It's always failed, and it will again. But there remains a true answer to the question, \"Will there be peace upon the earth?\" Yes, when sin is ridden off of the earth, there will be peace. But until that time, there will be no peace; \"nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.\" God gave a remedy for sin. Listen close now. God gave the remedy to rid sin off the earth, but man of the earth won't accept God's remedy. [Matthew 24:7]\n\nL-88 God gave us a remedy and a way to marry our wives and live with them, but man won't accept God's remedy, won't accept His Word on it. Jesus has said this. And this reminds us of--of His Words, knowing that He said, \"Heavens and earth will fail, pass away, but Mine won't.\" [Matthew 24:35]\n\nL-89 The question, the true answer that Jesus want us to go back to, is to go back to the beginning. Then, that would be in Genesis, 'cause the word Genesis is the seed chapter to every question in the Bible. And you always have to go back to the seed to see what kind of a seed is in the field, to find out what your crops will be. Now, what kind of seed is sown? Genesis, being the seed chapter, we'd go back to Genesis. Jesus introduces us to that Scripture, \"at the beginning.\" Now, remember, that's when time started to begin. Before that, it was Eternity. Now, our question there was, notice, if we go back to the beginning.\n\nL-90 Now don't fail this! And that's the reason I want to talk slow, so that the people out on the wires, and that the tape will say it clearly.\n\nL-91 If Jesus said, \"Go back to the beginning,\" there was only one pair of anything on earth. There was one Adam, one Eve, they were joined by God alone. One female horse, one male; one female parrot, one male. \"At the beginning,\" as He told us to go back, there was only one pair of anything. Is that true? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Then, we find now that everything \"in the beginning\" was running in perfect order and harmony with God, nothing was out of cater. [Genesis 3:1-21]\n\nL-92 Everything in heaven is still in order; all the stars, the galaxies, the solar system, everything is perfectly in order. One of them move, it would interrupt the whole program. 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min\n\nL-93 Now listen. Do you see? One interruption spoils the entire program! Now, when human beings was running in continuity with God, with one man and one woman, this woman sinned and it throwed the whole earthly program out of continuity with God. Therefore, one word added to this Book, or one Word taken from It; throws a Christian out of continuity with God, throws a church out of continuity with God, throws a family out of continuity with God. Every believer can be throwed out, by not accepting every Word of God. [Galatians 5:9-10]\n\nL-94 Then, it was the woman that caused the separation of the lovely home. It was not a Cherubim that bothered the earth. It was not Adam that throwed the home out. It was not anything else that throwed the home out, and throwed the whole thing out of continuity, but a woman, Eve. And it is here that \"the beginning,\" that Jesus spoke of, was broken. Jesus said, \"At the beginning, God made one male, one female, of each kind.\" And now when this woman... not the female horse, not the female dog; but the woman, she broke the entire continuity of God's operation on the earth, and throwed everything into death. The woman, not the man, she broke the covenant. She broke the covenant, because (why?) she stepped across the borders of God's Word. Now, if she broke her covenant with her husband, she broke her covenant with God; then, because she broke the covenant with God, she broke it with her husband. [Matthew 19:4], [Genesis 3:1-21]\n\nL-95 And when you break your promise and your covenant to God's Word, that's what caused so many illegitimate church members, 'cause a group of man got together and said, \"Well, It didn't mean that,\" and it throws the whole organization out of continuity with the Word. \"We don't believe That. Doctor Jones said It wasn't so.\" But as long as God said It's so, He said, \"let every man's word be a lie, and Mine be the Truth!\" There it breaks the continuity.\n\nL-96 Now we see, being that the continuity is broken, then the Life line was broken, also the time line was broken, the covenant was broken, everything shattered! What caused it? A woman. That's what broke the covenant. Now, if you want to read that, you can read it, Genesis 3. [Genesis 3:1-15]\n\nL-97 Now, it was then man was made to rule over the woman, by God's Word. She was no more co-equal with him. She was co-equal in nature, you know; but, when she broke God's Word, God made a man to be a ruler over her. Genesis 3:16, if you want to put it down. She was no more equal with the man. She was the breaker of God's Word. [Genesis 3:16]\n\nL-98 Don't you see, \"she,\" she, the church down here? The breaker of God's Word, that throwed her completely out of continuity. And that's what the church has done, and throwed spiritual death upon the whole thing. Now you'll understand why I hammer at these things like I do. It's Truth! This is Bible facts.\n\nL-99 Notice, why did she do such a thing as this; how could that lovely, beautiful, perfect woman?\n\nL-100 I seen a picture one time, I believe it was in Greece, of an artist that painted a picture of Eve. She was the most horrible-looking thing you ever seen. That shows what a carnal mind can look at. But, she wasn't; she was beautiful, 'cause she was perfect woman, all woman.\n\nL-101 Notice, why did she do such a thing, being in that high order? She was right with man, co-equal with him. But we all know now that she lost her co-equalness with man, when she sinned, and God said, \"Man will be your ruler from here out.\" Now, that's the Scripture. If you want to, we could read it. [Genesis 3:16]\n\nL-102 I'm giving you the Scriptures, so save time for this big hookup across the country, that you might read it yourself.\n\nL-103 Notice the reason she did that. How did Satan ever get to her?\n\nL-104 Did you know Satan was co-equal with God one day? Sure was, all but a creator; he was everything, stood at the right hand of God, in the Heavens, the great leading Cherubim.\n\nL-105 Notice the reason that she did this, she was not in the original creation. She is not in God's original creation; she is a by-product. Therefore, \"at the beginning,\" as Jesus referred to it, she was not original creative being of God. She is a by-product of a man, when Jesus referred to \"the beginning.\"\n\nL-106 Remember, Adam was both masculine and feminish, in the original creation, one, but then he was separated by a rib. 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min\n\nL-107 Notice, but a by-product, and, notice, the only one of all God's creation, of every animal and anything else, she was the only one designed this way. Every other female was in the original creation. Every other female was in the original creation, but Eve was not in the original creation. See, that had to be made that way. We'll get to it after a while. Notice, in this creation that she was in, not in the original, but a by-product. And in this creation, there is...\n\nL-108 Now I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I want to tell you the Truth. And you just sit still; you're doing nice.\n\nL-109 There is nothing designed to be so deceitful, as a woman that's deceitful. There cannot be nothing else; there is nothing made to be that way.\n\nL-110 Also, there is nothing that can be so easily deceived as a woman. Now, the fall proves this statement to be true, the fall in the beginning.\n\nL-111 She was not in the original beginning creation. She was in Adam, but not in a female sex, herself, at the beginning. She was the by-product made.\n\nL-112 Now, there is nothing designed that can deceive, and be deceived, as easy as a woman. There is nothing designed or can stoop as low as a woman can. Think now. There is nothing designed, in all creation, that can stoop as low as a woman can. She can tear a man's heart to pieces easier than anything else there is in the world, is his wife. Let that nice little wife get to running around with some other man; look at that fellow sitting there with his children, the tears dropping out of his eyes. She is designed that way. She is designed to do this. There is no hog, no dog, or no other animal, designed like her or can stoop as low as she can stoop. Now, that is true. With regards to my sisters, I just want you to watch.\n\nL-113 No animal can be immoral. You call the dog a \"slut,\" the female dog, you call the male... hog a \"sow,\" but her morals is a million miles beyond many Hollywood star. That's how low she is designed to stoop. She can't... Just think of this now. There is nothing in the world, made in God's creation, that can be immoral, stoop that low.\n\nL-114 You say, \"Wait a minute, 'man'!\" We're going to get to that. The woman has to say \"yes.\"\n\nL-115 Notice, there is nothing designed to stoop so low, or be filthy, but a woman. A dog can't do it, a hog can't do it, a bird can't do it. No animal is immoral, nor it can be, for it is not designed so it can be. A female hog can't be immoral, a female dog can't be immoral, a female bird can't be immoral. A woman is the only thing can do it.\n\nL-116 Now you see where Satan went? See? But still she has, she is the one that's got the power to say \"yes\" or \"no.\" See, depends on where she wants to hold herself. See? Now here we can see plainly the serpent's seed, where it come in. There is only one place he could go to. If that wouldn't nail it down, somebody is blind. See? See, it had to go to that.\n\nL-117 Notice, the reason that animals couldn't do it, a female animal, they were in the original creation. But the woman was not in that original creation. Now we're going back to dig this up, then bring you right down to the modern day, in the Testament.\n\nL-118 She is designed, alone, for filth and unclean living. A dog can't, and no other female can. It's just the woman that can. A dog or any other animals, once a year, and that for her babies; not for sexual pleasure, but for her babies. The old sow hog, the old slut dog, once a year, one moment, that's for her babies. But a woman is designed for any time she desires. I've got some stuff crossed out here now; you can imagine the rest. A dog can't; woman can. I hope that the Holy Spirit reveals to you the rest of this I crossed out here.\n\nL-119 She is the only specie, specie of female, that is made prettier than the male. There is not another specie among anything. All other creatures of God is beautiful males, such as in animals, birds, and so forth, always the male is pretty.\n\nL-120 Look at the big buck deer, big fine horns, great specie; and the little, humble doe. Look at the big rooster with all of his pretty feathers; and the little, brown hen. Look at the birds, the cock and the hen. Why, why was it such, of all the creatures of God? Every creature, in the male is the prettiest. Between the sheep, between the--the hogs, between the horses, between anything else, it's always the big male that's pretty, and in the birds.\n\nL-121 But in the human race, it's the woman that's pretty, not the man; if he is, there is something wrong, there is 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min crossed-up seed somewhere. Originally it's that way. Why, why was it done? To deceive by. Her designer, Satan, is still working on her, too, in these last days.\n\nL-122 Let me stop here just for a moment. \"Pretty!\" Did you know, at the first destruction, internationally, of the world, or worldwide, was because of pretty women? \"When the sons of God saw the daughters of man were fair, they taken unto them women.\" Is that right?\n\nL-123 Have you noticed the increase of beauty of women in this day? I have seen the picture of Pearl O'Brien, which was supposed to be the prettiest woman in the nation, at one time. There isn't a teen-age girl in this school but what would out-shadow her, when it comes to beauty.\n\nL-124 The increase of the beauty of women is showing the time of deception. When did the church look any more prettier than it does today? Everything is featuring great, big fine buildings, and millions of this and millions of that. Don't you see, \"she,\" the deception!\n\nL-125 Now, there is nothing can stoop like her, and she is designed so that she can be deceiving. And Satan is really working on her today, in these last days, because he is her designer. I can prove that now. To go right back at the beginning, who started to work on her, Adam or Satan, God or Satan? See, that's her designer. It's her chief weapon to throw man to her filth, being a pretty woman, she can sway a man any way she wants to. Brother, it ain't the bootleg joint down here that gets the man; it's the pretty woman walking down the street, twisting herself, half dressed. That's what takes... That's the deceiver right there. And she is deadly with it, absolutely deadly. You may question me about Satan being her designer, but that's the Truth. Satan designed her. He still does it.\n\nL-126 Let me show you something in the Scripture. I got to take you back to Scripture, and you draw your opinion as you look at it today.\n\nL-127 Satan is the one who features that kind of beauty. If we'll notice, he was the most beautiful of all the Angels in Heaven. Is that right? And he desired to make Heaven a more beautiful place than the kingdom of Michael. Is that right? Also, to show that Cain was his son, he offered a more beautiful worship, decorated his altars with fruits and flowers, and so forth. Is that right? Beautiful! Sin is beautiful, what we call beauty today. And sin is deceiving, by beauty. You'd never look at a woman going down the street and tell what's in her heart. See? But I wanted to say these things so that you could see why that Satan is her designer. That's exactly right, his own son proved it, Cain. Now, she is beautiful so she can deceive.\n\nL-128 The world is beautiful so it can deceive. I mean kosmos, the order of the world. It's beautiful so it can deceive, great fine places and luxury.\n\nL-129 Remember the prophet, Amos, when he come up over and looked down into the city, and seen it like a modern Hollywood, his little old eyes got little, under that gray hair hanging in his face. He walked down there with a Message, and burst It out on that place. He said, \"The very God that you claim to serve, will destroy you!\" That's right.\n\nL-130 Sin is pretty. They picture Judas as some old drunken sot out here on the street somewhere, and mouth hanging with flies in it, and so forth, as Judas. Judas was handsome, strong, a deceiver. It ain't that guy to watch around you, it ain't a guy that (the old farmer) come in with a pair of overalls on, to watch around your wife; it's that slicker, he's the rascal.\n\nL-131 Sin is beautiful to the eyes of the world, but God is not featured in that kind of beauty. Did you know that? God is featured in character, beautiful character.\n\nL-132 In the Bible, Isaiah 53, if you want to put the Scripture down. It's got rows of Scripture wrote on the side here for it. Isaiah 53, the Bible said of our Lord Jesus, that, \"There was no beauty that we should desire Him. And we hid as it was our faces from Him.\" Is that right? We didn't desire Him, because He wasn't pretty. He was probably a little fellow, stoop-shouldered, ruddy-looking, and He wasn't desirable to be a leader. He didn't look like a leader. Talked with common street-talk, and so forth, like the people does, the common people, so therefore He didn't look like He was any great scholar, educated, fine, all robed up, and everything. He was just an ordinary man. \"There was no beauty of Him, that we should desire Him.\" He walked in and out of man, right along, they didn't even know Who He was. He didn't 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min look like a god walking along, what we would think was a god. But, the same, He was! [Isaiah 53:2]\n\nL-133 Did you notice when the Lord God said to--to Samuel, \"Go up to the house of Jesse and anoint one of his sons, king, to take Saul's place\"?\n\nL-134 Now, the people chose Saul, when Samuel absolutely told them not to do it. He said, \"God don't want you to have a king; He is your King.\" And said, \"Have I ever said anything to you, in the Name of the Lord, but what come to pass? Have I ever begged you for money or something, another, for my living?\" [I Samuel 8:5]\n\nL-135 They said, \"No, you never begged us for money. And whatever you said, in the Name of the Lord, it come to pass. But we want the king, anyhow,\" so they chose Saul. Look what the world chose! Look what Israel chose! Israel, God's anointed, they chose a man that was head and shoulders above any man in the nation; great, big, fine, handsome-looking fellow, and he always was a fly in the ointment.\n\nL-136 But God said, \"I'm going to choose you a king to My choosing.\" So He said, \"Samuel, I ain't going to tell you who he is, but you go up there. He is one of Jesse's sons.\" [I Samuel 16:1]\n\nL-137 And Jesse, his wife, and all of them looked around, said, \"Yes, our oldest son, he's a great, tall, handsome man, he'll look just right for the king's crown. He is smart. He is educated. He is a fine man. I know he'll be just right. He speaks his word proper.\" [I Samuel 16:6-7]\n\nL-138 When they brought him out, Samuel took the cruse of oil and went towards him. He said, \"No, the Lord refused him.\" So he went all the way down, to six sons, and the Lord refused every one of them. He said, \"Isn't there another one?\"\n\nL-139 \"Oh,\" he said, \"yes, there is one, he is back out there herding the sheep. He just sets back there and plays songs, and sings it, and shouts, and goes on. But, he's a little old stoop-shouldered, ruddy-looking guy, he would never make a king.\"\n\nL-140 He said, \"Go get him.\" And while David come in the sight of the prophet, the prophet run with the oil and poured it upon his head, said, \"This is God's chosen.\" Not pretty; but character. God looks at character. [I Samuel 16:12]\n\nL-141 Man looks at natural beauty. It's deceiving. And that's why a woman was given that beauty, for deception, to deceive. A beautiful woman, if she don't use it in the right way, it's a curse to her; that will send her to hell quicker than any thing else I know of. If she just... If she can be pretty, sure, as long as she stays with her husband and does what's right, and that--that's fine and dandy. But she can take that same thing and, my, how she can deceive with it, for it was give to her to do so.\n\nL-142 Notice, now, but God is featured in character. \"There was no beauty we should desire Jesus,\" but there never was a character like Him, on the earth. [Isaiah 53:2]\n\nL-143 Now we find out, today, that the--the church character, Satan and his group, look after big, beautiful churches, beautiful things. That's what the world looks at today. \"Oh, it's the pastor, the great so-and-so time, so-and-so, so priestly and godly, walk out with his big robes, and things like that.\" They call that beauty.\n\nL-144 But the real saints of God looks for the character of the vindicated Word.\n\nL-145 That's what the saints did in that day, when they seen Jesus. He wasn't nothing to look at, but they seen God was in Him. They seen God was with Him.\n\nL-146 That's how that those, Joab and those characters with David, a little old fellow, but they seen the--the man was in him. They seen that God was in him, and they knowed he was coming into power someday. They... One slew them other five brothers of Goliath, single-handed. One killed three hundred man; when some women was picking some beans for dinner, and the army had gone away, and he took a spear and killed three hundred man, Philistines. Character! Why? They stayed right by David. They knowed the anointing was upon him, and they knowed he was coming into power.\n\nL-147 A pure picture of the Church today that will stand by the Word! We know It's going to be made vindicated. We know It's coming into power someday. Although Saul... And he was a fugitive from the rest of the nations, but they 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min knowed he was coming into power. We know He is coming into power, too, so we take that Word and stand right there, no matter what it costs. If we have to cut Philistines, or jump in a pit and kill a lion, as one did, we go anyhow, 'cause it's the... that's the way God designed it to be. We look for character.\n\nL-148 You may now ask me, \"Why did He permit her to be designed thus?\" I don't want to take too much time, 'cause I got a lot more to say here. \"Why,\" the question might arise then, \"why did God make this woman like this? Why did He permit her to be like that?\" It was for His Own good pleasure. Sure.\n\nL-149 Now if you want to turn in your Bible just a minute, let's turn to Romans 9, just a minute, and show you something, how God does these things, if you want to--to read it. And we can see here what God does for His Own good pleasure. Romans 9:14. Then what shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness before God?... [Romans 9:14]\n\nL-150 When He chose Esau, or chose Jacob and rejected Esau, before either boy could have a right to make a choice, himself, neither one of them; before they was born, still in the womb of the mother, God said, \"I hate Esau, and I love Jacob.\" See? Why? For he said unto Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not... him that willeth, nor... him that runneth, but it's God that sheweth mercy. For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. Therefore he... (now watch here)... for he... mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. Thou will say... unto me, Why then does he... find fault? For who has resisted his will? Nay but, O man, who art thou that rilest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me this? Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel to honour, and the other to dishonour? What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured... such long-suffering the vessel of wrath fitted to destruction: ... that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessel of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, [Romans 9:14-23]\n\nL-151 Now argue with That a while. God did it! He had to make it this a way. It had to be there. Now listen now for about five minutes, I want to call your attention to something.\n\nL-152 What is God? God is a great Eternal. At the beginning, way back before there was a beginning, He wasn't even God. Did you know that? God is an \"object of worship,\" and there wasn't nothing to worship Him. He lived alone.\n\nL-153 And in Him was attributes. What is an attribute? A thought. Now you'll get something that will border on the lesson for tonight. Notice, He was His attributes that was in Him. Now, it was in Him to be Father, it was in Him to be God, it was in Him to be Son, it was in Him to be Saviour, it was in Him to be Healer. And all these things here are just displaying His attributes. There is nothing out of order. You think God didn't see the end from the beginning? Certainly, He did. There's nothing out of order, it's just displaying His attributes.\n\nL-154 Now, He could not be just and make a man to fall. He had to put him on equal basis, of free moral agency, to make his own choice, but knowing he would fall.\n\nL-155 Now, He can't be a Saviour unless something is lost. He can't be a Healer unless something is sick. These things had to be that way. God made them thus so that His great attributes could be displayed. If there wasn't that, He'd have never been a Saviour. But we know He was, even before there was a time, He was a Saviour. He was a Saviour, so there has to be something lost. How is it going to be?\n\nL-156 If He takes and loses it, just in order to save it, then it isn't justice to His judgment. He couldn't send a man to hell, and be just. He is kind, gentle, true, honest, and He is a great Judge. See, He would be working against Himself. 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min\n\nL-157 So He had to put a man out here, and make him on free moral agency, so he would, knowing, would fall; and the man, in His Own image, how could he fall? Now you seeing day Light? So, He had to make a by-product, something out of the original creation. Now you see it. See? There you come. See? Then, that's what fell. He made it, knowing it would fall. And it's put over in the hands of Satan, for a vessel of dishonor. Where is honor bestowed today? You think on that. Notice closely now.\n\nL-158 Then again, why she was designed this way and not like other females, why was the woman designed so and not other females? None of the other females was designed like that. They're not, today. They can't. Not being made that way, she can't do it. Why did He not make this female then, a woman, just like other females, so she would just be the same way, could just raise her babies? Then she would have her husband, and live; and when it come time for her baby, she would have her baby. Why, why didn't He make her like this?\n\nL-159 I can't say these words. And you understand what I'm talking about, don't you? If you can understand, say \"amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Yeah. See? There is young girls setting here, and young boys, see. But you know, the animal has to come to a certain time of the year, and her mate, then that's all. But, a woman, it's any time. And why did He make her like this?\n\nL-160 Now watch His great program unfold, as we go on through here now, just as perfect as perfect can be. I didn't know this till the other day.\n\nL-161 Why didn't He make her like that in the beginning, like the rest of His females? Because it would be unbecoming to Him. He is the Fountain of all purity. That's the reason He had to let Satan get a hold of her, what he done in the perversion. Such a creature would be, would not be becoming to Him, originally designed for.\n\nL-162 All His works that He designed, in the original, is in continuity. All of His original works was in continuity. The female dog, the male dog; see, female cow, the male cow; everything in continuity. All nature is in continuity. Seed die, go in the ground; just like death, burial, resurrection. The sap goes down out of a tree, drops its leaf, comes back the next year with the resurrection of a new leaf. See what I mean? Everything, even nature, of God, is all in a continuity, in one; and here is one designed out of the continuity of God. Nature is so designed so it can't sin. Think! The original creation, of God, could not sin.\n\nL-163 Oh, don't you see it now, in this view here, the perversion of the church? The original is God's Word! There is no sin in God. See what I mean? Here is a creature that come into existence by a perversion. God is going to have a Church, but look at this perverted thing they got out here.\n\nL-164 God has male and female. But, this woman, see, the very symptoms of it shows back what was in God's mind. We could take an hour, or two, and break that down. She, made this creature for that way, He made the creature and turned her so Satan could get a hold of her, and he did. He has still got her. She had better flee to the Cross, like man, too.\n\nL-165 Notice, all nature runs in continuity. If He'd have made the woman in the same original creation, there'd have been no sin, because she couldn't have done it, she couldn't have done it. She is a perversion of the original creation.\n\nL-166 So is all sin a perversion of the original Truth! What is a lie? Is the Truth perverted. What is an adultery? Is the right act perverted. So there is the perverted creature, there is the perverted whole thing. And the whole thing is spelled s-i-n, laying right there. That's why the question is so great.\n\nL-167 Only a piece, scrap, made of a man, to deceive him by; God made it, right here has proved it. That's what she was made for.\n\nL-168 An immoral woman is the lowest thing that can be thought of, in the earth. Excuse this, young ladies. She is nothing but a human garbage can, a sex exposal. That's all she is, an immoral woman, is a human sexual garbage can, a pollution, where filthy, dirty, ornery, low-down filth is disposed by her. What is she made this way for? For deception. Every sin that ever was on the earth was caused by a woman.\n\nL-169 And an analyst just from Chicago, a--a woman wrote this article, the police force; that they chased down, in 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min United States, metropolitan United States, that \"Ninety-eight percent of every crime that was ever did in any form, in the United States, there was either a woman in it or behind it.\"\n\nL-170 Now I'm saying all this, to get to one thing here at the end, so that you can see what's the matter.\n\nL-171 She was made to deceive, like she did Adam at the beginning, tell him that the fruit was pleasant, and so forth, to deceive him and take him away from the Word. That's the way the church does today, same thing. But then, after that, he become her ruler, to rule over her.\n\nL-172 Now what a difference in this day, in this day of conception. Instead of him being her ruler, she has become his god. Sure, she rules him. Now you can probably well understand what I've been hitting at. By her beauty and her sex control, her shape that was given to her by Satan, the by-product that Satan did, she is sent to deceive sons of God. And she can sway more of them to hell than any other instrument Satan has got. That's exactly right.\n\nL-173 I'm talking of the immoral now, not you sisters. We'll give you your place, right place, in a few minutes, in the Word of God here. It was in God's plan from begin--beginning.\n\nL-174 Now to do this today, what is the god of the United States? You remember in the tabernacle years ago, I preached on that? The god of this modern day, a little flapper sitting there with make-up on, and dress pulled up over her knees, and things like that. I said, \"Behold your god!\" And that's right, she is on every advertisement, half naked. She is on the street, the same way.\n\nL-175 It's an instrument of Satan, \"from the beginning,\" Jesus says. See? We see that it's so now, and \"from the beginning,\" and what He's talking about.\n\nL-176 Now, the heathens used to make her a god, (did you know that?) a goddess. Sure did. They make her a goddess, for they did have sex acts in their worship. They claimed that, \"She was the creator. In her womb she carried the seed and created.\" That's a lie. There is only one Creator, that's God. But you remember Paul there? \"Diana, of Ephesus,\" a image of a rock, said, \"the goddess of Heaven, throwed down.\" Don't you see how heathen worship is?\n\nL-177 And we, not knowing it, turns right straight back to heathen worship again, to women, the very lowest creature on the earth, woman-worship! She will sway man any way she wants to. And not knowing, all that beauty on the outside, that hell is on the inside. Solomon said, \"Her, her gates is the gates to hell.\"\n\nL-178 Now we see plainly here what Jesus spoke of in Revelation, the 2nd chapter and the 15th verse, of the Nicolaitane doctrine, the oncoming of that church pulling itself away from the Word.\n\nL-179 Also we can see here, plainly, these vulgar, ungodly, filthy programs that we have on television, of Hollywood sex queens. We can see the filth of this city, as these kids, little old girls walking up-and-down the street here, with little bitty, tight clothes, twisting around, and it cold enough to freeze them to death. They don't know that that's the Devil doing that. They are possessed of an evil spirit, and don't know it! You don't see a female dog doing that, do you? You don't see any other female doing that, and no male better walk up to her, either.\n\nL-180 See, now you get the picture? We'll introduce something just in a moment, the Lord willing. Now you see the Nicolaitanes, you see their doctrine.\n\nL-181 You see the teen-age queens, they call them, these stripteases out on the street. Used to have to go to some vulgar show on the side, to see a striptease. Just open your eyes, look out on the street, that's all you have to do now. The whole thing is a striptease. Sure. What do they do it for? To tantalize, tempt, that's the only thing she can do it for. She does it because she is filthy. She does it because she is made that way. She don't realize that she is an instrument in the hands of Satan, and that's what she is.\n\nL-182 Even in our schools today, they're teaching sex acts. Our rotten world of woman-worship! I know they don't want to believe that. Stand and sing some kind of hymn, and so forth, on one day; and out with women, running around, all night long. See? All right. When, in God's sight, the Word, she is the lowest of all animals that God put on the earth. Watch.\n\nL-183 That's why God forbids her to teach His Word. That's right. First Timothy 2:9-15, \"I suffer not a woman to teach, 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min or to have any authority.\" See? And also First Corinthians 14:34, \"Let your women keep silent in the churches, for it's not permitted to them to speak, for they are commanded to be in silent; also saith the Law.\" But, today, what does the church do? They make her pastors, evangelists, when the Bible completely forbids it. And the Bible said, \"as also saith the Law,\" making it run in continuity, the whole thing. [I Timothy 2:9-15], [I Corinthians 14:34]\n\nL-184 Just like the Lamb was, last night, the only place of worship, under the shed Blood of the Lamb. It's the only place today, in Christ. Only way you do is come into Him. That's the only place to worship. It always was that way. The only place to worship is under the shed Blood.\n\nL-185 So now we see the whole picture of it unfolding to us. There she is. That's why God won't let her teach, won't let her do anything in the church but to sit still with a veiled face.\n\nL-186 Now can you see why I have said the things and done the things that I have done, knowing all this in my heart, brother, sisters? I know, sisters, I'm... you got your place (just in a moment), and the wonderful character that God can mold in you. But I'm just trying to speak on the other side, to show what you're actually from, \"in the beginning.\" Jesus told us to \"go back to the beginning,\" to find it. That's what we're doing.\n\nL-187 Now I've had to hit the high points on a lot of this, and I hope you understand it. And you people who will be listening to this tape, I hope you understand. Just go back. It's only to show that Jesus said, \"Go back, from the beginning, and find out.\" All things, go back to the beginning. You can see, today. [John 1:2]\n\nL-188 Why, people, they say I'm a woman-hater. That's far from the Truth. I do not. They call, \"A woman-hater!\" Remember, they called Paul a woman-hater. A woman minister, not long ago, said, \"Oh, you're like old Paul, all he had to do is pick on us women.\"\n\nL-189 A saint of God, that was permitted to write the Bible, the New Testament, and dispute his Words? He said, \"If an Angel from Heaven teaches any other thing than This that I have said, let him be accursed,\" let alone some woman preacher. [Galatians 1:8-9]\n\nL-190 They said Elijah was a woman-hater. He wasn't a woman-hater, of real women. He just didn't like them Jezebels.\n\nL-191 And if that be so, then must be God must be the same way, because He is the Word which come to the prophets. So it must be God, the same way, so, see, He knows the original creation, \"from the beginning,\" He said, \"from the beginning.\" They were prophets who the Word came to. [John 1:1]\n\nL-192 And He made her for man, and not man for her. Did you know that, that, \"Woman was made for man, and not man for woman\"? How many knows that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] The Bible teaches that. All right. She was given a place in man, before the fall, equal over all creation. But \"after\" the fall, now here we bring the subject up. But \"after\" the fall, he was her ruler, she must keep silent in all matters, now after the original beginning is over. [Matthew 19:8]\n\nL-193 Jesus said, \"It wasn't so from the beginning.\" That's when time began, when God made it first in His original creation. All that understand, say \"amen\" again. [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] In the beginning God created just one male and one female. But then the woman was made different from the animals, all other animals, for deception. Now watch now, \"It wasn't so from the beginning.\" She was made, if she had stayed in original condition, she would have never been no fall. But she caused the fall and the interruption that broke the whole continuity of God, and throwed death, sorrow, and everything else, on the earth. She was made thus.\n\nL-194 Now notice now \"after\" the beginning, after the beginning, after time began; back in that was Eternity, is over. Notice, after that fall was made by Eve, after the fall, there was need to be another covenant made. Now this is going to stumble you, but I'm going to give you the Scripture to prove that this is the Truth. Now notice after the fall, Jesus said... God, at the beginning, made one of a kind; but now, after the fall, now we're going beyond that. The covenant was co-equal; but now, after the fall, there is another covenant made. Now she was no longer ruler with him, each must have a separate covenant.\n\nL-195 Now let's see if that's right. Let's take Genesis 3, and find out if this is right, now as we go along, 'cause we want 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min to be positive of these things, they are taught out and brought out exactly true. So that maybe right here we have a little time, 'cause we're not too far from the end now, to get to the closing part of the subject, to show why and what about divorces, and so forth. Now in Genesis the 3rd chapter, and we will begin now with the 3rd, and the 16th verse. Let's begin at the 14th verse. And the LORD... said unto the serpent, (now He is going to curse it), Because thou hast--thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all the cattle,... above every beast of the field; and upon thy belly thou shall go, and dust shall thou eat all the days of thy life: And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and the woman's seed; and it shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel. (The promising, \"coming through the woman,\" the Messiah, to redeem.) Unto the woman he said,... [Genesis 3:14]\n\nL-196 Now look, now there is the covenant with the serpent. Which, they were all alright beforehand, at the beginning, or before the beginning. Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrows and thy conception; and in sorrow shall thou bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee, not no more co-equal together at all.\n\nL-197 Now she has turned right around, and she is the ruler. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat... it: cursed be the ground (not cursed Adam, now) cursed be the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shall thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns... and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herbs of the field; And in sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread, till thou returns to the ground; for out of it, out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. [Genesis 3:14-19]\n\nL-198 Two covenants. Now that closes \"the beginning,\" of what Jesus said, \"It wasn't so at the beginning.\" We got another covenant now. Notice, it's another covenant. Now there is a covenant for the product, and the by-product. Notice, the fall brought trouble, death, to every creature of the creation, making a difference in all nature. Now let us notice what Jesus said about, \"from the beginning it wasn't so.\" Now it is not so \"from,\" it is now it is \"after\" the beginning. Now there is a double covenant. [Matthew 19:8]\n\nL-199 First was just a covenant, Adam and Eve was co-equal, one man and one woman. Now the woman sinned, and (what does she do?) that throwed them all to death, and God had to make a covenant by that, another covenant. Here it is right here in Genesis 3:16, He made another covenant.\n\nL-200 Now the world is to be repopulated, not by the original creation of God, like in the beginning, not by the original creation, but by sex desire. Now that takes care of \"the beginning,\" doesn't it? In the beginning there was only one man and one woman, one male and one female; but when she crossed that line and brought this sin, now the world is to be repopulated again, by sex, not by creation; by sex. See where the woman is at now, now? But that's the way the world is populated today, through women.\n\nL-201 That's the reason Jesus had to come through the woman, to bring it back to its original beginning again, without sex desire. He is virgin born. But, hallelujah, there will come a time where it won't be no more sex, but God shall call His children from the dust of the earth, back like they was in the original, not through any woman; but through the molding of the clay and the cosmic lights, and the petroleum, He will create again like He did Adam at the first time. Jesus made this possible, by God making Himself a Man and come into the world so He could die, through this woman. Now is testing time, by sin.\n\nL-202 Now you see then, \"after\" the beginning, it was something else was introduced. Now this is going to shock you. Are you tired? [Congregation says, \"No.\"--Ed.] Just sit still just a little longer.\n\nL-203 Then when the double covenant was made by man and woman, through sex, another covenant altogether (not the original covenant, but another covenant), now what's introduced? Polygamy, in all. Then, after the beginning, polygamy was introduced both in man and in beasts; after the beginning, the fall. God now, secondarily, sets a new 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min nature again, by sex. God created the first without sex. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now it's another covenant with nature, He sets it in another order, by sex. Second covenant: one male, many females; one buck deer, a whole harem of does. Is that right? One bull, a whole herd of cattle, cows; one rooster, a yardful of hens. Is that right? One David, after His Own heart, with five hundred wives; with a hundred children born to him, in one year, of different women, a man after God's Own heart. One Solomon, with a thousand wives. But notice now, it wasn't so at the beginning, but now it's \"after\" the beginning. The woman has done this, then she just becomes what she is now. See?\n\nL-204 David, the king which represented Christ! Hold that in your mind. David represented Christ. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Christ is setting, going to sit on his throne. And this David, a man after God's Own heart, had five hundred wives. See what I mean? David with his five hundred wives, Solomon with his thousand. And Solomon is the son of David, in the natural; which represents Jesus Christ, the Son of David, in the spiritual. But that's natural, sex life. This is going to be spiritual, created. Why? Created. See, that's the way it was at the beginning, but not now in this life we live in now.\n\nL-205 Notice, don't fail this now, take it all down in your hearts. But not one of those women could even have one more husband. He is the original creation, not her. Not one of those women could have one more husband, but that one husband could have a thousand wives. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD. That's the Bible. Now I've went back, took my time and showed you back yonder where it started, what Jesus said. Now do you see it clearly? They could have as many...\n\nL-206 \"Oh,\" you say, \"that was just for Israel.\" Is it?\n\nL-207 When Abraham took Sarah down into the Philistine country, there was a king down there named Abimelech. And Sarah was a hundred years old, right at it, but she had been changed back to a young woman and been made beautiful. Do you know that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] All right. And Abimelech wanted her for a wife. You remember my Message on it? Abimelech wanted to take Sarah for a wife. Probably had a harem, but he could not take her if she was married to Abraham. So Abraham said to Sarah, \"Say that you are, 'my brother,' because he'll kill me so that he can have you.\" Why didn't he just chase Abraham out of the country, and take his wife and go on? Not only a law was it with believers, but to all people in the creation. Sinner or a saint, you are responsible, man, for these acts. There was a heathen king. How many knows that story is true? [\"Amen.\"] It's the Bible, Genesis, about the 16th chapter, I think. [Genesis 20:1-7]\n\nL-208 You notice, Abimelech would have took her for a wife. He fixed hisself to have this new Hebrew girl. And he said, \"This is my...\" She said, \"That's my brother.\" He said, \"That's my sister.\" [Genesis 20:2]\n\nL-209 And Abimelech said, \"I'll just take her for a wife then.\" Could you imagine a man doing a thing like that? But he did it. [Genesis 20:2]\n\nL-210 And then that night, while he went to sleep, the Lord appeared to him in a dream, and said, \"Abimelech, you're as good as a dead man.\" He was protecting that, that stream of Jewish blood there, you see. He said, \"You're as good as a dead man. You've got another man's wife you're fixing to marry.\" [Genesis 20:5]\n\nL-211 He said, \"Lord, you knowed the integrity of my heart.\" Said, \"Did not she tell me that was her 'brother'? Did not he himself say, 'That's my sister'?\"\n\nL-212 He said, \"I know the integrity of your heart, that is the reason I wouldn't permit you to sin against Me.\" Is that right? Said, \"Restore his wife, because that man is My prophet. And unless you take him back his wife... And let him pray for you, not your priest. If he don't pray for you, your whole nation is gone.\" Amen. There is amazing grace. Right. \"Your whole nation is gone. That's that man's wife, and he is My prophet.\" Amen. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD. That's the Scripture. Right. [Genesis 20:6-7]\n\nL-213 Now we find out, death was caused. Death is cause of sin of the woman, come through the woman and not the man. By her way of living her life, and by her, all death comes. Her way of giving life is death. How many knows that? 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min Job 14, if you want to put down the Scripture.\n\nL-214 I got, if you question this, I got Scriptures wrote down for every bit of this.\n\nL-215 If you want to read Job 14 there, It says, \"Man that is born of woman is of a few days, and full of trouble.\" Is that right? \"He cometh up like the flower, he is cut down, and wastes away,\" and so forth. See? Every man that's born of a woman, is born in death as soon as he comes. [Job 14:1]\n\nL-216 But when he is born into the creation of God, he cannot die; he is from that other Tree that was in the garden of Eden, Christ. Eternal Life come by the Tree.\n\nL-217 \"Oh,\" you say, \"she was a tree?\" Sure. \"Well, they said, 'Thou shall not take of this tree.' God said, in Genesis back there, 'Thou shall not take of this tree.'\"\n\nL-218 Why, the woman is the tree. She is the fruit tree. You're the fruit of your mother. The fruit of the womb is you. That's right. And then the fruit of the Tree of Life, that was in the garden of Eden, is Christ. Through the woman come death; through the Man, in the original creation, come Life. To be born of a woman is death; to be born of Christ is Life. Get the idea? That's where. Now you see where the goddesses went to, don't you?\n\nL-219 First Adam and Eve typed the second Adam and Eve, see, the multiplication. Now the multiplication of Adam and Eve was through sex, to replenish the earth, but it wasn't so at the beginning. God just made a male and a female, like He did His other creatures, see, legal, just like the Church. [Genesis 2:16-17]\n\nL-220 Now let us, in view of these vindicated Truths of God, search a little further, if you want to. [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] All right. Now this may hurt just a little bit till we get down to the bottom of it, but I'm just going to show you the Truth of it.\n\nL-221 There is no minister that can marry a widow. Did you know that? You want to read that? All right, you get in the Leviticals, Leviticus 21:7 and Ezekiel 44:22, and It'll show you that the priesthood was not to marry a woman that's been touched by man. This type is of the virgin Bride of Jesus Christ, because they handled the Fire of God, the priests did, Aaron's sons. We haven't got time to read It all, and get out by noon, we got twenty minutes yet. And them is Aaron's sons that handled the--the--the Fire of God, so they could not marry a woman that had been touched by another man. The unchanging God said so. They could not marry another woman, and a woman been touched by a man, showing in type here, if you want to see it, that the Church of the living God is purely, unadulterated, the Word of God, and not a denomination that's been handled by man. [Ezekiel 44:22], [Leviticus 21:7]\n\nL-222 Note, let's read this here. I want to get this to you. Matthew 5, Jesus spoke here of something that's really of a vital importance. We want to see it, Matthew 5. I wrote on my...\n\nL-223 I marked out some of the things I was going to say just to the man, so had quite a little time saying it just before our sisters. But I want to--to go out here now before...\n\nL-224 Now, sister, I want to put you to the place where God's Word promised you, and you see then you stay in that place, too.\n\nL-225 Matthew 5:32. I want you to notice here, to support this same idea of \"one\" and \"many.\" Matthew, thirty-... I think it's Matthew 5:32, 31 to begin with. It has been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: [Matthew 5:31-32]\n\nL-226 That's Jesus speaking, the One said, \"from the beginning.\" Now watch. But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving... the cause of fornications, causes her to commit adultery; see, whosoever shall put away his wife, saving... the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery: (why? she'll marry again) and whosoever marrieth her that is divorced committed adultery.\n\nL-227 See, she has got a living husband, so no man can marry her. Care what she does and who she is, she's got a living husband, there is no grounds for her at all. But, it's not, for him. \"Causes her,\" not him. Get it? You have to make the Word run in continuity. See, nothing saying he couldn't, but she can't. See, \"causes her,\" not him. That's exactly what the Bible says, \"causes her.\" It is not stated against him to remarry, but \"her.\" Why? Christ in the type. [Matthew 5:32] 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min\n\nL-228 Notice, it is stated that he cannot remarry, only a virgin. He can remarry. He can, he can remarry again if it's a virgin, but he can't marry somebody else's wife. No indeedy. And if he does marry a divorced woman, he is living in adultery, I don't care who he is. The Bible said, \"Whosoever marrieth her that is put away, liveth in adultery.\" There you are, not no divorcees.\n\nL-229 See that original back there, \"from the beginning,\" now? Remarrying, now notice, he can, but she can't. Like David, like Solomon, like the continuity of the whole Bible, now, same as David and the rest of them.\n\nL-230 Now you notice in First Corinthians 7:10, notice, Paul commands the wife that is, that divorces her husband, to remain single or be reconciled, not to remarry. She must remain single, or to be reconciled back to her husband. She cannot remarry. She must remain single, but, notice, he never said about the man. See, you can't make the Word lie. \"From the beginning,\" the sex law by polygamy. Now, the Word of God runs true with nature of God, runs in to continuity. [I Corinthians 7:10-11]\n\nL-231 See how there is one school went east, and the other one went west, on it? You got to come back to the Truth, to find out what it is.\n\nL-232 It's always been that way, that's the regular covenant with God from the beginning. First, before the beginning, from the beginning there was just one and one. After the sin came in, then there was one man and a bunch of women; run that way in nature, every animal, and human beings and natural flesh is animal. We are mammal, we know that, all of us, see, and it's all God's nature in continuity.\n\nL-233 But now that the Seals are opened, the Spirit of Truth directs us to the Word. That explains why all the mistakes has been down through the ages, because the Seals was not opened, This was not revealed. It's true.\n\nL-234 Notice, you, you can't make the shadows fail. As I preached to you last night about the shadow across the floor, it's got to come out right. How can there be a shadow of an elephant coming across the floor, and a little bitty, spindly man come out to be the elephant, or the elephant to a little, spindly man?\n\nL-235 Now if you'll notice it in perfect type.\n\nL-236 Now, there is a true woman, a true woman, virgin, that marries her husband, and lives, and she is a blessed thing to the man. If God could have give His son any better thing than a wife, He would have give that to him.\n\nL-237 But she is designed to be a sex act, and no other animal is designed like that. No other creature on the earth is designed like that. That's the reason you see polygamy, because of that. That's what brought it in.\n\nL-238 Now look, in the final analysis, look, there is one Jesus Christ (is that right?), one Man, God, Immanuel. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] But the members of His Wife are many, see, thousands times thousands of thousands (is that right?), His Wife, the Bride, the Church. You understand now? [\"Amen.\"]\n\nL-239 That's why He said to Adam, before sex was ever induced or introduced, \"Multiply, to replenish the earth,\" when he was yet in the beginning, when he was yet both male and female in himself. There, shows then that the Bride has got to come from the Word, by spiritual multiplication, multiplications, see, replenishing the earth. [Genesis 9:1]\n\nL-240 Now in the sex act, see, the schools got those two things mixed up. Therefore you can't do it, you've got to bring it back to the Truth of it, \"in the beginning.\"\n\nL-241 And at the end there will be one Lord Jesus, and His Bride many, singular. You get it? There was one David on one throne, one king (after God's Own heart) with five hundred wives. Jesus sitting on His Throne, hallelujah, in the Millennium, with a Wife; like it was at the beginning, created out of the earth, by the hand of Almighty God, in the resurrection, of many members. There you are.\n\nL-242 Women, struggle to be that, come into Christ, then you'll not be in that filthy mess out there. But as long as you're just a church member trying to live moral and good, yourself, you'll never make it. Neither can a man make it outside of Christ. As Paul went on to say, \"But they're in Christ, there is neither male nor female.\" They're all one. [Galatians 3:28] 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min\n\nL-243 But to get this Marriage And Divorce straightened out, so that you would know which was right and which was wrong, now He plainly shows here in these types. There is one Christ; and many members of that Wife. Notice, He can put us away for spiritual fornications and false doctrine, any time He wants to; but how dare you try to put Him away, and make it? The man can put away his wife and marry another one; but not the woman put away her husband and marry another one. See all the shadows and types there perfectly balanced up? See the original creation; not the by-product nowhere. Not the church; the Bride through the Word. Not the woman; the man, each time. That's why it never says anything against the man doing it; it's always the woman. That's exactly. [Romans 12:4-5]\n\nL-244 But she can be the Bride of Christ, by being... And remember, she being a part of a man, the Bible said she can on-... \"Nevertheless I suffer not a woman to teach, or to usurp any authority, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, and then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the by-product was deceived. Notwithstanding she shall be saved if she continues in holiness and sobriety, and in childbearing, and all such,\" because then she becomes a part of this man. That's what bring... [I Timothy 2:12]\n\nL-245 Why didn't Abraham... Why didn't God kill Sarah sitting right there, denying, and lying right in the face of God? Sitting there as a mortal Man, eating flesh, eating bread, drinking milk, and He said, \"Why did Sarah laugh back there in the back,\" behind Him, in the tent, He had never seen her, \"saying this, 'How can these things be'?\" [Genesis 18:13]\n\nL-246 She said, \"I never said it!\" Uh-oh, my, tell God that He is a liar, to His face? But He couldn't take her. Why? She's a part of Abraham. Amen. He couldn't hurt her without hurting Abraham. [Genesis 18:15]\n\nL-247 Now you women see where you belong. And the Bible said, \"You women be like Sarah was, which adorned herself in modest apparel, lived honest and true to her own husband, loving him so much that (he) she called him her 'lord,'\" ruler, ownership. [I Timothy 2:9]\n\nL-248 And you, some of the women, put on these nasty clothes and get out here to throw yourself before man. Jesus said, \"Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.\" Then who is guilty, the man or you? He is a male, made so he could take this act, see; and you're the female, that ought to refuse. [Matthew 5:28]\n\nL-249 And why do you put yourself out like that? It ain't for comfort, you know it can't be, when you're half froze to death with them shorts on. See, can't be for comfort. Then what is it? It's for filth! You won't admit it, but it's the Bible says so. It's the Truth. It's a filthy spirit that's in you. You don't want to be filthy; but you don't realize, spiritually you are filthy, because you're presenting yourself filthy.\n\nL-250 Now, a man, his old, dirty, knotty knees, and if he had on hardly any clothes at all, wouldn't make any difference, his body is not tempting. Why? He was in the original creation, character; should be, see. But, you're the by-product, to tempt by.\n\nL-251 God, have mercy! Oh, my, this sinful world! I'll be glad when it's over.\n\nL-252 Notice, He can put away His wife any time He wants to, but she can't put Him away; He can make me, He can throw me in the dust any time He takes a notion to, but, oh, brother, I better never try to throw Him there, I am finished. [Matthew 19:7-8], [Mark 10:2-5], [Deuteronomy 24:1-4]\n\nL-253 Solomon could marry any woman that wasn't married, he could marry any woman he wanted to. A priest could marry only a woman that was a virgin. Solomon... [I Kings 11:1-4]\n\nL-254 Like David, he married (what was her name?) Abigail. Which, there was a man called a \"fool,\" he had a nice wife, and he died. And Abigail was married to David; he was a king, not a priest, see, so he--he married. [I Samuel 25:39-42]\n\nL-255 But a priest could not do that, because he had touched or got a woman to be his wife that was already been some man's wife. So that shows the virgincy of the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Bride will have to be unadulterated, the Word, not one Word missing nowhere. Certainly. Could you imagine a correct bride, one breast off, and, the other one, something another wrong, you know? That's not going to be the Bride of Christ. She is perfect. She is everything the Word, not one Word failing anywhere. No. [Leviticus 21:1, 7] 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min\n\nL-256 Notice, He can put her away, but she cannot put Him away. He did it, has proved it, in the days when Luther, Wesley, and Pentecost, when they refused to become the further part of Him by having spiritual sexual affair to become pregnated with further part of the Word. You understand? She refused. The Lutheran church refused for Christ to have any more desire with her; Luther refused it. And let me say this, going to call me something anyhow; so is it today with every one of them, they fail to take that Word, they refuse Christ! [Deuteronomy 24:1-4]\n\nL-257 And any woman that refuses a man his child, has no right to be a wife to him. Amen. You remember, in the Bible, when the king married Esther? Because the queen refused, he just got him another one. And when the... What happened when she refused to come out with the king and obey him? The same thing it is with a woman that refuses to be wife to her husband. [Esther 1:11-12, 19]\n\nL-258 And so is it with the church that refuses to become pregnated in the age that we now live in, to bring forth children of this age. We are not Lutherans, we're not Wesleys, neither are we Pentecostals! We've got to be the children of this age, through the pregnancy of the Word of God, to bring forth a Child of this age, the Seed Child. Amen. I hope you understand. Couldn't be pregnated, no, so what did He do? Put her away, in divorcement. That's right. But she daresn't put Him away. He put her away.\n\nL-259 He went right on revealing His Word to the Body, and vindicating Him, same, by Himself. His children begin to kind of look more like Him, because It's fully maturing, or, they become children of the Word, not children of the church. Children of the Word! And the Bride will be a lovely little Lady of the Word, unadulterated, not touched by any man's organization, any man-made theory. She'll be purely unadulterated, Bride of the Word! Amen and amen! I hope you get that, out on the air. She will be the pregnated daughter of God.\n\nL-260 See what a great honor a woman can be? See what a great thing the church can be, but you see where filth has got her to? Then trying to compare that church out there with the Church here, you can't do it. And try to compare the street harlot with the Church of the living God; or the woman, the correct woman, with a harlot?\n\nL-261 Why is there such things as that? It's a law of God, the law of contrasts. How will we know how to enjoy the daylight if there wasn't a night? How will we know how to enjoy the dry weather if there wasn't rain? How would we know to enjoy and respect a real woman, if there wasn't a dirty one?\n\nL-262 Went right on revealing It, revealing His Word, but dare any one of us to try to put away Him and marry another.\n\nL-263 Now surely it's plain why both theories are wrong. You can't make it run this way, it's gone; you make it run that, it'd run plumb past the promise. Here is the promise, here is the thing right here. The Word is not contradictory. It has to stay in continuity now, no more than Matthew 28:19 contradicts Acts 2:38. [Matthew 28:19], [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-264 Now, some of you women, some of you man, I--I know you're--you're disagreeing with It. Cause, you know, you can't hide that right now. You can't.\n\nL-265 But let me just show you something. If Matthew 28:19 said, \"Go ye therefore, teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Ghost,\" and they turned around, and every person that was ever baptized was baptized contrary to that, baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, for even all through the Bible age and for three hundred years after the Bible age, to the Nicaea Council. Then they adopted dogmas instead. What's the difference, if it isn't revealed? [Matthew 28:19]\n\nL-266 And do you know the whole Book, the whole Bible, is a revelation? That's how you have to know the truth between this one and the other, it's because It's a revelation. And the revelation must be exactly with the Word, not contrary to the Word. You say, \"Well, I, it was revealed to me.\" Then if it's contrary to the Word, it never come from God. That's right.\n\nL-267 Now if you want to take Mat-... Matthew 16:18. Jesus said, Himself, that the entire Church, His Church, would be built upon spiritual revelation of Himself, which is the Word. \"I say unto thee, that thou art Peter... And flesh and blood never revealed this to you, but My Father which is in Heaven has revealed this to you. And upon this rock...\" [Matthew 16:18] 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min\n\nL-268 Now, I know, our Catholic friends there, you say, \"It was built upon Peter, and Peter the apostolic, so, So-and-so, in an apostolic consent, succession.\" The Protestants said, \"It was built upon Jesus Christ.\"\n\nL-269 Not to be different, but take just what He said! He said, \"Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father which is in Heaven has revealed this to you. And upon this rock, spiritual revelation of what the Word is, I'll build My Church; and the gates of hell will never shake It down.\" His Wife will not be tempted with other man. \"I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell can never shake It.\" [Matthew 16:15-19]\n\nL-270 And Abel and Cain, in the garden of Eden. Cain drawed his own conception, he said, \"Now, look, God is a good God. He is over all nature, so I'll get the beans and potatoes, and I'll get the--the flowers, and I'll make Him a real pretty altar.\" That's a church. He knelt down. He believed God. He worshiped God, put up his hands, and offered this sacrifice. He done everything religious that Abel did. [Genesis 1:3-4]\n\nL-271 Abel built the same kind of an altar. But when Abel brought his, he brought a lamb. Now, Cain thought that, making an antidote for sin, that his father and mother must have eat fruit, as they were taught in that garden. But Abel, by Divine revelation, knowed that it was the blood that did it. By Divine revelation! And the Bible said in Hebrews, the 12th chapter, 11th chapter, that, \"Abel, by faith, revelation, offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which God testified that he was righteous.\" Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Amen! Brother, sister, it's just as plain as anything can be, to me. There is the whole thing. [Hebrews 11:4]\n\nL-272 Now on the Marriage And Divorce, see, it has to be revealed. Until it's revealed, you don't know it. But He promised in this last days, in this age, that every hidden mystery in the Bible would be revealed. How many knows that? Revelation, the 10th chapter! Jesus promised it, that all of these hidden mysteries on--on Marriage And Divorce, all these other hidden mysteries that's been, would be revealed in the end time. Now you remember, the Voice said, \"Go to Tucson.\" Remember the mystic Light in the sky; the seventh Angel standing there; come back, and the opening of the Seven Seals? Watch what's taken place. That is true. [Revelation 10:7]\n\nL-273 Now just a little bit farther. But now hear, ye! I know it's getting time for you to go eat, but I'm just eating fine. [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-274 Notice, now, the woman has got her place, and she is a jewel. Solomon, this man that had ten thousand wives... or had a thousand wives, rather, he said that, \"A man that's found a wife, has found a good thing.\" He said, \"A good woman is a jewel in his crown,\" that's an honor. \"But an unrighteous one is water in his blood,\" that's his life. He said, \"There might be one righteous man found in a thousand,\" Solomon said this, \"but,\" said, \"you wouldn't find one righteous woman in a thousand.\" Solomon said that, see. Now notice that, that how it is. [Ecclesiastes 7:28]\n\nL-275 But, you see, woman, you are--you are a jewel if you want to be a jewel, but the desire has to be by you. And you see why the Marriage And Divorce was, that Jesus pointed back yonder, it was because your kind was the cause of all sin. That's the reason polygamy and divorce, and things, was introduced. At the beginning it never was so, and it won't be so in the world over yonder.\n\nL-276 Look at Jacob, out of whom come the patriarchs. He had at least a dozen wives. He married two sisters, and had concubine wives besides that, common-law women that he lived with. And those patriarchs was born right out of those concubine women. Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] See, you have to make the Word run smooth.\n\nL-277 Oh, I got pages on them. If a clergyman ever questions me on it, and we would get together, we could talk it. But surely, if he's got any spirituality at all, he can see right here it's the Truth. There is no question to It.\n\nL-278 A good woman is a good thing. I know that. I know it by real women. I have met real women that's genuine, just as real as any man that ever walked.\n\nL-279 She is a by-product and a piece of him, and in the fall he listened to her. He just... She is part of him. But, it's up to her, she is made so she can be filthy, and she is given the right to refuse or to accept. That's contrary to the original nature at the beginning, see, but there you are. [Genesis 2:21-24] 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min\n\nL-280 Now it's twelve o'clock, so I'll just omit something here for a few minutes. I want to ask you something.\n\nL-281 Now, remember, I say this to just my group only. And out in the air, I'm saying this to only my own followers. This Message is only to them, and what I'm going to say here.\n\nL-282 Any minister, he, that's his, yeah, he's the shepherd of the flock, let him do whatever he wants to. That's up to him and God. Any priest, any preacher, that's up to you, my brother.\n\nL-283 I'm only speaking here in Jeffersonville, the only place I would speak this at, is because it's my own flock. It's the flock that the Holy Ghost give me to understand to be overseer over, and He will hold me responsible for it. And these people of mine has been converts here from across the land, that I've led to Christ. And, little children, I'm here to help you, and I am your friend. You might think I speak against you; I'm saying this, see, for your good. I love you. And if that isn't so, God is my Judge. You know I love you.\n\nL-284 This is an awful strong thing, I didn't know how to bring it out. What will I do, when I got men and women sitting in my congregation, some of them has been married twice or three times? Good man and good women, all mixed up! What done it? False teaching, exactly, not waiting on the Lord.\n\nL-285 \"What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.\" Not what man joined together; what \"God\" joined together! When you've got a direct revelation from God, that's your wife, and the same thing, that's yours, the rest of your life. See? But what man joins together, anybody can put apart. But what God joins together, no man better dare to touch it. \"Whatsoever God joins together,\" He said, \"let no man put asunder.\" Not what some half-drunk magistrate or something else put together, or some backslidden preacher with a bunch of creeds in a book, that would let them do anything in the world, and the Word of God laying right there. See? I'm talking about what God joined together. [Matthew 19:6]\n\nL-286 Now I'm going to say this to you. I am very careful what I say to you. I don't mean to be rough with you people. I don't mean to be rough with you, my pastor brothers. I don't mean that. But I am responsible, realizing that this has been given into my hands. And if... I can't hold It. I don't know how to give It out, and I know that this tape will. Oh, my, I'll just get ready, the office open up, 'cause here it comes. See?\n\nL-287 Just like it was on The Serpent's Seed, but it's absolutely proven to be right. I got papers right here, out of the paper, where women right now... and even in--in the great... Some of the great dioceses has got the pictures of the original, a snake crawling on a woman's leg, and just in how it goes around her; she has all kinds of sensations and things, something a man could never touch her with, with this huge snake wrapping around her, and so forth. That's exactly the truth. And it's going worse and worse, and will get worse. Serpent, which he was not, he could not have had the sex affair with her when he was a serpent, but remember...\n\nL-288 I was having a debate the other day with a... not a debate, just an Assembly of God minister and associate, said, \"You're wrong, on That.\" I said, \"Well, I may be. I'd like for you to tell me.\"\n\nL-289 He said then, went ahead and begin to talk about it. First thing you know, he got hisself lost. And one thing he said, he said, \"Brother Branham, where is that specie? God said 'one of his kind.' Now where is that specie you said was between man and beast, that science can't find now? Where is he at?\" Said, \"Is he on the earth? Was he a chimpanzee?\"\n\nL-290 \"No, because a chimpanzee's blood won't mix with a woman, no other animal will mix with her. No, it won't, nor neither will a man's sperm mix with the--with the female. It won't do it.\"\n\nL-291 \"Then where is that certain animal? Now, God said, 'Let everything bring forth of its kind.'\" [Genesis 1:11]\n\nL-292 I waited just a minute. And the sweetness of the Holy Spirit said, \"Tell him, 'It's here.'\" Now, at first I said, \"Well, it may have become distinct.\" He said, \"But, Brother Branham, that, we are talking about the Word, aren't we?\"\n\nL-293 I said, \"Yes, sir.\" And I said, \"They, course, claim that the other things, like dinosaurs and--and mammoth, and so 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min forth, mammoths, mammoths, rather, they are distinct, and so forth.\" I said, \"It could have been that.\"\n\nL-294 He said, \"Brother Branham, we are talking about proof of the Word. If sin is here; then, the original sin, it ought to be here also.\"\n\nL-295 And I said, \"Lord Jesus, You said, 'Take no thought what you shall say when you come before man, because it'll be given to you in that hour.' Lord, what shall I say?\" He said, \"Tell him, 'It's here.'\" Just the same as I see the visions on the platform.\n\nL-296 I said, \"It's here,\" not knowing where. He said, \"Where?\" And before I could even think, He said, \"It's the serpent.\" [Matthew 10:19]\n\nL-297 That's exactly what it was, for he is no longer a beast. He was cursed and put on his belly for the rest of his days. He is here. Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] And still in that act that he done, there is still the same sin works around a woman, like a male sex like that. There is where she has her walleyed conditions and things, when she has her sensations far beyond what any man could ever do.\n\nL-298 I'll stop there 'cause we're in a mixed crowd. I'll get some men, I'll... we'll talk more about it. Got all the papers and things laying right here, right at my hand right now, and I was going to bring it to you this morning. I was going to take the full day in this, but I'll close now in saying this.\n\nL-299 This is to my church only. Not my church... The little flock that believes me and follows me, this is to them.\n\nL-300 The other day, knowing that when I tell you anything, it must come THUS SAITH THE LORD, then I had the Scriptures as He revealed it to me. But, \"Lord God, what can I say to that congregation? I'll have separations. Man will be sitting on the porch and out in the yard, and everywhere else, 'Shall I leave her?' Women, 'Shall I leave my husband?' 'What shall I do?'\" I said, \"Lord, what can I do?\"\n\nL-301 Something said to me, \"Go up yonder in the mountain, and I'll talk to you.\"\n\nL-302 And while I was up in the mountain, not knowing that down in Tucson they were seeing It. But even the teachers called the children from... my little girl and them, from the schoolroom, and said, \"Look yonder in that mountain! There is a fiery-looking amber Cloud going up in the air and coming back down, going up in the air and coming back down.\"\n\nL-303 Mrs. Evans, are you here? Ronnie, you here? I come on back down by the station, this young boy by the filling station, the Evans' filling station there. And before I knowed what the boy was going to say, he took me on my feet, he said, \"Brother Branham, you was up in that mountain over yonder, wasn't you?\"\n\nL-304 I said, \"What do you mean, Ronnie? No,\" see, to see what he was going to do. A lot of times things happen, I don't, you don't say it to people. It become... The thing of it is, you see so much happening, it becomes common to you. See? I just don't tell the people. I said, \"Ronnie, what was you...\"\n\nL-305 He said, \"I can show you right where you were at.\" Said, \"I called mama, and we stood here and watched that Cloud hanging up in yonder, going up and down. I said, 'It's got to be Brother Branham sitting up in there somewhere. That's God talking to him.'\"\n\nL-306 And the whole city, people, looked at It. On a bright day with no clouds nowhere at all, with this big amber Cloud hanging there; coming down like a funnel, and going back and spreading out.\n\nL-307 Friends, and then I'm closing, you can go from this. That's when This was being revealed to me, what I'm going to tell you right now, so don't miss It.\n\nL-308 Now I'm speaking to our followers only, who is following me and this Message only, not the outside. Bear me record of this before God. Just to this group only!\n\nL-309 Now we are found in this mess because of misinterpreted theology. Is that right? That's why you women married the second time, and you men, because misinterpreted theology. Now I want to show you something that He told me. 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min\n\nL-310 And if God, our Creator, was questioned the question when He was here on earth, Jesus Christ; and when His delivering prophet came forth, Moses, down in Egypt, to bring the children out of--of Egypt, to put them in the promised land; and Jesus said here that Moses seen the people in this condition, and he granted them a writing of divorcement, because the situation was what it was. Moses found such, as, \"Let him suffer...\" God permitted Moses, that prophet sent to the people, to grant this writing of divorcement to them.\n\nL-311 And in First Corinthians, the--the 7th chapter, the 12th and 15th verse, in the New Testament prophet, Paul, who met the same thing in the church, and spoke this, \"This is I, not the Lord.\" That right? Because of the divorce condition. [I Corinthians 7:12]\n\nL-312 \"It wasn't so from the beginning.\" But Moses was permitted it, and God recognized it righteousness. And Paul also had a right, when he found his church in that condition. [Matthew 19:8]\n\nL-313 Now you believe This to be true, and believe It to come from God! And by the vindication of His Cloud and His Message that's brought me this far, should not God upon the mountain permit me to do the same thing, to suffer you to go on the way you are, and do it no more! Go with your wives and live in peace, for the hour is late. The Coming of the Lord is at hand. We haven't got time to break these things up. Don't you dare try to do it again! I'm speaking only to my congregation. But if you are married... And God bore me witness of that, on the mountain, that I could say This, a supernatural revelation, because of the opening of the Seven Seals, and this is a question in God's Word. \"Let them go on in as they are, and sin no more!\"\n\nL-314 \"It wasn't so from the beginning.\" That is right, it wasn't so, and it will not be at the end. But under modern conditions, as God's servant... I won't call myself His prophet; but I believe maybe, if I wouldn't be sent for that, I'm laying a ground for him when he does come. So under the modern conditions, I command you to go to your home, with your wife now. If you are happy with her, live with her, raise your children in the admonition of God. But God be merciful to you if you ever do that again! You teach your children to never do a thing like that, bring them up in the admonition of God. And now that you are as you are, let us go now, at the late evening hour that we're living in, and \"press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ,\" where all things will be possible. [Matthew 19:8], [Mark 10:5-6]\n\nL-315 Until I see you tonight, the Lord God bless you, while we pray.\n\nL-316 Lord God, we give You thanks. We give You praise. Thou art the same great Jehovah that suffered Moses. Moses, that servant, and what would he tell his people? And, God, You suffered him to give a writing of divorcement. Paul, the great apostle who was the writer of the New Testament, as Moses was of the Old. Moses wrote the Laws and a dispensation of laws. Many of the prophets, their words was injected into It, but Moses wrote the Laws. And You suffered him a writing, to write them a writing of divorcement, because of the hardness of their heart. [Deuteronomy 24:1-4], [Matthew 19:8]\n\nL-317 The great Saint Paul, being the writer of the New Testament, could also make such an assertion, that, \"I speak under these conditions; I, not the Lord.\" [I Corinthians 7:10]\n\nL-318 So is it today, Lord God, at the end of the world, as we are here under the mercy of God, knowing that soon we are to answer in His Presence. And that You have did so much, Lord, I am sure, in the sight of these people, they'll hang onto This like It come from You. And to bear record here today, of many people sitting here that even saw that Sign up in the mountain, where the Angels of the Lord came in the whirlwind, where it came in the seven Angels, where the revealing of the Seven Mysteries was unfolded; and that same Angel, in the same direction, on the same mountain, the day that This was revealed!\n\nL-319 God, I pray that the people will go home being thankful that God has granted this grace to them. I only spoke It, Lord, through permission. And I only say It through permission, Lord. And let the people be so grateful that they'll never try to do that sin again! And may they never try to do any sin, but love You with all their hearts. Lord, make these families happy, and may they grow and raise their children in the admonition of God.\n\nL-320 For, my Message that was on my heart is delivered, Lord. I've done all I know how to do. And Satan has fought me for weeks, and hours without sleep. But now I command It, Lord, to these people, that they study It, and go and live 65-0221M, Marriage And Divorce, Park View Junior High School, Jeffersonville, IN, 147 min for You. Grant it, Lord. It's off my shoulders now. They're in Your hands. I pray that You will bless them.\n\nL-321 Bless these handkerchiefs, Lord, that's just been set on here, for the sick and afflicted. May this night be one of the greatest, powerful nights, that all the people will be healed. Grant it, Lord. Bless us together.\n\nL-322 May we go in peace, happy and rejoicing, because the God of creation has showed us \"since the beginning,\" and has extended to us, in our mess that we're in, His grace again, in this last days. O Great and Eternal God, how we thank You for it! And may our hearts be so happy, that we'll never have another desire to sin against You. In Jesus' Name. Amen. I love Him, (why shouldn't you love Him?) I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's...\n\nL-323 I say it now so the ministers will understand. This is to them that follows this Message only!\n\nL-324 Oh, are you happy? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] I have told you the Truth, THUS SAITH THE LORD, all the way through! [\"Amen!\"]\n\nL-325 Now let us stand and raise our hands, as we sing it again, \"I love Him.\" I love Him for His grace. I love Him for His mercy. I love Him for His Word. \"And the Word of the Lord came to the prophets!\" I love Him.\n\nL-326 Come on, brother. [Brother Branham has someone to come and dismiss the congregation--Ed.] Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O. Box 4951 Naperville, IL 60567 USA Email: thevoice1017@lwbcast.org http://www.lwbcast.org/ The Easter Seal"}, {"id": "65-0410 - The Easter Seal.txt", "text": "L-1 Certainly a privilege to be here this morning, on this birthday of the Full Gospel Business Men's chapter here at Phoenix, and to know that the Lord granted me a little part of it, to be part of this fellowship. I want to greet Brother Carl Williams and his wife, Brother Stromei, the rest here at the platform, Brother Shores, Brother Outlaw, the ministers, and all you fine people.\n\nL-2 You know, I--I had a birthday last week, too. And I'm just a teeny bit older than a chapter. I believe he said, \"Five and... years old, for the chapter.\"\n\nL-3 Somebody said, other day, said, \"How old are you, Brother Branham?\" I said \"Twenty-six.\" And I said, \"I wiped out the first twenty-five years. I didn't serve Him so well in them.\" I said, \"I hope He does, too.\" To get Him to do it will be different.\n\nL-4 But it's good to be here. And now we want to not take much of your time. Because we... I'm--I'm always afraid, after I hear some of these fine testimonies, and things that's going on, that I... and songs, that I will do something that'll upset that. And I wanted to add to it, if there'd be anything I could add to it. These sisters...\n\nL-5 That brother that sang the song this morning, the colored brother, I appreciated that, The Eye On The Sparrow.\n\nL-6 And these sisters that sang this song, that's been one of my helps since I was here the first time. I have that. I got that on a record, and I've just played it out, I'd Like To Talk It Over With Him. And I asked Brother Dawson Riley there, my friend, if he would, some of them, if they'd see if they get those ladies, if they were still here on earth, to sing it again this morning. And I hope Terry got it. And I suppose he did. I want to take that off there, maybe, to a record or something, 'cause I really like that song. And that's my--my desire, is to talk it over with Him. I think we all want to do that. That's why we're here this morning.\n\nL-7 Now, the oncoming meetings, next week. Is it all right to mention? [A brother says, \"Sure.\"--Ed.] I--I to be home this coming week, at the tabernacle, next Sunday, for Easter service; Saturday night, Sunday, and Sunday night. And then I go back to California. All you people around California, be sure glad to have you at the meeting over there. And I think Billy has sent out the wrong advertisement. Is... He said, \"At the Biltmore Hotel,\" I believe, \"it's to be at.\" It's... [Someone says, \"Couldn't get it.\"] Couldn't get it. And it's at the Eastmont? [\"Embassy.\"] Embassy, the Embassy Hotel. So any of the Full Gospel people over there would let you know, if you're over that way.\n\nL-8 And then we come back from there, and I go to South Africa then. Just one month from today, we sail for South Africa, expecting a great time in the Lord, about three nations down there. So we--we certainly solicit your prayers. I probably won't be able to see you no more, if the Lord carries on for us to go, until I get back. And hope I have a great report for you when we come back.\n\nL-9 Last time down there, I think that the Lord gave me the greatest meeting I ever had. And one time, for an altar call... Now, this is out of blanket natives. As far as I know, there was thirty thousand accepted Christ at one time. And we thought maybe they meant physical healing, because there had been about twenty-five thousand healed at one time. And the next day, the mayor of--of Durban, which is Sydney Smith, said, \"Go to your window, look coming down the street.\" And there were van load after van load, just piled full of old crutches and things, just piled up, that they were coming behind. The natives, which was at war with one another, coming down the streets of the city, singing Only Believe in their native tongue.\n\nL-10 I tell you, my heart thrilled. Like... When you see something like that, Brother Shores, you to feel your work is not in vain then. You see, you tried. And I hope that God repeats it again, not because--because we're going down there, but because we're looking for the Coming of the Lord.\n\nL-11 And as the song said, we're seeking out that little, lost sheep. That's that... He--He won't come until that sheep is in. Every one has to be in the fold. He won't close the door till that last one is in. So, minister brothers, I'm sure with you, 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min this morning, of trying to hunt out that last sheep. It might be in Phoenix, this morning. I don't know. But when the last one comes in, then the Shepherd will close the door. [Luke 15:4]\n\nL-12 [A brother says, \"Brother Branham?\"--Ed.] Yes? [\"Could I just say a word?\"] You certainly can. [\"I forgot something. We've been talking about...\" Blank.spot.on.tape.] That's perfectly all right. [\"And I know, everybody forgets something, once in a while.\"] I don't. [\"Oh!\"]\n\nL-13 I'm the one that has to write out what I'm going to say, almost. I'm... Since I getting older, I find it harder to remember, put my Scriptures down, and so forth. Used to be, I could line up about fifty Scriptures in my mind, and never even... pass right on through it, but I got a lot of rough miles behind them days.\n\nL-14 So, we're looking for the Coming of the Lord. Lord bless you all!\n\nL-15 And then you get up here, and you think. You set down here and hear these people testify. You think, \"Well, when I get up, I'm going to say something about that.\" Then, there's so much to say, you'd be all day saying it. But, I certainly appreciate you all. May this little chapter just keep growing. May every church in Phoenix continually to grow until Jesus comes, is my sincere prayer.\n\nL-16 Now, I think, just to rest us just a little bit, let's stand while we have prayer. Will you?\n\nL-17 Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who raised Him up from the dead, and has give Him unto us as the sacrifice, and a Lord and Saviour. We are so grateful to Thee for this privilege that we have this morning, to stand in Thy Presence, with Thy people that's been redeemed and looking for His glorious second Coming, to receive us unto Himself. If there be sin among us, Lord, purge us with Thy hyssop. And we pray, Heavenly Father, that You will heal every sick person that's in our midst. [Psalms 51:7]\n\nL-18 And if there would be, by chance, those who doesn't know You, in this great baptism of the Holy Spirit that we're so earnestly contending for, and saying it is a must, according to the Scripture for this last day. We pray, God, that He will fall upon us all, today, and baptize us a freshly into the Body, and bring those that are out, in, too, Father. [Jude 1:3], [Acts 4:31]\n\nL-19 Bless us as we read Thy Word and endeavor to speak that which is Truth of Thy Word. Close our mouths to that which is untruth, and open our hearts and mouths to that which is Truth, as we commit ourselves to Thee. Use our mouths to speak, and our ears to hear, and our hearts to receive. For we ask it in Jesus' Name, Who has ordained it to be so. Amen.\n\nL-20 I would like to read from the Holy Word, three places in the Bible. And if you would mark these, and you want to carry them on through, to read them for further information, I'd be very happy if you would mark them down. The places I'm going to read is Matthew 28:1-10, and then Revelations 1:17-18, Romans 8:11. May I repeat them again. And now Matthew 28:1 to 10, Revelations 1:17 to 18, and Romans 8:11. [Matthew 28:1-10], [Revelation 1:17-18], [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-21 Now we are approaching Easter. And as you're getting your places, and marking it down. I think that this coming week is the most and the greatest historical week of all of the weeks of the year. I think that the greatest thing we will celebrate this week, this coming week, was the greatest event that ever taken place on the earth. I don't think anything could surpass it. You say, \"Well, the--the crucifixion was great.\" But many men has died, many men has been crucified, even in the same days of our Lord. But there was only One of Them Who rose up from the dead. That sealed it.\n\nL-22 Now I want to read. And this is kind of a little pre-Easter message, the Lord willing, about forty minutes. Now let's read from Saint Matthew's Gospel, the 28th chapter, beginning. In the end of the sabbath, as it begin to dawn towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:And for fear of him the quakers did... the keepers (pardon me) did shake, and became as dead men.And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear ye not: for I know that you seek Jesus, which was crucified.He is not here: for he is risen, 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min as he said. Come and see the place where the Lord lay.And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead: and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run and bring the disciples word.And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worship him.Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. [Matthew 28:1-10]\n\nL-23 And Revelations, the 1st chapter, and the 17th and 18th verse. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of death and hell. [Revelation 1:17-18]\n\nL-24 And in the Book of Romans, the 8th chapter, and beginning with the 11th verse. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-25 Now I trust that the Lord Jesus will add His blessings to the readings of these Words. Seeing that, Easter, I have stamped it in my own heart as the greatest meeting, or the greatest event of the--the year.\n\nL-26 I want to ask you to pardon me a moment. Isn't that kind of blaring out there to you, kind of a roaring? Is it all right? Can you hear it all right like that? Oh! You can't hear it. Is that better, right like that? I didn't want to get too close.\n\nL-27 Now, why I say this, is because that, Easter, He proved what the Bible had said. All the Scripture that was written of Him to do, He sealed His Messiahship when He rose from the dead, the Easter seal. We have so much of it today we talk about, that, buying Easter seals. Well, I want to speak this morning on: The Easter Seal. It's a different seal than what we buy with our money, as a seal to go on letters for, I think, the Tuberculosis Association or whatever they call it. I--I think this seal is a little different seal. And being that Easter is the great day of the year for we Christians who claim to be God's children, I want to try to break into it and see how we should be fellowship with this great thing that Christ did for us. [Acts 10:41]\n\nL-28 The Word of God was spoken many, many hundreds of years before His Coming, of His crucifixion, and of His death, and of His suffering, and also of His resurrection. We'll be going through these services, perhaps, next week, as we listen to our--our radio programs; and in our churches, with our pastors, and so forth, this coming week. [Isaiah 53:1-12]\n\nL-29 But of all the days and all of the things that Jesus did, and certainly appreciating all of His vindication of God's Word and what He did to fulfill It: of healing the sick, raising the dead, casting out devils, preaching the Gospel to the poor, and fulfilling every Word that God said that He would do when He came; and then also suffering for our sins, in our stead, to be the propitiation for sin, at the cross, where no one else could have done it but Him. But above all of that, I think Easter sealed the whole thing. [Matthew 10:8], [Luke 9:2]\n\nL-30 Because, there had been prophets on the earth, who had prophesied before Him. There had been prophets on the earth, who had healed the sick, even raised the dead, and done the same signs that Jesus did. [II Kings 8:5], [II Kings 5:10]\n\nL-31 But Easter proved it. It sealed the Word of God forever, for the true believer. All gloom and doubt was shattered, at that blessful morning. Man had been shut up, as it was, in a prison house, even to religious people before this day, because they had been... seen great religious moves, and moving of the Holy Spirit, and so forth. But when a man died, it seemed to settle it. But when this One came, and said, \"I have power to lay My life down; I have power to take It up again.\" And then go prove what He said. To me, that--that's the seal of it, when--when something is said and then is turned around and proven. [John 10:18]\n\nL-32 If a man said, like Columbus, believed the world was round, and he watched the ships, as we're told, how they come in, and he could see the mast way before he could see the ship. And it proved him that the world was round. 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min People didn't believe that in that day, but he was a man of vision. He set out to prove exactly what he had a vision of, that was the truth.\n\nL-33 And God purposed to prove His Word, the Truth. So He... There was only one Man that could do that, and that was Jesus. And He come and proved that to be the Truth. It sealed it. And that broke all the seals of gloom, and scattered all the--the superstitions of other religions, and so forth, where great men has raised up and said great, marvelous things; but they're, every one, in the grave. But our Christian religion is the only one who has the empty tomb. And that proves to me that He is the God of the dead, and God of the living, that He could raise up the dead, back to life again. And this quickening power, quickening Spirit of His, has proved through the years that He is the One Who can quicken the dead, back to life again. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-34 And when He proved by His promise, this great conquering power that He had, on Easter He proved that He could conquer death, hell, and the grave. \"I am He that was dead, and is alive again, and alive forevermore; and have the keys to--to death, hell, and the grave.\" What a--a statement for anyone to make. And not only did He make it, but He had already proved that He--He had what He claimed to have. , [Revelation 1:18]\n\nL-35 And I think, God hasten the day that when we, as Christians who believe this Bible, can prove what we are talking about. See? That's what makes, as said a while ago, \"The salt of the earth,\" the sister said. That's right. The world is looking for this salt. And when we can prove by our lives, and by the Bible, that our lives are vindicating that Word to be living today, that that's the day we're looking for. [Colossians 4:6], [Matthew 5:13]\n\nL-36 The Word, \"This Spirit...\" Romans 8 there, that 11, said, \"If this Spirit that raised up Jesus Christ be in you, will also quicken your mortal bodies.\" Not only did He prove to Him, to us, that He was Jehovah Redeemer and had power over death, hell and the grave, but He has also give us the access to the same Spirit, that we ourselves can have the assurance that we too are quickened by that Spirit. For the Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in your body. It will also quicken your mortal body. Now, the word quicken means \"to be made alive after death.\" After it's dead, then it's to be quickened. [Romans 8:11], [Revelation 1:18]\n\nL-37 The world has been shut up in doubt, for many ages until then. This was proven, not only talked about, but was proven. I think that anything that's worthwhile...\n\nL-38 As Jesus said, \"Go ye therefore, teach all nations; and prove to them, by demonstrating the power of God to them. These signs shall follow them that believe.\" Them who promise and say they believe, He give us a definite understanding of it, that, \"These signs would follow them that believe.\" It would be the proof of their testimony. Now, we can say we believe. But until we are have the proven sign that He said that would be upon us, then we are just confessing to be believers, and not the possession of believers. [Matthew 28:19], [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-39 For, remember, a few days ago, I was listening to a--a radio program on KAIR down in Tucson. And this minister had taken the side against us, that, \"The pentecostal religion was nothing but just a sham. There was... Not to listen to it. It was unstable.\" And said, \"Any man that spoke in tongues, and these things, and claim to be, heal the sick, and so forth, by prayer, that it was to leave away from it. And to pray for those poor decrepit people, because that they were in a--an illusion, that there was something wrong with them.\" Oh, how I could have liked to have talked to that brother just a while! And he said that the... \"That, that was only given for the apostles at the Day of Pentecost, and that was all.\"\n\nL-40 I find that, thirty years later, Paul was ordaining these gifts in the Church. In First Corinthians 15, that, \"He set in the Church the gift of speaking in tongues, miracles. And all these other gifts was set in the Church.\" [I Corinthians 12:1-31]\n\nL-41 Jesus said that. \"Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.\" How far? \"All the world.\" Who to? \"Every creature.\" They've never received It yet. \"And these signs shall follow them that believe.\" How long? \"All the world.\" Who to? \"Every creature. These signs shall follow them, in all the world, and in every creature. These signs shall follow them: in My Name they shall cast out devils; speak with new tongues; if they taken up a deadly thing, or serpent, or drinking a deadly thing, will not harm them; they'll lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\" That 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min was His last commission to the Church, Mark the 16th chapter. [Mark 16:15], [Luke 9:2], [Mark 16:18], [Matthew 28:19]\n\nL-42 Paul is ordaining these gifts into the Church, thirty years later. And said, in Galatians 1:8, \"If an Angel from Heaven preaches to you any other Gospel than This which is already received,\" see, already been preached, \"let him be accursed.\" I believe that pentecost began without an ending. I believe it's to be to every creature, all times, at all places, that pentecost should always remain. The pentecostal blessings should be upon the people. [Galatians 1:8]\n\nL-43 And now, what is this pentecostal blessing? It's the confirmation of the resurrection. No wonder the Gospel Itself means \"good news.\" Good news of what? He has raised from the dead. \"And because I live, ye live also.\" Ye which were once dead in sin and trespasses, God has quickened us together, by that Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead. And we are now setting in Heavenly places with Him, communing with Him, talking with Him. What a joy to tell people that story, that believes it to be the Truth! [Romans 8:11], [John 14:19]\n\nL-44 I'm wondering, today. It's what's happening. Are we really getting the people to God? Are we just getting them to church? We must get them to Christ, where this quickening power. It's good to go to church. Sure. If that's as far as we go, it's not far enough. When you come to church, that's good; but go on to Christ, from the church, because we must receive this quickening power, if we ever expect to be in that general resurrection, because it's the only thing that will ever bring us from the dead. \"For if this Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, It'll also quicken, make, bring to life your mortal bodies.\" What a promise to us! [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-45 Now notice. The very essence of this resurrection is to tell and to show, and to prove that Jesus has raised up from the dead. He's not dead. He's a living. He lives here. He's in us. \"I'll be with you, even in you. A little while and the world seeth Me no more. Yet, ye shall see Me, for I will be with you, even in you, unto the end of the world.\" [Matthew 28:20], [John 14:19]\n\nL-46 Now, as Christians, we all claim He is alive, or we been quickened from--quickened from life... from death to Life, by His Spirit. And if we haven't been quickened, then we've not been made alive. [Ephesians 2:1]\n\nL-47 Now we're going to break into this subject, the Lord willing, and kind of teach it for a few minutes, how that: are we quickened, and can we be sure that this is the Truth?\n\nL-48 Now, this is your own life, this is my life. It's where that the... If this isn't Truth, what I'm fixing to say, then I'm one of the most foolish people in the world. I've give my life for something there's nothing to, and so have you. But if it is the Truth, then I owe everything that I am. I owe everything that I could be, to the cause, of which we're standing for. And I think that we mustn't lose our enthusiasm.\n\nL-49 And as we see Easter approaching, it just does something down in me, as I--I know that that's the day that the thing was sealed forever, in the sight of God.\n\nL-50 Now, we notice, it's the same Spirit that raised Him from the grave, that is dwelling in us. Now, how could that be? The Spirit that raised up, God, Jesus from the dead, has dwelling in us. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-51 Now, now, is the Spirit that quickens. It's not the Word that quickens. It's the Spirit that quickens the Word, or gives the Word Life, gives It wings to fly, gives It access. It's the Spirit that does that. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-52 Now, the wheat, alone, is just a wheat; but when the quickening life gets into it, into the wheat, then it gives it life. And we which were once dead, made in the image of God, and yet dead in sin and trespass, there's some way God had to get this quickening Life into your mortal bodies. I'm talking about your body. [Ephesians 2:1]\n\nL-53 Now, Jesus was the Word. You believe that, don't you? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] \"In the beginning...\" Saint John 1, \"In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\" [John 1:1, 14]\n\nL-54 Now, as the promised Messiah, He quickened every Word that was prophesied that He would do; heal the sick, and how He would be born of a virgin, all that, made it. It's true. He was the Word, manifested here on earth, but He could not do this just as a Man. It taken the Spirit of God, dwelling in Him, to quicken these promises to Him. I hope that we get this real clear now. Jesus, being a Man, Himself, the body, but it took the Spirit in Him, the Spirit. \"It's not 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min Me that doeth the works. It's My Father that dwelleth in Me. He's the One that does the works.\" See? Jesus Himself was the Word, because He was. Before God... [John 14:10]\n\nL-55 This is a bad word to use, and I hope you take it right, before a crowd. But He was predestinated by the foreknowledge of God, how God's plan was to be, that He would send a Redeemer, and this Redeemer could only be His Own Son. So, then, that was God's promise, all the way from the garden of Eden, that Jesus would be here. Here He was as a Man, born of a virgin, but it taken the Spirit of God to quicken that Word to Him. And He was the Word, quickened, the Word quickened for that hour. The time had come when you had to have a Redeemer. The law had failed. Other things had failed. Now, it takes a Redeemer, and He was the promised Redeemer. He was quickened by the Word of God. [Romans 8:28-30]\n\nL-56 And now if that same Spirit that was upon Him to be the Redeemer in that age, that we have accepted now the promise of in this last days, what would take place; if you become part of that Word, you are redeemed with Him, because the same Spirit that dwelt in Christ is dwelling in you, quickening your life to this age. And It'll also, in the end time, quicken your mortal bodies, resurrect them, bring them up again. That takes the gloom away when we look at it, in that. And that's the Truth. See? [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-57 Romans here, Paul has proved it to us. See? \"If the Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, it will also quicken your mortal bodies.\" This is the same Spirit that raised Him up, that quickened the true believer to Eternal Life. The Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells into the believer, quickens the believer to Eternal Life. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-58 There's only one Life, one Eternal Spirit, one Eternal Life, and that's God. God, alone, is the Eternal. And then we, being His children, are part of Him, that is, the attributes of His thinking. And the thought is expressed and becomes a word. Then, each individual in here, that possesses this Eternal Life, was before the foundation of the world, in God's thinking. It's the only way it could be, 'cause you're a attribute. That's an expression of a thought, has become a Word; and a Word has taken Life, and it's Eternal. That's the reason we have Eternal Life. In the same principle that the great Son of God, the Redeemer; we become sons and daughters of God, through that same Spirit, by the same foreknowledge of God. [John 10:27-28], [Romans 6:23]\n\nL-59 Look at the millions on earth that didn't receive It when Jesus was here. But how thankful that we should be this morning, to know that we have the direct evidence and the Bible proofs, that we are included in that great resurrection morning coming, that great Easter. We have the earnest of it, right now in our mortal bodies. The predestinated ones are the first, of course, to be quickened, when the Holy Spirit comes to claim Its own. [Romans 8:29]\n\nL-60 Now, there's a great statement, and I want my minister brothers to try to understand this. See? In the beginning, God, the great Spirit, He wasn't even \"God\" then. He was the Eternal One. God is an \"object of worship.\" He had nothing to worship Him. There was no--there was no Angels, no nothing. Just God alone, Him alone, is Eternal. But, in order to be God, there had to be something to worship Him, so He created Angels, and Beings, and Cherubims, and so forth, to worship Him. His great plan begin to unfold. [Genesis 1:1-5]\n\nL-61 But remember, you, in the--the statue that you are in, this morning, if you wasn't in His thinking then, you're not now. For you, there's some part that's in you, that's Eternal, and Eternal only belongs to God. And in God was His thinking of you setting right where you are now. In His thinking, I stood at the pulpit this morning, because He's infinite and knows all things. Therefore He could tell the end from the beginning, because He is Eternal. And you, being a son of God or a daughter of God, then you were in His thinking at the beginning. [John 6:37], [Ephesians 1:4]\n\nL-62 And then when the Holy Spirit come, and you're on earth, walking around here as a sinner, way down in your life there is something. You don't know what's taking place, but you're hungry. I heard the Presbyterian brother; I heard the--the Baptist talking about, back there, he was a--a Freewill Baptist, preaching where he can. My fellow brother, that you, there's something in you, something that you never put in there. It's something that you couldn't desire to be in there. It's something that's contrary to your own nature. It's the foreknowledge of God, taking place, God's Word. [Matthew 5:6], [I Peter 1:2] 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min\n\nL-63 And Jesus was born the Son of God, to be Emmanuel, God's full expression in a Man. And He found Him in perfect obedience, down at the River of Jordan, being baptized by that prophet. And as soon as He obeyed Him, and walked out of the water, the Heavens opened to John. And he saw the Holy Ghost descending from Heaven, saying, \"This is My beloved Son.\" See? Perfect obedience, the Spirit had sought Him out, in obedience. [Matthew 3:13, 16-17], [Matthew 1:23]\n\nL-64 Oh, wayward man or woman, this morning, when you're setting here, and there's something in you telling you This is right, it's the Holy Spirit seeking you out, to bring you to a knowledge of Truth of this hour that we're now living, not some hour that's gone by, the hour now. [John 8:32]\n\nL-65 There was thousands there that had obeying an hour passed. But there was a present-tense hour, that was the hour that Jesus was to appear, and there stood the Word. There stood the people. And here was the manifestation of God taking place, to vindicate that that was the Truth.\n\nL-66 And as pentecostal people, today, let me say this, that we're standing in this last days where God promised He'd pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, and His sons and daughters should prophesy. For He said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\" It's the hour. That's what makes that creation in you. [Acts 2:17], [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-67 As I spoke here, not long ago, it sounded a little sacrilegious; but I hope it don't, to you, this morning. The farmer that set the eagle, or set the hen, and had an eagle egg. Many of you remembers the story of the old eagle giving birth to--to this... Or, the hen giving birth over here to this chicken, or--or--or an egg of an eagle under her chicken feathers. See? It's the atmosphere.\n\nL-68 The Presbyterian church, Methodist church, Baptist church, any of them can bring forth these eagles. Sure. It's the atmosphere that does it. As Dr. Bosworth used to say, \"You could take a hen egg and put it over, under a pup, and tie him down, a pup would hatch out a chicken.\" Why? It's the atmosphere. And when any church or any group that'll assemble themselves together, and pray until they throw away their creeds and things, and look straight in the face of God, it'll bring forth eagles just as certain as I'm standing here.\n\nL-69 That's what I think that this businessmen's group has done, trying to break up the atmosphere. We're getting too clannish. One belongs to this and that. Let's break up the atmosphere and get the atmosphere in a Heavenly worship. Get the atmosphere right, eagles will be born, and--and out of any church, anywhere.\n\nL-70 And this little eagle walked with the hen for a long time, but the--the clucking was kind of strange. He didn't understand what the hen meant when she scratched in the--the--the waste of the manure piles in--in the yards. And that wasn't food, to him. And she eat bugs, and so forth, that an eagle doesn't eat. So it seemed strange, all, to him. And he was an ugly duckling, he was. Not saying this sacrilegious. Maybe he was a Freewill Baptist, and, but something on that order, or a Presbyterian.\n\nL-71 But, you know, one day his mother knew that she had laid an egg. There had to be a child somewhere. So she throwed her big wings into the winds, and she searched and she searched, screaming to the top of her voice. And one day, she passed over the barnyard. And when this little eagle heard this familiar scream, he had never heard it before, but he realized that it fit him like a glove over a hand. And he knew that was his mother. She knew that was her son. She was looking for him.\n\nL-72 So has God, in every age, ordained His Church for that age, a Message for that age. And they could have laws and anything that they want to. But when that hour comes, the Holy Spirit of God, which was at the beginning thought out and spoke out for that age, that Spirit hunts that egg. And when he hears that Message, there is no church denomination going to hold it. It'll rise to the heights. It's got to. It's a different bird. It's a different creature. He's an eagle, and he'll hear the scream. \"My sheep hear My Voice.\" As someone said, Brother Williams, \"Sheep Food.\" [John 10:4-5, 27]\n\nL-73 \"My sheep hear My Voice. A stranger they will not follow.\" No matter how loyal the church has been, and how much its big of name it's got. \"When My sheep hear My Voice,\" which is the Word, \"a stranger they will not follow.\" They'll go right straight to that Word, and can do it. It's like a--a--a magnet. [John 10:4-5, 27] 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min\n\nL-74 One day, up in Indiana, I was visiting them steel mills, and the whistle blowed. And everybody took off their aprons, and begin to sweep the... out from their lathes, out into the middle the floor, the shavings that they had made through the day. And I was walking along with the man that was taking me through, and he said, \"Watch this.\" And so every man laid his--his bench dress up on the--up on the table, walked away.\n\nL-75 Way back in the back, he touched a little button. And here come a big magnet through, and it picked up every bit of that iron that was shaved off of those pieces, now, and went out. It demagnetized it; it dropped into a cupola. And was melted over, for another piece of--of goods, the same thing, axles or whatever they were building.\n\nL-76 And I stood there and looked at that, till I--I just lost myself. And I said, \"I'm wondering something.\" He said, \"What is it, sir?\" And I said, \"I notice that some of that didn't go up.\"\n\nL-77 He said, \"It's aluminum, and the magnet is not magnetized to the aluminum.\" I said, \"I see.\" And he said... Then I said, \"Well, you notice, there is a piece of iron laying across.\" \"But, you see, sir, it was bolted down.\" I said, \"I see.\" And when he took it out, I said, \"Now what happens, that out there?\" Says, \"It goes right back into the mill, poured out through the cupola, and comes right back and makes another wheel.\" I said, \"Praise the Lord!\" That's it. See?\n\nL-78 There is a great magnet setting in the sky, that God one day will touch His fingers to. No man knows the time He's Coming, not even the Angels of Heaven, doesn't know. God alone knows. But there has been some trimmings that's come off of the Bible, Bible Christians, believers for this hour. One of them might have been an axle back in another day. This might be some other part. It's going on to make the big regime of God. But it'll be molded into the pot of God's great cupola, and poured out again into the images of God. And just those who are magnetized to it will be taken up. Oh, how to... What a privilege it is, to know that there is something in the resurrection that's pertaining to us! [Matthew 24:36], [Romans 8:29]\n\nL-79 Now, notice, recognize the call of God's Word, which is a part of. And it's an eagle to an eagle. Now, if that mother would have screamed like a--a buzzard, he'd have never knowed it. He'd been just as well off in the barnyard. But it was the scream of an eagle. There was something inside that little fellow, that he knowed he was an eagle. [John 10:24-29]\n\nL-80 And the same thing is with every true believer. When the preaching of God's Word comes forth, and is vindicated and proved that it's God's Word for this hour, then there's Something within the believer. I don't care how loyal his father was to a church, or how loyal his mother was, or his grandparents, and if the church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Message. There's something in him that screams out. He'll leave the barnyard. He's got to do it. The chicken might have been all right one day, but this is eagle hour. See? It--it's a different. There is something, that, he must leave the old coop and fly away into the blue. Then this earthly body is quickened and brought, by the quickening Spirit, to the obedience of God's Word. [John 6:63]\n\nL-81 Now, when this Holy Spirit, represented as the eagle flying over the land, and finds the believer. \"No man can come to Me, no man can come to Me as he wants to. All the Father has given Me will come to Me, but no man can come by himself.\" It isn't your own thinking, your own drawing. It's God, drawing. See? \"All the Father has given Me will come to Me.\" [John 17:9], [John 6:44], [John 6:37, 65]\n\nL-82 Now, the Holy Spirit is here on earth, looking out those individuals that God has ordained to Life in this age. And as soon as It finds it, It does just like It did on Jesus Christ, the great super Son of God Who redeemed us all. It comes down and takes Its place of abode into the human life, now, notice, brought the quickening power. Now, that quickening power that come upon Jesus quickened Him to manifest every promise of the Word of that day. So does the Holy Spirit that come upon us in this day, if it's not a mockery holy spirit, you're not the Devil mocking the Holy Spirit, but is the real, true Holy Spirit. It'll manifest the promise of this hour. [Acts 13:48], [Ephesians 2:1-2], [Colossians 2:13], [Romans 8:10-15] 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min\n\nL-83 When It fell upon Luther, It manifested that promise of that hour. When It fell upon Wesley, It manifested the promise of that hour. When It falls in this day, It manifests the promise of this hour. When It fell upon Moses, It manifested the promise of that hour. Fell upon Noah, It manifest the promise of that hour. When It fell upon Jesus, It manifest the promise of that hour. See? [Colossians 1:26]\n\nL-84 It's the Holy Spirit coming down, to quicken, make alive those people that's foreordained of God to be in the Rapture. Notice. That is, if he is a true eagle, he will understand the Message of the hour if he's a true eagle. Now, the little eagle probably, in the barnyard, was eating all right, but he--he knowed it wasn't just exactly right. But then when he heard the Truth, then he received this Truth. Now, in John 14... [Romans 8:11], [I Peter 1:20]\n\nL-85 John 5:24, rather, Jesus said, speaking this way, \"He that heareth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting Life, and shall not come into the judgment, but is passed from death unto Life.\" Just think how simple that is, \"He that believeth.\" Now, the correct way of saying that, \"He that understandeth.\" [John 5:24]\n\nL-86 Now, you go out here on the street and say to this prostitute, \"You believe?\" \"Sure.\" \"You believe He's Son of God?\" \"Certainly.\" \"Been baptized?\" \"Sure.\"\n\nL-87 Go down to the drunkard, say, \"You hear That? Hear that preacher preach?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You believe That?\" \"Sure.\" See?\n\nL-88 But, \"He that understandeth, he that knoweth his place in this hour, he that heareth My Word and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath\" (present tense) \"Eternal Life. Shall not come into the Judgment, but has already passed from death unto Life.\" Then when this new Eternal Life dwells in you, It is the potential, or the earnestness of you being quickened from mortal to immortality. [John 5:24]\n\nL-89 Let me say that again. When This Spirit has found you, the individual, and has come upon you, It is the potential of your Eternal inheritance that God thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world. That is your potential. [Matthew 25:34], [Ephesians 1:4-5]\n\nL-90 Like if you asked me for an oak tree, and I give you an acorn. Now, the--the--the life for the oak tree is in the acorn now, but you have to wait till it grows up.\n\nL-91 So do we. When you receive the Holy Spirit of God, It's God's potential waiting upon you, that's already recognized you. And you're sealed by the Spirit of promise, of God, into the Body of Christ. When God looked down at Calvary and seen Jesus dying, He not... Oh! He died for His Bride, the Body, which is the Word Church, the Church that believes the Word of God for the age, whether it's feet, body, head, or wherever it is. See? It's... Christ was bleeding and dying. And God, looking upon Him, saw His resurrection, and the Church raised with Him on Easter. [Romans 14:9], [I Thessalonians 4:14]\n\nL-92 Now, I want you to get all this together, 'cause I got something here in a little bit, I want to say, the Lord willing.\n\nL-93 Now notice. It's the earnest, or the potential, the quickening power of your resurrection, when you receive the Holy Spirit. Is then dwelling in you, the potential of it. [Ephesians 1:10-14]\n\nL-94 Notice, you--you are now on your way, growing to the full resurrection. No tree just comes up overnight. It's got to grow, as we grow in the grace and knowledge of God. You are baptized into the Holy Spirit. Now, as the pentecostal Church, baptized into the Holy Spirit, It's begin growing. Limbs has died. They was pruning them off. But the Tree is still growing, is still going on, because It's got to come to the resurrection. [II Peter 3:18]\n\nL-95 They're led by the Spirit, to quicken the Word to you who is believers. The Word keeps quickening, as you come 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min to first limb, second limb, third limb, on up. It just keeps quickening. The Spirit of God keeps quickening to you.\n\nL-96 Notice that, Pentecost, their bodies were quickened by the new Life they received. That makes me feel religious. Think. Now, here was men, fishermen, tax collectors, the humble little women of... and just ordinary housewives, little virgin girls. They were believers. They were believing that this was the Truth. They believed that, when Jesus died. They believed on Him. And rose up again, from the dead; they believed that to be the absolutely testimony of God, that He had quickened Him to life.\n\nL-97 Now, they go up, to the Day of Pentecost, to receive their abstract. Do you know what an abstract is? Is when a deed has been cleared. They went up there to receive their abstract. And they become quickened, or what a thrill! They had bought the land; been bought for them. They had received it. [John 6:63]\n\nL-98 Is it true or not? \"We seen Him raise up, but now what about us? We are witnesses. We stood and seen the Man crucified. We seen the clouds come over the earth and darken the skies. And the--the earth quaked and shook; it had nervous prostration. Then when... They put Him in the grave. They speared Him in the heart, with the spear, and they took His body down and laid it in the grave of Joseph Arimathaea. [Matthew 27:35, 54], [John 19:34], [Luke 23:50-52], [Matthew 27:57-60]\n\nL-99 And then they find out, that, on the third day, He raised up again. And as the disciple said, \"We are witnesses of this. We seen Him raise up. We know He's alive.\" [Matthew 17:23], [Luke 24:6], [Mark 16:6]\n\nL-100 Now what did that do? That took all the fear out. No wonder Jesus said, \"Fear not. I'm He that was dead, and is alive forevermore.\" See? It taken all the fear out, when they did that. [Revelation 1:17-18], [Acts 2:1-4]\n\nL-101 Now, but when they went up to Pentecost, there they received the quickening power, the power that made them alive.\n\nL-102 Now there's where I think that, you Presbyterian and Methodist brethren, you do receive potentially on believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, but the abstract hasn't come yet. That's the clearing of the deed.\n\nL-103 God gave Abraham a promise. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness. But He sealed the covenant by the seal of circumcision. [Romans 4:11]\n\nL-104 And God gives you a promise, potentially, that you will receive it, and you're going to be raised up, this body is going to be glorified with Him at the end time. But, you see, you have to get a clearance on that deed. And the clearance is when everything against it has been stricken off, and you got the abstract to it. You've got the seal. It's yours. Everything is on it belongs to you. Amen.\n\nL-105 And when we believe on Jesus Christ for our Saviour, and repent and are baptized, and come up to believe Him; God recognizes our repentance and our faith towards Him, and sends down the abstract. And the abstract is the assurance. It's the guarantee that, everything was ever held against you, you thoroughly repented. Hallelujah! And the property is boughten, and you hold the abstract for the assurance. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-106 Let somebody try to put you off the land, say he belongs, and you with the abstract in your hand. Let him try to do it. There ain't a law in the land can do it, because you hold the abstract.\n\nL-107 And there's no devil, no church, or any theology, that can overstep the boundaries of God's proof and abstract, that the baptism of the Holy Ghost has recognized us in Jesus Christ. We're just as sure to raise as He raised, because potentially we have already raised in Him. Amen.\n\nL-108 The old things. What does it do to our mortal bodies? It turns our opinion, changes our notions. It sets our affections on things which are Above. And the smoking, drinking, gambling, the things that you used to do, is dead. It's beneath you. [Colossians 3:2]\n\nL-109 And you are quickened. And this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition, already. Notice the pentecostal people up there, when they got quickened by the Holy Spirit. Listen to me. When those pentecostal group up there, on the Day of Pentecost, received their abstract deed from God, sure, it glorified their souls. They screamed. They saw tongues of Fire separated upon each of them. And it so quickened their body, till they couldn't 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min even speak in an earthly language anymore. It quickened their body to a Heavenly language, the Place they're going to. Quickening power of God shook their mortal bodies so, till their entire mortal language was transfigured, transformed into an immortal language. What a quickening power! What? Something that belongs. [Acts 2:3]\n\nL-110 \"If the Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwells in your mortal bodies, It shall also quicken your mortal bodies.\" We are quickened then by the power of the living God. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-111 Tongues, quickened to a new Heavenly language, to speak to them; a rapturing up, raising up into a different atmosphere than what they had ever lived in. Also, with the new quickening Life to them, that come in them, It quickened their language. They spoke in new tongues. Oh, yes!\n\nL-112 Now watch them. It also was designed to give them, after this abstract, it was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds. Every promise on the grounds of God's Word, that was promised in the Bible, that quickening power was give to them, to quicken that promise to them. Therefore, they laid hands on the sick, they was healed. They spoke in new tongues. They done great signs and wonders, because that was in God's promise. And when Jesus died, to redeem that back to them, the grounds that belonged to sons of God, He demonstrated what God was. [Mark 16:17], [Acts 10:46], [Hebrews 2:4]\n\nL-113 How dare we to socialize that and put it into an organization? We have no rights to do that.\n\nL-114 It's the Holy Spirit, today, hunting out honest hearts that will believe that Message. Everything in the Bible, that was promised, is to that believer. And when you accept it in its fulness, and God knows that you'll do it, He gives you the abstract to that. And then every promise that's made is in your possession, and the Holy Spirit is there to quicken that to you. Oh, my! What--what kind of people should we be? How wonderful to see the God's great Holy Spirit here to do that power! Think of it. When, the Holy Ghost Itself, here to bear record of this hour. Jesus said so. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. How dare any man to wipe that out of There? [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-115 \"The works that I do shall you do also,\" John 14:12. \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\" That is the assurance. When we see a group of people setting together, and those signs manifesting themselves, that's the assurance that the abstract is there to vindicate that that's property of God. Amen. [John 14:12], [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-116 So, we are Easter, also. Amen. We are now in our Easter. We've already raised, hallelujah, from the things of the world, to the things of God's promise. Not we will; we are. It's the potentials.\n\nL-117 It's God's promise. He'd pour out His Spirit in the last days, and that's what they would do. Notice, laid their hands on the sick; everything that was in God's promise. \"I shall pour out My Spirit in the last days, upon all flesh. Your old men shall dream dreams. Your young men shall see visions.\" And all these different promises that He made, everything is laying right there in God's promise. Jesus redeemed it to us. And when we become... [Acts 2:17]\n\nL-118 Or, we, if we are ordained on that ground, if we are ordained to be on that ground; like the eagle walking in the chicken's nest. If you're ordained on that ground, the Holy Spirit is here to find you. And when It finds you, you recognize Its call. You know the hour you're living. You know that these things are supposed to happen. Quickly you're raptured up to meet It, and now you're setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Oh, what a promise! What a Heavenly Father, Who would give us these things! [Ephesians 1:3, 20], [Ephesians 2:6]\n\nL-119 The Spirit quickens their fellowship with God, so that they call the dead back to life, in that day. They laid their bodies upon the dead; they come to life. Listen closely. They done the same things that Jesus did because the same Spirit, was upon Him, was upon them. If one Spirit makes a man act this way, it makes the other one act that way. If one... [Acts 9:40, 41]\n\nL-120 How can This come upon, say he's got the Spirit of God, and deny the works of God? Cannot do it.\n\nL-121 Notice. God's Life, which is in the Greek called Zoe, moving through them and in them, quickened their minds to His Word. Now, let me say it real quietly now. The Spirit of God that moves among the people, quickens the mind of the person to the promise of God. See? It does it. Look. And I'm trying to show you the--the... and let you realize that 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min I'm speaking now of the Church, and also quickened to Life, in Him.\n\nL-122 Although, they only was His attributes, to begin with. But if God said, \"In this day,\" back in the beginning, \"John Doe will be My servant,\" millions of years ago. Now, John Doe is born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the world speaking lies, because he's a mortal. But, maybe, he gets a little religious feeling. He'll go join a church. Maybe he'll join Pentecostal church. Don't know. He might join anything. But let him get under the atmosphere of God, once. See? John Doe is bound to recognize Who his Father is, just as that eagle recognized who the mother was. It's got to realize it. See? Only, that John Doe is God's attribute that's become a word, spoken, and then the Holy Spirit seeks that word out. Here it is. He calls him, gives him everlasting Life, and brings him into the Presence of God, God's Word. [Psalms 51:5], [Psalms 58:3]\n\nL-123 Look. God had the same when He saw Jesus. It was the--it was the finished work that God finished with Jesus, when He said, \"It's finished.\" All the plan was finished. [John 19:30]\n\nL-124 And when the Spirit of God comes upon you, and you truly are one of God's attributes that He spoken of. Now, if you're not, you'll wonder and flusterate, and run here and there, and everything else, and never come to the knowledge of the Truth. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] If you are one of those, the old things pass away right quick, see, and you become new, and the plan of salvation is finished. You're ready to obey every Word that God ever spoke of you, see, for you to do. You're submissive to His Word. The contract, exactly, the abstract to the contract, the title deed belongs to you. The debts are all paid. It's all struck off, and as it was at the Day of Pentecost. [II Timothy 3:7]\n\nL-125 Now let us notice the quickening, this quickening Spirit on other people.\n\nL-126 Now, I told you I wouldn't speak very long, and I just got twenty minutes to keep my word, if I do that, notice, to keep in what time I said, about--about an hour. Notice now this quickening power. That only comes...\n\nL-127 Now, there's a lot of mockery of It. There is a lot of people that really think they got It, when they haven't. Lot of people do it because they have got some false impression of what they seen other Christians do. Satan can impersonate any of that. We know that. And as missionaries, you can see it impersonated: shouting, dancing, speaking in tongues, all these things. You can see it impersonated anywhere. Absolutely. Amongst heathens and people who deny there is such a thing as Jesus Christ being the Son of God. See? And they do all those things, themself.\n\nL-128 But the real, true quickening Spirit that comes to a believer, quickens him to God's Word, that's back to eagle Food again, right back to where he lives. \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" [Matthew 4:4]\n\nL-129 Let us now notice this quickening Spirit as It come upon other people, like It did on--on the Day of Pentecost.\n\nL-130 Let's notice Pentecost, how they acted, and see if they were quickened by this quickening power that we're talking about. On the Day of Pentecost, they were all waiting up there. In themselves, they were afraid. The Jews, just what they were going to do, so they got scared. But what happened? When this quickening power fell from Heaven, there was a bravery set upon them. There was something, an understanding, where they wasn't too sure of it a few hours before. They knowed He had--He had died. [Acts 2:1]\n\nL-131 They know He had risen. They had talked to Him on the way. \"But was that thing for them, or was it just for then, for Jesus Himself?\" [Luke 24:32]\n\nL-132 But here on the Day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit, the abstract fell upon the believers. That made them part of His resurrection, made him part of His fellowship. The Holy Spirit came and confirmed to them that they would be raised up, because they were potentially raised then, from cowards to brave men.\n\nL-133 They were--they were afraid of the very Word that they had thought. Don't let this pass over you. They were afraid. They knowed that He was that Word.\n\nL-134 Even the Jews had to admit it. Nicodemus said, \"Rabbi, we know that You're a teacher that come from God. No man could do the things you do except God be with Him. Now, we know that. We recognize that.\" [John 3:2] 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min\n\nL-135 So the disciples... Peter had even sworn in His Presence. All of them had forsaken Him at the crucifixion.\n\nL-136 But here they are now up in this upper room, in the Presence of God. Then, all of a sudden, here come this Holy Spirit down from Heaven, and It quickened them. And the quickening took place, they wasn't afraid to make a witness of the Message that they believed and knowed to be the Truth. Otherwise, they were afraid of It.\n\nL-137 How many Presbyterians, how many Methodists, how many Baptists, in the world today, how many Pentecostals, that knows the Truth and afraid to make a stand on the It? I'm persuaded to wonder, what was that fell on you? Are you a part of His resurrection? Would you dare scream off for some man's theory and idea? Or, have you got the real boldness and the--the real manhood it takes, to stand out and call right \"right,\" and wrong \"wrong\"? Are you a part of His resurrection, or are you a worshiper of a bunch of creeds? Are you a goer to church, do you have your name on there, and dead in sin and trespasses? He that believes not the full Word of God is a sinner.\n\nL-138 Those Pharisees believed in many things, to be the Truth. They said, \"We are God's children.\" And they were, until that Word was preached. But when that Word was preached and vindicated, then they become sinners, for rejecting the Thing that they knowed was right, and witnessed that. \"We know Thou art a teacher come from God, for no man could do the things that You do without God being with You.\" [Ephesians 2:1], [John 3:2]\n\nL-139 I wonder today, where we at? I ask you. Where is this resurrection finding us? Are you dare to step out? Are you dare to take God at His Word? If you're ordained to Life, you sure will do it. If you're an eagle, you can't help doing it, there is Something in you. Or, do you want just serve a creed somewhere, say, \"I go to church. I'm just as good as you are\"? See? If you hold no birthrights, you'll never see it, you can't see it. But if you do hold the possession of this birthright, you can't help from seeing it, because it's part of you and you're a part of it.\n\nL-140 How could I deny the mother that give me birth? How could I deny the father, that his own blood is in me? How could I deny Charles Branham from being my father? I could not do it. I'm willing to stand his reproach or anything else, because I am his son. Hallelujah!\n\nL-141 Then being a son of God, and He was the Word of God, how can I deny that Bible being Truth, that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday, today, and forever? And seeing the hour that we're living in, we need an Easter in the church. Resurrection! We need a resurrection, to power faith, men and women to stand out for that which is God's vindicated Word.\n\nL-142 Say, \"Well, we having our Youth for Christ.\" That's all right. \"Our church is having a meeting. We want so many members.\" Nothing against that. That's all right. But that's only the atmosphere. That might be an old hen's feathers. But if you'll get in the right atmosphere there, it'll hatch eagle if you're an eagle egg. And if you were foreordained of God to see it, you can't help from seeing it, you're coming forth in a resurrection. That's the way the Baptist was born, that's the way the Methodist was born, in a resurrection of that day, but they turned off to a hen instead of an eagle. [Romans 8:29]\n\nL-143 As I said not long ago, going down from Tucson. I watched a very strange thing. I seen a hawk setting on the wire down there. That hawk has long lost its identification. It used to be a bird next to the eagle. It could not follow the eagle; no, by no means. Nothing can follow an eagle. But he was a hawk.\n\nL-144 Christ is the Eagle, and the church should at least be a hawk. They can fly higher than any other rest the birds. But that hawk has become soft. It's lost its identification. He sets on the telephone wires and waits for some dead rabbit. He hops like a vulture, in the stead of flying like a hawk.\n\nL-145 Oh, my brother, sister, you Pentecostal people, which is my own dear people! The church is losing its identification. It's coming down and depending on some dead formal creed, instead of flying in the Heavenlies, yonder, for fresh manna.\n\nL-146 A hawk used to hunt his own manna, but today he takes what the automobiles run over and what the vultures eat. He hops like one. He looks like one. 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min\n\nL-147 We so adorned ourselves in the modern world, our women cutting their hair, and wearing shorts, our men with not enough backbone to stand in the pulpit and tell the truth. We've long got soft on the Word.\n\nL-148 O God, send the Holy Ghost and look out them eagles somewhere, that's ready to stand yonder, no matter what takes place, that'll soar into the unknown, not set on the telephone wires and look for some Sunday school literature to come in. Let me have the Word, and in the freshness of the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost. We need an Easter, a resurrection that's potentials. My friend, if you're satisfied with such a carrion of the world, there's something wrong.\n\nL-149 My sister, my brother, let me say to you, this, in godly fear, knowing that I may never live to see an Easter again. But there's one thing sure, when a genuine foreordained son of God, by the Word of God, hears that Voice of God, he'll rise and go to meet It. It's the potentials, that he's going to meet the real living Word. As He was, the Bride will meet the Groom. She's a part of His Body.\n\nL-150 Notice, long have we, we're losing our identifications. We come on Wednesday night, some of us. Others stay home to watch Who Loves Susie, televisions, all kinds of worldly things, all kinds of entertainments, to keep you away from church. Long have we lost it.\n\nL-151 Our seminaries, our schools, are putting out a bunch of rickies with a whole lot of theology, and--and entertainment and everything in the church, to take the place of the prayer meeting. We've took dress and try to fulfill what the modernist try to do, bring them in. You'll never win them by that. They got more of that than you have. You ain't got no business on your ground... on their ground. Let them come over on yours, where the real baptism is shining, where the real power of the resurrection. Don't try to build a church like theirs. Don't try to have a pastor like that. Don't try to do this other, or cooperate with the world. They shine with Hollywood.\n\nL-152 The real Gospel glows with power. Eagles hear that. They don't look for a shine. They look for a glow. Glowing with humility, glowing with love, glowing with power, that's what the real eagle hunts. You can't scratch in a barnyard and please him. He'll never be able to do it. You'll never tell it to him, because he don't believe it.\n\nL-153 Let that Voice scream from the Heaven, \"I am He that was dead, and alive again.\" Something takes place. \"I am the same yesterday, today, and forever. And it shall come to pass in the last days, I'll pour out of Myself upon all's flesh.\" Glory to God! \"I'll quicken your mortal language. I'll quicken your mortal tongues. I'll give you the evidence that I'm going to bring you in the resurrection with Me.\" Hungry-hearted eagles reach for that just as hard as they can. It's the Pearl of great price, that they sell everything else, to go buy. Amen. [Hebrews 13:8], [Revelation 1:18], [Acts 2:16-17]\n\nL-154 God help us, friend. Our churches are losing their identification.Let's quickly now go to some. [Acts 2:17]\n\nL-155 Watch the action of those disciples, a scared. They knowed Jesus was the Truth, but, you see, It was against the popular idea, the popular religion of the hour, the most strictest religion, Sar-... Pharisees, Sadducees, and so forth, their cults, clans, and denominations. They were--they were against That, \"Heresy.\" But Jesus was the identified Word.\n\nL-156 And Jesus is the Holy Ghost, in Spirit. \"A little while and the world seeth Me no more. You shall see Me,\" not the body; the Life that was in Him. God is upon the Church, to call sons like He did then, obedient. [John 14:19]\n\nL-157 \"I always do that which is pleasing to My Father. Which one of you can accuse Me of Sin?\" Other words, sin is \"unbelief.\" \"What has the Word said about Me, that I haven't done?\" There it is. \"Show Me what the Word said that I'd do, that I didn't do. Which one can accuse Me? Which one can lay your fingers on Me, and say that I haven't fulfilled My Father's Word?\" Oh, when the Pentecostal church gets to that spot! \"Who can accuse Me of unbelief?\"\n\nL-158 Oh, Christians, be identified not as a hawk, but an eagle. That hawk is soft, it'll come down. You never see an eagle doing that. He'll never do that. He hunts his own food, out of the blue. God's prepared him so he can see it. He gets fresh manna, not something that's dead.\n\nL-159 In the Hebrews, when they crossed through the wilderness, they eat, tried to eat dead manna. It had become stagnant. It had--it had wiggletails in it. You know what we mean. It's just contaminated, rotten. Maggots is in it. [John 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min 6:49, 58]\n\nL-160 Why would I eat a food that had been dead years ago? It might be in form and shape, but it isn't fresh. We got to get food every generation, new. So does the eagle look for that food, every generation, as we're in our journey. Notice.\n\nL-161 Now let's take some people again. Let's take some of the Old Testament prophets, see what they did.\n\nL-162 Let's look first at Stephens, how Stephens in the midst of that Sanhedrin Council. When that council brought him up there, that great assembly of believers there, or supposed to be believers, brought him up and tried to condemn him. \"Why,\" he said, \"you stiffnecks, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Ghost.\" That's that Eternal Life. \"As your fathers did it back yonder through the prophets, so are you doing it today.\" And they gnashed upon him with their teeth. They didn't want to hear that. He was against their creed. He was against their denomination. And they stoned the man to death. And he raised his hands up, looked towards Heaven, say, \"I see heavens open, and Jesus standing at the right side.\" Why? He had the resurrection, quickening power in him, that took him into the bosoms of Jesus. [Acts 7:51], [Acts 7:56, 59]\n\nL-163 Notice, quickly now. Look at Philip, down there in a great revival. Having a revival where it had been daresn't for any man, why, if he had got a big cooperation amongst the churches and everything down there. Was having a great revival. And the quickening power of God spoke to him, said, \"Stephen...\" May It said this, \"You're having a great revival, but I got one man I want you to talk to.\"\n\nL-164 And Stephen is obedient, no matter what it is, how much criticism. \"Oh, Stephen's, you can't leave.\" \"But, I can. God said so.\"\n\nL-165 And he went out into the desert, and out there he found this eunuch. And what happened? He said, \"Has... If thou believest with all thy heart, that Jesus is the Son of God, I'll baptize you.\" When he baptized him... [Acts 8:36-37]\n\nL-166 Look. He was quickened by this quickening power, to leave a revival of thousands of people, to go out into the desert, to one man. Oh, that would be against all reasons. See? \"Why, there's ten thousand wanting you here.\" But there's one wanting, out there. See? And the quickening power sent him to God's provided place. Hallelujah!\n\nL-167 Men and women, It'll make you stand to your feet. It'll make you do the things that God wants you to do. I don't care what somebody else says about it. The neighbor say, \"Oh, that person has lost their mind. Pray all night; they read the Bible.\" I don't care what they say. It's what God called you to do. That's right. \"Oh, they say we can't have these old fashion, Pentecostal revivals.\" Oh, yes, we can, too. You can have it in yourself. And you are the majority, in God, no matter what the rest of them think.\n\nL-168 Notice, after, in obedience. Listen close now. After obeying God, to His Word, when he fulfilled his mission, that quickening power that he received at Pentecost caught him away, quickened his body. Miles and miles away, he was taken in the Spirit, and was found over in another country somewhere. Quickening power of God! And if we be pentecostals, \"That same power that raised up Jesus from the dead, if It dwells in your mortal bodies.\" See? All right. Notice. [Acts 8:39-40]\n\nL-169 Let's take another man with this quickening power. There was a man way long ago, by the name of Enoch. When a new thing come along, when something come along and said, \"Well, now we have to go back to the old school, or this, that, or the other,\" Enoch walked with God. Whatever God said do, Enoch never missed one word. He walked with God. What was he? He was a son of God. He was an eagle that had been called to that day. [Genesis 5:24]\n\nL-170 And when come time, he was so full of that quickening power! Remember, he had walked five hundred years, or more, before God, and not one time had he missed His Word. Not one time did he misbehave himself. Not one time did he do but kept the testimony. Everything that God told him to do, he went and done it. No argument about it, he just went and done it. No matter what anybody else thought, he went and done it. Why? He was full of that quickening power. And when it come time for the old man to die, God just sent down the ladder and he walked up Home. He quickened him, and took his mortal body up in a rapture. Amen. That's that quickening power.\n\nL-171 Look at Elijah, after his work was finished on earth. He was so full of that quickening power, he condemned them 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min Jackie Kennedy haircuts in his day. He had told old Jezebel what he thought of her. He told them preachers and priests what was right and wrong, and they didn't believe him. But he condemned them painted-faced women and things, so bad. And he so full of that quickening power till nothing could harm him. God had fed him from the heavens, took him out and set him aside. He was so full of quickening power, come time to die, the Jordan opened up, and he just walked, sent down a chariot and took him up Home, so full of that quickening power. He become a true, genuine son of God. Yeah. [I Kings 17:6], [II Kings 2:8, 11],\n\nL-172 Notice, he had a successor, and his name was Elisha. And Elisha had a double portion, this quicken power. See? He had a double portion of it. Now, he preached for about eighty years, or he was about eighty years old. He took sick and died. Now, he didn't get to go Home like Elijah did. See? Both of them is represented there in the Church; some saints go, and some resting. But notice when Elijah was taken up in the rapture; then Elisha went to sleep, in God, full of quickening power. Look at his prophecy just before he died. See? [II Kings 2:9-10]\n\nL-173 Now, let me show you. I don't care if you're dead, or where you're at, that quickening power never leaves. Years and years after his death, his meat had rotted away, the skin worms had eat it up. But they were packing a dead man, one day, throwed him in on that bones, and there was so much quickening power there till the man come back to life again. Hallelujah! Raised him up from the dead, because that quickening power that was upon that saint of God, never left him, stayed right on those bones. [II Kings 13:21]\n\nL-174 Oh, remember, we are flesh of His flesh, bone of His bones, if we are His Bride. Death won't bother that quickening power at all. \"Though the skin worms destroys this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.\" Glory to God! What a... I don't know what I say. What a hope for an old man like me, knowing I see my end time right out yonder soon, as fifty-six years old. [Job 19:26]\n\nL-175 Since a little bitty boy, I've stood here. I'm trying to proclaim This. But I know, That in me, nothing good that I have, nothing I've done. But in me is that quickening power that quickened me one day from the things of the world, as a young man, unto Eternal Life. Oh, the things that's happened! I've seen visions, foretold things. He never let nothing fail yet. I've spoke in other tongues. I've prophesied. I've done those things by the Spirit of God that dwelt in me. That's quickening power. I know that some day...\n\nL-176 My Redeemer is living now. And some day when He comes, these bones shall rise again, to go to meet Him in the air. You may bury me in the sea, burn it up, wherever you want to. That quickening power is Eternal. Whew! I feel the Easter right now. Yes, sir. I've had it for years. It's in me.\n\nL-177 It's in you. If, you, the Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal bodies, It's quickened you from the things of the world, to the Word of God only. It's quickened you from this life to Life Eternal. You who were once dead in sin and trespasses has now been quickened together, to set in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus, feasting on Manna from Above, seeing the hand of God made manifested, prove the promise of this day. [Ephesians 2:1]\n\nL-178 \"As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man. They were eating, drinking, marrying, given in marrying. And as it was in the days of Lot, so will it be in the hours that the Son of man will be revealed on earth,\" not Son of God, no more. \"Son of man,\" come back as the prophetic Message for the last day when that eagle will be flying; not the lion; not the ox in the sacrifice age. See? [Luke 17:27, 29]\n\nL-179 Every time, a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world. When the lion raised up, the religious power, it went to meet the Roman power.\n\nL-180 And then when come the sacrifice hour, the ox went, because he's the sacrifice Beast of the Lord.\n\nL-181 Then come the reformers, down through the church ages, come the face of a man. And the reformers had been since Luther, Wesley, oh, Calvin, on down, down, pentecostal age.\n\nL-182 But in the last Message that went forth, there came a flying eagle. It's eagle time, reveal time, the Word of God made manifest, the Word of God proved. Oh, children, walk into this baptism of the Holy Spirit. Come in and believe It, with all your heart, God will fill you. [Matthew 24:28], [Colossians 1:26] 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min\n\nL-183 Looky here now. We find now, remember, \"We are flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone.\" As God raised His bones and flesh out of the grave, they cannot hide the man that has the potentials. Death cannot take him. Jesus said, \"All the Father has given Me will come to Me. I'll raise them up at the last day.\" Oh, my! Easter! Why, we're right in Easter. When He raised, we raised with Him. He sent the abstract back. We hold it, as the baptism of the Holy Ghost. \"He is alive forevermore; the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" Hebrews 13:8 proves that. He's the same. [John 6:37], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-184 His messianic, anointed ones believe that. What is the messiah? What is the messiah? Messiah is \"anointed One.\" And now if He was the Messiah, by being the anointed One for that day, to fulfill the Word of God, to be the Redeemer and the anointed One, and God raised up that body; His Bride is the anointed one for this day. It's already raised with Him in the resurrection, because, \"These two are one.\" Amen.\n\nL-185 I--I wish I could tell it the way I see it. I wish I had the education I could do it with. See? I--I hope you see it. I hope, God, the Holy Ghost comes down there and puts that in your heart, to see what I mean.\n\nL-186 The resurrection, we are now in the resurrection. We are setting with Him in the resurrection, but only those who have Life.\n\nL-187 Not those who do not have Life. They won't know It. They'll never know It. They'll go right on thinking they're getting the Holy Ghost, being saved, and the Rapture will done be over with and gone. Said, \"Elias has already come, and they did that way, and you knew it not.\" See?\n\nL-188 Notice. Death does not stop the quickening power of God. Notice. Death can't stop it.\n\nL-189 You say, \"Well, my mother was a Spirit-filled woman. My daddy, I never seen a man so full of the power as my daddy. But he died, Brother Branham.\" Sure. That didn't stop the quickening power.\n\nL-190 Moses had that quickening power. You believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] There never was a man like him on the earth, until Jesus. For he didn't only see visions, he talked face-to-face with God.\n\nL-191 Even a prophetess, Miriam, disputed his word one day. He said, \"Don't you fear God? Consider my servant, Moses. There's not nobody in the world like him, this hour. There's never been anybody like Moses. I speak to Moses. What did he ever say, that wasn't truth? See? I speak to Moses. Don't you fear God? Don't you say a word against him.\" And right then she was stricken with leprosy and--and was dying. She didn't live very long, afterwards. Moses prayed for her. [Numbers 12:1], [Numbers 12:6-8]\n\nL-192 And Moses climbed up on the mountain, at a hundred and twenty years of ministry, or eighty years of ministry; hundred and twenty years of life, climbed up on the mountains and died, and was buried in the valley. But that quickening power was on him. About eight hundred years later, here he is, standing on Mount Transfiguration. Amen. What was he? He was included in that resurrection. Sure, he was. He had the quickening power of God. Here he was, standing. [Matthew 17:1-3], [Mark 9:4]\n\nL-193 Look at Job, Abraham, Isaac, the saints on the day of the resurrection, that great morning that Job and all of them knew that would come. When, he said, \"I know my Redeemer liveth,\" hundreds and hundreds of years before Christ. It's, actually, Book of Job was wrote before Genesis, they claim, the oldest Book in the Bible. [Job 19:25-26]\n\nL-194 And in his trials, and like we go through now. And his wife, even, the closest thing to him on earth, said, \"Won't you curse God and die the death?\" [Job 2:9]\n\nL-195 He said, \"Thou speakest like a foolish woman. The Lord gave, the Lord taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord.\" [Job 2:10]\n\nL-196 And then when the Spirit of God come upon him, and he begin to prophesy, said, \"I know my Redeemer liveth, and at the last days He'll stand upon this earth. Though the skin worms destroys this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.\" And he made a place to bury himself. He said, \"We'll buy this ground.\" He bought there and buried hisself. [Job 19:25]\n\nL-197 Later on, come a man named Abraham. The church growing, coming on up. Abraham, well, now, he had the 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min potentials of God, too, everlasting Life, Eternal, because God called him. Now notice. When he died, or Sarah died, he bought a piece of ground in Palestine, near Job's grave, and buried Sarah. Abraham died and also was buried with Sarah. Abraham begot--begot Isaac. [Genesis 23:13, 19], [Genesis 25:10]\n\nL-198 And Isaac, when he died, he slept with Abraham, in the same parcel of ground. Now, when, Isaac begot Jacob.\n\nL-199 Jacob died, way down in Egypt. But being a prophet, now, with this potential, this quickening power, he said, \"Don't you bury me down here, Joseph. Come here, my prophet son. Put your hand upon this hip that God crippled. Swear to the God of Heaven you'll not bury me down here.\" What was in that man? Why wasn't Egypt just as good as any place? He was a prophet. He know where that resurrection was going to be. Wasn't going to be in Egypt; would be in Palestine. Said, \"Put your hands upon my crippled hip, and you swear by the God that I've served. You're my prophet son, that, you'll not bury my bones down here. Take me up yonder and bury me.\" [Genesis 47:29-30]\n\nL-200 Joseph, being a prophet, also, laid his hands upon his crippled daddy. Said, \"I swear by the God of Abraham, Isaac, of Jacob, I'll not bury you here.\" They took him and buried him in that land. Why? Why? [Genesis 47:31]\n\nL-201 When Joseph died, he said, \"Don't you bury me down here. Don't bury me down here.\" Why? God is God everywhere, but He has a plan. Joseph was a prophet. He said, \"Some day,\" listen, his words, \"the Lord God will re-vis-... will visit you, and will take you out of this land. And when you go, you take my bones.\" [Genesis 50:25]\n\nL-202 That quickening power was in them bones. Oh! \"If the Spirit of Him that raised up Christ from the dead, dwell in you, He'll also quicken your mortal bodies.\"\n\nL-203 \"Don't put my bones down here. Bury them up there with those of the promise.\"\n\nL-204 When Jesus come, here, I got a Scripture here, Matthew 27:51. When Jesus raised from the dead, Job seen that coming, said, \"I know my Redeemer liveth. The last days, He'll stand upon this earth. Though the skin worms has destroyed this body, yet in my flesh I'll see God. I seen Him.\" They knowed. That was a prophet. Abraham was a prophet. Isaac was a prophet. Jacob was a prophet. Joseph was a prophet. And they had the revelation of God, according to His Word. On that Easter morning, when that One came and redeemed all those who had believed on Him, they raised, too, according to the Bible. [Job 19:25-26], [Matthew 27:51]\n\nL-205 That quickening power come into the grave of Job, where there wasn't even a spoonful of the dust of his bones left. After all those hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of years, his bones had decayed. It--it went back, and turned back to the gases of the earth, and just a mere ash dust laid there. But, yet, when that quickening power, according to the Word of God, to the promise, hundreds and hundreds, yes, thousands of years later, when that quickening power was brought forth from the grave; Job, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, all of them, come out of the grave with Him.\n\nL-206 The Bible said so. Saint Matthew, the 27th chapter and the 51st verse, it said, \"Many of the saints that slept in the dust of the earth, resurrected and come out of the graves with Him, when He come up on Easter morning.\" Why? They had that potential. They had that quickening power, see, and raised up from the dead, and went with Him in the resurrection. Enjoyed the resurrection with Him, because they were full of that quickening power. They had that genuine Easter seal. \"Well,\" you say, \"I wish I lived back in the Old Testament.\" [Matthew 27:52]\n\nL-207 Wait a minute. In First Thessal-... Thessalonians, the 4th chapter, the 16th verse, I want you to read that. \"I would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning those that sleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again the third day,\" not make-belief, but we believe it, \"even so them that sleep in Him shall God bring with Him.\" [I Thessalonians 4:13-14]\n\nL-208 The New Testament saints with that quickening power, shall resurrect, also, at His second Coming; just as sure as the Old Testament saints with all that quickening power upon their bones, and translations and powers, and so forth, that showed of God. Them prophets who the Word of God came to, they resurrected with Him on that resurrection morning; and with the promise of God that every one that's in Christ Jesus will also come with Him in His resurrection, the quickening power of God upon the bones. [John 6:37], [I Thessalonians 4:15], [John 17:24] 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min\n\nL-209 No wonder, we lay hands on the sick. No wonder, we love one another. We are brothers and sisters. We shouldn't hate one another because we're corrected by the Word of God. We should love another, and have respects for one another. You know, if you don't, it won't help you. [Mark 16:18]\n\nL-210 There's a little fellow setting right here, that, under this church now. A few days ago... That man believes. Little old boy had a cancer on his ear, and he wouldn't say nothing about it. He was working up there at the house. I had been on a hunting trip with him, up there at the Moseley brothers, and Brother Dawson here. We was up here a hunting, Brother William's son. And I happened to look over on his ear. I seen his ear all swelled up. I said, \"What's the matter, Donavan, that ear?\"\n\nL-211 He said, \"Brother Branham, it's been on a long time. I don't know.\"\n\nL-212 I just--just caught him by the hand there. That was a big cancer on his ear. Never said one word; just held it, and thought, \"My brother!\" In a day or two after that, there wasn't even a scar left of it. It was his respect in the God of Heaven, by His quickening power, killed that cancer and spared the life of Donavan Weerts back there. That's right.\n\nL-213 What is these things? Look here, people here in Phoenix. Look at you people who has believed in this. Look at the people who has this, that lays their hands upon you. Watch what happens. It's quickening power. \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\" If they lay their hands on the sick, that quickening power, eagle to eagle, something is going to take place. Now, a eagle to a buzzard, won't work. Eagle to eagle, raises from the barnyard, to the Heavenlies. \"These signs shall follow them that believe,\" when they're both in beliefs. [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-214 See that same quickening power of God represented in these two prophets, Elijah and Elisha. Notice, same word; one of them is catch up, the other one is caught up. Catch up and caught up. See? He was caught up. We'll be catch up; catch up with them, meet them in the air. \"Be caught up to meet them in the air.\" [I Thessalonians 4:16-17]\n\nL-215 Notice, a bird has to have two wings, to balance hisself. That right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Elijah was the translating wing, Elijah. Elisha was a resurrection wing. See? Both of them, together, representing the saints that are living and the saints that are gone on.\n\nL-216 Remember, quickened to see the past, the curtains. How these people were quickened back there to look past the curtain and see down in this time; those prophets!\n\nL-217 Look at Paul, said in the last days how these people would be, act and call themselves Christians. He was a prophet, full of the quickening power, foresaw it come to pass. We believe that. Don't we? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] He received quickening power.\n\nL-218 Look at the quickening power today, foretelling things, without one event missing. Not one time does it fail. Quickening power; not the power of a man; the power of God. The power, the abstract of Easter, the resurrected Jesus that sent back the abstract, to guarantee us that we're already quickened with Him.\n\nL-219 Notice. You remember the little book, the Business Men here, Looking A Past The Curtain Of Time? I begin to get older, knowing my days are getting shorter. I get real...\n\nL-220 I play that little piece that them ladies sang a while ago. I've had it for about eighteen, twenty years now. I Want To Talk It Over, Lord. And get out there and go to praying, then that quickening power comes. I'm rest up. I looked up There. I say, \"Looky yonder.\"\n\nL-221 I remember that morning, being caught a past. And my wife, sitting back there, laying on the same bed with me that morning. I was raised up, and looked up. And there she is, asleep. I said, \"If I'm going to do anything for the Lord, you better hurry up, boy. You're past fifty.\" Then the Holy Spirit caught me away, and I looked over There. I seen those saints, just as certain I'm standing here by this desk, with this sacred Book laying here, and a minister of the Gospel.\n\nL-222 Have I ever told you anything in the Name of the Lord but what happened? Yeah. I want you tell me about it. Every time, has it been perfectly, at the platform? Every time, has it happened just like He said? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] This was THUS SAITH THE LORD. 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min\n\nL-223 I stood there, looked over that time. I seen tens of thousands times thousands coming, young men and women, run, throwing their arms around me, screaming. I look right back and see myself laying on the bed. \"O Lord, let me look a past the curtain of time.\"\n\nL-224 What is it? It's quickening power that will catch us away. That great quickening power. The quickening power come in this last days.\n\nL-225 That's what I'm in Arizona for, right now. There's many people sitting right here, stood right here at Phoenix, and heard me tell you from this very platform, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD.\" How many remembers it? \"Now go. Something is fixing to happen.\"\n\nL-226 I saw seven Angels come. Didn't Life magazine pack it, as the fog of It floated across here, twenty-seven miles high, and thirty miles across? Is not Fred Sothmann, these other, Gene Norman, them, setting back there? Stood right there when them seven Angels appeared right there on the hill. It shook the hills, for miles around, like that. There stood seven Angels. And throwed a sword in your hand, said, \"Go home and open these Seven Seals that are given.\" And here they are, the true mystery of marriage and divorce, and the serpent's seed, and all of these things that's been fussed about. It's THUS SAITH THE LORD.\n\nL-227 What is it? The quickening power coming to the Church, making Her ready, this hour that we're approaching. Quickening power! O God, help us to receive It. Help us to believe It. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-228 See, just depends on what attitude you take to It, whether It's going to do you any good, or not, though. See? You have to believe That. You don't believe It, It won't do you one bit of good.\n\nL-229 How old Samuel stood there before that people, and said, \"Have I ever told you anything in the Name of the Lord but what happened? Did I ever beg you for your money, to live on?\" \"No, but we want the king, anyhow.\"\n\nL-230 That's the way the church is today. They want their own ideas. They won't pay a bit attention to you. They walk right around. Well, it just goes to show, the quickening power is not there.\n\nL-231 \"Oh,\" you say, \"I spoke in tongues. I jumped and I shouted.\" That's all fine.\n\nL-232 But if that quickening power is there, you'll recognize. Like that little eagle; that's his mama. That's the Word. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD. That's what God promised. That's what was foretold. That's exactly what happened. We're beyond any shadow of doubt, potentially in the resurrection right now, the saints getting ready to be taken up in the air.\n\nL-233 So, Jesus, so full of this quickening power, said, \"If you can destroy this temple; that took you forty years, you thought, to build; I'll raise it up in three days.\" [John 2:19]\n\nL-234 Why? Why could Jesus say that? Want to ask you. Why could Jesus say a thing like that? He knew That He was. Amen. I wish I could make that stick. He knew Who He was. He knew that, every Word, God had wrote in there of Him, He had fulfilled it. He knew He was the One David spoke of.\n\nL-235 Do you know you're the ones the Bible speaks of? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Do you know your position is in Christ? If you're in Christ, you're a new creature. Do you know this Word is just like everyday living, to you? Why, sure. It's yours. You are an eagle. That's your Food.\n\nL-236 He knew that, by the power of God, He would do it, because it was prophesied He would do it. That's the reason He wasn't scared to say, \"Destroy this temple. I'll raise it up in three days, because David said, 'I'll not leave His soul in hell, neither will I suffer My Holy One to see corruption.'\" He knowed not one cell of his body would corrupt. And it corrupts in seventy-two hours. He said, \"Destroy this temple. I'll raise it up again, and in three days.\" Why? He was so full of that quickening power that quickened every Word. He looked back and seen every Word God wrote of Him, and prophet said He fulfilled it. He knowed that would be fulfilled, too. [John 2:19], [Acts 2:27, 31], [Psalms 16:10]\n\nL-237 Now, every Word that God said, has your spirit said \"amen\" to It, It's been fulfilled in your life, as a believer? 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min\n\nL-238 Do you hold back on something, say, \"Well, my church teaches different\"? Then be careful, hawk.\n\nL-239 Notice. Eagles believe. There no question, to them. They believe It. Notice.\n\nL-240 Now, He knew it would happen because the Word said It was. And every Word wrote of Him had to be fulfilled. He knew that It was written by the power of God, by the holy prophets that had prophesied that He would do so.\n\nL-241 And prophecy never fails. It cannot. The Word of God can't fail. And it is written in the... by the Spirit that... And now, also, the Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead, if It dwells in your being, your body, It will also quicken your mortal body. Then, shoot it, burn it, do anything you want to, make fun of it, tear it down, turn it down, do what you want to. God will raise it up, for He said He would. And every saint of God has that promise in him, knows that that's the Truth. So, fear not, brother, we already in the Easter. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-242 Look now at transfiguration, just before we close. Transfigure, transfiguration, we are all represented there in transfiguration. Look what we are seeing today. Notice just what we're seeing today, the quickening power of God. We was all there. There was the dead saints, represented in Moses; there was the resurrection; and Jesus Christ glorified. Elisha... Moses, Elijah, and Jesus, all standing on the mountain; the dead saints, the raptured saints; and Jesus glorified. Oh, my! [Matthew 17:2-3]\n\nL-243 Well, you say... I heard a guy say. They'll say, \"You people, why, if you had this kind of power, you ought to go out and tell people what you can do.\" Far be it from a real Christian, saying a thing like that. See? Surely, we don't claim no power. To...\n\nL-244 But we do one thing. When they looked around, with all this power upon them, \"They saw Jesus only.\" And the real, true believer don't care whether he's backing up a denomination, or nothing about it. He only wants one thing, for you to see that glorified Christ, makes any difference. A real, true Mount Transfiguration experience only glorifies Jesus Christ. It didn't glorify Moses, didn't glorify Elijah, didn't glorify themselves, didn't glorify nothing else, but they seen the glorified Christ. And any true believer, that's what's in his heart, to glorify Jesus Christ. That's what he's trying, get the people to see.\n\nL-245 Not say, \"Well, if you come join our groups, if you come do this or do that.\" Oh, don't do that. Don't do that.\n\nL-246 See God's Word, which is Christ, magnified; and fulfill the promise of this day, in this great hour of resurrection. Notice. And it gives them joy, to know that we are with Him, a flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bones. What a joy! That's the only thing that a real believer cares about.\n\nL-247 They don't care about a denomination. They don't care about an organization. They don't care about what the other women think. They don't care. Certainly not. They won't do these things that the... these other women do. They... These men won't do them things. They won't hang and baby around with some organization, keep from being putting out, and afraid they won't have a meal ticket. They don't care about them things. It's nonsense to them.\n\nL-248 There's only one heart's desire, that is, to see Jesus Christ glorified. Their conduct must be with God. It must absolutely, nothing else, but just the glory of Jesus Christ. And what is Jesus? The Word. That right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now, notice, and seeing His same vindicated method, proving His resurrection. Now what is it? Seeing your life, by His promised Word that He said, \"He's the same yesterday, today, and forever,\" proving that He's still alive. [John 1:1], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-249 I don't care if every door in the country is closed to me. That, I'm... As I said, I was fifty-six, other day. I could be snapped out. I'm at the heart attack age. I'm in all this other age, and everything else. Well, what difference? It didn't make any difference to me when I was a kid. It don't make any difference now, what hour my number is called, and my card out of the rack. I don't care if they ever knowed I ever lived on the earth. It don't make me no difference. They don't have to have no big monuments and big buildings to say that I was here on earth.\n\nL-250 Only one thing I want them to know, know that \"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" And in my heart I hold His abstract. And I know that some day... Although, I may be drowned in the sea. I may be killed in Africa. Don't know what will happen to me. But one thing I know, I hold the abstract. Hallelujah! Every door can be 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min closed. That don't make a bit of difference to me. I'm not trying to glorify some man or some organization, nor myself, or none of the groups, or nothing else. I want people to see Jesus Christ is raised from the dead, and His Spirit lives. \"He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\"\n\nL-251 No wonder, Jesus said, \"Fear not. I am He that was dead, but I'm alive forevermore.\" [Revelation 1:18]\n\nL-252 \"For now we are redeemed by Him, and are risen with Him, and are now (not will be) setting in Heavenly places in Him.\" Now, when we have this Spirit in us, the abstract, shows that all of the doubts has been stricken off. What? Christ lives. Not I live; not me. \"Christ lives in me.\" Not you live, but Christ lives in you. Because, His living Word lives in you, showing that all the accounts of all your Methodist, and Baptist, and Pentecostal ideas, everything else, was stricken off. And Jesus Christ... [Ephesians 2:6]\n\nL-253 Like on Mount Transfiguration, all the prophets and everything else is finished. All the days of the Lutheran, the Methodist, the Presbyterian, they're all right, but, \"This is My beloved Son. Hear ye Him,\" the Word of this hour, the hour of the Seals. When, all the mysteries back yonder, that's been hid all these years, them is that great pyramid of time was stricken off, the headstone, make it honed down so that the star of David will settle into Its place. And the great Church of the living God will be raised like the wings of an eagle, packed out yonder into Glory. Yes. [Matthew 17:5], [Mark 9:7], [Luke 9:35]\n\nL-254 In now, in now, in our bodies: with speaking with new tongues; with prophesying, and foreseeing; laying hands on the sick, and they recover; the world, dead, and all the things of the world. We've passed from death unto Life, and we now hold the power. Hallelujah! On that resurrection morning, When death's seals will be broken, We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) we shall rise. (Amen!) [Mark 16:17-18]\n\nL-255 There ain't enough devils in hell to keep us from doing it. We were foreordained of God for this hour. The Word of God manifests Itself right through us. And we live in the Presence of God, by the Word promise of God. Ain't a devil in hell can keep me from raising. Ain't a door he could shut in my face, at that morning. The seals have been broken. Hallelujah! [Colossians 1:26]\n\nL-256 I'm free. I'm an eagle. I'm no longer in a cage, but I'm free. I've raised from the dead, into the new Life of Jesus Christ. Not only me, but every man, women, boy or girl setting here, that's been filled into that Spirit of God, is a new creature in Christ. And you are a eagle. [II Corinthians 5:17]\n\nL-257 We are alive, today, and enjoy the resurrection forevermore. Because He lives, we are alive, also. And He's living us, making us alive. And the Spirit that raised Him from the dead, dwelling in our being, shall quicken our mortal bodies, at that great Eternal Easter. Glory to God! [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-258 Oh, take the world, take anything you want to, but give me Jesus. Amen. I love Him. He's all the world, to me.\n\nL-259 And because that you are a part of Him, I am a part of you, and you are a part of me. And, together, we're a part of Him.\n\nL-260 Oh, Christian, what an opportunity we have! We have opportunities that Saint Paul never dreamed of having. We have opportunities that Enoch, and Elijah, and all them never had, the opportunities we have now.\n\nL-261 And there's one little sheep out yonder somewhere, and He'll not be satisfied till that one comes in the fold. By the help of God, and by a vision, and THUS SAITH THE LORD, I'm returning across the sea. That last little sheep may be a black one down there, for all I know, where they don't even think they got a soul. But God knows different. I'm going to seek till the last day of my life, to find that one, wherever it is.\n\nL-262 I hope I never have offended any of my brethren by saying these strict things. I... Not as I don't want you to go to church. Sure, I want you go to church. You go to church wherever you're going. But just don't let that be your hope, say, \"Well, I belong to this, or I belong to that.\" Oh, brother, sister, belong to Christ. Go to church, but belong to Christ. Amen. 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min\n\nL-263 Let that--let that potential, if that isn't in you, quicken you right now to Life. Won't you just receive It now?\n\nL-264 This room is full of It. I feel It all over me. I know It's here, the power of God, the great Seer of visions, the great Foreteller that can tell the things and it never fails, the great One that can speak and no man can say it's \"no,\" a Man can open and no man can shut. He that was dead is now alive, and alive, today, here in Phoenix, walking amongst the new-born flowers.\n\nL-265 No wonder, on that Easter morning little tear drops of dew was laying on every lily's cheek and every rose. Why? It knowed it was brought up through the ground, and somewhere there's an Eternal flower blooming. It'll take its place some day. That's right.\n\nL-266 No wonder, joyful tears can run down our cheeks. No wonder, our hearts quiver and shake when we can feel that same transforming power coming into our lives and filling us, even for letting us speak in a language that comes from Heaven. [Mark 16:17], [Acts 2:4]\n\nL-267 We're so quickened up into His Presence there, prophesy, foresee, foretell, and everything hitting perfectly with the Word. If it's prophesying contrary to That, don't believe it. But if it's with the Word, It's already said, THUS SAITH THE LORD.\n\nL-268 \"Fear not. I am He that was dead, and alive forevermore.\" That is God's Easter seal that seals every letter of this Word into your heart. What is the seal? \"You are written epistles, read of all men.\" You know that. But when God has claimed you, He sealed you with the Easter seal, that you are risen with Christ, and you are a new creature. [Revelation 1:18]\n\nL-269 If you haven't been sealed this morning, do so while we bow our heads.\n\nL-270 [A brother begins speaking in another tongue. Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... Lord. You hear that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"]\n\nL-271 Think now, with your heads bowed. Romans 8:11, \"If so be that the Spirit that raised up Christ from the dead be in you, It will also quicken your mortal bodies.\" [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-272 What can we look forward to, people? What is there left? Look at Formosa and all the world. And atomic missiles and everything else just ready to strike the world, and just so nervous, and scared, and screaming. And these movie mimics is on, out there, just telling all kind of jokes, just like a little boy going through the graveyard, whistling at night, trying to make the people believe that everything is all right. Don't you be deceived. The Coming of the Lord is at hand. [James 5:8], [II Peter 3:12]\n\nL-273 You notice, the other day, a fisherman come up and told me, sitting down yonder in the bay, that, some kind of a rugged point or something another down here. And how, that, long before that earthquake shook over in Greece, all the fish that usually feeds about that time of morning, they didn't feed. What was it? They wasn't on the surface. The second time it happened, same thing took place. He knew right then something is going to happen. Them fish wasn't feeding at that time.\n\nL-274 And all the gulls and things that feed on the fish, they quit feeding. That early in the morning, that's when they feed. They just sit up on the bank, got away from the cliffs and things. For, just in a few minutes, the sea moss begin to boil up out of the earth, off the sea bed. See? Them fish knew it before it happened.\n\nL-275 Going into India, I read the paper, said, \"The earthquake must be over.\" For days, the little birds wouldn't come back to their nests in the rocks. The cattle wouldn't stand around the shelters under the... in the shade, in the heat of the day. The sheep stood right out in the middle field, leaned against one another. They wouldn't go up around them rocks, two or three days before the earthquake happened.\n\nL-276 Why? Them sheep knew it. They knew something was going to happen. Those birds knew something was going to happen. Those gulls knew something was going to happen. Those fish knew something was going to happen. It's the same God that led those animals into the ark.\n\nL-277 Can't you see, spirit-filled people, something is fixing to happen? Don't look for some great big universal 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min something, sweeping, nothing but the Coming of the Lord Jesus. Remember, just remember the Words and promise of the Lord.\n\nL-278 Won't you come on in right quick? Get away from them big walls. The resurrection is near at hand now. If there's someone here that don't know that they would go in that resurrection, and not sure that they've got that resurrection power resting in them!\n\nL-279 Though the skin worms destroy it, though an atomic bomb burst right in the middle of you, it'll never destroy that quickening, resurrection power. No, no. Sister, brother, your precious name is put on the Lamb's Book of Life up yonder. No man can rub it out. There isn't enough rubbing compounds, in the world, to rub your name from the Book There where His Blood has bought it. [Job 19:26], [Revelation 21:27]\n\nL-280 If you're not sure of that, don't--don't take a chance on it now. See? You might take a chance on running through a barricade somewhere and not get killed, but you're not going to run through this barricade. No, no. You're going to get it. You won't have to. There's a red light flashing now. Bypass, bypass your own ideas, bypass the things of the world.\n\nL-281 Come. Let's be resurrected together in this grand Easter time, the great celebration of the Easter. Can you celebrate it in your heart this week? If you can't, would you just raise your hand to God?\n\nL-282 Say, \"God, I'm not sure of it. I don't know whether I could just do all that or not. Will You help me? I'm going to raise my hand to You, Lord. Help me.\" God bless you. God bless you. That's good. \"I--I--I want You, Lord. Help me. I--I want--I want to be raised. I--I want to be. I want to have the potentials right now. I want to know it's right. I want to know that it's right, Lord. I know, can't make no mist-... Don't want no mistake then. It ain't going...\" It's going to be too late. Now is the day. My! Now is the day. Don't wait.\n\nL-283 Not long ago, I was preaching. There was an old colored man come back there at the back the building, met me. Said, says, \"Reverend, I wants to tell you. I says you is right.\" He said, \"I done told the Lord, a long time ago, I want my ticket in my hand that morning. I want to know that it's marked right.\" Said, \"It's going to be a lot of trouble down there at the river.\" He said, \"I--I--I'm coming down that river.\" He said, \"I--I don't want no trouble there. I want to get it all straightened up right here.\" That's right.\n\nL-284 Got your visa? If you haven't got your visa... You may have a passport, but, if you haven't got your visa, you can't enter the Land. You know that. Have you got your everything ready? If it isn't, right now is the time to do it.\n\nL-285 Fear not, if you're a little bit scared. Now, there's about maybe a hundred hands went up in here. So if you're just a little bit scared, now let's just settle it.\n\nL-286 Now, I know we have different ways. Some men say, \"Come up, let me shake your hand.\" Other say, \"Come up, kneel at the altar.\" Now, them is fine. I haven't got one word to say against it, at all, not a thing, anything that will save.\n\nL-287 But let me just tell you my way. \"As many as believed, as many...\" Coming to the altar won't make you believe. Shaking hands with the minister won't make you believe. But if you're called of God, and you're an eagle, to begin with, just a scream tells you. You'll believe. If you really believe it, I'm going to pray with you. [Acts 13:48], [John 11:26], [John 5:24]\n\nL-288 Could you imagine that little eagle stay in that barnyard any longer? No, no. Huh-uh. No. Don't stay here any longer, friend. Let's--let's Rapture now. The grace of God is here to do it.\n\nL-289 Heavenly Father, we realize that we're coming down towards the closing hour. We haven't too long to be here now. Not as our age, but at the time. We believe there's a many young person setting here, will be living when this happens. It may happen yet today. We don't know the minute or hour. But, Lord, You told us, \"When you see these things taking place,\" and they been taking place now for a long time. [Luke 21:28, 31]\n\nL-290 We know we're way over, according to the scientists. Six, seven years ago, we was three minutes to midnight. We don't know how much time that is, ticking on, but we know we're right there.\n\nL-291 O God, to have that assurance: to see that our heart punctuates every promise of God with \"amen,\" to see that the Spirit Itself, that's come into us, quickens our being. 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min\n\nL-292 God, let my brethren see that, this morning. Let my brethren see that, that that Spirit comes in and quickens to the Word. Let my sisters see the same thing, Lord. And then, if they see something that won't let them quicken to that Word, O God, may they get rid of it right quick. Grant it, Father. It's all in Your hands now. I know I've failed in many things, and continue to fail, but, Lord, I've done all I know how to do. Now it's in Your hands. They're Yours. In Jesus' Name, receive them, Father. [Psalms 119:50], [John 6:63]\n\nL-293 Now to you that's here and that's needy of healing for your body. How many believers are here? Raise your hand. \"I am a believer, as far as I know my heart.\" How many possess? You know, beyond a shadow of doubt, that in your heart, right now, you've been raised from the dead? You know? Oh, my! What could happen in a meeting like this then? I know I'm late, but what could happen right now? Just think of what could take place. The potentials is laying right in you. See? You, with your hand up, you've took like--like an oath, to God, that, \"I know that something has happened to me. I may not be right where I ought to be.\"\n\nL-294 Neither am I. No, sir. I'm a long ways from where I should be. But I know this one thing, I've passed from death to Life. I know something happened to me. Many... Not as an old man now, but many, many years ago, it happened. [I John 3:14], [John 5:24]\n\nL-295 And I know, that day when I walked into that hospital, when I had my great challenge. I seen my wife die; me calling for her life. \"And what have I done but stand on the street corner, preach, and pray for the sick?\" And then Satan said, \"Well, He won't answer your prayer.\"\n\nL-296 I seen her die, but I know that in her was that resurrection power. Them bones shall rise again.\n\nL-297 I seen my little baby lay there. And I lay my hand on, say, \"God, don't take it.\"\n\nL-298 Look like He pulled the curtain down, said, \"I won't even hear you no more.\"\n\nL-299 Satan said, \"There it is. Just one word...\" He knowed better than tell me there was no God, 'cause I knowed that. But he said He don't love me, He don't care for me. See? Every reason thing, said, \"You're just a young man, yet twenty years old. There lays your wife laying down here in a morgue. And here is your baby going there. And--and just... You said He was a great healer, and He's all this. And, look, what does He do? One word, He wouldn't even have to speak it, just look down there and say. Just nod His head, that's all would take place, and it'd be healed. But, you see, He don't love you. He don't care for you. Letting your baby die right there now, and even refuse to hear your prayer in this dark hour.\"\n\nL-300 Everything he said was absolutely the truth. \"So what have you done? Work all day long, till you couldn't hardly stand up. And then sit up all night, till twelve and one o'clock. Standing on the street corners, preaching. Making calls to hospital. Just come in and sit down, a chair, sit there and sleep an hour or two, and go back to work again. Next night, the same thing. And here you are, about twenty-one, twenty-two years old. Every friend, every young lady, every young man that you ever associated with, called you a crazy crank. What have you done? You made a fool out of yourself. Don't you see it?\" I was just about ready to agree with him.\n\nL-301 And Something down in me, that was that quickening power. I said \"The Lord gave, and the Lord taken away. Blessed be the Name of the Lord.\" When all my hopes give way, Then He's all my hope and stay. For on Christ, the... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed]... sinking sand. Oh, He shall come with triumph sound, Then may I then be in--in Him be found, Wrapped in the robes of His righteousness. [Job 1:21]\n\nL-302 Not in my own; I don't have any. Mine is filthy, dirty rags. I'd hate to try to go to Heaven on my preaching. Hate to try to go to Heaven on my visions. I'm going to Heaven because I hold His grace in my heart. His grace, that's why I'm going. That's how we go. 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min\n\nL-303 Oh, friend, you're a part of this Body. You are God's little children. Now, I'm saying this to build your hope. If you found...\n\nL-304 If I found favor with you, told you the Truth. And what I've told you, is--is the prophet said, of years gone by. Not making myself His prophet. No, sir. But I'm telling you the Truth. Has He ever said anything but what was right? I've knowed you now for some twenty-something years, here in Phoenix, since that song, I'd Like To Talk It Over With Him, over at Brother Outlaw's church, I believe it was, and Brother Garcia. Have I ever told you anything in the Name of the Lord but what happened?\n\nL-305 Remember, there's only one hope. Get this quickening power. It'll hold you. When everything else has give away, It'll hold you.\n\nL-306 Some of them said, \"Did you keep your religion, Brother Branham?\" I said, \"No. It kept me.\"\n\nL-307 It keeps me. No, I don't keep it. It ain't whether I hold on, or not. It's whether He held on, or not. He is what held on for me.\n\nL-308 He didn't have to. Angels was set in every tree, said, \"Just pull your fingers loose. Just point; you don't have to take it from the cross. Just point your finger, and watch what.\" See, that mocking bunch. But if He had did that, I couldn't have had this testimony today; you couldn't had it. But because He stayed to the cross, He held there, that's why I hold with Him. On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; All other grounds are sinking sands.\n\nL-309 Now, if you're sick, will you lay your hands on one and another. Let's pray. Just lay your hands on somebody by you. Regardless of what's wrong with you, have faith now. If I ever told you the Truth, I tell you now. See? Jesus said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\" And you're believers, you just raise your hands. Don't doubt. There's some poor suffering person that you got your hands on. Somebody has got their hands on you. [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-310 Remember that quickening power, that power that raised up Jesus from the grave. Now you have faith in what you got in your--in your own body. It's going to help that person that you got your hands on. \"If It indwells you, It'll also quicken your mortal bodies.\"\n\nL-311 Dear God, as I stand here this morning, nearing the noonday time, when it's about this hour the day when Jesus cried, \"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me? I thirst.\" No wonder, the prophet foresaw it, and said, \"All My bones, they stare at Me. They pierced My hands and My feet.\" \"But He was numbered with the transgressors. But He was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquity. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed.\" We claim that, this morning, God. We claim that. [Matthew 27:46], [Mark 15:34]\n\nL-312 In the morning of this resurrection, notice, this vindicated Truth that I've told, Lord, from Your Word, in the Presence of God. He is Judge, and we are witnesses that He's redeemed us. And in us lays, by the grace of God, that resurrecting power. And our friends are sick, the one that the hands is laid upon.\n\nL-313 O God, we challenge the Devil, in the midst of our faith this morning, with hands laid upon the people, and me with my hands stretched over the people. Let every disease, every affliction that tries to hold the people, in the presence of this vindicated Truth, come out. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may these people be made free today. That, the Bible, the Words of our God said, \"If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" And our hands has been up in the air, towards You, God. [Mark 16:18]\n\nL-314 As, every plant of the earth drinks at Your fountain. And as sure as that plant, that's germitized, drinks from Your fountain, it begins to build up. It begins to grow. The stalk of corn, the flower, whatever it is that's drinking in Your fountain, grows up towards You.\n\nL-315 And this morning, we've growed, inches, Lord. We can reach up higher. We're drinking at Your fountain. We are Your creatures, with the resurrection power within us, Lord. And we pray that You'll hear our prayer for our brothers 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min and sisters. And may every affliction, that's hindering these dear people here that possesses this power, Lord, turn them loose, so they can serve God. And it shall be well, Lord. In the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nL-316 You believe Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Leave a thing like this? How can you do it? You just have to, look like, just pull yourself away. Do you feel that way? [\"Amen.\"] I--I--I... It may just be me, that I'm... But I had a feeling, just a strange feeling when I come among the people, where you set together like this. I know, somewhere, invisible here; just like radio, television, whatever it is, passing through this room; Christ is in this room. Just think, our Redeemer! Tony, He's here. Amen.\n\nL-317 And who could be any happier than people who possess, with Bible evidence of every Word of God being made manifest, to see even to Angels and His Being, as they have through the--the ages! And hear the Words of the seers, predicted and it happened just exactly. And here we are at the eve of His Coming. Oh, what a wonderful time!\n\nL-318 We'll see Him. One of these days, He'll be here. Until He does come, will you pray for me? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] I've got dangerous perils in front of me. I know it. See? And I meet with heathens who would shoot you, same as taking a drink of water, and you're just paid for. You come on their ground, devils that'll challenge you on the Bible, just as easy. But I never seen a time but what our God won the victory. I go in His Name, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the hope of Eternal Life, the resurrection and the Life. \"He that liveth and believeth in Me, though he were dead yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die.\" I believe that to be God's Eternal Word. Do you believe the same? [\"Amen.\"] Will you pray for me? [\"Amen.\"] I'll pray for you. May God watch over us until we meet again. [John 11:25-26]\n\nL-319 Now let us stand up to our feet, just a moment. (Got anything you want to say?) Let us bow our heads.\n\nL-320 It just wouldn't be right for us not to sing this little song, would it? Remember our song, I Love Him, is that in every heart? Let's just sing it. Sister, dear, would you... I want to say, I appreciate your playing, too, sister. All right. I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree. Now we're going to change the song. My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary, Saviour divine; Now hear me while I pray, Oh, take all my guilt away, Oh, let me from this day Be wholly Thine!\n\nL-321 Doesn't that do something to you? How many likes that real heart... I--I--I like jubilee songs. Sure, I do. But when you're in a spirit of worship, don't you love those old sweet hymns? I believe the Holy Spirit moved upon Eddie Perronet and them that wrote those grand old songs. Don't you believe that? Fanny Crosby, when she wrote. Pass me not, my, O gentle Saviour, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by. Thou the Stream of all my comfort, More than life to me, Whom have I on earth beside Thee? Or whom in Heaven but Thee?\n\nL-322 Isn't that wonderful? That makes us want to sing I Love Him. Doesn't it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now, 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min while we sing this time, I Love Him, let's... We love one another. If we don't love one another, then we can't love Him. Now let's just shake one another's hand. Just stand, and just reach across the table somewhere, shake hands, one another. I... [Brother Branham turns from the microphone and speaks with someone--Ed.] And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree. Let us bow our head now.\n\nL-323 Going to ask Brother Williams, young Brother Williams, to come here just a moment. I'm going to ask him if he'll dismiss this audience in prayer.\n\nL-324 I love Brother Williams, a young Christian, that I think is truly a servant of Christ, his little family. I have a lot of fellowship with these. And those precious Moseley boys and all of them, we been together, and so many of my dear friends here in Phoenix, that I love with all my heart. I think, that morning in that vision, He said, \"All that you ever loved, and all that loves you, God has given you.\"\n\nL-325 Believe someone here repenting of their sin, down on the floor, a young lady crying. Let's just bow our heads a moment for her.\n\nL-326 Dear God, is that that little sheep that was left in Phoenix? I don't know, God. You know. But, some day, it will be. But, Father, this, no doubt, is one. So I pray that You'd help her, just now. Sweetly open up the gate, say, \"Come, child of Mine. Come in from the tired, weary road. You been stumbling out there in the dark. I come out, today, to get you. It's My Spirit that's speaking to you and bringing you into the fold now.\" Grant it, God. May this young woman... just at the crossroads of life here. \"He that will hear My Words, and believe on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life.\" Grant it, dear God, to this young Christian. \"He that will come to Me, I will in nowise cast out.\" While saints are standing over the young woman, praying. [John 5:24], [John 6:37]\n\nL-327 Remember, even Paul, who was stoned so bad that he was dying, and when the...?... saints stood over and prayed, life come back. Because, in them bodies of those saints was that quickening power that brought the spirit of life back to Saint Paul. God, it could certainly pray the prayer, of death out of... or the death out of the person, by the prayer of faith, to life. Grant it, dear God.\n\nL-328 Bless us now as we wait upon Thee. In Jesus Christ's Name, we pray.\n\nL-329 Now with your heads bowed, I'm going to ask Brother Williams. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

Dear Lord Jesus, we are assembled again in Your Name, with great expectation for the outpouring of the quickening Power of God to bring us into recognition of our position and place, and our responsibilities, as being a called people, separated from the world, dedicated to God. Grant, Lord, tonight, that the blessings of God will guide us and direct us in the things we do or say, that it might bring honor and glory to Your Name. Amen.\n\nL-2 I am happy to be back in the church tonight and to be with you dear people. And I know it's warm, but I just called my wife, I think it's ninety something there, ninety-five or ninety-six or something, and it's quite a bit warmer than it is here. So I'm getting used to the warm weather now. So, but I'm so glad to be here at the tabernacle at this wonderful Easter time.\n\nL-3 And I can't say that I'll apologize for that long, long Message this morning, but I... It was, I didn't want--want to wear out your patience and then come at it again tonight. But I--I wanted to--to get that Message to you, that you are a part of this resurrection. See? And don't worry about It, no more, see. Just rejoice over It! There is nothing, nowhere, can separate you from It; nothing; Eternally secured in the Kingdom of God. When God has stamped His Seal upon you, you're to the end of the destination. [Romans 8:35-39]\n\nL-4 When the government puts a seal upon a package, the railroad puts a seal on a door, that car cannot be tampered with until it reached its destination. When God puts His Seal upon a man. And the Seal is the Holy Spirit. When He seals a man like that, he is gone to his Eternal destination. Never no more can he ever, ever go back, anymore. Cause remember, Ephesians 4:30 says, \"Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed for all times.\" See, you are sealed forever. You are sealed, Eternally, into the Kingdom of God, by the Holy Spirit. Now think of that! [Ephesians 4:30]\n\nL-5 Then, you, the devil will punch at you, and he'll say everything to you, and accuse you, and--and try to make you think that you're not. But don't you listen to him.\n\nL-6 Now, you know you've passed from death unto Life. You know the things that you once loved, you don't love no more. You know that you have believed every Word of God. You've seen God working right among us, without... Infallible proofs that He is the great \"I AM.\" You've notice that ever what has been said in His Name, never has one thing been prophesied in His Name but what happened just exactly the way it did. Even to science, newspaper, picture, cameras, writers, everything else, has to recognize it. See, regardless of whether they want to or not, God makes them do it, anyhow, see, to make it known. [John 5:24]\n\nL-7 Now, being a little group. Remember, it's not a big group that He comes for. \"Fear not, little flock; it's your Father's good will...\" See? [Luke 12:32]\n\nL-8 I want to leave a word with you, shocking, just before we have a ordination of a minister. And this is very shocking, but just that you might know. Now, I ain't saying that this is exact to number, but I'd like to leave this with you.\n\nL-9 I don't know whether any peoples in here has ever seen hybreeding of cattle. Which, I don't believe in it, but I've watched it done. And I have seen them take the sperm of the male, just enough to be touched on a little metal, like a little toothpick, and lay it upon a piece of marble. And turn those glasses which magnify it, I don't know how many times, until that sperm... Where you could see nothing with the natural eye, any ordinary glass. But when it's magnified, hundred or hundred and fifty times, you can see in that one little drop, of sperm, maybe fifty to a hundred little germs a bouncing around. Also, in the female comes as many eggs, in--in the sperm. Now, when they are--are brought together, now, the first two that meets and connects...\n\nL-10 There is only one out of that million is going to live. Did you ever think of that? They are the same germ, and the same egg, both of them just alike, but there is only one going to live. And that's not determined which one beats there 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min first. Because, sometime the egg, way back in the back, and the germ might be up in the middle of the sperm, and they'll crawl over one another. It takes an Intelligence to know whether it's going to be boy or girl, red-headed, black-headed, or whatmore. It's the election of God. It can be nothing else. Election! [Romans 8:30]\n\nL-11 Even in the natural birth, is election, whether it's going to be boy or girl, or whatever it's going to be. And when that little germ wiggles into this little egg, and the little tails drop off, it starts the baby's spine of whatever it's after; animal, baby, or whatever it is. And the rest of those million germs... A million eggs, a million germs, and only one lives. All the same, but God chooses by election what's going to live, and the rest of them perish. One out of a million! [Romans 8:30]\n\nL-12 When Israel left Egypt, they all believed in one prophet's message. They seen the signs of God, by Moses. Every one of them saw them. And they each one come out of Egypt, and walked through the Red Sea, and was baptized unto Moses. Each one saw the power of God strike him, when he sang in the Spirit; and when Miriam beat the tambourine, run up-and-down the coast. Each one of them, every night, eat fresh, heavenly manna out of the skies. Each of those drank from that spiritual Rock that was smitten. And there was two million people left Egypt. How many made the promised land? Two. One out of a million! Where they all at? Jesus said they perished. \"Your fathers eat manna in the wilderness, for the space of thirty years, and I say unto you that they are all dead.\" [John 6:49], [Romans 8:30]\n\nL-13 Now there is about five hundred million Christians in the world tonight, counting Catholic, Protestant, and all. If Jesus should come in that Rapture, according to what I've just said, there would be five hundred missing in the world tonight, in the Rapture. And they probably is that every day, counting all the lands, that's never accounted for. So it could be at any time, see. [Matthew 22:1-20]\n\nL-14 Oh, Christians, let us buckle on the armor of God. Let us do all that we know how, to serve Him, love Him, and wait for that great time. [Ephesians 6:10-18]\n\nL-15 Now, there is not going to be a great millions and multitudes come out of a generation and march in. There--there can't be. Now, remember, each day ends a generation, each day. \"As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the coming of the Son of man, wherein eight souls was saved by water.\" But each day ends a forty-year period for somebody, for some. See? And each day, so many is sealed away in the Kingdom. One day, the last day will arrive. [Luke 17:24-27] Let us be sure now, while we are in our right mind. And in the church, and amongst the people, where the Holy Spirit so has identified Hisself with us, let's be sure that everything is all right, and stays all right, before Him. [I Peter 3:20]\n\nL-16 Don't you stop. Don't rest, day and night, until that quickening Power has brought you from the things of the world, into the Kingdom of God. And you that truly are brought into the Kingdom of God and quickened by the Spirit of God, how happy! With tears of joy we should be on our knees, day and night, thanking God for what He's done. [Ephesians 2:1-3], [Colossians 2:13], [I Peter 3:18]\n\nL-17 Tonight we have a little change in the service. We have a fine brother here, Brother Capps. He come to us from the Nazarene church. And I think that is right, Brother Capps? He is wishing tonight to be ordained by us, by laying on hands.\n\nL-18 We do not have papers to give out to anyone, yet we're recognized as... We could have papers, but we believe that a true, ordained minister, his papers is in Heaven. See? And he--he has the rights to preach the Bible as long as God identifies his life with the Bible. We believe that's his credentials.\n\nL-19 And, now, Brother Capps has been ordained officially in the--the Nazarene church, but tonight he wants the elders, and so forth, to lay hands upon him for ordination, to carry this Message. What a gallant thing!\n\nL-20 I have--I have heard the reports ever since I been in Tucson, and such wonderful reports, of Brother Capps here in his assistance to our gracious Brother Neville, who is holding the candle of Light just as gallantly as these two man can hold. We have laid hands on Brother Neville, but not upon Brother Capps. And I want those who are ministers, Brother Jackson and them, if they're here, and Brother Ruddell and the elders of the church here, if they'll come up here just for a few minutes now, and laying hands on Brother Capps. And the... 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min\n\nL-21 Now we find, in the Bible, that that's the way they did it, they lay hands upon them and set them apart then. And that's the way they did Timothy. Said, \"By this gift that was in thee, from the grandmother Lois...\" They had noticed it, that there was a gift in the man, had come to him by the presbyters, by laying on of hands. [II Timothy 1:5-6]\n\nL-22 Now, latter-day brethren, latter-day-rain brethren, got, though, that mixed up. They thought they gave him a gift, by doing that. No, the gift was already in him, and they just laid their hands upon him as a sanction that they believed that God had already put the gift in him. And they sanctioned it, by laying on of hands.\n\nL-23 And these men here in this church, that I believe that's possessed in their soul with His quickening Power; if you brothers will come up just now, Brother Ruddell and all the rest of you that's here in the church, and the elders and sister churches around, to lay hands upon Brother Capps, that he might be ordained by our sanction, before this audience, and sent out to preach the Gospel of the Lord Jesus, wherever God may call him. He becomes... He is already one of us, by Birth. He is one of us because he has believed the Message. He is one of us because that--that he stands for the Truth of the Word. And we want Brother Capps to be officially ordained, before you, by laying on of hands, that he is one of us. Okay, Brother Ruddell, Brother Capps, Brother Neville. Brother Junior Jackson, any of them other ministers here, I don't know just how many there is. I don't... I guess they got their own services tonight. So come right up here, Brother Capps. Now where is Brother Hunter and them from New York, I... Brother Anthony? I guess they have gone back. [Brother Neville says, \"There is Brother Anthony back there.\"--Ed.] Any of you others that's here, that's with us, why, we would be glad for you to come up here and stand with us now, as a recognition that we believe Brother Capps to be. How many of you here know Brother Capps, raise your hand. All right, put your hand down. How many believe he's a servant of God, raise your hands. [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] We love him, as our brother.\n\nL-24 Now this is not exactly a correct way of what we would call ordination, but I want this audience... I couldn't sing this song, but I want you to help me try it. That...\n\nL-25 One day a prophet went down to the altar, in the temple. And while he was there at the temple... He had been a good man, but he had just been laying upon the arms of Uzziah the king, and he was a--he was a good man. But yet, one day, at the temple, he saw something, when he fell into a vision, that he had never saw before. He saw Angels, with wings, flying back and forth, through the building, crying, \"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!\" Come on, brother. Yeah. See? \"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!\" Ben? [Isaiah 6:3]\n\nL-26 And when he did, the posts of the temple moved out. And he said, \"Woe is me! for I'm a man of unclean lips.\" In the Presence of God he recognized, that even though being a prophet, he had been wrong. He said, \"I'm a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among people with unclean lips.\" [Isaiah 6:4-5]\n\nL-27 And one of the Angels flew, and took a coal of Fire and touched his lips, and said, \"Prophesy, son of man!\" Would you give us a chord on that, sister, if you will. How many knows this song? Let's, one verse. All right. When the coal of Fire had touched the prophet, Making him as pure as pure can be, When the voice of God said, \"Who will go for us?\" Then he answered, \"Here am I, send me.\" [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... speak, my Lord, Speak, and I'll be quick to answer Thee; Speak, my Lord, speak, my Lord, Speak, and I will answer, \"Lord, send me.\" Millions now in sin and shame are dying; Listen to their sad and bitter cry; 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min Hasten, brother, hasten to their rescue; Quickly answer, \"Master, here am I.\" Speak, my Lord, speak, my Lord, Speak, and I'll be quick to answer Thee; Speak, my Lord, speak, my Lord, Speak, and I will answer, \"Lord, send me.\" Let the elders walk around now and lay hands upon Brother Capps. Let's all bow our heads. [Isaiah 6:6]\n\nL-28 Dear God, the temple posts has moved again, and as seeing the Spirit of the quickening Life working in our brother. I pray, God, as he feels this from Above, that says that he must go. We lay hands upon him, as Your elders, Lord, and give to him the right hand of fellowship; and lay our hands upon him, and pass the blessings of God upon him, that You'll anoint his lips, his thinking, his entire being. And may he take this Message of the Gospel to every crack and corner that You'll call him to. Grant it, Lord. We give You our brother, as a servant of Yours, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nL-29 \"Preach the Word,\" my young brother. \"Be in season, and out of season; reprove, rebuke, with all long-suffering and Doctrine.\" God bless you, brother. [II Timothy 4:2]\n\nL-30 [Brother Ben Bryant says, \"Brother Branham, would you lay hands on me? Would they lay hands on me? I'd like to be ordained.\"--Ed.] Have you... I didn't know you hadn't. Brother Ben, here, has come to us. I think he's been preaching for some time. Yet, he hasn't been officially (I thought he had; that's the reason I called him up) ordained, or hands laid on him here.\n\nL-31 Now, Brother Ben's wife is here somewhere, and she is a dear person. She was a woman preacher. And when she and our brother were married, and he brought her to the tabernacle, when she seen and heard the Word, yet a fine little lady with a fine personality, but when she seen that it was wrong for the women to do that, she laid aside; and it seemed to fall upon her husband. That's correctly. That's apostolic. That's the way it should be.\n\nL-32 Brother Ben takes the tapes, as I understand, with his wife. They go into the re-... out-of-way places, way back into the mountains, into the jungles, and they play these tapes and comment on the tapes. Many times they are run out, cast out, throwed out. We expect that. \"For all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions.\" [II Timothy 3:12]\n\nL-33 How many here knows Brother Ben? How many believes him to be God's servant, [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] worthy of this blessing that we'll ask of God for him? See, he is not a stranger. He has been with us for years and years. I know him as a man of humility. He is like me; he makes many mistakes. We all do that. What I like about Brother Ben, he is willing to crawl on his knees to make it right. And when he heard, the other day, on Marriage And Divorce, he and his wife was ready to separate, because that he loves her, and she loves him, but they want to cope with the Word of God. Whatever the Word said, that's what they wanted. I pray that God will bless Ben and his wife, to His service. Let's lay our hands upon our brother.\n\nL-34 Dear God, we lay our hands upon our Brother Ben, by a sign that we love him. And we believe, Lord, that he is willing to do a work for You, to be sent out with these tapes, to play them among some mountain people in the way away places where probably many of us would never get, but yet the Message must go to all the world. We pray that You will bless our brother, and give to him Your Spirit, and may It come upon him. And guide him, and direct him and his wife to those places where maybe that one soul is way out there, and the doors cannot close until that one sheep is brought in. Thou art not satisfied with ninety and nine. The... Every name that's on the Book must be brought in. Help them, Lord, as we lay hands upon him, as associating him with us as our brother. And our help and prayer for him, will go with him. And we pray that You'll bless him, Lord, wherever he goes. In Jesus' Name. Amen. Bless you, Brother Ben! The right hand of fellowship we give you, as minister brothers. God bless you, brother.\n\nL-35 [Brother Earl Martin says, \"Brother Branham, would you lay hands on me, ordain me to work as a pastor?\"--Ed.] John Martin...

He comes to us from a... I believe the, originally, from a Pentecostal group, and now I think he pastors and does a independent work.\n\nL-36 I've knowed Earl to be a real servant of Christ. I'll never forget one act, many has been, but one act with Earl. I remember one night they called him when I was in Dallas, Texas; or I--I believe, no, it was... [A sister says, \"Beaumont.\"--Ed.] Beaumont, Texas, is right, sister. And they--they... His baby was laying, dying, and they thought it was already dead. It wasn't breathing no more. And Earl made his way around to my room, as a daddy, bending shoulders, stooped down before me, as I was in bed. Rolled out; he put his arms around me and said, \"Brother, I believe you are God's prophet. I've always believed that. And if you'll just say the word, though my baby is dead, yet shall it live.\" And his baby come back to life, is living.\n\nL-37 Do you believe he is worthy of the right hand of fellowship of these believers? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Let us pray, brothers, as we lay hands on him.\n\nL-38 Gracious Heavenly Father, we lay hands, again, on our Brother Martin. We send him, Lord, to the utmost parts that Thou has ordained that he should go; wherever it is, many or few, by-ways, highways, hedges, if it be. Wherever it is, Lord, may Your blessings be with him. We lay our hands upon him as we bid him Your speed and give him our blessings, that the Spirit that's upon us, Lord, may go with him, and will guide him and direct him to the lost souls out in the hedges and highways. We send him, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you, Brother Martin. Go now, and the Lord be with you.\n\nL-39 For the same purpose? [Brother Richard Blair speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] Richard is your name? [\"Right. Richard Blair.\"] How many know Richard Blair? How many believe him to be a servant of God? He comes from the--the group of the United Pentecostal church. And brother, Brother Blair, I remember a great calling, of his. I remember the time where Brother Blair would not, didn't want to believe me, because that there was a spirit working with him, telling him that I was false. And while he was setting right in the meeting, the Holy Spirit turned around and called it out. [Brother Blair says, \"That's right.\"--Ed.] And he was just about ready for a--a breakdown, and that's what got him in that shape. And I remember his lovely wife calling me one day. She said, \"Brother Branham, I believe Richard is going to die.\" And she had, I believe, a scarf. She went and laid it on him, as I asked her, and prayed. Here he is. [Brother Blair says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-40 A little baby had been in an accident, or... [Brother Blair says, \"My boy.\"--Ed.] His boy, in an accident, that they didn't give much hope for it, with a concussion of the brain. And with prayer, even by the phone, the baby was made well. [\"Amen.\"] Do you believe Brother Blair is a true witness of Christ? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] You pray that your blessings go with him. Brethren, lay your hands on him.\n\nL-41 Dear God, to identify our gracious and noble brother, Your servant, that has even come from his own group, to walk in Light. Father, we pray that You'll bless our Brother Blair, as we send him with our blessings and our sanction, by our hands upon him, to wherever You may call him, Lord, to whatever work it may be. May Your Spirit go with Brother Blair. Guide him and direct him to the lost and dying of this world, that he may help find that lost sheep, that he might bring it back to the fold. Wherever it might be, whatever You have for him, Lord, we just ask that Your Spirit guide him and direct him throughout his life's journey. We are his brethren. In giving him the right hand of fellowship, we ask You to go with him, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. The right hand of fellowship! God bless you, Brother Blair. We are with you, one hundred percent, pray for you and will do anything we can to help you along. God bless you.\n\nL-42 [Brother Merlin Anthon says, \"It's the same for me, Brother Branham, for ordination.\"--Ed.] What say? [\"Ordination.\"] Who are you? [\"Merlin Anthon.\"] Merlin Anthon. [\"I'm in the church.\"] Where? [\"Here in the church.\"] In the church. Anybody know Brother Merlin Anthon? He is new, to me. [\"With the Salvation Army. Remember me?\"] Oh, yes. Pardon me, brother. 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min From the Salvation Army, that's right, I remember him. Sure, I know him now. I just... His face didn't look familiar to me just then, at this time. How many knows him to be a man of God? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] How many believes that--that God is working with him, raise your hand. [\"Amen.\"] Will you pray for him? [\"Amen.\"]\n\nL-43 Now, brother, we know that you coming from a great group of people, Salvation Army, they're a great people. But, and, but the Salvation Army does do a great work out on the street. We can say nothing against the Nazarene, the Pentecostal church, or the Salvation Army, or any of them; they are our brethren. But, you see, we believe that we are carriers of a great Message for this very hour that we're living in. You want to do that with us? [Brother Anthon says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Let us bow our heads while we lay our hands on our brother.\n\nL-44 Dear Heavenly Father, You are the One that does the calling. You are the One that quickens the Word, so that they can believe. And we lay our hands upon our precious brother, as a sanction that we believe that You are with him and will help him. We send our blessings with him, that we who believe that we've passed from death unto Life and now hold quickening Power in our hearts, by the grace of God. We lay hands upon our brother and send him with our blessings, that You will lead him and guide him and direct him to every crevice of the earth, Lord, that You have ordained for him to go. May Your Spirit go with him and give him health, strength, and success in his ministry, for we send him in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-45 God bless you, brother. That's the right hand of fellowship, you know, brothers shake hands with him, brethren like that. So that's you're... All right, the Lord bless you all.\n\nL-46 [Brother Carrell says, \"I--I never was done, officially. Want you to lay your hands on me, as those, in the Name of Jesus.\"--Ed.] You, whatever you wish.

[Brother Carrell says, \"I was an ordained minister, but I couldn't agree with the brother who was ordaining women as ministers, and I had to break off from it.\"--Ed.] This is Brother Carrell from Cincinnati. Anybody know Brother Carrell, raise your... Being from Cincinnati, I doubt it, that anybody know. He says that he was with a group, and the group wanted to ordain women ministers. He couldn't stand it, and he had to break away from them. That's exactly how I broke away from the Missionary Baptists. Doctor Roy E. Davis, how many ever heard him? Sure, you did, see. He wanted to ordain some women preachers, and I said, \"No, sir. As an elder,\" I said, \"I cannot do that, consciously. It's against the Word of God.\"\n\nL-47 I don't know you, Brother Carrell. But upon the basis of your testimony, and that Truth that you stand for... We have nothing against those women. They are sisters. We love them. But we believe that they got their place, and that they must stay. See? And we believe that they are a darling to a man, a helpmate. And by no means... We think they're the greatest gift, outside of salvation, that God ever give a man. But she's got no place in the pulpit, according to the Word of God. Upon that basis, and your faith in God, we lay hands on you, as fellowship, to come go with us. Let us lay our hands on him.\n\nL-48 Our dear Heavenly Father! This young man, I can just about know how he feels. He's been pushed out because of the real Truths. That, \"Man shall live not by bread alone, but by every Word.\" So we lay hands on him, placing our blessings upon him. May Your Spirit lead him, guide him, and direct him throughout life's journey to wherever You may send him, Lord. Let him know that we are praying for him, and will be a help to him, and support him as long as he will stand for the Truth. Grant it, Lord. We send him, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you, Brother Carrell. You just get them hands laid on, the different ones. All of you give kind of the right hands of fellowship for that.

Amen.\n\nL-50 Brother Ruddell, you've always got a right hand of fellowship. I know Brother Ruddell. Seems like--like my own boy. His daddy and I, mother, have knowed one another so long. And I know Brother Ruddell to be a servant of God. I've served with him. God bless you, Brother Ruddell.\n\nL-51 What's his name? Who are you, brother? [Someone says, \"Brother-in-law to Brother Martin.\"--Ed.] Brother Martin, you know him, Brother Martin? What's your name? [The brother says, \"Rev. McComas.\"--Ed.] Brother McComas.

Brother McComas, where you from, Brother McComas? [\"Rockford, Illinois.\"] Rockford, Illinois. [\"You called my home, last week, or last Monday night, and prayed for my wife.\"] Oh, is that right? From Tucson. [\"Tucson, Arizona.\"] Oh, I remember the call now. [\"She got up the next morning.\"] Praise the Lord! [Brother Martin says something to Brother Branham--Ed.] What say? [\"My youngest sister.\"] Your sister. [\"She is here now. Was paralyzed.\"] So, she is here now, was prayed for, the other night, from Tucson, by telephone. [\"Paralyzed.\"] Par-... [\"She was paralyzed, and she is here now.\"] She was paralyzed, a few nights ago, and she is here now. Brother Martin knows it, friend. No wonder he wants to take the Message! Let us lay hands upon, brethren.\n\nL-52 Dear God, I lay hands, with these others, upon Your servant, and give to him the right hand of fellowship, praying that the blessings of God will...?... [Brother Branham's statements cannot be heard clearly--Ed.]...?... that You've ordained him to be. Your blessing be on him, and guide him and direct him, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. The right hand of fellowship, my brother, and those be with you. God be with you.\n\nL-53 [Someone says, \"Brother Branham?\"--Ed.] Yes, brother?

And--and Sister Vayle, I guess, Brother Vayle, and them who know him, and know him to be a man of God, a servant of God. Wonderful!\n\nL-54 Well, now, my dear brother, to be a carrier of the Message, we want you to know that we'll stand behind you, do everything that we can. We'll be praying for you, that you also will carry this Message to the utmost parts of wherever God has ordained you to go. Let us lay our hands on our Brother Darris. Dear God, now we lay our hands upon our brother, giving him the right hand of fellowship, and send him in the Name of Jesus Christ, that You'll anoint him. And...?... give him the right hand of fellowship!...?... And Your Spirit go with him, and guide him and direct him, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you, brother.\n\nL-55 I--I believe, Brother Anthony. Many of you know Brother Anthony. He has been here with us a long time. I know him to be a servant of Christ, myself. I believe he's a dedicated young man. He's never officially had hands laid on him. He didn't know this was coming, friends. See? But right now is good as any. So we're going to lay hands on Brother Anthony and just give him the right hand of fellowship. God has to do the ordaining. This is just to let him know, and you know, that we believe this brother and we love him, and he's one of us, in the Message. And we want him to have God's blessings, and that's what we ask on him. Let's pray, as we lay our hands on, brother.\n\nL-56 Dear God, this humble little, Italian servant of Yours, Lord, comes tonight, that to--to have hands laid upon him, and the right hand of fellowship, officially, extend unto him, from the church. Lord, Your great Power send this young boy to the far end of the earth, in the crevice that you've called him to. And may he go and deliver them people from sin and sickness, and to serve You, Lord, all the days of his life. May You lead him, guide him. May our blessings be 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min with him, as we send him, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you.\n\nL-57 [Someone speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] Huh? Oh, I don't know. We're on a telephone hookup; fifty cents a minute. Was there somebody else here was want... Step up here and call your names, who you are, brethren, just in the microphone right up here. Just tell them. [Each brother says his own name, \"Pat Tyler,\" \"Claude Boggess,\" \"Dale Potter,\" \"...?... Henasey,\" \"James Humes,\" \"Earl Horner.\"--Ed.] Is that them? [Someone says, \"Yes.\"] My brethren. These men, do you believe this Message to be the Truth from God's Word? [The brethren say, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Do you believe that with all your heart? [\"Amen.\"] All right. And you are desirous, and think if we lay hands upon you... We want you to know that we are with you, and we'll do anything that we can do to help you. And now I want you brethren, so that I can lay hands on them too, to step right up here now. And let's all bow our heads, as we lay hands on them. Dear God, here is a group of man. I lay my hands upon each of them, in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And may You, Who has called them to be ministers, that may they a preach It, Lord, all the days of their life. And...?... preach the Gospel to every creature. We give to them the right hand of fellowship, and pray Your blessings to be with them, Lord, as we bless them, send our blessings. May it go to every crevice of the earth that you've called them to go to. May they work and serve You in the capacity that You called them to. May they be gallant and real servants of God. Grant it, Lord. And we ask it in Jesus Christ's Name.\n\nL-58 God bless you, each, brothers. God bless you. God bless you, brother. God bless you. God bless you, Brother Humes. The Lord be with you, each one. Blest be the tie that binds Our hearts in Christian love; The fellowship of kindred mind Is like to that Above.\n\nL-59 Isn't He wonderful? Just think now, how many ministers is here tonight to have hands laid upon them!\n\nL-60 I didn't know that we were on this telephone hookup. If the people out there will forgive me for that; I didn't know it. See? I just didn't know they was going to hook this little Message up tonight. But we're...\n\nL-61 Now we'll read the Word and pray, and get straight into this Message that I feel that the Holy Spirit would have me to bring to you tonight.\n\nL-62 And now while we are turning back in the... for the text, I'll announce it in a moment. Let's turn to Numbers, the 22nd chapter, verse 31. Numbers 22:31, for a text. While you're turning, if you like to read, read it or mark it. [Numbers 22:31]\n\nL-63 I want you all remember me now, until I get to see you again, I hope, sometime this summer, the Lord willing. And if anything happens, I don't get to go overseas, I'll be back. But we are now believing that, how all this has worked around, that the Holy Spirit is going to send us now on a way that He has chosen for Himself to send us. And that's the way we want to do it. The Lord bless!\n\nL-64 Father, we're about to read Your Word. Will You bless It and anoint It to our understanding, we ask in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-65 The Book of Numbers, the 22nd chapter and the 31st verse. And the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face. [Numbers 22:31]\n\nL-66 Now, in the reading of this, to build a context around it, I want to take the subject: Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?\n\nL-67 That's quite a text, and it's a great Truth that we ought to understand. Can God say anything and then say, \"I'm sorry I said it\"? Can God take His Word back, after He said It? 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min\n\nL-68 Now, in this statement here, the reason I chose this statement, was because it's one of the statements of the Bible that a reader, trying to see, or try to say that God does change His mind; this would be more like that He changed His mind than any place in the Bible, I know of, because He told Balaam one thing and then told him another. And now, many people has tried to make Balaam just a, oh, a soothsayer or something. But Balaam was not a soothsayer. He was a prophet of the Lord. [Numbers 22:5, 9-12]\n\nL-69 Now, we'll kind of get the outline of the Message, first. Israel was in their journey from Pales-... going to Palestine, coming from Egypt. And the Lord was with them, and they were... Every enemy that had raised up before Israel was moved out of the way, for God said He would send hornets before them and would drive out the enemy, as long as they walked in obedience to His command. The job was never too big. The Amalekites, the giants of the day, meant nothing to Israel. Though they were small man in statue, but they were walking in THUS SAITH THE LORD. So no matter what the opposition was, God always seen that His Words of promise never failed Israel. [Exodus 23:20-33]\n\nL-70 And Israel of the Old Testament is a type of the Bride of the New Testament, coming up out of the--the world, marching on the road to Canaan, or the Canaan that we go to, the Millennium.\n\nL-71 Now, now, we notice Moab here is a type of the church. And Moab... They had just slew some kings and had routed the enemy, killed off everything, possessed the land, and moved up by Moab. Now, Moab was by no means a heathen nation. Moab was a nation that served the same God that Israel served. And the land of Moab was originally started with Lot's son, by his own daughter. And he, being the founder of this nation, and had organized his celebrities and so forth, and made a great nation out of it, and they had multiplied and went on.\n\nL-72 And, now, Israel was of the seed of Abraham, not of Lot. Israel come out of Isaac, Jacob. And Israel sprung out of those twelve tribes from Jacob, which was later called \"Israel,\" because he wrestled with the Lord. And Moab here...\n\nL-73 Now, in this, and you people out in the--on the telephones, I want to first say that I--I do not wish to be critical, and I hope I'm not. But, the Message that's been given to me, I must be faithful to that Message, or I'll be a hypocrite. See? I--I can't say no more than what I am sent to say. And I--I am thinking that the great enemy of the Christian society today is the organized churches. I do believe with all my heart that it'll finally form into the mark of the beast, which I can, think I can prove that by the Bible with God's help. I have already done it. That, it will form into the mark of the beast, in the federation of the churches. Because, God never did, at any time, ever recognize a ordained church, organized church, never. He never did do it. And every time that man made an organization, the Spirit of God left it and never did return again. Ask any historian, or you may be a reader yourself. Never! When they organized, God laid it on the shelf, and that's where it went; it stayed, from then on. They growed in members, but never a wakening of the Spirit; never, no more. [Revelation 17:1-18]\n\nL-74 Moab, here, is a type of such, because they were a--a organized nation; in their own land, like in their denomination. And there had their own religions, and their religion was the same religion that Israel had. They were Moabites and believed in Jehovah God, but they was an organized group of people.\n\nL-75 And, now, as they represent the natural church, Israel represents the spiritual church in its journey. Now, Israel was not an organized nation. As long as they followed God, they were independent. They come up, sojourners, no place to go. Wherever the Pillar of Fire went, they went with It. They were not a organized nation. They had a organism among them, because circumcision gave them that under the commandment by God, but never an organized nation at this time. When they finally become an organized nation, that's where they fell and rejected their Messiah. [Nehemiah 9:7-15], [Exodus 13:11-22], [Numbers 14:14]\n\nL-76 And now we find, always, that when these natural and spiritual, spirits of churches and organizations, meet, there is always a clash. It's never failed to be so. It always clashes. Because, we find that in there is a jealousy. And, in this jealousy, it causes carnal comparisons, impersonations. And we find it in today, as it was then. When God does something for an individual, everybody tries to copy just like God did for that person. See, it causes a competition, and it makes carnality. And then if they cannot, the other side, get the spiritual results, then they take it by a political power, or they substitute something, to upset the people's minds, to draw disciples after themselves. [Genesis 4:3-8], [Numbers 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min 16:3], [Hebrews 11:4], [II Thessalonians 2:1-4], [Hebrews 11:4], [Jude 1:11], [I John 3:12]\n\nL-77 That's exactly what took place at the very beginning; as Cain and Abel, both boys here on earth. And when Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, and God vindicated Abel, by coming down and receiving his sacrifice; it caused jealousy with Cain, because he was jealous of his brother, and slew his brother. [Genesis 4:3-8]\n\nL-78 It started at the beginning, that when the natural and the spiritual, yet Cain and Abel worshiped the same God. They both built the same kind of altars. And they both worshiped the same God, at the same church, same altar. But Cain, by carnal reasoning, brought in the fruits of the land and laid them upon the altar as a sacrifice, thinking that surely that this would answer to God for an atonement. So he must have brought in, as people think today, \"apples that Adam and Eve took, that caused the sin.\" And, whatever, I think now they got it down to a \"pomegranate\" or something now. Some of them said, not long ago, it was something else. [Genesis 4:3-8]\n\nL-79 And, but Abel had the right sacrifice. He knowed that it was blood that did it, so he brought a lamb. And when God received his, now, Abel, by faith, by revelation, no other way. There was no Bible written. So, you see, the beginning of righteousness is God's revealed Truth, and the entire Church of the living God is built upon that. [Genesis 4:3-8], [Hebrews 11:4]\n\nL-80 Jesus, one day, coming off the mount, said to His disciples, \"Who does man say I the Son of man am?\" \"One said You're 'Moses' and the other one say You're 'Elias' and You're 'Jeremias, or one of the prophets.'\" He said, \"But who do you say that I am?\" [Matthew 16:13-15]\n\nL-81 That's when the apostle Peter, inspired of God, quickened by the Spirit, made that tremendous statement, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" [Matthew 16:16]\n\nL-82 Notice the statement. \"Blessed art thou, Simon, son of Jonas, flesh and blood has not revealed this to you. My Heavenly Father has revealed this to you. Thou art Simon. Upon this rock...\" What rock? Now, the Catholic says, \"Upon Peter, the rock, little stone.\" And the Protestant says, \"Upon Christ, the Rock.\" Not to be different; but it was upon the revelation that Peter had, Who He was. \"No man can come to Me,\" said Jesus, \"except My Father draws him. And all the Father has given Me will come to Me.\" \"Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.\" [Matthew 16:17]\n\nL-83 \"Blessed art thou, Simon, son of Jonas; flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father which is in Heaven. Upon this rock I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell can't prevail against it.\" Spiritual revealed Word of God! [Matthew 16:17-18]\n\nL-84 Notice, Abel, by faith in God, offered a more excellent sacrifice. And the carnal believer thought that it was the works of his own hands, that, and his fruits and his beautiful offering that he brought, that God would recognize, and it made a clash. We find that Abraham and Lot had to clash. [Hebrews 11:4], [Genesis 13:1-15]\n\nL-85 We find that Moses and--and Dathan, Korah, had the same clash. Moses, being a ordained prophet with the Word of the Lord, vindicated that he was chosen to be their leader of the hour, and that Abraham had promised all these things, and here Moses did exactly what God said it would be, take place. And Korah, being carnal, wanted to raise up an organization among them. He wanted to make a group of man. And God doesn't deal with people like that. It shows right there, in that Scripture, a type of the journey today, that organization is not what God ordains. For, as soon as Korah done it, he said to Moses, \"You take too much upon yourself.\" In other words, \"The whole congregation is holy! Why, you say you're the only holy man. You have no right to do any such as that. You try to make yourself somebody big. We're all holy. We're all God's children.\" [Numbers 16:3]\n\nL-86 And Moses just turned his head and walked away. He said, \"Lord, what will I do?\"\n\nL-87 God said, \"Separate yourself from him. I've had enough of it.\" And He swallowed him up in the earth. [Numbers 16:21] 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min\n\nL-88 See, there was a clash. When the carnal and the spiritual meets, there is always a clash. When Judas and Jesus met, there was a clash; One, the Son of God; the other one, the son of Satan. Just like Cain and Abel, there was a clash when they met. One of them was the treasurer of the church, and the other One a pastor. And as now, we come in this day, to the same thing again. The carnal denomination to the spiritual Bride of Christ. The spiritual Bride of Christ is so much different from the carnal organizations, till there's no comparison in them at all. [Genesis 4:3-8], [John 12:1-6]\n\nL-89 Now notice, the natural always tries to type the spiritual. But, as in Jacob and Esau, it will not work. It would not. Now, when it come to doing good works, I--I believe that Esau actually was a better man than Jacob, in the sight of man. He tried to take care of his daddy; he was blind, a prophet. And all these things that he tried to do, but yet Esau didn't think about that being just carnal work. He thought he could get in by what he done, do something good for somebody, which was all right. But Jacob, his whole soul was to get that birthright, and that's what God recognized in him spiritual. [Romans 9:10-18]\n\nL-90 Notice, and it's always caused the natural to hate the spiritual. It caused Cain to hate Abel. It caused Korah to hate Moses. It caused Judas to hate Jesus. And on and on it goes. It causes the natural to hate the spiritual, just as Cain at the beginning hated Abel, the one that God received the sacrifice from, and tries to destroy them. [Genesis 4:3-8], [Numbers 16:1-50] Even they try to destroy the influence. They try to destroy everything, because it's nothing but jealousy. It started in Cain and proved that it was jealousy, and it's still the same thing today when the natural (the carnal) and the spiritual meet together. It proves it's Satan, no other way, because jealousy comes from Satan. And then causes an impersonation of the Truth, somebody to try to impersonate something that isn't, they are not ordained to do. How much of that have we seen in these last days! Oh, my, how much of it! [Hebrews 11:4]\n\nL-91 So we see God does for-... not forever change His mind about His original Word. But, who He calls, that's who He ordains. No one else can take that place. No one could take Moses' place. No matter how many Korah's raised up, and how many Dathan's; it was Moses, God had called, regardless. [Numbers 16:1-37], [Numbers 26:9-10], [Psalms 106:15-16]\n\nL-92 But, and if the people won't walk in His perfect will, He does have a permissive will He'll let you walk in. Notice, He permits it, all right, but He will make it work out for His glory, in His perfect will. Now if you'd like...\n\nL-93 Just like, in the beginning, it was not God's perfect will for children to be born on the earth through sex. No, sir. God created man out of the dust of the earth, breathed the breath of life into him, and he become a living soul. He took from that man a helpmate, and made a wife to him. That was God's first and original will. But when sin come in and did the thing that it did, then He permitted man to marry a wife, legally, and have children by her. \"Multiply and replenish the earth, then, if that's the way you're going to do it.\" But, you see, it never was His perfect will. [Genesis 1:26-28]\n\nL-94 Therefore, all these things that had a beginning has to have an end. All sin has to come to annihilation. All sin has to be done away with. Therefore, in the great Millennium when the resurrection comes, we will not have to be reborn again by our fathers and mothers, but God like He did in the beginning will call man from the dust of the earth, and his helpmate with him. That's right. That's the way He did it at the beginning. [Genesis 1:26-28]\n\nL-95 So therefore, God never changes His mind about anything, but He will permit you to go on. Now, this is a long ways around to get to what I want to say here about this. But, and, but, it's, you'll... I want you to understand it. See? God will permit you to do something, and even bless you in doing it, but still it isn't His perfect will. [Genesis 3:15-22]\n\nL-96 God permitted Israel to take a law, in Exodus the 19th chapter. When grace had already give them a prophet, Pillar of Fire, a sacrifice lamb, a delivering power, but they cried out for a Law. It wasn't God's will, but it was injected because man wanted it. And he was cursed by the very law that he wanted. [Exodus 20:1-22]\n\nL-97 It's best to have God's will. That's what He taught us. \"Thy will be done. Thy Kingdom come. Thine will be done.\" We must submit ourselves to His will and His Word. Don't question It. Believe It. Don't try to find a way around It. Just take It the way It is. So many wants to go around, get some other way. And when you do, you find yourself going on, you find God blessing 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min you, but you're working in His permissive will and not in His perfect, Divine will. [Matthew 6:10]\n\nL-98 He permits it, as I said, but He will not--He will not let it be His perfect will; but He'll make it work to honor and bless His perfect will. And childbearing, by sex, is one of that. [Genesis 3:15-22]\n\nL-99 Now notice, Moab, to begin with, was a illegitimate nation. It started out, illegitimate, yet by a--a father believer and a daughter believer. Just exactly, if you will type that and use a spiritual mind, you can see that denomination standing there just as plain as anything. Sure. See, the whole thing is altogether wrong. And, look, when it's brought, started like that, it can never... It keeps, like a ball of snow, it just keeps rolling more and more and more. You get one error, and start on that one error, and you just keep rolling one thing after another, and one thing like another, all after another. [Genesis 19:29-38]\n\nL-100 And that's the way the church started. That's the way it started at Nicaea, Rome, when the Roman Catholic church... At the very beginning, where it come from, was Pentecost. But when they organized and brought in the celebrity, into the church, they started to making, having prayers, and running beads, and--and praying for the dead, and all these other things. And then it just started rolling, from one error to another, one error to another, until look where it's gone to. There is not one representation of pentecost in it, at all. See? It's one error picking up another, picking up another. There is only one thing to do, that's, clean off the record and go back to the beginning. [Genesis 19:15-22]\n\nL-101 When, Martin Luther started off with justification. This ought to be the further advanced, Lutheran church. See? If... Luther, when he organized, he could not take Wesley's sanctification, because he was organized; and the men wouldn't stand for it, so the Spirit moved out of it.\n\nL-102 Now, Lot's group here; or, Moab was Lot's daughter's child, illegitimate to start with. Now notice, as the natural church, Moab, represents the natural denomination. Israel represents the spiritual Church. Israel, there was a church true, was the bride of that day, called out of Egypt, and vindicated to be the truth. [Genesis 19:15-22]\n\nL-103 Notice when they, them two come together. Both of them offered the same sacrifice, both built, saw seven altars, both offered up clean sacrifice, ox. And they even offered up rams, testifying that there was a coming Messiah. Fundamentally, they were both exactly the same. Israel, down here in the valley; Moab, up on the hill. And Moab with seven altars; Israel with seven altars. Moab with seven ox; Israel with seven ox. Moab with seven rams, speaking of the coming Messiah; Israel with seven rams. [Numbers 23:1-10] What was the difference in them? Fundamentally, both right. But, you see, Moab did not have the vindication of God with them; they were only a nation, a group of celebrities. But Israel had a prophet with them. They had a smitten Rock with them. They had a Pillar of Fire. They had a brass serpent, for healing. They had the blessings of God moving right along with them, and they was the called-out children of God.\n\nL-104 Now we find that so perfectly typed here in them churches of today. As, Moab was not so. Israel was a sojourner, from place to place; wherever that Pillar of Fire moved, they moved with It. Moab, not so; they were settled down in their own denomination, down in their own nation. They didn't move, they stayed right there. They had their celebrities. They ordained things as they should do, and they had their warriors, they had their fighters, they had their king they had, that they got their orders from, and so on.\n\nL-105 But Moab seen Israel with something that they didn't have. They seen a mighty power amongst Israel, and it was a prophet. And that prophet was Moses. And they knowed that when the battle went wrong, they just raised up his hands and held them up there, and the battle changed. So they didn't have such as that, so they try to match it with politics, with a political pull. They sent over to another country and hired a prophet to come over, so they could have a prophet, and would have power amongst them just like Israel had amongst them. [Numbers 22:4-15]\n\nL-106 Do you see the carnal comparison? Can you see the carnal church today? It's done the very same thing.\n\nL-107 Notice, now, they're both going to have prophets. The only different was, Moses, the prophet of God, his King was God. That's where he got his orders, the Word of the Lord. And Balaam, he also, he had a king, and that king was 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min Balak, the king of Moab, and that's where he got his orders and his blessings. So Moab said to Balak, \"Come down,\" or Balaam, said, \"come down and curse me this people, for they cover the whole face of the earth. They just come and lick up everything like an ox licks up the grass.\" Said, \"Come down now. And I understand that you can curse, you can bless, whatever you do is recognized.\" [Numbers 22:4-6]\n\nL-108 Now, we want to notice that this man was a prophet ordained of God, but he sold his birthrights for political reasons. Just as the church did today, like Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, and the whole group of them, sold it out for pulls in their organization. Moses, under God; Balaam, under Balak. Yet, both prophets were called-man of God, and both spiritual. Notice the difference. Each had a head; Moses' was God; Balaam's was Balak. [Numbers 22:4-6]\n\nL-109 Notice here how the spiritual is applied, to prove that the natural is wrong. Moses, sent of God, in line of duty, is met and challenged by another prophet of God. Can you imagine that! Moses, called of God, ordained of God, standing in the duty of God; moved up into this cold, formal group, and was challenged by another prophet of God, what God had blessed and ordained. How would you tell the difference? They both had prophets. God spoke to both prophets. [Numbers 24:1-10]\n\nL-110 And some of them say, \"God said, 'Do this.' God said, 'Do that.'\" Now, I don't question that, but it's out of the line of God's Word. The prophet, no matter if he is a prophet, he's out of the line. So many people get deceived like that. \"Oh, this brother can do this, and this brother can do that,\" and deny the Word?\n\nL-111 \"Though I speak with tongue of men and angels, though that I have gifts, that I can move mountains, though I give all my goods to feed the poor, I am yet nothing.\" [I Corinthians 13:1-4] \"Many will come to Me in that day, and say, 'Lord, Lord, have not I prophesied in Your Name? Have not, in Your Name, I've cast out devils and done mighty works?' And I will say unto them, 'Depart from, you... Depart from Me, you workers of iniquity. I never even knew you.'\" Yet, they come with a confession that they have did it, but Jesus said, \"They were workers of iniquity.\" What is iniquity? Is something that you know you should do, that's right to do, and yet you don't do it. See what it's going to be in the last days? , [Matthew 7:22-23]\n\nL-112 Hear the whole line! That was my purpose tonight. I said I'd be out at nine o'clock, but I'm going to be a little bit after, maybe. Look, that was my whole purpose, to show you this line, by the Word of God, see, that--that God has to keep His Word in order to stay God.\n\nL-113 Now, we notice that both of these were spiritual men, both were prophets, both were called. And Moses, right in the line of duty, with a fresh Pillar of Fire before him every day, the Spirit of God upon him, in the line of duty. Here comes another servant of God, called of God, ordained of God, a prophet to whom the Word of God comes to. Here is the danger line. There is nobody could dispute that man being of God--of God, because the Bible said the Spirit of God spoke to him, and he was a prophet. But, you see, when he got the real answer from God, he wouldn't keep It. He didn't notice It, then he went to challenge Moses. [Numbers 24:1-10]\n\nL-114 Now, Balaam sought the will of God, with all of his heart. Now, when these great man come over and said, \"Balaam! Balak the king has sent, that you come to him immediately and curse this people Israel, because they're scattered all over the face of the earth, and now they're camping against me. And they've licked up every kingdom around, below them. And now we want you to come over and curse this people. Because, I understand that if you curse anyone, he is cursed.\" Now, you see, he was a man of God. \"What you bless, is blessed.\" He was a servant of God. [Numbers 24:1-15]\n\nL-115 And Balaam now thought, being a prophet, \"There is only one thing for me to do, and that's seek out what is the will of God.\" [Numbers 22:1-8]\n\nL-116 That's the duty of a prophet, if he's called to be a prophet. First, what must a prophet do? Is seek out the will, the Word of God. He must do it. Because, being a prophet, the Word of God comes to him. The... They say, \"Well, you're not a theologian.\" Never does the Bible say the Word of God come to a theologian. They're the one who messes It up. The Word comes to the prophet of God. [Numbers 22:1-8], [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-117 And here was a man who was a prophet of God. And when he was hired, to be hired, to come over and curse 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min another people of God, notice, he went to seek the will of God. And he wanted to know His perfect will, and God gave him His perfect will in the matter. His perfect will was presented to him. What was His will? \"Don't you go!\" That's God's first Word. \"Don't go with them. Don't you try to attack My people, walking in My perfect ways.\" [Numbers 22:12]\n\nL-118 How that is today, want to fuss, debate, and everything else, when they see the Spirit of God working among you. And they're trying to, they've tried it for years, to smother It down. But more they try to smother It, the greater It grows. You can't curse what God has blessed. You just can't. You just can't do it. [Numbers 22:8-12]\n\nL-119 So, you see, that was God's people. Now, that prophet, though he was up there and hired by the king, worked among the celebrities, and so forth. And the Word of God came to him. He sought the will of God, and the will of God spoke back to him, and said, \"Don't curse this people. I blessed them.\" [Numbers 22:12]\n\nL-120 Now there isn't a theologian under the skies that can deny this Message that we're preaching, but what It's exactly the Word of God right in time. God has a vindicate it, in everything that's been said or done. He's proved It to be right. Now, there's no theologian, no Bible reader, no prophet, can look in that Word, if he is a prophet, he'll see the same thing. But if he doesn't see the same thing, that show's there is something wrong. Because...\n\nL-121 You say, \"Well, oh, I could take it vice versa.\" So could Balak, Balaam. See? But God identified Moses. And then what was the proof? The Word of God. And he heard the plain, clean-cut decision of God, \"Don't you go. Don't try to--to curse what I've blessed. Them is My people.\" But you know what? Balaam didn't like them people, to begin with. Oh, what a... How many Balaam's is there in the world today! He didn't like that group, to start with. [Numbers 22:1-15]\n\nL-122 Now, after he got God's clean-cut decision, \"Don't you go.\" But, you see, instead of doing it, it was the same thing like Cain, like Korah, he was jealous, and he--he wanted to, a reason to go, anyhow. [Numbers 22:8-12]\n\nL-123 Notice, his denominational headquarters, after he sent back, said, \"Nope, don't believe I'll go down. Don't believe I'll have anything to do with them. I won't debate with them people, 'cause God's done told me they are His people, and I don't believe I'll go.\" If he'd have stayed with that! But, down in his heart, he didn't like them. See? They wasn't of his group. And anything that didn't belong in his group, \"wasn't right, to begin with.\" See? And he looked down at them, said, \"There has been some awful things them people did. Surely a holy God will curse such a people as that. They're, they're illiterate. They're not educated like us. We're a smarter people. Oh, they claim to serve God, but, look at them, what are they? A bunch of, why, a bunch of slaves, mud-daubers, that the Egyptians run out down there. Why, God would never have anything to do with a dirty bunch like that!\" [Numbers 22:8-20]\n\nL-124 He failed to see that smitten Rock and that brass serpent, that Pillar of Fire. He tried to judge them from a moral standpoint. He failed to see the higher call of God. By grace, by election, they were in that line, and with God's Word. And when he wanted to curse them, God said, \"Don't you do it. They're Mine. Leave them alone. Don't you touch them.\" [Numbers 22:8-15], [Numbers 21:1-9]\n\nL-125 Now, so the man turned around, went back. Now watch his denominational headquarters, though, when he gets back. They sent a more influential group. This time they might have been some, instead of just regular layman, they might have been doctors of divinity come this time. They might have been bishops, or maybe state presbyters, for all... He sent a--a--a better group, and a--a little more influential group, somebody that had a little better education and could lay out the plan to him better, could make it reasonable. [Numbers 22:15]\n\nL-126 See, that's what Cain did; he reasoned. That's what Korah did; he reasoned. It's not him that reasons. \"We cast down reasonings.\" We believe God, no matter what anything else says. We believe God. We don't reason what God says. You can't reason with It. You have to accept It by faith. And anything that you know, you don't have to reason any more. I don't know how He does it; I just believe He does it. I don't know how He is going to keep that promise; but He said He would do it. I believe it. I accept it on the basis that I believe that it's the Word of God. You say, \"Well, you can't get by with that.\" I don't know how I'll get by with it, but He said, \"Say it.\" 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min I remember my Baptist pastor told me, said, \"Why, Billy, you will preach to the posts in the church. Why, you think anybody will hear a thing like that?\" I said, \"God has said so.\" \"How are you going to, with a seventh-grade education, pray for kings, and preach around the world?\" [II Corinthians 10:5]\n\nL-127 I said, \"I don't know how I'm going to do it, but, He said so, and that's just good enough for me.\" See? \"He said so. I don't know how it's going to be done.\" He said, \"Do you think the people in this great, educated world that you're going to stand up against, on this subject of Divine healing and so forth, do you think they'll believe that?\"\n\nL-128 I said, \"It ain't for me to know whether they believe It or not.\" I said, \"My duty is to preach It. That's what He told me. He said He would be with me, and He's told me what it would do.\" And it's done just exactly what He said it would do. \"First, take a hold of their hands; then it'll come to pass that you'll even know the secret of their heart.\" And I told you about it, and it happened that way. How does it do it? I still don't know how it does it. It's none of my business how it's done; it's just done.\n\nL-129 Who could explain when God told Elijah, \"Go up there and set on the mount, and I'll feed you. I've ordained the--the crows to feed you\"? How could a crow get a slice of bread and a piece--a piece of fish, baked, and bring it to a prophet? That's beyond anything I could explain. I don't think you can either, or nobody can. But He did it. That's all was necessary. He did it, and that's the truth of it. How He did it, I don't know; it's none of my business. But He did it. How He made the earth, I don't know; but He did it. How He sent His Son, I don't know; but He did it. How He rose from the dead, I don't know; but He did it. How did He save me? I don't know; but He did it. That's right. How did He save you? I can't tell you; but He did it. How did He heal me? I don't know; but He did it. He promised He would do it, and He keeps His Word. Now, Balaam should have knowed that, and he did know better. [I Kings 17:4]\n\nL-130 Notice, this better, influential group, come, and what better? They had better gifts. And not only that, they could give him more money, and they could, offered him a better position. \"Now, besides just a regular minister in the organization, we'll make you district superintendent. See? That, we'll--we'll do something for you if you'll just run that bunch of people out of there, see, and stop that.\" Oh, they offered him a great position. Said, \"The more you bless...\" Said, \"You know, I'm able to promote you.\" Look where he's getting his words from, the head of the nation. [Numbers 22:15-17]\n\nL-131 Where was Moses getting his Words from? The King of Heaven. One was the Word of God's promise, \"I'll take you to the promised land, and no man will stand before you. I'll send hornets before you and drive them out, from right to left. And you're going to take the land. I've prom-... I've already give it to you. Go on, take it, possess it; it's yours.\" And now, see, that's Who Moses was listening to. And this man was listening until it come to something in his own heart he was jealous of, and so then he went to his ecclesiastical head. See? [Exodus 23:20-28], [Numbers 22:15-17]\n\nL-132 Notice, a better position. He said, \"You know I'm able to promote you? I will promote you to a better place. I'll do more for you. I'll raise your wages. I'll give you a better salary.\" And when he offered him all of this, it blinded him. [Numbers 22:15-17]\n\nL-133 How many Balaams are there in the world today, that, by a better position, a better church, a promise of something! When a man gets his eyes opened to the Word and the workings of God... And that good man, who has got influence, will start out as a servant of God, and he holds a good congregation. After a while, the Holy Ghost baptism is presented to him; the baptism in Jesus' Name is presented to him, which is a Scripture and the only Scriptural way to baptize. And when it is presented to him, and the denomination knows they're going to lose him when he starts that, they offer him a better position and a change in church. See, old Balaamism, again, just exactly like it was at the beginning. [Numbers 22:15-17]\n\nL-134 Now, that man who reads that Bible, he can't read It unless he sees that that's the Truth. There is nobody ever baptized using the titles of \"Father, Son, Holy Ghost.\" It's a Catholic creed and not a Bible Doctrine. No person in the 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min Bible was ever baptized, or three hundred years after the death of the last apostle, but what was baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ. The Catholic church started that, and the rest of them come to it. And any minister setting in his study and will look at that, knows that's the Truth. But, for popularity, to hold his position, better thought of among the people, he compromises. [Acts 2:38] \"Well,\" you say, \"God blessed him.\" [Numbers 22:15-18]\n\nL-135 Certainly. Some of them have got gifts of healing, some of them have great campaigns. And that rubbed right in their face, and they get the same answer from the Word of God that you or any other man would get. God doesn't change. See what I mean?\n\nL-136 Balaam, for a better position, he thought. Now look, when that better group come back, the right... Balaam, here, took a phony text. See? He said... The--the better group come back, he--he ought to have said, \"Get out of my presence! I've told you the Word of God. Get going! This is THUS SAITH THE LORD.\" But, you see, the gifts, and to be a more popular man! [Numbers 22:15-18], [Numbers 24:1-25]\n\nL-137 Oh, how they like to do it! \"We'll send you all over the world. We'll give you a special plane. We'll sponsor your meetings everywhere if you'll just...\" Oh, no. Uh-huh. See? We know what the Word says. We know what God said. We're going to stay with that, by God's help. See? No matter what kind of a promise, and how much more you can pay, and how many this, that, or the other you can--you can produce; we want the THUS SAITH THE LORD, and what He said Here first. \"Well, the church said, 'That's secondarily.'\" We want what the God said at the beginning. \"And anything added to It or taken away from It, even your name will be taken off the Book of Life; to add one word to It, or take one Word away from It.\" We want what He said; not what the church said, what Doctor Jones said, what somebody else said. We want what THUS SAITH THE LORD said, what the Word said. [Revelation 22:18-19], [Numbers 22:15-18]\n\nL-138 But now we find Balaam, a servant of God. And many of those man start out, and are ordained of God, and does speak God's Word in many things; but when it comes to the full Truth, they won't do it. [Numbers 22:1-28]\n\nL-139 Notice here, as a prophet of God, he should not been caught in such a group as that, to begin with. He shouldn't have went with them. But, watch, for popularity sake, see, for his conscience's sake, he said, \"Well, stay all night, and I'll try again.\" See, \"I'll try again\"? What do you want to try again for? [Numbers 22:1-28]\n\nL-140 God already told him what to say. God said, \"Tell them you're not going.\" That's His original Word. \"I'm not going. 'And don't you go. Don't you curse what I blessed.'\" Now watch how it backfired on him, after a while. See? And it will, every time. When God says anything, He means it. He don't change His mind about it. He stays right with His Word. No matter what anyone else says, He stays right with that Word. [Numbers 22:2-20]\n\nL-141 Now, Balaam should have knowed better. He should have dismissed himself from such company, but all them nice gifts and a--a--the promise that this king said, \"You know I can do it. I'm the bishop. I can do just whatever I want to, and I'll promote you if you'll come do it for me.\" And God done told him, \"Don't do it.\" [Numbers 22:1-28]\n\nL-142 But yet Balaam said, \"You, you stay all night, and I'll--I'll try again.\" See, he had the Word. You don't have to argue anymore about It. God has done said so. With a group like that, they always talk you out of the will of God, if you'll let them. [Numbers 22:15-26]\n\nL-143 There was one group to come to a prophet, one time, named Job. They couldn't talk him out. He saw the vision. He knowed what was right. Balaam saw the vision, and still didn't stay with It.\n\nL-144 No matter how much his church groups said, \"Oh, Job, you ought to do this, you ought to do that.\" Even his wife, he said, \"You talk like a foolish person.\" See? \"I know what the Lord said. I know what He required, and that's what I've done.\" See, he stayed with what God told him. [Job 2:8-10]\n\nL-145 Notice, Balaam using this phony text for his conscience. See? He said, \"Well, I'll--I'll find out. I'll try again.\" 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min Now, there is where you come, secondarily. How many Balaam's have we got tonight, that likes to use that phony text of Matthew 28:19 just for their conscience's sake? How many wants to use Malachi 4 for their conscience's sake? How many wants to use Luke 17:30 just for conscience's sake? How many wants to use these things, yet, \"Well, I tell you, I--I believe they're all mixed up on That\"? [Matthew 28:19], [Malachi 4:5-6], [Luke 17:30], [Numbers 22:12-25], [Numbers 24:1-15]\n\nL-146 And then here was Balaam trying to say, \"Perhaps maybe God got mixed up. I'll try again, see, see what He said.\" Now, He knows your heart. Notice, Balaam used this phony text for his own conscience's sake, because, actually, he wanted that money. He wanted that dignitary. He wanted that. He wanted that job. He wanted that position, to be looked up to, as Doctor So-and-so. So he--he--he said, \"I'll try again.\" [Numbers 22:12-25]\n\nL-147 Oh, at the Balaam's in the world tonight, promised positions, popularity! My, oh, my! They numb their conscience by them. Because of their denominations, they say, \"If you do that, out you go. I know you're a good man, and we love you,\" and he is a good man, \"we love you. But you can't preach that. Our--our doctrine says you can't do that. Doctor So-and-so said this is the way it is. Now you've got to believe it this way, if you stay with us. Now, if you want to, I know you had a hard time, well, I'll see if I can't get you promoted, maybe change churches.\" Oh, you Balaam! When you know the will of God, you do it! God ain't going to change His mind. No. [Numbers 22:1-28]\n\nL-148 Something that he could pass by, the Truth, for his commission. He said, \"Well, I'll--I'll try again.\" Notice the Balaam's there is. [Numbers 22:1-28]\n\nL-149 So now remember, when he come the second night, with this great celebrity, already had his conscience dull and numb, God let him go. Now, God never changed His mind, but He give him His permissive will. \"Go ahead then.\" But he found out it'll not work. [Numbers 22:2-20]\n\nL-150 God knew what was in Balaam's heart. Though he was a prophet, He knowed he hated them holy-rollers, and he--and he just... he--he was going to want to curse them, anyhow. And God done told him not to do it, but yet he come, wanted to do it, again, so God let him go ahead. God said, \"Go ahead.\" Now, remember, He never changed His mind. [Numbers 22:1-25]\n\nL-151 Notice, it was his desire to curse them. The people that he classed as fanatics, he wanted to curse them. He wanted a position. He didn't want to fool with them, so he thought if he could do this little act for the king, then he would be promoted. God never changed His mind or His Word. [Numbers 22:1-28] But He will give you the desire of his heart, of your heart. He promised that. You know that? He promised to give you the desire of your heart. And let your desire be the Word of God. Let your desire be His will, never your own will. His will! If He... You ask Him for something, He don't give it to you, say, \"Thank You, Lord. You know what's good.\" [Romans 12:2], [Hebrews 13:5], [James 4:3], [Psalms 145:16]\n\nL-152 Look at even King Hezekiah, when He sent that prophet up there to him, God did, and said, \"Put your house in order. You're going to die.\" Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and wept bitterly, and said, \"Lord God, I--I ask You to consider me. I've walked before You with a perfect heart. I want You to let me live fifteen years longer.\" [II Kings 20:1-21]\n\nL-153 \"All right.\" God spoke to the prophet, said, \"Go back and tell him I heard him.\" And what did he do? He brought disgrace upon the whole nation. He kindled the anger of God till He would have killed him. That's right. You know that. Backslid on God. It would have been far better on, off, nation, king, and all, if he'd have went on and took God's first thing to him. But it looked hard on the prophet, when the prophet had to go back and speak the Word of God to him, after he done told him. But God said, \"Go ahead.\" But, you see, it brought a disgrace. [II Kings 20:1-21]\n\nL-154 What did Balaam do? After knowing the will of God, and yet he was persistent, he was going to do it, anyhow. And what did it do? Notice. He never changed His mind. He knowed what was in his heart. [II Kings 20:1-21], [Numbers 22:2-26]\n\nL-155 You know, Thomas, one time he just couldn't believe it. No, he--he said, \"Naw, I can't believe that. If I could take 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min my hand and stick it in His side, put it in the nails of His hand, well, then, then I'll--I'll believe it then.\" He said, \"Come here, Thomas. See? Now put your hands in here.\" Now, oh, Thomas said now, \"It's my Lord and my God.\" [John 20:26-28]\n\nL-156 Said, \"Yes, you've seen, and now you believe it. How much greater is their reward, has never seen and yet believe!\" People sometimes won't receive the Holy Ghost unless they speak with tongues. I believe in speaking in tongues, certainly. He's a good God; He'll give you the desire of your heart. But no matter how much you speak in tongues, and deny this Word, you're wrong anyhow. See? See, you don't go in by speaking in tongues. You go in by keeping every Word. That's the evidence of the Holy Ghost, when you believe the Word of God. See? [John 20:27-29]\n\nL-157 I believe in speaking in tongues. I believe you can be quickened, like I said this morning, till you'll speak with a new tongue. I have, myself, and I know it's the Truth. I know it's true. But that's not the sign, you, that you're God's selected child. See? No, indeedy. He never said... [I Corinthians 13:1-5] \"Many will come to Me and say, 'Lord, haven't I prophesied and done all these great things in Your Name?' He'll say, 'Depart from Me, you that work iniquity, I never knew you.'\" [Matthew 7:22-23]\n\nL-158 You speak with tongues and then refuse to be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ? Something wrong somewhere. Yes, indeed; any of those things, any of those orders God give. There is something wrong. Just search your own conscience, and see what--see what the Bible said. Show me some place where somebody was baptized in the name of the \"Father, Son, Holy Ghost.\" See? It's not there. But, you see, sometimes for your conscience's sake, you say, \"Well...\" [Acts 2:38] You say, \"God speaks to the women about how they must do, not wear shorts and things, but, you know, the pastor said...\" So they take the easy way. [I Corinthians 13:1-5]\n\nL-159 They know what God said about it Here. See? Sure, God said so. So they--they--they want to do it, anyhow, see. They try to find an excuse. \"Well, I think it's much better. It's--it's not... The wind don't blow...\" Yeah. [Numbers 22:1-26] But God said for a man to dress different from a woman. \"If a woman put on a garment pertained to a man, it was abomination in His sight.\" So it's not right, yes, and you shouldn't do it. No. See? So, therefore, it's wrong. [Deuteronomy 22:5]\n\nL-160 But, you see, they try to find an excuse, that, \"The Lord told me to do this.\" I don't say He didn't, but, look, it ain't His perfect will. It's got to be His permissive will. You see what it'll do? It'll pollute the whole bunch. It polluted all the camp. [Numbers 22:1-26]\n\nL-161 Notice here, God never changed His mind, His Word. But He is a good God, and He'll give you the desire of your heart, though it be against His will. You believe that? [Numbers 22:2-26], [Psalms 145:16], [Romans 12:2], [Hebrews 13:5], [James 4:3] Look, God told Moses, \"You go down there,\" this anointed prophet. Said, \"Go down there and speak to that rock.\" It's already been smitten. [Numbers 20:7-13], [Deuteronomy 32:48-52]\n\nL-162 Moses went down there in his anger, picked up the rod, and said, \"You rebels, must we fetch you water out of this rock?\" and smote the rock. The water didn't come. He smote it again; it come. It was against God's will. It broke every plan in the Bible; Christ had to be smitten second time. See? Christ was smitten once. It broke the whole plan. But He give him His permissive will. Then, after, he said, \"See, we got the water for you. Yeah, I brought it for you, you bunch of rebels!\" [Numbers 20:7-13], [Deuteronomy 32:48-52]\n\nL-163 God said, \"Come here, Moses. Come here. Come up here on top... You're been a faithful servant.\" (Like the woman with the high heels, \"You climbed,\" see.) \"Look over yonder. See the promised land?\" [Deuteronomy 32:49-50] \"O Lord!\" \"But you're not going over. You took My permissive will, down here at the Rock. You have glorified yourself, see, and not Me. You sanctified yourself. You didn't sanctify Me. You didn't keep My original Word, what I told you to do.\" Yet, the waters did come. [Deuteronomy 32:48-52] 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min You can lay hands on the sick and they recover. You can prophesy, or speak with tongues. But, the thing is, keep His original Word! God don't change His mind, friend. You've got to keep His commission, His will. \"Oh, well, that was for the disciples.\" [Numbers 20:12], [Numbers 22:1-26]\n\nL-164 He doesn't change. If He's still got a disciple, that's the same commission. \"Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel. These signs shall follow them that believe.\" It's never change. He can't change. Now, you can say, \"Well, I tell you, it ain't for this day.\" Oh, you Balaamite! You see? See, God don't change. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. [Mark 16:15-17], [Hebrews 13:8], [Numbers 22:2-26]\n\nL-165 Just look at the Balaamites today. \"Oh, I know, in the Bible they baptized in Jesus' Name, but, look, all the people...\" [Numbers 22:2-26] I don't care what the people has done. \"There is not another Name under Heaven given among men whereby you can be saved.\" \"No remission of sin, only through the Name of Jesus Christ.\" What, how good you are, what you do, that don't have one thing to do with it. It's God's original Word; you got to stay with That. Whew! All right. [Acts 4:12]\n\nL-166 \"Obedience to His Word is better than sacrifice.\" You remember that time when Saul came back. [I Samuel 15:15-25]\n\nL-167 Balaam had a gift of faith and could have used it to the perfect, original Word of God. Many men on the field today, with gifts of healing, could do the same thing. Many men out here, people speaking in tongues, people prophesying, a gift, could use it for the Kingdom of God, but they don't do it. They take... And God blesses them, anyhow, gets the permissive will. But for popularity, and pleasures, personal gains, sold their birthrights, as Esau did, see, sold out to a organization. Sold out, like Balaam did. See? So many are doing today the same thing. We know that's right. They sell out their birthright. Huh! Women professing the Holy Ghost, wearing shorts; man permitting them in the pulpits, bobbed-haired women in the pulpits; paint on their face, with religious gowns on. The biggest stumbling block the church has ever had. [Numbers 22:2-26]\n\nL-168 If you want to know, in political powers, what time it is in the kingdom age, see where the Jews are. Watch how the Jews are, because they are a nation. If you want to know where the nations are standing, watch the Jews. If you want to know where the church is standing, watch the women. Watch the morals among the women, 'cause she's a representation of the church. When you see the pollution amongst the women, you find the pollution in the church. What she become, a painted-up Jezebel, just exactly what the church has become. See? Now, that's the truth, and you know that. See? If you want to know where the church is, watch the morals among your women. Cause, she is, the church is a woman. If you want to know the national status, watch the Jews. [II Kings 9:30]\n\nL-169 Notice, as God said to Balaam, after he had heard the true-cut decision, Word, \"Don't go.\" Yes, then He told him, after He seen in his--in his heart, what it was to do; He give him His permissive will, so He said, \"Go.\" [Numbers 22:12-20]\n\nL-170 And you can do the same thing. If you don't want to walk in the Truth, you can go and have--have a great ministry. Certainly, you can. But you're taking His permissive will. You're walking over His Word. He'll prosper you, certainly. The... Just like He did Balaam. He was a success, but he couldn't curse that people. He couldn't do it. Cause, every time he started to curse, he blessed. See, he couldn't do it. But when he come to being prosperous in his achievement, he taught those people, through Balak, to commit adultery. He brought in the camp of Israel and married them off, said, \"Why, we are all one. Why, you've worshipped the same God. We got a prophet up here; and you got a prophet down there. And we have the same sacrifice, the same Jehovah as our fathers. Now, why not you all just come and associate with us?\" The Bible said, \"Don't join yourself up amongst unbelievers. Don't yoke up with them, at all. If they don't believe It, stay away from them.\" See? \"Come out, be separate,\" saith the Lord, \"and I'll receive you.\" See? \"Touch not their unclean things.\" That's right. Their filth against the Word, and things like that, stay away from it. Don't listen to it. [II Corinthians 6:14-17], [Numbers 22:12-20] 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min\n\nL-171 And here we find out that Balaam went down there and he begin to teach the people, and he had an error. And he--he run in the way of Balaam, how that he did, and taught Balak, and the children of Israel committed adultery. And a plague struck the nation of Israel, the people, and thousands of them died in one day. And while they were all there, before the altar of God, praying, here come an Israelite man with a Midianite woman, a denominational woman, and went into the tent. And the priest's son walked over there, and took a javelin and killed them both. And that stayed God's wrath. You know that's the Scripture. It that right? See? [Numbers 22:12-21], [Numbers 25:1-14]\n\nL-172 But what happened? Balaam, he succeeded in weakening Israel. What did he do? He weakened their camp. God let him go and weaken their camp, and it polluted the whole camp. And when some doctrine starts, that's not the Bible Truth, it pollutes the whole camp. Somebody raise up with a different idea, like Korah, and say, \"Well, this, that, and the other, and I got a different idea,\" it pollutes the whole camp. And that's what's done the whole church camp today. That's right. [Revelation 2:14], [Jude 1:11-12]\n\nL-173 Teaching as he did, weakening the whole camp for Kadesh-barnea, the Word showdown. When they got to Kadesh-barnea, then, the weakening of the camp. They come back. They had went right after... Remember, they had eat angels' food. They had the Word of God, every night, made manifest. And they eat the food. They drink from the rock. They did all, seen the miracles. They watched Moses, and seen his word, seen his prophesies, everything. And then finally when they listened to this false teacher, come in among them and teach wrong, he weakened the camp, and prospered by it. He might have built a million-dollar buildings. He might have had great denominations. He might have added thousands times thousands, and done great works, and mighty works, and was a prophet. That's alright, but, as long as it's not with the Word of God, you better stay away from it. God don't change His mind. Stay right with His Word, 'cause that's what's going to come out in the end, the Word, Word by Word. \"Whosoever shall take one Word away from It, or add one word to It!\" It's got to stay, that Word. [Revelation 2:14]\n\nL-174 Now listen closely now. When the Word test came, when they went over and seen the opposition so great, the greatest opposition they ever seen, the Amalekites was--was ten times their size. They said, \"We look like grasshoppers. Their fences, or their cities are so walled till they can run a chariot race around it, two chariots, as hard as they can go, around the walls, see, of their cities. Why, their spears are way out, they're long. And they're giants. Why, we look like grasshoppers. We can't do it.\" And two men stood on that Word, Caleb and Joshua, said, \"Wait a minute! You two million people shut up just a minute. We are more than able to do it. See, we are more than a match for them.\" What was they basing on? God said, \"I've given you the land. It's yours.\" And there they stood. But the people had gotten married off, amongst other things, and all kinds of creeds and rituals among them, and they just weaky, wishy-washy, didn't know which a way to turn and what to do. That's right. There come the Word test. [Numbers 13:31-32], [Numbers 22:2-20], [Numbers 25:1-14]\n\nL-175 Yet, He grants you permission for to make, permit your will, a permissive will, knowing that... What's in your heart, He knows it. You say, \"Well, Brother Branham, I do so-and-so. It don't bother me. God blesses me every day. I sing in the Spirit. I dance in the Spirit. I...\" He'll permit it. Go ahead. That's right. But what are you going to do? [Numbers 22:2-26]\n\nL-176 \"I wear shorts, and I do this. It don't bother me. I know my faith is in Christ, not in what I wear.\" But, the Bible said there is something to it. See? What'll you do? You'll make a stumbling block, like Balaam did, before every one of the other women. What'll you do to your young girls? You'll have a bunch of Rickettas, that's exactly right, a bunch of little painted-up Jezebels. See? [Numbers 22:2-26]\n\nL-177 But God will prosper you. \"Why, He blesses me.\" I don't doubt that. He blessed Balaam, too. See? Certainly He will. You'll walk in His permissive will, not His perfect will. God doesn't change His mind, 'cause He blesses you. 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min He blessed Israel right out there for forty years. What did they do? Married wives, raised families, kissed the children, paid their tithes, lived right out there. And the God blessed them in the wilderness, fed them with the manna, on and on. And every one of them perished, 'cause they never kept His original, permissive... His original will, His Word. They took His permissive way. [Numbers 22:2-26], [John 6:49], [Numbers 14:24-39], [Numbers 32:10-15], [Deuteronomy 8:2-5], [Joshua 5:6-7]\n\nL-178 Go ahead, but, you remember, when they left Kadesh, they never journeyed any farther. They just went around and around, in the wilderness. Where, they could have been out, in two days after that, they could been in the promised land. They journeyed forty years, and every one of them died but Joshua and Caleb, the ones that stayed on the original Word. [Deuteronomy 8:2-5], [Numbers 14:24-39]\n\nL-179 O God, help us. God don't change His will. He don't change His mind, but He'll bless you. Sure, He blessed Balaam. And what did he do down there? He polluted the whole camp. See, you have to stay on what He said. He never changed His original plan. [Numbers 22:2-26]\n\nL-180 Now look at the Balaam's today, in the field, would you. Just look around. Prospering, speaking in tongues, sure, using God's gift to gain, everything, sure. But it defiles the whole church of God with their corrupt teaching. That's right. One said to me, he said, \"What you doing this for? What you doing that for?\" I said, \"Don't you believe that That's the Truth?\" [Numbers 22:2-26], [I Corinthians 13:1-4]\n\nL-181 \"Oh, yes. But,\" he said, \"you know what? That's not your business. You're to pray for the sick. They believe you to be a prophet. Why, you could teach them women how to, and them man, how to do this, that, the other.\" \"How can you teach them algebra when they won't even learn their ABC's? Huh? Huh? How can you teach them them things when they won't even take their primer?\" See? You've got to come back and start where you began, or where you left off, and take every Word of God. [Luke 4:4], [Proverbs 30:5]\n\nL-182 Just look at it in the field today. As Balaam married into God's church, a harlot, married the harlot into God's church, so is these false teachers today trying to tell you. They're going to marry every one of these organizations and these people into the old harlot of Revelation 17. Their Balaam doctrine going around today, and say, \"We're just the same. We're all Christians.\" And priests and popes, and whatevermore, all compromising and doing this. [Numbers 25:1-15], [Numbers 22:2-26], [Revelation 17:1-18]\n\nL-183 The preacher said... Even I know a Pentecostal preacher, all of them, started now giving a round kosher. Which means, Ashtoreth, the \"moon-god,\" a kosher wafer. Say, \"Shut your eyes and take it, if it hurts your conscience.\" Shut your eyes? A round wafer, what does it mean? We are taking a broken body, Jesus Christ, broken; not a round moon-god, Ashtoreth, who Mary took the place of. And the Roman kosher is still round, for the moon-god, goddess, not god. We have a broken kosher, certainly. Oh!\n\nL-184 So now the great harlot of Revelations 17, these Balaam teachers with their false doctrine, is marrying the church into that kind of a mess. Watch when it comes to the showdown at the end time, look the weakness of it now. Nine hundred and something different organizations, one pulling one way, and one the other. There is no unity among them. And they're trying to bring unity; not backed by the Word of God, God's original plan. They are taking it in by a politics and an organization. God don't change His mind. He stays right with His Word. He said, \"Heavens and earth will pass away, but My Word won't.\" That's right. He stays with His original Word. Oh, my! [Matthew 24:35], [Revelation 17:1-8]\n\nL-185 Though they still reason against It, just like they did, and just... There is only one thing to do. He won't change It. Just believe. Because, both heavens and earth will pass away; His Word will never fail. See? [Matthew 24:35]\n\nL-186 You see where you're getting married into? See the politics and things, how they're trying to join the church together by a politics in the church? We are not joined to Christ by politics. We are joined, the Church, to Christ, by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And the way you know the baptism of the Holy Ghost, is 'cause that Spirit in you identifies every Word of God to be the Truth. That's right. \"For whosoever shall take 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min one Word out of It, or add one word to It, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.\" [Revelation 22:19], [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-187 Yet, \"He prospers,\" you say. You can't believe That by prosperity. You can't judge God by prosperity. The world prospers. Balaam prospered by it. But, brother, you judge God by His Word. He keeps His Word and identifies It the Truth. So, remember, friend, as long as you live, don't you never forget this: God doesn't change His mind. Yet, He will bless. He will let you go His permissive will, but He won't change His mind. He won't change His plan. He won't change His Word, for you. No, sir. You've got to change. You can't have God's Word to match your experience; you've got to have your experience to match God's Word. See? That's the way you've got... You say, \"Well, I'm a good man. God does this, that, or the other.\" But do you keep His Word? \"Oh, well, I tell you, that ain't just... Naw.\" All right, there is something wrong somewhere. God's going... Yes, He'll prosper you. Sure, He'll make you... [Numbers 22:2-26], [Matthew 24:35], [Proverbs 30:5-6], [John 6:49], [Numbers 14:24-39]\n\nL-188 The denominations is prospering to who wouldn't have it! They spread their tents, the great, fine churches, and everything, throughout the land. They're rich, and money pouring in, and members from everywhere. Didn't the Bible say, \"There was found in her even riches of the world, and even souls of man,\" and everything, that was found in this old harlot, which is the mother of the whole thing, politics and organization? [Numbers 22:2-26], [Revelation 17:1-6]\n\nL-189 But God's little group is His Bride, centered on that Word. May the dear Heavenly Father ever keep you stabilized right there. Don't you never move from that Word. You may bless, you may... God may heal your sick. He may heal your sick baby. He may heal your husband, your wife. He may heal your mother, somebody else. You may jump at His Spirit, and dance up-and-down. Remember, the rain falls on the just and the unjust, just the same. But when that seed is laying there, it's either ordained or it's not ordained. And if it's ordained, it can... If it's a wheat, it has to bring forth wheat. If it's a Word of God, it has to produce the Word of God. If it isn't, well, then it isn't. See? You get that now? [Matthew 24:35]\n\nL-190 The Lord bless you. Here I told you I was going to quit at nine o'clock, and here it is, twenty minutes till ten. Many of you people, a long ways to go. I love you. And the reason I hold you like this, is not because I want to be cruel to you, but I love you. And what I know, I don't keep nothing back; I tell you the Truth.\n\nL-191 Out in the meetings where I go, you never hear me preach these Messages. No, I promised you, to come to this tabernacle. Right here is where I preach my Messages from. I've got three or four more here, that the Lord has given me, I've got the Scriptures on it, that I would be daresn't to preach it anywhere else but right here. Here is where the Word of God started going from. And, till God changes it, I'm staying right here and bringing it out right here. That's right. Out yonder in the meetings, I pray for the sick, and everything like that; and, on the side, say things in a roundabout way, that the sheep hear It. They know what it's talking about. Otherwise, it's just the bait on the hook, you see. I show the signs of--of trying to show that God knows, in discernment, and knows the hearts of the people, and does these things. That's an evangelistic gift, just to stir the people. The first thing you know, a tape drops into their house. That's got it, then. If he's a sheep, he comes right with It. If he's a goat, he kicks the tape out. Uh-huh. [Brother Ben Bryant says, \"And you, too.\"--Ed.] You see, that's... \"And you, too,\" is right, Ben. That, that's exactly right. Ben has had some experience. All right. Well, that's right.\n\nL-192 Aren't you glad that you're His? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Aren't you glad? [\"Amen.\"] We used to sing a little pentecostal song, a long time, like: I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out; I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out; If it had not been for Jesus, where would I be? I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out. Oh, I been happy since the Lord brought me out; I been happy since the Lord brought me out; If it had not been for Jesus, where would I be? 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min I'm so glad since the Lord brought me out. I been shouting since the Lord brought me out; I been shouting since the Lord brought me out; If it had not been for Jesus, oh, where would I be? I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out. Glory! Aren't you glad? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] \"Aren't you glad...\" Let's sing it. Aren't you glad that the Lord brought you out? Aren't you glad that the Lord brought you out? If it had not been for Jesus, oh, where would I be? I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out. Well, I been singing since the Lord brought me out; I been singing since the Lord brought me out; If it had not been for Jesus, oh, where would I be? I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out. Aren't you glad of it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Then, we'll walk in the Light. You know that song? We'll walk in the Light, It's a beautiful Light, Comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us by day and by night, Oh, Jesus, the Light of the world. Don't you like that? Let's sing it again. We'll walk in the Light, It's a beautiful Light, Comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us by day and by night, Oh, Jesus, the Light of the world. It's sunup! All ye saints of Light proclaim, Jesus, the Light of the world; Truth and mercy in His Name, Jesus, the Light of... Now let's raise our hands when we sing it. Oh, we'll walk in this Light, It's such a beautiful Light, It comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. Shake one another's hand. Oh, It comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright. Aren't you glad you're children of the Light? The Son is up. ... all around us by day and by night, \"Ye little children, love one another.\" ... the Light of the world. Oh, we'll just walk in the Light, It's such a beauti-... (manifestation of His Word) Comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright, Just shine all around us by day and by night, It's Jesus, the Light of the world. You all believe it? We're marching to Zion, The beautiful, beautiful Zion; 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min We're marching upward to Zion, That beautiful City of God. Oh, we're marching to Zion, Beautiful, beautiful Zion; We're marching upward to Zion, That beautiful City of God. Let those refuse to sing Who never knew our God; But children of the Heavenly King, And but children of the Heavenly King, And may speak their joys abroad, May speak their joys abroad. For we're marching... (Glory!) The beautiful, beautiful Zion; We're marching upward to Zion, That beautiful City of God. Oh, we're marching to Zion, Oh, beautiful, beautiful Zion; We're marching upward to Zion, That beautiful City of God.\n\nL-193 Get your handkerchief out. Take out your handkerchiefs, just a minute. Let's give the Lord a wave offering. It ain't a sheaf, but they took from the body of Paul handkerchiefs and things, see. Oh, we're marching to Zion, Oh, beautiful, beautiful Zion; We're marching upward to Zion, That beautiful City of God. Oh, we're marching to Zion, Oh, beautiful, beautiful Zion; We're marching upward to Zion, That beautiful City of God.\n\nL-194 Amen! Oh, don't it make you feel good? I can just imagine those old saints back there, before going into the Roman circus there, start walking up that hill, you know, up that little ramp, going up into the lions' den, saying: Oh, we are marching to Zion, This beautiful, beautiful Zion; We're marching upward to Zion, That beautiful City of God. The fields of Zion yields A thousand sacred sweets Before we reach the Heavenly Throne, Before we reach the Heavenly Throne, Or walk the golden streets, Or walk the golden streets. We're marching to Zion, It's beautiful, beautiful Zion; We're marching upward to Zion, That beautiful City of God.\n\nL-195 Repeat after me. Lord God, [Congregation says, \"Lord God,\"--Ed.] I pledge myself anew to You. [\"I pledge 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min myself anew to You.\"] Cleanse me from all unrighteousness. [\"Cleanse me from all unrighteousness.\"] Cleanse me from all doubt in Thy Word. [\"Cleanse me from all doubt in Thy Word.\"] Let me, from this Easter, [\"Let me, from this Easter,\"] be a new creature [\"be a new creature\"] in Christ Jesus. [\"in Christ Jesus.\"] Let me bear, in my heart, [\"Let me bear, in my heart,\"] Your Word. [\"Your Word.\"] May It be a Lamp to my feet [\"May it be a Lamp to my feet\"] that will Light my path. [\"that will Light my path.\"] From henceforth, [\"From henceforth\"'] I will follow You. [\"I will follow You.\"] In Jesus' Name. [\"In Jesus' Name.\"] Amen. [\"Amen.\"] We're marching to Zion, Oh, beautiful, beautiful Zion; We're marching upward to Zion, That beautiful city of God.\n\nL-196 Don't that make you feel good? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] We have pledged ourself anew, knowing that in our hearts we have been quickened from the dead, made alive. Don't it make you feel good? [\"Amen.\"] My, oh, my! I love you, with undying love. Listen. \"Love one another. For you cannot dislike your brother, who you see, and say you love God, Who you haven't seen.\" See? So just love one another. Then, you serve one another, you serve God. Is that right? \"As you do unto the least of these that's got quickening Power in them, you've done it unto Me.\" \"When did we see You in need? When did we visit You in prison? When did we do these things?\" \"What you done to them, you did it to Me.\"\n\nL-197 Isn't that wonderful? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] I love Him, don't you? [\"Amen.\"]\n\nL-198 Oh, there is one more song we have to sing, if you just got a minute more time. Oh, well, we'll just take them. All right. All right, sir. Oh! Take The Name Of Jesus With You. Don't forget that, friends. Let's all sing it now. Each one, together now, just with one big heart, take it to Him. Let's, with all we got in us. Take the Name of Jesus with you, Child of sorrow and of woe; It will joy and comfort give you, Take it everywhere you go. Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven; Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven.\n\nL-199 Remember now, pray for me when the hot persecution winds are blowing, when devils on every side is challenging, I'll remember you're praying for me night or day, and I'll be praying for you. Stand by your good pastor, Brother Neville, and the associate, Brother Capps. Listen to them. They'll teach you the Word of Life. I believe that. If I didn't believe it, I certainly wouldn't have them here. I certainly would not. I believe that they believe the Message, and they stay with it to the best of their knowledge, and I've got faith in both man. Stay with them. These other brothers, around where they got their meeting, that stood here tonight, if you're around their neighborhood, stand by them. You heard what they come here for, tonight. Take the Name of Jesus with you, As a shield from every snare; (listen at this) When temptations round you gather, Just breathe that holy Name in prayer. Precious Name, precious Name, O how sweet!O how sweet! Hope of... Dear God, heal these people. I pray Thee, Father, in Jesus' Name. Grant it, Lord, I pray. ... O how sweet! 65-0418E, Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 132 min Hope of earth and joy of Heaven. Till we meet! till we meet! Till we meet at Jesus' feet; Till we meet! till we meet! God be with you till we meet again. Let's bow our heads now. [Brother Branham begins humming God Be With You--Ed.]O God, be with us. Help us, Lord. ... we meet at Jesus' feet! (till we meet!) Till we meet! till we meet! God be with you till we meet again.\n\nL-200 That's truly my prayer. Till we meet again, God bless you! And now I'm going to ask our precious Brother Neville if he'll dismiss this fine congregation. God love you, each one. I'm so thankful to have people like you all. What would my Message be if I had nobody that believed It? And there is people here, you would die for It, for this Message we got. May God help you, each one. My prayers are with you. My blessings go with each one of you. May you not forget that you're a part in that resurrection. The quickening Power is now in you. It's all settled. You're God's child. Let's bow our heads, until Brother Neville dismisses. And God bless you. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

Lord, as we gather here this fine Easter morning, see the little buds pressing their way out, the bees flying in and getting their portion, the birds singing like their hearts would burst with joy, because there is an Easter. We believe that You raised up Jesus from the dead, many years ago, today, and we celebrate this memorial day.\n\nL-2 And let there come an Easter among us all, today. May we, as His servants, understand His Word, that we were in His fellowship then, and that now that we are risen with Him and setting together in Heavenly places.\n\nL-3 Bless the service here in the tabernacle, and across the lands where it goes, by this telephone.\n\nL-4 Heal all the sick and the afflicted. May it be an Easter for them, also, and an exodus from sickness unto strength. And those who are dead in sin and trespass, may they live today through Christ. And we'll praise Thee, for we ask it in His Name. Amen.\n\nL-5 I certainly deem this a marvelous privilege, this morning to be back here in Jeffersonville, Indiana, with this great congregation, the church packed and standing, and around and outside, and in the lots and everywhere. To you people on the phones across the nation, it's a beautiful morning here.\n\nL-6 Five o'clock this morning, my little friend with a red breast flew up at the window and woke me up. Seemed like his little heart would burst, saying, \"He is risen.\" I've always thought of this little bird as being a friend to me, because I like him.\n\nL-7 As the legend about him says, \"A little brown bird saw Him suffering on the cross, where sin had placed Him.\" Of course, the little bird had no sin. He didn't have to die for the little bird. \"But he flew into the cross and tried to pull the nails out, with his little beak, and he got his breast all red.\" And that's the way I want mine, too, as a shield, of trying to protect this glorious Thing that He died for.\n\nL-8 Realizing that our time is limited here, especially for those friends who are listening in by this telephone, I would like to call your attention this morning to a--a picture that sometime ago was taken by the camera, of a vision that I had here at the tabernacle, of leaving Indiana, to Arizona; where I was to meet, in the form of a pyramid, seven Angels. Not knowing what would happen later, when I got there, thinking it was the end of my life, that no one could stand the blast; and I'm sure all of you are acquainted with the story. And then in Sabino Canyon, one morning like this, while in prayer, there had been a sword placed in my hand, and said, \"This is the Word, and the Sword of the Word.\"\n\nL-9 Later, the Angels appeared as was prophesied. And at the same time, a great cluster of Light left where I was standing, and moved thirty miles high in the air, and around the circle, like the wings of the Angels, and drawed into the skies a shape of a pyramid in the same constellation of Angels that appeared.\n\nL-10 Science took the picture, all the way from Mexico, as it moved from northern Arizona, where the Holy Spirit said I would be standing, \"forty miles northeast of Tucson.\" And it went into the air, and Life magazine packed the pictures, \"A mystic something way in the spheres, where there could be no moisture, where there could be no evaporations of anything; thirty miles high, and twenty-seven miles across,\" and coming right up from where those Angels were.\n\nL-11 Now, they asked, to know. Science, the one of them in Tucson, wanted to know any significance, but I didn't tell them. You all knew it, told beforehand. But it wasn't for them; it was for you.\n\nL-12 And so there He spoke to me, and said, \"The Seven Seals will be opened. The seven mysteries, seven-fold mystery of the Bible, that's been closed up since the foundation of the world, will be revealed.\" And we, yet a humble little group, compared with all the world, we've enjoyed these blessings, a hearing those mysteries. Marriage, divorce, serpent's seed, all these different questions, has been completely revealed to us, not by man, but by God, Himself, that's opened those seven mysteries; of what the Church was, how It was in Christ at the beginning, and how It would be revealed in the last day. [Revelation 10:1-7] 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min\n\nL-13 And now, as this went up, we have the picture outside on the plaque. But, then, I have the picture laying present here, if you notice, as Life magazine had it. But I wonder if my audience, visible here, has ever really looked at the picture, see, see, in the way it should be.\n\nL-14 You remember, I was preaching when this vision came, upon the subject of the Book of the Revelations, where the old judges, where we seen Jesus in Revelations 1. When we started to open the Seven Seals... or the--or the Church Ages, rather, just prior to the opening of the Seven Seals. Christ was standing with \"hair like wool, white.\" And I described that to you, that the old English judges, and judges of long ago, when they went to the bench, to be sworn in, their supreme authority was given them. They wore a white wig, as it was, over their heads, to show their supreme authority. [Revelation 1:14]\n\nL-15 Well, if you'll turn the picture like this and look, you can probably see it from the audience, it's Christ. See His eyes looking here, just as perfect as it could be; wearing the white wig of Supreme Deity and Judge of all heavens and earth. Can you see His eyes, nose, His mouth? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Just turn the picture from this, the way they had it; this a way, the way it's supposed to be. And you... Can you see it? [\"Amen.\"] He is Supreme Judge. There is none other but Him. And that is a perfect identification again, a vindication that this Message is the Truth. This is the Truth. It is true. And making Him not a third Person, but the only Person! [Revelation 1:14]\n\nL-16 With the white, see, you see the dark, His face, His beard, and His eyes. And notice, He is looking... From Him comes this Light shining on the righthand side, to which He's looking to. And on the cross, that's where He looked, to the right, where He pardoned the sinner. In the Light of His resurrection, we still go forth in His Name.\n\nL-17 I wish, this morning, that I had just much time to--to spend upon these phenomena that's beyond any shadow of doubt, been proven for the past thirty years, or thirty-five years, right here at this church; since down on the river, when that same Light came down here in Jeffersonville, in 1933, and spoke those words, \"As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ, your Message will forerun the second.\" We're at the end time, and we see it. We wonder sometimes why it hasn't spread over the earth; maybe sometime we'll have a chance to explain that, if God willing.\n\nL-18 Now I want you to turn in--in your Bibles, as we always believe that the Word must come first, of the reading of the Word. I always read That, because It... My words is the word of a man, it will fail; but the Word of God can never fail.\n\nL-19 Now we're going to--to read from the Holy Scriptures, a text. And we want you to turn, first, to three places in the Bible, that I have chosen to read from. One of them is in Revelations, the 1st chapter, and the 17th and 18th verse; this is where He appeared with \"His hair white as wool; and His feet was like brass.\" And then I want you also to get, in your Bibles, Romans 8:11. I have chosen, this morning, three places to read, from the Holy Scriptures, for my Message today, that the Lord has placed upon my heart for the resurrection. And then I want you to, also, Mark 16:1 and 2. There I will draw my--my context.\n\nL-20 Now in Revelations 1:18, we read these Words, 17 and 18. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; for I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of death and hell. [Revelation 1:17-18]\n\nL-21 And in Romans the 8th chapter and the 11th verse, we read this. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-22 And now in Mark the 16th chapter, the chapter of the resurrection, the 16th chapter, the 1st and 2nd verses. And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, the mother... and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had brought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min the sun. [Mark 16:1-2]\n\nL-23 Now, my text this morning, I want to take for a text: It Is The Rising Of The Sun. And for a subject, I want to use, \"the quickening Power.\"\n\nL-24 Now, you know, you perhaps have been hearing the radio and the different ministers speak. And our noble Brother Neville this morning speaking his Easter subject, on the resurrection. And I thought maybe I would take it a--a little different path, not to be different, but just to add a little more, maybe in another angle, for you. The Scriptures, every angle you go with the Scriptures, It always declares Jesus Christ. You cannot get away from it, any way. It always declares Him.\n\nL-25 Now, as the world today in a--a memorial service, or, at least, in United States and this side of the earth, this morning, in the churches and throughout, is celebrating a memorial of--of the greatest triumph that man ever had.\n\nL-26 I think, as Saviour when He died, or as an infant when He was born, He could not have been here lest being coming into the earth. And when He died, certainly He atoned for our sin. But, yet, there's been many fine little babies born, and there's been many man who has suffered and died for a real cause, but there never was one that could raise hisself up again until this day. [Romans 5:11]\n\nL-27 Now, that it is the greatest week in history, the greatest celebration of all times, this Easter is where He proved what He had said. Man can say things, but yet it isn't exactly can be believed upon, thoroughly, until it's been proved to be the Truth. And as God, Who said, \"Prove all things; hold fast to that which is good,\" He would not tell you to do something that He would not do Himself. So He proved Who this was that died for our sin. [I Thessalonians 5:21]\n\nL-28 And, now, not only is it a memorial day, of all these great Easter flowers, and Easter bonnets, and pink rabbits, and so forth, that we've got into, and holy celebration; which is all right, but this is not the real thing in that way.\n\nL-29 As people today are trying to say, \"We should wash feet once a year, on--on Thursday, and on Friday we should take the communion,\" and all different doctrines of... They argue about whether it should be this day or that day, or whether it should be a sabbath day or the first day of the week; or... All these things are just merely tradition. What good would any of it do you, whether you had Lent or not Lent, if there is no Life in you? It's only a memorial. Which, there's nothing against it, but they have certainly carried out their traditions, but left off the main thing.\n\nL-30 Satan doesn't care how religious you are, or how right you are in your Doctrine. If you miss that Life, you won't come up, anyhow. No matter how religious, how good, how many churches you've belonged to or will belong to, it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again. [I Corinthians 13:1-2]\n\nL-31 Therefore, if God raised up Jesus from the dead, did He raise Him up for a memorial? And is this resurrection morning only a--a one day in the year, or a certain day that we celebrate this? Or, are we benefactors of His resurrection? What does it mean to me? What does it mean to you? Now we believe, by faith, that He raised from the dead, but what has that got to do with me? That was two thousand years ago. Now to find this text! [Romans 8:10-12]\n\nL-32 As I was tired, my arm hurting me, from shots that the nurse gave me. For, leave overseas now, as you know, in a few days, and I must have these shots, son and I. And with cholera, yellow fever, and everything, I was pretty weary, making me sick. Which, Caesar requires to have these shots before you go into the other nation. And He said, \"Give Caesar that which is Caesar's, but then give God that which is God's.\" [Matthew 22:22], [Luke 20:25], [Mark 12:17]\n\nL-33 And as I was setting there, wondering what would I speak to this waiting audience this morning; which I am very thankful for, and man and women who would lay their life on the line for what you would say. \"How should I do it? What should I take for a text?\"\n\nL-34 And then while I was setting there, almost asleep, my door rattled, out on the front side of the house. Nobody being there but myself, as far as I knew. I listened. I didn't get it just right. After a while, the den room door, where I turn into my study, it rattled, and someone kept shaking the door. And I--I went to the door and opened the door, and, to my surprise, a--a pretty, little, yellow-haired, blue-eyed girl stood there, looked like a little Easter flower; that's 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min setting here looking at me now.\n\nL-35 She handed me a card. And it was the... Course, I guess when I get home there'll be Easter cards, and so forth; but the only one, being leaving home, that I had received. And she said, \"Brother Branham, this is from daddy and me.\" She wanted to be sure that \"me\" was in it. And her arthritic father, setting in a wheel chair, had sent this card. When I took it and thanked the little darling, as she turned and walked away from the door, I opened up the card.\n\nL-36 And in the form of this card I drew my text. For, on the card was the Saint Mark 16:1 and 2, sunup, the sun was rising. Then I thought of that, and then the subject of \"the quickening,\" of Jesus Christ to be raised up from the dead, I drew my subject.\n\nL-37 Now, the sun, at the rising of the sun. Well, there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness. It was without form, and was void. And it was all covered with water, and was laying there in the dark, dismal, gloomy atmosphere. And the Spirit of God moved upon that water, and said, \"Let there be light.\" God had a reason to do that, for down beneath that water there was seeds that He had planted, and it had to have that sunlight to make it live. [Genesis 1:1-5]\n\nL-38 And the first Light was ever given in the earth was God's spoken Word. The first Light that ever struck the earth was God's spoken Word. He said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. That turned darkness into light, in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth. Then, the Spirit of God, as It moved with love and compassion, at that great day, the first day of the dawn of creation upon the earth; the sun rose and swept across, its rays, and dried up the waters from the earth, and made an atmosphere above. And, for its first time, it was to bring joy and life to the earth, by a seed. That was a great hour. [Genesis 1:1-8]\n\nL-39 But, oh, it wasn't nothing, that sunrise, like the sunrise on that Easter morning. This time, with the sun leaping into the skies, it brought forth a greater sunrise than ever; because it came greater news with this sunrise, than it did with the sunrise at the beginning. This sunrise brought a news, that, \"He is risen! He is quickened from the dead, as He's promised. He's risen from the dead.\" [Mark 16:5-8]\n\nL-40 The first time the sun rose, in Genesis, it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the earth, mortal life. [Genesis 1:3-5]\n\nL-41 But this time, when the sun rose, there was a--a dual sunrising; another, Son, rising. It was the... not only s-u-n rising, it was the S-o-n had risen to bring Eternal Life to all God's promised Seed that by foreknowledge He had seen laying upon the earth. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-42 No more could the--the botany life lived back there at the beginning without the s-u-n to bring it to life; no more than, today, when sons of God is upon the earth, it takes the S-o-n Light to bring them to Eternal Life, His chosen ones that He knew before the foundation of the world. He had chosen them in Himself before the foundation of the world. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-43 And on Easter morning, then, in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time, for we are the dust of the earth. And in Heaven, there was a Book of memory, and His attributes was in Him, knowing that because this Son of God raised, It would also raise to Life every son that was foreordained to this great time. He knew it would be. And what a more glorious sunrise that was than it was at the beginning, at time when it first dawned. Now, on this great breaking of the Easter Seal! [Romans 8:11], [I Thessalonians 4:14]\n\nL-44 Now, today we have a tuberculosis, Easter seal. People sends a message, one to the other, and to support this great fund or drive, for the doctors and medical science to work upon something, to retard or to help the tuberculosis. They are seal, what we call an Easter seal, when we send message one to another. But when we receive the message, that seal is broken, because the seal is what's got a message bound on the inside.\n\nL-45 And now, the true Easter Seal, on this sunrise, was broken; and the secret, of Life after death, was revealed. Before that time, we didn't know. The world grouped in darkness, groped around, man's suspicion. Theories was among man's heart, tradition made up. Man worshiped idols. They worshiped the sun. They worshiped all kinds of gods. And all kinds of people that made claims, they all went into the grave, and they stayed in the grave. 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min\n\nL-46 But the real Seal had been broken, and One Who once lived as we live, died as we will die, was risen from the dead. What a morning! Never one like it, in all the history of the world. The secret was made known that He was both resurrection and the Life. [John 11:25]\n\nL-47 And He said, when He come forth on that morning, \"Because I live, you live also.\" Not only was He the beneficiary of the resurrection, but all those Seed that was resting in God's great promise was a benefactor of that resurrection to Life. Because, He said, \"Because I live, ye shall live also.\" That was the breaking of the Seal. Because He was brought up, so will every one that's in Christ be brought up with Him. [John 14:19]\n\nL-48 At this glorious sunrise, God had proven, or vindicated, His Word. All the glooms and doubt that had moved in people's minds was taken away, because here was He Who once lived, eat, drink, and fellowship with mankind, that said, \"I have power to lay My life down; I have power to raise it up again.\" And now not only had He made the statement, but He proved it to be the Truth. Oh, what a glorious thing that is! [John 10:17-18]\n\nL-49 I'm sure this morning that even we, who believe it, cannot comprehend what a great thing that was. Because He raised from the dead, we also have already raised from the dead, for we were in Him. [I Thessalonians 4:14], [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-50 Notice now. As the gloom covered the earth, and the seeds could not live without the s-u-n to rise, and gloom had covered the earth. And now the S-o-n was risen, and all gloom was vanished by this Light, as It spread across the nations, to the people, that, \"He is not here, but He has risen!\" What a--what a statement! He had proved His Word. He had proved It be, to be true, for He had now conquered death, hell, and the grave. [Matthew 28:6]\n\nL-51 The trinity of the devil; death, hell, and the grave; for Satan is the author of death, he is the possessor of hell, and also the grave. And that was the trinity of Satan, being caused by one thing, that was death. Death, you go at the grave; and being a sinner, you go to hell. All the very one thing, the trinity of Satan, which was death. That had held man in captivity all these years. [Revelation 1:18], [Psalms 49:14-15], [Hosea 13:14]\n\nL-52 But now the true trinity of God, being One manifested in Christ, Who was Life, and had broke the Seals and conquered the enemy, and rose up, the one true and living God. \"I am He that was dead, and I'm alive forevermore, and have the keys of death and hell.\" God, in One, made Man, and dwelt among us, and conquered every enemy. And had proved that the trinity of Satan was conquered, and that the trinity of God was made known, 'cause only God alone had power to bring Life back again. He was that Emmanuel. God had been manifested in the flesh. [Revelation 1:17-18]\n\nL-53 No wonder He could claim there, Matthew the 27th chapter, \"All powers in Heaven and earth is given into My hand. I send you to be My witnesses, to all the world.\" He had conquered both death, hell, and the grave. Not only did He do that; and come out, triumph, with all the power in Heavens and the earth. All that was the Father, all that was the Holy Ghost, and all that there ever was, was in Him. \"All powers in Heaven and in earth is given unto Me.\" Everything else is powerless. He had conquered it. [Matthew 28:18]\n\nL-54 Now! And then, not only that, He sent Word to His disciples, His believing. \"Fear not, for I am He that was dead, and is alive again forevermore. And I have the keys to death and hell; I've already conquered it. Don't fear anymore, for every foreordained, predestinated Seed of God shall come to Life when that Light spreads across the earth, of the glorious Gospel. In every age, It'll bring forth the crop that God ordained It to do.\" He had raised from the dead. [Revelation 1:18]\n\nL-55 Oh, what a wonderful thing that is, \"I am alive, or quickened.\" The word means, the word quickened, the Greek word means that's something that's \"made alive after death.\" [Revelation 1:18]\n\nL-56 Like the--the seed that goes into the earth, it has to die, every bit of the seed. It has to rot, every bit of the seed. And every bit of the life, that was in the seed, has to come forth again. [John 12:24]\n\nL-57 He was \"quickened.\" Not only that. \"And will send the same Life that quickened Me, the Power that brought Me from the grave, I will send It upon you, to quicken you, that where I am there ye will be also.\" [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-58 In Luke, 24th chapter, 49th verse. He said, \"Behold, I send the promise of the Father upon you; but tarry ye, or 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min wait ye, in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with Power from on High.\" To show that not only did He draw all the benefits out of it, but He shared those benefits. [Luke 24:49]\n\nL-59 He come to redeem, or to bring to Life, those predestinated Seed that God seen before the foundation of the world and put their names in the Book of Life. And here they are on the earth, without a hope; He came not only to be the Blessing, but to share the Blessing with every predestinated Seed. Now, if the Seed wasn't on the earth, it could not live. It had to be on the earth, and also germitized. No matter how long It's kept in darkness, It'll come forth when the S-o-n shines upon It. Notice now, He come to share It with us. [Revelation 5:9-10], [Titus 2:13-14]\n\nL-60 No wonder the Gospel is good news. The very word Gospel means \"the good news.\" The good news, what? If a man died for our sake, that's good news. If Christ was born, that's good news. But never a news, never was there news like this news, that, He Who made the promise has confirmed the promise. Then, \"He's alive forevermore, and have the keys of both death and hell, in His hand.\" All the gloom was shook away. There was no more gloom to be seen, for the Son was up from the grave. There was no, \"Well, He will come, or He may come.\" He had already come, the Gospel, good news! [Revelation 1:18]\n\nL-61 Notice, the very Message of the Gospel, Itself, is to prove to the people that He is risen. \"Go tell My disciples that I am risen from the dead, and I'll meet with them, to confirm this to them.\" O God, how in this last day there shall be Light again across the earth! \"And I'll prove to My disciples! Go tell them that I am not dead, and I'm not a tradition, but I am a living Christ. I'll meet them. Take this Message to My disciples, that I am risen from the dead,\" the Gospel, good news. You say, \"Is that right?\" [Matthew 28:8-11]\n\nL-62 Hebrews 13:8 said, \"He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" We, His beneficiaries, are to prove His Life is in us now, the beneficiaries of this Life. The Life, there never was a life lived like it; He was the Son of God. And He died, and that shut it out; but when He raised again from the dead, on Easter morning, then we, as His servants, are commissioned by Him to go into all the world and to bring this good news to every person, that He is a living. And how can we do it by Word only? For it is written, \"The Gospel came not by Word only, but through the power and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit, to prove that He is alive.\" [Hebrews 13:8], [I Thessalonians 1:5]\n\nL-63 Now, if there is another gospel, as Paul spoke to one of the groups, \"I am so surprised that you turned to another gospel.\" Which there is no other, but a make-belief gospel, to a denominational fiction, turning from that good news. [Galatians 1:6-7]\n\nL-64 \"And because I live, ye live also. And I live in you, and the works that I do,\" John 14:12, \"the works that I do will identify Myself in you.\" What a Message! No wonder, we've had a dark world of theology, but in the evening time there shall come Light again. There will be a resurrection in the evening time. It shall be Light at the evening time. [John 14:12], [John 14:19]\n\nL-65 Now, the very essence of the Message that was sent, that, \"He is risen from the dead,\" we His beneficiaries, we who share the resurrection with Him, draw benefits from this, by proving to the world that He is alive. We cannot do it by word only. We cannot do it by some tradition of man. We only reflect exactly what we're pointing to. [Matthew 28:5-11]\n\nL-66 I'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to Christ. We're getting them to a church, to a theory. But we must get them to Christ. He is the only One, and the only One that has Life. \"He that has the Son has Life.\" [John 3:32-36]\n\nL-67 And if the life of a man that's dead be projected in you, you will live the same life he lived. [Romans 8:11] If the blood of a man was a certain type, and you took the blood from one man and changed the blood of the one man into another, he would absolutely be that typed blood.\n\nL-68 And if your spirit that's in you is reckoned dead, and you are anointed with the Life that was in Christ, is upon you! Romans 8:11 said, \"If the Spirit that raised Christ from the dead, dwells in you, It also quickens your mortal body,\" that same Life, them same powers, them same beneficiaries, that He had here on earth, from God. He redeemed you, a Seed 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min that was foreknown by God, whose names was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-69 And that Gospel Light of the resurrection, the confirmation of the Word! How did we know He was the Christ? Because He proved what He talked about. How will I know the Message of the hour? God proves what He promised, and He talks about it. That is the identification, that we are beneficiaries with Him in the resurrection. He proves what He has talked about. [Isaiah 9:2]\n\nL-70 What He promised to do in Christ, He proved on the resurrection. What He promised to do in the days of Moses, He proved it. What He promised in the days of Enoch, He proved it. In all the days of the apostles, He proved it.\n\nL-71 Now in this day, He proves what He said, because they are a part of that Seed that was represented on the Book of Life that He came to redeem back to God again. Oh, what a Message!\n\nL-72 On Easter morning, not only did He raise, but His beneficiaries raised with Him. He... They were in Christ at His crucifixion. They were in Him at His resurrection. We are His beneficiaries, quickened after being dead in darkness. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-73 The darkened world of unbelief, where churches and denominations, and so forth, had drawed us out. And there's something in us calling, \"Oh, we want God! We're hungering and thirsting for God.\" We joined the Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostals, Presbyterians, and whatmore, and still there was something wrong, we just couldn't find It yet. And all of a sudden, while we was groping in darkness, the great resurrection came to us in the manifestation of the promised Word of God. [Psalms 42:1-5, 7, 11]\n\nL-74 Like, He was the manifestation of the promised Word of God. \"I will not leave His soul in hell, neither will I suffer My holy One to see corruption.\" He manifested It, every Word of God that was promised to Him. He proved it when He raised on the Easter morning. [Psalms 16:10]\n\nL-75 Now, them who were once groping in darkness and wondering around, if they should wash feet on this day, or if they should keep a certain day, or do a certain set of rules, all those things passed away. For, there was a glorious resurrection that defied every man-made thing that man had ever done, every man-made reason.\n\nL-76 There had never been, to that time, a man that could lay his life down and pick it up again. He defied that scientific proof they had, by raising again.\n\nL-77 When they say, that, \"Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday, today, and forever,\" that, \"His Power isn't the same,\" that, \"His Gospel isn't the same,\" when the Bible says It's the same! God defied every denomination, every creed, and He moved forth with His Holy Spirit, as He promised, and proved it to us, that He is alive. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-78 We are the benefactors of His resurrection, quickened after being dead in the world, in sin and trespasses. \"He has quickened us together with Him, raised with Him, now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\" His bring... [Ephesians 1:3]\n\nL-79 His Spirit brings His same Life again on the earth. \"If the Spirit of God, that raised up Christ,\" the body, the anointed body; if the Spirit of God anointed that body in such a way that, when that Seed fell into the earth, He just wouldn't let Him rest there. No. He quickened Him and raised Him up. \"That same Spirit,\" by the same works, by the same Power, by the same signs, \"be in you, It'll also raise you up.\" [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-80 I'd like to read a little Scripture here for you. I'd like for you to turn to another Scripture I got wrote down here. It might help you a little. It's found in the Book of Leviticus, the 23rd chapter, the 9th to the 11th verse. Listen close. In the law, Levitical law, God speaking to Moses. Listen. All these things are types now, and we'll stop here for a few moments to get into this type. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When you... come into the land which I give unto you,... [Leviticus 23:9-11] 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min\n\nL-81 \"Unto the place, the position, that I have given unto you. Now you speak to the children of Israel, that when you get to this certain place that I've promised you I'd take you, when you get there in this land.\" Now speaking natural here, typing the spiritual. ... and shall reap the harvest thereof (you have received what I told you thereof), then you shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. [Leviticus 23:9-11]\n\nL-82 If there would be any holy ritual, it should come forth on the sabbath day, which was the seventh day of the week, which is Saturday. But did you notice, in this memorial, to wave it on the first day of the week?\n\nL-83 \"The sheaf, which was the first of your seed that you planted, when it comes up and ripened, you cut down this sheaf and take it to the priest. And let him take it and wave it before the Lord, for your acception, that you are accepted. You have come with your sheaf, and he is to wave it before the Lord, on...\" [Leviticus 23:10-11]\n\nL-84 Not on the sabbath, the seventh day; but on the first day, which we call Sunday, S-u-n-d-a-y.\n\nL-85 Course, that's a--a Roman word, which they called it the sun day for the sun god. But how it is changed!\n\nL-86 It's not s-u-n anymore. It's the S-o-n d-a-y, the Son day, that that corn of Wheat (God's first One up from the dead) is to be waved over the congregation, that we are His Seed; and that's the first of the Seed of those that slept, waved upon the first day of the week. On Sunday, He raised up. Waved good-bye, and ascended up on High, in the presence of the people. [Leviticus 23:10-11]\n\nL-87 Notice, It was the first corn of God's Wheat that had been raised from the dead, God's first corn of Wheat. By God's quickening Power, God had quickened His life, raised Him up from the dead, and He was the Firstfruits of those that slept, the Firstfruit. He was that Sheaf. [Leviticus 23:10-11]\n\nL-88 That's why they had to wave that sheaf, for it was the first one that come to maturity. And it was waved as a memorial of thanksgiving to God, believing that the rest of them would come. It was a sign.\n\nL-89 And, today, because He was the first Son of God to come to full maturity, to be in God, He was plucked up from the earth and is waved over the people. Oh, what a glorious lesson! By the quickening Power, the first One! Although, He had--He had been typed; and many times, as we'll see later, that He was typed. But this was really the Firstfruit of them that slept. He was waved over the promised Seed that had promise of Life. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-90 He was waved at the Day of Pentecost, \"when there came a sound from Heaven like a waving, mighty rushing wind,\" and was waved over the people, the pentecostal people that was up at Pentecost, waiting for the Blessing to come. [Acts 2:2]\n\nL-91 And to be waved again, we realize, in the last day, according to Luke 17:30, in the Son day again, \"in the day that the S-o-n of man will be revealed,\" or waved again over the people. [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-92 Now, Who is the Son of man? \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\" And if all the teaching that we have, and confirmation of the Word of God; by Word of God, by signs, by wonders, we see today, that in the Book of--of Luke here, that as we just quoted from, or the--the Luke the 17th chapter and the 30th verse; and Malachi 4, and the different Scriptures that we are acquainted with, that that Word again is waved over the people, that the dead traditions of man is dead, and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right among us, and is giving us Life. [John 1:1]\n\nL-93 As Christ was the first One to raise, from all the prophets, and so forth; although typed in many places, He was the Firstfruits of those that slept. In the Bride, coming of Christ, coming out of the church, there'll have to be a Sheaf waved again in the last days. Oh, my! [Colossians 1:15]\n\nL-94 Waving of the sheaf! What was the sheaf? The first one that come to mature, the first one that proved it was a wheat, that proved it was a sheaf. [Colossians 1:15], [Leviticus 22:10-11]\n\nL-95 Hallelujah! I'm sure you see what I'm talking about. It was waved over the people. And the first time there will 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min come forth, for the Bride age, for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism, will be a Message, that the full maturity of the Word has turned back again in Its full Power, and being waved over the people, by the same signs and wonders that He did back there.\n\nL-96 \"Because I live, ye live also,\" speaking to His Wife. \"Because I live, ye live also.\" What a resurrection that that was! And what a resurrection this is, to be quickened from the dead, \"to be made alive in Christ Jesus,\" by God's quickening Power. [John 14:19]\n\nL-97 He was waved to them. The Word, which He was, was waved back to them on the Day of Pentecost, the Word made manifest. Now, and as I say, It's to be waved again in the last day. Now, for instance...\n\nL-98 You say, \"Well, now, wait a minute, Brother Branham. I know a church that...\" Well, I do, too. See?\n\nL-99 But now, for instance, what if--if we were going to go back to Tucson this afternoon, now, and each one of us had a... was going to go in a--a big Cadillac, brand new? And all of the seats were made out of--of doeskin, softest of the leather, soft and easy to sit in; and the floorboards were plush; the steering wheel were nickel-plated and had diamond studs all over it; and the engine was mechanically tested to be exactly the right engine; and the wheels were... all had bearings and greased up; and the tires were all puncture-proof and blowout-free; and all been tested scientifically.\n\nL-100 They had been pushed off the assembly line, both of them, and both of them filled up with gasoline. That's the running power, the gasoline, because in it is the octane. But now when you're going to start them, although both of them look just alike, but there is one of them don't have any spark, any firing power.\n\nL-101 \"Well,\" you say, \"the power is in the gasoline, Brother Branham.\" But I don't care how much power is in the gasoline; unless there's a spark there to manifest that power, 'less there's a power there to confirm that that's gasoline, it just might as well be water. Until...\n\nL-102 No matter how much theologians claim, how well you got your church set, how much education you got, how much like the Bible; until that wave Sheaf, until the Holy Spirit comes upon that person to quicken that Word! The gasoline represents the Word. It's the Truth; but, without the Spirit, It won't move. [John 1:12]\n\nL-103 We have put too much stress on the Mechanics and nothing on the Dynamic. It needs the dynamic Power of God, the resurrection Power of Jesus Christ upon the Church, to manifest and to bring to pass that This is gasoline. It might be in a gasoline can; could still be water, see. But the only proof of it, is, put this Life on it, and It'll prove whether it's gasoline or not. [Luke 24:49], [John 6:63]\n\nL-104 And when you try to put the Holy Spirit in a denomination, you are as much as trying... You can get a splutter; you'll ruin your engine, by getting it full of carbon.\n\nL-105 But, oh, I'm so glad that there is a ten thousand octane Power, the Word of God and a Holy Ghost to light It up, and to resurrect the Power of God into a man's life, or a woman's life, or into a church. That shoved that Cadillac down the road yonder, under the dynamic Power of the Holy Ghost which came back and was waved over the people at the Day of Pentecost, making Him the same yesterday, today, and forever. [Acts 2:38], [Hebrews 13:8], [John 6:63]\n\nL-106 There was the first Sheaf come up from all the prophets, which was the Son of God, the King of all prophets. [Colossians 1:15]\n\nL-107 There has been churches, churches, brides, brides, churches, brides, brides. But there has got to come One! Hallelujah! There has to come a real Bride! There must come One that's not only got the Mechanics, but the Dynamics of It, makes that Church live, move in the Power of His resurrection. Until we come to that place, until we find that place, what good does it do to polish the hubs? What good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonize job, when there's no Dynamics in it? No matter how much the Mechanics prove to be right, there has got to be a Dynamics to make It work. [John 1:12], [Romans 8:11], [Luke 24:49], [John 6:63]\n\nL-108 That's what He proved! Hallelujah! That's what Easter proved. He wasn't only the Word, but He was God Himself, the Dynamics, in the Word. That made the body of Jesus Christ (cold, stiff, and dead, in the grave) shake into Life and rise again, and roll away the stone. \"I am He that was dead,\" so dead till the sun said He was dead, the moon said He 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min was dead, the stars said He was dead. All nature said He was dead. And now the whole world has to recognize that He's alive again. He was not only the Mechanics, God's Word, He was the Dynamics to prove It. [Revelation 1:18], [Romans 8:11], [John 6:63]\n\nL-109 And as He, being the Groom, the Bride has to come forth, 'cause It's part of Him. And It can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride; It can only manifest. If it does something different from the Groom, it isn't the Bride. Because, She is flesh of His flesh, bone of His bone; Life of His Life, Power of His Power! She is Him! As man and woman are one, and woman taken from his side; She had taken a Spirit, the feminish Spirit, from Him. The flesh from His side, made both Mechanics and Dynamics, the Wife. The Spirit of Him and the flesh of Him, and put it together, and made Mechanics and Dynamics. Until the church or the people... [Genesis 2:23], [John 6:63]\n\nL-110 All these Easter bunnies, and ceremonies, and big churches, and finery, will fail and pass away.\n\nL-111 Until that Church becomes both Dynamics and Mechanics; and the Spirit of God, that moved Him, to do the things that He did! If He hit on sixteen cylinders, so will the Bride. Amen! For He said, in John 14:12, \"He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also. I'll give him a charge of My Dynamics, in his Mechanics, that the world will not be able to withstand it; and I'll raise him up again at the last day.\" That's the Easter Message, the Dynamics and the Mechanics, together! The Mechanics without the Dynamics, no good; neither is the Dynamics, without the Mechanics. [John 14:12], [John 6:63]\n\nL-112 You can scream and shout, and jump up-and-down, all you want to, and deny this Word, it won't do any good. You're just cranking around the--the pistons of... Got the spark there to fire, but no gasoline to fire it by. [John 6:63]\n\nL-113 It'll only work as they come together. Amen! So, one will set still, and the other One will go up. That's the only thing there is to it. Yet, they both might look alike, both claim to be churches, both claim to be Bride. But One has Mechanics and Dynamics, It brings it to pass, of what He said is the Truth. [John 6:63]\n\nL-114 It just won't move, no matter how good the Mechanics is, until the Dynamics come. When the Dynamics come, that Fire is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline. And when That explodes, it causes a combustion, and that combustion moves every motion, every move, for He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. That's the resurrection. That's the real Power of God, Mechanics with the Dynamics. Notice, \"It's the Spirit that quickens.\" It's the--it's the Spark that fires. It's not the gas that fires; it's the Spark that fires the gas. See? [John 6:63], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-115 \"You can do nothing without Me; but with Me you can do all things.\" As He is the Word, It's the Father living. \"Father sent Me, so send I you. As the Father has fired Me and pushed Me into everything, I do only that which is pleasing to God. Now, as He sent Me, so send I you with the same Mechanics, and it takes the same Dynamics to operate It. And these signs shall follow them that claim to have the Mechanics. The Dynamics will take Its place.\" [John 20:21-22], [John 15:5]\n\nL-116 Paul said, \"The Gospel came to us not in Word only,\" through gasoline only, \"but through Spark also,\" to make It move. There you are. It came to us in that manner. [I Thessalonians 1:5]\n\nL-117 It's the same Spirit, that raised Him up, that quickened the true believer to Eternal Life. Now remember, potentially... Now watch, as we are getting out of our time. Notice, \"the same Spirit,\" now, Romans 8:1. Now let's just read that again, in Romans 8:1, and we'll see what that says. All right. And not Romans... I mean, 8:11, I'm sorry. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-118 In Romans 8:11, \"But if...\" There is the problem. There's His catch. But if the Spirit of him (God, the Holy Spirit) that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you,... [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-119 Now, there you are, \"If the Bridegroom Spirit dwells in the Bride!\" [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-120 When God made His first bridegroom, He made the bridegroom first, and he was both man and woman, in spirit; formed him in the dust of the earth, to make him material. And notice when He made Eve, from Adam, He took not another piece of clay, He took from the same piece of clay; the same Word, for Adam was a spoken Word. See? He 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min took from him, and then taken the... He had masculine and feminish spirit. And He took the feminish spirit away from Adam, and placed it in Eve; so it's still part of Adam's spirit, it's Adam's flesh. Then, it was Adam's spirit, the dynamic, that quickened the mechanics of his body. [Genesis 1:27]\n\nL-121 So the Bride must also be flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone. Then how is this mortal flesh going to become His flesh? We'll get to it in a minute, see. How is it done? How? What is this great transformation? Notice. Now if the Spirit of him (God) that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. [Genesis 2:23], [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-122 Oh, my! The predestinated One, of course, like the Seed laid upon the earth, the One that had Life in them. Many of them were dead; they were just rotten seed; the waters and things burnt them out. But, you know, there was a Seed laying there ready for Life. God knowed It was laying there. [Romans 8:11, 30]\n\nL-123 Now, the predestinated Ones are the first to be quickened by the Holy Spirit, for the Holy Spirit comes to claim Its Own. Now, this is deep now, and be sure to catch this good. [Romans 8:11, 30]\n\nL-124 Now, as the sun was sent across the earth, not to bring rocks, which was dirt also, to life, it was not to bring all the dirt to life, but was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around a life.\n\nL-125 Not all man will receive Christ. Oh, no. But those which God foreordained Life, is housed around some of the dirt of the earth, that's the One He comes to quicken. They're the Ones. [Romans 8:28-30]\n\nL-126 That, now, that dirt would lay there in the sun, and say, \"Oh, this old sun is so hot!\" That rock, say, \"This old sun is so hot!\" But that little seed, said, \"That's what I'm looking for,\" and it begin to spring forth to life. It quickened that part of the dirt. Because, the sun was sent not to quicken the rock, not to quicken the dirt, but to quicken the life of the seed.\n\nL-127 Now, the Holy Spirit comes now. Of course, It wasn't sent... Why won't all the people receive It? It wasn't sent to them.\n\nL-128 A guy told me, \"I don't believe. I don't care what you'd say. If you could raise up the dead, or anything, and heal the sick; and prove It, any way; I still don't believe It.\" I said, \"Certainly not. You're a unbeliever. It don't mean a thing to you. It wasn't even sent to you. It's sent to those who will believe.\"\n\nL-129 The Message is to the believer. To them that perish, It's foolishness; but to them that are in Christ, and part of that Seed, It's Life. [I Corinthians 1:23]\n\nL-130 My crude little story about the farmer putting the egg under, or the eagle egg under the hen. See? That little eagle was, absolutely, he was a--he was a odd-looking, little creature. When this farmer had did that thing that he did, to put this eagle egg under this old hen. And she hatched out a funny-looking chicken, and it was a--it was a odd, little fellow. He didn't look like them. His feathers wasn't like the rest of them, and he--he just... He was an odd, little guy. And all the rest the chickens recognized him an odd fellow. And the hen went around...\n\nL-131 He didn't even like the diet she was feeding him. He just didn't like that scratching in the barnyard. He, he didn't have nothing to do with that. So he wondered why he had to be the odd one around there, anyhow. See? And he never tasted anything that... He just eat enough to keep him alive, because he didn't like the taste of it, see. Cause, he wasn't a chicken, to begin with. See?\n\nL-132 And the--the hen would cluck, and, you know, \"The days of miracles is past. There is no such a thing. Join the church.\" It just didn't hit right, with the little guy. So he followed around the hen until one day his mammy...\n\nL-133 The old eagle knowed she had laid so many eggs, and there was one missing. She knew that that eagle was somewhere, so she starts out on the hunt for him. And she circled over the mountaintop, and down in the valleys, and over in everywhere where he might be. By this time, he, it's time for him to be born. It's time for him to be hatched out. Said, \"Maybe a crow come in and picked up my egg; maybe a vulture. I don't know. Something picked up my egg. But I know... That egg is in my mind. I got a son somewhere. I got to hunt him.\" 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min\n\nL-134 So does God. He is that Great Eagle. In His thoughts He knowed He'd have a Church. He knowed He'd have a people. No matter what's cuddled them, no matter what they was hatched out under, He is hunting. He is hunting for His Own.\n\nL-135 And one day, the story goes, this old eagle flew over the barnyard. She was looking everywhere, and she found him. Oh, for that resurrection, to recognize that he really wasn't a chicken, after all. He was an eagle! And he was always taught to look down, look for a bug or something in the barnyard. But he heard a scream, that said, \"Look up this way!\" And he looked above him, and there was a creature with fourteen-feet wings, powerful-er than all the chickens there was in the barnyard, and claimed him to be her son. He said, \"Mama, how can I get to you?\"\n\nL-136 Said, \"Just jump, start flopping your wings, for you're an eagle.\" See, she knew she had a son somewhere. No matter what he's been raised up in, she's got a son somewhere.\n\nL-137 And God knows! Hallelujah! He's got a predestinated, foreordained Church! He knowed He's got sons and daughters, and a Bride, waiting somewhere; when the Holy Spirit begins to fly over it, that wave Sheaf. Oh, my! He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Not some mythical story, but a reality! [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-138 No matter how many tried to tell him, \"a eagle,\" he didn't know what a eagle was. Yet, he was a eagle. He would not understood it until he seen something that reflected him, that he reflected, rather. [Romans 8:11, 30], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-139 And when we see, not a denomination, not a Ph.D., not a LL.D., not a good neighbor; but a son of God molded in the image of God, with the dynamic Power of God to answer the request of this day, that He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, there ain't no hen going to hold you. He hunts for his Mama. He's an eagle, to begin with. He recognizes. This real eagle recognizes the call of God's Word. Why? He's an eagle. A eagle to a eagle! The Word before the foundation, the Word to the Word! The Word, predestinated, to the Word written for the hour. You realize your position. He hunts for It. [Romans 8:11, 29-30]\n\nL-140 This then, this earthly body, is quickened and brought by the quickening Spirit of God to obedience to the Word of God. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-141 Quickly. When he wanted to know how he could get there with her, he had been taught he couldn't do that. \"You can't get no higher than you can jump.\" He's a chicken. See? But this eagle said, \"That's not so.\" \"Well, look at the chickens!\"\n\nL-142 \"No matter what the chickens are, you're a eagle. Just start spreading those wings, and get a little exercise in them. Start moving up!\"\n\nL-143 The Word to the Word! \"The works that I do shall you also. He that believeth in Me, the works that I do shall he also.\" See? \"Because I live, he lives also.\" \"And if the Spirit that raised Him from the dead dwells in you, It quickens your mortal body.\" See? [John 14:12, 19-20], [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-144 What does It do? Now listen, so that you'll know. And this Easter, I want it to mean more to you than any Easter ever did. See? I want you to see it. We know what It done for Him; but I want you to see it, not will, It has done the same for you. See? What does It do? It quickens the mortal body. This mortal body that we live in, It quickens it, in other words, brings it to Life. [Romans 8:11], [John 14:12, 19-20]\n\nL-145 Now, you who once walked along with a great big cigar in your mouth, and everything, or a bunch of cigarettes; and you women who once had short hair, painted, and carried on, and wore shorts, and things like that; all at once, Something screamed, and you looked down here and It was the Word. See, It quickened your... You said, \"No more shorts for me, no more liquor for me, no more lying, no more stealing, no more this, that.\" See? The Spirit that raised Him from the dead, dwelling in you, will also bring your mortal bodies, the dust of the earth, into subjection. You see? What is it? Subjection to what? Christ. Who is Christ? The Word. Not the theology, but the Word! [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-146 Then you say, that, \"These things, oh, I think it's all right for women to wear slacks.\" [Deuteronomy 22:5] 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min When, the Word said, \"No.\" See, It quickens you to That. See? You are drawed to It. See, it's you, then. It becomes... You become part of the Word. It brought your body, not... [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-147 Well, you say, \"Well, now, let me tell you something. My pastor...\" I don't care what your pastor said; it's what the Word says! If you want to be a chicken, go on with him. But if the pastor speaks different from this Word, then he is not a feeder of the eagles; uh-huh, he's a feeder of the hens, see, not of the eagles. See? The Eagle eats on eagle's Food. See? It quickens!\n\nL-148 The Bible said it's wrong to do that, and the man and so forth and what all you do, it's wrong. Say, \"Days of miracles is past.\" This Bible said He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. If they say, \"That's mental telepathy. And it's some kind of a mind-reading, this discernment. And all these visions and things, is nonsense,\" see, they are chickens. They don't know what eagle Food is. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-149 But, brother, when you hear that scream, there's Something in you! You're a eagle, to begin with. Why? You are that Seed, that the resurrection of the S-o-n has dawned, and the wave Sheaf upon the earth, to make you recognize that you are a eagle and not a denominational chicken. You see it? Hah!\n\nL-150 \"If the Spirit that raised Him from the dead,\" the Word, the Dynamic of the Word, \"dwells in you, It also quickens your mortal body.\" Now how we flesh of His flesh and bone of His bone? Because, quickly, while we're yet mortal sinners, mortal, ready to die, these bodies, It quickens that body. What's quicken? \"Brings to Life.\" The spirit that once liked to drink, run around, commit adultery, and all these, it's quickened; why, the thing died, and you are resurrected. It quickens your mortal body. [Romans 8:10-12]\n\nL-151 Therefore, your bodies is the temple of the Dynamics, because (why?) from the beginning you are part of the Mechanics. Oh! There is your resurrection. There is the Church in the resurrection, with Him. These bodies right now are quickened. See, you've heard; you believe. It changed you from a denomination to the Word. See? [Ephesians 2:20-22]\n\nL-152 The Dynamics, if It comes upon water, it'll just splutter; \"Days of miracles is past.\" Pomp-pomp-pomp, \"Oh, I believe the Bible,\" pomp-pomp-pomp, \"but there--there ain't no...\" Pomp-pomp-pomp! See?\n\nL-153 But when He hits that one thousand octane, \"Whrrrrr,\" away she goes, you see. How, my, the Dynamics strike That! But It strike a chicken, it won't do no good. But when It strikes the eagle, he moves out. Amen! The Dynamics with the Mechanics! See what I mean? That is, if he is a true eagle now, he will \"understand.\"\n\nL-154 Let me straighten a little Scripture here for you. I think we're off of the phone, but we are still here. Saint John 5:24, Jesus said, \"He that heareth My Word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life.\" Now look, I go down the street and just take that literally, what It is, without the spiritual understanding... Not making It say nothing else, but just saying what It says, see, the right word there, in the Greek, in the original, it says, \"He that understandeth My Word.\" [John 5:24]\n\nL-155 Now, to prove that's right. I go down here, and here's a drunk coming along the street, and with some other man's wife on his arms, and cussing, and taking God's Name in vain, and everything else like that. \"Say, did you hear what that preacher said? Did you?\" \"Yeah, I heard It!\" That don't mean he's got Eternal Life. See? See? \"He that understandeth My Word,\" he that is an eagle! \"Now, Brother Branham, I want more Scripture than that.\" All right, \"My sheep hear My Voice. A stranger they won't follow.\" [John 10:4-5]\n\nL-156 As in the Marriage And Divorce case, the other day. When the Holy Spirit had told me that, I come said it just the way He told me.\n\nL-157 Some minister lady give me a right sharp, little bawling out. She said, \"I guess you take the place of God?\" I said, \"No, ma'am.\" Said, \"Well, you told them their sin is forgiven.\" Said, \"Where?\" Said, \"Only God has power.\" See, another Pharisee. See?...?... 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min\n\nL-158 I said, \"You see, that you might know, that, Jesus told Peter and the apostles, after he had the revelation of Who He was.\" He told Him, \"Thou art Christ, the Son of God.\" [Matthew 16:16]\n\nL-159 He said, \"Blessed art thou,\" see, \"son of Jonas; flesh and blood never revealed This to you, but My Father which is in Heaven has revealed It. Upon this rock I'll build My Church; the gates of hell can't prevail against It. And I give unto thee the keys; whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind it in Heaven; what you loose on earth...\" [Matthew 16:17]\n\nL-160 That's that Divine revelation of the Word made flesh. If It was flesh in that day by the Son, the Groom, It's the flesh today by the Bride. See? \"Whosesoever sins you remit, to them they are remitted; whosesoever sins you retain, to them they are retained.\" [John 20:23]\n\nL-161 Now, the Catholic church picked that up and takes it to their priests, but that's carnal.\n\nL-162 Watch, it was the spiritual, revealed Word that did it!\n\nL-163 That's the reason He told them to go baptize in \"Name\" of Father, Son, Holy Ghost. He knowed they knew Who He was. [Matthew 28:20], [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-164 Talking to a little preacher the other day, he said to me, he said, \"Now, Brother Branham, I've come out and joined, went over to a certain-certain church, a Pentecostal church.\"\n\nL-165 Where, the Pentecostal now has started taking the round wafer, you know. You've heard of that, I guess; the kosher, the moon-god, you know. And they all accepted it and taking it. This man said... His--his congregation went to him; he said, \"What I bless is blessed.\" Now, ain't that what the priest says, he \"has power to turn it back to the body of Christ\"? See, just six of one and half a dozen of the other, just the same.\n\nL-166 And he said, \"I want to ask you something.\" He was trying to dodge that issue of the baptism in Jesus' Name, because this was the man that said it was--it was the antichrist that did that. He said, \"Do you think it's all necessary that a man should be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ?\" I said, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nL-167 He said, \"After he's been baptized in name of 'Father, Son, and Holy Ghost'?\" I said, \"Yes, sir. He hasn't been baptized, at all. See? He hasn't been baptized, at all; no Name. That's a title.\" I said, \"It isn't recognized.\" I said, \"Why did--why did Peter...\" He said, \"Well, now, let me tell you something.\" He said, \"Now, in Acts 10:49, he said, 'While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell upon them.'\" [Acts 10:44] \"But,\" I said, \"he turned right around and said, 'Can a man forbid water that these should not be baptized?'\" [Acts 10:47-48]\n\nL-168 He said, \"Well, you was speaking over there, a while ago, about Acts 19, where Paul passed through the upper coasts of Ephesus, find them disciples.\" And said, \"Why,\" said, \"they wasn't baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\" [Acts 19:1]\n\nL-169 I said, \"No, they were baptized 'unto repentance,' not for remission of sins. 'Unto repentance,' 'cause Jesus hadn't been made known yet. The Sacrifice hadn't been killed.\" [Matthew 3:11] He said, \"Well, why did they have to be baptized over?\" [Acts 19:2-5]\n\nL-170 I said, \"The man that had the keys, said this, 'For be it known unto you that there is not another Name under Heaven given among men, whereby ye must be saved.'\" [Acts 4:12]\n\nL-171 Salvation alone goes in the Name of Jesus Christ. \"Whatever you do in word or deed, do it all in the Name of Jesus Christ.\" There is not another name, no church, no hierarchy, no titles, or nothing else! Yet, He is the Rose of Sharon, Lily of the Valley, Morning Star, Alpha, Omega, Beginning and the Ending, Jehovah-jireh, -rapha, -manasseh, all these. He is all these things, but yet He... There is not no salvation in any of those titles; Jehovah, no salvation; Rose of Sharon, yet He is, no salvation; Father, Son, or Holy Ghost, no salvation. Only the Name of \"Jesus Christ!\" And then the Bible said, that, \"Repentance and remission of sin must be taught in His Name, beginning at Jerusalem, and to the 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min uttermost parts of the earth.\" He said, \"Do you think it makes any difference?\" [Colossians 3:17], [Colossians 3:17], [Revelation 22:16], [Revelation 1:8], [Luke 24:47]\n\nL-172 I said, \"Sir, I want to ask you something.\" He and I, and my wife, were setting at the table. He just moved over,...?... I said, \"We are both Arizonans; we live here. And I, and we know our council, and our ward, and all, and our mayor, governor, everything.\" He said, \"Yes.\"\n\nL-173 I said, \"Now, if I told you, brother, to, 'Go over here and sign up for our dinner, in the name of the Governor of the State of Arizona,' would you go sign it like that? Do you think they would receive it at the desk?\"\n\nL-174 \"Why,\" he said, \"I guess not.\" He said, \"Why did Jesus say that?\"\n\nL-175 I said, \"This is it, see. Why? If I told you to 'go sign for this dinner, in the name of the Governor of the State of Arizona,' and us being citizens of Arizona, and knowing who the Governor is, why, you would know to sign it in the name of 'Sam Goddard,' see.\" I said, \"Because, he is the Governor of the state. I don't have to question you. You know who the Governor is. And, when He said, 'Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,' He knowed how they was going to baptize. They knowed Who He was. 'My sheep hear My Voice.' See? See?\" He said, \"Oh, I see.\"\n\nL-176 But now, the next thing, will you believe? See? \"He that heareth My Word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life.\" And when this new Eternal Life dwells in you, It is the potential. [John 5:24]\n\nL-177 When you have received this Holy Spirit now, that they did at Pentecost; they were the mechanics, now the Dynamics had to come. They had believed. You know, our good Baptist friends tells us, \"When we believe, we've got It.\" But, they didn't have It, yet they had believed. [Acts 19:2-5]\n\nL-178 Acts 19, they had believed, but they didn't have It. \"Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?\" See? They had the Mechanics, alright, because the apostles were... Or, I mean, Apollos was teaching to them and proving by the Bible, the Mechanics, that Jesus was the Christ, but they didn't have the Dynamics yet. See? That's it. All right. [Acts 19:2]\n\nL-179 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... -chanics, you potentially have the earnest, the waiting.\n\nL-180 Now, when you get the Dynamics, you have been quickened from mortal to immortality. It makes the whole body come subject to the Word. It'll make you act different, look different, live different. It'll just make you different.\n\nL-181 Now look. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... been quickened. \"You who were once dead in sin and trespasses, and darkness, has He quickened.\" What by? \"His Spirit that raised up Jesus,\" on Easter morning, \"from the dead. And if It dwells in your mortal bodies,\" now watch, \"It also quickens, brings to Life, makes it subject to the Word.\" [Ephesians 2:1], [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-182 Now, how can you claim to have that Spirit, and throw yourself away from the Word? You're quickened by something else. For, It will quicken your mortal bodies to the Word. Sure, It will.\n\nL-183 You can't run without It. You'll just sputter, if you don't believe all of It. If you have part gasoline and part water, you ain't going to go nowhere. See? You've got to take it one hundred percent, gasoline. If you don't, you backfire, and you ain't got no power. See? \"But I--I believe this, but I don't believe That,\" pomp-pomp-pomp- pomp. You ain't going nowhere.\n\nL-184 But, oh, when you take the fullness! Let it light up on that, every Word is Truth!\n\nL-185 Then notice now, as we close, notice this. Notice, it's just like a little--a little seed laying in the ground.\n\nL-186 Now, potentially, you are resurrected. You're resurrected when you receive the Holy Spirit in you. You're resurrected right then. Your body is potentially resurrected. [Romans 8:11], [Ephesians 1:13-14]\n\nL-187 Look at a little seed. Plant it in the ground. It has to drink from His fountain, the waters that pours down. And as it drinks, it pushes up towards Him, coming more like the likeness of the seed that went into the ground. See? 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min\n\nL-188 The Church come that way, through justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, now in the blossom. See? The Spirit of God come through that.\n\nL-189 And the spirit of the world has come through the antichrist, the same way, and now blossoming out in a great union of churches, see, the whole thing.\n\nL-190 And the individual comes that way. Everything works on the same, on the same scale of God, 'cause He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Notice, on your way, growing to the fullness of the resurrection, led by the Spirit! [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-191 As the sun, s-u-n, pulls that little plant that's drinking from God's fountain, just keeps... See, it can only drink from one thing. You pour oil down on that little seed one time; kill it. That's right. You pour stagnated water, old water that ain't no good, it's contaminated, it'll stunt the growth. It won't bear fruit. Is that right? But you pour real good soft rain water, amen, no man-made chemicals in it, just let it come from the heavens above, and watch that little plant. There is no water will grow that like that rain water. You put chlorine and stuff in it, like you try to dose us up with, and, the first thing you know, it kills the plant.\n\nL-192 That's what's the matter today. They try to give them waters from the denominational fountain, and it stunts the growth. See? But let him have the... Come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around me by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. Then you got it, then. We'll walk in the Light, that beautiful Light, Comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Just shine all around me.\n\nL-193 Take these man-made fountains away from me! No other fount I know; nothing but the Blood of Jesus! That's all the Fountain I want to know. Let the Word dwell in me, Lord; water It with Thy Spirit.\n\nL-194 Notice, now, if that Spirit that raised up Jesus from the grave, dwells in you, you potentially have Life; led by the Spirit, to quicken the Word to you, to believe It. The little thing keeps pushing up as it grows. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-195 Notice, at Pentecost, their bodies were quickened to a new Life. Look at a bunch of little cowards.\n\nL-196 Am I holding you too long? [Congregation says, \"No.\"--Ed.] Look, I'm just warmed up, that's it, feeling good. Oh, my!\n\nL-197 Notice, they were coward. Notice. But, they had the Mechanics. See? But they were all setting back in there, saying, \"Oh, I'm afraid of them. Oh, I'm afraid to go out and make a claim, 'cause, oh, all them great big bishops and things out there. Oh, I'm afraid to. Them priests and things, I'm afraid to make that claim, afraid I'll say I believed on Him. Oh, I just can't do that, you see.\" [Acts 1:13-14]\n\nL-198 But, all of a sudden, the Dynamics come. Yes. And what did It do? It not only filled their spirit, inside, but It quickened their mechanics. Their bodies were quickened. They were no more cowards. They went right out in the face of the people. Yes, sir. \"You men of Judaea, and you that dwell in Jerusalem!\" Where, before the Dynamics come, they were just mechanics. See? \"Ye men that dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known unto you, and hearken to my words! These are not drunk, as you suppose.\" [Acts 2:14-15]\n\nL-199 I'm one of them. This is That! I'll show you what it is. It's the Scripture. This is That! And I've always said, \"If this ain't That, let me keep this till That comes.\"\n\nL-200 \"No, this is That that was spoken of by the prophet Joel, 'and it'll come to pass in the last days, saith God, I'll pour out My Spirit upon all flesh.'\" See, the Dynamics come into the mechanics. They wasn't afraid no more. [Joel 2:28], [Acts 2:17]\n\nL-201 Some of you people that are afraid that some woman will laugh at you for having long hair, or quit wearing 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min makeup; some of you man that's afraid your organization will throw you out when you baptize your congregation in Scriptural baptism; you need to close yourself in the upper room till the Dynamics come. That's right. [I Corinthians 11:5-15]\n\nL-202 It changed them. It quickened them. It made them different. They were a changed people, from then on. It quickened them, from an old life of being a coward, to like the Lion of the tribe of Judah. They absolutely faced martyrdom, nailed to crosses, crucified upside-down, burnt, throwed in the lions' den. No more cowards, about them. Death had no victory over them, at all. The Dynamics was in the mechanics. Yes, sir. It quickened their mortal body. [Acts 2:1-4]\n\nL-203 Now listen. Here is another thing, for proof. It so quickened them in such a way till (you know what?) they was lifted up in Heavenly places, and their mortal bodies was so quickened till their language changed. It only... It quickened their language. That's what the Bible said. And, their mortal bodies being quickened, their language was quickened. Their thoughts were quickened. Their spirits were quickened. Their life were quickened. They were quickened, altogether! They tried to talk, and couldn't talk in any more human languages. They was so quickened up in the Presence of God till they spoke in new tongue, a Heavenly language. Whew! What a quickening Power! [Acts 2:4]\n\nL-204 \"If the Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you,\" oh, hallelujah, \"It will quicken your mortal body.\" It'll make you do things you didn't do before. They was full of quickening Power then. See? [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-205 Your body ain't subject to sin no more; you, your desires. He say, \"Come on out here!\" You say, \"Shut your mouth.\" \"Oh, we got the biggest...\" \"Shut your mouth.\" My, you're a eagle!\n\nL-206 Did you ever see how independent an old eagle walks? He don't hop like a vulture, see, to every dead, and all the carrion laying on the ground. No, sir. He walks proud. \"Shut your mouth.\" \"Oh, here is a good dinner over here.\"\n\nL-207 \"Not for me. See, my desires has changed. My appetite is different. 'For man shall not live on the world a carrion alone, but by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'\" A genuine quickened eagle lives by That. Amen! [Matthew 4:4]\n\nL-208 Oh, and He raised up Christ from the grave, dwelling in you, has quickened your mortal body unto His Presence. You recognize It. You are no longer a scavenger. You're an eagle. You don't want the things of the world. You're a son and daughter of God. You're feasting at a Fountain that the world knows nothing about. You're drinking It. Somebody knows... The world knows nothing about. You're eating hidden Manna that the world never even knowed nothing of It, for you're an eagle. You're quickened up where you can get to It. You can't get to It down here, you got to get up here. You got to be quickened, lifted up there, so It will quicken. [Revelation 2:17], [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-209 What did they do? They spoke in another language. The Bible said they did. \"They spoke in every tongue under Heaven.\" [Acts 2:4-6]\n\nL-210 Could you imagine that, them old mortal bodies that's in there, say, \"Well, I don't know now whether I can believe this or not\"?\n\nL-211 All at once, they were so quickened till the bravery of the Lion of the tribe of Judah fell into them, over that waving Sheaf. Oh, that Eagle come to call Its Own! \"And they loved not their lives unto death.\" Amen. And there is going to be more who will give their life's blood For this Holy Ghost Gospel and Its crimson flood.\n\nL-212 And the Son has got to be--be revealed again, in the Bride in the last day; the quickening Power has got to come, quicken them out of these dead denominations and creeds, to a living Word of the living God. Oh!\n\nL-213 No, It quickened them to new Life. It does the same thing for us now. Notice, then, they was so quickened in that 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min quickening Power! Now I... Listen close now. I'm trying to show you.\n\nL-214 The quickening Power wasn't only in their soul, but It was all over them. It... Not only the Dynamics come in, to quicken, but It quickened the mechanics. You see what I mean? They were so quickened till their tongues begin to speak in another language. They were so quickened by the Power of the resurrection of Christ, until they laid their hands... They were so quickened with quickening Power, till, when they laid their hands upon the sick, they got well. \"It quickened your mortal body.\" They were healed, by laying on their hand. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-215 And the Spirit quickened their fellowship together with God, till they also were so quickened into the Presence of God until, when a person died and their soul had gone off, It called him back to life again. Amen! Glory! Now I'm feeling religious. [Acts 9:36-41], [Acts 20:9-10] That's right, quickened! Not only was His resurrection for Himself, but for whosoever will, to this predestinated Seed that's laying there. Quicken, quickens the mortal body!\n\nL-216 They laid hands on the sick; they recovered. They prayed; in the Spirit they saw vision, call the dead back to life. That's right. \"Quickened their mortal body.\" If It comes into you; if it be so... Now, you can say it's so; but if it be so, these signs follows that, you see. \"It quickens your mortal body.\" It'll quicken you. [Acts 28:8]\n\nL-217 Now, notice, quickening in the Presence of God. Why? It was the Spirit of God that raised up Jesus from the grave. And, the Spirit of God, \"I give unto them Eternal Life,\" come from the Greek word, if you look it up, Zoe, which moves It through you and then quickens (their) even their mind. [John 17:2]\n\nL-218 Now look. How can you say that that Spirit dwells in you? Though you done everything that you thought was right, here is your evidence whether you got It or not. If the Spirit that was in Christ is in you, It also quickens you to the Word, for He is the Word. And if it, contrary, quickens you away from the Word, then it isn't the Spirit of Christ!... care what you done, until That moves you in the Word. \"My sheep hear My Voice, and they shall live by every Word,\" every Word! I was talking on that the other day. [John 10:3-5]\n\nL-219 My own mother, she's gone on now, and she was a very odd woman. And she was, you know, about a half Indian, and she was odd. But in there she was a person that didn't dream. But I don't think... She only had four or five dreams, all of her life. But every time she dreamed a dream, it was true. She had a dream, it was true.\n\nL-220 I remember one time when I first started preaching, many years ago. We was living right up here on the road, right just above here. I was preaching right here at this church. And she dreamed a dream, that I was standing here by the side of three steps. And I was standing, preaching to everybody, that they must walk up these three steps before they hit the highway. And on the highway is a little pearly-like white line, run right into the--the--the doors of Heaven, to the pearly gate. And that pearl had been stretched out to the top of these steps. If that ain't my Message exactly today; justification, sanctification, the baptism of the Holy Ghost! And I was saying that a person has to come by these three steps, to be able to walk that highway. And said that...\n\nL-221 There was a lady came by. Now, you know what kind of shoes people wore thirty-five years ago. There was a lady come by, had on a great big pair like they wear today, spike-heeled shoes. And she come by. And I said, \"Wait a minute, sister. You can't walk that highway with that.\" And I said, \"You--you, you can't do that.\"\n\nL-222 And she said, \"Ah!\" She said, looked around at the rest of the women, said, \"Don't believe him. He's a madman. See? Don't believe him. I'll show you I can be justified, sanctified, and filled with the Holy Ghost, and still walk that.\" And she... I just let her go. Couldn't do no more about it, couldn't stop her. And she jumped up on the highway. And she looked back at the sister, said, \"See, I told you!\" She started to run up, and she...\n\nL-223 You know, as the Bible said, in Isaiah, 5th chapter, that they would have \"outstretched necks.\" They have to; they're pitched over, see. \"Mincing as...\" They have to, have to twist, \"Mincing as they go, making a tinkling with their heels; see, the daughters of Zion in the last day.\" [Isaiah 3:16]\n\nL-224 And she started up that highway, just as hard as she could run. And, after a while, the road got narrower and 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min narrower. She started reeling, mincing like that, and off she went.\n\nL-225 And mother said, \"The horriblest screams that I ever heard in my life, was that woman falling into those flames and smoke, going down, down like that.\" Said, I \"turned around and said, 'See?'\"\n\nL-226 She just obeyed everything but one Word, see, everything but one Word. Sure, Pentecostal women can be saved, sanctified, and filled with the Holy Ghost, and then fail. Absolutely. \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceeds.\" See? See? And she failed It. And as I said, see, she would have went on in, all right, but, see, she failed to listen; telling her what was ahead. And He's wrote the Gospel by the disciples, apostles, and Doctrine of the apostles and prophets, and so forth, and they won't listen. [Matthew 4:4], [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-227 Now notice this quickening Power, Zoe, bringing the Word, the mind that was in Christ was in you then. I'm trying to show you, that, you, when you raised. When God raised Jesus from the dead, He raised up you, also. And also quickened to Life, with Him, you are now quickened to Life, although then you were but an attribute in His thoughts, but God had saw all in Him, at the finish, see. When God looked down upon the body... [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-228 The Spirit left Him, in the Garden of Gethsemane. He had to die, a man. Remember, friends, He didn't have to do that. That was God. God anointed that flesh, which was human flesh. And He didn't... If He'd a went up there, as God, He'd have never died that kind of death; can't kill God. But He didn't have to do it.\n\nL-229 But, remember, He went there with you in Him. See, God had never separated the Bride from the Groom, yet. So when God looked down upon the body of Christ, He saw both male and female. It was all redeemed in that one body. See? They are one, same, same Word. The same Word, spoke of the Groom, speaks of the Bride.\n\nL-230 Well, how can the Bride come, and fail to manifest everything was promised of Him; and the Groom come, and He wouldn't be the Bride? But when He did everything, even to proving it by raising Himself up from the dead, afterwards, then don't the--the Bride have to do the same thing, have to be exactly what the Word said She would be in these last days? Don't She have to return through Malachi 4? Don't She have to be manifested like it was in the days of Sodom? Don't the world have to be just exactly like it is? Isn't these things a perfect identification of the Word of God made known to us? [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-231 Well, friends, I know I'm keeping you a long time, fifteen minutes yet till dinner, but maybe I'll get through by then. But notice, looky here, what a perfect thing it is. I don't know when I'll see you again. See?\n\nL-232 Look, notice this. But God foresaw the Bride in the Groom. Hallelujah! See, to save His Wife, like Adam, He had to go with Her. Adam knowed what he was doing; Eve didn't know what she was doing, but Adam walked out with his wife. See? And Jesus took His Wife's place and became sin for Her. Remember, He became you, He stood your punishment, that you might stand in His place. He stood in your place, that you might stand in His place. What a love! What a fellowship! How can we deny it? How can we do anything but love Him, friend? I could stay on it hours, but let's move on a little farther.\n\nL-233 Like the pentecostal experience today, and the coming of the Holy Ghost in this last days, as promised, is like the abstract to a title deed. See?\n\nL-234 Now, you can get a title. Sure. See? You can get a title to a place, but that still don't say it's yours. No, sir. Somebody way back yonder could come in and put a claim on it. But when you get an abstract, that shows that everything that's ever against it is struck off, plumb back from the foundation. Is that right?\n\nL-235 And when a man has said that he believes the Word, and then when the Holy Spirit comes, It is the abstract to the title. And that gives you permission, when you have that abstract, that every bit of that belongs to you, and everything is on it belongs to you. Amen! And that gives us the abstract, when the Holy Ghost comes upon this title deed that God saw back yonder 'fore the foundation of the world, and put it name on the Book of Life; but was born through a man and woman, and subject to sin, and guilty of sin. But when I believed on It, I received the deed; but when the Holy Ghost come, It was the abstract that everything against me, whether my mother done it, my father done it, my grandmother done it... [Ephesians 1:13-14] 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min\n\nL-236 Like the little, epileptic child I prayed for, a few minutes ago, that come through from the grandparents. The epilepsy fell down, and upon the child, I said.\n\nL-237 But when the abstract has come, It struck off, omitted everything. I'm a abstract holder then. Amen! And as sure as the Spirit that raised Christ from the dead, I have a abstract deed that I'm part of that Body, with the abstract of the Holy Ghost making that body of Word live out just exactly like It did in Him, as He promised in the last day. The abstract! All my sins are struck out, all your sins are struck out, by the Blood of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost is come as an abstract to the title deed that God give me by grace, by foreknowledge. Oh, my!\n\nL-238 What you scared about? No wonder He said, \"Fear not; I am He that was dead and alive again; and I'm alive forevermore; and have the keys of death and hell.\" Don't worry about nothing. Even death ain't going to hurt you. Notice. Beautiful! Let's go right quick now. [Revelation 1:18]\n\nL-239 The abstract title! The debt is settled. Everything against it has been struck off. Ha-ha-ha! Glory! I may act silly, but I feel good. Notice. See? Oh, an abstract deed, do you realize what that means? Do you realize what that means, brother? There is nothing can take it away from you. Amen. I am a holder. Amen. What a...\n\nL-240 What deed? I have now cashed in on my beneficiary, of His death, burial, and resurrection. He become me, that I might become Him. Now, He became a sinner, that I might become a son, amen, and hold the abstract deed. \"For these signs shall follow them that believe,\" see, the abstract deed! Now quickly, before... We got about ten minutes more.\n\nL-241 Let us now notice, quickly, the quickening of the Spirit. I'm going to show you some signs so that you'll understand. Look, now watch what, this \"quickening Power\" was my subject. After the Son has raised up, look how It done on them at Pentecost, what It did to them, what that quickening Power did to them. It quickened them.\n\nL-242 Now let's notice what It did on Stephen. Stephen was full of quickening Power. Wasn't that right? See, he was full of quickening Power. It didn't make him a scared. He said, \"You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Ghost; like your fathers did, so do you. Which one of the prophets that showed forth the coming of the Just One, didn't your fathers stone?\" Oh, my! Done something to him. Sure, he was full of quickening Power. And they said, \"We'll get rid of that guy!\" [Acts 7:51]\n\nL-243 And when he died, they stoned him; and his poor little head, the stones beating against it like that. He looked up and said, \"I see the Heavens opened.\" Quickening Power was working. \"I see the Heavens opened, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.\" That's what quickening Power done for Stephen. [Acts 7:56]\n\nL-244 Notice another fellow, had this quickening Power, his name was Philip. He was so full of quickening Power. He was having a great big meeting down at Samaria. Devils was being cast out. People was baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ. They was having a real meeting. And the Spirit spoke to him, oh, the--the Dynamics come down, and It said, \"Leave this revival.\" But what will the ministers say? Don't make any difference what they say. See? He was full of quickening Power. He had the gasoline, and the--the Dynamics was falling upon him. Said, \"Go out into the desert.\" And he found a eunuch there, and baptized him in the Name of Jesus Christ; one man, who took the Message down to Ethiopia. That right? And he obeyed God. [Acts 8:26-39]\n\nL-245 In obedience to God, if you have never been baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, do it, and watch the quickening Power pick you up then. See?\n\nL-246 When Stephen done this great thing... or, not Stephen. But Philip done this great thing, to leave that great revival and obey the commandments of God, when he fulfilled, by fill... By baptizing this eunuch, in obedience to God, he was so full of the quickening Power till It caught him away. \"It will quicken your mortal body, if this Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead.\" It quickened Philip till he wasn't seen for maybe a hundred fifty miles, over somewhere else, over in another country. It quickened his mortal body. How did he do it? He was so full of the quickening Power. [Acts 8:38-40] 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min\n\nL-247 Oh, Church of the living God, we can't stand around here on little sugar-tits that we are nursing around here today. We've got to be full and prayed up, with quickening Power, until the quickening of the Holy Ghost! We got to be caught away, someday, in that Rapture yonder. Yes, sir. Amen! Oh, my!\n\nL-248 Excuse that expression. I was thinking about a mother that makes those little sacks, we used to, for the baby. Some of you old mammies remember it. The little old baby gets to squalling; you take some coffee grounds and some sugar, wrap it up in a sack and let him suck on it, just to pacify him. There is no strength in that. It'll kill him. See? That old caffeine in there, and stuff, a little sweeten to make him swallow it down, it's getting caffeine in him.\n\nL-249 We are tired of such stuff as that. Get back! You're eagles; back to the Word of God! Be burly; nothing can hurt your feelings, therefore you're free from all the scandal of man. Whatever anybody says against you, that just brings more love. Amen. And, quickening Power, caught away into the Heavenlies, a eagle that's done flew above the chickens, way up yonder in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus! Oh! It was on Philip. That quickened him, caught him away.\n\nL-250 Let's take another man. There was a man by the name of Enoch. Now, he had walked with every Word of God, for about five hundred years. He had a testimony, that, \"I haven't one time failed His Word.\" He got so full of the quickening Power when the Dynamics hit him, on them Mechanics, he didn't even have to die; he just took up Home. Just started walking. He was so... Like Philip, he got so full of quickening Power, instead of going over to the Gaza and going to another place, where, they found him up in the upper coasts there. Instead of that way, he just went, oh, said, \"I'm an old man, anyhow. I just got so much quickening Power, I'll just walk right out of the earth.\" [Genesis 5:24]\n\nL-251 That's the same quickening Power that we have right now. See, It will quicken your mortal body. Isn't that right? It's the quickening Powers.\n\nL-252 Enoch, with that perfect testimony, that, \"Everything God told me to do, I did it. Everything that I seen He said for me do, I done it.\" And he become so full of--of Dynamics, or--or Mechanics, until, when the quickening Power struck him, the Mechanics, It just lifted him right up. He walked on out of the earth, into Heaven. [Genesis 5:24]\n\nL-253 Now, now notice, on Elijah. After... Look, Elijah, that great prophet, man in his day. Excuse me. Brother, sister, in that day he had busted them painted-faced women, them Jezebels and Ahabs. And stood till... And nobody, looked like, stood with him. And he rebuked, and devoured, and stood out there, and God had taken care of him and helped him in every place. You know, the old fellow got tired one day. He said, \"I'm getting old, so I just can't go no further.\" He was going on, I guess, ninety years old; real old, and walking around there, and he was so full of quickening Power. You know what? He looked across Jordan. O God! I can almost see the other side. Can't you? [II Kings 9:30]\n\nL-254 So full of the quickening Power, until, he seen a chariot hooked over there, some horses of Fire and chariot of Fire, hooked to some tree over there. He just walked across the river and went Home, without even dying. The quickening Power sent, caused a chariot to come down from Heaven and take him up. Even picked off his coat and throwed it back for Elijah. That's right. [II Kings 2:11]\n\nL-255 Now, then that fellow picked up that robe, a type of the Church again, see, picked up that robe. Now, he done twice the miracles, which is a type of Christ and the Church. See? Elijah done four; he done eight. See, now, he was--he was double the power, 'cause he asked for it. \"Greater things than this that I do shall you do.\" See? But he was so full of the quickening Power, and everything, till he done all these, double, what Elisha done, more than he did. And notice, he lived a life on up till about eighty or ninety years old, he got old and he--he died. He died, and they--they took him out and buried him. [John 14:12], [II Kings 2:11-13]\n\nL-256 You know, well, that quickening Power didn't leave him. Many, many years after that, when the flesh had all rotted off his bones, he was laying in a tomb. And they were packing a dead man one day, and they saw the enemy, and they just throwed this man in on top of Elisha's bones. There was so much quickening Power on those bones till the man jumped up to life again. Oh! [II Kings 13:21]\n\nL-257 \"It'll quicken your mortal body.\" Though dead and rotten in the grave, and yet that quickening Power rested over 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min that dirt. Hallelujah! Uh! \"He that raised up Christ from the dead also quicken your mortal body.\" The Elijah back there, Elisha and Elijah... [Romans 8:11] Remember, that dead man, that prophet, full of that quickening Power, laying in the grave and rotted away; there was so much quickening Power, till, they throwed a dead man on him, he come to life. He could still lay hands on the sick. Couldn't he? Amen. There you are.\n\nL-258 And remember, we are flesh of His flesh, Jesus Christ. \"We are flesh of His flesh, and bones of His bones.\" Oh, there's no way out of it. We're going to rise, and that's all. You're going to rise, that's all. [Ephesians 5:30]\n\nL-259 Easter means more than just a tradition. It is also now, for our bodies are quickened with Him and we're sitting in Heavenly places.\n\nL-260 And this body may rot in the sea; it may rot in the ground; there may not be a spoonful of ashes; but she is coming forth. For, the Spirit that raised up my Lord from the dead has quickened this mortal body. It's quickened your mortal body. And we are His beneficiaries of His resurrection, His policy of Eternal Life that I talk so much about, you know. No wonder He said, \"Fear not.\" He would know. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-261 For as Paul said, \"Death, where is your sting? Grave, where is your victory? I'm full of quickening Power. Thanks be to God, Who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Yes, sir! Quickening Power. Oh, my! [I Corinthians 15:55-57]\n\nL-262 He is alive forevermore, \"the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" Hebrews 13:8. Notice, Messiah, the anointed One; so is His Bride, the Messiah-ettes, see, the anointed One. [Hebrews 13:8], [Revelation 1:18]\n\nL-263 Notice, death does not stop God's quickening Power. Death can't stop It. When you've got It, It's Eternal. There ain't nothing going to stop It. You can't harness It; you can't--can't do nothing to It. You live your life out, that still don't stop It; just as good as It was. [Revelation 1:18]\n\nL-264 Notice, Moses is full of that quickening Power. Was he? He was a prophet who the Word came to. He was part of the Word. He was the Word of that day. Is that right? And after he was dead, eight hundred years; on Mount Transfiguration, there he stood, with Elijah. That right? The quickening Power, death don't never take It away. No, no. \"I'll raise it up again.\" The Angels come; buried him down there in a valley. He had been rotten and gone, his bones was gone, and everything else, but the quickening Power was still there. It quickened him and brought him up. And there he was, standing there. Notice. [Matthew 17:2]\n\nL-265 You say, \"Is that right, Brother Branham, after eight hundred years?\" Oh, my!\n\nL-266 If you would read in Matthew, I got a Scripture, Matthew 27:51. You can write, put it down. When all those back there, that believed that He would come... The Bible said here, after He come, they were sleeping in the ground. Quickening Power was upon them, and they were a part of Him, them saints. They were a part of Him, because they had believed on Him. [Matthew 27:51]\n\nL-267 Potentially they had that Life, through the sacrifice of a sheep, a propitiation, which could never bring spirit of a sheep back upon the man. How about now with the Spirit of the Man, God Himself, upon you, see, how much more quickening Power do we have! But through the propitiation for sin was offered a lamb, in type. What we have is not the type; it's the antitype. What are we scared about? And those fellows who only had a type, pointing to His resurrection, and went down into the grave with it.\n\nL-268 As Job back there under his great strain, my, everything took away from him! The devil said, \"Let me have him. I'll make him curse You to Your face.\" And then he broke loose. [Job 1:11] Said, \"Don't you take his life.\" And he did (he) all but take his life.\n\nL-269 And his wife even turned against him. Said her breath had become strange to him. In other words, she--she would have nothing to do with him. She didn't seem to love him any more, just pushed him away. \"Job, you're miserable! Why don't you just curse God, and die?\" Said, \"You talk like a foolish woman.\" Oh, my! [Job 2:9-10] 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min\n\nL-270 See, he held right to what he had. Now, he was a prophet. He said, \"I am not a sinner. I have offered the provided sacrifice.\" Amen. He knew where he was standing. He was on the Word. No matter what the others said, he was right there at the Word. Then that great tremendous hour... Said, \"You speak like a foolish woman.\" He said, \"The Lord gave, the Lord take it away; why, blessed be the Name of the Lord!\" Said, \"I come in this world without anything. I come here, naked, I'll go out the same way. Blessed be the Name of the Lord!\" Setting there, broke out in boils, his kids dead, he was poverty-stricken, and his friends all turned against him, his church members, everything else, scraping himself with a... And what a miserable wretch! None of you has ever been through that yet. Still, he held to that Word. [Job 16:2], [Job 1:5]\n\nL-271 He was an eagle. Oh, my! You can't keep the film over his eyes all the time. No, no. All at once, standing on that Word, what happened? The skies peeled back, the thunders begin to roar, the lightning begin to flash, and Job looked up and saw the vision, said, \"I know my Redeemer liveth. At the last days He'll stand upon this earth. And though after the skin worms has destroyed this body, bones and all, that quickening Power will be there. I'll see God for myself, Whom I shall see for myself. My eyes shall behold and not another.\" Is that right? \"Though after my reins be consumed within me, though after the skin worms that's in my body now, will destroy it.\" [Job 19:25]\n\nL-272 You know, skin worms don't come to you. That worm is already in you, your own skin worms. Did you ever notice that? Put you in a coffin, and put it air tight; the bugs will eat you up, just the same, 'cause they're in you. You are just a bunch of bugs, to begin with, on the inside. \"Though the skin worms, my skin worms destroys me, my flesh, yet in my flesh I'll see God.\" [Job 19:26]\n\nL-273 And on that resurrection morning! Glory! Hallelujah! Matthew, this great writer, 27:51, said, \"After He was resurrected from the dead, that the Old Testament saints, many of those that slept in the dust of the earth, come up out of the grave, and entered into the city and appeared to many.\" That quickening Power, still on them bones of Elijah when there wasn't no more bones, still on Job when there wasn't a spoonful of dust left of his body. But the quickening Power was still there. [Matthew 27:51]\n\nL-274 \"If this Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He'll also quicken your mortal body.\" Notice, quickly now. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-275 You say, \"Oh, I wish I lived back...\" You live in a better time. Now if you all...\n\nL-276 I see you putting down some Scriptures. All right, put down First Thessalonians 4:16. Notice how beautiful, see. In the... \"The saints, them that sleep in Christ, will God bring with Him,\" see, saints in the grave, resting. Like Elijah was; some like Elisha was; see, some of them be quickened, some will be taken, some will be in the grave. They will go with Him. \"The Trumpet of God shall sound, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. And we which alive and remaining shall be caught up together with them, to meet the Lord in the air.\" The quickening Power on the living; the quicken Power on the dead. See? [I Thessalonians 4:16]\n\nL-277 That same quickening Power of God presented in both of these prophets. Look at their names, are almost the same, Elisha, Elijah. See the Bride and the Groom? One of them is Mr. Jesus; the other one is Mrs. Jesus. You see, almost the same, just--just between the--the He and She. See?\n\nL-278 Elijah, and look how it's represented here. Now, Elisha... Was taken up in the rapture, represents the Church, all right, Elijah; and Elisha rested until the resurrection. See? It's just like a bird, needs two wings to balance hisself. See? The Church was represented right there in those two prophets. \"For we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord, shall not hinder them which are asleep; for the Trumpet of God shall sound,\" both wings shall come together, and we'll fly away, hallelujah, fly away. Cause, (what?) in the living, or dead, that quickening Power still lives. [I Thessalonians 4:13-18]\n\nL-279 Notice. Remember, remember now, quickened to see what these things are. Watch the quickening Power of this day. Remember, we are quickened. Not long ago, for help...\n\nL-280 And I--I think our Lord said, and so did Paul, \"What the Father showed me, I've held nothing back. I tell you.\" And in these last days when we seen His quickening Power upon us, He even give quickening Power to us, to see the 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min sick healed. We have seen the Quickening Power working among us, like It was then upon them in the early days, see, see It bring back by vision and raise the dead, see It make the sick well.\n\nL-281 The other day I was telling someone. Little Donovan Weerts here, I guess you all know him. I was up hunting with him. Poor little fellow... He's a nice little guy. He comes here to church. He'll... Just a very good friend of mine. And he just... He said, \"Didn't want to bother you.\"\n\nL-282 I looked, and his ear, turned all the way, inside out. And I said, \"How are you, Donovan?\" Just took him by the hand, like that, and a cancer. I said, \"Donovan, what's the matter with your ear?\"\n\nL-283 He said, \"Don't know, Brother Branham. About six, seven months, and just keeps getting...\" I said, \"Why didn't you say something about it?\"\n\nL-284 Said, \"I--I didn't want to bother you, Brother Branham.\" I said, \"Do you know what it is?\" Said, \"I have a idea.\"\n\nL-285 I just put my hand over on him, never said a word. Two days after that, there wasn't even a scar. What is it? The quickening Power, see, It will quicken your mortal body. His ear would eat off, his brains would have been gone, see, he'd a died. But, the quickening Power! See?\n\nL-286 And one day when I was weary, myself, about... I said, \"If you... Boy, you'd better go ahead, you're fifty years old. You, if you going to do anything for the Lord, you better hurry up and do it. You're getting old.\" See? And there that morning, the quickening Power come, and He let me look over the curtain, and I seen all of you over there. Uh-huh. See? He said, \"All that you ever loved, and all loved you, they're give to you.\" See? I seen them all over there like that. What was it? Quickening Power.\n\nL-287 John the revelator was filled full of quickening Power, that stood up and seen the end from the beginning.\n\nL-288 Isaiah was full of the quickening Power, and stood up and seen the Millennium and all.\n\nL-289 Quickening Power! \"And if the Spirit that raised up Christ from the dead, dwell in you, It'll quicken your morty body... mortal body.\" Remember, the quickening Power!\n\nL-290 Look what we've seen in this day. The Quickening Power has come to us, to open the Seven Seals. What was that, the intelligence of a man? No, the quickening Power of God. See, the quickening Power of God foretold this would take place. See, the quickening Power of God made the world testify to It, it's the Truth. The Angel of the Lord, I told you, was around, in a Pillar of Fire; quickening Power let the world testify that It's the Truth. And, in that, they didn't know what It was; and we knew, just look this a way, and It's our Lord up there, you see. [Revelation 5:5]\n\nL-291 He is the One Who opened those Seals. He is those Seals, for the whole Word of God is Christ, and Christ is the Seals that was opened. What is the opening of Seals then? Revealing Christ. [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-292 And the very seven Angels, which represented the Seven Churches all completed, and we couldn't even see It. They did, they took the picture, not us. And there He is, standing there, Supreme Judge; showing that He is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. What identification! Quickening Power did that to us. [Revelation 1:20]\n\nL-293 Quickening Power lets us see His coming. Quickening Power snatched us from death to Life. Quickening Power gives discernment; to know what's wrong with you, and what to do; what you have done, and what you ought not have done; and what you should have done, and what you will be. Quickening Power, all these things!\n\nL-294 Our Lord Jesus is so full of quickening Power, He was all of It, together. He was so full of quickening Power, He said this, \"You destroy this body, and I'll raise it up in three days.\" Talk about confidence in quickening Power! \"Destroy this body, and I'll... this temple, and I'll bring it up in three days.\" [John 2:19]\n\nL-295 Why, why'd He say that? He knew that it was written of Him, see, that it was written of Him, by the Word of God which could not fail. The Word said, \"I will not suffer My Holy One to see corruption, neither will I leave His soul in hell.\" And He knowed that quickening Power would raise Him up, that there wouldn't be one cell corrupt. [Psalms 16:10], [Acts 13:35] 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min\n\nL-296 He said, \"You destroy this temple, and I'll bring it back again in three days.\" [John 2:19]\n\nL-297 Why? It was prophecy, the Word of God. And prophecy, if It's true Word of God, cannot fail. And the same prophecy and Word of God that said He'd raise Him up, says that we are already raised with Him. No wonder He said, \"Fear not.\" And it is written, that, \"The Spirit that is now, was in Him, now in us, also quickens our mortal body.\" Fear not, friend, the S-o-n is up. The Son is up. No...\n\nL-298 Now look at transfiguration. We was, every one, represented there. There was the living saints that had raptured, there was Elijah standing there; and there stood Moses, the dead saints repre-... Also, both of them had quickening Power. Whether one died, and the other didn't die, they're all there. [Matthew 17:2-3], [Mark 9:2-3]\n\nL-299 Notice, oh, look what we are now seeing in these last days. The same thing that He promised, John 14:12. Now look. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Certainly. People say, \"You claim to have power?\" No, no, no. [John 14:12]\n\nL-300 We're just like them at Mount Transfiguration, see. Certainly, we do not claim power. But, we, like--like they was... On the Mount Transfiguration, they wasn't saying, Moses, say, \"See who, see who I am,\" the disciples say, \"see who I am, see who I am.\" You know what happened? Notice, they seen Jesus glorified. That's all they wanted to see represented, Jesus glorified. [Matthew 17:2-5], [Mark 9:2-8]\n\nL-301 And so is it today, we don't try to be some big person. We don't care what's people say about us. Our name ain't nothing; it's His Name. Our life, it's nothing; it's His Life. It's His Power, not our power. And there is only one thing that we love to do, is see Him glorified. And how can it be? When He's glorified in us, by His resurrection that's in us. We see Him represented again as He was, today.\n\nL-302 Did you get that? See, our desire is not to be glorified. Our desire is not some big name. Our desire is not boost some church, or make more in the Sunday school, or try to bring in, hog-tie, push in, offer a picnic party, or bring stars, buttons, or something else like that. That's not our desire. Our desire is to see Him glorified. Glorified, (what?) not with self-pride; but in us, our lives, to prove He is alive and living in us.\n\nL-303 If I can get myself out of the way, so when William Branham not even thought of, and you not even thought of, till we can see Jesus glorified among us. See Him, that's our desire. That's the quick-... gives us the quickening Power. And it gives us joy, to know that we are with Him, both flesh and bone of Him, being the Bride of Him; and seeing His same vindicated methods, proving in us that He is now risen from the dead. See?\n\nL-304 No wonder He said, \"Fear not\", for now, notice, we are redeemed by Him, and now risen with Him. That's what Easter means to the people, \"risen with Him\"! Notice. Now we have His Spirit in us, the abstract deed fully paid.\n\nL-305 No, you don't say, \"Well, I hope I make it.\" You've already made it. Not, \"I will make it.\" I've already made it. I never made it; He made it for me. See? Not me; Him! \"Well, Brother Branham, they say...\" I don't care what they say. There He made it, for me. That's all I want, I'm caring about.\n\nL-306 I just--I just want to see Him manifested. How can you do it, call Him down? No. He is in you. See, He is in you. \"Well, then, Lord, if I can get myself out of the way, You can manifest. Myself... How can You do it? Because You ordained it so. 'All that the Father has given Me will come.'\" Notice. Glory!\n\nL-307 With all that evidence collected, with us now this morning, oh, I think of that song: On that resurrection morning, When death's cords will be broken, We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) we shall rise!\n\nL-308 You believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\" --Ed.] We shall rise! In Him we become part of Him, the Easter, the revealed secret of God like it was then, of Life after death. We are now alive, who were once dead in sin and trespasses. The true Easter Seal has broke death from around me, and I'm alive. The Easter Seal, at the beginning, broke the seal of the Roman seal, the Easter Seal, that He was sealed up. And man, when they died, was gone; but He broke the seal and revealed the secret. And now God, by His Holy Spirit, has broke the seal from around our lives, and 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min Christ is revealed as He lives in us, for now we are quickened with Him. Oh, page after page! We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) We shall rise! (Amen!) On that resurrection morning, When death's bars are broken, We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) we shall rise!\n\nL-309 Oh, aren't you glad! I'm so glad! Way back down yonder, in a little old coal shed one morning, the seals were broken, and I raised with Him, a new creature. His quickening Power; the Son is up.\n\nL-310 Not long ago, I was told a little story about a--a fisherman. A fellow come out and hired an old fisherman to take him fishing out on the West Coast. They went out that morning.\n\nL-311 If any of you have fished out there for the salmon, why, you know what takes place, it gets awful foggy out there. I see my little brother, Eddie Byskal, down there, a missionary to the Indians out there. And we fished, ourselves, out on those coasts.\n\nL-312 So this fisherman was kind of a greenhorn, you know. He went fishing, and they drifted out. Waiting for daylight to come, you know. And they--and they couldn't hear the foghorn no more, and this fisherman got all excited, said, \"Say, we're drifting out to sea! Hey!\" Got all excited.\n\nL-313 He said, \"Sit down, son. Sit down.\" The old fisherman, quiet, you know. He knowed what he was talking about. Said, \"Just wait until the sun comes up, then we can see where we're at.\" You say, \"Must I be Methodist? Baptist? Pentecostal?\"\n\nL-314 Just wait. The Son comes up, we'll see where we're at. He is the Word. Wait till you see the Word manifested, shining across the Seed, the wave Sheaf, we'll see where we're at. Do you love Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-315 Sorry I kept you this long. How many of you is going to stay over for tonight? Oh, just come back again then, this evening, see. About seven o'clock? Did you have somebody else? [Brother Neville says, \"No.\"--Ed.] Let us bow our heads.\n\nL-316 Is there one here, or many, who doesn't have this quickening Power in you? The Son has shined across, and you've set in this tabernacle, you've listened to tapes, and yet the Spirit has never quickened you till you could follow the Word of God, that you women and you man could obey every Word that He's written! Oh, that's a dangerous thing. What if you would be a dead seed, no Life in you? But there is something in you, that tells you, \"I--I want to rise, this morning. I want to rise from the state that I'm in. I don't want to be just a dead seed, be left to dirt and driftwood. I want to rise.\"\n\nL-317 Will you raise your hand, say, \"Pray for me, brother\"? God bless you. God bless you. My, look at the hands; there is no way at all for an altar call. What we call a altar call, people come up around the altar, I'm not too much on it, anyhow. That was just added to the church during the days of the Methodist revival. See?\n\nL-318 The Bible said, \"As many as believed, see, were baptized.\" There is a pool here, full of water, waiting for any candidate who is ready to die to themself.\n\nL-319 Now, you might be buried in, many times, in the Name of the Lord Jesus; but until that seed is Life, see, It won't quicken it. No, no, no. Baptism of waters is like the dew that fell from heaven; it can fall upon the seed, but, there's no Life there, it can't live.\n\nL-320 But if that real baptism of waters, of death to yourself, and you're ready to die out to everything that you ever been taught by creeds and denominations, which is contrary to the Word, and you'll walk as a son or a daughter of God, and you mean it in your heart, watch what that baptism of water will do to you this morning. \"Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your wrongs, your sin, and you shall receive the Sheaf, the wave-offering. You shall receive the Dynamics, the Holy Ghost. For the promise is to you, and all them. To all 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min generations, it'll be.\" [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-321 Father God, I--I have spoke at length, and taken up much of the people's time, but, Lord God, there is no stopping to it. It just seems you just have to quit and walk away, and rest, and come back. We're living in a dying world, amongst dying people; with a Message of Life, and with a evidence of the resurrection. Dear God, we're only going to be mortal once, and what will it be if we let this opportunity pass us?\n\nL-322 Our hearts are burning; our souls are thrilled; these who have come in. And many here are hearing this Message this morning. Yes, two or three hundred lifted their hands. They want to believe, Lord. Oh, surely that seed is not dead, Lord. How could they raise their hand like that? There is something. O God, it's old self, it's that wife of Job standing there, saying, \"Oh!\" But, Lord, let that Job, that believer, walk in, this morning, die completely, and be buried here in this baptism of waters.\n\nL-323 The dewdrops that come from Heaven, the Word of God that says It'll wash away every sin and remit it! You are baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, what for? The remission of your sin, sins remitted in the Name of Jesus Christ.\n\nL-324 May, then, Father, may... If they're sick, may they walk out well. May, if they're crippled, may they walk out under the Power of the Holy Spirit. If they've been sinners, may they walk out washed and clean. And the mechanics, by going in; the Dynamics come from Above, the Holy Spirit, and catch them away, Lord. Quicken their mortal body, then we shall hear genuine new tongues, powers of God, love untold, dying grace and living grace; and a resurrected Christ, a Body, a Bride representing Him on earth.\n\nL-325 Father, they are Yours. They raised their hands. I have preached the Word. Now, Father, receive them, I pray. In Jesus Christ's Name, I ask it. Amen.\n\nL-326 You love Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Isn't He wonderful? [\"Amen.\"] Are you satisfied that you are a part of that Easter resurrection, that you raised with Him? [\"Amen.\"] Raise your hand. You are included.\n\nL-327 \"My little children,\" as Paul would have said. Not trying to impersonate him, but, the love, I love you. I storm the roads and everything else, to get here, to get to speak with you. Come up out of the desert, across the snowdrifts, and so forth, to get here. We fly in planes. You drive across the country, so we can get together. We love one another.\n\nL-328 We are part of one another. Don't you never let Satan tell you anything else. Being a part of one another, we are a part of Him. And we are fellow citizens of the Kingdom, enjoying these blessings, together, of the resurrection.\n\nL-329 And now, see, now you are already resurrected. When God raised Him up, He raised you. The Son is just now on you, and now you're growing into a blossom Life like He was, to be resurrected completely in that last day. Your potentials, you have now. Why do you know? Your soul changed, didn't it? Your body come in obedience to It, didn't it? In obedience to (what, a church?) the Word, which is the Life, then you are now resurrected from the dead. It is Easter, with Jesus and I. It's Easter, with you and Jesus. And it's Easter, with you, I, and Jesus. We are all... Or, Jesus, you, and I, we are all resurrected together.\n\nL-330 And we will rise at the last day, even though our spirits leave our bodies, even though the bodies rust, may they go to dust, may they be burnt up, may they be in the bottom of the sea. The Bible said, \"An Angel poured out his upon the sea, and everything that died come up.\" There is nothing can hide us, or separate us, from that God that we love so well, that's raised us up together.\n\nL-331 God bless you. I've kept you here a long time. If them people is still on that telephone, they sure... At fifty cents a minute, they've really paid, this morning. But, I just couldn't stop at that hour, I just had to go on.\n\nL-332 Now, the Lord willing, I'll be back tonight, to talk with you again. And if I can't, and then you all know... I suppose we're not on no... or no... We're on telephone no more? Not on telephone no more.\n\nL-333 You all know where I'm going, don't you? Africa! I've called for a long time; for years I've tried to get back. Now a vision, the Spirit of the Lord has prepared the way. They said, when those poor natives heard it, that I didn't come the last time when I was there, they laid on the ground day and night, and moaned and cried, and saying, \"Lord, what have we done?\" thousands of them. Those people don't even believe they got a soul. See? And they cried and they moaned, 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min and they cried.\n\nL-334 Don't you send no word ahead. Please don't. See, if that visa would happen to go through there and get amongst them ministers, they would stop me right there. I have to go in as a hunter. I'm going up to the queen that brought seventeen trainloads down and come down to the meeting. I get to go up and hunt on her territory. And I go in, my passport and everything calls for a hunter, not a religious service.\n\nL-335 Then there is going to be one brother meet me, say, \"Why don't you have a little meeting for us?\" The stadiums are already rented. They don't even know it. See? Oh, glory!\n\nL-336 Pray that the will of God will not be hindered. That, my soul that's cried for Africa since I've left, may I be able to return again, then bring you a message of a great meeting. I probably won't see you no more, from today, until I return back. We're going, just in a few days now, the tenth of May. Will you pray for me? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-337 Remember, you don't know what troubles are, till you hit there; witch doctors on every side, and the devil, and don't think they don't know what to do. See? And you better know what you're talking about, when you stand before them. \"But I know in Whom I have believed, and I'm persuaded He is able to keep that which I've committed to Him against that day.\" [II Timothy 1:12] Now, there is some handkerchiefs laying here.\n\nL-338 Dear God, as this Message this morning, of the resurrection, and me standing here, Lord, and proving by the Word that that quickening Power is in the believing child. Therefore, upon believing, in faith, that that quickening Power has changed my life. And these people believes, Lord, and It changed their lives. And we pray one for another.\n\nL-339 I'm laying my hands upon these handkerchiefs, that... May God, Who quickened Jesus Christ and brought Him from the dead, and that Spirit that raised Him up from the dead, be dwelling in our body. [Acts 19:12]\n\nL-340 The Spirit that was upon the body of Elisha, that, after being dead and nothing but bones, it had quickening Power in it. The hands of the apostles had quickening Power in it. The minds of the apostles, the sight of the apostles, the--the tongues of the believers, all had quickening Power.\n\nL-341 Now may that quickening Power, as I lay this Word upon them, and my hands to represent a possessor, by grace, of that quickening Power, may It quicken every one of these sick bodies, and they be made whole again, God, through Jesus Christ's Name.\n\nL-342 May it not only for these handkerchiefs, but for those people out there in the audience, everyone that suffers. Those little children, elderly people, whatever they are, may that quickening Power quicken them right now, in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-343 Now, how many has got quickening Power? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now lay your hands upon one another, if that quickening Power is in you.\n\nL-344 Now, there is only one thing to keep It from, hindering, that's your unbelief. A woman touched His garment, was made whole; a Roman soldier spit in His face, and went to hell. See? So it had... it depends on where you're at. Do you believe It? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Do you believe It? [Matthew 9:20]\n\nL-345 Now I want you to bow your head and pray for one another. Just--just pray right out, just say, \"Lord, this person\"... See, just pray for one another.\n\nL-346 Dear God, we do this in the Name of Jesus Christ, the only Name given among man whereby that we could be saved or healed. These people, who are fellow citizens of the Kingdom, a possessor of quickening Power, quicken It to them, Lord, just now. And may the Spirit go from eagle to eagle, from Word to Word, till the fulness of Jesus Christ be made manifest in each of the bodies, for physical, spiritual, or any need they have need of, as we lay our hands upon one another. In Jesus Christ's Name. Courtesy of 65-0418M, It Is The Rising Of The Sun, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 150 min Living Word Broadcast P. O.

And good morning, friends. Certainly good to be here in Los Angeles again this morning, prior this great convention, and the oncoming meeting of this coming week over at the Embassy Hotel. I'm expecting to see you all over there. And we're all under a great expectations to meet our Lord Jesus, to see Him over there. He promised that He would be. \"Wherever two or three was gathered together,\" He would be there. [Matthew 18:20]\n\nL-2 And I'm sure that I met Him this morning as I come up the steps here in this auditorium, when all the people with great anticipations, waiting for the breakfast and the speaking. And it's good to be gathered here with you, and to the radio audience. There is so many in here, they're... I had to go down on the next floor, and speak to a few. And seen so many requests, heart trouble, and different ailments of their bodies, and we're here now to pray for the sick and the afflicted.\n\nL-3 Just as I got top of the steps... I'm looking at the old gentleman now. He came up to me, and said, \"Brother Branham, years ago...\" He said he had heart trouble so bad that he... they thought he was going to die. And had prayer for him, and the grace of God healed him. And here he is this morning, way in his eighties, just rejoicing. So that makes us take new hope.\n\nL-4 And now I'm certainly soliciting the prayers of the people out in the radio land, as well as here. After I leave this meeting, I'm going to Europe, down into Africa and around, on meetings. And this is going by a vision, so it's going to be a great meeting there, I'm sure. And I felt for years that the Lord has wanted me to come back. The little humbly, humble ministry that He gave me, I don't think He is quite finished with it yet, over there. Seemed like there might be a soul somewhere that I could catch in the Gospel net, the one that He's give me to seine for the people, the way of in Divine healing, praying for the sick. And I certainly solicit your prayers, both you people here and them who are out in the radio audience.\n\nL-5 Now I don't have time just take a text and preach, which I expecting to after a few minutes here in the--in the... this auditorium, but just to speaking to--to you a few moments, get acquainted. And to the people out in the land, I'm going to ask prayer for those out there, right away, and in here also. And I'm certainly glad to meet all these fine new friends that I have never met before, just come in contact with them this morning.\n\nL-6 We've been having great times in the services in other places. I don't get out too much anymore, it's so busy. We just try to keep the road hot between Jeffersonville, Indiana and Tucson, Arizona, where we moved out there a few years ago, by a vision of the Lord, that sent us out there, too, not knowing where I was going. And many of you here, at Clifton's, I spoke to you a little before I left, and at Phoenix meeting, of the vision that had come. I seen seven Angels in a cluster.\n\nL-7 And I know, to the radio audience, perhaps many of you are not full Gospel, and this may seem a little mysterious to you. Which, it would to me, but there is... Anyone who can explain anything, you don't have to accept it anymore by faith. It's things that we cannot explain, that we have to accept by faith. We cannot explain God. No man can explain God. He is sovereign, and He is great and mighty. We just--we just accept it because that we know He is there. And then by our faith, in accepting it, He brings the response back to us, the baptism of the Holy Spirit.\n\nL-8 Which, I'm just going to speak to you about, in a few moments here, on, \"God's way, or place of worship.\" And the only place that you can worship Him, the only place He'll ever meet you, there's got... There is one Church, one place, one time, one people, in all that God meets. And I hope that the Lord blesses the Message to your hearts here.\n\nL-9 Now, coming to Tucson, it was strange, those visions speaking to you in the Name of the Lord. Not one of them as I ever can recall, will ask anyone else if they can recall anytime, that He ever did say anything but what was the Truth. It always happens just the way He says it will happen. 65-0424, One In A Million, Clifton's Cafeteria, Los Angeles, CA, 49 min\n\nL-10 And He is supposed to, according to the Scriptures, return to us in this last days, in this type of ministry. That will be after the baptism of the Spirit, and speaking in tongues, and Divine healing, and so forth, these things. The capping of the pentecostal message is what we're speaking of today. This ministry of the Christ Himself impersonated among His people, with the very same things that He did when He was here on earth; in His Body, the Bride, which is part of Him, doing the same things, as Husband and Wife, or King and Queen, just before the Marriage ceremony. [Malachi 4:2, 5-6], [Luke 17:30], [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-11 This week, the Lord willing, I wish to speak some on that, out in our campaign here, at the--the Embassy Hotel, and kind of get acquainted in my humble way of doing it. The--the time and the hour that we're living, if a person don't know which a way to go, what to do or how to turn, you're--you're not walking by faith anymore; you're just guessing, you're presuming. And presume is to--to \"advance without official authority.\" So if we haven't got the real official authority to know what God said would take place in this hour, how are we ever going to face this hour? And we've got to face it, knowing, by faith in His Word, the things that's supposed to be happening now; and the condition of the nations, the condition of the people, condition of the church, and so forth.\n\nL-12 We've got to know that, and then how to walk out to face it. If you don't know how to do that, you're just--just what we used to call, kind of, haphazardly; just jump in, hoping it will be here, hoping this and hoping that, and \"will it be?\" But God don't want us to do that. He wants us to know what He has said about this day, and then meet it by faith, because He said it would be that way. Then we--we know you're Truth then, because you haven't got some person's word for it; you got His Word of what we must do. And we're hoping that our Heavenly Father will--will grant this to us this week.\n\nL-13 Now, I'm sorry that I cut off, of what I was saying a few moments ago, about coming to Tucson. And I thought, myself, that it was the end of my life. I thought no one could ever stand that shock of that condition that happened in that vision that morning, about ten o'clock at home, that would ever be able to live after that. Why, I come to Tucson, making arrangements with my son, for my wife and--and children to go with him after I was gone, because I thought it was my end. And I, in Phoenix and many of the meetings before it happened, I told you just how it would happen.\n\nL-14 Well, a few months after that, I was up in Sabino Canyon one morning, which is just north of Tucson. I was up there to pray. And while I was praying, I had my hand up in the air, saying, \"Father, I pray Thee that Thou will in somehow help me, give me strength, for the hour that I'm now facing. And if my work is finished here on earth, then I must come to You. And it's not that I regret coming, but I know that You'll take care of my family. And I--I'm just asking for strength for this hour.\" And something struck my hand!\n\nL-15 Now, radio audience, this may seem strange that I've said, but it's the truth. And God is my Judge.\n\nL-16 I looked in my hand, and there was a sword, had a sheath over the handle part. And the handle itself was made of pearl, and just looked like kind of a gold-like guard over the handle part. And the--the knife itself looked rather like it was kind of a shiny like, oh, something like chrome or something glistening in the sun.\n\nL-17 Now, it was about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning, way on top of a mountain. You can imagine how a person (that I feel that I'm in my right mind) would feel standing there with a sword from nowhere, people for miles and miles, holding that in your hand. I felt of it, took and waved the blade back and forth, and, why, it was a sword.\n\nL-18 And I looked around. I said, \"Well, now, how could that ever happen? Here I am standing here, right, here, and no one around for miles and miles, and where did that come from?\" And I said, \"Well, I--I suppose maybe it's the--the Lord telling me it's my end time.\" And a Voice spoke and said, \"This is the Sword of the Lord.\"\n\nL-19 And I thought, \"Well, a sword, then it's for like a king, to knight.\" You know, how it used to do in England and different places. I thought, \"That's what that is for, to knight.\" And I thought, \"Well, maybe I'm supposed to lay hands on people, or...\" I had all kinds... The human mind can be all messed up, you know. You don't know. Our minds is finite; His is infinite. So, and as I was, it... Then it left my hand and I didn't know where it went, just disappeared. Why, if a person didn't understand a little bit about spiritual things, you--you'd go crazy like that. You'd be standing there, 65-0424, One In A Million, Clifton's Cafeteria, Los Angeles, CA, 49 min wondering what happened.\n\nL-20 And He said, \"The vision is not your end time. It's for your ministry. That Sword is the Word. The Seven Seals will be opened, the mysteries of...\"\n\nL-21 And then two weeks after that, or two months, rather, after that, I was up in the mountain with a bunch of friends when it, happened. Seven Angels, just as clear as you're standing here, came sweeping down from Heaven. The rocks in the mountains rolled out and down the hills, and--and people standing there were screaming and going on, you know, and the dust flying everywhere. And when it was, He said, \"Return to your home. Now will be, each Angel will be one of the seals of the Seven Seals.\"\n\nL-22 Which, it's on tape. And the book will be out pretty soon, being now it's kind of grammarized. As you know, my grammar is not very good, and people wouldn't... You just have to be people that love me and know how to understand me on my grammar. But some theologian is grammarizing it for me, and taking out all the--the... Well, maybe I said the wrong word there. I don't even know. So, I heard someone laughing, so I guess that \"grammarize\" wasn't right. But like the Dutchman, you take me for what I mean and not what I say, really.\n\nL-23 And it's just three minutes now, I'm told, unto the closing of the program.\n\nL-24 Now, you dear people out in radio land, and you that's sick and needy here in the audience, would you just lay your hands on each other now while we have this word of prayer for the sick. Now, Jesus said, His last commission to the Church, \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\" \"Them,\" them that believe! \"If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" [Mark 16:17-18]\n\nL-25 Dear Heavenly Father, we are like children today, we're obeying what You said do. We are laying hands upon all these telephone requests. Thou seest them out in the land out there, how they're needy, the suffering. You see those here that are needy, suffering. And we are committing them to Thee, Dear God, with this faith in Thy Word that Thou has said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" Grant it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] [Brother Branham ends the first radio broadcast--Ed.] I I I I I I I [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-26 Thank you, Brother Shakarian. It's certainly a grand privilege to be back again on the broadcast, to speak to some of our friends out in the radio land, as well as present here.\n\nL-27 And we are certainly extending this invitation to you, to come to the Embassy Hotel tomorrow afternoon, to be prayed for. And not only that, but bring the ones that's sinners and those who are backslidden. If we just have prayer for the sick, and we do see God constantly doing great miracles, but that's secondarily. The main thing is to be saved, filled with God's Spirit, which I'm going to speak to you about just in a few moments here, and the sufficiency how that we must be filled with God's Spirit.\n\nL-28 And Divine healing usually draws an attention to people, and brings them in the Presence of God. When God does something that--that they know is un-... well, it's not understood. We cannot mechanically show how it's done. God does it in His Own great way. Then that attracts the attention of the people, to know that there is a Presence of a Power somewhere, that can do something that's beyond human understanding, and that causes them to look to the Lamb of God. And always, Divine healing; I've been told, and I believe, myself, that about between sixty, maybe, and seventy percent, of our Lord's ministry, was on Divine healing. And He did that to attract the people. Then when they were there, He said, \"Except you believe I am He, you'll perish in your sin.\"\n\nL-29 Now, Divine healing is a great drawing card, to get people to look to the Lord Jesus. And Doctor F. F. Bosworth, which many of you was a friend to, and knew him, and his ministry meant so much to me as a young minister. I started out in my meetings, and I run into Brother Bosworth. He used to say, \"Divine healing,\" it's a crude little statement now, he said, \"Divine healing is the bait on a fishhook.\" Said, \"You never show the fish the hook. You show him the bait, and then he gets after the bait and gets on the hook.\" So that's what we try to do. That's our... we... Our aim is to get people to the Lord Jesus Christ. And He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. So if He was the Healer in the days 65-0424, One In A Million, Clifton's Cafeteria, Los Angeles, CA, 49 min gone by, He is the Healer today. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-30 Just a personal testimony before I pray for the sick out in the radio land. It was a few days ago, I was sitting up in a mountains where a great thing had taken place before fifteen or twenty brethren there, where the Angel of the Lord came so down, and great Light flying like a comet, bursting around through the mountains, and rocks flying for two hundred feet, or more, across there, cutting the top of the trees out. And I was standing right under It. And told them just a few months before it happened, It would be there and what would happen; frankly, it was told the day before. And all these men running under trucks and everything, trying to get away. They didn't know what had taken place. And He spoke and said what would take place right immediately afterward.\n\nL-31 Sitting on this certain rock there, right where He had appeared, I had a--a friend that was with us, that had come down from up in Minnesota. His people are here this morning and I'm not sure but what he may be here on some of the other floors. It was Donavon Weerts, and a fine young fellow, a Lutheran that had just give his life to Christ and been filled with the Spirit. Very humble German boy, about thirty years old, family, two or three little children. He moved down in Tucson just to be neighbors with me, where three or four hundred had moved in to be neighbors. So he...\n\nL-32 And I'm glad to have such neighbors as that. They follow me all the way to South Africa, and everywhere around, just to be near and see the... with me, and to be with me and enjoy the pleasures of the Lord. Such a humble fellow, I had never noticed him very much.\n\nL-33 Course, the people that I know and associate with are just like my own brother, sister. I watch them, and feel if I think they're getting out of line, and take them out to one side and talk with them, because I love them. We want to live in Glory together. And sometimes maybe, in the meetings, you think I speak harsh to you. That isn't from it. That isn't because that I don't love you, but it does come from my heart, because I--I... It must be just one way. There is only one way to serve God, and that's... And we must stay in His way, no matter what our thoughts is. His way!\n\nL-34 And I noticed Donavon, on the right tip of his ear, was swollen perhaps three times its size, and looked very red. Well, now thinking maybe that, there in the desert for a few days, that where we had been, that maybe he had got some cactus in his ear. But, taking a hold of his hand, I found out that it was a cancer. So I said to Donavon, I said, \"Donavon, have you... How long has that been on your ear?\" Just to kind of throw him off, like I didn't know. I said, \"How long has that been on there, Donavon?\" He said, \"Brother Branham, about six months,\" he said. I said, \"Why didn't you mention it to me?\"\n\nL-35 He said, \"Oh, seeing you so busy,\" said, \"I didn't want to--to do it.\" Said, \"I just thought maybe sometime the Lord might tell you.\" So I said, \"Do you realize what it is?\" He said, \"I have a good idea.\" I said, \"That is right.\"\n\nL-36 And the second morning. No more than that, holding the boy by the hand; the second morning, there wasn't even a scar on his ear. It was all completely gone.\n\nL-37 So many times we press, trying to get to this, that. Or... See, it's, \"These signs shall follow the believer.\" It didn't say \"if they would pray for the sick.\" \"If they lay hands on the sick, they shall recover!\" We must have faith, ourselves, in what we're doing. All right. [Mark 16:17-18]\n\nL-38 So now Donavon is probably here. You'll meet him. He'll be here, if he isn't here this morning, on some of the other floors. You'll meet him, and he'll know the testimony.\n\nL-39 And what more could I say? I believe Luke, or John, one, said the world couldn't con-... hold, contain the books that could be written of what He's done among the people in this last days; how sick's been healed, alcoholics delivered, by the thousands of them, and all kinds of diseases and afflictions. [John 21:25]\n\nL-40 Now, you out in radio land, as well as here, I'm holding here now a great handful of requests that's come in by the phone this morning, constantly ringing since we've been here. And so we... One hundred and ninety-six requests has 65-0424, One In A Million, Clifton's Cafeteria, Los Angeles, CA, 49 min come in this morning, by the phone, since we've been in here. So let us join in prayer now as each one... Wherever you are, out in the land, lay your hands on one another, if you're believers. If not, lay your hand upon the Bible or something out there, while we pray here and there.\n\nL-41 Dear Heavenly Father, the little testimony of Donavon Weerts, just one of the thousands, Lord, that Thou has so graciously... I pray that You will look down into the hearts of the people both here and in radio land. And may they, every one, be healed. May the evil one leave them, and may they be delivered from all their affliction. Grant it, Father. In the Name of Jesus Christ, Thy Son, we ask it. Amen. \"Thank You, Lord...\" [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] [Brother Branham ends the second radio broadcast--Ed.]\n\nL-42 Well, this is three times for me up here this morning. My! And, you know, it was just told that we've got to vacate the building in about twelve, fourteen minutes, or something. And the management said, who is on the other floor there, and they can't serve any meals. Our meals lengthened out. We have many courses, you know. So we are very, very glad that we have had this great spiritual, gastronomical jubilee, as I would call it, this morning here with this fine bunch of men.\n\nL-43 I'd like to--to make mention that we are... the services again, tomorrow afternoon, over at the Embassy. Now, we will be praying for the sick there, and expecting God to meet with us. And I've come to put in my part, my ministry, into making (all that we can) this meeting to be a success. Not a success because it's our meetings, but a success of people finding Jesus Christ. That's the success. Any meetings, no matter how much we praise God, how many great things that we see Him do, how many times He speaks to us in the Spirit, and so forth; unless there is something accomplished, some souls brought into the Kingdom!\n\nL-44 And Brother Shakarian now just made a--a real statement just now about what he thought about these days that we're--we're living in. I truly believe that with all my heart, that we're living just at the closing time, just in the--just in the evening shadows. The sun is far advanced. And when we see things taking place the way they are today, why, it's hard telling what another generation would bring. A few days ago...\n\nL-45 Just let me give you a little inside something. They made an analysis throughout Arizona, where I live, of all the schools. They gave the children, unknowingly to them, a mental test. And guess what? Including high schools and--and grammar schools, there was eighty percent of the children suffering with mental deficiency. Seventy percent of them was television watchers. See, the evils, they just slipped up on us and we don't... You wonder why it comes. You can hear the Voice of God screaming out against it, and yet here we--we find ourself webbed into it.\n\nL-46 Let me give you a shocking something. See, \"Not all that says unto Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter in; but the one that doeth the will of My Father.\" His will is His Word. We can be ever so religious, have great times, shouting, jumping, in these meetings, which we're... I don't--I don't want to be critical. But I have a--a duty to do to God, and that duty is to be sincere and to say what He wants me to say. And I'm--I'm certainly grateful for the California chapter who has bore with me in--in my convictions. If I don't speak my convictions, I'm a hypocrite and now I'm not even honest with you. And if I can't be honest with you, how will I be honest with God, 'cause I see you and talk to you. Course, we do, to God, too, but we got to be really sincere and honest with one another. We are certainly in a--a horrible, horrible age. And did you ever stop... [Matthew 7:21]\n\nL-47 Just let me give you just a little analysis. \"Not all that sayeth unto Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter therein; but the one that doeth the will of My Father.\" Jesus said, on earth, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word.\" Every Word! Not just now and then, a Word, but by every Word. [Matthew 7:21], [Matthew 4:4], [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-48 It was one Word misbelieved, by God's... of God's commandments, that caused death, sorrow, and every sickness and heartache, to miss God's Word, one Word! If he taken the human race into death, by miss, misbelieving one Word, \"surely,\" surely. But He said it would happen. Satan said, \"Surely it won't.\" But it did.\n\nL-49 So, we've got to keep every Word of God. And if the human and all this suffering and things that went on the human race, by misconstruing, or--or misbelieving one Word, how we going back by missing One, if it's cost all this price, even the life of His Son? 65-0424, One In A Million, Clifton's Cafeteria, Los Angeles, CA, 49 min ... many are called,... few are chosen. ... many are called,... few are chosen. [Matthew 20:16]\n\nL-50 I can't take a text from this, but 'cause we haven't got time, but just to leave something with you. Let us think of...\n\nL-51 I went one day with Brother Shakarian, where they was hybreeding cattle. And I seen the--the... in the laboratory where Brother Shakarian taken me in. And they dipped in the sperm of the male cow, just a little... like a little instrument, a match stem, and took up a bunch of that sperm, and put it under this glass that magnified it hundreds of times. And there was little germs jumping in that, in that sperm. Which, we know the germ comes from the male, and the egg from the female. And I asked the chemist there, I said, \"What's that making that little jump like that?\" He said, \"That's--that's little bulls and calves.\" See? And I said, \"In that little drop?\" He said, \"Yeah.\"\n\nL-52 I said, \"Perhaps then in the entire sperm there would be a million of them?\" He said, \"Oh, yeah.\" See? Now, watch close.\n\nL-53 Now, when this great thing takes place, there is one egg waiting for one germ out of that million. And there is no one can tell which germ that is, or which egg that is. If you'd watch the natural birth, it's more of a mystery than the... than the virgin birth. Because, in this sperm, there is one in there that's predestinated to live, and the rest of them will die. And it isn't the first one meets; it's the first one that comes together with the egg. Maybe the egg may raise up from the back of the sperm, or the middle of the sperm; the germ may do the same, the egg. The germ crawls into the egg, and little tails drop off of it, and there starts the spine. There is only one in that whole load, of a million, that's going to make it, only one; and that's determined by some unknown Force, to man. Yet you're, every one, alike, every one of those germs are just alike. Same thing in animals. Same thing in man. It's determined whether it's going to be boy, girl, red-headed, black-headed, or what. It's determined by God. All of them look the same, naturally, but there is one in there that's ordained to life; one in a million, yet all of them alike.\n\nL-54 When Israel left Egypt, there was approximately two million people left at the same time. Every one of them heard the message of a prophet. Every one of them saw the Pillar of Fire. Every one of them was baptized to Moses, in the Red Sea. Every one of them shouted in the--in the Spirit, beat the tambourines and run up-and-down the bank, with Miriam, when Moses sang in the Spirit. They, every one, drank from the same spiritual Rock. They, every one, eat fresh Manna every night. Every one of them! But there was two made the land, one out of a million.\n\nL-55 What was the test? They all drink in the same Rock, they all eat the same spiritual Manna as we're eating this morning, but the Word test proved them. When it come to the time of Kadesh-barnea, when they started over into the promised land, and they could not go over till they was tested by the Word. And all the--the other ten came back, and said, \"We can't make it! The people are like... We're like grasshoppers, to them, their great walled city. The opposition is too great.\" [Numbers 13:33]\n\nL-56 But Joshua and Caleb stilled the people. They said, \"We're more than able to do it!\" Why? God said, before they left, the promised land, \"I've given you the land. I've give it to you. It's yours.\" But there were one out of each million. [Numbers 13:30], [Numbers 13:2]\n\nL-57 There is approximately five hundred million so-called Christians in the world today, and each day ends a generation. And now, what if the Rapture would come today and five hundred people, universally, would be taken in the Rapture? You would never know or even see in the paper, of them going. And the Coming of the Lord is a secret Coming. He'll come and steal away. It'll be such a minority, till...\n\nL-58 Just like it was in the days when the disciples asked Jesus, \"Why does the Scribes say that--that Elias must first come?\" He said, \"He has already come, and you never knew it.\" [Matthew 17:10, 12]\n\nL-59 Did you ever think what the people did? They went right on believing that Mo-... that Elias was coming. And he was right among them, and they didn't know it. 65-0424, One In A Million, Clifton's Cafeteria, Los Angeles, CA, 49 min\n\nL-60 So will it be in the Coming of the Son of man! They'll do with Him just the same thing. The Spirit of God is here. Well, what are we going to do with It? Are we going to eat Manna, and so forth, and not continually move up as we grow? [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-61 Did you ever notice a seed, as Rev. Pitts was speaking a few moments ago, and how a seed goes into the ground? Many seeds are there in the ground. When God moved upon the water, with the Light, and Light brought forth. The first Presence of God, spoken Light came by God's Word. And God's Word is the only thing that still brings Light. And when the waters went back, the seed was already in the earth, and the Light only brought forth the seeds that remained with germ in them, come forth. God making His creation.\n\nL-62 And now, on Easter morning there was another Light struck the earth, when the Holy Spirit was given. And It's given to bring Light to those Seeds that God, by His foreknowledge, knew that would be here on the earth. As He knew the first natural seed, He knows where the spiritual Seed is. Your body was laying here right then on the earth, when God first brought the earth into existence. We are a part of the earth. We were laying there. And by His foreknowledge He knew exactly who would love Him and who would serve Him, and who would not. His foreknowledge tells that. If it doesn't, then He isn't God. He can't be God without being infinite. And if He's infinite, He knows all things.\n\nL-63 So, you see people making their blunders. They stumble at it. They run at it, and they think this and that, but it doesn't work right, we see it. But there is a working right, that's to find God's perfect will and stand in it, what God called you for.\n\nL-64 As Brother Jack said a few moments ago about down here at the--the Pershing Square, all the confusion. One this a way, and one that way; and about the theologians, and so forth, that you want to know some theology, go down there.\n\nL-65 I guess that's just about like it is in Hyde Park in London. I was down there, everybody has his own idea. It's a--it's a conglomeration of a modern-day world in Babylon.\n\nL-66 But did you notice as--as Brother Pitts went on with his lovely message this morning to us? As he begin to walk out of the park, there he found a little Easter lily. \"In the midst of all the confusion,\" as he brought it to us, \"it had no way to say 'yes' or 'no.' It was a life of God shining in it, in the midst of all the confusion.\" It was there in its radiance, because God had ordained it to be there. In the midst of all the conflict, no one was noticing it. They didn't see the spiritual application of it.\n\nL-67 And so is it today amongst all our great gatherings and groups, and churches and denominations, and so forth. One is pulling this way, \"We must be Baptists, or be Presbyterians, must be this, that, or the other.\" In the midst of all of it, there is a growing flower. There is a power of God right among us, being raised right up in the midst of all of us. Let's just stop and behold it, a few minutes, and watch it this week, and see it unfold right before us. We believe God will do it. Don't you? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-68 I see that we ought to be downstairs by now. So let's pray, each one of us.\n\nL-69 Dear God, when we bow our heads in Thy Presence, we are feel that we are so insufficient to ask. But You promised us that, if we would come, You would not turn us down. And these rude statements that's just been made, by no means to be a doctrine, \"one out of a million,\" but just to kind of remember. For You said: ... strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, that leadeth unto life, and few there will be that will find it. For many are called, but few are chosen. [Matthew 7:13], [Matthew 22:14]\n\nL-70 O Eternal Father, send the Gospel Light across this city, through this coming week of convention. And if there be any Seed, somehow by Your Own great, wise provident, like trying to illustrate it in the sperm of the male and female, may they roll into the convention. May the Holy Spirit give them Light. We realize that the time is perhaps later than we think it is. We pray, God, that as we come here, just believing that maybe there is something here that could be done that would help the people, or--or catch that last sheep. We know, when the sheepfold is full, then the Shepherd will close the door.\n\nL-71 As it was like in the days of Noah, when the last member of the family was brought in, God closed the door. And 65-0424, One In A Million, Clifton's Cafeteria, Los Angeles, CA, 49 min they beat and pounded, but it was too late. Dear God, they had the opportunity. You said, \"I am that Door to the sheephold.\" [John 10:1-2]\n\nL-72 And how striking the song from the poet, \"Are not ninety and nine enough for Thee? But, no, there was one more.\" He might be a little black sheep, or he might be a little nobody, might be the little her or he. We don't know where they are, but that last one must come in and then the door will be closed. O God, Who knows all things, search our lives this morning. And send us wherever that we could go, that we might find that last one, that the door would be closed and the Shepherd inside with the sheep. Grant it, Lord. If there be that one here today, if that one that is supposed to come in... [John 6:37-40, 44]\n\nL-73 \"All the Father has given Me will come to Me. And no man can come, except My Father has drawed him.\" [John 6:44]\n\nL-74 And if there be a tug, or a little feeling, that this might be the hour for somebody here in this audience, here or downstairs, or wherever they may be, may they answer, \"Yes, Lord, I am that little wandering one that's wandered away; and that's fought It off, all my life. I--I--I felt that I should come, but today I'm hanging on the side of defeat. I can't go up or down. I can go no way.\" Oh, may the great Shepherd come, reach down with tender hands and bring that one safely in, place it upon His shoulders and bring it safely back.\n\nL-75 Maybe there is one here, Lord, that's sick, in a similar condition, that the doctor said, \"There is nothing can be done.\" He tried hard to rescue it, but he could not rescue it. It's beyond his reach. There's--there's nothing that he can do. His medicine or his knife cannot get to it. But, O Lord, there is nothing too far for Your great arm, and Your Word is Your arm. So we pray, Dear God, that, this morning, while we are talking to Thee, that Thou will reach down and pick that one up that's sick and cannot help itself, out of the reach of all scientific matters, away from the doctor, may they be healed. Grant it, Lord.\n\nL-76 As we think of David, as he was given a charge over a few sheep, just a few. But one day a bear come in and got that one little sheep and took it out, and would have eaten it up (like a cancer would eat up a body), or a huge lion. But David, not too well equipped with a--a rifle, or, not a swordsman, but with only a slingshot, he went after that sheep. And when he found the--the animal that was about to kill the little sheep, he slew it with the slingshot. Just a simple little weapon with a piece of leather and a string, and, but he had confidence in it. [I Samuel 17:32-37]\n\nL-77 We have no great genius among us, Lord. We are simple people with a simple little prayer, but we are coming this morning after Father's sheep. That woman that has walked the streets, miserably, smoking cigarettes, trying to find peace through the cigarette; that man who has smelled the glass and tried to set it back, but the enemy holds him tight; that boy or girl that's tried to do right, that just can't find strength to break away from the wrong thing; we come in the Name of the Lord Jesus, to claim that sheep this morning. We defy the enemy; because it's a simple thing, a slingshot, a prayer, but we're coming to bring that one back to the Father's fold, that we might give an account of those things that's been committed to our hand. May the power of God now strike faith, down in the hearts of the people, and may that lost soul return this morning. May the temptations of this life turn him away, let him go. And may he find hisself safely upon the Master's shoulders, being carried back to safety again. We ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-78 God bless you all. Till I see you tomorrow, I'll turn the service to Brother Shakarian. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] [Brother Branham ends the third portion--Ed.]\n\nL-79 This, I--I hope that you'll... that I've found more grace in the sight of God and before you, to believe that I would stand here to tell you something that was wrong. I have passed my fifty-sixth birthday, the other day. This isn't just an old man's Message. I've believed this since I was a little boy. And if this isn't true, I've been the most foolish person God had on the earth. I have give my entire life for this Cause. And may I say this with sincerity: if I had ten thousand lives, I would never change my opinion.\n\nL-80 Now, healing is in the reach of every person. Remember, healing is in you. God placed in the peach tree every peach that would ever be in it, when He planted it in the Garden. See, you just... the peach tree or the apple tree, or the fruit tree, just has to grow, from drinking the water in the earth. Now each one of you has those potentials in you, to 65-0424, One In A Million, Clifton's Cafeteria, Los Angeles, CA, 49 min deliver you, for it is God, since you've been planted into Christ by baptism (not water baptism), spiritual baptism. You don't come into Christ by water baptism. By spiritual baptism!\n\nL-81 Tomorrow afternoon, the Lord willing, I'm speaking on that, how and what is the real application of It. We have it in the afternoon so it won't interfere with any of your services.\n\nL-82 Now look, each one of you here is standing as believers, see, then the Life that was in Christ is in you. It can, if you could just see it!\n\nL-83 It's the Devil's business to keep you blocked off from That, keep you blinded. He can just let you be blinded, that's, see, you don't know where you're going then. A man that's blind cannot tell where he is going, he's got to seek the understanding from somebody who can see. Until we can understand, somebody has got to tell us what's Truth.\n\nL-84 And Christ died for you, and you are transplanted from the world into Christ. And everything you have need of is right in you, by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Isn't that right? Now the only thing you have to do is just start drinking from That.\n\nL-85 And as the tree drinks, it begins to push out its leaves, its bud, pushes out its fruit each year. The fruit is not in the ground; the fruit is in the plant. How many understand that, say \"amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] So, see, the fruit is in the plant, and every plant has to drink from his fountain. As the rain comes down, gives that plant, life, to drink from. And, as it drinks, it grows. And it's growing up until it comes to the full bud, just like the Church has, to bloom out in this age.\n\nL-86 And, as we drink, we grow. But if the plant refuses to drink, then the plant cannot grow. And if you will just believe it now, individually!\n\nL-87 Course, you know how the Lord does, show different things, of what you've done and what you should not have done, and so forth, in the meeting. We was hoping that the Holy Spirit would fall upon us this morning and do such, as we stood. But I kept waiting.\n\nL-88 I think it's the nervous part, thinking that downstairs they want us out of here, see. But they're wanting us; we're late now.\n\nL-89 But believe this, with all your heart. Please do. If I--if I have found grace in your sight, as a truthful person, believe this. Now put your hands on--on each other.\n\nL-90 Now look, now, the Bible didn't say, \"These signs will follow William Branham.\" Didn't say, \"It'll follow Oral Roberts only.\" Didn't say, \"It would follow Brother Kopp,\" or somebody.\n\nL-91 \"These signs shall follow them,\" plural, \"that believe. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" It's that Power of God that's in you, that brings the Life to the person you got your hand on, the Life-giving source of the Holy Ghost. [Mark 16:17-18]\n\nL-92 Dear God, in the Name of Jesus Christ, in this crucial moment when the church... may they stand at this second, without nervousness, and may the Power that raised up Christ from the grave, quicken to them just now the Truth of the Gospel, that Jesus' commission was, if they \"lay hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" May every demon power, every sickness, every disease, every affliction, every tormenting thing that's happened to the people, may it leave just now by faith. As believing people, we ask it in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-93 Now raise your hands and give Him praise, if you believe that He does it.\n\nL-94 Dear God, this baby will die, Lord, unless this is done. I condemn this knot, in the Name of Jesus Christ. May it leave the innocent child. Amen. Now, the doctors have tried, and they fail. Just believe.

Dear Heavenly Father, we certainly deem this a privilege to be here today in this city of Los Angeles, and amongst these, the believers that... the Elected that's been called out of the world, separated children of God, in this great hour that we're living, under this great expectation of the appearing of our Lover, the Lord Jesus, at any time. We thank Thee for this in our heart, that we believe that He will come in our generation. We're looking for Him today. If He isn't here today, and we're here tomorrow, we'll be looking for Him tomorrow.\n\nL-2 Dear God, we pray that this meeting will be just a--a special meeting. May it be a time that it'll make a--a record for the Church advancement, that'll be on Your Books in the Eternity. Bless every feeble effort that we put forth, Father. We realize that we're a total failure without You, so therefore we must have You, Lord, if it can we continue. And we do not want this for our own glory. We want this for Your glory. For that's our heart's desire, is to see Jesus glorified in His people. To strengthen the faith of those, Lord, in this day when the battle is so hard, we've come in for this revival among us, and a retreat, a refreshment. We pray that You will grant all these things to us, for we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. (You be seated.) [I Peter 4:11]\n\nL-3 Brother Shakarian, Sister Wyatt, and to the friends of our Lord Jesus Christ, I certainly appreciative of this opportunity to be in Los Angeles again, to preach of this glorious Jesus that we're all out here to learn more about today. If our efforts...\n\nL-4 [Someone speaks to Brother Branham concerning the microphone--Ed.] Yes, sir. [Blank.spot.on.tape]... this kind. This is quite a complicated affair. Say, this thing doesn't like to cooperate. [Others suggest how to adjust microphone.] Well, it isn't going to work like that. [Blank.spot.on.tape]... Brother Shakarian. Now that sounds a little better.\n\nL-5 I'm kind of small, got a small voice, and but a great big Message from the Lord. A lot of opposition from Satan, to keep from bringing It, but we'll get here anyhow. We're trusting this will be a great week for all of us.\n\nL-6 I was sitting there thinking of how many times that our dear deceased Brother Thomas Wyatt, no doubt, had spoke from this same pulpit, a great servant to Christ.\n\nL-7 I knew Brother Wyatt. He was always a great inspiration to me when I would meet him and talk with him. I remember, just as a boy preacher, he would always... his book, called, Wings Of Healing. I like that title, Wings Of Healing.\n\nL-8 And we're glad to be here in this temple that's been dedicated for service of Christ. God bless his widow, and all of you people who... Sure, I know you miss him, too. I missed his program. When I heard that he was gone, I--I could hear that voice. He was getting a little aged, but he still carried a good strong voice, and--and had a message from God. And his life still lives on here in you people. And over in the mission fields where he sent all those units, and so forth, the Gospel still moves on because of Thomas Wyatt. May his soul rest in peace until the time we meet him in that glorious Land where there is no death or old age. We're here to carry on now until our time is called or the great general resurrection when Jesus comes to get us all.\n\nL-9 Now I know you have service here, I think, tonight. And I was told, a few moments ago, that--that you had service here tonight, so I will hurry up as quick as possible.\n\nL-10 Because, I've got Monday night, Tuesday night, Wednesday night, so forth, this week, so I'm trusting that the Lord will bless us. We're going to pray for the sick. We're going to preach Christ, if He will, if it be His will, in all the power of His resurrection that He will permit us to do. And whatever He gives to do, that we want to do with all our heart. And I--I know that He'll bless us if we'll just believe Him.\n\nL-11 And now just before we open the Word, to read It, I want to speak to Him again, while we bow our heads and get quiet now, and trusting the confusion is over. We realize, all Christians know, that the enemy, our enemy, works on 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min every hand. But, see, when things like that happen, just hold quiet. God knows what it's all about. See, just sit still, He might have been doing something you might not know nothing about right now. Let's speak to Him.\n\nL-12 Father, we pray now that You'll calm the sea, the mighty Lord Jesus come walking in on His Word now, introducing to us, in a new spheres, and His power and manifestations. We ask this, as we read His Word, may It be quickened to our hearts today, that we might know Him, in the power of His resurrection. For we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. , [Philippians 3:9-10]\n\nL-13 Now if you'll turn in the Book of Deuteronomy. I want to read a verse, or two, out of the Book of Deuteronomy, the 16th chapter of Deuteronomy. Observe the month of Abib, which means April, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee... out of Egypt by night. Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover of the LORD thy God, of the flocks and of the herd, in the place where the LORD shall place... (pardon me)... in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name therein. Thou shall not eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall thou eat unleavened bread therein, and the bread of affliction; for thou comest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste:... thou mayest remember the day that thou comest... out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. And there shall be no leavened bread seen in thee, all the coast, all thy coast seven days; neither shall there be any... flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at the evening, remain at all until morning. Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any gate... which the LORD thy God giveth thee: But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shall sacrifice the passover at evening, and the going down of the sun, at the season that thou comest forth out of Egypt. [Deuteronomy 16:1-6]\n\nL-14 [A baby now cries out, in the congregation--Ed.] Like we got some trouble again. I believe I can holler louder than that kind of a thing, see. See?\n\nL-15 It's a very strange text I wish to speak a little while on, this afternoon, is on: God's Provided Place Of Worship.\n\nL-16 Now, this is unusual. But as I've said, many times before, that God usually dwells in unusual manners, unusual places, does unusual things, because He is unusual. Ever who believes on Him, acts unusual. There is many, many things that we would like to say about His unusualness. But I know that all, who are acquainted with Him, knows that He is unusual, does the unusual things, some sometimes at the unusual time. So we are trusting today that God will bless these, this reading of the Word, and the text that I have chosen to talk to you about.\n\nL-17 Now, what I think that caused our trouble here, was, they cut them tape recorders in over there, and just pulled the current right out of the microphone. So, if they don't fix it, why, you'll hear me anyhow. God will fix our ears so that we can hear.\n\nL-18 The reason I want to speak on this text, and it's a good time to do it, at the Full Gospel Business Men's meeting, is because all of the churches, or many of them, are represented in this group, all different denomination.\n\nL-19 And I find, many times, that people, meeting them on the street, in the highways, and on planes, trains, buses, I'll say to them, \"Are you a Christian?\"\n\nL-20 One of them will say, \"Well, I'm Methodist. I'm Baptist. I'm Presbyterian. I'm Lutheran. Pentecostal,\" or something on that manner. And all... [Microphone system squeals--Ed.]\n\nL-21 Everyone has got a denomination that he wishes to represent. And that's perfectly all right to be represented by a denomination, but, still, the bad part of it, that each one thinks that this certain group is the only group that--that's going to go to Heaven, and it's the only one that--that God is represented in, at all, is somebody's certain group. I thought this afternoon would be a good time to settle that. [Congregation applauds--Ed.] And perhaps that's why Satan keeps working on this microphone. You know, anything that man makes will go wrong, but what God makes doesn't go wrong. So being a good time to do it, a good place to do it, so, God help us that, by His grace, we will try to do our best 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min to talk about it.\n\nL-22 Now this text, coming out of the Book of Deuteronomy. I understand that Deuteronomy... as I have some Scriptures and things written down here.\n\nL-23 It used to be I could think of them real fast, but since I passed twenty-five, the second time, it comes a little hard for me to remember it all. So, I go into the room and pray. And as He gives me the Scriptures, I jot them down, and maybe a note now and then, with it, kind of keep my mind running the way it was when He gave it to me.\n\nL-24 Deuteronomy being a Greek word meaning \"two laws,\" the word Deuteronomy. And God has two laws.\n\nL-25 And one of them is the law of death, to disobedient to His Word. We find that, when Eve disobeyed His Word, it brought death. That's one of His laws, \"The day you eat thereof, that day you die.\" , [Genesis 2:17]\n\nL-26 And then He has another law, which is the law of Life, to obedience, if you don't do such a things. Why, keeping His Word, you'll live. [Romans 8:2]\n\nL-27 It boils down to two things, to my way of thinking, that's, either keeping His Word or disobeying His Word. , [I John 2:5]\n\nL-28 One of these laws was given at Mount Sinai. And the other was... That's the law of death. The other law was give at Mount Calvary, where the law of Life was given, through Christ Jesus. He also has two covenants. [Exodus 31:18], [Exodus 34:29-32], [John 3:16]\n\nL-29 He had a covenant with Adam, the first man on earth. And that covenant was on conditions, \"If you do so-and-so, I'll do so-and-so.\" Adam would had something to do in order to keep this covenant alive before God. He had to walk in God's ways, keeping all of His Word, not breaking one Word. [Genesis 2:16-17]\n\nL-30 But then He made another covenant, and that was with Abraham. This covenant was not on conditions, but was unconditionally. God gave the covenant to Abraham, no strings tied to it, at all. Unconditional! Not, \"I will.\" \"I have! I've already done it.\" [Genesis 17:2-8]\n\nL-31 And that's the law that Christians must live by. Is not what we do ourself, but what He has done for us. Christ has already been sacrificed. Not, \"He will be.\" He has been! It's a finished product. He lived, died, rose again, ascended into Heaven, has come back in the form of the Holy Ghost. So, it's a finished work, with God. Christ, knowing no sin, became my sin; that I might stand in His place, He took my place. I was in Him, at Calvary, when He died. There I must die with Him, to live. Because the law of sin and death is in the body, you have to die, to be reconciled to Him. , [Romans 8:2-3], [II Corinthians 5:21]\n\nL-32 But now we get all these words that we could use, these great texts, which we're all familiar with many of them, and the great types of the Scripture. But, this afternoon, we're confronted with this, that, in the face of all this, He still says there is only one place that He'll meet you, in the face of all of our different theories. We've had Judaism. We've had Mohammedanism. We've had... We got all kinds of creeds and denomination, churches, and so forth, but yet God said there is just one place that He'll meet you. All those places, each one says that, \"He meets in my church. And if you don't belong to my church, He--He won't meet you. You, you just got to be in this group or He--or He just won't meet you there. Or, He won't meet you nowhere else but there, rather.\"\n\nL-33 And then we find out here that He does have one place, just one place only. \"Thou shall sacrifice the sacrifice in the place that the Lord thy God shall choose.\" Now He's got a chosen place that He meets the worshiping children, and they were not to sacrifice anywhere else but in that one place. Any other place would not work. He had one certain place that He would meet them. And one place, alone, is where He meets the worshiper. [Deuteronomy 16:2, 6]\n\nL-34 And then, if that be true, we better be very careful that we find that place. I think it's very behooving to us, that, as people who know that we are dying, and living in a dying race, living in a dying age, living in a dying nation, under the banner of death.\n\nL-35 And this world must soon come to an end. It can't go much longer. Sin is too deep. It's beyond hope. There is no more hope for the world. It's past that. 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min\n\nL-36 I believe the Holy Spirit is gleaning in the fields, finding this one and that one, for the hour is far spent. The Gospel has been preached to every nation. Ism's and things has followed It, but yet the Gospel has went on just the same.\n\nL-37 And now, at the end time, we see the things happening the way they are, there's a great warning amongst the elected people of God, to find what is right. And it behooves us to know that. Now, not somebody's theory, but to know what is Truth, what the Bible says is the Truth. Because, it'll be too late one of these days, for us, and this may be the day, so let's take real consideration of what God has said.\n\nL-38 Remember, when God speaks a Word, He can never take it back. He has to ever remain the same. He can never say something, and then say, \"Well, I--I didn't exactly mean that.\" See, He is infinite. He knows the best, to begin with. We say things that we think is best, then after a while we take it back. But God can't do that, and remain God. So if He is infinite, He--He does not do that, because He is perfect in every Word. He never utters a Word unless it's Eternal. All of His Eternal's was with Him at the beginning, His thoughts, His attributes, and they're only expressing themselves in the world today. [Ecclesiastes 3:14]\n\nL-39 Now, remember, He has a provided place, one place alone where He'll meet the believing children. Anywhere else won't work.\n\nL-40 Remember, Jesus said, when He was here on earth, talking to a bunch of people who was very religious, very fine, very cultured, a very zealous people, of God, but Jesus said to them, \"In vain you worship Me,\" teaching for Doctrine their traditions of man. Remember how pious those people was, and how zealous of God. I believe if we were counting the people who were more zealous, of today or that day, they would be more zealous than we are. Far more! When it come to keeping the traditions and laws, and things, they lived by those. And they were very zealous of God, and they believed God. But Jesus, God made flesh among us, said, \"In vain do you worship Me.\" Now, He didn't say they didn't worship Him. They was worshiping Him, but in vain. [Matthew 15:9], [Mark 7:7-9]\n\nL-41 So anything in vain is of non-, no avail, doesn't do no good. You should never do it, because you're just wasting your time. You're wasting your breath, you're wasting your efforts, until we come to know what we're doing.\n\nL-42 Surely, if God expects people to be perfect, as Jesus said, \"Be ye therefore perfect even as your Father in Heaven is perfect,\" there must be some preparation somewhere. And He said, \"I'll choose the place that the people will worship Me. No other place will I meet them.\" And, now, that's got to be that place, and we ought to seek it out. Find out where it's at, and then go there. And I think we should turn there, quickly, when we find the place, leaving other things alone. [Matthew 5:48]\n\nL-43 Now, remember, Jesus said in this same Scripture here that I'm quoting. Man's tradition then is in vain. We should never fool with it. There needs be, somewhere, some place that He has provided a place for us, that we could come and the worship would be received. Now, remember, outside of that chosen place, no matter how sincere you are, how fundamental you are, you are still worshiping in vain. [Deuteronomy 16:2]\n\nL-44 I know that sounds rude. But, the building is about finished, we don't want it shaking. Let's bolt it down with the Gospel, so that when people meets you on the street, or wherever you are, you Christians, that you'll have an answer for them.\n\nL-45 In the hour when they're saying, \"Oh, this is That. And I seen these do this, and that do that.\" Certainly, all these things has got to happen. But there is a place that's provided by God alone, and that's the place that God meets the worshiper, alone. [Deuteronomy 16:2, 6]\n\nL-46 Notice the 2nd verse, \"Worship in the place that I have chosen.\" Chosen what? In this place shows' that He has a place where all people worship. Other places are in vain. \"And in this same place,\" He said, \"I have chosen also to put My Name in this place. I'll choose a place, and I'll put My Name in it, in this place that he's going to worship.\" [Deuteronomy 16:2]\n\nL-47 Now, this shows that there is one place, just one. It must be God's choosing; it can't be ours. We have no choice coming; He's already chose it. Now, what God chooses is right. I can choose wrong, you can choose wrong, but God 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min cannot. Choose right. After all, it's, He's the one that's being worshiped. And He's got the place where He wants His worshipers to meet there, and we must meet Him there. That's the only place that He stays; only place that He'll hear you from. [Deuteronomy 16:2, 6]\n\nL-48 Let us notice here, also, \"The place I've chosen to worship Me in, I'll put My Name in that place.\" [Deuteronomy 16:2]\n\nL-49 Oh, now let us search the Scriptures for that place that He has His Name in. Now we have shadows and types, all through the Bible, we know that, of different places where He met the people, but that's not the place that He'll meet them today. Because they were only foreshadowing something, coming up to the real place where He's to meet the people, the place, the Church that He is to meet in. And there is a place, there is a Church, that God promised to meet the people in this place and answer their prayers, if they would just come to this place and worship Him.\n\nL-50 Now we find out that there is many claim that--that they have the place, God's Name is in their place. But, you see, they put God's Name in there. There is a lot of difference between God putting His Name there, and somebody putting there, His Name there. See? We must remember that God said, He would put. \"I have put My Name. I will put My Name in this place. And that's the place that I choose, and have chosen, that people should worship.\" [Deuteronomy 16:2]\n\nL-51 This, bringing us now in view of these shadows of time, brings us Christ in view. All the Old Testament foreshadowed Jesus. In Egypt, that night when there was to be a--a passover lamb killed for the protection of the people, we realize that God had one place, one condition. No matter how young, how old a priest, a clergyman, whatever you was, you must be in this certain place. All outside that place, perished. You must be in this one place, a place that He provided.\n\nL-52 Now, we could spend much time, this afternoon, in explaining that, which would be just reviewing what we already know, that how Christ foreshadowed in the types. The sacrificial Lamb, how it must be kept up, a male without blemish, and how it must be killed by the elders, and how that the blood must be sprinkled on the door, all foreshadowing the coming of Christ. And under this shed blood was the place that God met the worshiper, when the Death angel passed through the land. [Exodus 12:5-7, 12-13]\n\nL-53 I believe that we're ready to go out of Egypt, one of these days, and go into this promised Land. And it's time that we got in the right place, and quit this here fussing around, \"I'm Presbyterian. I'm Methodist. I'm Baptist. I'm this. I'm that or the other.\" Get out of it, and find where this place is, because there is death everywhere besides His chosen place. Death will strike just as sure as the world, if we're not in His chosen place. But where He chooses, death cannot come.\n\nL-54 If you notice in the sacrificial lamb, death had already visit there. Death had come to this place because the lamb had died. Death had already visit. And so where death had visit, then God promised that would be His place. Then, Him in view, we see now what the sacrificial lamb was, what the place of life was at that time.\n\nL-55 Now, to me, this denounces all arguments. With Christ being in view, being the sacrificial Lamb, then that denounces all denominations, all creeds, all dogmas, all church-anity. It denounces the whole thing. That's right, for we find, here, Him in view, for He is the pure unadulterated Word of God. Saint John 1, said, \"In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\" Therefore He is God's unadulterated Word made flesh, made manifest. [John 1:1, 14]\n\nL-56 And this in view, we could not attach that to any church in the world today, any denomination. Any place like that, we could not attach it, because it isn't so. We put Christ's Name upon a building, call it the churches of \"Christ,\" and this, that, or the other. That doesn't make it so. That doesn't do it, at all. But when God puts His Name in something, that's what does it. [Deuteronomy 16:2]\n\nL-57 Now, there is nothing in the Bible that would type our modern organizations, except Babylon. That's the only type in the Bible of our modern organization, organized religion, because it was founded by Nimrod and a forced unity amongst religious people. And that's what the creeds and our denominations do today, force unity, \"You either belong to this or you're out!\" And we're coming now, as we can see, to a forcing all into one great unity of it. But that is a 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min mechanical made advice by a man, and it cannot stand. It is not God's will. It is not God's program, no matter how people try to say it is. It is not. It can't be. It's just impossible, for it to be. God wouldn't put His Name in such a thing as that that denys His Word. How can God live in something that denys His Own Word? You cannot do that. [Genesis 10:8-10]\n\nL-58 So we find out, it doesn't attach to any church, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Catholic, Greek Orthodox, whatever it may be. It's not God's place of worship, yet.\n\nL-59 Now let God, Who made this promise, come forth and prove it, that it's right. That's the way to do it. If He is still God, He is still God! If He ever was God, He remains God!\n\nL-60 And now we see this forced religion, right in view now, to bring all the little groups into \"one great unity,\" they call it. Some of them believe in this, and some believe in that; and some deny this, and some deny that. The Bible said, \"How can two walk together except they be agreed?\" It'll never work. [Amos 3:3]\n\nL-61 We've got to be in an agreement. And what in agreement with what? Not in agreement with one another, as much as we've got to be in agreement with the Word, with God. That's what it's got to be in the agreement with.\n\nL-62 Now we find out, and a forced unity was represented by groups of people at Babylon. God cannot put His Name in such a thing as that. He never did and He never will. Though they tried it, they put their name into it, put His Name into it, but it's not so.\n\nL-63 But we must find where He put His Name, for it is the place and the only place that He has provided for the Christians to come, and believing children, and worship Him in this place. What would this place be?\n\nL-64 Now to back it up, we could take the entire Bible to back up what I'm going to say. For, the place that He chose is in Christ, in Jesus Christ. It is in Him, His Son; God's Son, Jesus Christ.\n\nL-65 \"Well,\" you said, \"I thought the Scripture reads here that He said He would choose the place, and He would also put His 'Name' in that place.\" [Deuteronomy 16:2]\n\nL-66 Well, the son always takes the father's name. My name is Branham because my father was Branham.\n\nL-67 And Jesus said that He came in His Father's Name. Saint John 5:43, \"I come in My Father's Name and you receive Me not,\" therefore there is where God placed His Name, under the sacrifice of His Own Son! That's God's only provided place. There is where people can meet God, is in Christ. That is His provided place. No denomination, no creed, no nothing else, God has promised to meet. Only in Jesus will He meet, for that's the only place His Name is. [John 5:43], [John 10:25]\n\nL-68 We also hear Jesus, as I follow the Scripture out, in John, John the 5th chapter and 43rd verse, He said, \"Another will come, and come in his name, and him you will receive.\" We can join a creed, \"another,\" we can join a denomination, you'll receive him; but when you receive Jesus, it's different. \"Another will come, 'I'll say I'm Methodist, I'm Baptist, I'm Presbyterian,' you'll receive that all right. But I come in My Father's Name, doing that what the Father said I would do, and you receive Me not.\" He said, \"John came, and he had a great witness, but I have a greater witness in God--in God than what John did. For what the Father has given Me to do, that I do,\" the Words that was written of Him, what He must be in that day. For He was... [John 5:33, 36, 43], [John 17:4], [John 10:25]\n\nL-69 His Name was God. God has many titles. God is a title, Itself, was called Jehovah-jireh, Jehovah-rapha, Jehovah-manasseh. He was called the Rose of Sharon, Lily of the Valley, Morning Star; Alpha, Omega, Beginning and End; then Father, Son, Holy Ghost; all these titles. , [Song of Solomon 2:1], [Revelation 22:13, 16], [Matthew 28:19]\n\nL-70 But His Name, God's Name is \"Jesus Christ,\" the Anointed One. That is His Name. He had many titles, but one Name, the only, \"Not another Name under Heaven given among man, whereby you must be saved.\" We find that that's true.\n\nL-71 Also this warning, that, \"When this other one comes, that he come in his own name, 'Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal,' so forth, you'll receive him. You'll join up with him.\" But Christ is turned down. They turn That down. [John 5:43] 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min\n\nL-72 The prophet said! Let's trace his name a little bit. The prophet said, \"His Name would be called 'Emmanuel.'\" Now, Isaiah said that, about the 7th chapter. And also in Matthew 1:23, said, \"This was all done, that it fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, 'His Name shall be called Emmanuel, which is by interpretation, \"God with us.\"'\" [Matthew 1:23], [Isaiah 7:14]\n\nL-73 Emmanuel, and His Name was Jesus, God with us, with His Father's Name. He came in His Father's Name. There is where God placed His Name, in His Son. That's the only place that you can worship Him. The only place God will ever meet you, is in that Son which was typed by the sacrificial lamb. And all down through the Old Testament, all brought types of that one thing, that that place alone, God, alone, met under the sacrificial blood. Only place He met, the only place is He meets today; it's not in the name of creed, or in a name of a denomination, name of a church, or name of a group, or name of a society, but in the Name of \"Jesus Christ!\" [Isaiah 7:14], [John 5:43]\n\nL-74 I tested that when I was a young man. I had often heard of spiritualism, of the Devil, how he does things. And I knew if there was a God, there must be a Devil, because the Bible said there was a Devil. And he, I thought... heard about these spiritualists. I went to some of them, found out they were phonies, nothing to it, just a big bunch of make-belief. But I found out there were some of them were real spiritualists. [Revelation 12:9]\n\nL-75 And I was at a camp one time, where a minister and I went to see them in there. They had raised the table up from the floor, and had whisky glasses sitting over it; and taken that table, turned it back and forth. And a guitar flying through the building; people's clothes. Had had this up, in the room. Said, this medium said, \"I challenge anybody to knock it down.\"\n\nL-76 Two man said, \"I'll get it down.\" They grabbed it around the legs like that, and tried to hold it. It wouldn't. Why, that table throwed them plumb across the floor.\n\nL-77 Don't you just sit around. If you've never been a missionary and been on fields, only thing you know is just the thought of a Devil. If you look out here on some of these people walking around the streets, you can see him. But there is a Devil! Certainly is.\n\nL-78 And people worship the Devil, don't even know what they're doing. They worship the Devil in churches, \"Teaching for Doctrine the commandments of man, creeds--creeds and traditions.\" I said... [Matthew 15:9], [Mark 7:7]\n\nL-79 This woman hollered over to me, and said, \"They tell me you're a preacher.\" I said, \"I am.\" She said, \"Then if you don't...\" Said, \"What do you think about this?\" I said, \"It's the Devil.\" And she said, \"Well, then, if you've got so much power, knock it down.\" I said, \"I don't have any power, at all. I have no power, but I'm here representing One.\"\n\nL-80 I said, \"Lord Jesus, You said, in Saint Mark the 16th chapter, 'In My Name they shall cast out devils.'\" I said, \"Now, that Your servant may know, as the battle lays before me!\" [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-81 I said, \"I command that table to fall down, in the name of the 'holy Church,'\" and it stayed right there. I said, \"I command that table to fall down there, in the name of the 'Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,'\" it stayed right there. I said, \"I command that table to fall down, in the Name of 'Jesus Christ,'\" and like to a-broke all four legs off, hitting the floor!\n\nL-82 \"In My Name they shall cast out devils!\" That's the Name of the Father. He put His Name in Jesus Christ. And in Him He meets, to worship. In Him He meets, to cast out devils. In Him He meets, to heal the sick. In Him He meets, to save. In Him He meets, to save, fill with the Holy Ghost. That's God's only place to meet people for worship. Now we find out that Jesus said also that... The word, Name Jesus, means \"Jehovah-Saviour,\" Jehovah the Saviour. [Mark 16:17-18]\n\nL-83 Remember, \"You shall not worship the Lord...\" Why? Verse 5, \"You shall not worship the Lord in any gates, that the Lord God giveth thee. Any gates, you shall not worship Him there,\" God said, in 5th verse here, of Deuteronomy 16. \"Thou shall not worship Him in any gates, that the Lord God giveth thee. He give you these things for temptations.\" 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min We're going to get into that, this week, the Lord willing, see whether God takes His Word back, or not. Notice, He give you them gates, but don't worship the Lord in any of those gates, because the Lord thy God ain't going to meet you there. [Deuteronomy 16:5]\n\nL-84 But the Lord God has chosen the gate. He has chosen the door. Jesus said, in Saint John the 10th chapter, \"I am the door to the sheepfold. I am that door.\" He is Jehovah-Saviour. [John 10:7]\n\nL-85 Now we could go on here for hours, explaining that. But I'm sure you understand it, by your action, that you--you respond to the Truth and to the Word. So we'll not go any further, you can take it anywhere you wish to. Everywhere you come, if it's the Truth, it'll fall right back in line with the rest of the Word. You can't make the Bible say one thing one place, and something else another, it's contrary to what He said first. It must be the same all the time.\n\nL-86 I'm omitting a lot of Scripture here on this, just because I see it's getting late. And our sister and them is having service here tonight, and we want to pray for the sick. That is, and find out, Billy, if they got some prayer cards.\n\nL-87 [Someone says, \"No service tonight.\"--Ed.] No service. Good. Good, good. All right. Now let's find it. All right. All right. [Congregation applauds] We trust that the Lord will bless this lady for this, letting us have this place, giving us this time.\n\nL-88 There is so many infallible proofs that Jesus is the place. He is the gate, He is the Name, and the only provided way that God has for man to meet in worship. He is the Way, the Truth, the Life; the Gate, the Door; the Alpha, Omega, the Beginning and the Ending; Rose of Sharon, the Lily of the Valley, the Morning Star; the Alpha, Omega. He is all, the whole thing put together. He is both Root and Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star. In Him dwells the fulness of the Godhead, bodily, where we in there are sons and daughters to God, in God's Godhead. Yes. As sons and daughters, we're in the family, if you're in there. [John 14:6], [John 10:7], [Revelation 1:8, 11], [Revelation 22:13, 16], [Song of Solomon 2:1], [Colossians 2:9], [Romans 8:17]\n\nL-89 Now how do we get into this great place to worship? That's the next question. How do we get into this place, if Jesus is the place? He is the Name of God. He is the place of God's worship. And He is the only door to the sheephold. And we want to find out how we get into Him then. [John 10:7]\n\nL-90 Now, if you're into the door, of course, you come in like the family, as we was talking the other day about, the... or at the breakfast, about the little sheep, that God would not close the door until He found that last little sheep and brought him in. If you've come in, then you become a family. You're a family of God when you've come into God. But you can't be a family of God and be Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, and Pentecostal. You can't do it. You have to come into Jesus Christ. [Luke 15:4], [Matthew 18:12-14]\n\nL-91 \"Well,\" you say, \"we did it.\" We'll see if you did it. Let's find out what the Bible says now. We find, in First Corinthians, the 12th chapter, the Bible said, \"By one Spirit are we all baptized into one Body.\" We're baptized into the Body of Christ, by one Holy Spirit. We're not shook in, we're not joined in, we're not baptized with water in. We are baptized with the Holy Ghost, into the Body of Jesus Christ. [I Corinthians 12:12-13]\n\nL-92 How long does it last when you get in There, until you misbehave yourself? Ephesians 4:30 says, \"Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption.\" Argue with Him, not me. That's what It says. I'm reading It. All right. \"You're sealed until the day of your redemption,\" until the day that Jesus comes for you. Then think of it! [Ephesians 4:30]\n\nL-93 You are then not yourself, you are a new creature, for the Greek there means \"a new creation.\" You've been re-created again. The power of God comes upon you, and you become created, a new creature; which brings the whole physical being, spiritual being and everything, in subject to the Word of God. Not no other way! [II Corinthians 5:17]\n\nL-94 How can you say that you're a Christian, and disobey His Word in one thing? Whosoever disobeyed the law in one--one part of It, was guilty of all of It. Whosoever! Jesus said, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.\" Not just part of the Words; every Word! That He said in Revelation the 22nd chapter, \"Whosoever shall take one Word out of this Book, or add one word to It, his--his part will be taken out of 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min the Book of Life.\" We are not to take away from the Bible, or add to It. Just say what It says. , [Matthew 4:4], [Revelation 22:18-19]\n\nL-95 And in First Corinthians 12, It said, \"By one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body.\" [I Corinthians 12:13]\n\nL-96 Now after you're in this Body, Romans 8:1 said, \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, that walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\" There is the place where there is no condemnation. Whether you go to a Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian church, wherever it is; if you are in Christ, you are a new creature, and there is no condemnation in you, no where at all. That's God's meeting place. That's where God meets the worshiper. There is where you are accounted a new creature, for they're dead to the things of the world. They're alive in Him. The living Presence of God is with them, day by day. [Romans 8:1]\n\nL-97 He lives in them, through every age. Every age that's come along, down through the Bible, when man meet God's requirement, comes into the place to where He provided in His written Word for that day, God makes that person to be a new creature, and he has no condemnation. Look at Job.\n\nL-98 Am I deafening you, the way I'm in these mikes? I'm sorry about it. I know it's the rebound in here. I hear it here, myself.\n\nL-99 But, look. Job, regardless of how many people try to condemn him, how many said he was wrong, he was keeping the commandment of God, by that burnt-offering. He knowed he was justified, because he was keeping the commandments of God. That's how he was justified, because he was doing the things that God wanted him to do. [Job 1:5]\n\nL-100 The living Presence of God lights up the day, every day, from death of creeds, and to Life and to the Word of the day. Now, God has things that He does.\n\nL-101 As a--a little flower, like I said the other morning at the breakfast. When a seed comes to light, he starts growing. It drinks from God's fountain, keeps pushing up till it gets to the bud part, gets up into the flower, up into the blossom.\n\nL-102 Now we find out, that when we start with Christ, we grow the same way, because we grow in grace and in admonition of God. [II Peter 3:18]\n\nL-103 God's only provided plan, for any age, is His Word. His Son came and manifested every promise that was promised for His age. All the prophets came just exactly on time, they was God's Word living on earth. They was the Word. Jesus said that they were \"gods.\" Jesus called those prophets, \"gods.\" , [John 10:34-35]\n\nL-104 A man met me in the last meeting I had, he said, \"You're a poor theologian.\"\n\nL-105 And I said, \"I don't claim to be one.\" I said, \"The Word don't come to a theologian; theology does.\" The Word comes... See? I said, \"Just theology comes to a theologian. But,\" I said, \"we're talking about something else.\" [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-106 Now we find that, in each age, when God said a certain, thing would happen, here come that man along and manifested that, here come their people along and lived that. That was God Himself living in the people, because it was an answering of His Word. [Romans 1:19], [Romans 8:19]\n\nL-107 Now, God's only provided and only provided plan, today, is His Son, through His Word for this age, quickened by the Spirit of His life, quickened.\n\nL-108 Now we have great schools of theology. And many times when we do that... Nothing against it, certainly not. But, you see, when you got a school of theology...\n\nL-109 Jesus said, in Saint John 4, \"The time is coming, and now is, when God, being a Spirit, will be worshiped in Spirit and in Truth.\" Now some people have Spirit, no Truth. Others has Truth, no Spirit. [John 4:23-24]\n\nL-110 So it's just like if we had a big car, we were going somewhere in a Cadillac. And both Cadillacs was made just alike, and we pushed them out here and we... up to the tanks, and we filled them both up with gasoline. And you crank and crank on one. Well, you look out, say, \"The seat is all right. The steering wheel is pretty, it's got diamond studs in it. And plush, sit... sets pretty. And you sit back and go to sleep. And, oh, a lot of things you could do, each one, but, you see, one of them... All of them has the right mechanics, but one of them has the dynamics. You see, you might 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min know the mechanics, but it takes the dynamics to start off the mechanics, to make them work.\n\nL-111 And that's what's the matter with the church today. We're full of theology, without any dynamics in it. That's right. See?\n\nL-112 In other words, you've got to have the spark to the gasoline, or the gasoline is no more than... It's not even as good as water, as long as it hasn't got the spark to fire it. So, that's the way.\n\nL-113 No matter how well we're taught, how well we'll believe, and how much of the Bible that we say is true, and we believe it all true, it's got to be the--the dynamics has got to be there, the spark, to set that Word afire and make it start rolling. It's got to have that. If you don't, the church sits still, the car sits still, you'll sit still. But no matter how much you say, \"I sympathize. I believe every Word of That.\" You've got to have something to spark that off, to make that one hundred octane go to firing, and the big Church of God go to moving on. It's got to take the dynamics with the mechanics. Nothing wrong with the mechanics, but lacking dynamics.\n\nL-114 And I think that's what's the matter with the church today, we're lacking that dynamical power, to press this Word and make It live for this day.\n\nL-115 Martin Luther had the mechanics and dynamics, of his day. John Wesley had them, of his day. Pentecostal had them, with their day.\n\nL-116 What about our day? This is another time! The Church should be fully grown now, ready to go meet Christ, with the manifestation of every blessing that He promised in the Bible, operating in that one great Body where He promised that He would meet the people and be worshiped, in this great Church of His.\n\nL-117 But, you see, we send our kids away to school, we learn reading, writing, arithmetic, all the history of the prophets and everything. That's alright, but unless you got something behind that!\n\nL-118 \"Oh,\" you say, \"well, I--I shouted. I spoke with tongues.\" That's good. I believe that, too. But that's not what I'm talking about yet. See, you'll--you'll... it'll splutter. You say, \"Plank-plank, boomp-boomp,\" like an old car trying to start. You say, \"Yeah, I believe this. I believe that, too. But, but when it comes to this, them days, oh, no. No!\"\n\nL-119 She's a hundred octane, brother, with a right kind of a generator behind her, it'll fire every Word of God to Its promise. That's right.\n\nL-120 That's what's the matter with us today, we almost come to a stop. We want to believe this, believe that.\n\nL-121 I say something, about This. \"Well, I don't know.\" Well, the Bible said so! That settles it. If God said so, it's there to be done. If we... If that's what God said do, we've got to do that. Just stay there till God fires it off, and directly you start running then again, you see. If you don't, you get the plugs all smutted up. And so we need something different, we need something to fire us off.\n\nL-122 Then notice, not only does He come in by the Holy Spirit, with the learning of His Word, He manifests that Word. Now remember, the prophets believe the Word. They receive the Word of God. And God the Holy Spirit came into them and fired that promise out, and made it come to pass. Oh, my! Who is going to condemn that? , [John 6:63]\n\nL-123 Jesus said, \"Who can condemn Me of sin? Sin is 'unbelief.' Whatever God wrote and whatever the prophets said, I'm the Answer. What they said I'd do, I do.\" He came as a prophet, the Son of man. That's exactly what He was, and what He proved to be. He was. Why? The dynamics was there to fire off the mechanics. He was the mechanics, the Son Himself, and the Father was the dynamics. \"It's not Me that doeth the works, it's My Father that dwelleth in Me. He splatters forth the--the--the dynamics and makes the thing move on. He brings it to pass.\" [John 8:46], [John 14:10]\n\nL-124 \"When did I ever say anything...\" Like Samuel said one time to the people, \"Have I ever told you anything, in the Name of the Lord, but what come to pass?\" See? \"When did I ever say it, and when did it not happen to come to pass?\" [I Samuel 12:3-4]\n\nL-125 \"Oh, you, what you told us come to pass, but we want the king anyhow.\" [I Samuel 8:19-20]\n\nL-126 That's the way it is today. People want to hold onto their petty ideas. They want to hold onto their creeds. They 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min want to hold onto it. Then talking about a revival in our day, how can we have a revival when it's all messed up the way it is? Watered gasoline and everything else in it, all kinds of detergents and all these modernistic things mixed into it.\n\nL-127 I was coming down the road one day, and it said, some kind of modern detergent, said, \"You don't have to wash the dishes, the only thing you have to do is dip them in there and dip them out.\"\n\nL-128 I thought, \"I'm going to be a hero in my house.\" I go and get me a box of this stuff. And I said to the wife, \"Go on in, honey, let me wash the dishes.\"\n\nL-129 I thought, \"Boy, them guys know what they're talking about, them scientists. I'll show her how. I'll, she'll... till she catches onto this, what I'm doing. Just dip it in and sit it out, that's all you have to do.\"\n\nL-130 The kids had eat eggs for breakfast. And I poured this detergent in there, and dipped it in, dipped it out, and dipped it in and dipped it out. It was still eggy. Yes, sir. I don't believe anything I hear on television, no more. No, sir. No, no. No, indeed.\n\nL-131 That's the reason I don't believe any man-made system can stand. God has got one provided way. It isn't Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian; but it's Jesus Christ, by the new Birth, believing that Bible. That's God's provided way, and the only way that He has, is in Jesus Christ, His Son. And, in His Son, He placed His Name. His! God's Name is Jesus, 'cause He came in His Father's Name. And so that would be God's Name, because He was God. [John 5:43]\n\nL-132 Now notice, when this great moving power of God comes into a son of God, it quickens him, the Spirit of Life enters into him. Then what does it do? It seats them in Heavenly places, right now. Not they \"will be.\" We are now. Now we've already resurrected, the dynamics and the mechanics is gone to work, quickened us, and we're quickened up into the Presence of God, where His Spirit is. And now we are seated together in Heavenly places, in Christ Jesus; in Christ Jesus, sitting in there, that great seat that's already fired up, been raised from the dead. We're a part of it. If you're a part of the Bride, you are, because the Bride is part of the Groom, you know. So we find out that it's the same thing, and She'll do just exactly what's predicted for Her to do in this day. She won't be a Laodicea, not by no means a lukewarm. But She'll be on fire for God, She'll be moving on in the Spirit of God. , [John 6:63], [Ephesians 2:1, 5-6], [Colossians 2:13]\n\nL-133 Now we're looking here now to find out. Now let us, now at this same time that it does, that this strikes us; and, when, we're once dead in sin and trespassing, trespasses, rather, he... we been quickened together unto His Word of this age. [Ephesians 2:1, 5]\n\nL-134 Now let us think about way back in the old times, of somebody that was quickened by this Word; just before we have the prayer service for the sick. Let's take a few characters, watch their characteristic.\n\nL-135 Let's take a man here that kept all the Word of God, back in the Old Testament, by the name of Enoch. He was so quickened by the Word of God, that he had a testimony, that, \"He pleased God.\" There wasn't one thing that God commanded Enoch to do but what he did it. [Hebrews 11:5]\n\nL-136 I wonder how many Enoch's would be here this afternoon, that, if you know it's in the Word of God? How many of you bobbed-haired women could call yourself an Enochist, see, see, and know that God condemns that? How many of you man, that let's them women do that, could call yourself an Enoch? Oh, my! That's just one thing, how about the thousands? And we smother down, say, \"I belong to this, and I belong to that.\" You may belong to that, but... till you come into God's provided place! And you can't get in there unless you become part of that Word. And, being part of It, you become all of It, subject to all. Notice, we have this here that the Bible calls \"the Word of God,\" and, which, it is the Word of God. [Hebrews 11:5]\n\nL-137 Now we find out that Enoch come into God's provided way, with His Word, and walked five hundred years, and pleased Him. And we find out that the mechanics was so perfect in Him, that when the dynamics got to working in the engine, It just took him off the earth. He took the first airplane flight, like, to Heaven. Working on God's mechanics and dynamics, together, \"he was not,\" because God took him out of the earth, without death. That's exactly right. He was walking in God's provided way. [Genesis 5:23-24] 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min\n\nL-138 The same thing we find out on Elijah. Old Elijah had bawled out so many of those painted-face Jezebel's, and haircuts, and so forth, that they were using of that day, the old man had spent his life just condemning sin amongst them women, because they had a woman, Jezebel, there to set a pace. [II Kings 9:30-37]\n\nL-139 Just about like your Hollywood here has, and got all the sisters all wound up into it out there. And, the Jezebel still lives, you can just look around and you can see she does. And she is still in great power, too.\n\nL-140 Now we find out, the old fellow being a prophet, he had cursed that thing and everything, stayed perfectly in the will of God. When all the rest of the preachers weakened off, he stayed right there with It.\n\nL-141 And one day he got so tired, that, God sent a chariot down from Heaven, and horses of fire, and took him up. He was so full of that quickening power! Just think, with the Word of God in his heart, he become so full of that quickening power that quickened him! , [II Kings 2:11]\n\nL-142 \"If the Spirit of God, He...\" I believe we find in Romans, 11, or one, 11... \"If,\" it says, \"if the Spirit...\" Romans 8:11, it is. \"If the Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead be in you, it will also quicken your mortal bodies. If the Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead, if--if It be in you, It'll also quicken your mortal bodies.\" [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-143 Quickened it! What does the word quick mean? The Greek word means, \"to be brought to life after death.\" Hallelujah. There's the gate of worship. Worshiping in the Spirit and in Truth, mechanics and dynamics, together. You see what I mean?\n\nL-144 \"If the Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, It will quicken, make alive, your mortal bodies, because It's already Life.\" And when It comes into your body, It brings your whole body subject to It. Subject to what? The Word of God. \"If it's in you.\" [Romans 8:11], [Ephesians 2:1, 5-6], [Colossians 2:13]\n\nL-145 Now if it's something in you, telling you, \"Well, that was the days past. And Mark 16 is not true, and that Pentecostal idea of the baptism of the Holy Ghost.\" That ain't the Spirit of God in you. I don't care how well you're trained, you, that's not the Spirit of God. You say, \"Well, my mother belonged to this, and my father, through years, and my brother.\" Whatever you want to say about your relatives, and so forth, that might have been all right with them; but it ain't for you, see, you've got to this day come into Christ Jesus, for this age and the promise that's meant for this age.\n\nL-146 Notice, we find out that this great quickening power struck Enoch, it quickened him and he went Home without dying. [Genesis 5:24]\n\nL-147 It struck Elijah, quickened him till he went Home without dying. We find out his successor was Elisha, which is a type there of Christ and the Church, Elisha. Elijah done four miracles, and Elisha done eight miracles. He had a double portion, like was poured out upon the Church. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Later they had a dead man, throwed it over on his bones, and he come to life. That quickening power was in the grave with him. You can't... , [II Kings 13:21]\n\nL-148 It's always there, when you get that quickening power of God, being quickened up with Him now. , [Ephesians 2:1, 5], [Colossians 2:13]\n\nL-149 Now remember, in Christ, we are flesh of His flesh, bone of His bones. When God wounded Christ at Calvary, He was wounded for me and you. We are flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone, body of His body, Name of His Name, Bride of Him. See, we are in Him, we are His flesh and His bones. [Isaiah 53:5], [Ephesians 5:30]\n\nL-150 And God has already raised us up, potentially. The quickening power that raised us from a life of sin, and changed our being, it has potentially raised us up in Christ Jesus, which, the resurrection will bring us forth in the fully maturity.\n\nL-151 Now remember, we died in our own name, was buried, and raised in His. See, we're no more of our own. Of which, that great Name of \"Jesus Christ\" which the Bible said over here in Ephesians 1:21, that, \"Both families, in Heaven and earth, is named after that Name.\" That's where God put His Name. That's the family's Name in Heaven. That's the family's Name on earth. [Ephesians 1:21] 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min\n\nL-152 And we're in Jesus Christ, by spiritual baptism, not by water; by Spirit, we are baptized into one Body, which is Christ, the worshiping place. Then, being in there, we are being on this ground, it's like the abstract deed. [I Corinthians 12:13], [Colossians 2:12]\n\nL-153 You say, \"I bought a piece of ground.\" It isn't yours yet until you got an abstract. But if you got an abstract, it shows that everything was ever against that piece of ground has been stricken off.\n\nL-154 And then when you've become a Christian and accept Christ as your Saviour, then, when God sends down the abstract, it shows that no matter what your father did, your mother did, what anybody else did; your mother, daddy might have been drunkards, prostitutes; whatever it was, every sin is stricken off! You've got an abstract title. There is nothing can put you off of it. And, look, everything that's on that ground belongs to you! Amen. And when you're in Christ Jesus, by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, every gift of God belongs in the Church. Amen. It's an abstract title deed. You, it's yours, it belongs to you. It quickens your mortal bodies. Oh, my, if we'd think of it! [Acts 2:38], [Ephesians 1:14], [II Corinthians 1:22]\n\nL-155 Let us take a look at those faithful ones at Pentecost. They were all in the upper room there, and they was all scared. They had, they had the--the title, alright, but they were afraid. \"And all at once there came a sound from Heaven,\" the abstract sent down to them, \"like a rushing mighty wind, filled all the house where they were sitting.\" And they were so quickened by That, till all their cowardliness they were... One of them was even afraid, they even denied he wasn't a Pharisee yet, or he wasn't a Sadducee yet. But when that Holy Ghost fell and baptized him into Jesus Christ, he became flesh of His flesh, bone of His bone, Word of His Word. He was a new creation. He was a new person. It quickened his body. [Acts 2:1-3]\n\nL-156 Look what It did, what It does to you when It comes in. It don't make you go out and say, \"I'm Methodist. I'm Baptist. Oh, I know I oughtn't to smoke. I oughtn't to have this. I oughtn't to wear these kind of clothes. I oughtn't to do this. I oughtn't to do that.\" It so quickens you till you have to do it. It quickens your mortal bodies.\n\nL-157 Look, It quickened their bodies, until they flew so close to Heaven till It quickened their body to speak in a language they never heard of before. It quickened their bodies, they spoke in new Heavenly language. They were quickened into the Presence of God, by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. God's quickening power baptized them into that. They were in the place of worship then. They were where they could worship. The Sanhedrin or nothing else ever could bother them, because they were quickened. They were new people. That's after they was baptized. [Acts 2:4], [Romans 8:11], [Ephesians 2:1, 5], [Colossians 2:13]\n\nL-158 Look at little Stephen. He come into God's provided way, was quickened by the power of God; come into the gate, God's provided way. And even when they went to kill him, stone him to death, he said, \"I see Heavens opened, Jesus standing at the right hand of God.\" That's quickening power. He was quickened up into His bosom. [Acts 7:55]\n\nL-159 There was Philip, another one full of the quickening power. We find him down there at Samaria, holding a great revival. This great quickening power, after he was in Christ, come where he had thousands of people listening at him. And He said, \"Now leave here, Philip, I want you to go out into this desert, Gaza, here. I got a man out there, want you to meet.\" And no question, no question at all, he was full of that quickening power. He was in Christ, he was in the provided place where God could talk to him. God spoke to him. There was no question. [Acts 8:5, 26]\n\nL-160 Say, \"Well, He spoke to me and told me I was going to be healed, but, I don't know now, I feel awful bad today.\" Oh, my! \"Well, He told me I had the Holy Ghost, and sometimes I sure doubt it.\"\n\nL-161 Philip knowed exactly the Voice of God, 'cause he had come God's provided way. He didn't question God, about, \"Well, God, I got so many here, I have to stand. I have to see the state presbyter before I can do it. I have to go talk to the bishop,\" wasn't nothing about it. He minded God, right out into the desert he went! [Acts 8:26-27]\n\nL-162 He found one man, a eunuch, an Ethiopian, a colored man coming down, reading the Scripture in Isaiah. And he said, \"Do you understand what you're reading?\" Said, \"How can I unless someone would teach me?\" [Acts 8:26-29] Philip got up on the chariot and begin to talk to him about the Lord. 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min He said, \"Here is water, what hinders me from being baptized?\" [Acts 8:36] He said, \"If thou believest with all thy heart, all thy soul and mind, strength.\" Got off the chariot and baptized him. [Acts 8:37]\n\nL-163 And Philip was so full of that quickening power, till, He caught him out of his sight. Think! In his mortal body, his physical being was caught up, out of the sight of the eunuch. I believe that to be the truth. God could take him somewhere else, where He had need of him. He was caught up. [Acts 8:39]\n\nL-164 You know, death can't even take that thing away from you, when you're in Christ, in God's place. [I Corinthians 15:55-56], [II Corinthians 4:14]\n\nL-165 Look here, Moses had it. He was a prophet that the Word of the Lord came to. No many... how many Korah's raised up and said, \"We need a great organization. Now you try to take the place of being the only holy man.\" God said, \"Separate yourself, I'll just swallow him up.\" And the Dathan's, and so forth, didn't bother him, he went right on. , [Numbers 16:21]\n\nL-166 And when Moses died and was buried, by the Angels, that quickening power stayed on him. For, eight hundred years later, here he is over in the promised land, talking to Jesus. That quickening power was still on him. That's God's place of worship. [Deuteronomy 34:5-6], [Matthew 17:1-3]\n\nL-167 \"What say? How did you know?\" He was a prophet. The Word came to the prophet. And he was the manifested Word of God for his age. Amen. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-168 See, you can't die, you're done quickened. Oh, if the church could only see that, that it's not what you're going to be, you already are! It's the Devil trying to rob you from that.\n\nL-169 \"Well,\" say, \"now I'll tell you. I belong to this.\" Don't care what you belong to.\n\nL-170 You've got to be borned, regenerated, baptized with the Holy Ghost, into Jesus Christ, quickened to every Word. Your Spirit, in you, will punctuate \"amen\" to every Word of the Bible. Outside of that, if it--if it shakes its head on one, you get rid of that spirit. It's not the Spirit of God that would dispute the Word of God. It'll keep the Word of God. Not only does it believe It, but It makes It live. It manifests the Word of God. Yes, sir. [John 3:3]\n\nL-171 Notice also them saints of the Old Testament. Potentially, under the old sacrifice, they were waiting for this new one to come, had a good conscience towards God. In Matthew 27, we're told that, when Jesus raised and come out of the grave. Which, we just celebrated a few weeks ago, Easter. The Bible said that, \"Many of the saints that was sleeping in the dust of the earth, raised up at His resurrection, and come into the city and appeared to many.\" What were they? They were manifestations of God's promised Word. The only place that God meets, under that sacrifice. [Matthew 27:52-53]\n\nL-172 Now in First Thessalonians 4:16, the Bible said, also, that the New Testament saints would come forth with Him when He comes again, them that's quickened into Him now. How do you get into Him? By spiritual baptism, the power of God, the place that He meets, in Jesus. Now Jesus is God's provided way. [I Thessalonians 4:16]\n\nL-173 Now notice, Jesus was so sure what He was! He knowed He was the Son of God. He knowed He was virgin born. He knowed that every Scripture manifested Itself right through Him. He knowed it so perfectly, till He said to them builders of the temple, that day, He said, \"You destroy this temple, and I'll raise it up in three days.\" Think of that. \"Destroy it, and I'll raise it up in three days.\" Why? It was a written Word of Him. [John 2:19]\n\nL-174 David said, \"I'll not leave My Holy One in hell, not leave His soul in hell, neither will I suffer My Holy One to see corruption.\" [Psalms 16:10]\n\nL-175 Now, Jesus knowed that that was He. No question in His mind. And He knowed that, seventy-two hours, the body corrupts, sometime within that seventy-two hours He was going to come back to life again, so He said, \"You destroy this temple, I'll raise it up again in three days.\" Why? The Word was written of Him. It was written of Him, because He was the manifestation of God's written Word for that day. [John 2:19]\n\nL-176 Well, there's got to be, hallelujah, there's got to be, brother, there somewhere, God's manifested Word of God 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min today. And that's the same thing, for He spoke of these days and He said what would take place in these days. He has already told us. We know what's going to take place. And we see it being manifested in you, then you're in God's Church. Outside of that, you could call yourself, \"Methodist, Baptist,\" or anything else, it'll never work. There was only one meeting place, that's in Christ Jesus. Oh, today, oh, how today that I would that everybody would see that, see how to get in, being baptized. The Bride is part of her Husband. The Church is a part of the Word, the manifestation.\n\nL-177 Now what church are you in? Are you in a denomination? If you are, I'll strictly tell you now, you're in Laodicea. But if you're in Christ, you're a new creature, and you're in the Church of the living God, with the manifestation of the very same things that He did in His day will be coming back here in this day, doing the same thing that He said It would do. Then, that is the real Church. You get into It by spiritual baptism, not by joining, not by some more, but by being baptized by the Holy Ghost into His Body. All right. It's God's only provided way that He has left for us to do, is to be baptized into His Body, by His Spirit. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-178 Jesus said, in Saint John 14:12, \"He that believeth, while he is in Me!\" No wonder people say the days of miracles is passed, no wonder they say these things. \"He that believeth in Me, not believe on Me, but believe in Me, the works that I do shall he do also.\" Why? It's His Life. It's His dynamics in His mechanics, that's in you, that fires it off, makes it go and do the works that it promised do. Or, my life in Him, has quickened me by His Spirit, to make His Word, which is the mechanics, work by His dynamics. Hebrews 13:8, \"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" [John 14:12], [Hebrews 13:8], [Ephesians 2:1]\n\nL-179 Now also in Mark the 17th chapter, the 30th verse, of Saint Mark. Listen close. Jesus promised these things in the last day, that He's \"the same yesterday and forever.\" He promised, in Malachi 4, that He would \"turn the hearts of the people, in the last days, back to the Faith of the fathers.\" He promised that. He promised, so many places in the Bible, the things that He would do. \"Yet a little while and the world seeth Me no more, yet you will see Me; I'll be with you, in you always, even to the end of the world.\" And notice in Saint Luke again, 17:30, \"As it was in the days of Sodom!\" [Luke 17:29-30], [Malachi 4:5-6], [Hebrews 13:8], [Matthew 28:20], [John 14:19]\n\nL-180 You know what happened in Sodom? Look at California; not only California, the United States; not only in the United States, but the world.\n\nL-181 Look at this teen-age insane! Why, we had a... I told you the other day, they was taking an analysis there of the schools in Arizona where I live, and eighty percent of the children in school is mentally retarded. What will their children be? We can't have another generation. We're at the end. Jesus said these things would come.\n\nL-182 Look at all the televisions and things getting these fictitious things in order. It'll come a time, I predict, that people will be completely, totally insane, the world will be. The Bible speaks of such hideous sights as they show in movies today of some prehistoric creature's age, that's lived in the earth for so many thousands and millions of years, hatch and come forth to some... That's just a minor thing, to what's going to happen. When hell is opened and the Devil comes out with all of his mysterious things, of women... or locust with hair like women, and teeth like lions. Why, the world will be completely, totally insane. It's not but just about one degree from it now. [Revelation 9:8]\n\nL-183 Oh, for the glory of God, for the Coming of the Lord Jesus, for the Holy Ghost, for the know-so, for the living Presence of the living God! , [James 5:7-8]\n\nL-184 Jesus said, in Saint Mark there, He said, \"In that day the Son of man will be revealed.\" Now, remember, not Son of God. He came in three sons' names: Son of man, Son of God, Son of David. When He was on earth, He come as Son of man, He was a prophet. Son of man is a prophet. Jehovah Himself called the prophets, Jeremiah and them, \"Son of man, what seest thou?\" Jesus come, because He had to come according to the Scripture, as Son of man. Moses said, \"The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet, likened unto me.\" And He had to be a prophet, Son of man. , [Luke 17:30], [Acts 3:22]\n\nL-185 But after His death, burial, and resurrection, now He has been Son of God, the supernatural, the Holy Ghost. , [Acts 2:33]\n\nL-186 But He promised, just before the coming of the end time, the world would get like it was in Sodom, when a Man 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min came down in human form; three of them, two Angels and God Himself. That was God. The Bible said it was. Now He came down and He manifested Himself there, by turning His back to the--the tent where Sarah was, and told Abraham what Sarah was thinking in the tent. That right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now, Jesus Himself said, \"At the day when the Son of man is being revealed,\" in other words, \"the Son of man, the ministry of Jesus Christ Hisself.\" [Genesis 18:2, 13], [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-187 The church will come through justification, through Luther; through sanctification, through Wesley; through the baptism of the Holy Ghost, or the Pentecostals; and go right on into the perfection of the Son of man, that when Husband and Wife will be the same-self persons. God will be so manifested into His Bride, His Church, till they will both be the same. They are one. Now you see where we're at. [Matthew 5:48], [Ephesians 4:13], [Ephesians 5:25-27, 30-32]\n\nL-188 Don't hold to them traditions and creeds. They were alright in their day, but the flower has bloomed to a blossom now. It's seed time. That's right.\n\nL-189 Jesus promised these things. Now when we see God make His promise live before us, and see that it's in us, and His Spirit is living in us; that is the only way of worship, only place of worship, the only true way you can worship, \"For there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.\" God made the promise. Jesus said, \"The things that I do, you'll do also,\" and what He would do in the last day. How it come through this age, neither light nor day, would be the--the like a darkened time, but said, \"The evening time, it shall be Light.\" [Zechariah 14:6-7], [John 14:12], [Romans 8:1]\n\nL-190 The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. The same sun rises in the east sets in the west, civilization has traveled with it. It traveled over three bodies of water, three forms of baptism. Oh, yes, from Asia, over into Europe; from Europe, over into England; and from England, over into the United States.\n\nL-191 And now we've come right straight back again, and here we sit this afternoon, on the West Coast, where the sin barrier of all the powers of darkness heaps in here. These movies and television casts, and man kissing women on there, and poisoning the minds of little girls.\n\nL-192 Did you know any man that kisses a woman is morally obligated to marry her? Potentially it's a sex act. Sure, it is. Yes, sir. What is it? It's the male glands in a man's lip, and the female glands. When male and female glands comes together, it's sex.\n\nL-193 Look on Hollywood, look at the little girls laying out here in the parks, and the boys wallowing around over these girls, and things like that, and even singing in choirs. And these Elvis Presley's, and so forth, that we have today, it's a disgrace to the name of America, to what our forefathers fought and bled and died for.\n\nL-194 But the hour is come that every kingdom has to give away, because there is a Kingdom of God that's established in the human heart, by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the Presence of Jesus Christ. And Christ will come to His Bride and will set up a Kingdom here on earth, that will never be diminished. How do you get into this Kingdom? You are borned into it. How do you know it? You just keep... How would you belong into a kingdom and disagree with the king? See, you would be... And the King is the Word. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelled among us. The same yesterday, today, and forever.\" [John 1:1, 14]\n\nL-195 How did they know He was the Son of man? He'd look out there upon the audience and perceive what they were thinking about. We know that's true. He is the same today. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] [John 4:18-19]\n\nL-196 Did Billy give out any prayer cards? That's one I forgot to ask him. Did he give out prayer cards? [Congregation says, \"Yes.\"--Ed.] Did he give out prayer cards? All right.\n\nL-197 I'll tell you. If you've got faith enough, I've got faith to believe that God, Who made the promise, can prove Hisself to be God right here, without any person coming to this platform. I feel to take the initiative, on account of the promise of the Word of the living God. Look at here, let me show you something. This quickening power, we're going to exercise It. Let me show you. How many believes you got that quickening power? [Congregation says, 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Well, what's the matter with your hands upon the sick?\n\nL-198 When them disciples received quickening power upon them, on the Day of Pentecost, what did they do? They went out and layed hands on the sick, and they recovered. Jesus said, in Mark 16, \"It'll continue on to the end of the world.\" How long, to the apostles' age? \"Go ye into all the world, preach the Gospel to every creature. These signs will follow them that believe; if they lay their hands upon the sick, they shall recover.\" That's the quickening power like was on Elijah's bones, Elisha's bones. And the same quickening power is upon the saints that raised them up. If that same quickening power is in us, lay your hands on the sick, they shall recover. [Mark 16:17-18], [Acts 2:1-4], [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-199 I've noticed here, I've almost quit having discernment, anymore, just lay my hands on the sick. I've been noticing when, my, things I never... I didn't get to one-third of the people, otherwise. This way, I get to more than I ever did get to. And I find out a better results, by just getting myself into God's arms, and saying, \"Lord God, You promised it. It's Your promise; it's not mine, it's Yours, and You promised You would do it. And I've seen You do it. And I'm going to believe You're going to do it, because I've been baptized into Your Body, and Your Spirit here to identify that that's the Truth.\" Amen. That's the place of worship. Then you get into a place, \"all things are possible.\" Then you get into a place that your--that your motives and objectives, for your achievements, is just exactly in the will of God. And when you lay your hands there and believe it, it's going to happen. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] [Romans 9:23], [Matthew 19:26]\n\nL-200 I believe, before one prayer card is called, or anything else, that God Almighty can tell me what you've got out there, and what you ought to do, and what you ought not have done. That's taking the initiative, right, I know that's right, but that's exactly what God would have us to do. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] How many would believe it if God would do it? [\"Amen!\"]\n\nL-201 There is not a person sitting in front of me that I know, that I can think of, or see anybody that I really know. How many knows, out here, we're all strangers, raise your hands. Know that I don't know nothing about you, raise up your hands. Anywhere in the audience, knows I know nothing about you. I guess it's everywhere, especially up in here. Now maybe the other people just... I don't know them. They just didn't raise their hands, but I--I--I don't know them, anyhow. I believe I do see Richard Blair sitting right here. I believe that's right. I can... It's dark down there. There is lights this way. I don't see.\n\nL-202 But look at here, I'm trying to tell you, that, when that quickening power comes into you, it's Jesus Christ. When Jesus layed His hands on the sick, they got well.\n\nL-203 When Jesus had quickening power to quicken Him, as a Man, He could look out and tell the thoughts that was upon the people, tell them what they were thinking about, what they done. Have His back turned to them, tell them the same thing, \"Why do you reason in your hearts?\" The woman touched His garment, He said, \"Who touched Me?\" He looked around and found her, and said, \"I perceive virtue has gone out of Me. Your faith has made you whole.\" That's Jesus Christ. That proves that where the church is, and what the real quickening power of God does to the human being. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Let's bow our heads just a moment. [Matthew 16:8], [Mark 2:8], [Mark 8:17], [Luke 5:22], [Luke 8:46]\n\nL-204 Dear God, we've had a fight with Satan this afternoon, on these microphones, knowing them people probably didn't get half of it, the bounding around on the... in the building like that. But I pray, God, that the Holy Spirit will take that which was meant to be, Lord, to let the people see that we're not some dead dragging bunch of hope-so's. God, we are alive now, quickened by the power of the resurrection of Christ. Jesus Christ lives in us. We believe that, Lord. , [Ephesians 2:1, 5], [Colossians 2:13]\n\nL-205 We claim no glory of our own. Like on Mount of Transfiguration, where every one of us is represented there; there was Moses, the one that died and raised again; there was Elijah, the quickening saints that'll be caught up at the last day. Oh, they seen then, when they looked back, they seen Jesus only. We know, Lord, we don't want people to see us. We're not here for that purpose. Far be it! 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min\n\nL-206 But, Lord, it does delight our hearts when we see Jesus glorified among us; when we see Him glorified, when we see His Word, which He is the Word; when we see we can read it here in the Bible, where He promised He would do it, then see Him work it right in us, O God, how it makes us feel humble, that we know that His living Presence...\n\nL-207 We haven't joined nothing or bargained for nothing. We just believe, Lord, unto Eternal Life. And you sealed us in there by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and quickened our bodies, and quickened our spirits, and quickened us then to see visions, and prophesy, and speak in tongues, see great signs and wonders take place. Why, it's the living God. We're into that Body. When, to the world, is foolishness to them that perish; but to we who believe, it's the power of God, unto Eternal Life. We thank Thee for it, Father. [Ephesians 2:1, 5], [Colossians 2:13], [I Corinthians 1:18]\n\nL-208 Now let it be known this day, Lord, that You are God, that You have never changed Your mind about one Word that You ever said. And You're the same yesterday, today, and forever, and the one--the one and only way that God has provided. The only Man that God ever put His Name in, was His Own Son Who carried His Name, Jesus; God, Jehovah, Saviour, Emmanuel, the Door to the sheepfold; He that Was, Which Is, and Shall Come; the Root and the Offspring, both Root and Offspring of David; the Morning Star, the Lily of the Valley. O God, how wonderful! No wonder Isaiah said, \"Counsellor, Prince of Peace, The mighty God, Everlasting Father.\" Oh, we have no other Father but You, Lord. You are our Father. You are our Mother. You are all that we are, all that we could ever be. We won't see nothing else but Jesus glorified! [Isaiah 9:6], [Hebrews 13:8], [John 10:1, 7]\n\nL-209 Father, I might have made a poor out of this, this afternoon, but take the semblance of my heart, and hear me, Dear God. And let it be said, this day, that Jesus Christ was glorified right here in this temple. Grant it, Father, for we ask it in His Name, and as I humbly wait with this audience, to see You move by Your Spirit. Amen.\n\nL-210 Now I want you to do this one thing for me. I want to ask you one solemn question. I want you to answer me as if it was the last time that you would ever answer anybody in your life. Do you believe it's the Truth? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Do you believe there is not a church or a denomination could be recognized in the Presence of God? Do you believe that? [\"Amen.\"] There is not a one. Only those that are borned into Jesus Christ, take on His Name! That's right.\n\nL-211 You take on His Name when you are borned in there, not by water baptism. Although you can be baptized in His Name, but that don't take on His Name. You take on His Name by birth, not by water. See, you're baptized into the Name of Jesus Christ, yes, sir, into fellowship; but you are baptized by the Holy Ghost, into Jesus Christ. So you can be baptized a hundred times, any way you wanted to, the other way, it'd make no difference. But when you're once baptized by the Holy Ghost, into the Body of Christ, you become a son or a daughter of God, and, \"Every Word is true!\" And, then, He did that for that purpose. [Acts 2:38], [Romans 6:3], [Galatians 3:27]\n\nL-212 As I said the other day, when God moved and struck the sun across the earth, He knowed them palm trees and everything was laying down under that earth. He... They were part of the earth at that time, so were you.\n\nL-213 And when He raised up the Son of God, on Easter morning, and sent forth the Holy Spirit, it was to quicken, also, that seed of Eternal Life, that He foreknew before the foundation of the world, that would be here. He knew this microphone would act like this this evening. He knew that you would have the attitude you've got. He's infinite. You can't imagine it with your mind, you've just got to accept it. But, let me say this one thing, that same God stands here, this afternoon, in His people.\n\nL-214 Whether you're a Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal, whatever you might be, don't you trust in some organization. Cause, they cannot be an organization... It's made up of too many different doctrines. It's made up of among... You have to be an individual, to God. You have to be an individual. God deals with you, not in your church. You are to live a right kind of a life in your church or congregation where you're worshiping at, you should live that kind of life that you should be. But you see, they draw creeds, and so forth, that you can't even enter their doors if you don't believe that. So how can God ever come in there, when His Word constantly is being manifested?\n\nL-215 How did Luther know about these baptism and--and restoration of the Spirit, when he was back in that day? The plant hadn't growed like that. Neither did Wesley know it. And neither does the Pentecostal know what's going on 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min today. Same thing, grows right away from you. That's right. It has in every age, and it always will.\n\nL-216 And I can prove, by the Bible, this is the wheat age. Remember, after this great revival... There has never been another organization rise since Pentecost. They can't be. It goes from the shuck to the wheat, and there is nothing else but the grain. That's the reason. Fifteen years... Usually, three years, and they got an organization of any revival. Ask any historian. But there is no organization after This. They tried to raise up a Latter-day Rain, but you see what happened to it. It can't. It's wheat now. Yes, sir. There is no more carriers. It's the real grain. Christ is among His people. Do you believe it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-217 Let's start from over here, on the bottom floor. I can't pick out in there, seeing there is so many of you. How many believe me to be His servant? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Have faith in God! How many over here believe that the same way, say, \"I believe it with all my heart\"? [\"Amen.\"] Now may the Lord God grant this to us, that you might see the quickening power. It's something, vital evidence, that proves it.\n\nL-218 Yes, somebody can say, \"Oh, this is That, this, that.\" But let it act.\n\nL-219 Now, it's totally impossible for me to know anything about you. You know that. I don't know but one person, I could look at, and that's Reverend Blair sitting out there, from way back east, I believe Arkansas or somewhere back in there. That's the only one in the audience, that I do see that I know. And God knows that's true. So it'd have to be something that...\n\nL-220 I just happen to see over here, this little lady sitting at the end there, has got a spiritual problem you are praying about. Do you believe that God will straighten out that spiritual problem for you, and make it right? All right, you can have it.\n\nL-221 Put your hand over on the other lady sitting to you, 'cause she's got stomach trouble she is praying for, too. Yeah. That right, sister? Raise your hands up if that's true. I don't know you, never seen you in my life. Two colored girls.\n\nL-222 Now, what's that? Isn't that just exactly like what He said He would do? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Just exactly.\n\nL-223 Here is a lady sitting, looking right down through here; sitting, looking at me. She has got heart trouble. Do you believe that God will heal the heart trouble? You was sitting there praying, \"I wish I could get there.\" Is that right? Wave your hand like this, it's right. How did I know what you were saying in your prayer? See, just believe. That's all you have to do, is believe.\n\nL-224 Here sits a lady right here that'll die right away if she isn't healed. She's got cancer. Do you believe that God will heal the cancer? Yes. You believe it? You, being that you was kind of slow putting up your hand, do you believe God can tell me who you are? Ms. Gunn. Now, if that's right, wave your hand like that, see. All right. Go home, Jesus Christ will make you well. \"If thou canst believe, all things are possible.\"\n\nL-225 That struck this lady sitting there with the dark hat on, looking at me. She also has cancer. Do you believe God will heal you? Do you believe it with all your heart? I'm speaking to Mrs. Miller. Do you believe that? I don't know the woman, never seen her in my life, and God in Heaven knows that's right. Amen. \"If thou canst believe!\" [Mark 9:23]\n\nL-226 Here is a colored woman sitting right over here on the end, had her head down. She was studying, she is studying about a loved one, somebody she is praying for. She come, actually, to pray... have him prayed for. No he isn't here, it's her husband. That's right. She... He's not here. He's at home. He's had an operation, hasn't he? That's right. He was bothered with sinus trouble, and so forth. That's true, isn't it? He's going to be all right. Your faith was strong for it. Do you believe that that's to be true? Amen.\n\nL-227 Can't you see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever? Ask those people. It's went plumb across the audience. Do you believe that He's here? Do you feel that quickening power in you? Well, that's the God that makes you well, friends. Do you believe it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] [Hebrews 13:8], [Ephesians 2:1, 5], 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min [Colossians 2:13]\n\nL-228 Now will you do one thing for me? For, how many in here is sick, let's see you raise your hand. Now it's going on five o'clock. Lay your hands over on each other, and let's just... Don't say a word now, just lay your hands on one--one another. I want you to do something.\n\nL-229 Say, the man sitting right back here, has got that growth on his back. Do you believe that God will take that growth off your back, sir? Do you believe that God will make you well? Young fellow, looking at me, and thought he was going to get passed by. Raise your hand up, sir. That's right. You believe with all your heart, God will take it off for you.\n\nL-230 Hallelujah! I challenge this whole audience, in the Name of Jesus Christ! If you could, if... Your conscience, don't let it be seared with unbelief, don't let it be flustrated. Can't you see the Son of man, the Son of man in the form of prophetic Message, returning back again in His Church, in prophecy, revealing Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever? It's never been done through the age, till this time. See? There is the proof of it. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-231 What is the Church? How do you get into It? When you're in there, everything that Jesus Christ was, you are, even to be a son and daughter of God. He become you that you might become Him.\n\nL-232 The thing of it is, you are scared to use it, or either you're not cooperating with His Word. Now, that won't do a bit of good, and I--I don't care what you do. If you don't come fully into that Word, it'll never work. Who can accuse me of something He said and promised in this day, and it didn't happen? Then don't throw your denomination at me, 'cause it won't work.\n\nL-233 Hallelujah! I feel, I know He's here. I'm positive He's here. I know that now there is quickening power enough in the Church to heal every person that's sitting here. Can you believe it? Well, then, will you? [Ephesians 2:1, 5], [Colossians 2:13]\n\nL-234 Do you believe in praying for the sick? Do you believe Jesus said, \"They lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover\"? All right, put your hands over on each other now. Don't pray for yourself. Pray for the next person. They are praying for you. Now quietly and reverently. [Mark 16:18]\n\nL-235 Lord, how I thank You, can stand here at this platform and--and preach a Word that's so contrary to the people's thinking today, till they would call It \"heresy,\" they would call It \"spiritualism,\" they would call It \"evil spirits,\" like they did, when, \"Beelzebub.\" But to see You right in the midst of this grand audience, this afternoon, turn right around and confirm and prove exactly what's been preached, that It is the Truth.\n\nL-236 God, these are Your people. The--the Devil has tried to mess up the microphones, he's tried to mess up the people's thoughts, he's tried to keep them from getting This. But I believe they'll get It, anyhow, Lord. I ask for them to get It. I ask for them to receive It. Grant it, Lord, these believers with quickening power, that when they... if they don't live to see Your Coming, that quickening power will raise them up at the last days. [Ephesians 2:1, 5], [Colossians 2:13]\n\nL-237 Grant just now that that quickening power will quicken their faith, Lord, to what they are doing. There is a believer got a hands on a believer, a body to a body, a power to a power. And it's the power of God, by a son of God or a daughter of God, by the Son of God. O God, may Satan turn this people loose! May they be healed this afternoon, by the resurrecting, quickening power of the Presence identified, Jesus Christ. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may it be so! [Ephesians 2:1, 5], [Colossians 2:13]\n\nL-238 Your hands on the people has got quickening power in them, if you've been quickened. Have you come to Life? Has Christ become real to you? Has the power of God been manifested? Are you in that Church, God's provided Church? How are you in It, how do you know you've been quickened in It? Your whole thoughts, your whole being, is in Christ now. And Christ is in the midst of the people, proving Himself alive, proving that He is here at the days of Sodom.\n\nL-239 With them hands of those people, that their lives have been changed from streetwalkers, from drunkards, from prostitutes on the street, to a genuine saints of God, quickened. Their hands is laying upon you. They're in the Church, by Holy Ghost baptism, the same power was upon Elijah's bones. That same power is laying upon your shoulder, upon 65-0425, God's Provided Place Of Worship, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 99 min your hands, upon your heads, that same quickening power; with Him standing here proving that He's alive from the dead, show Himself that He's alive, here now doing the very same things that He did when He was...?... Amen! [II Kings 13:21], [Ephesians 2:1, 5], [Colossians 2:13]\n\nL-240 Can you believe Him now? Can you believe that them hands layed upon you are godly hands, can you believe that Spirit that's quickening us now, making us act crazy to the world, do you believe that's His quickening power? Do you believe you're in His Church? Then, if you are, and believe that those hands that are laying on you are holy hands, commanded by God; then I command you, in the Name of Jesus Christ, to stand to your feet and accept your healing, everybody that's been sick. Oh, Christian, you realize what's taken place?\n\nL-241 Do you realize, out in that street yonder is millions of people walking these streets, today, that's nothing in the world but atomic fodder? Do you realize them people are dead in sin and trespasses, and lives are black; in churches all over, for a few little lectures or something on some kind of a keeping of a certain thing, and call it religion.\n\nL-242 Did you realize that you have been raised from death unto Life, and has been baptized into the Body of the living God that's quickened your body, where there is speaking in tongues and interpreting tongues, seeing Jesus Christ manifested among us? Why, sickness could not stand in such a group as this. Let your faith go to Him, believe Him! Say, \"Lord God, I believe with all my heart,\" and you will be made well. [John 5:24]\n\nL-243 Is there sinners here that would like to come into that Body? Raise your hands, and say, \"I have never come into It, I've never been filled with the Holy Ghost, but, Brother Branham, I certainly desire It this afternoon. Will you pray for me?\" Raise your hands. Don't be ashamed, you're in His Presence. Just look at the hands! Look at the hands!\n\nL-244 Now everybody that wants the baptism of the Holy Ghost, raise up your hands, wherever you are, that want It.\n\nL-245 Now you that's got the Holy Ghost, who is standing near them, lay your holy, consecrated hands upon them. \"If the Holy Spirit, that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwells in you, it quickens your mortal bodies, from death to Life.\" It brings the whole body into the subjection to the Spirit. Now let's bow our heads, and everyone pray for those people that wants the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And I do believe that God will fill each one of you, right now, with the Holy Ghost. [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-246 Why do we wait, friends? You're going to wait too, long, one of these days. This is the hour. Don't wait any longer. You're right here in this temple where you got all night to stay and pray.\n\nL-247 Dear God, I pray that You'll send the Holy Ghost again, like as a rushing mighty wind, fill all the house, after the perfect identification here, this afternoon, that You're living and with the people. In Jesus' Name. Amen. [Acts 2:2] Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O. Box 4951 Naperville, IL 60567 USA Email: thevoice1017@lwbcast.org http://www.lwbcast.org/ Proving His Word"}, {"id": "65-0426 - Proving His Word.txt", "text": "L-1 Let us bow our heads just a moment. Dear Heavenly Father, we are grateful that we are here tonight. We, we are grateful that we know Your Presence is here with us. Now we pray that You'll minister to each one of us, as we have need. We ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. (You be seated.)\n\nL-2 Just feels good to have these microphones alive. I was so sorry to kind of mess that up yesterday, the Message that I wanted you to get so bad.\n\nL-3 And I wanted you to be sure to see that. It's the--the anchor that we have. We are not anchored by a church. We're anchored in Christ, you see. He is that only Way. He is the only place of safety, the only place that God ever put His Name. And God said He would meet the people in the place He chose to put His Name; not in any gate, but in the gate that He chose. And in that place He would meet the people, and there only. And we find out that God never put His Name anywhere but in His Son, Jesus Christ, as the son always takes the name of the father.\n\nL-4 And now you say, \"Well, what does that apply today? Each one says, 'I'm in Jesus.'\"\n\nL-5 He is the Word. That, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\" Again, it's also written in Revelation the 19th chapter, when we see Him Coming, the Bride and Groom, His vesture dipped in Blood, \"His Name was called 'The Word of God.'\" He is the Word of God. [John 1:1]\n\nL-6 And, that's, He is the quickening power. He is the Holy Spirit is that, the--the dynamics that comes into the mechanics, the Words, that make it live. And it all has to work together, or it just won't work. It's got to take the whole Bible, the whole Christ, the full Gospel.\n\nL-7 I want to say, to this panel that I watched on television last night, knowing it was going to be on, and I watched it. I want to comment these brethren, the ones that was on that panel, such a masterly piece of answering questions! And I'm a very much of a critic, you know, anyhow, but there wasn't nothing to criticize there. It was absolutely genuine, and I could agree with that, one hundred percent. [Congregation applauds--Ed.] Thank you. Amen. Them answers was right to the point. I certainly did appreciate that. I only wish I had a film to show in my church at home. It was really nice.\n\nL-8 And I'm so thankful to know that--that God has dealt out in the other realms, besides our own Pentecostal group, and are picking up men, those seed of God, that's been laying out there all these years, waiting for the Light to shine across them.\n\nL-9 And it also gives us a warning, friends, to know that Jesus said, \"When this sleeping virgin had begin to come in to buy Oil, that was when the Bridegroom was coming.\" So we can see by that, when we see the Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, coming in to get the Oil, then that was the hour that the Bridegroom came. Let's remember that. [Matthew 25:10]\n\nL-10 I never had Billy, my son, to say such to me as he did just a few moments ago. He said, \"Daddy, I don't tell you what to do. I don't mean to impress you by anything, but,\" said, \"daddy, whatever you do, put all your time for them sick people.\" He said, \"I never seen so many sick people!\" Said, \"I gave out two hundred cards in just a moment or two.\" Said, \"There is so many people sick!\" He does very seldom ever tells me that.\n\nL-11 And then I come tonight with some little notes wrote down here, and some comments upon the oncoming judgment, and knowing that we're sitting here tonight with the very wrath of God jerking beneath us, and soon she'll swipe it up. And knowing that the wrath of God is waiting; just at the moment it will be said, it will be over, for millions. And knowing that in my heart, and knowing it to be so! And then we see so many sick, pressing and pulling.\n\nL-12 And I thought, \"Tonight, most of them are Christians.\" And let me say to this, you children of God. Whatever you 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min do, you let everything else go. You serve God, day and night, with all your heart. You, you can feel there is something wrong. You can tell it as you walk in the streets, you just... and wherever you go. You know, if you're spiritual; and I know you are.\n\nL-13 And I was talking to a man, Brother Stromei. I don't know whether Tony is here, or not. He, he was... [A brother says, \"Tony Salameh?\"--Ed.] Tony Salameh, Salameh, Salameh? No. I got the wrong Tony. [A brother says something.] No, that's the wrong Tony. This is the Tony of--of--of Tucson. What is his name? [Someone else says, \"Stromei.\"] Stromei! I know it's Salameh, Stromei, or some. I get all...\n\nL-14 In his store, the other day, was a man came in, was very striking, he was saying something that brought back a memory to me, when I... last time I was in--in India.\n\nL-15 Where, I think the Lord gave us the greatest crowd we ever had at one time, was in Bombay. We couldn't even find places nowhere to put them, tens of thousands and thousands of people.\n\nL-16 And just before we got there, there was a newspaper translated. Well, it was, India is a bilingual country, it was--it was the English paper. And said, \"Well, the earthquakes must be over, the birds are flying back to their home in their nests.\"\n\nL-17 A few days before the earthquakes come, that tore down the fences and things. The little birds find themselves shelters in the rocks, and build their nests; and in the afternoon or in midday, when the sun is real hot, all the animals stand around those rock walls, to get in the shade. And for two days, the birds stayed out in the trees, they wouldn't come to their nests; and two days, the animals, the sheep and cattle, they would not come around in the afternoon, or hang around those walls. They--they stayed out in the field and leaned against each other, for shade.\n\nL-18 Then all at once, an earthquake, that just shook the walls and tore down the buildings. And, see, if those little birds had been in there, they'd have perished. If the cattle had been standing beneath it, and the sheep, they'd have perished. God warning nature!\n\nL-19 A few days ago, down in Brother Tony's store, I was listening to a man there that said... When this earthquake taken place in Alaska, he was fishing down in what we call Stony Point, at Mexico. And he said, \"The birds wouldn't feed, and the fish wouldn't feed. There was something wrong. And, all at once, the earthquake broke loose.\"\n\nL-20 And the other day, when that one happened over in India, or wherever it was, he said he was fishing again. He thought, \"Well, it's strange. Those fish feed about this time. There is not a roll in the water, nowhere. The water is just as quiet, perfect time for the fish to feed, but they didn't feed. And all the birds that's usually out there, the gulls, picking up these fish and things, was all walking around on the bank, huddling one against another. In a few moments, the sea moss from the bottom begin to come up like that, an earthquake had happened across the other side of the earth.\" See, them fish knowed there was something wrong, something was fixing to happen. Those birds knew the same.\n\nL-21 Surely, if God gives a fish and a bird discernment, how much more should He give His--His children! We know that we're at the end time, and judgment is waiting, so let's be real reverent. Flee to God with all your heart! \"O Capernaum, thou who art exalted into heaven, will be brought down into hell,\" and today she lays beneath the bed of the waters. Just remember, and pray. [Matthew 11:23]\n\nL-22 Now, tonight, I want to read a place here in the Scripture, just for a few moments. We're going to pray for the sick. Billy said he give out a bunch of prayer cards. And he gave out some yesterday, and I never got to any of them last night. And I wondered, when the Holy Spirit came... It's just... You can't make It work. It's just like a little lever, you pull yourself into a gear. You're the one does that operating of the Holy Spirit, not me. You do that yourself. So I, last night, I noticed even in discernment, it never picked up with the people just right. They didn't seem to take to it. I have found it, here lately, it seems like, more or less, just as I was speaking, laying hands upon the sick, they know.\n\nL-23 We should realize that in us has been given, we who believe Jesus Christ and been born of His Spirit and filled with that quickening power, that power that's in you. By laying on hands, on the others, like the disciples did and down through the age, It absolutely healed the sick, raised the dead, It showed visions, prophecies. And the very same Spirit 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min that lived amongst the early apostles is living in the church today, working the very same things. And as quick as we can recognize that! See, no matter how much it's a working, you've got to recognize that and believe that. It won't do one bit of good, until you do believe it. But the moment you believe it, your troubles are ended. That's true. [Ephesians 2:1]\n\nL-24 Now let us turn in the Scripture. I was sitting out there, a few moments ago, jotted down a few more Scriptures, to change my text for the night. And I want to read some out of the Word of God, out of the Book of Saint Luke, the 8th chapter, beginning with the 40th verse. Listen now, I'm going to read extensive. And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him. Would not that be a fine attitude for the company tonight? And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house: For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him. And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any, Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched. And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? ... Jesus said, Somebody has touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me. And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and fell down before him, and declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith has made thee whole; go in peace. And while he... spake, there certain one came from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master. But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole. And when he was come into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter,... James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden. And all wept,... bewailed her: and he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but asleep. And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. But he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called the maid, saying, Maid, arise. And her spirit came again, and she rose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat. And her parents was astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done. [Luke 8:40-56]\n\nL-25 Now let us pray. Dear Heavenly Father, as we read this Word, we know that that is truth. This happened. It's not some mythical story that we would read out of maybe a newspaper or some book of fiction, but this come from the Book that we know to be the Word of God. We believe it happened. We believe that this Jesus that did this notable thing, two instances here, of the woman with the blood issue, and the dead child, we believe that He is God's Son, that God raised Him up from the dead and has presented Him to us, tonight, in the person of the Holy Ghost.\n\nL-26 And we believe that He is here with us tonight. And believing that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, His compassions reach out to the people. And as the people reach for Him, the same results that was given in that day will be given this day. Grant it again, Father, that we might have a fresh anointing. As Brother Shakarian asked so sincerely, a while ago, and asked the audience to believe, we are asking again in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nL-27 I want to speak just for a few moments, and that will be just a few moments, 'cause I want to get them people with the prayer cards up here and pray for them. And omitting any other thing but just praying for the sick. But before we pray for the sick, we've got to get the people in that attitude. It's the attitude that always brings the results. It's the 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min attitude that you take towards God.\n\nL-28 Here is a woman touched His garment, she was healed, with a blood issue. A soldier spit in His face and put a crown of thorns on His head, and felt no virtue. [Matthew 9:21]\n\nL-29 It's your approach. The attitude is what it takes. And that's what it is tonight, dear friend, it takes the attitude. We are, and believe that we are, in the Presence of Jesus Christ, but it's your attitude that brings the results. The mechanics is here, and so is the dynamics. If you can just get started, God will do the rest.\n\nL-30 Now, this subject that I want to speak on, for a few moments, is: Proving His Word. Now that's a great thing, to think of that: Proving His Word.\n\nL-31 Now God is just as able to prove His Word, tonight, as He ever did prove It. And the Bible also said, \"Prove all things. Hold fast to that what's good.\" [I Thessalonians 5:21]\n\nL-32 Now you've heard, no doubt, heard the old proverb, \"Prove it, I'll believe it.\" But that doesn't hold true. Many times I seen many things proved, that was absolutely scientificially even proved, and yet people didn't believe it anyhow.\n\nL-33 I was talking with a man, here not long ago. We was talking about Divine healing. He said, \"I wouldn't believe it. I don't care what would happen, how much proof you could show of it, I still don't believe it.\" Well, certainly, no matter what you'd ever do for that man, he--he's lost. He cannot believe. There is nothing in him, to believe.\n\nL-34 I just had a--a little experience here, about a week ago, as you all know that I--I hunt. And when I come back from my meeting, I been lion hunting. And after I moved into Arizona, it's good, I like to hunt big game, and I like to get out amongst nature and watch it.\n\nL-35 Now, I'm not a killer. I just hunt. So, I--I don't like to destroy game, I--I don't think it's right. I think it's just as much sin to kill game, when you're not using it and going to use it for a purpose, as it would be to kill anything else. I believe it's wrong. We shouldn't do that. God gave it to us for food and for purposes, and we should not destroy it. But now what the law says you can take, all right. Just don't waste it.\n\nL-36 And I down there, the season is out for everything else. Lions kill a lot of cattle. And I know a lot of ranchers up in the country. And every time they get a kill, why, they call me, when a lion gets amongst sheep. A certain friend of mine, the other night, lost about thirty-five hundred dollars, in one night, by one lion killing just lambs. He got in, and, course, the rest of the lions are going to have to pay for his sin. And so I got the lion, and so it was a great big lion, and nine-foot long, and weighed close two-something, so it was--it was a good big lion.\n\nL-37 And then I went from the country of Arizona, up into Utah, to hunt. And so I was told that there was people up there, that a man that I was going to hunt with, was a government trapper, \"And, for goodness sakes, don't mention anything about religion, around him.\" Said, \"He was really a rough fellow.\"\n\nL-38 And I said, well, I told the man I was going with, I said, \"I won't mention it.\"\n\nL-39 He said, \"Don't say 'preacher.' If you do, you'll never get to go hunting. He wouldn't take you.\" Said, \"I hunted with him three days, and slept with him every night, eat with him every day, and he never even said, 'Good morning. How do you do? You want something to eat? Wash the dishes.' Nothing!\" Said, \"Now just don't say nothing about it.\"\n\nL-40 I said, \"I won't say a word.\" So I didn't tell him I wouldn't pray, but I just kept on tell him that I'm... And I pray.\n\nL-41 So when we got up there, the man was a very hard character, and I didn't think he believed anything. And he had just lost a baby a few nights before that, a stillborn baby. So, we went hunting. And on the second day, the man I was hunting with had told him, said I get to hunt everywhere around the country. So when the other hunter, was with me, had left, we were way in top of peaks; where we just run a lion, till we got him into the rocks, and he had got away. And so we were sitting there waiting for the dog to return. And this man said to me, he said, \"The other hunter, your friend, tells me that you get to hunt everywhere. You got plenty of money?\" Said, \"I guess it's none of my business.\"\n\nL-42 And I said, \"No,\" I said, \"it isn't plenty of money.\" I said, \"I--I'm sponsored.\" And he said, \"Oh, I see.\" He said, \"Well, I guess it's none of my business again, but,\" said, \"are you with a firm that 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min sponsors you?\"\n\nL-43 He was pulling it right out of me. I promised I wouldn't, see. So I said, yeah, I said, \"No, sir. I'm a preacher, a missionary.\" He said, \"A what?\" I said, \"Missionary.\" And he just stood and looked at me for a few minutes.\n\nL-44 I said, \"Do you have any hope for Life hereafter? What is your hope?\" He said, \"I'm a Jack Mormon.\" And I said, \"A what?\" He said, \"A Jack Mormon.\" I said, \"What kind is that?\"\n\nL-45 Said, \"The one that swears and drinks coffee, and smokes cigarettes.\" I said, \"Well, an honest confession is good for the soul.\"\n\nL-46 And then he said--he said, \"I want to ask you something.\" He said, \"I am told that the Mormon church is the only true church there is.\" He said, \"Do you believe that?\"\n\nL-47 I said, \"When it comes to church, I guess it's as good as any of them. I only know one Truth, and that's Jesus Christ.\" I said, \"I know He is True.\"\n\nL-48 \"Well,\" he said, \"I had a baby born the other night, stillborn.\" He said, \"I am told that this baby, because it was stillborn, God never did breathe the breath of life into it, that I'll never see it again.\" He said, \"What do you think about that?\"\n\nL-49 \"Well,\" I said, \"You won't as a Jack Mormon, you sure won't. That's one thing sure, you won't see it as long as you stay a Jack Mormon.\" And he said... Well, he had been pushing me, so I push him back a little bit, you see. We had--had time to push back. So he said--he said... I said, \"What's the matter?\" He said, \"Oh, I don't know.\" And he said, \"Well, what do you think?\" I said, \"I am acquainted with many fine...\"\n\nL-50 I didn't know he was a Mormon. And I was a very... I know, being it in Utah, it probably was, but I... 'cause most the people up there are Mormon, around Salt Lake City. This wasn't Salt Lake City, however. So I thought, \"Well, I've had some fine Mormon friends, been in the prayer lines, fine people.\"\n\nL-51 And I said, \"I have met some very fine man who are--are Mormons.\" And he said, well, he said... I said, \"I don't know their teaching on that, and I wouldn't want to say something contrary to their teaching, because that's what you are, and I respect that highly.\" And I said, \"Well, and you believe that?\" He said, \"Yes, sir, I do. But,\" said, \"I don't live to it.\"\n\nL-52 I said, \"Well, I believe that the Bible teaches that God knew that baby, millions of years ago, before the foundation of the world.\" I said, \"God told Jeremiah, 'Before you was ever conceived in your mother's womb, before you ever was come forth from the belly, I knew you, sanctified you, and ordained you a prophet to the nations.'\" I said, \"That's how much He knew about it, see.\" He said, \"Well,\" he said, \"thank you.\" [Jeremiah 1:5]\n\nL-53 He started walking down the hill. And then he met with this other fellow, and he said, \"Why didn't you tell me that guy was a preacher?\" And so we... He talked to him a little bit and begin to tell him about the meetings.\n\nL-54 Now, Mormons believe prophecy. I don't... might not be any here, but they--but they do believe in--in prophecy. But, so, maybe I'm talking out of school, but I... Yeah. Yeah. But, however, they believe.\n\nL-55 And he say, he come back to me, said, \"I understand that you are a prophet.\" I said, \"No, sir.\" I said, \"I... The Lord has showed me a few things to happen.\"\n\nL-56 And he took off, right away, said, \"Let's go in.\" And he got in his car, and went down to the... There was a little city from where he lived. In a few moments, he was missing. We was fixing the dogs, to take another hunt right after 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min lunch. And when we did, why, he took off in a car.\n\nL-57 In a few moments, a fine-looking young man come back, about seventeen years old, a real saintly-looking Christian gentleman. He said, \"This is my brother.\" Said, \"He is not a Jack Mormon. He is a real Mormon.\" I said, \"How do you do, son?\"\n\nL-58 And he said, \"I understand, that my brother tells me, that you are a prophet.\" I said, \"No, sir.\" I said, \"It isn't that I am a prophet.\" I said, \"The Lord has showed me things to come to pass.\"\n\nL-59 He said, \"I have a shot in my arm right now, I'm supposed to be on the operating table.\" He said, \"But my brother told me this. And I said, 'If that's so, I don't need the operation.'\" He looked me right straight in the eye, an honest, true, sincere look, said, \"You lay your hands upon me. If these things are so, I won't need the operation.\" He went home well.\n\nL-60 This brother, Christian friend of mine, was hunting with me, from Phoenix. He said to me, he said... Some of these boys are sitting right here now. One of them I know is here present. We went home. He said, \"Brother Branham, if the Lord would show you a vision and let you tell them Mormons just what's going to happen, that will do it, because they are looking for it.\"\n\nL-61 So, I prayed and I prayed. And on my road back home, I was coming up, on the following Monday, Sunday, about ten o'clock, I was standing in the room, after church that morning, and was looking out.\n\nL-62 And I saw flashlights flashing, or some kind of a light flashing. And I saw a lion that was in a tree, and--and it was too small for me to shoot. I didn't want it. And there was someone else shot it, and, when they did, they shot it with too big a gun. It blowed the lion up. I didn't appreciate the--the--the way it was done.\n\nL-63 When I got up to Phoenix, I told Brother Dawson that, and Brother Mosley. I know he is here. I seen him the other day, somewhere here. And he was going up with me, he and his wife. And I said, \"You watch and see, that's THUS SAITH THE LORD. It's going to happen that way.\"\n\nL-64 Nights we waited, four or five nights, we had hunted, or days. Seldom you ever tree a lion at night. Happened to be, coming home, they turned the dogs loose, this hunter, this Mormon boy. And the--the lion struck a trail, or the dog struck the trail of the lion, rather, and run him up in a tree. And at ten o'clock at night they come, got us out of bed. We went out there, and there was that same lion in the tree. Flashing the lights, Brother Mosley shot him with about a forty-four caliber, liked to have blowed the lion half in two. And there it was, just exactly the way it was said.\n\nL-65 The next day, I met the chief game warden of the state, another Jack Mormon. Took those boys together, leading them back home to Christ.\n\nL-66 I tell you, He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. God proves His Word to be so.\n\nL-67 You've heard people say, \"Seeing is believing.\" That's not altogether true. Many people see and they still don't believe.\n\nL-68 The days that Jesus was on earth, why didn't they recognize Him, that He was that Word of God made manifest? Why didn't the people realize that Moses said, \"The Lord your God shall rise up a prophet likened unto me\"? And He fulfilled every Word that the Bible spoke that He would do, but they didn't believe it. [Deuteronomy 18:15-18], [Acts 3:22], [Acts 7:37]\n\nL-69 But God, in every age, has proved His Word to be true. He always proves His Word. Then they say sometimes, that, \"Seeing is believing.\" It isn't so. But we know that God goes right on proving His Word in every age.\n\nL-70 We know that He proved it to Adam and Eve, that when He said, \"The day you eat thereof, that day you shall surely die.\" We have to admit to that, that that's truth. We believe that, for He has proved it to us, and we know that it's the truth. [Genesis 2:17]\n\nL-71 Now we'll just take some places that God did prove His Word. Let's take, for instance, in the days of--of Noah. God spoke to Noah a message that certainly was unscientific and unbelievable. No one could have believed. It had never rained upon the earth. Unscientific! [Hebrews 11:7], [Genesis 6:14, 22] 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min\n\nL-72 Perhaps they were a greater scientific age then than we are now, because they built pyramids and sphinxes, and so forth, in those days, that we can't build now. They was acquainted with a power, of some kind of a mechanical power, perhaps atomic or something, that they could lift those big boulders, that we couldn't do it today. But they did great scientific things. They had something they could embalm a body, to make it look natural for hundreds of years. We've lost that art.\n\nL-73 Jesus said, \"As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man.\" And we know that we are to enter into another great scientific age. [Luke 17:26]\n\nL-74 And now the message that Noah had was very much contrary to the belief of that day, in the church, and it was also very much contrary to the scientific research. But God proved His Word to be the truth. God proved that what that prophet said was the truth. [Hebrews 11:7]\n\nL-75 Also we'll take another for just a moment. Abraham was another prophet of the Lord, that the Word came to. And told him, when he was seventy-five years old, and Sarah was sixty-five years old, that he was going to have a child by Sarah. Now, that was quite a shock to an unbeliever. Could you imagine, today, such a thing happening even in this day, with all of our scientific achievements, and all these test-tube babies they talk about, and so forth? But this old woman, now of sixty-five years old, and an old man of seventy-five years old, but the Word of the Lord came to Abraham and told him that this was going to happen. And Abraham believed God. Now, no matter how much God spoke, and how true it was, Abraham had to believe what God said, to make it so. Now look how that man was tested, with his testimony, that he did believe. [Hebrews 11:8-11], [Genesis 21:1-7]\n\nL-76 That same man that made that confession, that he believed God, he's a person like you are, sitting here tonight. We still believe God. We got to believe His Word is the Truth. And He'll prove it, that It's the Truth, if we'll just believe it.\n\nL-77 Now look at the hindrance that Abraham had. First thing was his age, seventy-five years old, and Sarah being sixty-five. She was way past the change of life, the menopause. No doubt but what it stopped, many years before. He had lived with her as a wife. It was his half sister, had probably taken her when she was just a girl in her teens, and had married her. And he had had no children. She was absolutely barren. And now we find that, to do this, he had to separate himself from all of the peoples who did not believe it, in order to make it come to pass. [Genesis 21:1-7]\n\nL-78 I don't mean to say you have to separate yourself from peoples. But you have to separate yourself from all the gossip of unbelief, and stay away from that. When people says, \"Ah, those things don't happen! That's a bunch of lunatic people! There is no such a thing as that happening,\" just close up your ears and walk away. Don't pay any attention to it.\n\nL-79 The Bible said that \"Abraham staggered not at the promise of God, through unbelief; but was strong, giving praise to God.\" His name was changed from Abram to Abraham, the changing of the name made his name, \"father of nations.\" Could you imagine a man living with his wife, his sweetheart, that he had lived with her now for all these years, and now somewhere in the age of eighty years old, and his wife seventy years old, and yet without one child or any hope of child, yet claimed that he was the \"father of nation.\" Could you imagine the criticism of his passing fellow man would say, \"Father of nations, now how many children do you have at this time?\" And all the criticism he had to go through with! [Romans 4:20]\n\nL-80 But Abraham didn't stagger anywhere at all, of unbelief. He believed that God was able to perform that which He had promised, that God would prove His Word, no matter how long it took. But instead of getting weaker each time, like we are prone to do, he got stronger all the time. \"If it didn't happen today, tomorrow it will be a greater miracle, 'cause it's one day older.\" That was God, that was God in Abraham, for he knowed that God proved all of His Words to be so. [Romans 4:20]\n\nL-81 If His children will only take His Word, so He can prove It by you! That's the only way He can prove His Word.\n\nL-82 He doesn't prove It to unbelievers. They can't be proved; they are unbelievers. But, It's not to unbelievers. It's not for unbelievers. 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min\n\nL-83 It's to him that believe. And if He can find somebody who will believe His Word, He will prove His Word by you. And sometimes sickness and things happen to us that way, that God can prove Himself.\n\nL-84 Do you remember the blind man that Jesus found? They said, \"Who sinned, he or his father, his mother?\" [John 9:2-3]\n\nL-85 He said, \"In this case, neither, but that the works of God might be made known.\" See, it happened to the boy so that Jesus could be glorified. Sometimes sickness is not a curse, it's a blessing, that we can stick our faith out there and call those things which are not, as though they were. God said so, and He'll prove it's so if you'll just not weaken under the test. [John 9:4]\n\nL-86 He could prove Job, one time, that he wouldn't curse Him to His face. Look at the trial that Job went through. But down in the very jaws of death, he yet said, \"The Lord gave, the Lord taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord!\" He certainly believed it. God proved His Word to Job. He proved it to Abraham. He proved it so. [Job 1:21]\n\nL-87 Also He proved it by Moses. And when Moses, when the difficulty was so against him, Moses had it in his mind, that perhaps, to be a deliverer, that his mother had probably told him he was born a proper child. She--she was his tutor that raised him up in Pharaoh's palace, no doubt had told him, \"Son, we have prayed that we'd be delivered, and we believe that you are that child that God will use to deliver.\" And then when he... [Hebrews 11:23]\n\nL-88 See, he come up and was to be the--the son of Pharaoh's daughter, and we find out that he was to be heir to the throne. Why, no doubt it was in their mind then, that he would become the next Pharaoh, \"And that's how he would deliver the people, by being the next Pharaoh.\" But God had a... If that would have been so, then he would have done it through a material, through a--a--a act of politics. But God doesn't always work like that.\n\nL-89 God has His own ways to work, and He said He would \"bring them out.\" He told Abraham, \"After four hundred years,\" He would \"bring them out, with a mighty hand,\" He would \"show signs and wonders.\" So he couldn't do it like that, so Abra-... We find out that Abraham believed God, and here is Moses now believing God. [Genesis 15:13-14]\n\nL-90 And Moses looked out of the same window that Pharaoh did, he saw the same people. That Pharaoh looked out upon them, as, \"A cursed people, a people that had nothing but a bunch of fanaticism, for a God, and some desert God somewhere that they knowed nothing about; some unseen post that they pray to, that there wasn't nothing to it. They're a bunch of fanatics. And they were a bunch of slaves. And their God letting them be slaves, proved that He wasn't God.\"\n\nL-91 And right in the midst of the whole thing, He was raising up the very man. God does things in such peculiar ways, right up under them. Not a theologian, not a teacher, not a priest, not one of their holy men; but just an ordinary man, born for the job. And God called him to be His prophet, and sent him down there. And nothing in his hand but a crooked stick, to face an army, mechanized units that had conquered the whole world. But with that stick in his hand, as God told him to hold that stick in his hand and he would deliver Israel, and he went down and did it because God promised it. How is he going to do it? \"I will be with you.\" [Exodus 3:10-12]\n\nL-92 He said, \"Show me Your glory, Lord. I'm slow of speech. I can't talk right. And I...\" He had a million excuses. [Exodus 4:10]\n\nL-93 But He said, \"I'll be with you.\" And that's all it took. He went, taking God's Word. No matter how dangerous the task seemed, Moses continued to believe God. And God proved His Word, through Moses, to be the truth. Because, regardless of what took place, Moses stayed right with the Word. In the time of the journey... [Genesis 3:12]\n\nL-94 God told them, down in Egypt, also, that He would deliver them, \"Into a promised land, a good land, full of milk and honey.\" And it was absolutely there. They didn't know it was there, but He said, \"It's there, and I have given it to you. It's already yours, just go claim it!\" [Genesis 3:8]\n\nL-95 And in the wilderness, when many of them come out, dancing in the Spirit, when Miriam beat the tambourine; eating manna out of Heaven; listened at Moses sing in the Spirit; watching the miracles and signs go forth. But when it come to a showdown, to believe the whole Word of God, all the promise, they failed. [Exodus 15:20-21] 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min\n\nL-96 Only two of them believed it, that was Joshua and Caleb. And they brought back the evidence that the land was good. [Numbers 13:30-33]\n\nL-97 But, the circumstances was, that's what was what hindered them. Because, they said, \"We're not able to take that land, because their cities are walled, their--their--their delegates there. Not their delegates, but their--their people are a great giants. Why, we look like grasshoppers, up aside of them.\" [Numbers 13:26-33]\n\nL-98 Joshua and Caleb said, \"We are more than able to take it.\" Why? God had give it to them, no matter how big the giants was. The obstacle meant nothing to them. God had said so! And God proved it by them. And they did go over and take the land, as God said they would do it. He proved it to them. [Numbers 13:30]\n\nL-99 Now, when they come up in the month of April, when the waters was flying down out of the mountains, over the snowdrifts, and so forth, and looked like that God was a poor general, to lead His army right up to a place, He had them pinned off from the promised land. And the very time He taken them over, was going to take them over, it was the worst month in the year. The month that the Jordan was overflowing its banks, run plumb out into the fields. Why, if they was going to take them over, it would be in the summertime, when they could wade across. But He waited till the waters got deep. He likes to show that He's God. He likes to prove His Word, regardless. [Joshua 3:15-17]\n\nL-100 Don't care whether the doctor said, \"You're dying with cancer.\" That's all the man knows. Maybe the waters are deep for some of you, tonight. But, remember, God made the promise. God keeps His Word, and God proves His Word. It's the Truth.\n\nL-101 He waited till the waters got muddy, until they got deep and over their heads, and so forth, and then He opened up the way. He went before them and made the way. [Joshua 3:15-17] How they going to get in, the Jericho, when it was all closed over? Joshua was wondering. He knowed God had led him that far, the next step belongs to God.\n\nL-102 One day, when he was out walking around, viewing the walls, he seen a Man standing with His sword drawed. And he pulled his sword and went to meet the Man, he said, \"Who are You for? Are You with us or are You for our enemy?\" [Joshua 5:13], [Joshua 3:13]\n\nL-103 He said, \"I am the Captain of the hosts of the Lord.\" And He told him what to do. How is he going to blow a trumpet and a wall fall down, that they could run a chariot race across it? What would have anything to do with a trumpet? [Joshua 5:14]\n\nL-104 God uses such simple methods. It's so, the simplicity of it, what makes it God to me. We're always trying to find some great something, is going to do something, and God... some great organization is going to take the whole thing and clear it all out. When, God takes a simple person, just one man that He can hold in His hands, and He'll prove every Word that He said, by It. Takes such simple little methods!\n\nL-105 \"Sound a trumpet.\" Not dig out the wall, but, \"Just sound a trumpet, and the walls will fall down. The blast of the trumpet will knock the walls down.\" How foolish to the carnal mind! But God proved His Word was true, for the walls fell down, one on top the other. They went straight up and they took the city. [Joshua 6:20]\n\nL-106 Oh, God likes to prove Hisself to be God! Joshua knowed that. One day, and when he was standing there, one of the greatest paradoxes that ever happened, outside of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. When the enemy... He had routed them, and the different armies was in the mountains. He had them routed, and the sun was going down. Oh, my, what a time it was for General Joshua! [Joshua 10:9-14]\n\nL-107 Remember, he fought that land through, without having a hospital, a nurse, a first-aid band, or a wounded man. Tell me something that can beat that. Yes, sir. He never had no hospitals, no nurses, and he never lost any man, as long as they walked in the will and Word of the Lord. God proved that He was with them. That's right. Notice now.\n\nL-108 And we find out that Joshua knew, if night come, they'd slip around and get with one another, and--and get theirself together and make another big army, and he'd have a rough time with them the next day. He didn't know what to do, so he looked up to God. He needed help, and he needed that sun to stand still. So he just commanded that sun to 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min stand still, and the... said for \"the moon to hang over Ajalon,\" not move until he commanded it. And the moon and sun stayed still for twenty-four hours, when Joshua fought the battle and conquered the enemy, because he was right in the line of duty. He had a right to do it, because he was obeying God's commandment. [Joshua 10:12-14]\n\nL-109 And as long as you are in the line of duty, keeping God's Word, doing just what He told you to do, marching by the orders of God, you've got a right to say to that mountain, \"Be moved!\" [Matthew 17:20], [Mark 11:23-24], [Matthew 21:21-22]\n\nL-110 God keeps His Word. \"If you say to this mountain, 'Be moved,' don't doubt in your heart, but believe that that what you said will come to pass, you can have that what you have said.\" Jesus said that, in Saint Mark 11:22. That's the Truth. I know that's the Truth. It's God's Word, and that proves that it's the Truth. We're just afraid sometimes. We get to a place, we're afraid He won't keep that Word. He will keep that Word. He said He would do it. Now, we find that's true. He proved it. [Matthew 21:21-22], [Mark 11:23-24]\n\nL-111 Isaiah's prophecy, one time, which something that had never happened; never did before, and never has since. He said, \"A virgin shall conceive.\" Could you imagine a woman, without knowing a man, would have a child? Isaiah said, \"A virgin shall conceive.\" [Isaiah 7:14]\n\nL-112 And God caused a virgin to conceive, to prove His Word truth. He proved His Word, 'cause a virgin did conceive and she brought forth the Son. [Isaiah 7:14], [Matthew 1:18-23], [Luke 1:27-38]\n\nL-113 Now, that Word made flesh, look what It did. When that Son came forth, He was the Word Himself. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\" [John 1:1, 14]\n\nL-114 He was that living Word. He proved He was that living Word. He said to those teachers of that day, \"Who can condemn me of sin?\" Sin is \"unbelief.\" \"Who can tell Me that I'm an unbeliever? Every Word that's written of Me, has been fulfilled.\" The last seven predictions of His life was fulfilled in the last seven hours, on the cross. Everything was written of Him, was fulfilled, because He was the Word. He proved He were, was. He healed the sick. He raised the dead. He conquered death, hell, and the grave. He proved He was the Word.\n\nL-115 Notice this case here at Jairus' house. He was... He had told them the truth. We see Him as He crossed the sea. He comes in. [Luke 8:41-42], [Mark 5:22-24]\n\nL-116 There was a little woman up on the hill, that had spent all of her money with the physicians. No doubt, the physicians had done all they knowed how to do, to get the woman well; probably Hebrew physicians, and that was a Hebrew woman, so they had done all they could for their sister. Although, they had nothing to stop this blood issue, which was, perhaps, a menopause time and her blood had flowed forth till she... little thing was so weak she could hardly get around any more. And she had heard about Jesus. And when she seen the little boat push into the willows, she went down to find out. [Luke 8:43-48], [Mark 5:25-34]\n\nL-117 A lot of His critics was standing there. And He is not free of critics today. If they'd have knowed Who He was, they would not have been His critics. But they was His critics because they didn't know Who He was.\n\nL-118 And that's the way with the Message today, so many good men and women criticize This because they don't know what It is.\n\nL-119 Jesus said, \"If you'd have knowed Moses, you'd have knowed Me. Moses spoke of Me. Many great man longed to see this day. If I do not the works of My Father, then believe Me not. I have greater witness,\" He said, \"than that of John, for the works that I do, prove that the Father is with Me.\" He had greater works, because He was the Identified. John was identified also, as the voice of one crying in the wilderness. But when He come, He was the prophet that Moses had spoke of would be raised up. [John 5:46]\n\nL-120 As I said the other night, He come in three names; the name of the Son of God, Son of man, and Son of David. [John 1:34], [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-121 When He was on earth here, the first time, He was the Son of man. He could not be Son of God then; He never 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min claimed to be. He said He was \"Son of man.\" When anybody would question Him, He said, \"You see the Son of man; the Son of man.\" Now, \"Son of man\" is a prophet. He had to come that way, because, the Scripture, He cannot come contrary to the Scripture. [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-122 That's why, today, that our--our Message of this hour cannot come through theologians and theology, it's got to come back to the same thing it promised to do. It must be that way.\n\nL-123 So we find that, in this Man, He had to be a prophet. Not Son of God there, He had to be Son of man. Jehovah Himself called the prophets, Jeremiah and them, \"Son of man.\" \"When you see the Son of man...\" \"Who is the Son of man?\" they kept asking. [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-124 Then, He served His office as Son of man. Then He served His office now as Son of God. God is a Spirit, and when now He served through the Church Ages, as Son of God. Now, in the Millennium, He'll be Son of David, when He sits on the throne of David. He'll be heir to the throne, Son of David. Son of man, Son of God, Son of David, and it's the same Man all the time. [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-125 Just like Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; the office of God. He was God the Father, then He became God the Son, now He is God the Holy Ghost. Not three Gods; one God, three manifestation, three attributes of the same God.\n\nL-126 Now we find, and in this hour that we're now living, God keeps His Word just the same as He did then.\n\nL-127 We find out that He come across the sea. This woman believed Him, there was something within her begin to pound. She had no Scripture for it, no more Scripture than Joshua had to stop the sun, but she believed in her heart that He was the Son of God. So she said, \"If I can only touch His garment, I will be healed.\" So she pressed through the crowd until she touched His garment, and the blood issue stopped. [Matthew 9:21]\n\nL-128 Now, He looked upon the audience, to find out who touched Him. No doubt, there was someone. He stopped. All the people thronging Him; and some making fun of Him, some laughing at Him; the priest standing off and questioning Him, and the clergymen, and so forth. But there was some who believed Him. And, and after a while He stopped, all of a sudden, turned around, said, \"Who touched Me?\" [Luke 8:43-47]\n\nL-129 Some of them said, \"Why, Master!\" I believe it was Peter said, \"Why, the whole crowd is thronging You. Why, who 'touched' You? Why, everybody is touching You!\" [Luke 8:45]\n\nL-130 He said, \"But I perceive that virtue has gone from Me.\" He got weak. It was a different kind of touch. [Luke 8:46]\n\nL-131 If we could only see that, brother, sister! If you can touch Him with that certain touch! Oh, sick people, I'm fixing to pray for you, just in a few minutes. I do believe that I have the Holy Spirit, no more Holy Spirit than what you've got right out there, these men has got here. The same Holy Spirit, but it's a commandment of God; and if you'll believe that to be the commandment of God, of praying for the sick, and laying hands on them, and casting out evil spirits, and the promises that He has made, it'll be the same thing with you. You'll get what you ask for, if you can believe it. \"Canst thou believe that I'm able to do this?\" said Jesus. [Mark 5:27-28]\n\nL-132 \"Yeah, Lord, I believe,\" said the man with the child with the epilepsy, \"I believe that Thou art the Son of God that was to come into the world.\" Now, we know that that can only take that attitude to bring the results. [Mark 9:17-24]\n\nL-133 Now, quickly, let's think of Him a moment, here He is on His road up. A little priest came down, no doubt but that little fellow was a borderline believer.\n\nL-134 There is so many of them in the world today, little borderline believers. They want to believe That. They want to believe that the Holy Ghost is real. They want to believe this is the apostolic move, as God promised in the last days He would pour out His Spirit. We... he wants to believe in Malachi 4, that He promised, in the last days the--the original pentecostal Faith would be restored back to the--to the church again. [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-135 Malachi 4 claims it. \"Behold, I will send to you Elijah in the last day,\" that's right, \"and He will restore the Faith of the children back to the fathers again,\" see, \"the Faith of the fathers to the children, also.\" See, it's got to be. You say, \"Well, that was John the Baptist.\" No, no. [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-136 John the Baptist was Malachi 3. That's right. Matthew 11 says so, \"If you can receive it, this is he who is spoke of, 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min 'Behold, I send My messenger before My face.'\" It was Elijah, certainly. Jesus said it was. But not the Elijah of Malachi 4, at all. [Malachi 3:1], [Matthew 11:9-11], [Mark 1:2-3], [Luke 7:26-28]\n\nL-137 Because, \"Immediately after that Message, the earth is to be burnt with fire, and the righteous walk out upon the ashes of the wicked.\" So it never happened in the time of John. We've got to have a Message sweep back and bring the people out of all these denominational conditions, back to the original, genuine pentecostal Faith. And we're seeing it done, it's fulfilling of a Scripture that has to come to pass. All Scriptures must be fulfilled. How many more of that we could apply, it would take me longer than my time up now, to show. But you understand these things, that it's got to happen just exactly like this, to Abraham's children, just as He promised. [Malachi 4:2-3, 5-6]\n\nL-138 We see Jesus going up now to heal the little girl. Cause, the father, the little borderline believer, something come to a spot that he had to recognize Jesus, so, the doctor had given her up. And he got on his little black hat and took off down to find out whether he could find Jesus. See, He is always right there when you want Him. He found Him just coming into the shore. [Luke 8:41]\n\nL-139 And he said, \"Come to my little girl, lay Your hands upon her, and she will be made well.\" Said, \"She is laying at the point of death. She is my only child.\" Said, \"She is twelve years of age. We don't have no other children. Wife and I,\" perhaps, \"are getting old. And this is the only child that we have, and she is laying at the point of death. Lord, I believe You. If You'll just come lay Your hands upon her, she'll get well.\" [Luke 8:41-42] See, what did he recognize? He recognized that that promised Word of God was manifested in this Man.\n\nL-140 Just the same as Nicodemus said, \"Rabbi, teacher, we know Thou art a teacher comes from God. We know it. The Pharisees know it.\" Why didn't they confess it? \"No man could do the things that You do, 'less God was with Him. We know that You come from God.\" [John 3:2]\n\nL-141 Here we find out that Jairus believed the same thing. He said, \"Come lay Your hand.\" He knowed that God was in Him. \"Lay Your hands upon my child. Though she is at the point of death, she'll live.\" [Luke 8:41-42], [Mark 5:23]\n\nL-142 He just walked along with him. And while he was going, here come a runner coming back, and said, \"Don't trouble Him, don't trouble the Master any farther. The--the girl, dead, she's gone on now. She's passed on.\" [Luke 8:49]\n\nL-143 Jesus turned to Jairus, said, \"Didn't I say to you, 'If you would only believe, you'll see the glory of God'? If you'll just only believe it!\" [Luke 8:50]\n\nL-144 He got into the room, and there they was, all lamenting and crying, and wailing, just like any persons would do. A fine little girl, a pastor's daughter, had died, and she was taken out of this world. And she probably been dead for hours, and then they had laid her out on the couch, and was ready to embalm her body, perhaps, and put her away, and in burial. Then we find that Jesus walked in the house. They was all wailing. He says, \"Give peace.\" He said, \"She is not dead, but she is asleep.\" [Luke 8:52]\n\nL-145 Now could you imagine what they thought? \"Why, this man we know, now. We understand that He's an illegitimate child. And we hear of His, all of His rashel predictions that He makes. And now we know that the priest is right, 'the man is crazy,' for we know that she is dead. The doctor pronounced her 'dead,' and there she lays. She is gone, and we know she is dead.\" They said, they laughed Him to scorn, in other words, made Him feel embarrassed, by criticizing Him. [Luke 8:52-53], [Mark 5:38-40]\n\nL-146 But He had done said that she wasn't dead. That's all it takes. \"She is asleep.\" No matter how much critics, He's going to prove His Word! He put them all out of the house, get all the unbelievers away. Took Peter, James, and John, the believers, three witnesses, and the father and mother, went in and took the daughter by the hand, and spoke in a language that called her soul back from somewhere out yonder in Eternity. And the girl lived. [Luke 8:51, 54-56], [Mark 5:37, 40-42]\n\nL-147 What did He do? He proved His Word. He proved that what He said. She was not dead. She was asleep. Now we find out, doing this, realizing, and He proved something else there. Now He proved that He was God. He proved that He had foreknowledge. Watch what His Word said now. \"She is not dead, but she is asleep.\" See, she wasn't dead, to 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min begin with. She was asleep. Showed His foreknowledge. Now, there might have been a many of little maiden died that same morning, but this one wasn't dead. She was asleep, like Lazarus was. And He called her out of that sleep, because she wasn't dead. [Luke 8:52-56], [Mark 5:39-43], [John 11:11, 43-44]\n\nL-148 \"And he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me, shall never die.\" Only those who are on the Lamb's Book of Life, that He redeemed when He died, that's who He'll call out of that sleep, at that day, those who are quickened by His power, that has that quickening power laying in them. Even as I said last night; even after Elisha had died, and his bones was laying in the grave, that quickening power was still on his bones. [John 11:25-26]\n\nL-149 Sure, He proved that Who He was. Now we find out again, likewise, He proved also, that, in Hebrews the 4th chapter and the 12th verse, He proved He was the Word of God. He certainly did. Notice what He did. Hebrews, 12, Hebrews 4:12 says that, \"The Word of God is more powerful, quicker than a two-edged sword, and--and It also is a Discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart.\" Watch just a moment now. [Hebrews 4:12]\n\nL-150 When He first started His ministry, after He come out to show that He was the Word, when He come out of the wilderness from His temptation, there was a man named Peter, his name then was Simon. And he came to Jesus with his brother, Andrew. And as soon as he walked up into the Presence of Jesus Christ, Jesus said, \"Your name is Simon. And your father's was Jonas. From henceforth you shall be called Peter.\" That proved that He was the Word, because the Word is a Discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. He was the Word. [John 1:42]\n\nL-151 Philip seen this happening. He took off around the mountain, was gone a day, and come back. And he brought with him a friend named Nathanael. And he said, \"These things are really happening. Moses said 'the Lord our God shall raise up a Prophet' like him, and here the Man is. Why, He told Simon who he was, even who his father was, and we know that what He says is the truth. Because, God said it in the Word, and here it is proved that He was to do that, and that proves that that is the Messiah.\" [John 1:40-48]\n\nL-152 And when he walked up in His Presence, Jesus said to him, said, \"Behold an Israelite, in whom there is no guile.\" [John 1:47-48] He said, \"Rabbi, when did You know me?\"\n\nL-153 Said, \"Before Philip called you, when you were under the tree, I saw you.\" He proved His Word. He proved God's Word. He did. [John 1:48]\n\nL-154 The woman at the well, when she had... Well, He asked her to let Him have a drink of water from the pitcher that she was drawing water from the well, and she said, \"It's not customary for you Jews to ask we Samaritan women such a thing as that, because we have no dealing.\" [John 4:9]\n\nL-155 He said, \"But if you knew Who you were speaking with, you would ask Me for a drink.\" She said, \"The well is deep.\" [John 4:10-11]\n\nL-156 And the conversation, as it moved on, finally He found out what her trouble was. And He said, \"Go get your husband, and come here.\" She said, \"I don't have any husband.\" [John 4:16-17]\n\nL-157 He said, \"Thou has said truth, for you've had five, and the one you're living with now is not your husband.\" [John 4:18]\n\nL-158 \"Why,\" she said, \"sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.\" She...\"We hadn't had one for four hundred years, you know.\" Said, \"I perceive that You are a prophet. Now, we know that when the Messiah cometh, which is called the Christ, when He comes, He will tell us these kind of things. That will be His sign.\" [John 4:19]\n\nL-159 When He said, \"I am He that speaks with you,\" He proved His Word. He... we prove what He claimed to be. He was the Messiah, the Son of God. [John 4:21-24, 25]\n\nL-160 Now we find out, also, that this little woman that had this blood issue, that touched His garment, that also proved to her that He was the Word of God. [Luke 8:43-48] 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min\n\nL-161 Now remember, tonight, Jesus said... Also, in Hebrews, 1, Hebrews the 3rd chapter, I believe it is, He said that, \"He now is a High Priest,\" this age we're living in now, \"a High Priest sitting in the Majesty of God, in the Heavens, that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity.\" [Hebrews 4:15]\n\nL-162 Hebrews 13:8 said, \"He's the same, yesterday, today, and forever.\" He's the same God that He was then. He's the same tonight. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-163 Saint John 14:12, He said, \"He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also. Even more than this shall he do, for I go to My Father.\" See? \"He that believeth on me, these works that I do shall he do also.\" [John 14:12]\n\nL-164 In Matthew 28, He said, \"A little while and the world won't see Me no more, yet ye shall see Me, for I will be with you even to the end of the world.\" [John 16:16-19]\n\nL-165 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He stands, tonight, to prove His Word. (My time is gone.) But He proved He could. He proved His Word then, what He had promised for that day. He proved Isaiah's words. He proved Noah's words. He proved Moses' words. He proved every one of the prophets' words. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-166 He promised that in this day, the day that we're living in, that the world would be in a Sodom condition, homosexuals. Just look at it in the world today, all over the world where I travel; not only here, everywhere. It's critical. In Sweden, young men and women go skiing, stark-naked. And they in Germany and in France, and everywhere else, it's just about kind of a riffraff that we have here in the United States. It's an age. I, if I get a chance to ever come back, I'd like to speak on some of the prophetic things, to you, and show you that, the age that we're living in. The Bible said that, \"Children would rule their parents.\" [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... Word.\n\nL-167 But, remember, Abraham had a seed, which was the seed Isaac. He had other seeds after Sarah's death. And he was a hundred and forty-five years old, he married another woman, had seven sons besides daughters, 'cause God had turned him back to a young man when he was a hundred years old. He was then again just forty-five, so then he... We know that. I've preached that to you here in California, years ago. [Galatians 3:16]\n\nL-168 And now we understand that Abraham's Seed was not the literal sexual seed through Sarah, which was Isaac, which made a nation, but the royal Seed was by the promise, which was Jesus Christ. And through that Seed, He raised up a royal Seed. Oh, my! Now we are a royal priesthood, a royal nation, a holy nation, offering praises to God, the sacrifice of our lips giving praise to His Name. God proved His Word, He poured out the Holy Ghost upon us. [Romans 9:7-8], [Romans 4:1-5, 13-22]\n\nL-169 He said, \"As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the day when the Son of man will being revealed.\" Now did you notice? From Son of God, just before He become Son of David, He reveals Himself again as Son of man. Did you notice the Scripture? [Luke 17:28]\n\nL-170 For, He always does, He never does nothing unless He makes it known to His servants the prophets. That's exactly. That's what His promise was. See? He never does nothing... God cannot lie. He always reveals it, first, before He does it. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-171 Look at the situation we're sitting in today. Look where we're at. Every one of you will admit we're in a modern Sodom. You know this country is in for it. They're beyond hopes. There is no salvation left for this nation or no other nation. We're beyond that now. The prophecies that's prophesied about this, is fulfilled. God is gleaning, getting that little sheep wherever it is. It'll all be in, one day. We're at the end time. Look, positionally.\n\nL-172 I ask you, just as a brother or sister, to build just a moment more of faith before we pray for these people. And I know we don't have to go at no certain time. But I--I--I want to start the prayer line, then you that have to go may go then. See? You that want to stay in the prayer line may stay. But just let me, just as a brother, just point out something to you a moment.\n\nL-173 Watch Jesus, in Luke 17:30, see, when He was saying there about the end time, how they would be like in days of Noah. Then He said, \"And like, likewise, in the days of Sodom,\" said, \"when the Son of man is being revealed.\" The 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min Son of man again, not Son of God. \"Son of man,\" see, that brings in Malachi 4 again, right straight back. All these other prophecies coming right in, how it's supposed to be done. He proves His Word to be so. That's right. [Luke 17:30], [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-174 And notice, in doing so, how He is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, and what's going to take place, how the restoration will come back. \"And your sons and daughters shall prophesy. Upon My handsmaids and maidservants will I pour out of My Spirit. And I'll show signs in the heavens above.\" [Acts 2:17-20], [Joel 2:28-31]\n\nL-175 I got a picture here, of Brother Lee Vayle's here. I'd like to show you just what taken place up on the mountain, the other day, when all the school kids turned out, just before this great subject of the open, them Seven Seals. When the school kids turned out, when I was up in there praying, here was Fire just in a funnel coming down, then go back up and burst out, and turn around and come back down again. That's what He said what to go tell the people. We... There It is, where the schools of Tucson... and where It went up into the air.\n\nL-176 And science took the pictures, and so forth, and questioned about It. They said, \"Where is It at? What happened?\" They can't make it out, see. Oh, it's not done in a corner, only darkened conscience. It never... Jesus, when He was here, there was millions of people never knew He was on earth. Yeah. There will be millions today won't understand, tens of millions of them.\n\nL-177 But there will be, to those Who It's sent to, they will understand. \"The wise shall know their God in that day, and they'll do exploits.\" We realize that, the hour that we're now living.\n\nL-178 Look at Sodom now, look what happened. He said, \"As it was in the days of Sodom.\" There was a group of people that was looking for a promised son. We believe that. That was Abraham and his group. There was a lukewarm bunch, Lot, half backslid, yet a believer; down in Sodom. Three classes of people. [Luke 17:28-30]\n\nL-179 There is always them three classes. Ham, Shem, Japheth's people. Also, believers, make-believers, and unbelievers. They're everywhere, and we--we find them in every group. And, everywhere, you find them. And that groups is still here. You have to divide that. You can take it right through the Scripture, just dovetails itself right in. [Genesis 9:18-27]\n\nL-180 Listen to this. Look at where we're sitting, positionally and prophetically, tonight. Now, every one of us know that the world is in a Sodomite condition.\n\nL-181 We know all the prophecies of Israel, is in its homeland. If you want to know nationally where we are standing, watch Israel, where it's at.\n\nL-182 If you want to know what condition the church is, watch the way women act. She's the church. See her, immoral, indecent; watch, look where the church is at. Just watch it, see, see, just watch women. You see where, how your women degrade and become so polluted, that's the way your church is, see, the type.\n\nL-183 Watch where Israel is, you see the time figure where we're at. See, just watch those signs and wonders. If you--if you, or if your eyes is open, see where we're at.\n\nL-184 Now watch positionally where we're setting, the world in a Sodom condition. Now notice, \"as it was.\" Now notice, there was somebody, in that day, watching for a coming promised son. Abraham and Sarah, they were watching for a promised son in Abraham's group. They was not in Sodom. But just at the moment, the last chapter of the event, just before the promised son came, there were three man came down from Heaven, an Angel... two Angels and God. And they came down and talked with Abraham, under the oak. Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen!\"--Ed.] And two of them went down into Sodom and cried out against the sins of the city. And it was just before the burning of the Gentile world, at that time. All Sodom perished right then. Just a few was pulled out, Lot and his two daughters. His wife never even made it; she turned back. How I could just like to have time to show you that right now, where that church is standing at that position. I want you to notice now. [Genesis 19:1], [Genesis 17:1, 15-17], [Genesis 18:1-2, 9-15, 20-22], [Genesis 19:1, 12-13, 15-29]\n\nL-185 And one Man stayed behind, that talked to Abraham, and he done a sign to Abraham. And, watch, Abraham had seen God in many great signs. We believe that, don't we? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Just before the coming 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min son. But before the son was manifested, there was a sign he was given. [Genesis 18:17-18]\n\nL-186 Because, the Son, the true Son, was to be the Son of God, through Abraham's faith, see, was Jesus. We being Abraham's seed, dead in Christ, we are Abraham's seed.\n\nL-187 Notice now just before that taken place, this son to come. Now, this One that stayed and talked to Abraham, had His back turned to the tent, and He said, \"Abraham.\" Now, just a day before that, he was Abram. Now He said, \"Abraham, where is thy wife, Sarah?\" not Sarra, S-a-r-r-a. S-a-r-a-h, princess. \"Where is thy wife, Sarah?\" Said, \"She is in the tent behind You.\" [Genesis 18:9]\n\nL-188 He said, \"I'm going to visit you, see, according to My promise that I made you.\" In other words, \"The time of life, Sarah will start in her ordinary time of life again.\" [Genesis 18:10]\n\nL-189 And Sarah, being old, a hundred years old now, in the tent, laughed up her sleeve. See, she smiled to herself, said, \"How could that Man be right? See, me an old woman, my lord Abraham out there, also old, family affair had been done away with for years.\" Said, \"How can I ever have pleasure again with my lord? He being old, and me old, past bearing, milk veins gone, every... 'She is dried up.' How could we ever have pleasure again?\" [Genesis 18:10-13]\n\nL-190 And that Man, with His back turned to the tent, said, \"Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'How can these things be?'\" What was that? Discernment, a prophetic! See? See? That's what he seen. [Genesis 18:12-15]\n\nL-191 Now He said, \"That will return again, and the Son of man,\" which that was, that was the Son of man right there. Well, he called Him Elohim, \"Lord God.\" Elohim, anybody knows that's right, Elohim is the Lord God. \"In the beginning Elohim created heavens and earth,\" the all-sufficient One. The Son of man made flesh, there He was standing there in flesh at that time, like a theophany, standing there discerning what Sarah was saying in the tent behind Him. He promised. Watch. The Royal Seed of Abraham is promised to see that same thing. [John 1:1-4], [Genesis 1:1]\n\nL-192 But notice Lot, he had a messenger down there, too, two of them went down there. One of them went down, and another one went down with him, and they preached and called the people to flee from the wrath that was to come. [Genesis 19:1]\n\nL-193 Positionally, the world has never sit in that estate, from that day that Jesus made the promise, until right now. I want to ask any historian that might be in the building, or if you hear even on this tape, and hear it at any time, please write me. I've studied history now for some thirty years, the Bible history, and there never has been a person that I've ever seen in all the history of the church, through the seven church ages. That we're now in Laodicea, and we know that.\n\nL-194 Never has there been a messenger, that ever went to the entire church, with his name ending with h-a-m, till now. G-r-a-h-a-m, Billy Graham. There has been Moody's, Finney, Sankey, Knox, Luther, and so forth, but never a h-a-m, \"father to nations.\" Now remember, he is G-r-a-h-am, six letters. But A-b-r-a-h-a-m is seven letters. Notice, they're down there, Billy Graham, going into the--the all parts of the world, and calling out of Sodom, \"Come out, flee the wrath that is to come.\" There is no man that I know of, in the field, that has got a hold of God, on that word of justification, like Billy Graham does. He can present it. He's not such a theologian... I guess he's a theologian, but he's not just a powerful teacher. But God is with him. That man will stand there with like a Sunday school lesson, hold those people spellbound. He's God's servant of the hour. To who? The church natural, that's in Sodom.\n\nL-195 But remember, there was one church spiritual, that wasn't in that denominational outfit, either. Called-out group, and they received a message, also, and a messenger. And what was it? Discerning the thoughts that was in the heart. God always proves His Word.\n\nL-196 Let's pray. Dear Heavenly Father, this crucial moment, where decisions must be made, time is ticking on by, we don't know what hour our Lord may come. And as we see these prophecies that's been made by Him, through Your prophets down through the ages, is now being unfolded. O God, how I thank You for this, that even able-bodied man, able man in--in theology, that can stand up against the wiles of the world and the unbelievers, and on these panels, and beyond a shadow of doubt stand there bold and gallant, knowing where they're standing and prove that Word to be true, by the Scriptures. And then we who are waiting on Your Coming, Lord, believing these other things that's been prophesied that would take place, to stand and enjoy seeing You walk right among us and perform the very thing that 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min You said would come to pass, proving Your Word to be right. Eternal God, Your sick children are sitting here.\n\nL-197 I don't know how much more time we've got to work. The evening sun is sinking. But You promised, to the prophet, \"It shall be Light about the evening time.\" And we see the same sun rises in the east, is the one that sets in the west. Civilization has traveled with the sun and now we're at the West Coast, and the Gospel traveled with civilization. Now, Father, we know this is the end of the Gospel, the end of time, the end of the age. She is fading into Eternity. But You promised that the Son would come out, the Son of man would be revealed. In the last day, this would take place. The evening Lights have come, Father. We thank Thee for that. And humbly as it is, yet You do it so simple, many times, that it goes way over the top of the great, so-called deep thinkers, and reveals it to babes such as will learn.\n\nL-198 I pray, God, that You'll make it so, tonight, that Your poor sick children here will see the promise of God, and each one of them will be healed, and go out of here, tomorrow, with new strong bodies, and be well again. Grant it, Lord, so that they can take the Message from one to the other, till that last one is in the fold, and then the doors will be shut. Help us, dear God. I ask You, tonight, in the face of all this, if You'll just once more, Father, for me.\n\nL-199 It--it seemed, the other night, the people never noticed it much. But, I pray, let it happen again tonight, Lord. Cause, I have went over my lotted time to speak, but I don't know how much longer we're going to have to do this. So, I pray, Father, will You hear me? And hear the prayer of these godly men and women that's sitting here tonight, who is filled with Your Spirit. They are believers, Lord, You can just work among them. And we're... I pray that You'll confirm Your Word that You said, \"He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also.\" Let it be again, Jesus, to prove that You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. I ask it for the glory of God, in the Name of His Son, Jesus Christ. Amen. [John 14:12]\n\nL-200 Now, just for a moment, I want to know how many people in here that have prayer cards. I--I want you to raise your hands, each one of you that has prayer cards. Well, it's generally, I guess, just about all over.\n\nL-201 I wonder how many people in here that does not have prayer cards, and yet you're sick, would you raise your hands and say, \"I do not have a prayer card, and yet I am sick. I am needy.\"\n\nL-202 I want to ask you to be reverent for a moment. Now, I love to talk to you. That's always my trouble, I talk too long. But before you come, I--I'd hope and trust that God will prove this and what I've said to be the Truth, and let--let Him just see.\n\nL-203 Now, how many sitting out there that's sick, that knows that I don't know one thing about you, raise up your hands. Just look at that. All right.\n\nL-204 I want you without the prayer cards now. The prayer cards will be called up. I want you to pray.\n\nL-205 The Bible said that, \"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" He says, \"He's a High Priest sitting there making intercessions upon our confession.\" We have to confess it first, before He can be a High Priest, 'cause He only intercedes to our confession. Is that right, minister brethren? [The ministers say, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] See, He only intercedes upon our confession, what we confess that He is, what He has done for us. Not what He will do. He has already done it. We have to confess that He's done it. \"He was wounded for our transgressions, with His stripes we were healed.\" [Hebrews 13:8], [Isaiah 53:5]\n\nL-206 Now, the Heavenly Father knows. And looking upon you, is to see I recognize a good friend of mine from Ohio, him and his wife sitting here, is Mr. Dauch and his wife. And I believe, sitting second or third from them, is again that Reverend, Mr. Blair that I seen last night. It's dark over the audience, to me, account of these lights here is kind of a little blarry to me, and I--I don't see you too well.\n\nL-207 But I want you to pray. And you put on your heart the thing that you have need of, and you ask our High Priest, Who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. [Hebrews 4:15]\n\nL-208 Now, me not knowing you, and you might just touch me all over, be like touching your brother, your husband, your pastor, someone, it wouldn't--it wouldn't do no good. But if you touch Him, and if we are truly in line with His Spirit, then He can use your faith to touch Him, and by a gift to speak back through. 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min\n\nL-209 See, I'd be just as mute as this, this is here, without a voice speaking through it. There has got to... This, this is a mute without something here to speak through it. And so is any person, is a mute, when it comes to these things, unless God speaks through them.\n\nL-210 Now you pray, and let's see if these things that I have said is the truth. God help it to be so. I don't say that He will. I hope that He will. I'm trusting that He will. He has never let me down yet, over the years, across and around the world, with all kinds of nations, and millions of people. He has never failed me yet. And I'm sure, just as sure as I believe I'm standing here, He won't fail me now.\n\nL-211 I'm going to ask you just to be reverent and keep seated, just for a few moments. We're going to dismiss the main audience and pray for the sick, just in a moment.\n\nL-212 But I want you, you believers, that if you'll just not look to me, but believe. Say, \"I believe that what the man said is the Scripture. I don't know as we're as far up in the time as he says we are. But, if it is, then it's got to happen. If his Words are God's Words, then, his words will fail but God's Words won't.\"\n\nL-213 God is obligated to back up His Word. He'll prove It. He'll prove It. \"He that believeth on Me.\" He proved that this is the last day. He proved what would happen. He proved that this was supposed to happen. [John 5:24], [John 6:35]\n\nL-214 And, remember, Abraham and his group never received one more sign from God, until the promised son arrived. How many knows that's true? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] That sign of discernment! And the royal Seed of Abraham, let me hear you... Let me tell you. THUS SAITH THE LORD, you're receiving your last sign. That's according to the Scriptures and the revelation of God that's in my heart, that speaks that this is the Truth. And I trust that you will believe it to be the Truth. [Genesis 18:9-15]\n\nL-215 Now you believe. Everybody just believe, say, \"Lord Jesus, let me touch You. I have a need in my heart, and I know Brother Branham knows nothing about me. I don't even know the man, he don't know me, but You know. And if he has told me the Truth, this will happen.\" I ask you, don't move now, just for a little bit. Be real...\n\nL-216 See, you're spirit. And I take every spirit in here under my control, in the Name of Jesus Christ, that His Word might be fulfilled.\n\nL-217 Now just be reverent. Pray. Look to Him, say, \"Lord, I believe it. Help Thou my unbelief.\"\n\nL-218 Let's start. I have to concentrate on some sort of the part of the building here, 'cause, see, so many of you, and each one of you is a spirit.\n\nL-219 I cannot. You say, \"What about me?\" I could not tell you. It's sovereign. All the works of God is sovereign. There will be many people healed crossing this platform, tonight, there will probably be many not. It's all in the sovereign of God. Who can tell Him what to do? No one. He works according to His Own will, His Own plan.\n\nL-220 But you just believe. Be humble. Don't be nervous. Just reach out for God, and say, \"Lord God, I believe it.\" See? \"Let me touch Your garment. I have need of such-and-such. I know the brother don't know me or know my need, but he told us about these things that You did, and say that You're here the same today.\"\n\nL-221 That don't exclude you brethren here on the platform, any of you. I just ask you, my brethren, as fellow workers of the--of the Gospel of Christ. I speak to you just as sincerely as I know, as a--a dying man with you, see, leaving this world. We've got to leave. And I must give an account at the Day of Judgment, for what I say. I'm conscious of that, very conscious. And I appreciate you man, what you are, standing here with me, helping me. I'm trying to help you, to do everything I can, for the Kingdom-of-God's sake. I'm praying and asking.\n\nL-222 Here, how many ever seen that Light in the picture? You seen the picture of It? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] There It hangs right there. Can't you see It?\n\nL-223 It's up over that lady sitting there with her handkerchief. She is praying for a loved one. That's right, lady. [The lady says, \"That's right, Brother Branham.\"--Ed.] That loved one... Do you believe me to be His prophet, or pardon me, His servant? [\"I sure do.\"] You believe that? All right. Now, if God can reveal to me what's wrong, why, you will 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min accept it to be from God, just as the woman that touched His garment? Now, you know you're--you're twenty or thirty feet from me, or more, you never touched me. But you've touched Something, that you know you're in contact with Something, Someone. What it is, it's for a woman, which is your daughter. That's right. Do you believe that she'll be made well? She is a dope addict. [\"That's right.\"] That's exactly right. [\"That's right, brother.\"] I see her swimming, drunk. See? Now, the handkerchief that you have in your hand, you place upon her, and don't doubt. I believe that God will deliver her. Will you believe it with me? Amen. [\"Oh! Thank You, Jesus!\"]\n\nL-224 Now, I don't know the woman, but God knows her. Do you believe now with all your heart?\n\nL-225 The man sitting up there with the striped shirt on, with a hernia, you believe that God would heal you and make you well? Do you believe that He'll do it? I've never seen the man in my life. You have a prayer card, sir? [The man says, \"No, I don't.\"--Ed.] You don't have? You don't need one. \"If thou canst believe!\"\n\nL-226 Here sits a woman trying to look over the top of this woman sitting right here. She is a stranger to me. But she is real nervous. I don't know her. I've never seen her, in my life. But God knows her, and she realizes right now she is in contact with Something. You've been praying there for some cause. The reason that you are, you can't stay no longer than tonight. You must leave the meeting. You're planning on going to your home, tomorrow. You're not from here, or neither are you from California. You're going east from here. You're going by air. You're planning, going by air. You're from Oklahoma. Yeah. That's right.\n\nL-227 You are also in a dying condition. You come here to be prayed for. You do not have a prayer card. But you believed that you're going to be healed, if you could only get here. That's right. Also, your condition is cancer. The cancer is in the bone. Do you believe you're going to be healed now? You believe you're in contact with Him, my sister? Perhaps God will tell me who you are, then would that help you? If it is, raise up your hand if you believe that, that (God) it would help you. Alright, Mrs. Steel, you can return to Oklahoma. I don't know the lady. I have never seen her.\n\nL-228 Here is a lady sitting right back here behind her. She is suffering with varicose veins. And she has also got a son that's an alcoholic, and she is praying for him. If she'll believe, she can be healed. Mrs. Mason, will you believe with all your heart, and believe that Jesus Christ will grant the healing to you? You do?\n\nL-229 All right, then lay your hand on that lady sitting next to you there, she is praying for her husband that's unsaved. God will grant the healing. Let us pray.\n\nL-230 Dear God, I pray that You'll grant that blessing to her. Give that woman the desire of her heart, Lord. Her faith is so close to You, it's touched You. And I pray, Father, that You'll help, in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-231 Now believe with all your heart, that you receive it. Will you do that? All right. God bless you.\n\nL-232 Do you believe your husband is going to be saved, lady? Do you believe with all your heart? Raise up your hand, you do.\n\nL-233 There seems to be, before me, a woman that's very heavy. There she sits. You believe me to be God's servant? You believe me to be God's servant? You do? All right. I do not know you. What your trouble is, is glands. You're overweight. You've been to a doctor, he said he could do nothing about it, but that was an earthly doctor. See? Your... You just had a lot of sorrow. You've lost your husband. You're not from here. You're really from Arkansas. You're seeking work, also, and you can't find work. You was afraid that, something, you wouldn't get called. But your faith now has touched God. My sister, you go, believe. God give you a job, give you the desire of your heart.\n\nL-234 God proves His Word to be true. Do you believe that to be so? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now I just want you to pray with me again.\n\nL-235 Father, God, You are the same God that proved. When You said, \"The girl is not dead, she is asleep,\" then You had to prove it. Now, You promised, that just before the coming of the end time, that the Son of man would reveal 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min Himself in the same manner He did at Sodom. You promised it, Lord. Now You've come to the earth, in the form of the Holy Spirit, and got among us, tonight, we believing people, and have proved it. You have proved Your Word like You did that day. Lord, we need no more proof. You're among us. We love You. And we realize that this is the last sign just before Your Coming, according to the Scriptures. And all the shadows and types never fail. They have got to be positive.\n\nL-236 So we pray, Father, as Your children come now to be prayed for, that every one will be healed. May there not be a sick person left among us, at the end of this healing service. O dear God, will You let Your anointing be so graciously upon Your people just now, that every one of them may be healed?\n\nL-237 And if there be some here, who is not Your children yet, and upon the basis of these things, that... They have heard the Word and seen the thing done, just exactly proved to the very letter, and Who You are and what You are, that You're here.\n\nL-238 And, Lord, would You--would You bless a lie? Why, certainly not, Lord. But You did promise to bless Your Word, and It would not return void. It would accomplish that which It was purposed for. And now You have did that before us, tonight, beyond any shadow of doubt.\n\nL-239 And with our heads bowed, is there people here that never have believed before, that would like to just raise up your hand? With your head bowed, just raise up your hand. And stand to your feet, and say, \"I now believe, with all my heart. And I want to accept Jesus Christ, right now.\" Would you do that, any people, any people that's here, that hasn't yet accepted Christ, and would want to do it at this time? I won't tell you... You go to the church of your choice. But I'm asking you to receive Jesus Christ while you... You'll probably never be no closer to Him until you see Him in person when He comes in His visible body from the Heavens. Will you now accept Him if you haven't already done it?\n\nL-240 Upon basis of seeing no one here standing, I believe then all of you to be sane, sensible people, and realizing what you're doing. If you're sitting there under this, you remember, \"If you're ashamed of Me before man, I'll be ashamed of you before My Father.\" There was somebody standing up, maybe, yes, in the audience, in the back. [Mark 8:38], [Luke 9:26]\n\nL-241 Dear God, those may, I not see, that's standing, they want to accept You. They realize, Lord, that this has not been done until this time, and now You confirm it and prove that it's so. I pray, Father, that in their hearts, that's strangely moved at this time... How do we know but what this is the last person to come in? This may be the end for Los Angeles. This may be the last soul that'll be born into the Kingdom. We don't know when that times comes. And when it does, the door will be closed, the Body will be complete. It will not be a freak Body or a freak Bride. It'll just have so many members whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world, to which Jesus came to take, like Adam, walk right out to save his wife. I pray, God, that You'll receive them now into Your Kingdom. They're in Your hands. Deal with them, Lord, I pray in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-242 God bless each one of you that stood. I didn't know some of you were standing. Some stood in the back, some up in the balcony. Now I want you to do one thing for me. Please understand me. Meet some minister here and talk it over with them, after the church is over. Will you do that? Don't let it fail. If you've never been baptized in Christian baptism, do that next, and then stay with your hands up until you receive the Holy Ghost.\n\nL-243 Now, and many people has prayer cards here. We're going to ask them to stand, and come up here, and I guess walk across. Or shall I have to come... [A man says, \"No.\"--Ed.] I'll not be able to. [\"Come from this side over here.\"] From this side over here, can come out through this way, over on this side, the people who have prayer cards.\n\nL-244 And now if there is any of you that must go, it's... I'm late. I'm sorry. I'll try to do a little better tomorrow night. At... it's ten minutes after ten, by the clock on the wall. Thank you very much for your attendance tonight, and may the God of Heaven bless you. If you'd like to stay and watch the prayer line, you're always welcome. But we're going to start praying for the sick now, and I don't want to hold you unless you want to stay. You're dismissed in the Name of the Lord Jesus. May God's peace go with you and bless you, and give you rest in your bodies, through the night, and grant you good health so you can come back again tomorrow night. God be with you now. 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min\n\nL-245 And let those who have prayer cards stand for prayer now, as universally we pray for the people. Now we want you to know, now, you that's standing with a prayer card, is there any doubt in your life? Is there any, pardon me, any sin in your life that you haven't confessed? If there is, let me ask you this. Don't come into the prayer line with unconfessed sin in your heart. Cause, you must... This is the children's bread, see. And if you're not a Christian, surrender your life to Christ, in the prayer line, then come. It's for the believer. Will you do it? Accept Him first as your Saviour, and then come across the platform, to be prayed for.\n\nL-246 Now I'm going to pray for each individual; not just pass them by, like some kind of a routine. We're in a church now. I think Sister Wyatt has give us the reason that we can stay and pray. [A man says, \"Yes, all night, as long as you want.\"--Ed.] We can stay as long as we want to. And I thank Sister Wyatt and the staff here, for letting us do that. God bless her. Her gallant husband stood on this platform, prayed for sick, until he died, as far as I know, a real soldier of the cross. And now I'm trying to keep on doing the same thing, bless this people.\n\nL-247 And now I pray that each one of you comes past here... You don't have to confess anything that you want to. You don't have to say anything wrong with you. Just come and let me pray for you, and believe.\n\nL-248 Do you believe that God has sent me to do this? Raise up your hand. Remember what the Angel of the Lord said? \"If you get the people to believe you, be sincere when you pray, nothing shall stand before the prayer.\" And you know that's true. It's been proved, over and over.\n\nL-249 Now I'm going to ask that our Sister Rose, if she will, to play that, Only Believe, or, The Great Physician Now Is Near, or something.\n\nL-250 I want each one of you now in--in fellowship with me. Will you, also, you people that is not in the prayer line, will you be praying for these people? Well, promise them that, by raising up your hand, \"I'll be praying, see. We'll all be praying.\" All right. Yeah.\n\nL-251 I would that you would, if you have to leave, go real quietly now, so that they won't bother while we pray.\n\nL-252 Do you believe it will be over now, sister? [The sister says, \"With all my heart.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-253 Dear God, I lay my hands upon sister, challenge the affliction of her body. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may it leave her. Amen. Bless you, sister.\n\nL-254 You believe with all your heart? All your sins are confessed? You're, as far as you know, you're ready to receive your healing?\n\nL-255 Dear God, I lay my hands upon my sister, in the Name of Your Son, Jesus Christ, and ask that the affliction of her body will be gone, in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-256 All sins are confessed, and you're ready for your healing? You believe, brother? [The brother says, \"I believe with all my heart.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-257 Dear God, I lay my hands upon my brother, as we know that You're present here, Lord. I pray that You'll heal him, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nL-258 All sins confessed? No, you don't hear. [Brother Branham speaks slow and distinct because of the sister's deafness--Ed.] You believe that you will hear? [The sister says, \"I believe. But I've been deaf.\"] You believe. The woman is deaf now. We go pray here.\n\nL-259 Dear God, I pray that You will heal our sister, and take this deafness from her. She is sitting in a closed-off world, where she cannot hear. I pray that You'll grant her healing, through Jesus' Name.\n\nL-260 I'm going to ask the people to keep your head bowed, a minute. I want to see what's happened to her. Now, please, in Jesus Christ's Name, let no one raise their head or eyes. Now, you mustn't do that till I tell you to.\n\nL-261 Can you hear me now? [She says, \"Some, distorted.\" Brother Branham claps his hands once. \"I can hear you.\"--Ed.] Hear me? [\"Some.\"] Can hear? She can hear now. [Brother Branham claps once more.] See? Hear that, 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min some?\n\nL-262 Now you believe with all your heart. You will? And you believe, and God will make you completely well. She said. I just prayed and put my hands on her ears, and she said she could hear something. All right, just go on now, believing that you're going to hear perfect, and you'll hear.\n\nL-263 Is all sins confessed, sister? [The sister says, \"Yes.\"--Ed.] You're ready for your healing? [\"Yes.\"]\n\nL-264 Dear God, I lay my hands upon my sister, knowing that in us is no good thing, in ourselves. But we know that we are Christians, borned of the Spirit of God. And we lay hands upon our sister and ask for her healing, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-265 Now you believe you're going to be healed? [The sister says, \"Fine!\"--Ed.] All right, now you--you are healed. [\"Yes!\"] That's the way to do it. That's right. Right.\n\nL-266 All sins are confessed? [The sister says, \"Yes, sir.\"--Ed.] And you're ready for your healing? [\"Yes.\"] You believe, by laying on of hands, that the God Who knows the hearts of the people, will make you well? [\"I do.\"]\n\nL-267 Our Heavenly Father, I pray that You'll heal our sister, as we lay our hands upon her and ask in the Name of Jesus Christ that You'll make her well. Amen.\n\nL-268 How do you do? Of course, you know I know what's wrong with you. [The sister says, \"Yeah.\"--Ed.] But I'm just not saying it; 'cause, you do, it'll--it'll just keep on going on and on. [\"All right.\"] But if you will... Is all sins confessed? [\"Yes, sir.\"] And you believe that God will make you well? [\"Yes, sir.\"] Do you believe the arthritis... I done said it.\n\nL-269 Dear God, I pray that You will help her and make her well. Grant it, in Jesus' Name. You won't be crippled. Go, believe with all your heart.\n\nL-270 Do you believe that God will make you well? [The sister says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] All sins are confessed and you are ready for your healing? You believe your back will be all right?\n\nL-271 Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You will heal her and make her well. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may it be so. Amen. God bless you, sister. Go, believing now.\n\nL-272 Is all sins confessed, sister, you are ready for your healing?\n\nL-273 Dear God, her sins, she says, is confessed. I lay my hands upon this woman, in the Name of Jesus Christ, ask for her healing. Amen.\n\nL-274 Are all sins confessed? You must be right, you're very sick, you know that. You know that I know what's wrong with you. And do you believe that God will make you well, heal your heart and make you completely well?\n\nL-275 Dear God, I pray that in the Name of Jesus Christ, that You'll heal her and make her well. May this leave her, Father, in Jesus' Name. Amen. God bless you now. Don't doubt. Go, believing.\n\nL-276 Sins all confessed? You're ready for healing?\n\nL-277 Dear Heavenly Father, I lay my hands upon our sister. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may she be healed. Amen. Don't doubt. Go, believing.\n\nL-278 All sins confessed, you're ready for healing?\n\nL-279 Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You will heal our brother, will make him well. Grant it, Father. I lay my hands on him, for this purpose, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. I believe it with all my heart.\n\nL-280 Are you believing now, sister? All sins are confessed and you're ready for healing?\n\nL-281 Dear God, I lay my hands upon sister, in the Name of Jesus Christ, may she be healed for Your glory. Amen.\n\nL-282 Now just many times like that, just a touch, as Jesus said, \"These signs will follow them that believe. If they lay 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min their hands on the sick.\" I've begin to notice, in the meetings, that it takes effect fifty percent better than what it does when you call the people in line, have discernment, 'cause you only get to just a few. And, this a way, there is many more gets healed.\n\nL-283 Have you confessed all your sins of unbelief and everything? You believe now that you're going to be healed? [The sister says, \"Yes, and delivered.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-284 Dear God, I pray that You'll heal our sister as I take her hands and ask in the Name of Jesus Christ for her healing. Amen. God bless you, sister.\n\nL-285 Do you believe now? [The sister says, \"Yes.\"--Ed.] All sins are confessed? [\"Yes.\"]\n\nL-286 Dear God, I lay my hands upon our sister, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for her healing. Amen. God bless you, sister. Seems like a very small thing, but it's God Who promised it.\n\nL-287 Sins are confessed?\n\nL-288 Dear God, I pray that You'll heal this our sister. As I lay hands upon her in the Name of Jesus Christ, may she go and be well. Amen.\n\nL-289 Sins are confessed?\n\nL-290 Dear God, I pray that You'll heal our sister, as I lay hands upon her, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-291 Now as you come with the mechanics, may it strike the dynamics, it'll go to work.\n\nL-292 Sins are confessed? [The sister then answers--Ed.] You are ready.\n\nL-293 Dear God, I pray that You will heal her and make her well, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, sister.\n\nL-294 All sins confessed? [The sister says, \"Everything.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-295 Dear God, as this woman looks me in the eye, I believe that. I pray that You will heal her, in Jesus' Name.\n\nL-296 You just bringing her, are you, sister? You're just bringing her? All right. [The sister says, \"She is blind, also.\"--Ed.] You believe, sister, that God will make you well? [The blind sister says, \"I believe God could give me eyesight again.\"] God bless you.\n\nL-297 Heavenly Father, You're always merciful to the blind, and to the needy. Now they have seen what You've done tonight. So we believe, Lord, this great last sign moving among us now. I ask for this blind woman's sight to come to her, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-298 [She which was blind, says, \"Thank You, Jesus.\"--Ed.] Now, report to us now. Report it. [\"I will!\"]\n\nL-299 [She which brought the blind sister, requests prayer--Ed.] Oh, yes, you believe that God will heal you? [\"Hallelujah!\"]\n\nL-300 Dear Heavenly Father I lay my hands upon our sister and ask that You heal her, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-301 God bless you, sister. Let us hear how you are, how you get along.\n\nL-302 Do you believe, sister? [The sister says, \"Yes, I do.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-303 O Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for our sister, trusting that You will heal her now. I lay my hands on her, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Now believe. That's right. Just go, believing.\n\nL-304 Do you believe, brother? [The brother says, \"Yes.\"--Ed.] All sins confessed?\n\nL-305 Dear God, I pray that You will heal our brother and make him well, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nL-306 You believe, sister? 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min\n\nL-307 O God, I pray that, in Jesus Christ's Name, humbly, in the sweetness and meekness of this hour, may the Holy Spirit make this woman whole. [The sister says, \"And I ask, pray for my son. I haven't seen him for twenty years.\"--Ed.] I pray that God will send your son to you, sister, dear. God bless you.\n\nL-308 Dear Father, I pray for our sister here. In the sweetness of the Holy Spirit, may He come now and heal our sister, in Jesus' Name. Amen. Bless you, sister.\n\nL-309 Dear God, I pray for my brother, as he stands here and I lay hands upon him, and ask for his healing, in Jesus' Name.\n\nL-310 Bless you, my brother. [The brother says, \"God bless you.\"] All right. Little boy?\n\nL-311 Dear God, laying hands upon the little one, I bless him in the Name of Jesus Christ, for his healing.\n\nL-312 You believe now, sister? [The sister says, \"Yes.\"--Ed.] You want to be prayed for too?\n\nL-313 Dear God, I pray for her, as I lay hands upon her. Now, this is Your commission, that's what You said do, \"These signs shall follow them that believe. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" You said it, Lord. Amen. Now, He said that, didn't He? Has to be that way, sister.\n\nL-314 Dear God, I pray that You'll heal our sister and make her well, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, sister.\n\nL-315 You've come believing, sister?\n\nL-316 Dear Heavenly Father, I ask Your blessings on our sister, just obeying what You said do. You said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe. If they lay their hands on the sick,\" You said, \"they shall recover.\"\n\nL-317 May I stop here just a moment, to say in this, just to let the people rest a moment, just for a moment. A critic once said, to me, that isn't so. But, you see, He said, \"These signs shall follow.\"\n\nL-318 You've heard my Message on The Trial, putting Jesus on trial. See, He told Noah, \"It was going to rain.\" It never rained for a hundred and twenty years, but it rained anyhow. He told Abraham he'd have a son by Sarah. It was twenty-five years later. He never said when. He said they'd have the son. Twenty-five years later, it happened. See, He didn't say when.\n\nL-319 He said, \"The prayer of faith shall save the sick. God shall raise them up. If they lay hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" Is that what He said? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] He didn't say they'd jump up and do it right then. He said, \"They shall recover.\" See, that's His promise. That's what we believe. [James 5:15]\n\nL-320 Come, sister. You believe that to be true? [The sister says, \"Yes, I do.\"--Ed.] Then there is no way to keep you from being healed.\n\nL-321 I lay my hands upon sister, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for her healing. Amen.\n\nL-322 Do you believe, sister? [The sister says, \"Yes.\"--Ed.] All sins confessed, and ready?\n\nL-323 Dear God, I lay my hands upon sister, in obedience to Your commandment, and ask for her healing, in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-324 I want you that's being prayed for, I want you to do me a favor. I want you to report, before these meetings are over, what happens; and just let the audience, the other people, see what really takes place. Maybe tomorrow, next day, or when, you just watch what takes place.\n\nL-325 My mail has showed that it's--it's so much different than just to letting them try, test their own faith. Because, Jesus said, \"They lay hands upon them. They lay hands upon them, they shall recover.\" Now get what He said. He didn't say they'd jump up and run up-and- down the floor. They could do that. But He said, \"They shall recover.\" Is that what He said? That's what He said. That's what I believe. And He is here now, the One that said the Word is here to make it so. 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min\n\nL-326 You believe, sir? [The brother says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-327 Dear Heavenly Father, upon the confession of his faith and believing, I lay my hands upon him, in Jesus Christ's Name, for his healing.\n\nL-328 Dear God, I lay my hands upon this woman, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for her healing. All right.\n\nL-329 Dear Father, I lay my hands upon this woman, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for her healing. You said, \"She shall recover.\"\n\nL-330 Ready for healing, sister?\n\nL-331 Dear God, I lay my hands upon her, in the Name of Jesus Christ, that You'll heal her.\n\nL-332 All right, sister, dear, everything ready for healing? Your faith has now been met, you believe you're going to be well?\n\nL-333 And, God, I lay my hands upon her, in obeying Your commandment, \"To all the world, every creature.\" I lay hands upon her, in Jesus' Name, for her healing.\n\nL-334 Dear God, I lay my hands upon my brother, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for his healing.\n\nL-335 Dear God, I lay my hands upon my sister, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for her healing.\n\nL-336 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... going down the aisle. I just didn't want to weary you. You'll be alright if you'll believe that now.\n\nL-337 Dear God, I pray that You'll heal my sister, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nL-338 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... to help me pray for these people.\n\nL-339 Now we got some handkerchiefs here, and so forth, in here, to be prayed over. And I want you to continue to pray with me now, now, these little parcels, now. I know this sounds very strange for people to pray over a little thing like this. But if you could only come into my office, once, and just watch. If we had kept testimonies through these years, I suppose you couldn't have piled on this platform, that's been healed just by sending out these prayer cloths like this, millions of them, around and around the world. Now, you know what it is--it is?\n\nL-340 Somebody get that handkerchief there for that--that young... You'll know your handkerchief, will you, brother? All right.\n\nL-341 And I have seen little, crippled children healed. And you see, what it is, it's just a point of contact, as Oral Roberts used to say. It's just a point of contact. We pray. Now, we don't do this ourselves, we do this because the Bible commissions us to do this. We all know that's true.\n\nL-342 Now, there is many people that they anoint handkerchiefs, and so forth. Well, now, we think that's all right, sure, but if we just... The Bible didn't say that they \"anointed\" handkerchiefs.\n\nL-343 \"But they took from the body of Paul handkerchiefs.\" Now see what I was talking about? Now, what they seen, that quickening power that was in Paul, that they knew he was God's servant. They knowed that God was in him. They knowed that everything that he touched was blessed. How many understands that? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] [Acts 19:12]\n\nL-344 You know, I think Paul was quite Scriptural in what he done. Don't you think so? You want me to tell you where I think he got the idea of doing it? [Someone says, \"From Elisha.\"--Ed.] From Elisha, is right. See, Elijah said, \"Take this staff and go lay it on the baby.\" And the prophet sent the staff because he knowed that everything that he touched was blessed. He knew his position. He... if he could just get the woman to believe the same thing.\n\nL-345 Now see, now, the Bible never even said, \"They shall pray for the sick.\" It said, \"They shall lay hands on the sick.\" [Mark 16:18]\n\nL-346 Now just think, the people seen, in the apostle Peter, the Presence of God manifested in this man, insomuch that they--they even laid the people in his shadow, and they were healed. How many knows that's Scriptural? [Congregation 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] That's just as much Scripture as John 3:16. See, It's all God's Word. Now, the people, you know the shadow of that man did not heal the people.\n\nL-347 But, look, if the power of God was upon that prophet, for years and years after he died, insomuch that a dead man was throwed on his body, his bones. The body wasn't even there; the bones was there. And the Presence of God was upon those bones, until that dead man come to life.\n\nL-348 Now don't you know that that same God that did all those things is right here tonight? To--to me, I think we should be the most happiest people in all the world. Just think of this.\n\nL-349 I--I hope that I haven't impressed my audience to believe that it's something that I do myself. You--you know better than that. I, I am your brother, see, and I am just your brother.\n\nL-350 But I do know, I do know this, that God is here. And I know that He has given something to us, that we cannot explain it, only by the Word of God, claims that it should be here at this time. So, it also gives us identification to know that we're living in the last days. It gives us identification to know that this people, this chosen, elected, called-out, predestinated...\n\nL-351 Now, that's a big word, predestinate, but we all know that it's the truth. We absolutely know that the infinite God predestinated all things by foreknowledge before the foundation of the world, even the Lamb was slain; and every name that would ever be on the Book, was put on the Book before the Book was ever written. Now how many knows that's true? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-352 And Jesus came to--to redeem those that were in the Book. In the Bible, the Lamb came from behind the curtain, and taken the Book and opened the Seals that It was sealed with, for He came to claim all He had redeemed. He's the Intercessor now, an Intercessor making intercessions for those who He has redeemed. All whose name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life, is redeemed.\n\nL-353 As I made a crude little statement the other night... I'm waiting for you all to get these handkerchiefs here. I'm not just trying to preach over again, but I said there was a little statement... I hope this don't sound sacrilegious, see. But like the farmer that set the hen, and didn't have enough eggs, so he got an eagle egg, and he set it under the hen and she hatched out an eagle. And he was a very odd fellow amongst all the chickens, because they didn't see things alike. But that's all he ever seen, was the hen. He only heard one voice, it didn't sound like his voice. Neither could he make a voice like the hen or the chicken. He didn't appreciate their diet, as they eat from the barnyard. There was something different about him, yet he didn't know what the difference was.\n\nL-354 And then one day, there was the mother eagle that knowed she had layed so many eggs. And there was one of those eggs, which was to be her son, was missing. So she went hunting for him, and she found him in the barnyard. And she screamed. And when she screamed, the little eagle knew the voice of the mother. As Jesus said, \"My sheep know My Voice.\"\n\nL-355 I think, last night, when I seen that panel of Baptists, Presbyterian, and whatmore, they might have been brought out under a hen. Excuse me, brother, see. But Mother knew She had Her darlings out there somewhere. So them men standing there, not disputing the feeding they had got from the mother hen, and so forth, but now they're eagles, you see, they fly for their food. See?\n\nL-356 And I think the church is something like a scene I seen not long ago, coming down from Tucson, or from--from Phoenix, going to Tucson. I saw a mysterious sight. And it kind of broke my heart, to see what had taken place, how... a hawk, that used to fly in the air, a brother to the eagle, which is a type of the church.\n\nL-357 And Jehovah is the Eagle. He called His prophets \"eagles.\" He called Himself, Jehovah, \"Eagle.\"\n\nL-358 But this hawk has long lost its identification, because it doesn't no more sail through the air and hunt its meat like it's supposed to. But it sits on the telephone wires and acts like a scavenger. He--he hunts for dead rabbits that the cars has killed, and him and the vultures get out there and eat together. He hops like a vulture, instead of walking like he should walk. He has lost his identification. 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min\n\nL-359 And I say this with all godly love and respect, the church has long lost her identification as a sister eagle. She sits around. Instead of digging into the Word and find whether these things are right, she waits for a bunch of Sunday school literature that's been made up by a bunch of intellectuals somewhere, some dead rabbit that's been killed somewhere else. Hops like a vulture! God help us to fly away from that.\n\nL-360 These promises are true. Not what somebody said about It, but what God said about them! They are true. I'm so glad to be associated with eagles. Let us pray together for our sick ones.\n\nL-361 Dear Heavenly Father, it is taught in the Bible that they taken from the body of Paul, handkerchiefs and aprons, and demons went out of people, and unclean spirits left them. Now, Father, me standing here over these handkerchiefs, represents every person that's present. It's the Body of Christ, us together. We are claiming, by grace and love, that we are here to represent His Bride, and believing, associate with Him in His Kingdom. And we know we're not Saint Paul, but we know You're still Jesus.\n\nL-362 And we pray that You will honor the faith of these people. If they had lived back in the days of Paul, they'd have heard this same Gospel, seen these same things. Therefore, they're the same kind of people. You're the same God. So I pray, Dear God, that You'll honor their faith, like You did those in the Bible days. And may every demon power, every sickness, every affliction, that's bound the people that these handkerchiefs and parcels here represent, may that evil power of sickness leave them.\n\nL-363 It was said, one time, that Israel was walking in the line of duty, to a promised land. And right in the line of duty, the enemy come and backed them up in a corner, and the Red Sea cut them off from the line of duty, and in their march. And God looked down from the heavens, through the Pillar of Fire, and the sea got scared. It rolled back its waves, because God's waves was in the bottom of the sea. And It made way for His children, walking in the line of obedience.\n\nL-364 Now, God, if the Red Sea would get scared, and roll back its waves, roll back its waters, and give place to a journeying children marching in obedience; Dear God, tonight, look down through the Blood of Your Son, Jesus, Who made the promise. And when these handkerchiefs are placed upon the sick bodies of the people, may the eyes of God look, and may that sickness, that devil, be scared and move away. And may the people keep the journey to the promised Land, with good health and strength. As Israel marched through the wilderness, there wasn't one feeble person among them, at the other end. May it be granted to these people, Father, for we send these handkerchiefs, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-365 God bless you, each one. As you get your handkerchiefs now, you believe with all your heart. Do you believe that God hears this? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] See? I, I want to say this. Don't, don't doubt, one bit. See, it may seem real strange. Excuse me, just a minute. Don't doubt, one bit. But believe now that, what we have asked, God gives.\n\nL-366 Do you believe that's God here, knows the secret of your heart? You know and believe that's God? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now just settle your mind now, it can't be nothing else. See?\n\nL-367 Now, what if there would be a great tomorrow, way years ago this will be history. And when people, in years to come, if it was to be such, they'd come and say, \"Well, if I would have been living then, I'd seen that done, boy, that's all I would have had to know. I'd have believed it right then!\" See, the same thing that you believe, if you had been back there when they done it then! Remember, it's still Him. It's His Life in you. God bless you.

I will try to be faster tonight, and just so that we can hurry up and--and pray for the sick. I certainly felt good about last night's meeting. They seemed like that there was many people got healed. And I had plenty of support, everybody praying, and together. That's the way we stand. So, the Lord bless you. Now, I think, tomorrow night we're to be... I guess they've already announced it. It's another--another place. All right.\n\nL-3 Now let's turn in the Book of Numbers, the 22nd chapter, right quick, for just a little text, to pass a few comments, and then we're going to place the most of the time in the prayer line.\n\nL-4 Billy said he gave out enormous amount of cards, two or three hundred of them. And it'll take quite a while to get them through the prayer line, so I--I will just speak for a few minutes, not over thirty minutes, if possible, and then start the prayer line, pray for the sick. In Deuteronomy, in... Pardon me.\n\nL-5 Numbers, 22nd chapter and the 31st verse, I wish to read this. And the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face. [Numbers 22:31]\n\nL-6 Now this may sound like a rude little text for just to--to give a stand and to have our healing service. And I'm going to try to have the prayer line started by nine o'clock, if possible. Now I want to take the subject tonight: Does God Change His Mind?\n\nL-7 You know, we can change our mind, and because we--we learn a little different, we know we were wrong.\n\nL-8 But I don't believe that God can change His mind. Because, if He does, then He certainly could not be infinite, and He could make a better decision if He would change it. So He... The faith that I have in Him, that--that He doesn't change His mind. Because if God ever makes a decision, He has to stay with that decision. See? And each time the same problem comes up, He has got to act in the same way He did the first time, or He acted wrong in the first time. See? So it gives us somewhere to have a--a basic faith. Now we cannot...\n\nL-9 Yes, faith isn't just a loose leaf, something that you can fly it here and over somewhere else. It's something that's got to be sure. It's got to be stable. And, now, I cannot base my faith upon some theory. It's got to be a proven fact before I can have faith.\n\nL-10 Just like a man choosing a wife, to marry. Why, he, he has got to have faith in that woman, he marries her, he certainly is fixing hisself for a lot of trouble. See? So he's got to, you got to have faith, some solid facts, some faith to base it upon; upon her word, upon what somebody else has said, or something. He's got to have something to place his face on, faith on.\n\nL-11 So I feel that, to meet God, there is just one thing that I can base my faith upon and that's His Word.\n\nL-12 Because, we have different ideas, pretty near all of us. We'd sit down and go to even talking about something to eat, why, we would different on something to eat; and we're made different, our appetites are different. And therefore it makes our churches, we see they are different in their ideas of what is right and what's wrong. That gives us, every one, a privilege to take a choice. 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min\n\nL-13 But, to me, I--I believe that the Word of God is right. And I--I don't believe it's of any private interpretation. I believe it's just what It says, that's the Truth. And that's the way I take it, just on the basics of It being the Word of God. Now, I haven't got faith enough, maybe, to make all of it act, but I certainly wouldn't want to stand in the way of somebody who did have faith enough to make It act. [II Peter 1:20]\n\nL-14 Like, for instance, Enoch had enough faith that he didn't have to die. He just took an afternoon stroll, and got tired here on earth and just walked on up to Heaven. I'd certainly like to have faith like that. But I hope that we do get that faith someday, as we grow on into Him. Now our... [Genesis 5:24], [Hebrews 11:5]\n\nL-15 The reason I chose this place, because it seems like that here, to me, is one of the places in the Bible that would be a--a critical place for the text tonight, because it looks like that God did change His mind, and told Balaam one thing to do and then told him something else to do. So I thought, maybe, just for a while, we'll try to straighten this out just a little, and see what He really told him. [Numbers 22:10-22]\n\nL-16 So now to outline this. We know that Balaam was a--a--a prophet. And Balak was the king of Moab, at the time. And they were not infidels, up at Moab, they served the same God that Israel served. Because, Moab, the nation was founded by Lot's son, by his daughter, and so they served the same God. If you notice, their sacrifices and everything was just exactly the same, bullocks, and also the rams, speaking of the second Coming. And now if fundamentalism is all that God requires, then Moab was just as fundamental in his offering as what Israel was. But we find them now, Israel is in the line of following the Word of God, to a land that had been promised them. And they come... [Genesis 19:30, 37]\n\nL-17 Here would be a type of the natural and spiritual, meeting. And when the natural and spiritual meets, there is always a collision, because they run right head-on into each other. And Israel here, would, I want to represent it as a spiritual Church; and Moab as the natural church, just the church, what we call, church natural.\n\nL-18 And we're all sure that there is a--a church, and there is a Bride coming out of that church. We know that, that that is true.\n\nL-19 And they clash here. And we notice that when they clashed here, it come under something that I would like to speak a moment on. As soon as they clashed, and one seen what the other one was doing, there was a great impersonation, one of the other.\n\nL-20 And that's where we find it today, that we do get too much impersonations. And when you do that, you're always in trouble. You cannot live the other fellow's life. We cannot impersonate something. We must be just what we are. You mustn't (never) try to. If this fellow does something; because he does it, you think you have to, too. You don't do that. You're an individual, to God. And we mustn't try to impersonate each other.\n\nL-21 And now, Israel, right in the line of duty, marching on their way to a command, by a commandment of God, to a promised land, they clashed with Moab, another group of believers.\n\nL-22 And I hope this doesn't sound too bad. But the little illustration I want to make here is, Moab being settled down in a land, he was more like an organized affair. He had his celebrities, and his dignitaries of the... of his kingdom.\n\nL-23 But Israel was just a--a wanderer. They had no certain place they went. They just wandered as the Lord led them. Now, I believe, also, Balaam, later in his prophecy, said, \"The people would not be among the nations. It would just be a scattered.\" And that's what it's always been. And we find out, the clash come.\n\nL-24 Just as Cain and Abel, they also came together in a clash. And them being brothers, and both of them of the same mother, Eve. And we find that they realized that they were mortal, and they had been put out of Life, out of the garden of Life. And they both was trying to find a way to get back in There. And if you noticed, both boys was very religious. Cain was just as religious as Abel was. And they both built altars, otherwise, a church. They both made sacrifice. They both prayed. And they--they served God, both of them, but one of them served Him wrong. [Genesis 4:8], [Genesis 4:3-4]\n\nL-25 Now, you see, you can be ever so sincere and yet be wrong. You can be wrong. \"There is a way that seemeth right, but the end thereof is the ways of death.\" [Proverbs 16:25] 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min\n\nL-26 Now we--we see that this was so true with Cain and Abel. And when they seen... Cain saw that Abel's sacrifice was received. And, I might stop here to say, why did God receive his sacrifice? Is because that--that he was... By a revelation, he understood that it was not apples, or I believe now they got it the pomegranates or something that they eat in the garden of Eden, that caused sin. And he found Adam... or, I mean, Abel believed that it (he) it was blood. Which, it really was. And Abel, by revelation, faith, offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain; which God testified by it, he was righteous. See? And the whole Church is built upon a Divine revelation of the Word of God. The whole... [Genesis 4:4], [Hebrews 11:4]\n\nL-27 Jesus said so. One day, coming down off the mount, He said to His disciples, \"Who do you say I the Son of man am? Or who does people say I am?\" [Matthew 16:14], [Luke 9:18-20]\n\nL-28 \"And some of them said, well, You're 'Moses,' You're 'Elias,' or 'one of the prophets.'\" He said, \"But who do you say I am?\" [Matthew 16:14-15]\n\nL-29 And Peter made that great statement, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God!\" [Luke 9:20], [Matthew 16:16]\n\nL-30 He said, \"Blessed art thou, Simon, son of Jonas.\" And here is the great argument amongst believers. [Matthew 16:17-18]\n\nL-31 Now the Catholic church says that, \"There He--He built His Church upon Peter, for He said, 'Thou art Peter,' little stone, 'upon this stone, little stone, I'll build My Church.'\"\n\nL-32 Well, now, the Protestant mostly believe that it was upon Himself that He built, upon Him, the Cornerstone. But, you see, He was the Cornerstone to the building. I believe that what He built the Church upon...\n\nL-33 Not to be different, but, you see, the question was, \"Who does man say I am?\" And Peter said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" [Matthew 16:14-16]\n\nL-34 He said, \"Blessed art thou, Simon, son of Jonas, flesh and blood never revealed this to you. You never learned this by going to a seminary. See, you never learned this by some man-made affair. But My Father, which is in Heaven, has revealed this to you. See? Upon this Rock I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell cannot prevail against It,\" the spiritual revelation of Jesus Christ, Who is the Word. Then it would be the spiritual revealed Truth of the Word, is exactly where the Church rests. [Matthew 16:17-18]\n\nL-35 I think that's what Abel had at the beginning, a spiritual revelation that it wasn't the fruit of the field or the works of our hands, or so forth. It was blood. And he offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than--than Cain did. [Hebrews 11:4]\n\nL-36 We find in Abraham and Lot, the same thing, in a choice, because Lot went down, when the time come, when the spiritual and the--and the natural church come in a clash, because of the herdsmen. They had to separate one for another. And whenever this does, it sets up a jealousy. [Genesis 13:7, 9]\n\nL-37 We find out that Abel, be because God had received him, and He did not receive Cain's beautiful big offering, he had toiled so hard for. And was religious, and bowed down and worshiped, and so forth, done everything that Abel did, only he didn't have the revelation of what was the truth. So we find out, that when God accepted Abel's revelation and his offering, it made Cain get jealous of Abel. And there was the first murder. [Genesis 4:8]\n\nL-38 We find out that jealousy become between the herdsmen of Abraham and Lot, and they had to separate. We find out that Moses and Korah had a clash, also. Jesus and Judas had a clash. [Genesis 13:9]\n\nL-39 And as ever, it's been the same thing, and so is it today, the natural church and the spiritual church has a clash when they come together. Now, the natural tries to match the spiritual, always with a carnal impersonation. But, as it was with Esau and Jacob, it will not work.\n\nL-40 God has His Church called, named, set aside. And in the age that She lives in, He'll reveal Himself to Her, each and every time, just as He said in Romans the 8th chapter, that the foreknowledge or predestination of God might stand sure. Cain, or I mean... [Romans 8:29] 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min\n\nL-41 Esau and Jacob, before either boy was born, before they even had a chance to make a choice, God said, \"I hate Esau and love Jacob,\" for He knew what was in them, from the beginning. And we know... [Romans 9:13]\n\nL-42 Keep that in mind, He knows what's in your heart. He knows what you mean. No matter what we say, He knows what you mean.\n\nL-43 And it's always caused trouble. And they, the... always, the natural always tries, since Cain destroyed Abel, the natural has always tried to destroy the effects of the spiritual. We find it the same thing today, the very same thing today. It proves that it comes from Satan, because it's jealousy and impersonation of Truth.\n\nL-44 So, we really believe that God never changes His mind about what He said. He always keeps It true.\n\nL-45 But He has a permissive will. Now, there, where the trouble lays. We try to work on God's permissive will, and He will permit it. But also if we take His permissive will, though it's not right, He will make His permissive will to work out, together, to glorify His perfect will. [II Kings 20:1-6], [Isaiah 38:1-8]\n\nL-46 There is nothing will go wrong, with God. We're... He knows just where the clock is a-ticking at, tonight. There is nothing wrong. Every lick is hitting just exactly the way it should be, everything. We think it's wrong, but He knows it's right. It's supposed to be like this.\n\nL-47 Like at the beginning, God just permitted sin to come. He didn't, not... That wasn't His perfect will.\n\nL-48 But, you see, God, the great Spirit, the Father, in Him was attributes, and these things that you see displayed now is just His attributes being displayed. He dwelt alone, He was not even God; God was an object of worship. He was the Great Eternal One. And in Him was attributes, such as to be Father, to be Saviour, to be Healer. And now, how could He first... He had to be Father, because it proves He was Father, but He dwells alone. He alone is immortal. And, now, but His attributes has to be displayed.\n\nL-49 Now, to be a Saviour, there has to be something lost. And God cannot purposely lose anything and then redeem it. It wouldn't be becoming to His holiness and His great judgment. But He put man on free moral agency, knowing that man would fall. And in that, then, He became man, Himself, in order to redeem back man that fell. That's the reason that Jesus was Emmanuel. If God sent another person besides Himself, then that wouldn't be just. God had to come Himself and take place. And God could not be come down in Spirit and take place, He had to be made flesh, in the flesh of His Own creative Son. [Matthew 1:23]\n\nL-50 And He showed here, in the beginning, that His perfect will was to create man out of the dust of the earth. But, you see, He permitted sex to be brought in. He never did intend children to be born by sex, but it was permitted, which soon will fade away. [Genesis 2:7]\n\nL-51 Now we find out that Moab was an illegitimate, to--to begin with, because it was Lot's son, by his own daughter. Now notice, as the natural church, Moab repre-... represents the--the natural church, Moab does. And Israel, the spiritual church, now, Israel, the bride, was the... represents the called-out. [Genesis 19:30-37]\n\nL-52 The Church Itself, the word church means \"called-out one, come out,\" those who have come out. \"Come out of her, My people! Be ye separated, saith the Lord, and I will receive you unto Myself. Touch not their unclean things.\" The Church of God is called out of the world, out of the chaos of the world. You're no more of the world. [II Corinthians 6:17]\n\nL-53 As I was trying to say, the other night, to you, it's when you know that you have the earnest of your--of your Eternal redemption right now in you, by the baptism of the Holy Spirit, it's already quickened you. You are now risen with Him, and we're sitting together in Heavenly places, in Christ Jesus. See, you're no more of the world. If you love the world, and your affections are still on the things of the world, then the love of God is not even in you. See? We are from, free from the world. There is no more desire. [Ephesians 2:6]\n\nL-54 In the Hebrews, I believe the 10th chapter, said, \"There was a continually remembrance of sin, each year, those beasts' body was offered. But in this case, the worshiper once purged has no more conscience of sin, no more desire to sin.\" The whole thing is gone from you, because you have been quickened into a new Life. [Hebrews 10:1] 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min\n\nL-55 And then the church natural is just a bunch of people in denominations, that joined. It's no more... I don't even no more call it \"church.\" I don't like to refer to it. I like to refer to it as a \"lodge,\" Methodist lodge, Baptist lodge, Pentecostal lodge.\n\nL-56 But the Church is the borned-again that's in Christ Jesus, that's new creatures. And so we still see that, that God keeps His Word.\n\nL-57 Now Moab seen, Moab looked down upon the field and seen God moving amongst this people who was not even an organized nation. They were just floating around, from place to place. But the strange thing, that, they come upon these nations and they took them. Everything was in their road, they took them. Now, they found out, Moab looking upon it. Balak, he looked down upon the nation of Israel, and he said, \"The people cover the whole face of the earth.\" He said, \"And they lick up the nations, just like an ox licking up grass.\" [Numbers 22:4]\n\nL-58 And they found out, one of the great key-notes was that how they got this great revelation, there was a prophet among them. They had a prophet, now, someone that led them. It wasn't a man-made system like he was used to, his--his delegations with him, and so forth, but it and his dignitaries. But they had a--a leader, a Divine-called leader.\n\nL-59 And, oh, what a sad day it was, when the church world left off the Divine leadership of the Holy Ghost, and adopted a bishop or anything else to take Its place. It was a sad day. The Holy Spirit is to be the leader of the church. He is sent to confirm the Words of Jesus Christ, to make the church live as it did live at the beginning. [John 16:13]\n\nL-60 Now long ago, a very famous school here in--in this city, a seminary. And they have one in Phoenix. And one of the man, or a couple of the students, was, came down to me and said, \"We like you, Brother Branham. We don't have nothing again' you, at all, but we'd just like to straighten you out.\"\n\nL-61 And I said, \"Well, I sure want to be straightened out.\" So, and so I said, \"If I'm wrong, I certainly don't want to be wrong; I talk to too many people.\"\n\nL-62 And he said, \"Well, here is your trouble.\" Said, \"You are trying to introduce, or to make live again, an apostolic religion. When, the apostolic religion ceased with the apostles.\" And I said, \"Yes, sir.\" I said, \"Well, now if...\" He said, \"Now, I wouldn't debate it with you.\"\n\nL-63 I said, \"I wouldn't either. We don't. We're not supposed to do that. We're brethren.\" And he said, \"Well,\" he said, \"I would just like to help you.\" I said, \"I'm certainly willing to get help.\" And he said, \"Now, you see,\" he said, \"now the... that's true.\"\n\nL-64 And I said, \"Now, on talking, we mustn't use textbooks.\" I said, \"I won't use mine,\" and I had none but This one. But so--so I said, \"I won't use textbook, just the Bible. And, you, we just use the Bible.\" He said, \"All right.\"\n\nL-65 I said, \"Now, we believe that the apostolic church begin at the Day of Pentecost. Do you agree with that?\" He said, \"Yes, I do.\" [Acts 2:1]\n\nL-66 I said, \"Now we realize that God gave the church power there, for these apostolic movements.\" [Acts 1:8]\n\nL-67 He said, \"Yes, that was the framework of the Church. Now the Church is already set in order, and we got all of our pastors, and our great organizations and things. We don't need those things anymore, to draw people.\"\n\nL-68 I said, \"Now where does the Bible say that?\" I said, \"You tell me where the Bible says that at.\" See? And he said, \"Well, it doesn't exactly say that in that way.\"\n\nL-69 I said, \"Well, then, I can't receive it 'less it says it just in that way, see. See?\" I said, \"We're...\" I said, \"That's the way it has to be.\" I said, \"Do you believe that God is still calling people?\" He said, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nL-70 I said, \"Now you will believe that the Bible is correct, every answer?\" 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min \"Yeah.\"\n\nL-71 I said, \"Now, the spokesman at the Day of Pentecost, was Peter, who had the keys to the Kingdom.\" \"That's right.\" [Matthew 16:18-19]\n\nL-72 And I said, \"Now, whatever his decision was, Jesus said, 'What you bind on earth, I'll bind in Heaven; what you loose on earth, I'll loose in Heaven.'\" He said, \"I'll believe that.\"\n\nL-73 I said, \"Now, in Acts the 2nd chapter and the 38th verse, Peter said to those people who were marveling. These people speaking in unknown tongues. And they asked him what they could do to be saved, and he said, 'Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin, you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost; for the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.' Now if God is still calling, that same promise is for them.\" [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-74 Well, he come over here and was with one of Billy Graham's groups up here praying for a meeting. And a group of them was sitting up here in California somewhere, a few weeks ago, in real deep sincere prayer, consecrated to God, fasting, and the Holy Ghost fell on the whole bunch and begin to speak in other tongues. Yeah.\n\nL-75 Now he is a member of the--of the Friendly church, the Assemblies of God in Tucson, Arizona. He said, \"Oh, Brother Branham, I go up there and feel so good!\" Said, \"Just raise back my hands, and,\" said, \"the glory of God! I just sing!\" And said, \"I never could do that in a New Testament Baptist church.\" I said, \"I see you can't. That's why you're out.\" Yeah.\n\nL-76 So there you are, see, God keeps His Word. What He says, He'll do it. God has to keep His Word.\n\nL-77 Now we find out here, that, this carnal impersonation that Moab had. He saw this prophet among Israel, that was able to bless, curse, lead, and so forth, so he tries to match it, by politics. [Numbers 22:6]\n\nL-78 Now that's just what's taken place in the churches today. They have tried to match it with some kind of a system. You can't do it.\n\nL-79 The Holy Spirit must be alive in the Church, always, leading the Church for the age that It's living in, to confirm the Word that's promised for that age. God spoke the Word, from the beginning, and so much for this age, and so much for that age, and certain for them age. It always happens just that way. And, see, and the Holy Spirit must be alive in the Church, to make this Church live Its day. It must be here today, to confirm this latter-day ministry, latter-day signs, latter-day pour out of the Holy Ghost. It's just got to be here to do that, and you cannot get it through the working of systems. God has a system. He is the One Who has give us the Holy Spirit.\n\nL-80 Now, we notice here that Moses had a King, and that King was God, that anointed him. And Balaam also was under a king, Balak. And it was more like a political setup, see, Balak. Balaam, a prophet of God, he went to Balak for his information. Moses went to God for information. There was the difference.\n\nL-81 Yet, both of them were prophets, because they were both called of God; both met God, both talked to God, and both Spirit-filled. Now I'm coming home, see. Now, they were both Spirit-filled man. Now, that is true. The Bible said that, \"God met with Balaam and talked with him.\" See? [Numbers 22:9, 20]\n\nL-82 So we notice, each one of these prophets, both of them being prophets, man of God, they catered to their headship. Moses catered to God. And Balaam here catered to Balak.\n\nL-83 Notice here, in typing the spiritual and the natural, how perfect it was. Moses, sent by God, in a line of duty, is met and challenged by another man of God. Could you imagine such?\n\nL-84 But look what a setup they had up there. It was an organized nation.\n\nL-85 And Moses was leading the children of Israel, just as God would tell them where to go, led by a Pillar of Fire, and a supernatural Being that was leading the way. And Moses was getting his information through the--the Logos, of course, that went out of God, that Pillar of Fire; which was the Angel of the Covenant, which was Christ, the Anointed One. And he was getting his message through There, and giving it to the children of Israel, on the road to a promised 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min land. [Exodus 13:21]\n\nL-86 But this man was all settled down, and he had his kingdom. He had his churches. He had everything right there in order. So he sends over to get this man, to come over and to curse this people. And notice, could you imagine, that one prophet, one man of God seeing the works of God with another man, and try to--to challenge that works of God, when he knew, ought to have knowed better. Now Balaam, first when... Balak sent to him and told him, \"Come over and curse this people.\" Now Balak done the very thing, or... [Numbers 22:6]\n\nL-87 Balaam, rather, done the thing that was right, he sought God. He sought God, first. Now, that's what he ought to have done.\n\nL-88 And then God give him His perfect, clean-cut answer, \"Don't go with him! Leave them alone. Don't you curse those people. They are blessed.\" Now, that ought to be enough. When God says anything, He cannot change that. Notice, His perfect will was, \"Don't you go! Don't attack that people. They are My people.\" That was His perfect will. [Numbers 22:12]\n\nL-89 But Balaam didn't like those people, to begin with. See, there you are. How many Balaam's do we have today? The same thing, same thing! They know better.\n\nL-90 They had them in the days of our Lord Jesus. Nicodemus come and said, \"Rabbi, we know You're a man sent from God, or a--or a teacher sent from God. No man could do the things that You do unless God was with him.\" See, they looked. There was a Balaam again, see. [John 3:2]\n\nL-91 Now, Balaam didn't like the people. Notice his headquarters. After they had sent some fine man over there, to tell him, \"Now there is some people coming up down here. And I understand that you're a prophet, you're a great man, so you come up here and curse this people.\"\n\nL-92 Balaam said, \"Now, you wait a minute, till I go in and pray, and stay all night, maybe the Lord will meet me and He'll tell me.\" All right, the next morning, the Lord met with him and said, \"Don't go! Don't curse those people. They're blessed.\" [Numbers 22:8, 12]\n\nL-93 All right, Balaam went out and said, \"Well, I can't go, because the Lord told me not to go.\" [Numbers 22:13]\n\nL-94 Now notice when they went back, and took the headquarters, for him to go down there and stop this meeting they had, you see, well, then, come to find out, the headquarters sent a better set of people higher dignitaries, maybe a bishop, somebody else, or it might have been a state presbyter, somebody sent down there, \"Tell him to go down and stop that anyhow!\" See? [Numbers 22:17]\n\nL-95 Notice, his better influential group, better gifts, more money, said, \"I can exalt you to a better position. I might make you, instead of just being an ordinary man, I can make you a little higher now. I have the right to do that, because I'm king here in this great movement. And I--I can do something better for you, if you'll just do it.\"\n\nL-96 Notice, the new offer blinded him. He ought to have knowed; what God said, God will do. But it blinded him. And as a prophet of God, he should have not been influenced by such a group. He should have got out of that group, to begin with.\n\nL-97 And if I'm talking to some man of God here! When they try to tell you at the headquarters, that, \"The days of miracles is passed,\" and this what we're doing here, and the Lord Jesus is blessing us, \"and that's a bunch of fanaticism, work-up and emotion, there is no such a thing as Divine healing,\" get out of that group, right there. [Brother Branham snaps his finger--Ed.] Get out of it, because It's the Word of God being made manifest. They say, \"There is no such a thing as apostolic days. There is no baptism of the Holy Ghost. That speaking in tongues, there is nothing to it there.\"\n\nL-98 Oh, but, brother, don't you listen to that! There is a many one like Balaam, today, sitting back in their office, reading these Books of the Bible and know that It's the Truth. But yet just because of position's sake, they won't take their stand. Just exactly right. Notice, God... He knew he shouldn't have been in this group, or Balaam should have knew it. They, they get out of the will of God. Them fellows will talk you right out of the will of God. When you find the will of God, don't let nobody talk you out of it. 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min\n\nL-99 I've knowed of good people, come to the meetings, get healed, and go back. And they'd say, \"Oh, well, there is nothing to that. You're just worked up. There is nothing to it.\" And the people go to doubting. I've seen people come and receive Christ in their heart, go back; maybe speak in tongues, and go back. And the church will say, \"Why, you're a--you're a disgrace to Christianity,\" and so forth. And, oh, my, don't, don't do that, see. Get out of that group! Stay away from it.\n\nL-100 Notice, Balaam used a phony text here, for his conscience's sake, see. He said, \"Peradventure. You stay another night, and maybe I'll ask God, you see. Maybe He might have changed His mind.\"\n\nL-101 But God don't change His mind. When God give us the declaration of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, on the Day of Pentecost, that's the way He has to keep it. He did all through the Bible age, and He will any other time that man will come upon them basis that He offered there. If you will come, believing, repenting, being baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and believing on God, God is obligated to fulfill that prescription, right, 'cause He's the doctor. And He'll fulfill it if you will--if you will obey it. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-102 But you can't afford now to try to get this prescription, take it over to some quack druggist that--that might put something else in it. It might kill the patient. That's the reason we got so many dead church members today, they are trying to give the wrong prescription. God has got the prescription right here in the Bible. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. You've got to take the medicine the way the Doctor said give it. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-103 The Bible said, \"Is there no--is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there?\" Course, there is. Said, \"Then why is the daughter of My people in this condition?\" [Jeremiah 8:22]\n\nL-104 See, we got the Bible. We got the Physician. It's, just, the druggist is misfilling the Scripture prescription. That's what it is. You're trying to say, \"The days of miracles is past. There is no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all these things. It's nonsense.\" The Bible is exactly right. God doesn't take back anything He said. And they try to use a phony way out, something another like, \"Well, we believe that.\" Well, no matter what you believe!\n\nL-105 It's what God said! He said, \"I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh.\" He promised this in the last days. [Acts 2:17]\n\nL-106 They try to say the meetings, that you are seeing, they call me, \"a soothsayer, a--a--a polished-up soothsayer, or a--or a Beelzebub, or some devil.\" Well, they got to say that, because they're of their father. That's what he said about Jesus at the beginning. And it's not us doing this, anyhow, it's same Jesus, 'cause He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. It's His Spirit. [Matthew 10:25], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-107 Oh, something that could pass, by-pass and ful-... by-pass His commission. So many people try to by-pass that. \"Oh, come join the church, and it'll be all right. We're an old church. We've been here for many years. We started...\" Yes, that's right. If that's so, then the Roman Catholic church has got it on all of you; they're the first of the organizations. They was first. But, remember, not the first Church. They was the first organization, and the mother of every one of them. Which, every one of them is contrary to God. Revelation 17 says the same thing, see. Yes, we are in the last days. Now, remember, God will let you, though, see, now. And then Balaam, he thought, \"Well?\" [Revelation 17:5]\n\nL-108 Then God told him, \"Go on.\" Why? God knew what was in his heart. God knew that was in his heart to begin with, so He told him to, \"Go on.\" He will permit it. He will permit you to do it. He will bless you, many times, in doing it. [Numbers 22:20]\n\nL-109 He blessed even Israel after they... Grace had already give them a prophet, Pillar of Fire, a deliverance, signs and wonders, brought them out of Egypt, and everything, and yet they wanted a law. God let them have it, but He cursed them all the time.\n\nL-110 He let Balaam go on just the way he was supposed to, but what did he do? He went down there and, instead of cursing the people, he had to bless the people. He could not curse what God had blessed. [Numbers 24:10]\n\nL-111 And I--I told you, was going to quit at nine. And I looked up, and it's time now, and I got a book full of notes here.\n\nL-112 But I want to say this, in closing, that God never changed His mind. His direct will was for Balaam not to go. 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min And when God makes a statement, it has to ever remain true.\n\nL-113 Now, the Bible said, \"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" Now, that don't mean \"in a certain way.\" That means He's the same yesterday, today, and forever! Jesus said, in Saint John 14:12, \"He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also.\" Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] He promised, in Mark 16, \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\" They say, \"Well, that was just for the apostles.\" [Hebrews 13:8], [Mark 16:17], [John 14:12]\n\nL-114 He said, \"Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature. These signs shall follow them, in all the world, and to every creature. In My Name they shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. If they take up serpents, or drink deadly things, it wouldn't harm them. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" Now, that is His qualification. [Mark 16:15-18]\n\nL-115 See, we try to qualify something. We are trying to make, qualify the church to what we think God's Word is. We can't qualify to the church. We've got to qualify to God.\n\nL-116 I've always said, it's a great matching time. You paint your steps red, and watch your neighbor paint his red. Some of you women wear a certain kind of hat, at church, and watch the rest of the women get that.\n\nL-117 Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy had this here water-head haircut, and look all the women. She wore them little old sack-colored aprons, or things like that, it's a scandalous for the woman to be on the street, with them stretched on like that. Look at all the women doing the same thing. It's an impersonation, but that's in the world. The church people picked it up, and it's a shame that they do it. It's wrong for them to do it, and it's a disgrace. And when we see it creeping into Pentecost, it's more disgraceful. That is right. But, you see, the church puts up with it and lets it go.\n\nL-118 Now, we don't care. I never cared whether my coat matched my trousers, or my tie matched my coat. I want my experience to match God's Bible and His requirement. And that's what we as pentecostal people ought to do, is have our experience just like theirs was, because He's the same Jesus, the same Holy Ghost, the same power. He's a-living today, and He lives among us.\n\nL-119 It kind of reminds me of one day His mother had gone off from Jerusalem, from the worship, and his foster daddy, Joseph. And they went three-day's journey, and just presuming that He was along with them, and they found out that He wasn't there. [Luke 2:46]\n\nL-120 And, you know, I want to liken that today. You know, the church has had a three-stage journey. Luther, Wesley, pentecost; three-stage journey. God will give them a message, justification, Luther, he hung onto it; then come sanctification through Wesley; then the baptism of the Holy Spirit, with pentecost. And I wonder if we didn't get off all on a big tantrum somewhere, to build big things and do great things, like Balaam had in his mind; great organizations, the--the one to outrun the other, and this one more, giving gold medals and stars for Sunday school and who could bring in the most members, and take in just anything into the church.\n\nL-121 I tell you, there is one Church there is not a hypocrite in, that's the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, that's baptized by the Holy Ghost. You're not persuaded in There. You are borned in There. You're sent in there by the Holy Spirit.\n\nL-122 They found out. The parent found out that He wasn't among them. [Luke 2:44-45]\n\nL-123 Now in this hour, this great crisis is on, when we know that this nation is shaking. Not only the nation, but the world is shaking. It's at the end time. There is not another thing that I know to happen but the Rapture, the Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's all ready.\n\nL-124 And we see these gatherings. Oh, get every benefit, this convention coming up, get everything out of it you can get, that's of God. If you haven't got the Holy Ghost, just put it in your mind you're not going to leave here until you get It. That's the way to do it. Stay there, 'cause you... this is, might be your last opportunity. There may never be another convention on this West Coast. It may be beneath the sea, by that time, 'fore another one. So we don't know what could happen, so we... We're looking for the judgments of God to come upon the nations.\n\nL-125 Now may I say this. They thought He was along. But they found out, in the crisis, that He wasn't. See, He wasn't 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min with them.\n\nL-126 Now we find out, that in the time that when this great thing has been brought up, and we find out that we're missing something in our churches, and that is the power of Christ.\n\nL-127 Now, look, I don't want to criticize. I love you, and genuine, true love always is corrective. Now we're missing Christ in our church. We're missing Christ amongst our Pentecostal people, our brother and sisters. There is something wrong. The old-fashion prayer meetings they used to have, all day and night, they don't have them no more. Our women used to wear long hair; they don't do it anymore. It would be a disgrace for women to paint and use paint, back in the early days, and act the way these women do. Something went wrong. Nothing wrong with Christ, see, but something went wrong. Something is somewhere. The pulpit, used to, wouldn't have permitted such a thing as that, but it does now. See, the crisis is on, and we're missing something.\n\nL-128 We're missing power that we ought to have, where the big machine ought to be running up, and great signs and wonders. Well, this building ought to be sitting so full of power of God, now, till a sinner couldn't stay in here; the Holy Spirit condemning it, right quickly like that, like Ananias and Sapphira. And we're missing something.\n\nL-129 Now what happened? They went to look for Him, amongst their kinfolks, and they didn't find Him amongst their kinfolks. So where did they find Him? Right back where they left Him. [Luke 2:44-45], [Luke 2:46]\n\nL-130 And I think, when our church got on this great organizational spree that we had, one had to outdo the other, and had to have bigger churches, and better class of people, and better dressed people, and better singers, and stand up there and...\n\nL-131 I like good singing. I like real good old-fashion pentecostal singing. But I cannot stand that put-on stuff, it just simply don't go with me; hold your breath till you're blue in the face, just to be heard. I--I believe in singing from your heart, in the Spirit of God, like I heard in here a while ago. See?\n\nL-132 I like good old-fashion shouting, but I think shouting can go on just if the music is going on or not. The Spirit of God upon the people, It brings down the blessings and power of God. I believe man can testify, and sing and praise God, at their work, wherever they are. Truly.\n\nL-133 And now we're missing something. Where will we find Him? Right where we left Him, in the Word. Let us pray.\n\nL-134 Dear Heavenly Father, one of these nights we're going to close this Bible the last time, the last song is going to be sung, last sermon preached, the last prayer line will be called, the last sinner will come in. And then what? O dear God, we don't want Your permissive will, Father. Let us walk in Your perfect will. Let us just--just not take a Word here and there, and make It to fit a dogma or a creed, or something. Let us take the Word as It is, believing the full Gospel, all that Jesus taught for us to do. We do not believe that the acts of the apostles is just the framework. We believe It's the Word of God, It's the acts of Your Holy Spirit in the apostles. And we believe that the same Holy Spirit, Lord, that come upon them, and the way they acted, It'll do the same thing in us, when It comes upon us, if it's the same Spirit. [I Kings 8:61], [Hebrews 13:21]\n\nL-135 So I pray, dear God, that this convention that we're just on the eve of it, to start tomorrow night. I pray, Heavenly Father, that it'll be the greatest convention that this city has ever had, because of Your Presence. Bless each speaker, O God, may it be so--so shaking, may the wrath of God be thundered out across the pulpit. May sinners shake, tremble. May the Presence of Jesus Christ come so real to the people, that they can just close their eyes and see Him walking among them. Grant it, Lord.\n\nL-136 Now, tonight, just before this happens that we're praying for... Dear God, some of Your children are sick. They've been wounded, and--and they're hurt. I've come to pray for them. Will You honor what I ask You, tonight, Lord, for their sickness? I trust, to You, there won't be a feeble person in this building when the services is over.\n\nL-137 Your servants all through here, sitting out there, shouting, throwing up their hands, and back here on the platform, and saying \"amen\" to the Word. Father, we are one unit of people. We've come out of the world, out of those cold 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min formal conditions, and we've been borned of the Spirit. We're alive, tonight. And You said, because You live, we were alive also. And we are trusting, Lord, and believing with all of our heart, according to the Word, that we are represented in Thee. [John 14:19]\n\nL-138 Now make Thy Words real, tonight, to heal the sick, as I pray for them, and these others pray. Grant it, Lord, it'll be so. And we'll praise Thee for it. We ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-139 Now... [Someone begins to speak in another tongue. Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Thank You, Father God.\n\nL-140 We feel that, just like one time in the Bible, they was up against a crisis, and the Spirit of the Lord fell upon a man and He told him where to defeat the enemy, where to go. Listen to That. Just correct yourself. See, the Spirit of Life in you, corrects you to the Word. See, if the Word is living in you, It lives Itself right through the Word.\n\nL-141 Now, last night I was late. Now, you're such a fine people, I just... Looks like, and as I start getting older, I--I--I just wish I could... I will be with you forever, in another Land.\n\nL-142 So now we're going to pray for the sick, and now I'm not going to try to bring too many at a time, like I did last night. And now, Billy Paul give out a bunch of prayer cards, I suppose a hundred of them. Did you give a hundred, or two? Two hundred. What was they? C.\n\nL-143 Who has C, number one? Raise up your hand, let's see if that's right, now. Prayer card, look on your prayer card, it's got a number and a--and a letter on it. C, number one, raise up your hand. Way up. All right, come down here. Number two, three, four, five. Now, and, you, somebody get over here and catch them. Now we want every one of the prayer cards, but we want them lined over on this side. One, two, three, four, five. I see three of them. And your prayer card, sir? Four. Now there be another one? Five, is that the person coming there? One, two, three, four, five. C, number one, two, three, four, five. All right, now just come as you're called, your number.\n\nL-144 So, last night, I seen them down there, people crowding. We don't want that. This is a church, you know, not an arena. So, we--we, you have to keep order.\n\nL-145 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Now just line them up as they go back. Now, prayer card six, seven, eight, nine, ten. And somebody will hold up their hand when they got... when they're lined up up there. And we're going to pray for them.\n\nL-146 How many is going to believe with me now that the Lord Jesus is going to do a great work? I'll do all that I can. Now six, seven; six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.\n\nL-147 Now just come around, so they won't all be crowded at once, you know, and around it. That's what the numbers are given to you for, to keep you in order, you know. Keep so it will not be... Then as your number is called, well, you just come then. All right, and now we want to...\n\nL-148 Now I want all, everybody, to be real reverent now. And we'll pray on now for about, till we can get these people prayed for. And we don't know what the Lord might do. We don't know what He'll do. But we're expecting Him to do great things.\n\nL-149 Now, I believe, fifteen, have I got that many over there yet? Billy Paul, where you at? All right. Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.\n\nL-150 Now, see, they're already jamming up. So now I'm going to have, maybe, perhaps some brother to, as when them comes down to the end of the row, let him call the next numbers, you see, so we won't all have to stand, stand there so long when we're praying for--for the--the sick people. All right. Now we'll--we'll... I want--want you to...\n\nL-151 I want to speak to you while they're getting those people so they won't be jammed up together.\n\nL-152 Now, no one come until your--your number is called. We called up to fifteen, I believe it was, or twenty, something along there, I'll say up to twenty, and then let's wait. And that'll be enough in there right now, whatever is over there.\n\nL-153 And now how many cards is there? Raise up your hands. And how many doesn't have cards? Raise up your hands. 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min\n\nL-154 Now, remember, you don't have to have a prayer card. We've been here two nights, and each night the Holy Spirit has went out over the audience and healed the people, regardless of prayer cards. Is that right? The prayer card only does one thing to you, help you to get in line. That's right. But you have faith, and you watch the Holy Spirit leave the platform, right here, and go right out among them audience there. How many knows that to be true? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-155 Now, I--I believe, firmly believe, if there was any other church besides the Pentecostal church, that I would--could go with and believe to, I would be with it, if I thought there was anything better. And when you hear me say something about the organizations, and things like that, I'm not against the people. It's because...\n\nL-156 What if you seen a man that you loved, out in a boat floating right down towards the falls, and know that boat was going to sink with him, and you say, \"Well, I love him, but he--he's got his own ways\"? No, I couldn't do that. That's not in me. I'd scream, run out and grab him, shake him, jerk him in, or anything else, to get him out of there, see.\n\nL-157 And I know that that won't float the falls. That's right. It's got to come back to Christ, as certain as anything. It's got to come back to--to God. Now I--I...\n\nL-158 Everybody in here has been in my meetings before, is that right? Hold up your hands if you've been in the meetings. All right. There's not any...\n\nL-159 Is there any newcomers that never was in one of my meetings before? Hold your hands. Well, what do you... I never... Is this the first time you've been in one of my meetings? Raise your hands again. Well, I--I--I tell you, I...\n\nL-160 Maybe I better change this thing. [A brother says, \"Explain a little bit about your ministry. \"--Ed.] Well, I--I'd better.\n\nL-161 You, to you people that just come in, I--I'm going... It's going to take me just a little, few minutes longer. Let me explain, because you'll go away with the wrong impression, see.\n\nL-162 I believe in every act of God. But I do believe that the Bible promises us, in the last days, that there is to be, come again, the Church has got to get in the same order it was, that Jesus left it when it went away. See, it's the Bride, it's got to come back to that place. Now, we've come through the great works of God, through justification, sanctification, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, restoration of gifts. But in following the line of Abraham...\n\nL-163 Now, I'm uneducated, and so I have to use something like John the Baptist. He was uneducated, too. He went in the wilderness, about nine years old, and he never got an education. So his sermons were more based upon like nature, \"O you generation of snakes.\" See, that's the worse thing he seen, and the so slimey, and he called them priests \"snakes.\" He said, \"You generation of snakes, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Don't begin to say, 'We got this, and we belong to this.' God is able of these stones,\" that's what he seen on the river bank, \"to raise up children to Abraham. And, also, the ax,\" that's what he used in the wilderness, \"is laid to the root of the tree. And every tree that don't bring forth good fruit, is hewn down.\" That's the kind he burnt, and made firewood out of, you see. But the good trees... He--he just makes his sermons like that. [Matthew 3:7], [Matthew 3:10]\n\nL-164 So, in this, I want to--to say it in this manner. We're at the end time, the harvest time.\n\nL-165 Now, in Abraham's journey, he met God all along in different forms, and so forth, which we could take it and show it. Just, we are Abraham's Seed, if we're in Christ. And Isaac was really his--his lesser son; he was his son, sexually. But, spiritually, Christ was Abraham's Seed, his royal Seed, his faith.\n\nL-166 Now we find that his royal Seed is, travels the same journey, that's, Bride of Christ travels the same journey that Abraham did. And the last sign that Abraham seen, before the promised son came, was when God was manifested in a human body, and two Angels came down. [Genesis 18:2]\n\nL-167 Jesus said, in Saint Luke, the 17th chapter and the 30th verse, that, \"As it was in the days of Noah.\" He told about Noah's time. And said, \"As it was in the days of Sodom,\" see, His Coming, \"so will it be in the days when the Son of man is being revealed.\" Now, He never said \"the Son of God\" being revealed. \"The Son of man!\" [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-168 Now, Jesus came in three names. Son of man, which is a prophet; Son of God, which went through the Church 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min age; then Son of David. But in between the Son of God and Son of David, according to His Own Word, and according to Malachi 4 and many Scriptures, He's to return back into His Church, in physical form, in the people, in a... in human beings, in the way of being a prophet. See?\n\nL-169 And watch what this Man done when He came down to see Abraham. First thing, He told Abraham about his name being changed, because He didn't call him Abram, He called him Abraham. And when He did, why, we find out that--that He said, \"Where is thy wife, Sarah?\" S-a-r-a-h; not S-a-r-r-a. [Genesis 18:9]\n\nL-170 \"Why,\" he said, \"she is in the tent behind You.\"\n\nL-171 He said now, she was ninety and Abraham was a hundred, and He said, \"Now I'm going to visit you according to the promise, the time of life.\" [Genesis 21:5], [Genesis 18:10-13]\n\nL-172 And Sarah on the inside, heard Him, listening through the wall of the tent, and she laughed to herself. And the Angel, Man sitting there, said, discerned her spirit in the back, behind him, and said, \"Why did Sarah laugh, saying about these things?\"\n\nL-173 Well, they called Sarah forth, and she denied it. He said, \"But you did do it.\" She was a-scared. [Genesis 18:15]\n\nL-174 Now Jesus said, just before the Coming of the Son of God, or the Son of... the second Coming, that this age that we live through...\n\nL-175 He come as Son of man, a prophet, because that fulfills the Scripture. Moses said, \"The Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me.\" We all know that was Jesus. Don't we? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] So He had to come according to the Scripture, a prophet. He never called Himself the Son of God; He called Himself the Son of man. [Deuteronomy 18:15], [Acts 3:22], [Acts 7:37]\n\nL-176 But now He is, through the Church age now, He has been Son of God. In the Millennium He'll be Son of David, sitting on David's throne. But between this time, we find out by the Scriptures, He is to reveal Himself again as Son of man, a prophet.\n\nL-177 Cause, the Word of the Lord comes to prophets only, never to theologians. It is to prophets. And the Lord said He did nothing, in His unchanging Word we just talked about, until first He shows His prophets. And the end time, them seven seals that this Bible has sealed up, the sevenfold mysteries of all of Christ, has to be revealed first, and it can only be brought to a prophet. We've been looking for that, for years, and we believe that His Spirit is among us now, so we find. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-178 Now watch when Jesus come, watch what He did to prove Himself to be that Messiah, that Anointed One. One day, after He had received... The Father had came down and dwelt in Him, in the form of a dove coming down from Heaven, saying, \"This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am pleased to dwell in.\" [Matthew 3:16-17], [Mark 1:10-11], [Luke 3:22]\n\nL-179 That's the reason He said, \"I and My Father are One. My Father dwelleth in Me. It's not Me that doeth the works; it's My Father that dwelleth in Me.\" [John 10:30], [John 14:10]\n\nL-180 John bear record, seeing that Spirit of God, like a dove, descending. A Voice coming from It, saying, \"This is My beloved Son in Whom I'm pleased to dwell.\" See, and He dwelt in Him. [II Peter 1:17], [Matthew 3:17]\n\nL-181 Now watch when His ministry started, He had to act Son of man now. Now watch what He did. There come up a man by the name of Simon Peter. His name was Simon then, later called Peter. Andrew had been attending the meeting of John; and then when Jesus come, and John had introduced Him, he saw Him. And Andrew asked his brother, Simon, to come to the meeting with him.\n\nL-182 And he had been told by their father, as it said that, \"There would come a time, before the real Messiah would come, that there would be many false Messiahs raise up.\" There is always that way. He said, \"But, sons, remember, the real Messiah, you will know Him because He'll be according to the Scripture. He will be a prophet. Now, we haven't had a prophet for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years, since Malachi. But there'll be many people make claims, which we know there was--there was a Jesus raised up and carried out a bunch, and so forth. But this real 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min Messiah will be a prophet.\" And all Hebrews are taught to believe what the prophets says are the truth.\n\nL-183 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Right then that uneducated fisherman, who we're told didn't have enough education to write his name, the Bible said he was both \"ignorant and unlearned,\" he recognized that to be the Son of God. He recognized that to be the Messiah, because there was a prophet. There was the One Who told him who his name was, and told him what his father's name was. Then he knowed that had to be a prophet, 'cause the Man didn't know him. And he was given the keys to the Kingdom. [Acts 4:13], [Matthew 16:19]\n\nL-184 And we find there was some standing there listening at that, and one by the name of Philip, who had a... was having Bible studies with a friend, by the name of Nathanael, looking for the Messiah. So he runs around the mountain, about a day's journey, and comes back. And he finds this Nathanael over there under a--a fig tree, pray--praying. And he said, \"Come, see Who we found, Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph.\" So Nathanael being... or Philip or... [John 1:45]\n\nL-185 Nathanael, rather, being a good man, he said, \"Now, could any good thing come out of Nazareth?\" He said, \"Well,\" he said, \"just come and see.\" [John 1:46]\n\nL-186 Now, that's good advise. Come, see for yourself. Don't stay home and criticize. Come, find out. \"Search the Scriptures, in them you think you have Eternal Life.\" Jesus said, \"They are They that testify of Me.\" [John 5:39]\n\nL-187 So on the road back, no doubt, they had a little talk. He told him, said, \"You know that fisherman that couldn't sign that ticket for them fish you got that day? He told him. You know his father was up there in the church, his name was Jonas. You remember? So, He--He--He told him who he was.\" \"Oh, I'll have to see that.\"\n\nL-188 So when he walked up, and maybe he was in the prayer line, where Jesus was. I don't know. He had walked up in Jesus' Presence. Jesus looked at him, and said, \"Behold an Israelite, in whom there is no guile!\" [John 1:47]\n\nL-189 Now, the first place, you say, \"How did He know he was an Israelite? Well, because he was dressed?\" No, no.\n\nL-190 All Easterners wear those turbans. They dress alike. And said, \"An Israelite.\"\n\nL-191 And He said, \"There is no guile!\"He could have been a crook or anything, then he would have been exposed. He said, \"In which there is no guile!\"\n\nL-192 And so that kind of took the starch out of Nathanael, so he said, \"Rabbi, when did you ever know me? Why, I--I--I don't get this. When did You ever know me? I never met You. I just was brought up here by Philip. When did You ever know it?\" [John 1:48]\n\nL-193 He said, \"Before you were under the fig tree, while you were there praying, I saw you.\" Yeah. See?\n\nL-194 He said, \"Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God. Thou art the King of Israel.\" [John 1:49]\n\nL-195 Jesus said, \"Because I told you this, you believed? Then you'll see greater than this.\" [John 1:50]\n\nL-196 Now, there was those standing there. Now let me give you a little warning. There was those standing there, rabbis and priests, and they said, \"This Man does this by Beelzebub.\" [Matthew 12:24]\n\nL-197 And Jesus turned and said, \"I'll forgive you for that,\" for the atonement wasn't yet made, \"but someday the Holy Ghost will come and do the same thing,\" He said, \"and to speak one word against That, it'll never be forgiven you in this world nor the world to come.\" On to the woman at the well, the Samaritans. [Matthew 12:32]\n\nL-198 Now, there was three races of people on earth. We might be black, brown, yellow, whatever we are, but we come from one blood. And there is three races, which come from Ham, Shem, and Japheth's people; and that's Jew, Gentile, and Samaritan, half Jew and Gentile.\n\nL-199 Now, we Gentiles, Anglo-Saxon, we were heathen, worshiping idols. We wasn't looking for no Messiah.\n\nL-200 So when Jesus manifested Himself as Son of man... Now listen close, and I'll close. When Jesus came, He was duty bound to represent what the prophet said He would be, so there before Israel He represented Himself, before Peter 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min and Nathanael and those there, as Son of man.\n\nL-201 Now He has need go by Samaria. And He goes up to Samaria, and there He found a woman sitting at the well. We know the story, and as she, they talked together. She come to get water. He said, \"Bring Me a drink.\" [John 4:7]\n\nL-202 And she said, \"Now, there is segregation here, we can't have this. And I'm a woman of Samaria, and You're a Jew. We don't have...\" [John 4:9]\n\nL-203 He said, \"But if you knew Who you were talking to, you'd ask Me for a drink.\" [John 4:10]\n\nL-204 She said, \"Well, the well is deep, what You going to draw with?\" [John 4:11]\n\nL-205 And the conversation went on till He contacted her spirit. And when He contacted her spirit, He found what her trouble was. How many knows that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now how many of you newcomers knows that the truth? [\"Amen.\"] That's right, that was true. And what did He say? \"Go get your husband and come here.\" She said, \"I have no husband.\" [John 4:16-17]\n\nL-206 And He said, \"Thou hast said well. For you've had five husbands, and the one you're living with now is not your husband.\" She turned. [John 4:18]\n\nL-207 Now, she wasn't like them priests, said, \"He's got a devil. He's a fortuneteller or something.\"\n\nL-208 She turned, and she said, \"Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. Now, we haven't had one for four hundred years. The church hasn't been used to such as this. But we perceive, I perceive that You are a prophet. Now, I know that we're looking for the Messiah. And when the Messiah comes, that's the thing that He'll do.\" [John 4:19], [John 4:25]\n\nL-209 Now the Bible said, \"He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" If that was the anointed sign of Messiah back there, to the Samaritan and to the Jew, now, it never was done before Gentiles. Nowhere in the Bible did Jesus ever do it before Gentiles. They had four thousand years of looking for a Messiah; we've had two thousand years, with their training, also, to look for a Messiah. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-210 Now, if that was His identification just before their day was finished, it's got to be our identification, because He promised the Son of man would reveal Himself again in the day that the world become like Sodom again. And anybody knows we're there. See? [Luke 17:29-30]\n\nL-211 Now, I believe that Jesus Christ keeps every Word. All Scripture is inspired. I don't believe we have one right, and will be condemned for it, if we add one word to It or take one Word from It. Revelation 22 says so. I believe He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. [Revelation 22:19]\n\nL-212 I certainly honor the Lutheran for their stand in their day, the Methodist for sanctification in their day, and the Pentecostal for their stand in their day, but we're living in another day. We're living when there has been stalk, tassel, shuck, almost like the Wheat, but the Wheat is inside the shuck. The shuck has just supported the Wheat, kept the hot sun from burning It. And now the denomination is pulling away from It, so It can lay in the Presence of the Son, to get ripe. So we're--we're in... There won't be no more organizations rise up. This is the end of it. We've had, always about three years, when a message starts, they organize it.\n\nL-213 This has been going on for nearly twenty years, and no organization. It can't. We're in a Wheat time, a harvest time. I can hear the great combine coming. We're going Home one day. \"He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-214 Now, I am not He, but I am His servant. I do not believe that you lay hands on people and give them gifts. \"Gifts and callings are without repentance.\" They are predestinated, of God, to meet the age and the time of that age. Any Bible student knows that's the truth. Moses was born just in time. Jeremiah, in time, all the rest of them. John the Baptist, in time. Jesus was in time. And we're in time. This is what is supposed to happen. [Romans 11:29]\n\nL-215 Now, I claim that He is alive today, and His Spirit. After the church ages, we're in the Laodicean church age, the last call, and the worst of all of them, 'cause He was put out of the church. Remember, Son of man, and He was put out of the church; not an organization out of an organization, but a Person out of an organization. See? None of the other 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min church ages had that, just the Laodicea. If you are spiritual, you'll understand.\n\nL-216 Our Heavenly Father, now I have testified truly of You. Now if this be true, which I know it is, Lord, I believe it true, You testify that I've told the Truth. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-217 I'm going to ask something, just a moment. I wasn't going to have any discernments in the line, because I thought all of you had been in my ministry. But for these people that's here, let some of you people out there go to praying, and let just someone in the line, or something. And now if Jesus Christ will take this human being. It won't work without you. You're the one who does it.\n\nL-218 Now, listen, a woman touched His garment, one day, and He turned around, said, \"Who touched Me?\" [Mark 5:30], [Luke 8:45]\n\nL-219 They all said, \"Why, You seem...\" Or, Peter said, \"Why, the whole crowd is touching You.\" [Mark 5:31], [Luke 8:45]\n\nL-220 He said, \"But I perceive that I've gotten weak, or virtue has gone from Me.\" Virtue is \"strength.\" And said, \"I perceive that I have--I have gotten weak.\" [Luke 8:46]\n\nL-221 And so He looked around, upon the woman, until He found her, and told her about her blood issue. And that she... He said, \"Thy faith has saved thee.\" All right. [Mark 5:34], [Luke 8:48]\n\nL-222 Now, He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And the New Testament, the Book of Hebrews, said that, \"Right now He is the High Priest making intercessions for you, that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity.\" Now, here, is that--is that one of the patients here? Come. [Hebrews 13:8], [Hebrews 4:15]\n\nL-223 Now, for the audience. I do this not for a show, friends. Now stop thinking that. Remember, I get your thoughts. How many knows that's true, and sees it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-224 Here is a woman that I--I've never seen. I don't know one thing about the woman. We're probably born miles apart, and years apart, and here we stand here tonight. We're strangers to each other. I don't know you. Now, I have no idea. Here, here is--here is Saint John 4 again, a--a man meets a woman. Now, I'm not Jesus and she is not that woman. But here is just similar. And He said, \"The works that I do shall you do also.\" Now, I don't know. It takes this woman's faith to do it. I don't know nothing about her. But now if I have told that which is truth, then God is obligated to make the... say this is right. Now, not knowing you, if God of Heaven... [John 14:12]\n\nL-225 And I have told the Truth. Do you believe that what I said about that is the Truth? You accept that to be true? [The sister says, \"I believe it.\"--Ed.] You believe that? I wouldn't stand here before this Holy Bible and try to mislead someone, a man of my age, and know I've got to meet God yonder at the Judgment Bar. We've got to stand there, someday. We know that.\n\nL-226 Now if God can reveal, to me, something in your life, that you know that I don't know nothing about, 'cause I don't know you. If anything, it would have to be something in your life. I would know nothing about it. It would have to be come from a supernatural Power. And then it would be up to you, what you thought the Power was.\n\nL-227 And now to you newcomers. Now I hold my hand. Now, please don't walk around right now, 'cause, see, you're each a spirit. When I turn, you just feel like a--a pull from everywhere. See, you're--you're human beings and got spirits. And you are a spirit. If you're not, you're dead. So you just respect, just for a moment.\n\nL-228 And you man here, pray. I wasn't expecting this, never come for this tonight, at all. I come just to pray for the sick. But that's the newcomers.\n\nL-229 Now, do you believe that? If the Lord can tell me what your trouble is, or what you're here for, something you have done or ought to have done, or--or something else, then you will believe? All right, I'm trying to contact your spirit, you see. That's what I'm trying to do. Like He did the woman at the well, He talked to her a little bit, see, He was asking for a drink. And that's what I'm trying to do, is get your mind, not reading your mind; but trying to as He did, perceive your thoughts.\n\nL-230 You're here for a stomach condition. You got a stomach trouble. That's right. Raise your hand if that's true. Do 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min you believe now? Not only that, but you're hungering for something else. You want the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Wave your hand if that's true. See? I seen that Light move down on her, and then move back, see. Go and receive the Holy Ghost, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nL-231 Do you believe now, newcomer? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now you say...\n\nL-232 Now here, see, when that anointing once gets started, then here It goes. See, just as soon as the woman standing, there she is, she is right now... She recognizes there is Something around her.\n\nL-233 How many ever seen the picture of that Pillar of Fire, that Light there? At Washington D.C. See? Now I wish... It's another dimension, like. I'm looking right at It. There It hangs right here by the woman. I'm looking right at It.\n\nL-234 Now, I'm a total stranger to this woman. I don't know her. And I doubt very much whether she knows me, only just by being out in the meeting. That's all. But if God can tell me something about you, or something like just a while ago, would you believe me to be His prophet, His servant? You'd believe that with all your heart? Well, may He grant it. You are, you're facing an operation, and that operation is about your hand. There is no places on them, but it's a nerve condition in your hand. That was caused by an accident, and you're supposed to be operated on. You believe, and you won't have, to be operated on if you'll just believe with all your heart!...?...\n\nL-235 Just have faith now. Just don't doubt. Just believe. Now, here, let this one more woman, 'cause this woman is in a critical condition. You see that black shadow? How many ever seen the picture taken of the black shadow of death? It's hanging over the woman right now. If God don't help her, she can't live. She has a tumor. [The sister says, \"Yes!\"--Ed.] And the tumor is in the brain. [\"Yes!\"]\n\nL-236 Dear God, if You're present so close now, that knows all these things, I pray, Dear God, that You'll heal our sister. Let her live, Father, for Your glory. I ask in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-237 How do you do? You're a mighty nice person. If mother had lived, she would a-been about your age, I suppose. She is in Glory, tonight. She would always pray for me when I went to meeting. I said to the Lord... [The sister says, \"I'm eighty-five.\"--Ed.] Ma'am? [\"I'm eighty-five.\"] Eighty-five years old. Bless your heart, sister.\n\nL-238 Now, I am a total stranger to you, I suppose. We're years difference in our age. And I don't know you. I've never seen you. We're just two people met here on earth, but you are a Christian. You're a believer. Cause, the reason I know that, is the feeling of your spirit. You're, you've welcomed me, see. And I do believe it to be the Holy Spirit, 'cause it gives the works and actions of the Holy Spirit. See? And I know It's Him. I know this thing that we speak of is true. Now, I know it's the truth.\n\nL-239 Now, I don't know what would be wrong. But if the Lord Jesus would reveal to me what would be wrong with you, would... you would know whether it was right or not, or tell me something that you've done, or ought not have done. You'd believe it was that same Lord Jesus, same God that could tell Philip where he was, tell Simon what His name was? Do you believe Him to be the same One?\n\nL-240 Your trouble is a bowel trouble. [The sister says, \"Exact.\"] That's exact. Isn't that right? [\"Yes, sir.\"--Ed.] You believe me now to be His prophet? Your name is Mrs. Bayer, Mrs. Bayer; Bayer, like Bayer aspirin. That's right. You're healed. Go on, Jesus Christ make you well. God bless you.\n\nL-241 You believe with all your heart? Now if you just have faith, don't doubt!\n\nL-242 Now, you're really not here for yourself. You're here for somebody else. It's a man, and he's not here, a brother. That brother is in a mental institution. Take that handkerchief you got in your hand, while the Spirit is on you, send it to him. Put it on him, don't doubt, he'll come out of the institution and be well. Do you believe it? God bless you.\n\nL-243 You say that, \"You said, 'That Angel, in the last day there, He had His back turned.' Well, you look.\"\n\nL-244 I won't look at this woman. I turn my back. Now, lady, the one with the patient, can you hear me, say \"yes.\" [The sister says, \"Yes.\"--Ed.] If the Lord Jesus will reveal to me what's your trouble, when I'm looking this way, you'll know whether it's the truth or not. Is that right? Do you believe then it's to fulfill what Jesus said, \"It would be done in the last days, as it was in the days of Sodom\"? Will you believe it? You have a lady's disorder, a female trouble. Believe with 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min all your heart now, it'll leave and you can go home and be well. God bless you. \"If thou canst believe!\"\n\nL-245 Do you believe God will heal that heart trouble? Well, just keep on walking, saying, \"Thank You, Lord!\" Believe!\n\nL-246 Get up of a morning, you can hardly move. Arthritis is a bad thing, but Jesus Christ is the Healer of arthritis. Do you believe that? You step off of a curb, sideways, going down. I see you doing that. You won't have to do that no more, if you'll believe. Do you believe that I was sent for this purpose? [The sister says, \"I do.\"--Ed.] Then, in the Name of Jesus Christ, may it leave her. Amen.\n\nL-247 You got stomach trouble. Do you believe God will let you go home, eat your supper, feel good about it? Go on your road, eat your supper, believe and you'll feel fine.\n\nL-248 You have a weakness comes over you, that's right, because your heart is bad. That's right. You don't have it no more now. Go, believe it.\n\nL-249 What if I didn't say one word to you, and just laid hands on you, would you believe me, too, that you'd get well? Come here.\n\nL-250 Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You'll heal the woman and make her well, through Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-251 How many people here believe, how many of you newcomers, all you people?\n\nL-252 Just think, and I can't hardly see the people coming now. Just remember, one vision caused the Lord Jesus to get weak. How many knows that? One woman touched Him. Daniel saw a vision and was troubled at his mind, his head, for several days. How many knows that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] See? All right. [Luke 8:44-50], [Mark 5:25-34], [Daniel 7:15]\n\nL-253 Now how many of you people believe that, that this is the Holy Spirit? Do you believe it with all your... Not me, now. The Holy Spirit! Now here is man sitting here that believe that, too.\n\nL-254 Now some, now some more of you people that's got them prayer cards, I want everybody that is going to be in this prayer line, stand up to your feet, just a moment.\n\nL-255 Look, I want to ask you a solemn question. Have you confessed all your sins that is there? You believe? Have you confessed, and you--you believe that you're going to be healed? You've confessed all your sins and made all the wrongs right? Raise up your hands, if you have, before God, you believe that. [James 5:16], [I John 1:9]\n\nL-256 And now with your hands up, also, do you believe it takes the Holy Spirit, and this is the Holy Spirit that's just a vindicating Himself among you? You believe that with all your heart? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] You do? Then every one of you can be healed.\n\nL-257 Now do you have faith and confidence in these ministers sitting here? Do you believe them man, too? How about let's pray for you, each one, and then let you come by and lay hands on you.\n\nL-258 This makes me so weak. That just go on like that, it just--it just gets me.\n\nL-259 And I--I'm going to South Africa after this. For, oh, my, you know how it is down there where you can't even talk to the people. And there'd be... We're at least expecting three hundred thousand, one single meeting.\n\nL-260 So you just believe! You're here in America, you've seen It in and out.\n\nL-261 Dear God, these people are needy. And I don't know nothing else that You could do, Father, to prove to them by Your Word, that You're the unchanging God. I believe that we have seen so many great things, Lord, and ate from Your table, with such dainty, wonderful Eternal Food of Life, till we've become... and become too accustomed to It. It--it becomes a common thing. We're not, we don't approach It right, Lord, when we see. Even I think of myself standing here, I should be on my knees, knowing that right here that Spirit that raised Him up from the dead is standing right here. The Spirit was on Him when He was living here on earth, is right here now. And we, poor unworthy sinners, through His grace and mercy, He bought our lives. And here we are, today, carrying on His work, as He said that we would carry on His work. \"The works that I do shall you do also.\" Promising these things and proving them, here in 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min this world! Lord, I am so grateful to You, that I could be counted a part of the people of Yours, in this last day. [John 14:12]\n\nL-262 Dear God, these people are standing. They're sick, Father. I have no way of healing them. And neither do You now, You've already healed them. You were wounded for our transgressions, with Your stripes we were healed. So, Father, I pray that each one of them passing through here, when we're going to pray for them, that they'll come like they were now walking under the cross. For they know, beyond a shadow of doubt, the a-vindicated Holy Spirit is here on the platform. The Christ of God is right in the meeting. Forgive every sin. Take away every unbelief. And may each of them be healed as they pass through this line. In the Name of Jesus Christ, I ask it. Amen. [Isaiah 53:5]\n\nL-263 [A brother says, \"Brother Branham, if we can have everyone sit, and take one section at a time, that way then they won't crowd.\"--Ed.] Yeah. All right.\n\nL-264 Now I want to ask something. Will you, my brethren, stand here with me?\n\nL-265 You see, here is one thing about it. Many evangelists goes into a city, and they do all the praying for the sick, and all the rest of it. And when the congregation, when it's gone, the--the--the people is only built around the evangelist, see. That isn't so, people. These man, I doubt anyone in this age... I know it, there is a lot of impersonation, but I won't say what I was going to. But these man might not do that, that's true, and I very much doubt it.\n\nL-266 But they're just as ordained of God, to lay hands on the sick, as I or anybody else. God is just as much to answer their prayer, as He would be to any prayer there is. Jesus has commissioned, \"These signs,\" didn't say will follow William Branham, Oral Roberts, so forth, \"it'll follow them that believe.\" And these man are filled with God's Spirit. They are baptized people, with the same Holy Spirit. That Spirit was here doing that work just a few moments ago, He is still here. He is on each one of these man, see, and they're all filled with It. So I'm going to ask them to make a double line along here, on the sides of this row here, if they will, so that they can lay their hands upon the sick, too, as they pass through. [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-267 And they want those who have prayer cards to stand, prayer cards only, to stand out in the aisle. And the rest of you pray, just a few minutes now. Stand, on each section, just stand right out to your left of your section. Stand out, to your section, and then they'll just call you. When you see this line up here ending, let this line walk right into it. When this line ends, let this one walk into it.\n\nL-268 And when you come by now, remember, you'll just be taking a walk unless you're believing. How many of you know, you just feel in your heart, that you've prayed through about this, and you're going to be healed as soon as you pass through this line? Raise up your hand, say, \"I accept it, Christ, right now, just because You commissioned these things.\"\n\nL-269 Now I pray for every one of you. We're going to pray. I'm going to ask Sister Rose or ever who is at the organ over there, Sister Rose, will you please play, The Great Physician Now Is Near, for us. And let the people, all the other people, be in prayer. And as they pass through this prayer line, I believe every one is going to be healed. God bless you. The rest of you now keep your head down, and be praying for others.\n\nL-270 Be real sincere. See, that's how that little Baptist preacher got the Holy Ghost, the other night. He was thinking about it, just sitting there, real sincere, and It fell upon the whole group of them. You got to be sincere with God.\n\nL-271 Now He's proved He's here with you. He is here. 'Now when anybody tells you that this is just a bunch of excitement, you know better now, don't you, you newcomers? He vindicated Himself, it's Him. And no one else could do that. This hasn't been done for since the days of the apostles. It's just now come back to the church, as was promised. The Lord bless you now.\n\nL-272 Now, you people, as you pass through this line, come, praying. Everybody now, \"The--the great Physician now is near, the sympathizing Jesus.\" Now when you come, come with your heads down, in reverence. Pass by. These men lay hands on you, you'll be healed. \"... -est note in seraph...\" ...?... That's all right. It's all right.\n\nL-273 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] But, just a simple thing of obeying what God said do. I've seen it happen so many times. 65-0427, Does God Change His Mind?, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 88 min See, the Scripture didn't even command us to pray for the people, It just said, \"Lay hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" [Mark 16:18]\n\nL-274 Just recently, oh, it's... I don't say recently. The case was in my mind now. It's been about three or four years ago, or more. We was right here in California. Two women came by there, one of them had a--a--a growth on her face, and the other one had a stomach trouble. And they believed it just so. I layed hands upon them, and said, \"Now, I do this in the Name of the Lord Jesus.\"\n\nL-275 It was almost a month later. That lady was trying to eat, with that stomach trouble, she just couldn't do it. One morning, \"a real cool feeling went over\" her, she said, and she went to eat. And she run down to tell her neighbor, and her neighbor was shaking the sheets, like that, trying to find the growth that had left her face that night.\n\nL-276 See, just believe, friends. If He does that for one, He'll do it for all. And it's just a simple thing of laying on of hands. And that's what He said do. We don't know how it works. I don't know how it works. It's just His promise. He said it would do it. And I've found tens of thousands, around the world, they just get well. God promised to do it, and it's His promise. See, we just believe that. [Mark 16:18]\n\nL-277 Now, we're all coming over here. And you that couldn't get up, move right up close, and we're coming over to pray for you. Now I want each one of you man to go right along here, laying your hands in here, if you will, right along there. And I want to stand here and pray, and then come lay my hands on them, too. All right, get right in here. You all move right up close, so everybody can reach now.\n\nL-278 Dear God, in Jesus Christ's Name, we're praying for these people, some of them are afflicted, crippled. There them hands of those ministers, Lord, are going back and forth from one to the other. I pray that You'll heal each one of them, Lord. Let the Holy Ghost come upon them people, each of them, Father. And may the great Power of God overshadow them just now, and may they go home and be well. Knowing this, that Jesus said, \"If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" You promised it, Dear God. We are believing it. We are believing it, because You said so and we know that it's so, so shall these people be well. In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I bless them all. Amen. [Mark 16:18]\n\nL-279 God bless you. [Brother Branham and ministers lay hands on the sick and pray for the people. Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]\n\nL-280 My heart accepts healing for every one of you. I believe that. Will you believe it with me, each one of you now? That's all. I told you the truth, just as far as I know it. I love you, and God bless you. And I--I believe, with all my heart, you're going to be well. And may my blessings be with each one of you now. May God watch over you and protect you. You're in my prayers. Will you pray for me while I'm in Africa like that? I--I love you. And I'll see you tomorrow night. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

And now we're happy to be here this morning, and hear all these fine testimonies from these fine people, and now we trust that God will continue to be with us and bless us.\n\nL-2 Now, tonight, I understand that I'm to speak tonight, the Lord willing. And I asked Brother Shakarian, just a few moments ago, I said, \"Now, don't feel embarrassed. I know we have to get out of here at eleven o'clock and I--I just lose all sense of time when I get up here.\"\n\nL-3 It looks like all the rest of us do. We feel... They say, \"Two minutes, three minutes, or...\" Brother Smith, you know, that's hard to do in two or three minutes. And I know how it is, and I feel sorry for each one. But we're in a time age, where we are. We're going to Eternity, but we're now in time.\n\nL-4 And I said, \"Brother Demos, just a little before time, don't feel embarrassed, just pull me on the coat and I'll know that's time to stop.\" Now, if I don't get finished, I'll finish tonight. So if I do, well, I have a new text for tonight.\n\nL-5 Now just before we open the Book, let us speak to the Author, with our heads bowed.\n\nL-6 Dear Heavenly Father, we thank Thee this morning for this gathering, for what we've already heard. If we should just pass the benediction now, Lord, we would feel that it had been good to be here. So I pray that You'll continue, if it's good in Your sight, and continue to be with us and help us. And now we gather ourselves around the Word. As we have gathered around the fellowship of each other, hearing the testimonies of what You have done for us, now let us go back in the Word and find where all this comes from. Then, that will be a confirmation of what we're feeling and seeing, taking place today. Grant these things in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-7 Now, as--as His servant, I--I'm obligated to a Message. And I sometimes have been very much misunderstood, in times past, and perhaps will always. But I don't say things sometimes to be--to be different, I say them to be honest. And I like to say what I think is right. Everybody has a--a right to those things, to express his own opinion. That's why I'm among you.\n\nL-8 And Brother Shakarian, speaking about the prayer cards in the prayer lines, of seeing what the Holy Spirit... Now, he didn't say that about me. That's about the Holy Spirit, because I couldn't do those things. Anyone knows, that I couldn't do. But--but that's the minor side, what you see here. You should be out in other place, and watch how He foretells things! And I... things that will happen, it's, these are just... you, you're the one who does that. You're the one who believes God.\n\nL-9 And--and then if you don't believe God, remember, He tells you so, right here at the platform. And if you're in sin, He tells you so. And the things that you've done, and ought not have done, He tells you so. It just isn't only what they put on the prayer card. They could put on their prayer card... They wouldn't say, on there, they was a \"sinner,\" and this woman was \"living with the wrong husband,\" or so forth. And they won't put that on a prayer card, but the Holy Spirit gets that anyhow, see. See? And so it's then in now (how) the--the supernatural part, friends.\n\nL-10 And I say this honorably. Cause, there is not many of us here this morning, just a small group. It amazes me, till it makes me so nervous, I just feel like screaming sometimes. And when I sit down to a spot, on the mountainside, where I spend a great deal of time there, receiving from God, come down and give out to the people what He gave to me. And I--I don't want to be different from people. But yet, to be honest, I've got to be honest with God, see, to--to a Message.\n\nL-11 And now we're, the Lord willing, we're fixing to leave right away for an overseas tour, just in a few days, and if that be the will of the Lord. I certainly solicit your prayers.\n\nL-12 You're so nice! I get to talking, I just forget all about time, like the rest of us. But to Brother Shakarian, these fine ministers here at the platform, and out there, all you friends to Jesus Christ, I salute you in His Name; as a--a fellow kinsman with you, by the cross, to God, being brothers and sisters. 65-0429B, The Seed Shall Not Be Heir With The Shuck, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 62 min\n\nL-13 I want to turn, this morning, in the Scripture, over in the Book of Galatians, the Lord willing. I wish to read a Scripture.\n\nL-14 Now, last night, hearing the message that went forth from our ministering brother here at the platform, he spoke in tongues. Bredesen, Brother Bredesen, a very fine man. I...\n\nL-15 To see this with my illiteracy and education, my lack of understanding by words, and then knowing the Message to be true, and see such man as was on that panel the other night, standing there, and that can meet that intellectual type. They might not be able to do what the Lord has called me to do. I can't do what the Lord has called them to do. But us working together, I'm sure we can get the Message over, if we'll just stay before God.\n\nL-16 And when he gave a--a testimony here last night. And the Holy Spirit spoke in tongues, and, someone out in the audience, I always know to reverence that. Cause, I understand, by the Bible, that's the Spirit of God bringing something to us. And he said, spoke of the latter rain, former rain and latter rain. And that brings me to a thought.\n\nL-17 That Brother Bonham had just give me a little package with some checks on it, said, \"This is a love offering for the... from the people.\" Now, he--he, they should not have done that. See, I didn't come here for that purpose. But I... he, they give it to me, and, of course, there would be... there is no way of giving it back. And I'm going to take it, if the Lord willing, and try to put it on my expenses, going overseas. Because, I'm not sponsored, no means, where I'm going.\n\nL-18 It's kind of a secret, because the churches won't let me in. And I'm going in as a hunter, because it's on my Lord. The Lord has put it on my heart to do it, and I have to go in kind of under disguisement. See? So they have a little funny ideas there, that each one wants me to sign a card, that I'll agree with them on what they believe, and say this other group is wrong, and this group says they'll bring me in if I'll say this group is wrong. See? But I don't like that. See, we are...\n\nL-19 I've always tried to stand between the people, outside of the organizations and their differences, and call to what it seemed like the Spirit of God was saying through the brethren here this morning, that we are not a denomination. We are children of a family. Now, there is not no Branham denomination. There is a Branham family, and we all don't join that family, we're born in that family. And so, I, that's what I'm trying to represent, the--the best that I know how.\n\nL-20 Now in Galatians 4:27-31, I believe I have marked down here, I'd like to read this for a text. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate has... more children than she that has an husband. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of the promise. But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so is it now. Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondswoman and her son: for the son of the bondswoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman. So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondswoman, but of the free.[Galatians 4:27-31] May the Lord add His blessings now to His precious Word.\n\nL-21 I have a few, last night jotting down a few things; and it used to be, when I just had one meeting a week, somewhere, I--I could remember those Scriptures just as plain in my mind. But now after I... Now, as I say a little jokey way, I don't mean to be joking here at this platform. But after passing twenty-five, the second time, I don't remember like I used to. There is a lot of... There is a lot of miles on this old ford, and so I don't remember it. But as long as I can move, I want to give every move to the glory of Him Who saved me.\n\nL-22 Now I, seeing then this morning, watching.... Maybe this seems strange, and maybe to an intellectual mind it might be altogether mixed up, but it's complimentary to the thing that I'm called for. Even every little thing is a sign to me. I watch It, see how It moves. That's how I get my message sometime, is to watch and see the way the Spirit moves, and see what this one says, that one says.\n\nL-23 And you've noticed me, many times, before a healing service, standing there on the platform, or sitting back, 65-0429B, The Seed Shall Not Be Heir With The Shuck, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 62 min watching. I'm feeling the Spirit, the way It's a moving, and already know what's the matter with that person sitting there. See? See it over, over here, see, you catch It even before you go to the platform.\n\nL-24 Sometimes before I come to the meeting, sometimes, before even coming over here like to California, I've set down with those who with me, say, \"There will be a certain thing happen, this will take place here, and this will be down here, it'll go over this way,\" see, because it's in the Spirit of God. He is the... He knowed all things from the beginning, see, and so He is the Eternal One.\n\nL-25 And then noticing, this morning, Brother Jewel Rose, a very precious friend and brother to all of us, how that he got up and read that Psalms. Look how that dovetailed in, like he said, \"I want to see what kind of a seed that's hanging on you.\" Last night, the Spirit spoke and said, and about, \"The latter rain, former and latter rain, both being poured out in the last days.\" And this morning, \"The seed that's hanging on you.\" See, the Spirit speaking, watch how It did through these ministers, and so forth, this morning. So therefore I'm taking this subject: The Seed Shall Not Be Heir With The Shuck.\n\nL-26 That's a very strange text, but, The Seed Shall Not Be Heir With The Shuck. And from taking, drawing my conclusions of this, or my text, rather, from Galatians 4:27, three, Paul here of course is speaking of the literal seed of Abraham's two sons. Now, this, I want to use this so that you'll be sure not to miss it. And if I go over time, I'll pick it up tonight. And I want to teach, just like a Sunday school lesson, so that you'll, I believe, will have a better understanding.\n\nL-27 Now, and some of you men who are--are more capable of doing this than I am, why... I'm not a theologian, by no means. And so if you disagree with me on This, just feel like I did last night when some dear sister here baked me a cherry pie. Sitting on my--my... in my hotel room this morning, I--I hit a seed, but I'm still eating pie. I just laid the seed out, you see. So, that's, what you don't believe about It, just lay aside, see, and just continue eat what you think is right.\n\nL-28 Now, Paul is speaking of Abraham's two sons, which, one of them was by Sarah and the other was by Hagar. Now we find out here, and we understand that through the Scriptures, that God is represented never in two's. It's in three's. Always in three, God is perfected. [Genesis 16:1-8], [Genesis 21:1-5]\n\nL-29 The mathematics of the Bible runs perfect. God is perfected in three's, worshiped in seven's, and so forth. See, so we--we find that the mathematics of the Bible never fails.\n\nL-30 And we got here two sons of Abraham, and yet we can only be heirs as long as we are one of those sons, or some son of Abraham. \"For we being dead in Christ, then we become Abraham's seeds, and are heirs with Him according to the promise,\" therefore Abraham must have another Son. [Romans 4:13-14]\n\nL-31 Now, we know that his first son was by Hagar, and we find out his second son was by--was by Sarah. But he had a third Son, which was Jesus. Now, that may seem strange, but that's what we're going to try to break down. As I said, God represents Himself, always in perfection, in three's. And I've made myself clear before all now, and especially to your theolo-... theologians, that these things are just the way I see It, the way It comes to me. [Romans 4:13-14]\n\nL-32 Like in the beginning, God, God dwelt alone, because He was the Eternal One, see, wasn't even God. God is an \"object of worship.\" And the Logos, as we call It, the Word that went out of God, That, anyone knows that That was the Angel of the Lord, or the Word of the Lord, that followed the Israelites through the wilderness; the Angel of the Covenant, the Logos that went out of God. And then that Logos was made flesh and dwelt among us. Now we're in Saint John 1, \"In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" And now, as He gave His life for us, then His Spirit comes back upon us. Jesus said, \"At that day you'll know that I'm in the Father, the Father in Me; I in you, and you in Me.\" [John 1:1], [John 14:20]\n\nL-33 See, It's God, all along, God manifesting Himself, working Himself through different ages. So those three, of, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, same God working in three attributes. And we today are one, the Church Itself, an attribute of God's thinking before the foundation of the world, to have a--a Church. So those which are in Christ was in Christ at the beginning, that was His thoughts, and His thoughts is His attributes. 65-0429B, The Seed Shall Not Be Heir With The Shuck, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 62 min\n\nL-34 Here the seed starts, in the promise. And Abraham here slightly doubted, by Ishmael. And I want to show you the three stages of these, of this Seed that we're going to speak of, which is not heir with the shuck. Now we find that, in the beginning here, that God gave Abraham the promise. [Genesis 12:2-3]\n\nL-35 He gave Adam the promise, first. And that was, or, the covenant was on conditions. \"If you won't do this. If you will do This.\" [Genesis 2:16-17]\n\nL-36 But when He gave it to Abraham, it was unconditional, \"I have already done it.\" He never... What He did, it was unconditional, He gave to Abraham. Now, and through that, Abraham having the promise, therefore we have to be Abraham's Seed. \"It was not only to Abraham, but to his Seed after him.\" Now if you'll notice, it wasn't \"seeds\" after him, but \"Seed\" after him. [Genesis 17:19]\n\nL-37 Now we find out that the promise, being slightly doubted by Sarah, and Sarah told Abraham to take this Hagar, the Egyptian, young woman, for wife, and that would be the way that God would raise up this promised seed. [Genesis 16:2]\n\nL-38 Now, you see, from as I said last night, any move from that original plan of God throws the whole thing out of cater. We can't move from that original Word. It's got... We talked on it last evening, or evening before last, rather, on Balaam. He got God's answer, straight and clear, \"Don't go!\" But He has a permissive will. And you can work in that if you wish to, and God will make it honoring, but still it's not God's perfect will. And that's what we should strive for, His perfect will, not His permissive will. The Kingdom of God, which He... is in the earth today, will... can never be set up, justly, on a permissive will. It's got to come back to His perfect will. [Numbers 22:12-22]\n\nL-39 Now we see here that Sarah, after God had told Abraham that the child would be born through Sarah, that would bless the world, now Sarah doubted it. And I want you to notice, it never come by Abraham; but by Sarah, the female. And she doubted it, and she said, \"Take Hagar.\" And Abraham didn't want to do that, but God told him to go ahead and do it anyhow. So he did it, slightly doubted. Now, Isaac, being the free and from the promised woman, could not be heir with Ishmael, the bondswoman, in doubt. [Galatians 4:28-31]\n\nL-40 That's what Paul was trying to say here. See, where one thing is doubted, and it brings down a certain thing of God, a certain order of God, but it won't be heir with the original order of God. You understand? See, it can't be heir.\n\nL-41 Now that's why I am so strongly today. And I thought this would be a good time, because I don't know how much longer we'll be together, and, maybe I could, someway God would help me to show you the reason that I so firmly denounce organized religion. See? See, it cannot be heir with the original program of God, because organization is not of God. It's of man. The first church was ever organized, in all the world, was the Roman Catholic church at Nicaea, Rome. Revelation 17, said, \"She was a whore, and all of her children were harlots.\" And a whore is a woman who doesn't live true to her husband, and a harlot is the same thing. But, you see, it became a church, anyhow. It's an organized system and it separates brotherhood. We tried to organize all the churches together. It won't work; never did work. It won't (never) work. The World Council of Churches, they're just... they're out of the program of God. [Revelation 17:5]\n\nL-42 Now you say, \"Who are you, a fellow standing up there without even a grammar school education?\" That don't make any difference, what the education is. It's not my education I'm trying to talk about.\n\nL-43 It's the Word of God I'm speaking about, see. And these vindications that you see in the ministry, it isn't me, it's God trying to get that to you, that it's the Truth. Would God have anything to do with a lie? Then far be it from me, serving a God that would bless a lie. It's the Truth that He blesses, the Truth that He honored.\n\nL-44 Now, Ishmael could not be heir with Isaac, because one was slightly doubted, just slightly doubted. It was a child, it was still the seed of Abraham, but not God's perfect way for it; Ishmael. Now I could spend much time here, but I'm hoping the Holy Spirit will convey this to you in the real way that it should be. Now if they... [Galatians 4:22-31], [Genesis 21:10-12]\n\nL-45 If Ishmael and Isaac could not be heir together because the original plan of God was substituted into a--a permissive plan of God, a permissive way that God did bless, neither can the spiritual Church today be heir with the denominational. The denominationals, God blessed them, like He did Ishmael, but the Spiritual will not be heir with 65-0429B, The Seed Shall Not Be Heir With The Shuck, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 62 min the others. That's right. There will be, coming out of the church denomination (church so-called, church natural), will come a Bride of Christ, the Elected. [Galatians 4:22-31], [Genesis 21:10-12]\n\nL-46 Now there, what troubles me at this hour, is knowing that we see all these denominations pulling into this what we know to be the... what you call the latter rain, or, the pouring out of the Spirit. Do you realize that Jesus said, that, \"When that come to pass, it would be the end\"? When, the foolish virgin and the wise virgin was not heirs together. For when... The foolish virgin, she was a virgin, just lacking Oil. But when she come to buy Oil, it was at that time that the Bridegroom came. And she was left out, while she was trying to buy Oil. Do you understand? I want that to soak in, real good. Now, surely I won't have to move that subject any further. Now, neither can the Spiritual and the natural be heirs together. [Matthew 25:1-12]\n\nL-47 That's why the Rapture, the Bride, the wise virgin, the called-out, the foreordained, the elected! Why, you business man wouldn't run your office like some people try to think that God runs His program, haphazard. God knew, before the foundation of the world, who would be saved and who would not be saved. By predestination, by foreknowledge, He saw every member, put every name on the Lamb's Book of Life, before the Church ever began. Jesus come to seek and save that which was on that Book. He bought the Book of Redemption. It was lost, and He redeemed us, and all names was on that Book was redeemed when He redeemed us. [Ephesians 1:4-5]\n\nL-48 Then, as I have said many times, you recognize that. That's why you're here this morning, why you're coming up out of all these organizations and things. You're... There is Something pulling you. As my little thought was, about the eagle hatched under the hen, see, you--you realize there is something different. The--the church didn't have a--a satisfying something. But, you, you heard something else that was a scream, you realized that, that you were born for That. You're a part of It. You, you fit into It, like a glove on a hand. And that's why we're assembled here together this morning, is because, as my old southern mama used to say, \"birds of a feather flock together,\" because you have things in common.\n\nL-49 Buzzards and doves has nothing in common. Their diet is different, although a dove could be hatched under a buzzard. That's right. Depends on what it was, to begin with. Now, and in that, though, the--the dove might have to be mothered awhile by that, by that buzzard, but finally he'll find his mate.\n\nL-50 That's what the Church is doing today, for Jesus is the Word and He is the Bridegroom, and the Bride is a part of the Groom. Therefore the Word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the Word that was fulfilled in His day, and it's the same Word, same experience, same Life.\n\nL-51 For, when God separated Adam, he was both. We find out, Adam was spirit, to begin with. \"He made man in His Own image, created He male and female.\" And then, Genesis 2 and on, He created man in... out of the dust of the earth. Man was created in God's image (God is a Spirit), so he's a spirit man. Then when he become flesh man, animal flesh on the earth, He is--He is showing, portraying here the Bride. He never taken and made another being, but He took part of Adam, the original creation, took from him, a rib from his side; and took the feminish spirit out of Adam, left the masculine spirit in there, and placed it in the feminish part. Therefore, part of his spirit, part of his body; flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone; Word of His Word, Life of His Life, and that's the way the Bride is to Christ! [Genesis 1:26-27], [Genesis 2:21-25]\n\nL-52 That's why the Rapture of the royal Seed has to come first. And the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years, then they were brought up at the White Throne Judgment. See, there is no judgment to the royal Seed, or the predestinated Seed of Abraham. Now if you'll take Saint John 5:24, listen to this, \"He that heareth My Word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life.\" , [Genesis 1:27], [Genesis 2:7], [John 5:24]\n\nL-53 Now how would that be so much different from many of our theologies? Now I could walk out here and say to a drunkard, \"Do you believe?\" \"Sure!\" A man with another man's wife, \"Do you believe?\" \"Sure!\" \"Did you sit in the meeting last night, to hear the Word?\" \"Sure!\" \"You believe It?\" \"Sure!\" He is just saying that.\n\nL-54 But the original interpretation of this Word, \"he that understandeth My Word, and will believe on Him that sent Me.\" \"He that understandeth,\" that is, who It's made known to. [John 5:24] 65-0429B, The Seed Shall Not Be Heir With The Shuck, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 62 min\n\nL-55 Jesus said, \"No man can come to Me except My Father has drawed him. And all that My Father hath given Me, they will come. My sheep, My doves, hear My Voice. A stranger they will not follow.\" And what is the Voice of God? Is the Word of God. What's any man's voice but his word? It's the Word of God; they'll hear the Word of God. [John 6:65]\n\nL-56 The natural seed therefore was only a carrier, through Ishmael first, Isaac second, then on down to the Seed. Just like the stalk, tassel, and shuck, of the corn. Now, here, the three stages of the seed shows us the true picture that I want you to notice with me this morning. We are seeing here.\n\nL-57 And as being uneducated, I have to take the natural things that I see, to type the spiritual things that's made known to me, because I couldn't make it sensible to you in any grammar.\n\nL-58 And, anyhow, God always types the spiritual by the natural. If there wasn't a Bible, I'd still know that Christianity was right, because the whole earth turns upon death, burial, and resurrection. Nature works death, burial, and resurrection. [John 5:28-29]\n\nL-59 Look at the sap out of the tree, how it's brought the leaf, and the fruit, falls; goes back into the earth for the cold winter, down beneath the sod; comes up again in spring, with new life. Each year, testifying that there is a life, there is a death, there is a resurrection.\n\nL-60 The sun rises of a morning, a little baby just born, very weak. At seven or eight o'clock, it starts off to school. At ten or eleven o'clock, it's out of college. It's shining in its strength, from about eleven till about three, then it begins to weaken. In the evening it goes down, gets weak, an old man. Is that the end of it, it dies? No. It rises again the next morning. See?\n\nL-61 All nature, your real true Bible that witnesses with this Bible! And that's what I'm trying to show you this morning now, through nature you'll see the Word of God, patterned to the--the Word of God, because nature is the formation of God.\n\nL-62 Like science, they find the mechanics and the laws of nature, but they don't know what that nature is. They don't know the Life of nature. That's God. So, the mechanics without the dynamics is no good.\n\nL-63 Now, the stalk, tassel, and shuck, notice. Hagar here represented the stalk, which was the first life that started in the promise. Sarah represents the tassel, or the pollen, comes in the tassel. Mary, the virgin, represented and produced the true spiritual Seed, to bring forth the real true stalk. Hagar and Sarah, both was by sex. But Mary, the virgin, was by the power of God's promised Word, by virgin birth. She brought forth the genuine Seed. The stalk, Hagar, the second wife, by doubt of the promise, working through a doubt, slightly.\n\nL-64 I just hope, may God help us. I don't... I want you to see this, so bad. You cannot slightly doubt any of It. You've got to take It just as It is. It needs no interpretation. The Bible says that, \"The Word of God is of no private interpretation.\" God don't need any of our schools to interpret His Word. When He vindicates It and makes It live, that's the interpretation of It. When God said, \"Let there be light,\" there was light. That don't need to be interpreted. When He said, \"A virgin shall conceive,\" she conceived. It doesn't need to be interpreted. [Genesis 1:3], [Isaiah 7:14]\n\nL-65 We don't need all this, its seminaries and things that gets men, \"Well, we got the interpretation. We got the interpretation.\"\n\nL-66 God Himself interpret His Own Word. He doesn't need anybody to interpret for Him. He said, \"It'll happen,\" and it happens. He said, \"In the last days, He would pour out His Spirit,\" He did it. I don't care what the denominations said. He did it, anyhow, 'cause He said He would do it. So, It doesn't need interpretation, for God does His Own interpretation. [Joel 2:25-29]\n\nL-67 And these things that you see, that seems to be mysterious to you now. If you would, you remember; your ministry, you Pentecostals, back yonder thirty or forty years ago, was just as much mystery to the--the church of the Methodist and Baptist, as This is to you today. But now find It in the Word. I'm trying to show you like you tried to show them. And then if God turns around and says It's so, in the Word, then confirms It to be so, that's God's Own interpretation. 65-0429B, The Seed Shall Not Be Heir With The Shuck, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 62 min You don't need anyone to interpret for you.\n\nL-68 Now, Hagar, by \"slightly\"! Remember, you cannot take one Word out of There. And Jesus said, in Revelations, at the close of the Book. And at the first of the Book, Christ said, \"Any man that took one Piece away from that Word!\" Just one Word misinterpreted, caused every sickness, death, that we've ever had. Well, if God, Who is holy, looked down; and caused all this chaos by just slightly misinterpreting one Word, and any little thing against that supreme Word caused all of this chaos; and the suffering, bleeding and dying of His Own Son, to reconcile this horrible thing back to Him; how are we going to get in anything less than keeping the whole Word?\n\nL-69 \"Well,\" you said, \"Brother Branham, that was in Genesis.\" I felt that, see.\n\nL-70 But let me tell you, Revelations, that's the last part of the Book. \"Whosoever shall take one Word out of the Book of this prophecy, or add one word to It, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.\" [Revelation 22:18-19]\n\nL-71 Jesus said, in the middle of the Book! There is your three witnesses again: Genesis, the New Testament, and the day today. Jesus said, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" \"Well, He didn't mean it.\" [Matthew 4:4]\n\nL-72 He was talking to people who were theologians, to the highest. Those priests, their great-great-great-great-great- grandfathers had to be priests. To misconstrue one Word of It, why, it was absolutely a death penalty. They had to be stoned, for one Word to be missed. But they had the wrong interpretation of It. Therefore when the Word Itself; when God promised to send the Messiah, and sent It in the very swaddling cloth that He promised It would come in, they had a different swaddling for It to be wrapped in.\n\nL-73 Let me say this. So is it today, that they don't get It! It's not in the swaddling of denominationalism or intellectual. It's in the swaddling of the power and the resurrection, and the manifestation of the risen Christ, the way God promised It, and not in the swaddling of people's thoughts of It.\n\nL-74 Now, Hagar, by one little slight difference, through woman, not through Abraham now. Abraham didn't want to do it, but God let him do it because he... Same thing, He let Balaam go on. Now notice, by slightly differing with It, she brought forth Ishmael, which was a wild man, never conquered. He lived by his bow. He was a wild man. He is yet, today. [Genesis 16:12]\n\nL-75 Now Sarah, the tassel, or pollen, Sarah, the true wife of the promise, brings forth a gentle man, in return brought forth a promised nation.\n\nL-76 Now, but, Mary, no sex, but through a promise, just like Abraham got the promise from God, the Word of God, but believed the promise, \"Behold the handsmaid of the Lord,\" see, brought forth not a stalk, but the original Seed, for He was the Word that Abraham believed and that Mary believed. [Luke 1:28]\n\nL-77 Now, Mary was not the Seed, she was only the shuck through the Seed. The two others was carriers of life, only the natural seed. Mary was not the Seed, herself; but like faith in God's Word, brought a more real image of the Word, because He was the Word. But like the shuck, the... of a wheat, a corn of wheat, the shuck holds the wheat inside of it and protects it until it is able or matured to go on its own. See? Then, it was the Seed Itself that left her. Just like, the Seed was in her womb, she wasn't the Seed. She didn't produce the Seed. God is the Seed.\n\nL-78 Now, the blood then, many people think that it was Jewish blood that we were saved by. And some of them said, \"Well, we got a right through the Gentiles, because Rahab the harlot and--and Ruth the Moabite, and so forth, they were Gentiles.\" You have no claim of that at all, neither one. He was neither Jew nor Gentile.\n\nL-79 He was God, the Logos, the Word that went out of God. When, He begin to brood upon the earth, and brought forth marine life. When the Spirit of God, the Logos, the Word, which God said, \"Let there be,\" and there went the Logos, which is the Word. And the Word begin to... 'cause all this was in the Logos; the whole Word of God, the whole Bible, for every age. And as the Logos begin to breathe upon the earth, there come marine life; and building up, the bird life, on up to animal life. And finally there come something in the representation, or looked like the thing that was brewing it, brooding over it, God, a man in the very image of God. [John 1:1-4] 65-0429B, The Seed Shall Not Be Heir With The Shuck, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 62 min\n\nL-80 That man fell, like the seed has to fall. And then God begin to brood over that, after the fall. He brought up a--a Enoch, He brought up a Elijah, He brought up a Moses, He brought up prophet after prophet, trying to restore that image again. And, finally, upon the earth came the genuine image of God Himself again, which was God, the Logos made flesh and dwelt among us.\n\nL-81 Now that same Logos has a part, He has got a Bride, and the same Logos, this Word that cannot be tampered with, is brooding over the churches today, trying to bring back the Word to Its full manifestation. Which, the--the prophets was carriers to that Seed, and the church denominations has been carriers to the Seed now. Now notice, quickly, but like the shuck hugs, holds in the Seed now, then it leaves her.\n\nL-82 Jesus was God. He was. His Father was the great Logos Itself. And He could not pour It all in Moses, for he was a prophet.\n\nL-83 And the Word of the Lord always, never fails, comes to the prophet. There is no place, no time, in the Bible, or since the Bible, that the correct interpretation of the Word come to a theologian. It's not in the Scriptures. Never did the Pharisees, never did the Sadducees, and never did God raise a prophet out of any of them, and never did He in this last days. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-84 As soon as they raised it up, they all get together and make an organization out of it, there it dies. But it's for a purpose that He did this. We'll try to explain it, God helping us. Notice, see here how close the she, the church, the seed now, gets to look like the Seed Itself.\n\nL-85 Now you notice, when the seed goes into the ground, it's the original seed. When it comes forth, it brings forth a life. But what does the life do out of a seed of wheat? It doesn't produce the same stalk of wheat right then, or same grain of wheat. It's the life of the wheat, but it's in a carrier stage. And that was the first reformation, when Luther came forth out of the darkness of the chaos. It had to die.\n\nL-86 So many times, people sympathize. Oh, and I read a book not long ago, on, The Silent God, give by some of these modern philosophers who try to turn you away from God. If you don't know the Word of God and the plan of God, you can be easily shook. But when you see God's plan, His program, then by faith you know it's God; and God identifying Himself, doing just what He did in--in the other times, walking, proving.\n\nL-87 That's the reason Moses could not be shook. He talked face to face with God, and God told him, \"I am the One that was with Abraham back yonder. I'm the One that's made this promise. I'll be with you.\" How you going to stop that man then?\n\nL-88 As the prophet of old said, \"When the lion roars, who can but fear? And God has spoken, who can but prophesy?\" When we see the things that God promised at this hour, see it unfold, how can you stand still when you see that that's His way? What He said, it would happen. See all the mysterious things, but that's just exactly the way God said it would take place. [Amos 3:8]\n\nL-89 Now notice, \"she,\" the carrier. Now, Hagar come forth as a stalk, and then come the pollen, and then come the shuck, and then come the Seed. Now watch these carriers, I want you to watch, first.\n\nL-90 Now, the stalk does not look at all like the Seed, but the Life that was in the Seed is in the stalk. That was Luther. Now, the little stalk has many blades; it went off from Luther, into Zwingli, and on down to Calvin and many others.\n\nL-91 Now notice, then, it changed its position. Watch nature now forming to the Word of God, as the sun; death, burial, and resurrection. Then come the pollen, that was Wesley. And through there were many little pollens hanging on it, that actually looked a whole lot more like the Seed than what that leaf did, on the wheat or the corn. Looked a lot more like it; because, Wesley with the second Word, second Word of God, bringing His church up, come through sanctification. That was his message. All right.\n\nL-92 Then, after a while, that dropped off and went into the stalk again, and brought forth an ear of corn. But before this ear started, there was a shook, shuck, covering, husk. And any wheat raiser, corn raiser, if you'll dig in there and pick out that ear of corn or that ear of wheat, you will think that that little--that little first little thing is that grain of wheat. 65-0429B, The Seed Shall Not Be Heir With The Shuck, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 62 min But, now, there is the Pentecostal age. Now you can't, you, any theologian or...\n\nL-93 Any historian, rather, knows that that's the ages, the way they come. Take the--the Book of Revelation, take the church ages, and see if that isn't exactly the way they unfold.\n\nL-94 Now, from Wesley came forth Pilgrim Holiness, Nazarenes, and all them little holiness churches, a whole lot more closer to the Word than what the Lutheran reformation was. But, you see, when Luther organized, that just started those blades. And when this come up, all the Spirit left that Lutheran church, all but just the denominational, and the real true believers went into sanctification.\n\nL-95 And then when sanctification moved over, the Pilgrim Holiness, and so forth, and all the holiness organizations, Nazarenes, and so forth, It moved from there, right out into this Pentecostal age. And look at that little grain now, of wheat, it looks a million times more like the original wheat, that went into the ground, than what the stalk did or what the pollen did. But if you'll sit down, put it under a glass, and open those little shucks up, they're just carriers also. The grain hasn't started yet. It's a little bitty bud right at the back, with a big high-powered glass you can see that little tip, like a pin point, there comes the seed. And this here shuck that looks just exactly like the real thing, it isn't the real thing. It's only a womb.\n\nL-96 Like Mary's womb. Mary was not the Seed, in the representation here of the stalk. She was only a carrier of It, like the rest of it. But being called and chosen first, by God Himself, for this purpose, it looked more like as our Catholic friends would think, that she was the mother of God. No, she was not the mother of God, she neither was the Seed of God.\n\nL-97 The woman produces the egg. God produces the--the life. The hemoglobin, the blood, is in the male sex.\n\nL-98 A hen can lay an egg or a bird can lay an egg, in springtime build its nest, but, if that female bird hasn't been with the male bird, it won't hatch. It's dead. It'll rot right in the nest.\n\nL-99 As I often said, that's what's the matter with the churches today, they're rottening right in the nest, called Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostals, and so forth. If they're not in contact with the Word, Itself, they rot right in the nest, in their organization.\n\nL-100 Now, now some of them says then, the Protestant more or less believes that it was the Mary produced the egg. If that be so, look what you make Jehovah God doing. The egg cannot be produced without a sensation.\n\nL-101 So, you see, God made both egg and germ, He created both in the womb of Mary. And that Man was not nothing but God Himself made flesh and dwelt among us, Emmanuel, not just a fine man, a prophet; He was fine Man and Prophet; not a teacher, a theologian. Oh, He might--He might have been all of that; He was all in all. But above all that, He was God Himself. The Bible said, \"We are saved by the Blood of God.\" God Himself, not a third person or a second person. The Person, God Himself, great Jehovah, overshadowed Mary; and the Creator, and created both the blood cell, the life, and also the egg. [Ephesians 1:7], [Matthew 1:21-23]\n\nL-102 If you can get a Jew to see that, you, he knows who the Messiah is. When that John Ryan was healed up there at Benton Harbor, been blind for forty years. That rabbi asked me, he said, I had an interview with him, he said, \"You can't cut God in three pieces and give Him to a Jew.\"\n\nL-103 I said, \"Some of them does. But we don't cut God in three pieces.\" I said, \"Do you believe the prophets?\" \"Certainly, I believe the prophets,\" he said.\n\nL-104 I said, \"Who did Isaiah speak of, Isaiah 9: 6, 'unto us a Child is born'?\" He said, \"Why, it was the Messiah.\"\n\nL-105 I said, \"What relationship will Messiah be to God?\" That done it. I said now... He said, \"He'll be God.\"\n\nL-106 I said, \"Exactly right. 'His Name shall be called Counsellor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God, Everlasting Father.'\"\n\nL-107 There is where the oneness missed it, there is where the trinity missed it, both sides of the road. But the happy medium is right in between. If God could be His Own Father, if Jesus was His Own Father, He couldn't be. And if He 65-0429B, The Seed Shall Not Be Heir With The Shuck, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 62 min had another Father besides God, and the Bible said the \"Holy Ghost\" was His Father, and if they're two different spirits, He was an illegitimate child. That's right. Which was the Father of Him, God or the Holy Ghost? You say one and watch how embarrassed you're going to get. God was His Father. Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-108 Matthew 1:18, He said. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When... his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with a child of the Holy Ghost. [Matthew 1:18]\n\nL-109 Now Who is His Father? See, see what I mean? Notice. ... Joseph her husband, being a just man... not willingly to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily, on this wise. Behold, while he thought on these things,... the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take in thy... unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of... [Congregation says, \"... the Holy Ghost.\"--Ed.] [Matthew 1:19-20]\n\nL-110 I thought they said, \"God the Father was His Father\"? Oh, theologians, where is your understanding? Notice, \"It shall be Light about the evening time!\"\n\nL-111 The true Seed come forth from Mary, but it was not her Seed. It was the promise of God, that she said, \"Behold the handsmaid of the Lord.\" The carriers of life was the women. And now, Mary, the Seed so much closer. [Luke 1:38]\n\nL-112 Hagar had to receive it in a perverted way. Sarah, doubting the thing, brought it to just a natural seed, sexual desire. But Mary, without any sex at all, believed the Word, and the Word was made flesh.\n\nL-113 But notice, Mary being so close, she held the Seed in her womb, and it looked like it would be her Seed. And so has Pentecostals. I'm going to come home. But remember, Jesus said, in Matthew the 24th chapter, 24th verse, \"In the last days, the two spirits...\" Not in the early days, now. \"In the latter times, the two spirits would be so close together until it would deceive the very elected if it were possible.\" Pentecostal spirit, just exactly like the real thing, so perfect that it would deceive the very elected if it was possible. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-114 Now, that's not my words. That's what He said. Now, after while, maybe you'll get an understanding of what I'm trying to say. Now that Seed certainly looked more...\n\nL-115 That shuck looked more like the Seed, until more than the pollen did, and more than what the stalk did, but they were only carriers of the Seed. See, Luther organized, the stalk died; Wesley organized, the pollen died; Pentecost organized, the life died. And now comes forth the Seed. You can't go any further than the Seed.\n\nL-116 Notice, all through the years, when a great move rises up, right quickly behind it comes an organization. About three years is about as long as the revival lasts, then they organize it, makes an organization. It has to be many off of it; like many off of Luther, the blades; and many off the pollen, Wesley; and the Pentecostal leaves going out, oneness, twoness, threeness, fourness, fiveness. Oh, mercy! See?\n\nL-117 But, notice, twenty years of Jesus Christ manifested! Not one organization has roused, and not one will; it'll die like every latter rain move, and everything else. This is the end time, the Seed, and it won't be heir with the shuck, no more than Ishmael was heir with Isaac.\n\nL-118 See here now how close she is, close enough to deceive. Luther, the stalk; Wesley, the tassel; and Mary, the shuck, or the womb, or Pentecost. How I could go right here on that shuck, and show you. Down through the age, it's never come so close till like it is right now. Everything is the church, the church, see, the \"she.\"\n\nL-119 And notice, it was the \"she,\" in the beginning, that doubted the original promise. It wasn't God took His Word back. God isn't taking His Word back today; He is confirming His original Word! But Sarah said, \"Maybe, peradventure; we're waiting.\"\n\nL-120 That's what's the matter with the people today, you're trying to climb into something that you don't know what you're climbing into. How you going to do it unless you know what you're doing? Are you walking blindfolded? Trying to climb into something that you don't know what you're doing, you'll fall. \"If the blind leads the blind, they 65-0429B, The Seed Shall Not Be Heir With The Shuck, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 62 min both fall in the ditch,\" Jesus made that quotation. [Matthew 15:14]\n\nL-121 But now we're standing at the time of the Seed. Now the Seed will hold, (what?) support, cooperate with the Seed holding It. It was set there for that purpose, to hold it.\n\nL-122 Because, as the sun comes up in the early spring, upon the wheat, watch the whole nature through the season roll, through the day roll, everything roll just perfectly right, with God. Now when that warm sun begins to shine upon the seed, it breaks forth. But the world has to be in a certain position to make that Seed break forth out of the dirt. It has to come around this a way, and get in a certain position to make that seed come forth. It had to come that way, to get it up out of the... upon the dark age.\n\nL-123 Some people, this critic that I said wrote the book, A Silent God, he said, \"All through the dark ages, them poor martyrs died, they went down, them Christians, and God sit in Heaven as if He wasn't even concerned.\" Why, the poor illiterate, blinded, spiritual blinded man, if his eyes were only opened! Don't you know the seed has to lay in the dirt, to die and to rot, before it can bring forth again?\n\nL-124 And the church of pentecost died, through the early Catholic church. And she just come in a stalk form, but you see how closely she is shaping, each one through the Lutheran, Wesley, Pentecostal age? You understand? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-125 Now It's got to come right straight back to that original ministry that He had here on earth, 'cause it's the Bride. They are one. Now He promised, in the last days, how these things would happen. And we see them happening, like all the promises, Malachi 4, Saint Luke 17:30. Oh, how many more Scriptures, it'd be endless!\n\nL-126 And, oh, I'm going to have to stop, 'cause it's late. Yeah. All right, you--you tell them, see if they can get... You ask them, see, and then you come tell me. Now, just a minute. I want to get this, so bad, see. I--I want you to see this, so bad. Look, Jesus... Notice, see, the Bride.\n\nL-127 Still, we find out, in this age that we're now living, see, that the womb, the Pentecostal organization, looked just exactly like the real thing. But did you realize that, Revelation 17, it called the Roman Catholic church, the first organization, a \"whore\"? How many knows that's true? How many know that she was the mother of harlots? What is the immoral woman? Now, He said this woman was the \"church.\" What is the whore? Is a woman that's untrue to her marriage vow. What is a harlot? Same thing, same word. [Revelation 17:1-18]\n\nL-128 Now, she gave birth. What kind of birth? Not to the Word, but to organization birth. Here is Methodist, Baptist, and Pentecostals, and they all took the habits of their mother. Any ornery-ish woman in California can give birth to a virgin girl; and that's why the first message come forth, but when truth was presented to Luther's age, of sanctification, he couldn't take it. When the baptism of the Holy Ghost was permitted, presented to the Methodists, they couldn't take it. And now when the Seed time has produced a pentecost, she can't take It. She is organized. But she has been a carrier of the Seed, see.\n\nL-129 [A brother speaks in another tongue. Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Amen. Now thank the Lord for that, the Word, the simplicity of the Word that was said.\n\nL-130 See, it's just simple, just like in this, just like watching the corn grow. You don't have to have some great theological interpretation of it. Just watch it. You're... He's right around you, all the time. See, the... it's a...\n\nL-131 I got to stop. I felt the little pull, and I asked him to do that. We've got to close. Now, brother, just this one remark, then I'll go.\n\nL-132 Look, now. The shuck, the stalk, and so forth, are only carriers of the Word. They had part of the Word, see, until they got down; justification, sanctification, restoration of gifts in--in Pentecostals. But now notice. Just as it was Ishmael, Isaac, see, and then to Jesus; see, one was a perverted, one was the original, and here comes the Seed Itself. See? Now, the church has come from that same thing, right back. Like a flower or anything else, it drinks, pulls in, and goes...\n\nL-133 That don't mean the Lutheran is lost. The Lutheran that rejected sanctification, would be, that wants to hold onto 65-0429B, The Seed Shall Not Be Heir With The Shuck, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 62 min the something... You see, Israel eat new manna every night, see. Notice.\n\nL-134 But now at the end time, look at this shuck here, now notice, in the wheat. The complete mystery of--of the Life is sealed up inside that shuck. We see it in Luther, coming up. We see it in tassel, coming out. We see it in the stalk. We come over here, and now it's in the shuck form, almost like at the pentecostal age, but the real mystery is hid inside.\n\nL-135 Now remember, according to Revelation, the whole mystery of the Book is sealed with Seven Seals, that the reformers didn't have a chance to bring forth, the four stages of reforming, the four stages of four Beasts that went out to meet the four powers of the world. The first went out, was a... [Revelation 5:1]\n\nL-136 What was the first went out? A lion, to meet the Roman age. That was the Word, the original. He is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Christ Himself went to meet that age. What was the next animal that went out to meet; the next animal went out, to meet the other horse rider, what was he? See, that first horse rider was dressed in white, crowned on his head, later, so forth, but a bow with no arrows. [Revelation 6:2], [Revelation 4:7]\n\nL-137 Notice the second horse that went forth, the Beast that went to meet him was an ox. An ox is a beast of sacrifice. They went down in martyrdom during the dark age. [Revelation 4:7], [Revelation 6:4]\n\nL-138 The third Beast that went to meet the next horse, before death horse rode, death and hell, the next horse that went... The next Beast that went to meet the horse rider of that day, was the Beast with the face of a man. How many knows that? The intellectual age, the reformers, Luther, Wesley, Calvin, Knox, Finney, Moody. See? [Revelation 6:5], [Revelation 4:7]\n\nL-139 But then notice, what went forth in the evening time? [A brother says, \"Eagle!\"--Ed.] An eagle, prophetic back again. It shall be Light about the eagle time, the way to Glory you will surely find, O Church of the living God! [Zechariah 14:7], [Revelation 4:7]\n\nL-140 I wish I could come here and--and just sit down of a morning, and stay all day, fellowship with you around these things. Listen, do you think I don't like you? I love you, my brothers. I--I--I would like to go to every organization and co-op-... and--and just believe with each one. But, you see, it just can't. There is hardly a door open for me.\n\nL-141 I'm slipping into a nation right now, because of organization, because that they won't let the ministry that God... I wrote them a letter back, I said, \"For ten years I've tried to come in. And you with your crazy baptism!\"\n\nL-142 One of them believes, \"You got to be baptized three times; once for the Father, and once for the Son, and Holy Ghost; face forward.\" The other said, \"No, you got to be baptized three times backwards; once for the Son, once for the Father, and Holy Ghost.\" And they're both wrong.\n\nL-143 One said, \"He, you're baptized to His death, and He pitched forward when He died. We're baptized to His death.\" The other one said, \"Who burys a man on his face? You bury him, backwards.\" Such nonsense, separating people, it shows it's jealousy. It's from Satan. It isn't of God.\n\nL-144 In the midst of both sides, God is neither on either side, but He is calling from both sides, \"Come out from among them, and be ye separated,\" saith God, \"and I will receive you unto Myself.\" God bless you.

I can't get to all of them at once. But, listen.\n\nL-2 I'm certainly happy to be here again, tonight, in this beautiful auditorium, amongst this wonderful group of people. And we was coming in, out there, a few moments ago, the people standing out on the street said they couldn't get in. And I said, \"Well, maybe I can get you some room.\" And they wouldn't let them come down. So I'm sorry we don't have enough room for them. They said the basement was full, also. And so we are sorry about that. But we're happy to be here, and happy to see all this fine group of ministers, the businessmen here, and all you delegations from different parts of the country.\n\nL-3 I had the grand privilege of speaking this morning at the breakfast, which I certainly cherish to be an honor to speak before such fine people. I was on a subject of: The Shuck Won't Be Heir With The Wheat. I didn't get to finish it. And it was not the--the brother's fault. He tried to get the management to let us stay a little longer, but he just wouldn't do it. I certainly appreciate that, Brother Demos. That's very, very nice. I certainly thank you for your kindness, each and every one. But they just wouldn't let us do it. So we just had to--had to close off. I'll pick that up, some other time, to finish that up: The Shuck Will Not Be Heir With The Wheat. Did you understand it, you that were here? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] I hope there was enough that it would be understood.\n\nL-4 Now, I know, tonight, there's a panel, also, so I don't want to keep you here long enough that you'd miss that. Because, I do think that was certainly an asset to--to the Pentecostal-believing people, that panel we saw the other night. Such a fine bunch of men, such wonderful answers, straight. It made me feel real good, to see that. I trust that the Lord will bless it, tonight. And ever who that looks, may they believe. That would be my sincere prayer.\n\nL-5 And so many reports coming in, today, from in the mail and by calls, of so many being healed in this meeting. I was so glad of that. That, that's, to see people sick, that's kind of my ministry.\n\nL-6 I--I get up here to preach. I, you know, I'm not a preacher. But I, with this, my Kentucky grammar, \"his, hain't\" and--and all those words, so I--I can't say as what we call a modern preacher of today. I--I couldn't take that place, because I--I have no education.\n\nL-7 But I do like to express what I know about It, to others, or what I feel that I know about It, to others, how I've learned It, how He is to me. He's all my life, all that I could ever expect to be, and so much more than I ever thought, that I'd ever have a friend, hardly, on the earth, when I was a little boy. But I certainly am thankful for great friends today.\n\nL-8 [A brother says, \"Having a little trouble hearing back there, Brother Branham. Get in closer.\"--Ed.] Oh, I'm sorry. I--I'm kind of out of focus here, somewhere, he said.\n\nL-9 Now, to get right straight into the service, let's turn for some Scripture readings. I--I always like to read the Bible, because It's the Word of God. I believe that. And I believe It to be God's infallible Word. And now I have a few Scriptures written down here, and some notes that I'd like to refer to, for a few moments, maybe for forty-five minutes.\n\nL-10 And then we'll get out in time to go see this wonderful panel again tonight. And I trust that God will continue to bless you right on through. And I know what you got to do. And I'm supposed to drive to Tucson, yet, tonight, see, so you can imagine. That's ten-hours drive.\n\nL-11 And I'm leaving for overseas, and I've got to get a yellow fever shot on test in the morning at the government. So I--I got to get over there. I had the postponement, the other day, and they're not going to take no \"no\" for an answer again now. And I got one more tetanus and typhus to take, and my boosters.\n\nL-12 So, I so thankful for this opportunity, and--and this fine meeting we had prior the convention. It certainly did thrill my heart. You're a fine bunch of people. I trust that God will bless you. 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min\n\nL-13 When the great hour ever... That great monster laying up yonder, that flipped hisself over in Alaska, a few days ago, threw its tail up again this morning, along about, down around in Washington. He could head this way, mighty easy. And if the Holy Spirit ever tells me definitely...\n\nL-14 Someone has been answer... asking me that, \"Is it going to happen here, Brother Branham?\" No, I don't know that. I just don't know, until I do know. That's the truth.\n\nL-15 I always want to be honest with you. I just not going to presume, take any ideas, or some, what I believe, or something like that. When I tell you, it's going to be. Well, He's got to tell me, first, and then I'll tell you. I--I know the whole world is in a shaking condition. We're at the end time. But one thing I've tried to be...\n\nL-16 Brother Shakarian was saying this morning, how he used to go through the prayer lines, and reach down there and get those cards before the people would come up, and look at them, and see whether--whether I told them what they had wrote out there. They write all kinds of stuff on their prayer cards, you know, and he just wanted to see if it was right. He said, out of the hundreds that he had checked, there had never been one wrong. [Brother Shakarian says, \"Never one wrong.\"--Ed.] There never will be one wrong, see, because, as--as long as it's God. If I ever project myself into it, then it's wrong right there to begin with.\n\nL-17 Little girl whose father is setting, listening at me now, come to me, not long ago. She had a dream. She said, \"Brother Branham, what does this dream mean?\" I said, \"I don't know, sister. I'll have to find out, if the Lord will tell me.\" So I went on and tried to ask the Lord, and He never did tell me. The little girl come back again. She said, \"Well, now where is the interpretation of my dream?\"\n\nL-18 I said, \"Come here, honey, sit down.\" I said, \"Your father and mother are very good friends of mine. See? And they've come all the way from Canada, retired, and sojourned here with me. They believe this, what I'm trying to say. And I've never said anything wrong to anybody, willfully, in my life. If I... I think I know what the dream means. But until I see that dream myself, and then He tells me what it means, I can't tell you. See, if I just make up something, there might be a time where you needed me between life and death, and then you wouldn't know whether to believe me or not.\"\n\nL-19 If I tell you anything in the Name of the Lord, it's truly that. That's Who told me that. And so far, of all these years, throughout the world, and around the world, It's never been wrong one time. Cause... And, now, you know a human being can't be that infallible. It takes the Spirit of God to do that.\n\nL-20 And now I have a Message that I'm responsible for. And many times I've been considered, amongst the people, well, maybe someone who just didn't sit down and think a minute, that I was a--a, oh, an awful person, I didn't like people, and I was always cutting them. And that's not so. That isn't so. I love people. But, you know, love is corrective.\n\nL-21 If your little boy was sitting in the street out there, and you said, \"Junior, dear, I don't want you out there, but...\" And cars buzzing by him, and you brought him in. He run back out again. Why, you should correct him. If you love him, you will. You have to.\n\nL-22 If you seen a man floating down a river, towards a falls, in a little boat, that you knowed that boat was going to sink when he hit the falls, would you say, \"John, you, maybe you ought to think a while, maybe you might not make it\"? If I know he's not going to make it, I'm going to almost jerk him out of the boat, if I can, because it's love that does that.\n\nL-23 And now, in these Messages that I speak, I never try to bring in any doctrine, or so forth. I--I do that in my own church. But out here amongst men and women who are different denominations with different ideas, I just try to take in a mild form, explain; but enough to where if you're born of the Spirit of God, I believe you'll understand what I mean, among Christian men, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, whatmore.\n\nL-24 Now, tonight, I want to turn to Genesis, the 24th chapter. I want to read the... beginning with the 12th verse of the 24th chapter of Genesis. 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min And he said, O LORD God... my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down the pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou has appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou has showed me kindness to... unto my master. [Genesis 24:12-14]\n\nL-25 And then in the Book of Revelation. That's the first of the Bible, Genesis. Now, in the last of the Bible, I want to read in the 21st chapter of Revelation, and the 9th verse.\n\nL-26 We know what this Scripture of Genesis here... You read the whole chapter, if you wish to. It's God sending out Eliezer. Or, Abraham sending out Eliezer, pardon me, to select a bride for Isaac. And the beautiful Rebekah came out, and in perfect answer to the prayer that--that Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, had just prayed. Now in the 9th verse of the 21st chapter of Revelations. And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, and I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. [Revelation 21:9]\n\nL-27 Now I want to take for a subject, tonight, for that: The Choosing Of A Bride. And this is, if my brother that records here will, this is the tape that you can go ahead and let out.\n\nL-28 Now, in this, it doesn't exactly mean that I'm speaking this to this congregation present, but these tapes go around the world. They're translated in, practically, oh, a great deal of the languages, even into the heathen lands around the world. We send them tapes, free, on a society of the church. And they're translated. And all out through the jungles of Africa, and to India, and around the world, goes these tapes. Now, choosing a Bride!\n\nL-29 In many things of life we are given a choice. The way of life, itself, is a choice. We have a right to make our own way, choose our own way that we want to live.\n\nL-30 Education is a choice. We can choose whether we're going to be educated, or whether we are not going to be educated. That's a choice that we have.\n\nL-31 Right and wrong is a choice. Every man, every woman, boy and girl, has to choose whether they are going to try to live right or not live right. It's a choice. Choice is a great thing.\n\nL-32 Your Eternal destination is a choice. And maybe, tonight, some of you will make that--that choice, of where you'll spend Eternity, before this service ends tonight. There'll be one time, that, if you turned God down many time, there'll be one time you'll turn Him down the last time. There is a line between mercy and judgment. And it's a dangerous thing for a man or a woman, boy or girl, to step across that line, for there's no return when you step across that deadline. So, tonight, it might be the time that many will make their--their decision, where they will spend the endless Eternity.\n\nL-33 There's another choice that we have in life, that's, a life's companion. A young man or young woman, stepping out on life, has--has been given a right to make a choice. The young man chooses. The young woman has a right to accept or reject it. But it's still a choice, on both sides. Both man and woman, they have a right to choice. Also, you have a choice, as a Christian.\n\nL-34 You have a choice of the church, here in America, so far, that you can go to. That's your own American privilege, to choose any church that you want to belong to. That's a choice. You don't have to go to any of them, if you don't want to. But if you want to change from the Methodist to the Baptist, or the Catholic to a Protestant, or so forth, there's nobody can tell you or make you come to any certain church. That's our--that's our freedom. That's what our democracy is. Every man can choose for himself. Freedom of religion, and that's a--a great thing. God help us to keep 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min it as long as we can.\n\nL-35 You have also a choice. Whether... When you choose this church, you can choose whether you, in this church, whether you will choose a church that will guide you to your Eternal destination. You can choose a church that has a certain creed, that you might think that creed is just what you want. Or, the other church has their creed.\n\nL-36 And then there is the Word of God, you have choice of. You have to make the choice. There's an unwritten law among us, of choosing.\n\nL-37 I believe it was Elijah, one time, up on Mount Carmel, after the showdown, in a great hour of the crisis that we're just about to come to right now. Perhaps, it may be to you or I, tonight, that we make this choice, like the Mount Carmel experience. Frankly, I think it's going on, worldwide, now. But there will soon be a time where that you'll have to make a choice. [I Kings 18:20-40]\n\nL-38 And you men here, of your denominational churches, just believe this, that the hour is right on you, when you're going to make a choice. You're either going to go into the World Council, or you're not going to be a denomination anymore. You're going to have to do that, and that choice is coming soon.\n\nL-39 And it's a dangerous thing to wait till that last hour, too, because you might take on something that you could never shake out of it. You know, there is a time when you can be warned, then, if you step across that line of warning, then you're already marked on the other side, branded.\n\nL-40 Remember, when the jubilee year come, and the--the priest rode with his trumpet sounding, that every slave could go free. But if they refused to accept their freedom, then he had to be taken to the temple, to a post, and an awl bore him through the ear, and then he served his master alway. It was put on his ear as a type, of hearing. \"Faith cometh by hearing.\" He heard that trumpet, but he didn't want to listen to it. [Leviticus 25:10], [Romans 10:17]\n\nL-41 And many time, men and women hear God's Truth, and see It vindicated and proven, Truth, but yet they don't want to hear It. There's some other reason. There's some other choosing that they have, than to face up to Truth and fact, therefore their ears can be closed to the Gospel. They'll never hear It again. My advice to you, when God speaks to your heart, you act right then.\n\nL-42 Elijah gave them a choice which they should. \"Choose you this day whom you shall serve. If God be God, serve Him. But if Baal be God, serve him.\" [I Kings 18:21]\n\nL-43 Now, as we see that all of the natural thing is a type of the spiritual things, as we went through in our lesson this morning, as the sun and his nature. That was my first Bible. Before I ever read a page in the Bible, I knew God. Because, the Bible is written everywhere in nature, and it just corresponds with the Word of God: how the death, burial, resurrection of the nature; and the sun rising, crossing, setting, dying, rising again. There's so many things that we could type, God in nature, that we have to bypass, for this Message.\n\nL-44 Now, if the spiritual or... The natural is a type of the spiritual. Then, the choosing of a bride, in the natural, is a type of choosing a Bride, the Bride, in the spiritual.\n\nL-45 Now, it's a serious thing when we go to choose a wife, a man, for the vows here is until death do we part. That's how we should keep it. And you take that vow before God, that only death will separate you. And I think we should. A man in his right mind, that's planning a future, that he should choose that wife very careful. Be careful what you're doing. And a woman choosing a husband, or accepting the choice of a husband, should be real careful what she's doing, and especially in these days. A man should think and pray before he chooses a wife.\n\nL-46 I think, today, what's got so many divorce cases now, that we lead the world in America, in divorce cases. We lead the rest of the world. There's more divorces here than anywhere else, this nation, and supposed to be, and thought of, a Christian nation. What a reproach, our divorce court! I think, the reason of it, is because that men has got away from God, and women has got away from God.\n\nL-47 And we find, that, if a man prayed and a woman prayed over the matter; not just look at a pretty set of eyes, or big strong shoulders, or such as that, or some other worldly affection; but would look first to God, and say, \"God, is this 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min Your plan?\"\n\nL-48 I think, today, there's so much cheating, just like in school. When--when the kids come by, of a morning, many of the kids in the neighborhood, that--that friends of mine, will come by and say, \"Brother Branham, will you pray for us? We're having a--a test today. I--I worked all night, and I don't seem I can--can get it settled. Pray for me.\" I think that any school kid, if you would, if... And the parents at the table of a morning, you could. Say, \"Mother, John has got a test today. Let's pray for him now.\" I think it would beat all that you could ever do in any other way, or looking over on somebody else's paper and cheating. I think if you just come out and pray over the matter.\n\nL-49 And if we would study what we're doing when we're going to get married, when we choose our wife, our husband, if we'd study it over! A man should pray earnestly, for he could ruin his entire life. Remember, the vow is \"until death do we part,\" and he could ruin his life by making the wrong choice. But if he knows what, he making the wrong choice and is marrying a woman that isn't fit to be his wife, and he does it anyhow, then it's his fault. If the woman takes a husband and knows that he's not fit to be a husband to you, then that's your own fault, after you know what's right and wrong. So, you shouldn't do it until you thoroughly pray through. [Mark 10:9]\n\nL-50 The same applies by choosing a church. Now, you must pray over the church that you are fellowshiping in. Remember, churches carry spirit.\n\nL-51 Now, I don't want to be critical. But I realize that I'm an old man, and I got to leave here, one of these days. I've got to answer at the Day of the Judgment for what I say tonight or any other time. And I, therefore, I got to be dead earnest and truly convicted.\n\nL-52 But, you go into a church, and if you'll watch the behavior of that church, you just watch the pastor awhile, and you'll usually find that the church acts like the pastor. Sometime, I wonder if we just don't get one another's spirit in the stead of the Holy Spirit. You get to a place where a pastor is real radical and carrying on, you'll find out the congregation is the same way. I'll bring you to a church where I see the pastor stand, jerk their heads back and forth. You watch the congregation, they do the same thing. You take a pastor, just gulp down anything, usually the church will do the same thing. So, if I was choosing a church, I'd choose a genuine, fundamental, Full Gospel, Bible church, I was choosing one to put my family in. Choose. I looked...\n\nL-53 The boys, the other day, Brother Shakarian's son and his son-in-law, taken me up here to pray for a young fellow, singer, dandy boy. Just come back... Fred Barker, that was his name, just come back from a trip. And they called me, that, \"Fred was dying.\" And then, 'fore I could get in the house, another message come, \"He may be dead right now.\" And he said he had had a--a hemorrhage in the brain, and he was paralyzed, and--and he was dying, and his wife wanted me to pray for him.\n\nL-54 And I thought, \"Oh, if I try to fly, he'd be dead 'fore I get there, and may be dead now.\" So, I called quickly and got the little lady on the phone. And--and we got the phone hooked up, and to Fred's ear. He couldn't swallow. They was giving him artificial swallowing. And when we prayed for him, he said, motioned, take it out of his throat. He could swallow. The doctors didn't believe it. They took it out, and he could swallow. He was setting up, the other day. A church; choosing a church.\n\nL-55 Phone call just come in, a while ago. This morning, a member of my church, which is really a Baptist woman out of Louisville, she died early this morning. And my church at home, a real group of consecrated men, assembled themselves together and went down, before the undertaker embalmed her, stood over her, prayed until life come back in her. And she is living, tonight. The elders of my church, why, they been taught to believe that all things are possible, come to God sincerely. So, you must make the right choice. [Matthew 19:26]\n\nL-56 Again, the kind of woman that a man would choose, will reflect his ambition and his character. If a man chooses the wrong woman, it reflects his character. And what he ties himself to, shows truly what's in him. A woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for wife. It shows what's down in him. No matter what he says outside, watch what he married. 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min\n\nL-57 I go to a man's office, and he says he's a Christian; pin-ups all around on the walls, that old boogie-woogie music going on. I don't care what he says. I don't believe his testimony, because his spirit is feeding on them things of the world. What, say, if he would marry a chorus girl, or what if he would marry a sex queen, or just a pretty, modern ricketta? It reflects. It shows what he has in his mind, of what his future home is going to be, because he's took her to raise his children by. And whatever she is, that's the way she'll raise those children. So, it reflects what's in the man. A man that takes a woman like that, shows just what he's thinking of the future.\n\nL-58 Could you imagine a Christian doing a thing like that? No, sir. I could not. A true Christian will not look for such beauty queens, and chorus girls, and sex queens. He'll look for Christian character.\n\nL-59 Now, you can't have all things. There might be one girl that's real pretty. And the other girl, maybe she's a... her statue looks better than this one. And you might have to sacrifice one for the other, but, if she's not the statue of a lady, of a woman. And, she, I didn't care whether she's pretty or not. You better look at her character, whether she's pretty or not pretty.\n\nL-60 Now, for, it is becoming, if a Christian would choose a wife, he ought to choose a genuine, born-again woman, regardless of what she looks like. It's what she is, what makes her. And then, again, that reflects his own godly character, and reflects what's in his mind and what's going to be in the future, for his family will be raised by such a woman, for the future plans for his home.\n\nL-61 If he marries one of these little modern rickettas, sex queens, what could he expect? What kind of a home could a man expect to have? If he marries a girl that ain't got enough moral about her to stay home and take care of a house, and wants to work out in somebody's office, what kind of a housekeeper will she be? You'll have baby-sitters and everything else. True.\n\nL-62 Now, I'm not much of this modernistic taste, of women working. When I seen these women with these uniforms on, riding around in this city, on motorcycles, as police, it's a disgrace to any city that will let a woman do that. See? See? As many men that's without work, it shows the modern thinking of our city. It shows the degrading. We don't have to have them women out there like that. They ain't got no business out there like that.\n\nL-63 When God gave a man a wife, He gave him the best thing He could give him, outside of salvation. But when one goes to trying to take a man's place, then she's about the worse thing that he could get a hold of. Now, that's right. See? Now we can see the spiritual application. [Proverbs 31:10-31]\n\nL-64 I--I know that's bad, you think it's bad, but it's the Truth. We don't care how bad it is, we got to face up to the fact. That's what the Bible teaches. See?\n\nL-65 Now, we here see plainly the spiritual plan, of God's planning for His future Home with His future Bride, comes into view now.\n\nL-66 If a man marries a sex queen, you see what he's looking for for the future. If a man marries a woman that won't stay home, you see what he's looking for in the future. And I one time...\n\nL-67 This sounds awful. I just feel to say it. And I--I, usually, if I feel to say the thing, I ought to say it. And it's usually God's way.\n\nL-68 I--I used to go with a rancher that I worked with, to buy cattle. And I noticed the old fellow always looking right in the face of a heifer before he went to bidding. Then he turned her head, and looked back and forth. I followed him along, watched him. And he looked her up and down, if she looked all right, the statue. Then he turned and looked her in the face, and sometime he'd shake his head and walk away. I said, \"Jeff, I want to ask you something.\" He said, \"Say on, Bill.\"\n\nL-69 And I said, \"Why you always look that cow in the face?\" I said, \"She looks all right, a good--good heavy cow.\"\n\nL-70 Said, \"I want to tell you, boy, you got a lot to learn.\" And I--I realized it after he told me. Said, \"I don't care how she's made up. She might be beef, plumb to the hoof. But if she's got that wild stare in her face, don't you never buy 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min her.\" Said, \"Why so, Jeff?\"\n\nL-71 \"Well,\" said, \"the first thing is,\" said, \"she'll never stay put.\" And he said, \"The next thing is, she'll never be a mammy to her calf.\" And said, \"They put her in a pen now, the reason she's fat. You turn her loose, with that wild stare, she'd run herself to death.\"\n\nL-72 I said, \"You know, I kind of learned something. I believe that applies to women, too.\" Right. Right.\n\nL-73 That wild, starey, ricketta look, better stay away from her, boy, all that there blue stuff over top her eyes. And I didn't... I wouldn't want that. I don't think that's becoming to a Christian. I don't care how much the television and paper says it's pretty. It's the most horrible-looking, hideous sight that I ever seen in my life.\n\nL-74 When I first seen that, here at Clifton's Cafeteria, one morning, at a breakfast. I seen some, them young ladies come up. Brother Arganbright had just come in, and I. And he had went downstairs. I looked, and that girl come in. I thought, \"Well, I--I--I--I don't know.\" I never seen it before. It was some kind. Oh, it looked like she was cankered, you know, just kind of funny-looking. I'm not saying that to be funny. I'm--I'm saying it. You know, I've seen leprosy. I'm a missionary. I seen all kinds of freaks, you know, of how diseases. And I was going to walk up to the young lady and tell her, \"I--I--I'm a minister. I--I pray for the sick. Would--would you like for me to pray for you?\" And I had never seen anything like that. And then, here come two or three more, in. I kind of stepped back then and waited.\n\nL-75 And Brother Arganbright come by, so I said, \"Brother Arganbright?\" He may be here. I said, \"What's the matter with that woman?\" See? And he said, \"That, that's paint.\"\n\nL-76 I said, \"Well, my, my!\" See? I thought they ought to have her in a pesthouse somewhere, you know, keep it from breaking out all over other women.\n\nL-77 But, you know, you have to plan, look, pray, when you're choosing. For, we see, by this, the Word of promise. She, the bride that a man would choose, is going to reflect his character. It reflects what's in him.\n\nL-78 Now, could you imagine a man, filled with the Holy Ghost, take something like that to be a wife? [Congregation says, \"No.\"--Ed.] I--I--I just don't see it, brother. Now, maybe I'm just an old crank. But, you know, I--I just can't understand that, see, notice, for it's going to reflect what's in him. She is going to help him make his future home.\n\nL-79 Now, then, when we change back now for a moment, to the spiritual side. And when you see a church that's in the world, acts like the world, anticipating in the world, partaking of the world, counting God's Commandments as if He never had wrote Them, then you--you can just imagine Christ ain't going to take a Bride like that. Could you imagine taking the modern church today for a Bride? Not my Lord. I don't... I could hardly see that. No. Remember, now, a man and his wife are one. Would you join yourself to a person like that? If you would, it would certainly kind of disappoint my faith in you.\n\nL-80 And, then, how about God joining Himself to something like that, a regular denominational prostitute? You think He would do it, \"Having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof\"? He would never do it. She must have His character in her. The real, true born-again Church must have the--the character that was in Christ, because the husband and wife are one. And if Jesus did only that which pleased God, kept His Word and manifested His Word, His Bride will have to be of the same kind of character. She could not, by no means, be a denomination. Because, then, no matter how much you want to say, \"no,\" she is controlled by a board somewhere, that tells her what to do and what she can't do, and, many times, a million miles off of the true Word. [II Timothy 3:5], [Mark 10:8]\n\nL-81 It's too bad that we ever got away from the real Leader that God left us to lead the Church. He never sent state presbyters. He never sent a bishops, cardinals, priests, popes. He sent the Holy Ghost for the Church, to lead the Church. \"When He the Holy Ghost is come, He will lead you into all Truth, reveal these things to you, that I have told you, bring them to your remembrance, and will show you things that is to come.\" The Holy Spirit was to do that. Now, the modern church hates That. They don't like It, so how could she be the Bride of Christ? The people of today is choosing a modern denomination. What it does, it only reflects their poor understanding of the Word. [John 14:26] 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min\n\nL-82 I don't mean to hurt, but I mean to let it go deep enough till you'll look at it.\n\nL-83 I've married many couples, but it always reminds me of Christ and His Bride. One of the weddings that I performed here, some time ago, it--it was quite an outstanding thing in my life. It's been several years ago, when I was just a young minister.\n\nL-84 My brother was working on the--the P.W.A. I don't know whether anybody ever remembers that, yet, or not, anybody as old as me. And that was a--a project that the government had. And my brother worked up, about thirty miles. They were digging out some lakes, a project for the conservation.\n\nL-85 And there was a boy worked up there, with him, from Indianapolis, about, oh, about a hundred miles above Jeffersonville where I--I live, or lived. And there was a... He said to my brother, one day. He said, \"Doc,\" he said, \"I--I want... I'm going to get married, if I just had enough money to pay the preacher.\" He said, \"I--I got enough money to get my license, but,\" said, \"I haven't got enough money to pay the preacher.\"\n\nL-86 Doc said, \"Well, my brother is a preacher, and--and he--he may marry you.\" He said, \"He never charges people for things like that.\" He said, \"Will you ask him if he'll marry me?\"\n\nL-87 Well, that night my brother asked me. I said, \"If he's never been married before, either one of them, and their everything is all right.\" He said, \"Well, yeah, I'll ask him.\" And I said, \"If it is, tell him, come on down.\"\n\nL-88 So, when Saturday come along and the boy came down. Been a great thing for me, to always look back upon this. I'd... Rainy afternoon, and an old Chevrolet car, with the headlights wired on with a baling wire, that drove up, out front. Just a while after I had lost my wife, and I was bach'ing, two little rooms. And--and Doc was up there with me, waiting for them.\n\nL-89 And--and a boy got out of the car, and he certainly didn't look like a groom, to me, or would to anybody, I guess. Yeah. I could bare... buy a pretty good pair of shoes, for a dollar and a half. And he had on a pair, was run over. And his trousers was real baggy. And he had on one of these old moleskin jackets. I don't guess some of you older people would remember. It looked like it had run through a washing machine without being rinsed, and it was streaked, tied up like this, and the corner up.\n\nL-90 And a--a little lady got out on the side, with a little, oh, some of them little checkered-look dress.\n\nL-91 I don't know. I made a mistake on calling that kind of goods, one time. Gingham, I believed it's called. And so it was a... I said it wrong again. I--I'm always doing it. And I said...\n\nL-92 She got out of the car, and they come up the steps. And--and when they walked in, the poor little thing, she... I guess, she, just about all she had on was a skirt. And she didn't have no shoes, hardly, on. She had hitchhiked from Indianapolis, down. Had a little hair hanging down, back, in long, kind of a plaits down her back. Looked very young. And I said to her, \"Are you old enough to get married?\"\n\nL-93 She said, \"Yes, sir.\" And she said, \"I have my written permission from my father and mother.\" She said, \"I had to show it to--to the court here, to get my license.\"\n\nL-94 I said, \"All right.\" I said, \"I'd like to talk to you a little bit before we perform this wedding.\" They set down. The boy kept looking around the room; needed a haircut real bad. And he kept looking around the room. He wasn't listening to me. I said, \"Son, I want you to listen to what I'm saying.\" Said, \"Yes, sir.\" And I said, \"You love this girl?\" He said, \"Yes, sir. I do.\" I said, \"You love him?\" \"Yes, sir. I do.\"\n\nL-95 I said, \"Now, have you got a place to take her after you marry?\" Said, \"Yes, sir.\" 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min\n\nL-96 I said, \"All right. Now,\" I said, \"I want to ask you something. I understand, you're working up here on this P.W.A.\" And he said, \"Yes, sir.\" That's about twelve dollars a week. I said, \"You think you can make a living for her?\" He said, \"I'll do all I can do.\"\n\nL-97 And I said, \"Well, that's all right.\" And I said, \"Now, what if he gets out of... What if he loses this job, sister? What are you going to do, going to run back up home, to mama, papa?\" She said, \"No, sir. I'm going to stay with him.\"\n\nL-98 And I said, \"What, sir, if you have three or four children, nothing to feed them, and you haven't got any work. What are you going to do, send her away?\"\n\nL-99 Said, \"No, sir. I'll struggle right on. We'll make it, some way.\"\n\nL-100 I felt little. And I seen that he really loved her, and they loved one another. I married them.\n\nL-101 Then I wondered where he taken her. A few days, I asked my brother, Doc, where it is. He said, \"Go down to New Albany,\" a little city below us.\n\nL-102 And down on the river, where I had some tin laying up, where I went every day when I--I was a lineman. So when the rest the fellows, they all sit around, told jokes and things, I'd get in the truck and run down on the river and pray during that!...?... And read my Bible, under a big piece of tin where an old iron works used to be. There's a bunch of old boxcars setting down there.\n\nL-103 And this fellow had went down there and got one of them boxcars and sawed him a door in it. And had taken a newspaper and tacky buttons.\n\nL-104 How many knows what a tacky button is? There's no Kentuckians here, then. It's, take a piece of cardboard, put a thumbtack in it, a little sprig. And then push it in the... That's a tacky button.\n\nL-105 So, they had put it all over. And he had went up there to iron works and got him some stuff, and made a step, to come up. And got some old boxes, and had him a table. And I thought, one day, \"I'll go down and see how they're getting along.\"\n\nL-106 About six months before that, I married E. V. Knight's daughter to E. T. Slider's son. E. V. Knight, one of the richest men there is on the Ohio River, and, oh, runs the great factories through there, making these prefab houses, and so forth. And--and Slider, E. T. Slider, is the sand and gravel company, millionaires' children. And I had married them.\n\nL-107 And I went back in a place, practiced it for about two weeks, and going back in a booth and kneeling on a pillow. And all the pomp and everything I ever went through, nearly, had to go through, to marry that couple! And when they come out, why, they was... This other little couple just stood there in a little old room where we had a little couch and a folded bed, but they both was married by the same ceremony.\n\nL-108 And then, one day, I thought I'd go down and visit this rich couple. They didn't have to work, their fathers were millionaires, had built them a nice home. Frankly, this E. V. Knight, up, here on the hill, his doorknobs are fourteen carat on his big palace, so you can imagine what kind of home they live in. They didn't have to work. They had a nice Cadillac give to them every year. And just, only children, and they had just everything they wanted. When I walked up one day...\n\nL-109 Now, how I got acquainted with them, one of their friends was a good friend of mine. We all kind of chummed together. And that's how I got acquainted, when they wanted me to marry them.\n\nL-110 So I went up to visit them. I got outside my old Ford, outside, and walked up the steps. And--and I got up, a little bit too close, and I heard them. And they were really fussing. They were jealous of one another. They had been to a dance. She was a very pretty girl. And she was kind of one of these beauty queens. She took many prizes around there, and won some cars and things, for being beauty queen. And I looked at them, and one was setting in one corner and one the other, fussing about some boy she had danced with, or some girl, something. 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min\n\nL-111 When I come up, they jumped up real quick and grabbed one another across, floor, and their--their hands, across the floor, come walking over towards the door. Said, \"Why, hello there, Brother Branham! How you getting along?\" Said, \"All right. How you all getting along?\"\n\nL-112 And, \"Oh,\" he said, \"I--I... We're very happy. Aren't we, honey?\" And she said, \"Yes, dear.\" See?\n\nL-113 Now, you see, you're putting on something that isn't real. Now, you can't get warm by a painted fire, like some of these churches trying to paint pentecost, of something that happened a thousand years ago or two thousand years ago. You can't get warm by a painted fire. Pentecost is just as real today as it was then. See? Yeah. The Fire is still falling. It ain't a painted fire. It's a real Fire.\n\nL-114 So, they, just there they was. See? I--I wouldn't want to live like that.\n\nL-115 \"Oh,\" I thought, \"you know, just down over the cliff there and over on the river, there's where this other couple wound up.\" I thought, \"One Saturday afternoon I'd slip down there and see how they was getting along.\"\n\nL-116 So I, dirty on the face, and dirty overalls on, my tools on. I thought, \"I'll slip up on them.\" I slipped on, like I was watching for insulators being cracked by the lightning or something, and as I walked alongside the telephone wire, the electric cables along the river. And there's the old Chevrolet, was setting out front. About a year later, after I had married them. And there was a--a... The door was open, and I could hear them talking. So this sounds like a hypocrite, but I walked up close enough till I could listen, see what they was saying. Stood there. And I just want to know, for myself.\n\nL-117 I like to find out and be sure I know what I'm talking about. That's the way I do about God's Word. Is It the Truth, or isn't It the Truth? Will He keep His Word, or doesn't He keep His Word? He doesn't keep His Word, then He's not God. See? He does keep His Word, He's God. See? [Romans 3:4], [Luke 21:33]\n\nL-118 And so I want to see how they was getting along. And I slipped along the side, real easy. I heard him say, \"Oh, honey, I wanted to get that for you, so bad.\"\n\nL-119 She said, \"Now, look, sweetheart.\" She said, \"This dress is all right.\" She said, \"Why, this is just fine.\" Said, \"I appreciate that. But you see...\"\n\nL-120 I slipped around, so I could look in through the crack, where the door been shoved open there in the boxcar. And there he was, setting in there, and her on his lap; and his arm around her, and her arm around him. And he had one of these old slouch hats, and had put a little hole, mashed it down, the top, and pulled out his pay check, in that. He--he was laying it out on the table. Said, \"So much for groceries. So much for insurance. And so much on the car.\" And they couldn't make their ends meet. Come to find out, he had seen a little dress up there in a window, been looking at it for a couple weeks, that cost a dollar and something. He wanted to get it. Said, \"Well, honey, you'd look so pretty in it.\" And he said...\n\nL-121 She said, \"But, honey, I--I got a dress. I--I don't really need it.\" See? And that little queen...\n\nL-122 I backed off, and looked up. I could see the--the steeple on top of the other house. I stood there and looked, a few minutes. I thought, \"Who is the rich man?\" I thought, \"If, Bill Branham, if you want to take which place, where would you go?\" For me, I'd take not that pretty thing up on top the hill. I'd take this character down here, as a real homemaker, somebody that loved me and stayed with me, somebody tried to make a home; and not bleeding you for everything, for fineries; and somebody that was with you, part of you.\n\nL-123 That's always stuck with me, of how that was. One chose a beautiful girl, the other one chose character. Now, that's the only way you could choose. First, look for character and, then, if you love her. Fine.\n\nL-124 Notice, God's first Adam didn't have any choice, for his wife. He didn't get a choice. God just made him one, and he didn't get to choose her. So we find out that she led him astray from God's Word. He didn't get to pray over the matter. He--he--he isn't like you and I. He didn't get a choice. And again, by doing that, she led him from his rightly position as being a son of God. And she did it by showing him a more modern way of living, something that they really 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min shouldn't have done. But the character of her showed that she was wrong. Her motives and objectives were simply wrong. And persuaded him, by her reasoning, that the modern new light that she had found, which was contrary to God's Word, was a better way to live. [Genesis 2:21-22], [Genesis 3:6]\n\nL-125 And how many women today, and vice versa, men, that could pull a good woman away from God, or pull a good man away from God, by trying to tell him, \"This religion, you pentecostal boy! That religion,\" they say, \"oh, That's old-fashion. It's old fogy. Don't you believe That.\" You better pray hard before you marry that girl. I don't care how pretty she is. Same thing to a man.\n\nL-126 She persuaded him out of the will of God and caused him to do something that he should not have done, and, by it, caused death to the whole human race. That's why the Bible forbids her to teach, or to preach, or to handle God's Word, in any manner. [I Kings 16:30-31], [Ezra 10:1-3], [Nehemiah 13:23-27]\n\nL-127 I know, sister, many of you say, \"The Lord called me to preach.\" I'm not going to argue with you. But I'm going to tell you, the Word says you not to do it. \"She shall not teach, or usurp any authority, but to be in silence.\" \"Well,\" you say, \"the Lord told me to do it.\" [I Corinthians 14:34]\n\nL-128 I don't doubt that one bit. Did you hear my Message the other night about Baalam? Balaam got the first, straight-cut decision of God, \"Don't do it.\" But he kept on fooling around till finally God told him to go do it. [Numbers 22:1-22]\n\nL-129 God might permit you to preach. I don't say He didn't. But it's not according to His original Word and plan. \"For she is to be under obedience, as also saith the law.\" It's true. Therefore, she's not supposed to do it. [I Timothy 2:11-15]\n\nL-130 Now, notice again how the natural bride types the spiritual. The Word says, that, \"She was made for man, and not man made for her.\" [I Corinthians 11:9]\n\nL-131 Now I'm going to speak, and why, in a few minutes, on the Bride of Christ, but I'm trying to show you the background of it.\n\nL-132 \"Woman was made for man, and not man for woman.\" That's the reason, under the old laws, that polygamy was legal. Look at David setting down there with five hundred wives, and the Bible said, \"He was a man after God's own heart.\" With five hundred wives, and Solomon with a thousand, but not one of them women could have another husband. [I Timothy 2:9-15], [Acts 13:22]\n\nL-133 You get my tape on Marriage And Divorce. That, up on top the mountain at Tucson, here not long ago, I was up there praying about it. They dismissed the schools, to watch that Pillar of Fire circle the mountain and go in a funnel, back and forth, up and down. People around here knows it, there and saw It; and it when He told me the Truth of this marriage and divorce, questioned. If there's one side going this way, and one going that way, there's got to be a Truth somewhere. After those Seven Seals, He showed what was the Truth of it.\n\nL-134 Notice, now, she could not have but one husband, because, \"Woman was made for man, and not man for woman.\" That whole five hundred women was just David's wife, and it was a type. When Christ sets on the Throne in the Millennium, His Bride will be not one person, but it'll be tens of thousands, the Bride, all in One. And David had many wives, as individuals, but only all of them together was his wife. Like the whole Body of believers is the Bride of Christ, 'cause It's She, the woman. He was the Man. Now, we were made for Christ. Christ wasn't made for us. [Ephesians 5:23]\n\nL-135 That's what we try to do today in our textbooks, is try to make the Word (which is Christ) suit us, instead of us trying to make ourself to suit the Word. That's the different.\n\nL-136 When a man chooses a certain girl out of a family, he must not rely upon beauty, for beauty is deceiving. And beauty, modern worldly beauty, is of the Devil. \"Oh,\" I hear someone say out there, \"be careful here, preacher!\"\n\nL-137 I say that these things on this earth, that's called beautiful, is absolutely of the Devil. I'll prove it to you. Then, in 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min the light of this remark, let's search God's holy Word, to see if it's right or not. And some of you women wants to be so pretty! See where it comes from. In the beginning, we find that Satan was so beautiful till he deceived Angels. And he was the most beautiful Angel of all of them. Showed, it lays in the Devil. Proverbs said, Solomon said, \"Beauty is vain.\" That's right. Sin is beautiful. Certainly, it is. It's attractive. [Proverbs 31:30]\n\nL-138 I want to ask you, and say something here to you. I want you to notice, a few minute. Of all of the species in the world, birds, animals, we find that on the animal life, all besides human, it's the male that's pretty, and not the female. Why that? Look at the... Look at the deer, the--the beautiful big buck with his horns, and the little muley doe. Look at the--the hen, the little, speckled hen, and the big beautiful-feathered rooster. Look at the male bird and the female bird. Look at the mallard duck and the female. See? And there isn't one specie in the world, that's made, that can deceive and stoop as low as a woman.\n\nL-139 Now, sister, don't get up and go out. Just wait till we hear the end of This. See? See?\n\nL-140 There is nothing, no female besides a woman, could be immoral. You call a dog \"a slut,\" you call a hog \"a--a sow,\" but, morally, they got more morals than half the movie stars there is out here. They cannot be nothing else but moral.\n\nL-141 And the woman was the one that was changed over, for the perversion. That's right. See where the beauty takes her to? Now, that's why that, today, we find that women is on the increase of beauty. You take Pearl O'Brien, you ever see her picture? Supposed to be American's great beauty. There isn't a school kid out of any school but what would have her in a--a back row. Did you know it's supposed to be that way? Did you know the Bible speaks that that's the way it's going to be?\n\nL-142 Do you know the fall came by women at the beginning? And fall... The end is going to wind up the same way, women coming into authority and ruling over men, and so forth. You know the Scripture says that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] You know, the day that she puts on man's clothes, and bobbed her hair, all those things are contrary to God's Word. And you know she represents the church? [\"Yes.\"] When you watch what women are doing, you'll see what the church is doing. That's exactly right. Now, now, that's just as true as the Word of God is true. [I Timothy 2:14], [I Corinthians 11:5-6, 9-10]\n\nL-143 No other female is made that can stoop like a woman can. And yet, through that, being made an off-...\n\nL-144 She was not in the original creation. All other females is in the original creation: bird, male and female; animals, male and female. But, in human life, God only made a man, and He took from him. And a woman is the by-product of a man, because God did not institute such a thing. Search the Scripture. Exactly right. God, no, sir, in His original creation. She was put out there. [Genesis 2:22]\n\nL-145 But if she can hold herself right, what a greater reward she has than man. She's put on a testing ground. Through her come death. She's guilty of all death. But then God turned around and used one to bring Life back again; brought His Son through the woman, an obedient one. But a bad one is the--the worst there is; there's nothing can be as low. [Galatians 4:4]\n\nL-146 Cain, Satan's son, thought that God accepted beauty. He does today. Cain was Satan's son. \"Oh, now!\" you say. We won't go into details on that, but just let me settle it for you. The Bible said that he \"was of that evil one.\" So, that settles it. All right. Now, he was Satan's son. And he thought that, bringing in an altar and making it real pretty for worship, that's what God would respect. [I John 3:12]\n\nL-147 They think, think the same thing today. Certainly. This, \"We build a great building. We'll have great denominations. We'll make the biggest building and the finest-dressed people, the most cultured clergymen.\" Sometimes God is ten million miles from it. That's right. Yet, it's a church.\n\nL-148 So, if God just respects worship, sincerity, sacrifice, Cain was just as just as Abel. But it was by revelation, that he understood that it was not apples that his parents eat. [Hebrews 11:4]\n\nL-149 I'm going to say something here that don't sound good for a minister, but I'm going to say it, anyhow. I hear these other ones saying things, so saying little jokes. I don't mean it. I said this, though, \"If eating apples caused the women 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min to realize they were naked, we had better pass the apples again.\" See? See? Uh-huh. Forgive me for that, but just so that it'll change. I've got you tied up here, and talking about the women, and so forth. I--I--I want to relax you a minute, for what next is to come. Now, notice, you. It was not apples. We know that.\n\nL-150 The church has become in these days, with its achievement, like all other man-made achievement, is becoming scientific. They're trying to make a scientific church, by the attraction of pictures and great steeples. And it's too bad that the Pentecostal got into that rut. You'd be better off with a tambourine, down on the corner, and the Spirit of God around you. But you're trying to compare with the rest of them, because you denominated. That's what did it. See? Churches is trying to be scientifically.\n\nL-151 And remember, as man achieves progress by science, he's killing hisself every day. When he invented gun powder, look what it done. When he invented an automobile, it killed more than the gun powder does. Now he's got hisself a hydrogen bomb. Wonder what he's going to do with that? Right.\n\nL-152 And so is the church, as it tries to achieve by science, by man-made scheme, it's taking you farther away from God, and into death, more than it was at the first place. That's right. Don't choose your church the same way you did your wife. See? What science did for her was a marvel, but you better keep away from your church on that; he made paints, powders, and all these other things. Choose by character of His Word.\n\nL-153 Now let us compare the natural bride of today with the so-called church bride of today. Compare a woman, going to get married today.\n\nL-154 Now, just look what science has done for her. She comes out, first, with her hair chopped off, with one of these Jacqueline Kennedy hairdo's, see, or something like that. And you know what the Bible said? The Bible actually gives a man, if he wants to, the right to put her away in divorcement, if she does that. \"She's a dishonorable woman, that'll cut her hair.\" The Bible said so. Right. Didn't know that? Huh? Oh, yeah! I preach too much in California for you not to know that. That's right. Oh, yeah! What good does it do me? They do it, anyhow. You can't take the pig and change his name, make him a lamb. Notice. [I Corinthians 11:5-6, 15]\n\nL-155 You're going to hate me after this, but you're going to know the Truth. See?\n\nL-156 Look. Let's compare it. Here she comes up with a whole lot of paint, something that she's not, a modern bride. Wash her face, he'd run from her, maybe. Scare you to death, take all that stuff off of her. And so is the church with a big, painted front, a complete theological Max Factor. Uh-huh. Both has a--a beautiful, false face on them, man-made beauty and not God-made beauty. Not much character in either one.\n\nL-157 Notice, just like Satan, enough to deceive by, compare the modern bride now with her: wears shorts, wears paints, cuts off her hair, wears clothes that look like men, and listen to a pastor that told her that was all right. He's a deceiver. He'll suffer for it in the regions beyond. That's right. Doing that to deceive, to be something that she's not.\n\nL-158 That's the way the church does, gets big DD., Ph.D., LL.D. So you say, \"Our pastor is this, that, and the other,\" maybe know no more about God than a Hottentot knows about Egyptian night. That's right. Right. Some theological seminary experience out there, and knows no more about God than nothing.\n\nL-159 Modern church and their theological paint, have their women all with their glory shaved off, by their some ricky and a pastor that they got, like a Jezebel if there ever was one. Bobbed hair, shorts, paints, all fixed up in a theological taste, that's the way the church stand. Right. But her spiritual character is far from that being the homemaker that Jesus Christ is coming to receive. [II Kings 9:30-35]\n\nL-160 If any Christian would marry a woman like that, it shows he's fallen from grace. His taste of God and his taste of a home, what a home ought to be, is far, when he choose a woman like that. No, sir. She sure wouldn't fit a Christian's taste. Her spiritual character is the lowest ebb, dead, in denominational beauty and lust of the world.\n\nL-161 That's exactly where the church stands today, sold her Word-given character to Satan, for a scientific man-made religion. When, she had the right, as a church of God, to stay with the Word of God and have the Holy Spirit working among, welding the Body together with the Word and love of God. Instead of that, she sold out her birthrights, like 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min Esau, and took a denomination, let her do it, anything she wanted to, right, just to be popular like her mother did at Nicaea Rome. God's Word!\n\nL-162 Oh, how it's entered into our Pentecostal realm! It's too bad, but it did it.\n\nL-163 Notice, just a minute, a nun in a Catholic church. That woman, to become a nun, and takes that last veil, she is absolutely sold out to that church. She is (soul, body, and spirit) property of that church. She has no mind of her own. She can't have, when she takes that last veil, no mind of her own, no will of her own. See out here, that Satan makes them his bogus, like the true.\n\nL-164 The true Church of Christ, the Bride, is so sold out to Him and His promised Word, till the very mind that's in Christ is in you. What a different!\n\nL-165 And we find today, that, the modern church, a modern world church. The modern world church and also that the spiritual Church are both pregnated, to give birth to sons.\n\nL-166 One of them, a denominational birth, is going to be give, one day to these days, at the World Council of Churches, which will produce to the world the antichrist, through a denomination. That's exactly the Truth. I may not live to see it. I believe I will. But, you young people, remember that you heard a minister say that. That'll finally wind up. And that is the mark of the beast, when she forms that World Council of Churches. And she'll give birth to her son, the antichrist.\n\nL-167 The other is pregnated by the Word of God and will bring forth the Body, the finished Body of Jesus Christ, which is the Bride. The Body of Christ isn't finished yet. How many knows that? A man and woman is one. And Christ is one Body, the Word. The Bride will have to be the rest of that Body. And the two, together, makes the one Body again. Like Adam was at the beginning: man, his wife, are one. Now, She, the true Bride, so sold out to Him, that She use no mind of Her own. His mind, of course, is His will, and His will is His Word.\n\nL-168 Now look at the so-called bride chosen by man, and compare the spiritual to the natural of today, a modern Jezebel bewitched by her Ahab, Max Factor beauties, everything. Look at the church, the same way, but a prostitute to the Word of the living God; big denominations, big buildings, big money, big salary, all sold out. Men standing in the pulpit endorsing that that's all right, and let them get by with it. Just deceit, that's all. Truly a blind Laodicea Church Age, just exactly what the Bible said would be. \"Said, 'I am rich. I set as a queen. I have need of nothing.' And knowest thou not that you're poor, miserable, blind, wretched, naked: and don't know it.\" If that isn't THUS SAITH THE LORD, Revelations 3, I've never read It. That's what she is, and don't know it! Think of it. [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-169 If you'd tell a man or a woman, on the street, that was stark naked, and tell them they were naked, and they say, \"Tend to your own business,\" why, there's a mental deficiency there somewhere. There is something went wrong with their mind.\n\nL-170 And when you can read the Word of God, how that people should do, and this baptism of the Holy Ghost that we have today, and, people, why, they look at you as if you were crazy. You tell them, \"You've got... They got to be born again. They got to believe the Bible.\"\n\nL-171 They say, \"That was a Jewish fable, for years ago. Our church has the way.\" Wretched, miserable, blind, naked, and don't even know it. What a... And the Bible said that that's the condition they get into. How could a true prophet ever miss seeing it? I don't know. [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-172 Drifting right into all of our churches, everywhere. Just look at it, just in the modern trend. \"The old whore and daughters,\" of Revelations 17, giving to the \"poor, blind, miserable\" people her doctrine of theology contrary to the Word of God. \"And they found in her the souls of slaves, and men and women of--of everywhere.\" Instead of attracting the people... [Revelation 17:4-6]\n\nL-173 Christ does vindicates His Word, which attracts the people. He don't attract the people at churches that are attracted by big denominations and big doings, and great big carry-on's and fancy things. But the Word of God attracts the Bride of Christ.\n\nL-174 Now notice. It's interesting to--to notice how that--that the church tries to attract the attention of the people by 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min fine robes and dressed choirs, and bobbed-haired women and painted faces. And they think... And it sang like an Angel. Lie like a devil, run around all night to a dance like, think nothing about it. And that's what they think, \"It's all right. That's beautiful.\" But, you see, that's false-made. That's not the Word of God.\n\nL-175 While, the true Bride attracts the attention of God, by keeping His Word. Now notice. Now let us notice Christ.\n\nL-176 You say, \"Well, now, wait a minute, what about this beauty you're talking about?\"\n\nL-177 The Bible said, in Isaiah 53:2, that, when Jesus come, \"There was no beauty of Him, that we should desire Him.\" That right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] There's no beauty. If He would have come in the worldly beauty, as Satan is today, the people would have run around Him and accept Him the way they do the church today. They would have believed Him, received Him, as they do Satan today. Certainly, they would. But He didn't come in that kind of a beauty, but He always comes in the beauty of character. There, Christ wasn't a beautiful, great, strong, stout Man. God doesn't choose that kind. [Isaiah 53:2]\n\nL-178 I remember one time a prophet went up to--to take a king, to make a king out of Jesse's son, to take another king's place, Saul. And so Jesse brought him out, his great, big, fine boy. He said, \"The crown will look right, on his head.\"\n\nL-179 The prophet went to pour the oil on him. He said, \"God has refused him.\" And He refused every one of them, till he come to a little, old stoop-shouldered, ruddy-looking fellow. And he poured the oil upon him, and he said, \"God chose him.\" See? We choose by sight. God choose by character. [I Samuel 16:7, 12]\n\nL-180 Character, there never was a character like Jesus Christ. It lives in you and manifests Him. We see it's true. It's not worldly beauty of Him that attracts His Bride. It is His character, the character of the Church, that Jesus looks for; not where it's big buildings, where it's great denominations, where it's big membership. He promised to meet with wherever two or three are gathered together. Truly. That's where the true believer rests his hopes, is upon that Word of God being vindicated in Truth, what is. Choose by His Word, not a worldly-loving group. They hate that.\n\nL-181 No wonder she is divorced from Him, because she's missed His revelation, and she don't have it. He cares not for her, the way she acts and does, and how much of this worldly stuff she has.\n\nL-182 He's looking for her character, the character of Christ. Now, just a moment now. That's it. He chooses a Bride to reflect His character, to which the modern churches of today certainly misses His--His program here, a million miles, 'cause they deny This to be the Truth. So how could it be? Now, He's looking for the day for that Bride to be formed, Hebrews 13:8, just exactly like It was, like He was. It's got to be His same flesh, same bones, same Spirit, same everything, just exactly built up, and them two then become one. Until the church becomes that, they're not one. The character of Him, the Word, for this age, must be molded. She must be molded like He is. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-183 Now, in closing, I want to say the reason that I said these things, and I'll--I'll close. The other night, about three o'clock in the morning, I was awakened up.\n\nL-184 I take any of you to answer this. Have I ever told you anything in the Name of the Lord but what it was right? It's always been right. [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] So help me, God knows that's true. There is no one, nowhere in the world, of the thousands of things that's been told, that He has ever missed one word of it. Always been perfectly come to pass.\n\nL-185 Even to when I was at Phoenix, the other day, or about a year ago it was, and told you about that Message on--on What Time Is It, Sirs? And told you, \"Seven Angels would meet out there,\" and be the opening of these Seals, and what. And there the--the Life magazine packed the article of it, this great Flame going up in the air, thirty miles high, twenty-seven miles across. They said they couldn't make out what it was; don't know yet. And men setting right here in this building tonight, was standing right there with me when it happened, just exactly what It said. He told me the things was coming to pass, and happened just exactly. How each of those Seals opened, and told the mysteries that had been hid down through them ages of the reformers and so forth, just perfectly.\n\nL-186 How, standing up on top the hill, men, three or four of them standing right here present now, yes, more than that. Going up the hill, the Holy Spirit said, \"Pick up that rock.\" We were hunting. He said, \"Throw it up in the air, and say, 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min 'THUS SAITH THE LORD.'\" I did. Down from there come a little funnel of wind. I said, \"Within twenty-four hours, you'll see the hand of God.\" Men setting right here present now.\n\nL-187 The next day, about ten o'clock, standing there, I said, \"Get ready. Get under the car there,\" a veteran. I said, \"Something is fixing to happen.\" It was a clear sky, right up in a big canyon. Down come a whirling Fire from Heaven, just as hard as It could scream, hit the walls like that. I--I was standing right under It. I took off my hat, held my head. It come about three feet or four feet above me, and cut a ditch plumb around that wall like that, and blasted. And went back up in the air, and whirled around again, and come down, three times, even had cut the tops of mesquite bushes out, for two hundred yards. Hear them fellows saying, \"Amen\"? They were there when it happened, see, and made three blasts.\n\nL-188 When they got out from under the cars and everything, come back over, said, \"That would hit you, there wouldn't been a greasy spot.\"\n\nL-189 I said, \"It was--It was Him. He was talking to me.\" God speaks by a whirlwind. See? And there was that same Pillar of Fire that you see on the picture, standing there. And when It went up, they said, \"What is it?\" I said, \"Judgment is striking the West Coast.\"\n\nL-190 Second day from there, Alaska like to sunk. See? It struck once, there, the first blow.\n\nL-191 Where, you have to do something, to symbolize it. Like a man put some salt in a cruse, and throwed it in the water, and said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD, let there be sweet water.\" And another one, Jesus picked up water and poured it into a jug, and--and made wine out of it.\n\nL-192 You have to have something, to symbolize. That's what that was, that went up in the air and come down. That started that little whirlwind. Within twenty-four hours, It had shook that mountain till it cut a ridge around it.\n\nL-193 Rev. Mr. Blair sitting here, I'm looking right at him now, he was up there and picked up some of the pieces of it, and so forth. Here is Terry Sothmann, them, and standing here, and Billy Paul. And brothers, some of many of these others setting in here, that was right there to see it happen when It tore it out.\n\nL-194 That's not fiction. That's the truth. That wasn't back in the Bible days. That's now. See? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] That same God that's always showed me these things, and they've come to pass, exactly to the letter. Never have they failed one time. Now I'm bragging on Him.\n\nL-195 A few weeks ago, I was in a vision. And I was standing up on a--a high place, and I was to see the preview of the Church. And I noticed, coming from my... I was standing more like this way, facing the West. And coming this way was the lovely bunch of women, real nice dress, long hair fixed nice in the back, sleeves, and skirts down neatly. And they were all in a marching tune, like, \"Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, with the cross of Jesus going on before.\" And as they passed by, I stood, and there was Something there, some Spirit, was God, and said, \"There is the Bride.\" And I looked, and my heart was happy. And She went around this way, and passed around behind me.\n\nL-196 After while, when she come back this way, It said, \"Now the modern church will come into preview.\" And here come the Asian church up. I never seen such a filthy bunch.\n\nL-197 Here come the other churches up, of the different nation. They looked horrible.\n\nL-198 And I--I say this because I'm duty bound to tell the truth, before God. And when He said, \"Here comes the church of America now, to be previewed.\" If I ever seen a bunch of devils, it was that. Them women were stripped naked, with an old gray-looking thing, like a color of an elephant's hide. And they was holding it in front of them, with no upper part on it at all. And they were doing this kind of stuff, that, these--these dances that these kids do out here, that twist and stuff, and that kind of music going on. And when I seen Miss U.S.A. come up, I almost fainted.\n\nL-199 Now, this is THUS SAITH THE LORD. You believe me to be His servant. You believe me now. I wouldn't say that for nothing in the world. There's not enough money in all the world to get me to say that if it wasn't true.\n\nL-200 And when she come by, that was the filthiest-looking thing I ever seen. I thought, \"God, as hard as preachers and 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min we brethren have labored to get You a Bride, and that's the best we could do.\" She was twisting, holding this in front of her, like one of these hula skirts of a thing, holding it in front of her parts, her lower part, like this, dancing and twisting like these kids do out here on the... on these vulgar shows that they have, twisting. That was Miss Christianity of America.\n\nL-201 So help me, by the help of God, that's what it looks like in His face. I--I just... I start... I could have fainted. I thought, \"All the trying, and the preaching, and the persuading?\" Every one of them with bobbed hair, and they were twisting and carrying on, holding this in front. They come around, where I was standing there with this supernatural Being. I couldn't see Him. I'd hear Him talking to me; was right around me. But when they turned this way, they hold this. And just twisting and laughing and going on, carrying on like that, holding this in front of them.\n\nL-202 Now, me standing in His Presence there, and His servant. \"And of all I tried, that's the best I could do?\" I thought, \"God, what good did it do me? What good did it do? All the crying, and begging, and persuading, and the great signs and wonders and miracles that You showed. And how I stood there, and go home and cry after preaching to them and things, and what good did it do me? And then I have to present something like that for You, for a Bride?\"\n\nL-203 And as I stood there, looking, she passed on by. And you can imagine the back part of her, with nothing on, holding this in front of her as she went shimmying by, like that, to this twist, throwing her limbs out like that. And, her, oh, it was vulgar, how she was carrying on, her body shaking around like that. Now I...\n\nL-204 You say, \"What does it mean, Brother Branham?\" I don't know. I'm just telling you what I seen.\n\nL-205 And when she passed by like that, I looked at her. Oh, I just got real faint. I just turned around. I thought, \"God, I'm condemned. There--there's no need of me trying any now. Just might as well quit.\"\n\nL-206 Mrs. Carl Williams, if you're setting here, and that dream that you told me about, a while ago, that you had the other night, that's been bothering you, there it is. The steering wheel is taken from my hand.\n\nL-207 Then, I just thought, \"I--I just might as well forget it.\" I was gone.\n\nL-208 Then, all at once, I heard It coming again. And coming up on this side come the same Bride that went around this a way. Here come them little ladies again, and each one of them was dressed in their national garb from where they come from, like Switzerland, Germany, and so forth, each one wearing that kind of garb, all long hair, just exactly like the one at the first. And here they was coming, walking. \"Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war.\" And when they passed by the preview stand where we were standing, just all at once, every eye went that way. And then they turned back, and on they went, marching, and just as they started to going right up into the sky.\n\nL-209 This other one went up to a brink of a hill and went down, like that.\n\nL-210 These started marching right up into the sky. And when they went to marching, I noticed a couple of little girls in the back, looked like they might be of some foreign girl, like Sweden or Switzerland, or somewhere. They started to look around, and got... I said, \"Don't do that! Don't get out of that step!\" And as I screamed like that, I come to, in the vision, standing there with my hand out like that. I thought, \"Well...\"\n\nL-211 That's the reason I said what I have, tonight. I want to ask you a question. Is it later that we think? Could She already be called and chosen, sealed away? There won't be one extra one, you know. Could it be possible? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.\n\nL-212 Remember what I said, other day at the breakfast. In the pollen of breeding male and female, there's a million germs goes forth, million eggs goes forth. But there's only one of them live, and, yet, they're every one just alike: one out of a million. Every one of them, the same egg and the same kind of germ. One of them lives. The rest of them die.\n\nL-213 No one can tell which is the one that's a ripe egg, and, oh, what about it. God has to decide that, whether it's going to be a boy or girl, blond or brunette, or whatever it's going to be. God decides that. Not the first one meets, but the first one God has decide. Maybe one come up here, and one... If you ever noticed, in the test tube, to see them come together. I've watched it. God has to decide that. One, every one of them, just alike, but by election. The natural birth is by election. God takes one out of the million. 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min\n\nL-214 When Israel left Egypt, on their road to the promised land, they were approximately two million people. Every one of them was under the same sacrificial lamb, or they wouldn't have lived. Every one of them listened to Moses, the prophet. Every one of them was baptized to him, in the Red Sea. Every one of them danced, the women with Miriam, up-and-down the side of (when) the seashore, when God destroyed the enemy. Every one of them stood with Moses, and heard him sing in the Spirit. They, every one, eat manna out of the wilderness, that dropped down from Heaven. New manna, every night, which is a type of the Message, every one of them eat from it. But, out of the two million, how many made it? Two. One out of a million.\n\nL-215 There's approximately five hundred million Christians in the world tonight, counting Catholic and all. Five hundred million so-called believers in the world. If the Rapture come tonight, that would mean... if one out of a million was the count. I don't say it is. But if it was, five hundred people, in the next twenty-four hours, would be missing. You'd never even hear of it. There'll be that many missing, anyhow, can't even be counted for.\n\nL-216 Then it could be, happen to us, friend, like it did when John the Baptist came. Even the disciples said, \"Why did the Scriptures say, why do the--the apostles or the prophets say, why does it say that Elias must first come and restore all things?\" [Matthew 17:10]\n\nL-217 He said, \"I say unto you that Elias has already come, and you didn't know it.\" [Matthew 17:12]\n\nL-218 One of these days we could be left setting here, \"What about the Rapture before the tribulation sets in?\" \"It's already come and you didn't know it.\"\n\nL-219 All the Body, sealed in, just keeping It in step. I ain't saying it's that way. I hope it isn't that way. But, friend, when it lets...\n\nL-220 If we got a feel in our heart, tonight, that we should straighten up our lives, and the things that we have done, let me advise you, as a minister brother. I'm going to say this for my first time, over the pulpit. I've stretched out farther tonight, on This, than I have on anything else, any time, anyhow, before the public, because I've had a great freedom in these meetings. If you believe me to be God's prophet, you listen to what I've told you. If there's one little tinkle of feeling in your heart, you go to God right now. You do it.\n\nL-221 Stop just a minute, men. Look at your--your creeds that you serve. Look in your churches. Is it just exactly with the Word of God? Have you met every qualification? Say, \"I'm a good man.\" So was Nicodemus, and so was all the rest. They--they were fine. See? That don't have nothing to do with It.\n\nL-222 And, women, I want you to look in the mirror, and look what God requires a woman to do. And see in God's mirror, not in your church mirror now, in God's mirror; and see if you could qualify, in your life, the spiritual Bride of Jesus Christ.\n\nL-223 Ministers, think the same. Do you cut corners here, to save somebody's feelings over yonder? Would you do this if it wasn't... and they'll put you out of the church? If you are feeling that way, my dear brother, let me warn you, in the Name of Jesus Christ, flee from that right now.\n\nL-224 And, lady, if you can't measure up to the qualification of a Christian, not as a nominal Christian; but in your heart, and your life is patterned exactly like God's marriage certificate here says it has to be.\n\nL-225 And, church member, if your church isn't like that, can measure up to God's qualification of His Word, get out of it and get into Christ.\n\nL-226 That is solemn warning. We don't know what time, and you don't know what time, that this city one day is going to be laying out here in the bottom of this ocean.\n\nL-227 \"Oh, Capernaum,\" said Jesus, \"thou who exalted into heaven, will be brought down into hell. For, if the mighty works had been done in Sodom and Gomorrah, it'd have been standing to this day.\" And Sodom, Gomorrah lays in the bottom of the Dead Sea. And Capernaum is in the bottom of the sea. [Matthew 11:23]\n\nL-228 Thou city, who claims to be the city of the Angels, who has exalted yourself into heaven, and sent all the dirty, filthy things of fashions and things, till even the foreign countries come here to pick up our filth and send it away, to 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min your fine churches and steeples, and so forth, the way you do. Remember, one day you'll be laying in the bottom of the sea, your great honeycomb under you right now. The wrath of God is belching right beneath you. How much longer He will hold this sandbar hanging out over that? When, that ocean out yonder, a mile deep, will slide in there, plumb back to the Salton Sea. It'll be worse than the last day of Pompeii. Repent, Los Angeles.\n\nL-229 Repent, the rest of you, and turn to God. The hour of His wrath is upon the earth. Flee while there's time to flee, and come into Christ. Let us pray.\n\nL-230 Dear God, when, in my spirit, is shaking, my heart is dropping teardrops of warning. Grant, O God, that men and women will not think of what I've said as a joke, and the church people will not think of it as something that was prejudice or against them. May they see, Lord, it's in love.\n\nL-231 Thou barest me record, Almighty God, that up-and-down this coast I've went, year after year, proclaiming Your Word. Bear me record, O God, if it would happen tonight, I've told the Truth. Thou knowest this vision of the Bride is the Truth. I've took Your Name by it, Lord, and said it was THUS SAITH THE LORD. And I feel that I'm conscious, Lord, of what I'm doing.\n\nL-232 So I pray Thee, Lord, in Jesus' Name, let people shake themselves, tonight, and flee from the wrath that is to come, for Ichabod is wrote over the doors and over the nations. A black check mark has come across it. The Spirit of God is grieved away from it, and they're weighed in the balances and found wanting. The feast of King Nebuchadnezzar has repeated again, with drunken parties and half-dressed women, calling themselves Christians. [Daniel 5:27]\n\nL-233 O God of Heaven, have mercy upon a sinful world and a sinful people, Lord, as we are tonight. God, I'm trying to stand in the breach and ask for Divine mercy, that You'll speak into this crowd tonight and call Your Bride to attention, Lord, to march not by the sign of any creed, but by the sound of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Grant it, O God. Let it be known, this night, that Thou art God, and Thy Word is Truth. While, solemnly, in the face of this people, we call them to attention of Thy Word.\n\nL-234 In the Name of Jesus Christ, I pray for them, Lord. They have seen You, beyond any shadow of doubt, move across their crowds and tell them what's in their heart. And Thou knowest, Lord, that, right now, what's going on. Thou knowest that to be Truth, O God. And I pray Thee, in Jesus' Name, let the Holy Spirit intercede again, Lord, and pull from this audience, Lord, those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life. Grant it, O God. I pray with all my heart.\n\nL-235 These people, naturally, Lord, would give me the last penny they had, to support the Message. They'd do anything that they could. But, O God, when it comes to coping with It, and coming into It, I pray, God, that this will be the night that You'll reward them and pour down Your Holy Spirit upon this convention. And may there not be a frolic or jumping around, but a weeping and a crying, and a repenting, holding onto the horns of the altar, while we see judgments roaring beneath us, tonight. Grant it, God. I pray as sincerely as I know how, in the Name of Jesus Christ.\n\nL-236 My brother, sister, I--I don't know what more to say, if I found grace in your sight, by the power of God, if you believe me to be His prophet. This is the first time in public I've ever said that. But I feel a strange warning of some sort. I'm not prone to this. You know I'm not. I don't act like this. I hesitated to speak that Message and say those things. I run sideways and everything else, to keep from doing it. But It's been said, and It'll stand at the Day of the Judgment, as a witness that I've told the Truth. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD GOD!...?...\n\nL-237 Oh, Pentecost, run for your life. Flee to the horns of the altar and cry out, before it's too late, for an hour will come when you can cry and it'll do no good. For Esau sought to find a place, of his birthright, and couldn't find it. I commit you, oh, California. Oh, convention of the Full Gospel Business Men, who I love, who I've left and strung to, with all my heart, I commit you to Jesus Christ, tonight. Flee to Him! Don't let the Devil ever cool you off from This. Stay right with It until you're, every one, filled with the Holy Ghost, insomuch, that will make you come to this Word, that will make you women straighten up, that will make you men straighten up. If you'd say you've got the Holy Ghost, and won't cope with the Word, it's another spirit in you. God's Spirit is on His Word, the Messianic, the anointed Word. 65-0429E, The Choosing Of A Bride, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 101 min The Bride must be a Messiah-ette, the anointed Word.\n\nL-238 Let us stand to our feet, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. If you never hear my voice again... But, God willing, I'm setting to Africa, in a few hours. I may never return. I don't know. But I tell you, with all my heart, I've told you the Truth. I haven't shunned to declare to you everything that God has told me to say. And I've said It in the Name of the Lord. [Acts 20:27]\n\nL-239 It's a solemn moment. I don't know how to express it. I've tried to leave the pulpit three or four times, and I can't do it. This is a solemn hour. Don't you never forget it. This is the time that, maybe, God may be making His last call. I don't know. He'll make His last call, some day. When? I don't know. But I'm telling you, according to that vision, it looks like that that Bride is about finished. Look at the nominal churches coming in. When the sleeping virgin come for Oil, she failed to get It. The Bride went in. The Rapture went up. \"While they went to buy Oil, the Bridegroom come.\" [Matthew 25:12]\n\nL-240 Are you asleep? Wake up, quickly, and come to yourself. And let us pray, each one, like we were dying at this minute, in the Name of the Lord. Let's, each one, pray in your own way. [Matthew 25:6, 10]\n\nL-241 God Almighty, have mercy upon us. Lord, have mercy on me. Have mercy upon us all. What good does it do, no matter what we do, if we fail in these things? I stand and ask for mercy, O God, before this great city sinks beneath the sea and judgments of God sweep this coast. I pray, God, that You'll call Your Bride. I commit them to You now, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

It's good to be here this morning. And I think I made a... I am an intruder on Brother Neville's time. Sitting back there with his, getting his text together; and I walked in, he started folding up his text, and said, \"Well...\"\n\nL-2 It reminds me of years ago. There used to be a colored brother down here, named Brother Smith, and Sister Cross. They were very good friends of mine. And when I'd walk in the building at night, the old fellow used... He had a white mustache. Don't know whether any of you remember him, or not. And he would be on the platform, you know. And all of them would be singing, \"It's A Highway To Heaven.\" And Brother Smith, he just sit like this, you know. And I would walk in the back door.\n\nL-3 There was a little girl, kind of real dark, she used to sit in the corner. She'd start clapping her hands, saying, \"Lift Him up,\" that song, you know. They put their own melody to it, you know. And then over in the next corner, be somebody else, says, come in again, \"Lift Him up.\" Well, that's what they'd sing when I come in the door. I just love that bunch of people.\n\nL-4 And so old Brother Smith sit back there, a little bit, you know, and he was kind of a quiet sort of a fellow. He would say, \"Come in, elder, rest your hat.\" Not \"rest yourself\"; \"rest your hat,\" see. \"Come in, elder, rest your hat.\" He would get up there, and, I could tell the way he started off, I was in for it, see.\n\nL-5 He would say, \"Well,\" he says, \"children, you know,\" he said, \"I--I was sitting here just wondering, 'Lord, what You going to give me to say?'\" Said, \"He--He--He kept shaking His head at me, 'I ain't going to give you nothing to say.'\" Said, \"I seen Elder Branham walk in back there, and I said, now, 'Lord, I just begin to remember... '\" Well, I was right in for it!\n\nL-6 Brother George Wright, how are you, brother? [Brother Wright says, \"Oh, good. Sure.\"--Ed.] Bless you, Brother Wright! Certainly. [\"Brother Elijah is back there.\"] Oh, is that right? Brother Elij' Perry, he said, is back here. Where you at, Brother Elij'? I haven't seen him in a long... Well, my, goodness! Now we ought to have a real meeting here! Elij' Perry, George Wright, and some of them old timers that used to be here when you almost had to hold the shutters on the place, with our hands, the wind blowing. Good seeing you! Mother, Sister Wright with you? Sister Wright in? She is back there, too. Yes, sir. Well, how fine! Sister Perry, I see them all now. Well, that's really fine. Good to be in. It's good to sit in these places. It's good to be together.\n\nL-7 I had planned on, so hard, coming back; burdened in the heart. I just returned from Africa, as you all know. And when I got over there, I had a restricted visa, and wouldn't let me, wouldn't let me preach because it gathers too many together. They're expecting an uprise there at any time, and--and they--they wouldn't let me preach because of that gathering too many people together. The only way I could, would to have some organization that's represented by the government, in the government, to invite me over, then that would automatically let the government send out a militia for protection. See, they're just... There is just going to be an uprise, and that's all there is to it. It's just right in hand, see. That government man said, \"The last time he was here, he had about a quarter of a million people together.\" And he said, \"Then, you see, that would just be the very thing that communism is looking for, for an uprise.\" So, I couldn't preach.\n\nL-8 Those people standing there, waving their hands, and crying, \"Remember my mother! Remember, my brother died! My...\" There, and in behind a bar, you know, bars of wire, and it just made you feel real bad. And I come back home.\n\nL-9 And I thought, \"Well...\" My son, Joseph, back there, had let down a little bit in his reading. And he had... He passed all right, but he had to take it over; wasn't reading good enough. So I thought, \"Well, we're going to have to stay home a little while.\" And I said, \"If we stay home, it's going to ruin the kids' vacation.\" See we just postponed it, and taken him over to another part in August, and let... and come back here for a couple, three weeks. 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min\n\nL-10 I said, \"I believe, while we're back there, I'll just take and hold a meeting. We'll get that school auditorium up here, and--and we'll have a meeting from the twenty-eighth on through to the first, a meeting at the school auditorium. I wanted to preach on the subject of the outpouring of them seven last Vials.\" And so we called ahead, and we had a little disappointment. They won't let us have these schools no more, too many people crowds in. We can't have it nowhere. And so then I decided, while I was back here then, instead of... [Revelation 16:1]\n\nL-11 We can't put all the people, if we'd adver-... It's never been advertised, now. So if we put all the people, try to put them in the Tabernacle here, we couldn't do it. See, it just... five days in here would be awful.\n\nL-12 So, sitting in there talking with Brother Neville and Brother Woods, and them, we have decided to do this. If we can't, instead, that would make us have five services; that would be twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, thirtieth, thirty-first, and first. Well, I feel if we have, beginning next Sunday, we can have two services, Sunday morning and Sunday night, that's the eighteenth. And then on the--on the twenty-fifth, have Sunday morning and Sunday night. That's four services. Then on August the first, have a Sunday morning and Sunday night. That would give us six services, and then it won't make such a jam to get the people in. And I think that.\n\nL-13 Don't you think that would be better than having everybody just crowded and mashed together, and everything? Then just that for them two services, we can put up with that, but everybody kind of pull together. For five nights, straight, it would make it hard.\n\nL-14 And I want to get with the trustees and the elders here, while I'm here.\n\nL-15 This is becoming everywhere. We're living in these last days, to where the Gospel does not have the--the premises as It should have. It don't have the rights that It should have. It's all sewed up in politics and things, and just like a union. And that's what it's finally coming to, because the mark of the beast has to come by union, we know. So we--we... Cause, it's a boycott, \"no man can buy or sell, save him that have the mark of the beast.\" [Revelation 13:17]\n\nL-16 And now I want to find out, through the elders. I feel led. I've never had such a hunger in my heart for God, in all my life, than I have now, see. For... And I--I want to get my own tent and my--my stuff, like the Lord gave me a vision to, and I believe the time is just now at hand. And I want to see while I'm here, why we can't get the tent.\n\nL-17 And--and then when we go, like come here to Jeffersonville, instead of having just a day or two, or three or four days, we can go out here and put up this tent, and have two or three weeks, you see, and nobody can say nothing about it. We can either take a ball park, or, if they won't let us have that, there is farmer out here will let us have a farm. We'll rent the farm and--and put it up. The only thing we'd just have to do there, would be make our--our outbuildings, and so forth, and for our conveniences. And that could be easily done. And then we'll start having our services like that because that's according to a vision from the Lord, and it's to be done that way. [Habakkuk 2:3]\n\nL-18 And coming in, yesterday, and finding, you know, this, that. And was going up the street, and a good friend of mine going along there, said, \"Hello, Billy.\" I looked at him, and snow-white hair, that much tummy. And the boy is my age. We run around together, handsome young fellow, when I was a kid. It kind of made me feel funny. My little son, Joseph, said, \"Why you sad, Daddy?\" \"Oh,\" I said, \"I can't explain it to you, Joseph. See, I can't, can't tell you.\"\n\nL-19 And I look at Elij' Perry sitting back there, and Mrs. Perry; seem like yesterday they were a little black-headed couple out there, living next door to me, when we had the old boat, Wahoo, and down on the river and fished at night. See them both white-headed, you know, it says one thing, it's a little buzzer that comes on, \"You ain't got much more time.\" See?\n\nL-20 So, I want every day of my life to count for Him. What I have left, what time I have, I want to spend it somewhere doing something, if it's no more than stand on a street corner, testifying to the glory and honor of God. And I--I'm here for that purpose.\n\nL-21 And I've got a little secret place up here at Green's Mill, Indiana. It's not a city, now, it's--it's a wilderness. And some people has taken it over, and they don't even let you set a foot on it. But I got a cave there that he would never 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min find me when I got into it. I go at nighttime, and he'll never know when I go in or come out. And he don't know where the cave is, and couldn't get to it no matter where it was. And I want to go over and talk to the Lord, a while, I feel that it's a necessity.\n\nL-22 The wife, she wants to come, want to come back and visit around, and Rebekah and Sarah, and them, with their friends. And we're back here now for the next three weeks, and if the Lord willing.\n\nL-23 And I think, instead of trying to jam the people all together, for them meetings here in the Tabernacle... Course, this belongs to us, belongs to the Lord, give it to us. And it's air-conditioned. Like to have a Sunday morning service, a Sunday night service. That would let people go back to their place, then wait over until the next coming week.\n\nL-24 I don't think I could take and--and officially do justice to the pouring out of those last Vials, 'cause they're very, very great Message in that. But I could pray for the sick, and do things that... I have Messages, too, as the Lord will give them to me, for the church. Through the week, I'll get out here in the wilderness somewhere and study, come back on Sunday morning, have Sunday morning service like this, and a Sunday night service. Our most gracious little pastor, Brother Neville, I asked him if that would be satisfaction to him. That's taking all of his services away from him, but he was more than glad to surrender it to--to over to that. I just...\n\nL-25 Brother Capps, he, I guess, got the roaming fever, too, and I see he has left, and--and Brother Humes. And the Lord had a Brother Mann here just to take right over, and the place. You know, isn't that wonderful how God will do things? He always has everything timed just right. I come up and I heard somebody preaching. I said, \"That don't... I believe...\" [Ecclesiastes 3:1]\n\nL-26 Brother Capps, he come to Tucson, and I think it bluffed him right quick, it was about a hundred and ten degrees. He didn't want nothing to do with that, so away he went, him and Brother Humes, and went up to Phoenix. Course, it's a hundred and fifteen to sixteen, eighteen up there. That was still worse, so I think he took off to Texas after that; he, trying to find a place.\n\nL-27 But you don't want no Arizona this time of year, I tell you. It was a hundred and forty, the other day, last Friday, a hundred and forty degrees, at Parker. And that's where Brother Craig, from the church here, lives. And you can break an egg, and it'll fry before it hits the ground. [Brother Branham laughs--Ed.] You, you spit and--and the moisture is gone, it just... There is no humidity nor nothing, it's really a bake oven this time of year. But from about November, December and January, wonderful. But when it comes about March and April, you better get away if you don't want to suffocate.\n\nL-28 And so Brother Capps and them happened to come just at that time, which I think run them out. So maybe the Lord did that for a purpose. I'm believing this, that God orders the footsteps of the righteous. Sometimes it seems hard. [Psalms 37:23]\n\nL-29 Like the other day on this trip to Africa, I was so sure that I was moving in the will of God. Because, a year ago, I was down in the South, holding a series of meetings, and, they--they, I thought...\n\nL-30 Coming from that organization, said, \"You can come on, through the Christian Business Men, but we'll have nothing to do with it.\"\n\nL-31 Well, I don't want to throw them man right in on it, you know, make conflict. I--I want to make them feel good at one another. So I just said, \"Well...\" Wrote them a letter, I said, \"Remember, I have tried to get into Africa for years, again, feeling that my ministry isn't finished in Africa. I have no...\"\n\nL-32 Why would I have to go to Africa, when I got six, seven hundred cities right here in the United States, calling, see, just right here, without leaving Canada, Mexico, or any of those places? Why should I want to go there? But it's something in my heart, that pulls me to Africa. There, those people, there--there is something about them, that I love, and I want to go just for the colored people only. And there is something in a lot of them, them leaders, they don't feel I should do that. I--I want to go to my colored friends. That's where the Lord called me. And now they're needy. Many of those people, those white people, can have doctors and everything. But them poor natives live out there, and half rot. I--I--I feel they're the ones that looks like they would receive It. They're the ones. There is something about it. 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min\n\nL-33 When you get to a spot, you're so smart that you know everything, then God can't do nothing with you. But if you get to a place that you're willing to listen and learn, then--then it's God's time, can move in and talk to you.\n\nL-34 And so I wrote them a letter back, and told them. And I said, \"Remember, at the Day of the Judgment, let them boney hands reach out of the smoke, condemn you! Their blood be upon you, not on me, 'cause I've tried for about ten years to get back.\"\n\nL-35 Then when I mailed the letter, come back, Something said to me, \"See Sidney Jackson, take a hunting trip.\" And, the same time, the Lord spoke to Sidney Jackson, said, \"Yellow-mane lion, Brother Branham camping; Durban, big meeting.\"\n\nL-36 Well, he was over here, and he spoke with you here. By the way, we baptized... He was firmly against this baptism in the Name of Jesus Christ. And his wife was worse than he was, she would just walk away. You could... I'm telling you, I never seen any more devout people. They've got about a hundred and fifty ministers over there, baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, and they're just burning the country up. The Message is just sweeping Africa, everywhere, aviators and great man coming, being baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-37 And so I, when I started to go over, I'm telling you, I never had so much trouble in all my life, of trying to get there. And then at the very last minute, very last minute to go, here was wrote across my visa, \"Cannot anticipate in any kind of religious service; can only come hunting.\" Well, then, it was rank.\n\nL-38 But I said, \"I don't care what the Devil does, I--I can't... I can't voucher for what Brother Jackson said about yellow-mane lion, and this, that, or the other. I--I can't vouch it. But I do know God told me to 'see Sidney Jackson, and go hunting.'\"And I said, \"I'm going.\" And sometime... And I had one of the greatest trips.\n\nL-39 I found out what the trouble was. Now I think, about October, the Lord willing, I can go back and have a meeting and everything, full cooperation, everything else, see, in Africa now. I got to the bottom of it and found out where it was at, what caused it. Up here, writing, this one has got this to say, and something's got something to say, and this one there. The best thing to do, is go find out, yourself. And I know where the trouble was, and what the reason of it was; it was because of so many people gathering together, the government wouldn't let me have it.\n\nL-40 Now if the Christian Business Men or any organization, which will bring us in, then the government automatically... because it's the organization is represented with the government, the government sends militia protection. If there would be twenty-five man out of one denomination, twenty-five out of another, still they won't receive that. It's got to be the--the head of this organization. And Christian Business Men is a nonsectarian organization representing all the churches. Doctor Simon, their head over there, a very fine man, I got to meet him and talk with him. And they are taking the meetings, and all the rest of the churches is coming in together. See? And I believe we'll have one of the greatest meetings that's been had in--in Africa.\n\nL-41 But my point was this, when you know that you--you're trying to do what's right. The first thing is, if you feel led to do anything, then check it with the Word and see if it's right with the Word, and then let nothing stop you. I don't care how many wheels the Devil throws in our way, just move right over the top of them. [I Thessalonians 2:18]\n\nL-42 I told my wife and I told Brother Wood, when I got here, and some friends that I met yesterday. I have had about five years here that I hardly knowed what to do. It's been a--a nervous... See, the revival itself, amongst the churches, had died. Everyone knows that. You feel it in this Tabernacle. You feel it everywhere. There is a thump, dead feeling. There is just something isn't right. It's because the revival enthusiasm has gone away from the people. Go into the churches, you'll see them sitting there. And the pastor is stumbling around for a message and something another. And the first thing you know, he turned it off on some kind of a party they're going to have, or something. It seems to be a dead thump everywhere.\n\nL-43 Billy Graham notices it; Oral Roberts. Mr. Allen had some trouble, as you know. Oral Roberts has got that fifty-million-dollar buildings, and so forth, in there. He's got a school. And, well, nobody on the field now.\n\nL-44 I left here, by a vision, to go yonder to Tucson, to see what the Lord wanted me to do. There He met me up there, 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min as He told you here that He would do it, and the form of seven Angels, and said to return back and the Seven Seals was to be opened. That's just exactly what happened.\n\nL-45 He said, one day with Brother Woods when he come out there, we went to the same place, and throw up a rock, it come down, He said, \"Within a day and night, you're...\" Some, I forget just what the words was. \"You're going to see the glory of God.\"\n\nL-46 And the next day, a whirlwind came down out of the skies, and we know the story of what taken place. When it went up, they asked what it was. I said, \"It spoke three words, in three great blasts.\" The men only heard the blasting. I understood what It said. And said, \"'Judgment striking West Coast!'\" Two days after that, Alaska like to have sunk. It's been thundering around, earthquakes, everything. Just look at them, every day, earthquakes just shaking everywhere. [Job 38:1], [Nahum 1:3]\n\nL-47 My last meeting, last meeting I had. This will be my first Message, really, to preach since then. I was preaching in Los Angeles, at the Biltmore Auditorium, and I was speaking on a man choosing himself a wife. You probably got the tape of it. It's, I said, \"It reflects his character and his ambitions.\" That, when a man takes a woman, he takes a young girl, and to be his wife; he takes, you know, a modern girl that's a common Ricketta, it--it just shows what he's... If he marries a beauty queen or a sex queen, whatever it is, it shows his, what's really in the man. But a Christian, he looks for character in a woman, because he is planning a future home with that woman. He plan, he gets a homemaker. And I said, \"Then, Christ, according to His Word here, tells us what our future Home will be. What kind of a wife will He choose then, a denominational prostitute? Never! He'll choose a woman that's characterized by His Word, and that will be the Bride.\"\n\nL-48 And while in there, Something struck me, and I didn't know nothing for about thirty minutes. There was a prophecy went out. First thing I remember, Brother Mosley and Billy, I was out on the street, walking. And It said, \"Thou Capernaum, which calls yourself by the name of the Angels,\" that's Los Angeles, city of angels, see, the angels, \"which are exalted into heaven, will be brought down into hell. For, if the mighty works had been done in Sodom, that's been done in you, it would have been standing till this day.\" And that was all unconsciously, to me. See? [Matthew 11:23], [Luke 10:15]\n\nL-49 And how I just got through exhorting, Christ, exalting Him and telling the church. I said, \"You women, no matter how I try to come to you, or preach against these things; and you man, you preachers; you constantly conned all the time, do it just the same. You walk over It as if the Word of God wasn't nothing.\" [Matthew 11:23]\n\nL-50 And when I understood that, I went, I said, \"There is a Scripture about that somewhere.\" And I went and found it was Jesus, rebuking Capernaum by the seacoast. That night I looked up the Scriptures. Come home, got the history book; and Sodom and Gomorrah was once a--a thriving city, a Gentile headquarters of the world. And you know, that city, by an earthquake, sank into the Dead Sea. And Jesus stood, and said, \"Capernaum, if Sodom would have had the works done in it that you've had done in you, it would have been standing today. But now you must be brought down to hell!\" And about two hundred or three hundred years after His prophecy, with all them coastal towns, every one of them still standing but Capernaum, and it lays in the bottom of the sea. An earthquake sunk it into the sea. [Matthew 11:23-24]\n\nL-51 And then prophesying, \"Los Angeles will be in the bottom of the sea.\" And I come home, and went to Africa. And while I was in Africa, they had an earthquake. And scientists... You seen it, it was on a broadcast, that some big, fine homes tumbled in, in Los Angeles, and a motel, and so forth. And now there is a...\n\nL-52 Since that earthquake, there is a two- or three-inch crack that come in the earth, starting in Alaska, goes around through the Aleutian Islands, comes out about a hundred and fifty or two hundred miles in the sea, comes back up at San Diego; takes in California, or Los Angeles, and comes out again just below the northern part of California there, a little place called San Jose, just below there.\n\nL-53 And this scientist was speaking, being on an interview. We was watching on television. And he said, \"Beneath that is just a churning lava.\" And he said this, he said, \"That is a chunk will break loose,\" and said, \"and it will.\" And this 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min inter-...\n\nL-54 The man, scientist interviewing this chief scientist, said to him, said, \"Well, that could then all sink?\" He said, \"Could? It's got to!\" Said, \"Well, course, will probably be many, many years from now.\" He said, \"It can be in five minutes from now, or it can be in five years from now.\" He just lotted five years.\n\nL-55 But just as I sure was standing there under that Inspiration, put judgment on that West Coast, and then followed it right up here with the sinking of Los Angeles, she is gone! That's right. It will happen. When? I don't know.\n\nL-56 But, oh, what happened? You know, we only got six continents now. We had seven, that one that sunk between Africa and the United States. Oh, it's historical, you know about it. Now, if that goes down, then I want you to watch when...\n\nL-57 This was a sermon that I preached on when, I believe, Brother Elij' Perry might have been deacon here in the church at the time, for all I know. But it said, \"The time will come...\" I didn't know it until Mrs. Simpson brought me the--the sermon the other day. And I got it wrote in a little book, that the desert that...\" The ocean shall weep its way into the desert.\" That was thirty years ago.\n\nL-58 And, of course, the Salton Sea is about two hundred feet below sea level, and if that big churning, that earth swallowing in like that, with hundreds of square miles, hundreds and hundreds of square miles sinking into the earth, that will throw a tidal wave plum to Arizona. Sure, it would.\n\nL-59 Oh, we're at the end time, glorious hour, the appearing of the Lord Jesus! He said, \"There shall be earthquakes in divers places, perplexed of time, distress between nations, men's hearts failing in fear.\" Said, \"When these things begin to happen, raise up your head, your redemption is drawing nigh.\" Oh, my! [Matthew 24:7], [Mark 13:8], [Luke 21:11] Nations are breaking, Israel's awaking, The signs that the prophets foretold; The Gentile days numbered, with harrows encumbered; Return, O dispersed, to your own. (Be sure to do that!) That day of redemption is near, Man's hearts are failing for fear; Be filled with God's Spirit, have your lamps trimmed and clear, Look up, your redemption is near! (That's right.) False prophets are lying, God's Truth they're denying, That Jesus the Christ is our God.\n\nL-60 You see the picture the other day, how He turned that picture sideways there? And the very picture of those seven Angels being lifted up, turn it to the right-hand side, and there is the face of the Lord Jesus looking down to the earth again.\n\nL-61 You remember when I preached The Seven Church Ages, I couldn't understand why Jesus standing there with a \"white\" over His head. He was a young Man. I took it back in the Bible, it said, \"He came to the Ancient of Days, Whose hair was white as wool.\" Jesus was only thirty-three and a half years old, at His crucifixion. [Revelation 1:14]\n\nL-62 I called up Brother Jack Moore, a theologian. He said, \"Oh, Brother Branham, that's Jesus in His glorified stage.\" Said, \"After His death, burial, and resurrection, He turned to that.\" That sounded all right for a theologian, but it didn't go good, it didn't hit the something.\n\nL-63 I went up there and started on that first church age, there the Holy Spirit revealed it. Now you got it right on your Church Ages. I guess the books will be out pretty soon now, the full detail of it. And it showed that Jesus was Judge. There is a white wig that they used to wear, put a wig on and wear it as a judge, England still does it when you got supreme authority. And that turning sideways in this picture, there He is, His black hair, you can see it in the side of His beard, and the white wig on. He is the last of the authority, He is Supreme Authority. Even God said so, Himself, 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min \"This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him.\" [Matthew 17:5]\n\nL-64 There He is with them Angels, the Message, which was the seven breaking of them seven seals that revealed serpent seed and all these things here. And it shows that it is His very covering, it's--it's His Supreme Authority. He is Supreme, and He is wigged, or--or covered. The Bible said that He changed His countenance, or He changed Himself, en morphe. The word comes from the Greek word, en morphe, which means a Greek actor that plays many parts; today he is one thing, in the next act he is something else. He was God, the Father, in one act; God, the Son, in another act; and then God, the Holy Ghost, in this act. See? There He is, His Word is still Supreme. We're living in the last days. [Revelation 1:14]\n\nL-65 Coming back from Africa the other day, I kind of tired. You see, it's just it's nighttime there now, and you have to turn around. And then time I got turned around, come back again. We had a wonderful trip, hunting trip, one of the best I ever had in my life. Then Billy's got some pictures, maybe he'd have a time he can show it somewhere, and show you the trip.\n\nL-66 I had a dream. I'm always dreaming of being back at that Public Service Company, somehow. So I--I thought I was kind of ratting on the job, I was supposed... They just let me have my own way, and I thought I would... Instead of going out and walking the line or collecting the bills, or something I was supposed to do, I just said, \"Well, I'm my own boss,\" I just went swimming. And I got down there and took off my... these clothes, and put on my swimming clothes. I was by myself. And I thought, \"Say, this ain't right, the company... This is daytime, the company is paying me for this time.\" Thought, \"That's strange.\" And then I thought, \"Well, the money I collected on the route...\" I had both the patrol and the route mixed together, and I said, \"Well, the money I collected, I've done something, romping around here; I've lost all my tickets, and I got their money and my money mixed together. Now how will I know who paid the bill?\" I thought, \"Just because I wasn't paying any attention!\" I thought, \"That's not right. There is only one thing for me to do, that's, go back to my superintendent and tell him.\" That was Don Willis, I said, \"Don, I lost those tickets. Now here is all the money I got, and here is their money, together. Leave it here at the cashier. And the people, when they come in, they'll have a receipt that I received their bill.\"\n\nL-67 Probably people sitting right here that I--I... I know there is. That I collected from them in--in the days, and I'd... and I'd give a receipt. You know, it was only ten percent if you let your bill run over. And maybe, a dollar and a half, be fifteen cents over. A lot of them people lived... We just liked.to get together and talk, and they'd just let their bill go, and me come talk to them a while. Give fifteen cents, you know, just to sit down and talk a little while, and to collect their bill. So it got it rank, and just got so many bills I couldn't collect them.\n\nL-68 Well, I thought that's the only way I could do it. And I woke up.\n\nL-69 The place where we live, Sister Larson. I don't think she is here. She's been very nice to us; and she don't like for me to say that. But she is a very fine lady, and we've been living in her rooms. She's got two apartments, small apartments together, we rented them both. And wife and I sleep over here in--in the other apartment where I kind of receive the people when I can, and there is a couple of little twin beds in there.\n\nL-70 I woke up. She wasn't awake yet. And after a while, she woke up. And I waved over at her, and she looked back and batted her eyes a few times. I said, \"You sleep good?\" She said, \"No.\" And I said, \"I had the awfulest dream. I was back at that Public Service Company again.\" I said, \"What have I done?\"\n\nL-71 I remember, as a little boy, or a young man, I walked all those lines at Salem, Indiana, different... I'd go in, buy a--a breakfast, maybe a bowl of oats. In that hot sun and everything, and it'd just make me sick, to eat breakfast. I'd turn in ten cents, on my petty cash. The superintendent come down and said, said, \"You know what they said in the--in the meeting? 'Who is that knothead that would turn in ten cents, for breakfast?' Said, \"You ought to at least turn in fifty cents.\" Now, all of you know, fifty cents was a big breakfast in them days. And I said, \"Well, I don't eat that much.\" He said, \"Well, the rest of them turns in fifty cents. You ought to turn in fifty cents.\" 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min I said, \"Well, I don't use it.\" Said, \"Turn it in, anyhow.\" That was my superintendent.\n\nL-72 Well, I thought, \"Well, what can I do? I have to charge fifty cents, and I eat ten cents.\" So I'd go out on the street and get some little kids that didn't have no breakfast, and get them forty-cents worth of breakfast. So then I thought, \"Well, what could... Maybe that's what He holds against me.\"\n\nL-73 And I remember, here not long ago, they come through on the patrol, tore up that back yard back there, and said, \"Turn in your bill.\" You know they got patrol rights, but they have to pay for damage.\n\nL-74 I just wrote back and said, \"You don't owe nothing.\" I thought, \"That'd pay for them forty-centses. Maybe I've spent twenty or thirty dollars during that time, giving it to kids. Maybe that will do it.\" Kept on dreaming.\n\nL-75 Then I had a big tree out there, the kids played under it, and the patrol... Now they patrol in a helicopter. And so he come in and said, \"Billy, how about cutting that tree?\"\n\nL-76 I said, \"No, don't cut it. We're going to trim it.\" I said, \"Brother Wood and I are going to trim it.\" Said, \"Well, I'll just have the man come by and trim it.\" I said, \"Now, don't cut it.\" He said, \"I won't cut it.\"\n\nL-77 I went off on a trip. When I come back, she was cut plumb on the ground. Then I had a lawsuit coming, you see. I said, \"Well, Lord, this will clear it up, what I owed.\" So I struck that off, that was all right, just let it go. Well, I still dreamed it.\n\nL-78 When I got up the other morning, I said, \"Well...\" The first thing we do of a morning when we get up, is pray together, then pray when we go to bed at night. And then after she went on over to get the kiddies' breakfast, I started to pray. I said, \"Lord, I must have been an awful guy. What have I done in life, that I--I can't get away from that Public Service Company.\n\nL-79 I went in and took a bath, and come back out. And something just seemed to say to me, \"Maybe I'm ratting on His job.\" I thought, \"Here is about five years I ain't done nothing, just waiting on Him.\"\n\nL-80 Standing up there the other day. They built us a new home up there, and Brother Mosley come down, was talking about it. I said, \"That's just a little gift from my Father.\" And he started crying. I said, \"You see, He said, 'If you will leave your homes, houses, lands, fathers, mothers, I'll give you houses, lands, fathers, mothers, and a hundredfold in this life, and Eternal Life to come.'\" I said, \"See, I had to leave the Tabernacle that I love so dearly. My home that the Lord give me up there, had to leave it. He just give me this one back.\" I said, \"He is wonderful, you see.\" [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] And he started crying. [Mark 10:28-30], [Matthew 19:27-30]\n\nL-81 Well, I--I said, \"I had to come out here and separate myself, come to this desert.\" And I thought, \"Wonder why God would bring me to a desert, out here where there is nothing but scorpions and Gila monsters?\"\n\nL-82 It's not only a desert, is it hot, but it's spiritually a desert. Oh, my! There is no spiritual life at all, in the churches, they're against... Why, you never seen such in your life! We don't even have a church to go to, or nothing. And then when... The people almost perish, spiritually. I notice it in the people that come out there, see the differences in them, watching it.\n\nL-83 And so you stay under the Spirit of God, and your life becomes sweet, tender, like water brings this grass and soft buds. If... this grass, in Arizona, wouldn't grow; these trees would be cactus, them leaves just wind up and make stickery. That's the way it is when you get dry around the church, everybody is sticking one another, you know. And, see, you got to have soft waters of rain soften you up, and make leaves and shade for the pilgrim that passes by. [Galatians 5:22-25]\n\nL-84 And so something said to me, \"Maybe you're ratting on God's job.\" So, I prayed for a vision.\n\nL-85 And Meda just got me a new Bible; and Brother--Brother Brown, from up in Ohio, got me a new Bible; both of them at the same time, at Christmas. I went and got one of the new Bibles. I said, \"Lord, in the days gone by, You had 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min a Urim and Thummim.\"\n\nL-86 Now listen, let me say this. Course, they're not... this, is not taping this meeting, the reason I'm ask... saying this. Let me say, don't do this. It's not a good thing.\n\nL-87 But I said, \"Lord, it used to be, when a dreamer dreamed a dream, that they took it down to the Urim and Thummim, and told it. And if the--if the Urim and Thummim flashed the lights back, a supernatural Light, the dream was true.\" I said, \"But that priesthood and that Urim and Thummim is done away with. Your Bible is the Urim and Thummim now; Lord, may I never do this again. But I've asked You and prayed to You, to give me a vision, speak to me about why am I dreaming these dreams. And what have I done? If I've harmed, if I've done anything to any person in the world, let me know. I'll--I'll--I'll go make it right. If I owe the Public Service Company, if I done something wrong to them or any other person, if I done something wrong to You, let me know. I--I want to make it right.\"\n\nL-88 Let's make it right, now. Don't wait till after a while, it may be too late. Let's do it now.\n\nL-89 And I said, \"Surely, there is something in this Word of God, from Genesis to Revelation, that some character in there that You dealt with, would be on the same basis that would be my question. If somebody done something, and--and You got after him about it, then let me turn to that place in the Bible. And if somebody, whatever they done, it'll lean my way. Where I've done wrong, or something You want me to do, or haven't done, let me see some character in the Bible like that.\"\n\nL-90 And I closed my eyes, just let the Bible fall open, put my finger on a Scripture, Genesis 24:7. Eliezer, Abraham's faithful servant, the model servant of the Bible, being sent to hunt the bride for Isaac. Chills run over me. Sure, that's my... that's right with the rest of my Message, pulling out the Bride. [Genesis 24:3-7]\n\nL-91 He said, \"Sware that you'll not take a bride out of these, but go to my own people.\" He said, \"What if the woman won't come with me?\" [Genesis 24:8]\n\nL-92 Said, \"Then you're free of this oath.\" He said, \"And the God of Heaven will send His Angel before you, to direct you.\" He went right straight out and begin praying, and he met the beautiful Rebekah that become the bride of Isaac. [Genesis 24:12-14]\n\nL-93 Just a perfect Message, back to the Word, \"Go get that Bride!\" That's a duty. That's what I'm here for. That's what I'm trying to do, is call out a Bride.\n\nL-94 Remember in California there, that interview of the Bride, preview, I had it here. How that Bride come up first, and seen Her go by. Then here come Miss America, Miss Asia, and all, oh, the awfulest looking thing! And then the same Bride passed by again. One of them got out of step, and I was getting Her back in step; two of them, it was. And that's what I was supposed to do, keep that Bride in step, hunt that man.\n\nL-95 I said, \"God, I'm going back home, renew my vows again, and start out anew.\" So that's what we're planning on doing, that's what I'm here for.\n\nL-96 I think it would be a good thing if we did this, started on the eighteenth, next week, next Sunday morning, next Sunday night; the following Sunday, and the following Sunday. How many thinks that would be a good thing? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Thank you.\n\nL-97 Now I want you to do something for me. If you have notified any people that there--there is going to be a meeting on the twenty-eighth, will you renotify them again, that we couldn't do it. Tell, write them a letter, or something another. We don't want the people come and be disappointed, but we could not get the auditorium.\n\nL-98 See, we couldn't get it. And so because the last meeting I think we had so many up there, and everything, they just... You know how the public is, and they... Well, we're just living in the last days, that's all. And they claim that the people come in and disturb the school, and they were there too early, and they did this, or that, or something another, and the place was too jammed up, and the fire marshall does this and that. And, well, you know.\n\nL-99 So we will set up those Vials and those Trumpets, I want to place them in. I told you I would. They come under another thing. So does the Vials come over, the sounding of trumpets; but we want to take the entire course right 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min straight through, and bring it, tie it in together.\n\nL-100 How many has read any of Brother Vayle, on rewriting that, and fixing it up and grammarizing it for me? Have you read any of it? You have, two or three of you. I think you done a real job, Brother Vayle, a real job! You, I think Sister Vayle did it; and you just wrote it down and she done it. She was a... See, I'm not always against the women, am I, Sister Vayle?\n\nL-101 So now let us, for the next fifteen, twenty minutes, read a Scripture here.\n\nL-102 And I got a little book here. I told, I believe, it was to Brother Vayle, or, who was it, or I believe it was Roy Borders. Brother Vayle bought me the book. I want to make a little textbook.\n\nL-103 But if anybody ever looked at what I call notes! Like I want to preach about the Morning Star, I'll draw a star. And if I want to preach something about... I make it all in symbols here, scratches, nobody can ever know what it was. While I'm out, and I think of anything, I got to, on riding on the road, sometimes the car is jumping up-and-down, and I'll jot this down, and say this and that, and make little signs, and cross and bridges, and--and all kinds of things. Like I want to preach on the descending of the Star; and I'll put the pyramid, draw it out here and put the five-point star of David coming down on it. And I know where I'm going in the Scriptures like that; and Moses, a certain thing he done. Just make little turkey tracks, like.\n\nL-104 I got several of them in here. And I thought, this morning, back there when I thought I'd speak on this subject for a few minutes here, on a note, maybe it'd take me twenty minutes.\n\nL-105 And then I ain't going to take Brother Neville's service tonight. I--I--I'm going to rest tonight, listen to him.\n\nL-106 And then, the Lord willing, next Sunday morning we'll start the service. And you all help me, and we'll pray, because it was in my heart to try... They said, \"Well, we could go to Louisville or we could go down in New Albany.\" But the meeting was supposed to be for Jeffersonville. I'll go to Louisville and New Albany, at different times, but this is supposed to be here at Jeffersonville.\n\nL-107 Now let's bow our heads just a minute while we been... I been talking to you here for about thirty minutes. Let's speak to Him a moment.\n\nL-108 Lord Jesus, we are--we are certainly a blessed people, above our thinking, above our understanding. For, if there was a noble among us, such as some personnel from some other country, or a diplomat of some sort, we would think it was great to have such a noble person among us. But today we have the God of Heaven, not only among us, but in us, dwelling, living His Life through us. And we're so thankful for this, Lord! It's beyond our understanding, of course.\n\nL-109 But now speaking on what the services, and going to Africa, and the things that we've tried to arrange for these few days here in Indiana. And somehow or another, Lord, it may be You are driving us to that tent, to make that vision fulfill. So Thy will be done, we've committed it this way, the best of our understanding. So we pray, Lord, if there is any thing contrary to Your will, You'll make it known to us, that we might know to do Your perfect will.\n\nL-110 Now bless us in these next few minutes. Speak to us through Thy Word, Lord, for Thy Word is Truth. We ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. Let's turn in the Bible, to Mark, the 8th chapter.\n\nL-111 When do you usually let out, twelve o'clock? [Someone says, \"About twelve o'clock.\"--Ed.] All right. Now, now just a little short Message here that I can speak to you about the Word, after testifying about over there, and so forth.\n\nL-112 Mark, the 8th chapter, and let's begin about the 34th verse, to the thirty-... taking the 38th, the rest of that chapter. I like to read what He said, 'cause I know that's true. Now we... And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it;... whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. For what shall it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and lose his own soul? 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. [Mark 8:34-38]\n\nL-113 I want to take a little text from there, if it'd be called that, called: Ashamed. You know, I like that. \"Whosoever is ashamed of Me and of My Words, I'll be ashamed of him.\"\n\nL-114 Now, the word ashamed could be also translated \"embarrassed.\" You know, something that you're... You are faced with something that you're embarrassed about, being ashamed. [Mark 8:38]\n\nL-115 That, another thing being ashamed does, it shows that you are not sure of what you're talking about. If you know what you're talking about, and have the assurance that you know what you're talking about, you can tell anybody that; you're not ashamed. But if you feel put out, out of place, it shows you're not sure.\n\nL-116 You notice there is so much of that today, especially on the subject that I'm speaking of, \"ashamed of the Word.\" Now, He and the Word are the same. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,... The same yesterday, today, and forever! [John 1:1], [John 1:14], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-117 So, \"Whosoever is ashamed of Me and My Word,\" and He and His Word are One, so being ashamed of His Word in this sinful, present generation, \"I'll be ashamed of him.\" [Mark 8:38]\n\nL-118 Now we notice today, if somebody says, \"Are--are you a Christian?\" It's very much a popular thing, say, \"Oh, I'm a Christian!\" See?\n\nL-119 \"But do you believe the Word of God, where It said, 'These signs shall follow them that believe'?\" [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-120 \"Oh!\" Even ministers' faces will blush. See?\n\nL-121 Are you ashamed of, say, of Divine healing? Are you ashamed of the full Gospel? Are you ashamed of your pentecostal experience? That's being ashamed of His Word. That's His Word made flesh in you.\n\nL-122 So, His Word has to live Itself out for every generation. It lived Itself in the days of Moses. Because, in that day, the Bible said, in Hebrews, 1st chapter, \"God, in sundry times and divers manners spake to the fathers by the prophets.\" [Hebrews 1:1]\n\nL-123 And those prophets! The church got all so twisted up that when... Those prophets, those daring messengers of God, come without church, without denomination, without organization, without anything; defied kings, kingdoms, churches, and everything. When the priests was brought before... They was brought before the priests, they wasn't ashamed, because they had directly THUS SAITH THE LORD. [Hebrews 11:32-40]\n\nL-124 If you notice, the prophet, in one sense of the word, in the Old Testament, when he said THUS SAITH THE LORD, now watch him, he goes right into the phrase of taking the place of God. You notice, when he placed out before him, THUS SAITH THE LORD, he fell right into God, and he acted as God. Then he gave his Message, which was God speaking through him, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD!\" [Deuteronomy 18:18]\n\nL-125 I think of the prophets of old, when they come with that Message, and It embarrassed the kings, and It made the people feel uncomfortable. The priests, even, they would feel uncomfortable, because they were supposed to be leaders, religious man, and when they... the Word came forth in that manner, It exposed them, and they felt embarrassed, or ashamed.\n\nL-126 And many times we see that, not many, too often today! That man, you say, \"I am a Christian!\" \"Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?\" \"Oh! Huh!\" You see, they're--they're embarrassed about It. [Acts 19:2]\n\nL-127 Somebody say, \"Do you belong to that group up there that does all that there shouting, and all that Divine healing stuff?\" Many times, Christians back up. 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min\n\nL-128 They want to announce, if--if they got a denomination, now, \"I'm Baptist. I'm Presbyterian. I'm Lutheran.\" They're not ashamed of that.\n\nL-129 But when it comes to being a Christian that can take God's Word just the way It is, then they're--they're--they're ashamed. \"I don't belong to any denomination,\" see, they, they're--they're ashamed to say that. They've got to be like the rest of the world, represented by some organization.\n\nL-130 Now, that's just recently come into that. In the days of Luther, to recognize yourself as a Lutheran or a follower of Luther, well, it almost meant death by the Catholic church. In the days of Wesley, to know that you had defied the Anglican church, it was almost a penalty of death by the Anglicans, to announce that you were a Methodist. In the days of Pentecost, it was a shame, almost, to say that you was--that you was a pentecostal, because you was quickly counted a holy-roller, or--or some tongue-speaker, or something like that. Now they organized and went right in with the rest of the group.\n\nL-131 Now when the calling-out time comes, that you don't belong to any of it! It's very popular to say, \"I'm Pentecost.\" It's very popular to say, \"I'm Presbyterian. Lutheran.\" But what when it comes to the time that you'll have to come out and stand for the Word, \"I don't belong to any of it\"? That, that embarrassed.\n\nL-132 Jesus said, \"Now, if you are ashamed of Me, then I'll be ashamed of you.\" Why would He be ashamed of you? Because you are claiming to be His, when you won't follow Him. [Mark 8:38]\n\nL-133 What if I said, \"This little boy, he's--he's my son\"; he turn around and say, \"Who, me be your son? What do you think I am!\" It would embarrass me. It would, to your son.\n\nL-134 And that's the way that's so-called Christianity today. If you name it a name of a denomination, all right, they accept the fatherhood of a denomination. But when it comes to accepting the fatherhood of the Word of God, Christ, no, they're embarrassed. They don't want to say, \"Yes, I have spoke with tongues. Yes, I have seen visions. Yes, I believe in Divine healing. Yes, I praise the Lord. I'm free from all organization, I'm not bowing down to any of that. I'm a servant of Christ.\" Oh, my, that'd just tear them to pieces.\n\nL-135 The other night, a great speaker come in amongst the Full Gospel Business Men in Chicago.\n\nL-136 And may I stop here just a minute, to say this. You excuse me. But many times you think, and I do too, that what we're talking about, the Truth of the Bible, don't go over amongst the people. But, It does. Sometime they'll rear right up against It, but they really don't mean it. They're trying to find where you're standing.\n\nL-137 As the story was about a bunch of drunks, arguing that there was no such thing as Christianity. One man said, \"I know where there is one at, that's my wife.\" Said, \"Well, I--I don't believe it.\" Said, \"Come on, we'll... let's all act like we're really drunk.\"\n\nL-138 Went up there at the house, and done everything they could. And--and told them cook them some eggs, and then he throwed them out on the floor, and said, \"You know better than to cook my eggs like that!\" Carrying on in the house. And they went over in the other room, fell down in a chair. They heard somebody out there sweeping it up, not saying a word, saying, singing a little song to herself. Must Jesus bear the cross alone, And all the world go free? There is a cross for every one, And there is a cross for me. And this consecrated cross I'll bear, Till death shall set me free, And then go home a crown to wear.\n\nL-139 That one old drunk said, \"What'd I tell you?\" Said, \"She is a Christian!\" See, they was only trying her. And sometimes the world, I've found out, try you. 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min\n\nL-140 So I never thought this would happen, but last Saturday night, I believe it was, or Sunday night, the great speaker... I don't subject to calling people's names. But he's trying, working exactly contrary. I'm trying to keep them churches out of that ecumenical move, and this man is trying to put them in there. So, he was speaking for the Christian Business Men. Which, I was supposed to have had the meeting in Chicago, and I thought I'd be in Africa at that time, so I couldn't take it. This man said, got up there and said, \"The greatest move, the greatest thing in the earth now, that's ever been; all the churches are returning back to the Catholic church, in the ecumenical move, and the Catholics will receive the Holy Ghost.\" What a trap of the Devil!\n\nL-141 And this leader, Brother Shakarian, the president of the International Business Men, stood up and said, after the man sat down, said, \"That's not the way we've heard it.\" Said, \"Brother Branham has told us, that, 'This ecumenical move will move them all to the mark of the beast.'\" And the man setting on the platform. Said, \"'It'll move it to the mark of the beast.'\" And said, \"We're inclined to believe what he says is the Truth.\" [Someone in congregation says, \"Amen! So are we!\"--Ed.] And he said, \"How many of you would like to hear Brother Branham come and give you the true side of it? Raise.\" And there was five thousand something people. They screamed and cried, just to come for one day, one day.\n\nL-142 Brother Carl Williams called me up, said, \"Brother Branham, boy, I went out through that crowd,\" said, \"they had piles of hundred-dollar bills laying in my hands, to get your airplane ticket up here, and back.\" See, just for one day!\n\nL-143 See, those people, that Word is sinking in where sometimes we don't know it. See? But, see, when you're really... No matter how much the world is against It, how much the denominations are against It, God is proving It to be the Truth. When the great hour finally strikes, things will happen maybe that we didn't think about.\n\nL-144 Yes, it shows you're not sure, if you're embarrassed, so you would rather not discuss the subject. If you're going to be ashamed of it, you wouldn't want to discuss it; hold back.\n\nL-145 But how can a man who is filled with the Holy Ghost, how can a man full of the Power of God, and the love of God in his heart, talk to a man a few minutes and not mention something about that love that's in his heart? See, there is something that it--it happens; you can't do it.\n\nL-146 This is, must be that evil day that Jesus was speaking of. People are ashamed of the Word and of the Spirit of God that acts within them. But when the Truth is made plain to the people, God then, Himself, revealing Himself through the Word.\n\nL-147 Now, any man can make any kind of claims. And we've had it in these days, where there has been so many claims claimed, that it's been horrible. But, you see, if there is a Truth, it must be by the Word. Because, they say they had all kinds of things, of oil flowing through people, and blood out of their hands, and women on their back in this blood, and running down their shoes, and raise up their shoes and pour oil out, and frogs jumping out and hopping down the platform, and all kinds of things like that. There is no such stuff as that in the Bible. There is no promise of anything like that, in the Bible. Only, It said, \"In the last days, the spirit would be so close it would deceive the Elected if possible.\" But there is no Scripture for that. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-148 But when it comes to genuine, unadulterated Word of God, confirmed by God, It seems to even embarrass the other group, on the radical side. See, there is an embarrassment about It.\n\nL-149 But It's a reality to a man or woman, boy or girl, who really is a genuine Christian. When God made the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and you receive It, there is Something that settles within you, that there is nothing takes Its place. When a man ever meets God; not in some emotional work up, some enthusiasm, or some religious doctrine, some catechism or creed, or a dogma that he has accepted for a--a comfort for hisself. But when he really comes to the place like Moses did, on the back side of the desert, walk up face to face with Almighty God, and you see the Voice speaking to you, exactly with the Word and the promise of the hour, there is something It does to you! See, you're not ashamed of It, It does something to you. Now, let us look now, for just the next fifteen minutes.\n\nL-150 There is some people that receive such an experience. And as I speak to you today, not as a church or as a denomination, I speak to you as an individual; not because you come here to this Tabernacle, because that I love you 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min and you love me, not because of that. Let me speak to you as a dying mortal, that someday you've got to come to the end of this life. And I may not be there, and another preacher might not be there. But there is only One Who can meet you there, and that's God. And you--you listen to It, and not whether \"my wife is a good Christian\" or--or \"my husband is a good Christian,\" but, \"Am I right with God? Have I met God like that?\" Not because \"my pastor met God,\" or because \"my deacon met God,\" but, \"Have I met Him?\" Not because \"I shouted,\" not because \"I spoke in tongues,\" but because, \"I met Him as a Person!\" Then you'll never be ashamed of That, there is Something that's so perfect and pure, and true. [Revelation 3:20]\n\nL-151 And remember, you might meet a spirit that would act like God. You might meet a spirit, would do this, that, or the other; follow it a little bit and see how it compares with the Word of God. You might meet a spirit that would tell you you are saved, and give you a glorious feeling, and you would shout and scream; then when it comes to denying the Word, how can the Holy Spirit, that wrote the Word, deny His Own Word? That Spirit must punctuate every promise of God with an \"amen\"! If it isn't, then you never met God, you met a deceiving spirit. And the world is full of it today! [John 16:13]\n\nL-152 But when you see God come down and make a statement, that He's going to do a certain thing, then it comes back and does that, time after time after time, then you've got a genuine Spirit of God.\n\nL-153 How could a Spirit be on a man, the Holy Spirit that wrote the Bible, then turn around and deny, \"That's not right, That was for some other day\"?\n\nL-154 He said, \"The promise is unto you, and to your children, to them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.\" That was Acts 2:38. How can a spirit then accept anything different from That, and be of God, when Hebrews 13:8 said, \"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever\"? [Acts 2:38], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-155 What if somebody said, \"Oh, I believe He was a philosopher. He was a good man. He was a prophet. But as far as His power...\"\n\nL-156 I was speaking the other night with George Smith, the boy that goes with my daughter, Rebekah; a fine kid, sang here in the Tabernacle. A Baptist boy that just took, told, \"Take my name off of that thing! I want nothing to do with it.\" And there was a young lady... They was having a conference, this certain Baptist church, up in the hills.\n\nL-157 And--and they're so firmly against me, all of them out there, and about not... They've not got nothing against me; it's against this Word. Me, as a man, they can't say nothing against me, I never done them any harm. But That is what they're afraid of. See? Now we were...\n\nL-158 They was having this meeting up there, rather, and they had, was going to have a missionary to take the last three nights of this great conference, up in the hills where it was cool. Happen to be, this missionary got up and come onto Mark 16, and he said, \"There is many people today who can't believe in Divine healing.\" Said, \"I was in India. I'm an Indian. And I was in India when a man here in the United States, by the name of Brother Branham, come.\" The pastor begin to move over. Said, \"My wife was dying with cancer. I was blind,\" or something like that. \"He prayed for one of us, and the other one he called out in the audience, not even knowing our own language, and spoke the Power of God.\" And said, \"We're here, healed!\" Well, they tried to shut him up. They couldn't do it. That's, see, right in their own conference.\n\nL-159 Then they even denied of anything. And some of the people, even my... this boy's sister, them on the ground, wouldn't even have nothing to say. They wanted to know if she wasn't connected, some way they could get down to find out. One of the ladies said, \"Well, I believe it.\"\n\nL-160 Rebekah and George went to see this lady. And she went and got a girl that was suffering with a--a... kind of retarded, a little. So they had me come over there to see the girl, the other night. And I went over there, the little lady was sitting there, and I said, \"Are you a believer?\"\n\nL-161 She said, \"Nah, I don't know whether I am or not.\" Well, she wasn't retarded; just a devil spirit. They don't realize it. See, it takes you, and you don't know it. It comes, then violence overcomes the person, and they don't know it. 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min\n\nL-162 Women that walks out here on the street, with these shorts on, they don't realize. They might be, they could might could prove and sware to it, that they've never done anything evil against their husband, or so forth, like that. But in their heart, they don't realize, but the spirit of the Devil has took them over. They are possessed of it. Why would a woman want to strip her clothes off, off before a man? There is only one person who done it, in the Bible, and they were insane. Others try to cover themselves; they don't realize. It's so cunning, so subtle! You have to watch, weigh yourself with the Word of God, and see where you're standing.\n\nL-163 This young lady said, \"Oh, they told me that I was baptized when I was a kid.\" Said, \"I don't know whether to believe that stuff or not.\" I said, \"Don't you believe Jesus Christ?\"\n\nL-164 And she said, \"Well, I don't know whether I do or not.\" She said, \"Some of that hocus-pocus stuff, I don't believe it.\"\n\nL-165 I said, \"Well, of course, you don't believe hocus-pocus stuff.\" I said, \"But do you believe that He was the Son of God?\" \"Oh,\" said, \"He could have been.\"\n\nL-166 I said, and I said, \"Do you believe He is the same today, the God that would save you?\"\n\nL-167 She said, \"Is any of that there stuff about that there miracles and stuff like that? I don't believe nothing about it.\"\n\nL-168 And I said, \"What would you do if you were setting in a meeting and seen God, the Holy Spirit, which is the only God there is, working amongst the people; God in the Fatherhood, the Pillar of Fire, and the prophets; God in His Son; then God in His people? It's just attributes of God, one great God Who covers Eternity.\" I said, \"What would you see if He, among His people, made the--the blind to see, the deaf to hear, look out upon the audience and tell the people what was wrong with them, and like He did when He was here on earth?\" She said, \"I believe it would be horoscope.\" [Matthew 4:23], [Luke 7:22]\n\nL-169 I said, \"You are in a worse shape than I thought you were. You would be better off if you was crazy, see, you wouldn't be accountable.\" But I said, \"You're just possessed of an evil spirit.\" I said, \"When Jesus told the woman at the well about her husbands, when He looked upon the people and perceived their thoughts, would you call that horoscope?\" See, just so wrapped up in a denomination, called Lutheran, that anything contrary to that would be wrong! [John 4:18]\n\nL-170 Now God wants man who is wrapped up in the Word. Anything contrary to That is wrong! Jesus said, \"Let every man's word be a lie, and Mine be the Truth.\" [Romans 3:4]\n\nL-171 There was a man in a very scientific age, by the name of Noah. He wasn't ashamed of God's Word. God met him, and He talked to him. He knowed it was God. And He said, \"It's going to rain!\" It never had rained, but he believed it was going to rain. And the faith that he had, he wasn't ashamed to exercise it. He took a hundred and twenty years to build an ark, when the world was against him. He wasn't ashamed of God's Word, in his day. God saved him and his household, for it. There was a... How foolish it might have seemed to be to other people; but, to him, he met God. No matter how scientific the other was, that was contrary, how it said \"it couldn't happen, it couldn't happen,\" he met God! [Genesis 6:5-22]\n\nL-172 That's what it is when you know that you're talking to Him! You would think it was a foolish thing when somebody... When, I know that there is a few people in the world holds on to what I say to be the Truth. To stand here and say, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD, I'm going to Arizona, there I'll meet seven Angels in a cluster,\" well, there was a group of man standing there to see it happen. The other night, saying it, \"Los Angeles would fall into the ocean.\" But when you have met God, and the God Who doesn't fail, the God Who does exactly what He said He would do, He has always done it, you're not ashamed of it then. You don't have to walk back and be embarrassed about it; you can tell the whole world. When a man meets God, talks to Him, and the reality of God becomes his in his heart, he's not ashamed of It.\n\nL-173 Noah wasn't ashamed. It seemed foolish to the rest of the world, but not to him. 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min\n\nL-174 Moses, when he was before Pharaoh, he wasn't ashamed to tell Pharaoh that these certain things would happen, because he had met God. God told him, in the burning bush. Moses said, \"I--I stutter.\" That's what he had, an impediment of speech. [Exodus 4:10]\n\nL-175 He said, \"There comes Aaron. You be God to him, and he'll be prophet to you. I know he can speak well. But I'll be with your mouth. Who made man to speak?\" Amen. I like that. That's God. \"Who made man be deaf or dumb, or who made man to speak?\" God has. He said, \"Lord, show me Your glory.\" Said, \"What's that in your hand?\" He said, \"It's a stick.\" [Exodus 7:1], [Exodus 4:2, 11-12]\n\nL-176 Said, \"Throw it on the ground,\" it turned to a serpent. Said, \"Take it up again,\" it turned back to a stick. Amen. He's God. \"Put your hand in your bosom.\" He put it in, pulled it out, white with leprosy. Said, \"Put it back and pull it again,\" and it was like the other hand. \"I'm God.\" [Exodus 4:3-5]\n\nL-177 Then he walk up before Pharaoh and say what He said he would say. He said, \"It's going to be thus and thus.\" Picked up sand and throwed it up in the air, and said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD, let fleas come upon the earth,\" and the fleas came. Took water and poured it out into the river, and said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD,\" and the whole rivers and everything turned to blood. Called hail down out of heaven. [Exodus 8:16], [Exodus 7:17], [Exodus 9:24]\n\nL-178 You know, in the last days there is supposed to be them plagues repeat again. And remember, an adulterer, in the Bible time, his penalty was death by stoning. And the unbelieving church will be stoned to death, with hailstones, was once God's way of punishment. He'll stone this unbelieving world, this adulterous generation. He'll stone it from heaven, with hailstones weighing a talent apiece, which is a hundred pounds. The adulterous church will die, adulterous world will die under the punishment of God, under stoning, like He did in the beginning. Get right with God, church! That's what we all must do, turn back to God!\n\nL-179 That old fuzzy-faced, gray-haired whiskers, bald-headed, skinny arms, eighty-year-old Elijah sitting up there in the wilderness, looking out upon the sins of the people. God spoke to him one morning, said, \"Go down there and tell Ahab that not even the dew will fall from heaven till you call for it.\" [I Kings 17:1]\n\nL-180 I can see his little old eyes looking out from under that fuzzy-looking white beard, that stick in his hand, walking down the road like a sixteen-year-old boy. Walked right up in the presence of the king, and said, \"Not even dew will come from heaven till I call for it.\" He wasn't ashamed of God or His Word; tell a king or anybody else. He wasn't ashamed. Didn't have to hide, say, \"Now, Ahab, you'd be a...\" [I Kings 17:1]\n\nL-181 It puts me in mind of something like ourselves. Then I said to the people, \"I'm getting to a spot, I need more faith.\" That's what I'm home for now is to get a--a new burst of faith.\n\nL-182 Got so, look like, when you pray for people, you apologize, \"Mr. Devil, would you please move over and let me...?\" Nothing! Faith has got muscles, and hair on its chest. When it speaks, everything else shuts up. Don't go in, \"Mr. Devil, you move out?\"\n\nL-183 \"Get out of here! I'm a son of God, commissioned of God. Leave them alone!\" That moves. You have no apology to the Devil, nothing to do with him. Not ashamed of the Word of God, not ashamed of your commission, not ashamed of who we are.\n\nL-184 The only shame that I am, is I'm a Branham, that's my earthly birth. I'm ashamed of my failures.\n\nL-185 But as His servant, I'm not ashamed! I'm not ashamed of His Word. Whether it's denominations, kings, potentates, or whatever it might be; just ready to give an answer, God calls for it.\n\nL-186 Moses walked up before Pharaoh. He wasn't ashamed to tell him that they would not compromise and take his so-many days out in the wilderness. He said, \"Some of the women stay, by your children.\"\n\nL-187 Said, \"We'll all go! Not even one hoof will be left behind, we'll take our cattle and all.\" He wasn't ashamed. Why? 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min He had come into the Light of deliverance. [Exodus 10:9]\n\nL-188 That's the reason a man or a woman, sick or anything, once comes into the Presence of God, and knows that God has healed them, you're stepping into the Light of deliverance. You don't compromise on anything.\n\nL-189 Deliverance was in his heart, for he had met the God Who said, \"I am the God of Abraham, Who give Abraham the promise. And the time, time of redemption, of deliverance, is at hand. I'm sending you down there to take them out.\" What's to apologize, about that? [Exodus 3:6]\n\nL-190 Pharaoh could have killed him. He was just a man. He was a slave. He could have killed him. But he wasn't ashamed of the Word. He didn't come down and get on his knees and beg to Pharaoh for nothing. He said, \"I come to take them.\" Pharaoh said, \"Well, you can't take them!\"\n\nL-191 He said, \"All right, then there will be fleas upon the earth, till you will wade through them.\" And there is what happened. Said, \"Oh, Moses, take them away!\" He said, \"All right. Now do you repent?\" Said, \"Well, you can go so-many days in the wilderness.\"\n\nL-192 He said, \"Then flies will come.\" Amen. Said, \"Darkness will come.\" It was so dark you couldn't see one place to the other.\n\nL-193 And finally death come. From Pharaoh to the servant, it was death for the oldest child in the family. Didn't have no apology to nobody. He was a son of Abraham, born in the Spirit of God, given commission by God, the Message of God, to go down and take those people out.\n\nL-194 Well, can't God call the same thing in this hour, to take out of the church a Bride? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Daniel wasn't, or...\n\nL-195 David, rather, wasn't afraid before Saul. When everybody was afraid of Goliath out there, he wasn't afraid to walk up. And said, \"Your servant...\" This little ruddy-looking fellow said, \"Your servant was herding his father's sheep, and a bear come in and got one of them. I chased him out in the wilderness and killed him, with this slingshot. A lion come in.\" Oh, my! \"A lion come in and got one of them, and run out in the wilderness, and I knocked him down with a slingshot. When he got up, I killed him.\" He said, \"And the God...\" That backslidden king standing there, them wishy-washy soldiers claiming to serve the God of Heaven, and let that uncircumcised Philistine stand out there and defy the armies of the living God. Said, \"Your servant also will slay him. For, the God Who delivered the lion and the bear to me, will also deliver that uncircumcised Philistine.\" He didn't stutter, didn't say, \"perhaps it'll be done.\" He said, \"It'll be done!\" He wasn't ashamed. [I Samuel 17:37]\n\nL-196 Daniel, before the king, wasn't afraid to defy his orders that nobody would pray, only to him. He opened up the windows and threw up the sash, and prayed three times a day. He wasn't afraid. [Daniel 6:10]\n\nL-197 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, wasn't afraid of that fiery furnace. Said, \"Our God is able to deliver us. God can deliver us. But if He don't, we're not bowing down to your image.\" They wasn't ashamed of it. No, sir. No, sir. They certainly wasn't ashamed of it, because they knew. [Daniel 3:17]\n\nL-198 Samson wasn't ashamed before the Philistines. When a thousand run up to him, he picked up the jaw bone of a mule. And them helmets, they was about an inch and a half thick, of brass. He beat a thousand down with it, and still had the jaw bone in his hand. He wasn't embarrassed. He just picked up what was in his hands, and went to work with it. He knowed that the Spirit of God was upon him. He knowed he was borned a Nazarite. He knowed that nothing could bother him. He was a servant of God. As long as he was in the will of God, nothing could stand in his way, no matter how many kings or Philistines, or whatever more come up. Right. [Judges 15:15]\n\nL-199 John wasn't ashamed of the Word of God that came to him in the wilderness, and told him to go baptize with water. He wasn't ashamed to say, \"Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world,\" for the Spirit of God 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min was upon him. He wasn't ashamed before the priests. [John 1:29]\n\nL-200 He wasn't ashamed of the Word of God when he walked up to Herod. Philip's wife was living with Herod. Walked right up in the face of the king! This old wooly-faced fellow out of the wilderness there, come out of there, with no education or nothing else, and walked right up in the face of Herod, and said, \"It's not lawful for you to have her!\" He wasn't ashamed of God's Word. Sure. He absolutely was not ashamed of It. Stephen, he wasn't ashamed of God's Word. [Matthew 14:4], [Mark 6:18]\n\nL-201 First, the pentecostal people up there on the Day of Pentecost, when they gathered in the upper room, the Holy Ghost fell upon them, by a promise of God. Luke 24:49 said: ... behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but wait... in the city of Jerusalem, until you receive power from on high. [Luke 24:49]\n\nL-202 And the very promise that the Word of God promised to them, \"Behold, I send the promise of My Father upon you, but wait there; don't get no more theology or educations, and so forth, wait till you're endued with Power.\" And when that Power from Heaven came, like a rushing mighty wind, they wasn't ashamed of the Gospel. [Acts 2:2]\n\nL-203 Peter stood up, said, \"Repent, every one of you. You man, with wicked hands, you've crucified the Prince of Peace, which God has raised from the dead. And we're a witness. For this is what Joel said would come to pass in the last days, 'I'll pour out My Spirit upon all flesh.'\" He wasn't ashamed of the Gospel. [Acts 2:17, 38]\n\nL-204 Little Stephen, as I mentioned him a few minutes ago, when he went through there like a--a--a tornado. He wasn't a preacher. He was just a deacon, but he testified everywhere of the resurrection. He had met God. And it's just like...\n\nL-205 Try to stop him? Well, it was like trying to put a--a house, a burning house, fire out of it, on a windy day, in a dry time. Why, every time the wind blew, it just set another fire.\n\nL-206 They jerked him up before the Sanhedrin Council. Can you realize what that is? That's like the Ecumenical Council. All religions head up, in under the Ecumenical Council. All of them headed up there under the Sanhedrin Council. Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians, whatever they were, they had to come into that council. And they snatched him up, just not one organization, but the big council snatched him up. \"We'll scare the liver out of him.\"\n\nL-207 When he walked up, that morning, the Bible said his face looked like an Angel. He said, \"Men and brethren, let me speak to you. Our fathers dwelled in Mesopotamia before they came to Charran,\" and so forth. He still went and give the Scriptures. Then when he got all wound up, the Spirit come upon him, he said, \"You stiff-necked, uncircumcised of heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Ghost; like your fathers did, so do you.\" He wasn't ashamed of the Gospel, wasn't ashamed of the Word. He wasn't embarrassed before any Sanhedrin Council. No. [Acts 6:15], [Acts 7:2, 51]\n\nL-208 Paul said before Agrippa. Being a Jew, taught under Gamaliel, a great dignitary he was. But one day, on the road down to Damascus, he come in Presence, contact with God. An Angel came down from Heaven, in a form of a Pillar of Fire, a Light that struck him on the ground. Raised up, and said, \"Lord, Who are You?\" And He said, \"I am Jesus.\" [Acts 9:4]\n\nL-209 Standing before Agrippa, he repeated the story again. He said, \"I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, for It's the Power of God unto salvation, to everyone that believes.\" Sure. [Romans 1:16]\n\nL-210 Now, friends, we come on down with man, down through the age, but we're past time.\n\nL-211 But let me say this. A man who has once come in contact with God, which is the Word, and the Word has been made plain and manifested to him, there is no shameness about that. You're not embarrassed. Doesn't embarrass me to say I believe every Word of God. Doesn't embarrass me when the Lord says to say anything, you go say it and do it. It don't embarrass me to say that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost. It don't embarrass me to say that I've spoke with other tongues. It don't embarrass me to say that our Lord has showed me visions. It don't embarrass me to say He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-212 \"When you're brought before rulers and kings, for My Name's sake, take no thought what you shall say, for it'll be 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min given to you in that hour. It's not you that speaketh, but My Father that dwelleth in you. But whosoever is ashamed of Me and My Word, in this generation, him will I be ashamed of before My Father and the holy Angels.\" God help us not to be ashamed, but help us to be a living testimony. [Matthew 10:19-20], [Mark 8:38]\n\nL-213 Every man in the Old Testament, when them prophets came, they become--they become the living Word. They was the Word. Jesus said they were called gods, and they were, because the Word of God came to them. They say, \"It's THUS SAITH THE LORD.\" [John 10:34]\n\nL-214 And any disciple of Christ who has come in contact with Him in redemption, and salvation has come into his heart, he is a possessor of God. And what kind of a life should we live, and how should we walk, and how should we talk, if God is representing Himself through our own mortal bodies? Who could be ashamed of that?\n\nL-215 If I come to a place that I was on the police force here in Jeffersonville, walk down the street, in all the authorities, I wouldn't be ashamed of the city. I would be part of the city. I would be a police, a part of the city, to keep order and conduct. If a man run a red light, I wouldn't be ashamed to tell him he done wrong, give him a ticket. That's my duty, 'cause I'm--I'm getting paid by the city. I'm living by the city. I have the authority from the city. No matter if he was drunk, or what was the matter with him, they'll back me up. I stand my grounds, 'cause I'm a policeman and or-... I'm ordained, or put in here and given authority to do this. You're supposed to take the law and rights, and things, and see that it's done right.\n\nL-216 Then, if I'm a Christian and been filled with the Spirit, wearing the testimony of Jesus Christ's resurrection, that He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, don't let any devil try to push you around, say, \"You don't do this and you don't do that.\" You do do It. God has give you the...\n\nL-217 See, we don't have power. That policeman don't have power to stop one car. It's about... sometime they're three or four hundred horsepower motor, what could he do about it? But he's got authority.\n\nL-218 And that's the Church. We have authority, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ and His promised Word, hallelujah, \"The things that I do shall you do also; more than this will you do, for I go unto the Father.\" [John 14:12]\n\nL-219 Don't be ashamed of Him in this generation; sinful, perplexed, the last generation that'll ever be on the earth, this sinful, adulterness, and full of all putrified sores. All, everything that's been decent has become indecent. National politics, filth! Nations are broke up.\n\nL-220 Way back in the jungles of Africa, on safari hunters, they had to take high-powered radios to hear Elvis Presley, Pat Boone, and them guys with that rock-and-roll and twist. And the natives, trying to see them act along, jerking their head and acting like that, the natives stood and looked at him. But, you see, they're not Americans like Pat Boone, and Elvis Presley, and Ricky Nelson, and them guys are. They're not Judases of that type, but they're... See, it's a spirit. And the spirit is not only in America, it has spread itself out over the world, to bring them to the battle of Armageddon. They act like that, whether they are... Whatever nation they come from, Africa, India, wherever it is, that vulgar and stuff has spread all over the earth, by just one man starting it.\n\nL-221 So has the Gospel and the Power of Almighty God, has spread around the world! And the separation time is now taking place, when God is a-calling a Bride, and the Devil is calling a church. Let me be part of the Bride! Let us pray.\n\nL-222 Dear God, we see the handwriting on the wall, Lord. We're at the end time. We know that there is great things laying ahead, but yet somewhere, somewhere out in this mess out here, is still honest people that's been ordained to Life. It would be impossible for one man or two man; but, God, all of us together, let us spread in every corner we can, the good news that Jesus is coming, and, see, just spread a little Bread along, a little Word. Wherever the Eagles are, they'll follow that Food. Whether It comes by a tape, or whether It comes by a word or a testimony, Eagles will follow It to Its headquarters. For It is written, \"Where the Carcass is, there the Eagles will gather.\" Dear Jesus, we know that Thou art the Carcass that we eat. Thou art the Word, and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. We pray, God, that as we scatter the Word, that the true Eagles will find It. [Matthew 24:28], [John 1:14]\n\nL-223 Let us not be ashamed when we stand before people, wicked, indifferent people, religious, whatever it is. As Paul 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min told Timothy: ... Let's be instant in season, out of season; reprove, and rebuke, and... with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they'll not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall... heap for themselves together teachers, having itching ears; And will be turned... from the truth,... to fables. [II Timothy 4:2-4]\n\nL-224 God, we're living in that day. You've let me live long enough to see that happen. As, that lays right here in the cornerstone of this tabernacle today, of thirty-three years ago.\n\nL-225 God, bless each one in here. If there be one in here, Lord, that's not ready to meet You, that they cannot just agree with Your Word, and they haven't met You face to face and know that You're not just by an act of some sort of a--of a--of an acception, like you would a creed or something, but has met the living God; and if they haven't did this, Lord, may they do it right now.\n\nL-226 I--I believe You are--You are real near at this hour. I don't know who they are. I don't know even if there is any here, but I just feel led to pray to You. Not that the people hear me, for that would be a hypocrite rite. God forbid. I don't want to be a hypocrite. But I pray it with the sincerity in my heart, Lord.\n\nL-227 Whoever he or she is that You speak to this morning, may they humbly not be ashamed, but way down deep in their heart receive You now, coming this evening and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, following every Word, every Word; if they've been baptized different, or sprinkled, poured. Remember (we do, Lord) that You said, \"Whosoever shall take one Word out of the Book, add one word to It, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.\" Though he tries, comes, puts his name on the book, it--it won't work. Let us be sincere and humble. [Revelation 22:19]\n\nL-228 Now they're in Your hands, Lord. You do with them as You see fit, for they're Yours. In the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\n\nL-229 Now while we have our heads bowed, I want you to think real seriously now. I apologize, first, for being about fifteen minutes late. Now we want to hum. And you just think in your heart now, \"Have I really met God?\" Just think it real sincerely now. Cause, it won't be too many times maybe until... May be the last time now, that we'll meet before His Coming. It's close, friends. Every Scripture, looks like, is just about fulfilled. And it might be, for you or I, this might be our last chance. We may be gone before night. I'll go with Him, with Him all the way. I can hear, \"Are you ashamed of Me and of My Word?\" I can hear my Saviour...\n\nL-230 Now just imagine you are laying on your deathbed now. \"Can hear...\" Then it might be too late, but it isn't right now. \"Take thy cross, and,\" might have to sacrifice now, \"follow Me.\" Now, in your heart, answer this: I'll go with Him through the garden, I'll go with Him through the garden, I'll go with Him through the garden, I'll go with Him, with Him all...\n\nL-231 Now with our heads bowed, let's just raise our hands and say: I'll go with Him through the judgment, Now, that's what's going on right now, He is judging us. I'll go... Lord, do You find me guilty? Then, forgive me. ... through His judgment, What do You judge me to be this morning, Lord? ... with Him through the judg-... 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min Try me, Lord, see if there be any unclean thing in me. ... with Him, with Him all the way.\n\nL-232 Father, we thank You this morning for all these hands. I didn't see one person but what they had their hands up. I thank You, Lord. I--I trust You didn't either, Lord. No one that didn't have their hands up, they are ready to go through the judgment. Judge us, Lord. And if there be any wrong in us, forgive us for it, Father. Give us of Your mercy, for we don't want to meet Your judgment when mercy is not present. So, mercy is present now, so we pray, God, that You will judge us and forgive us of our sins, according to Your Word and Your promise. And let us live for You all the days of our life, not being ashamed of the Gospel.\n\nL-233 Now, Father, if it's Your will, we're starting three straight Sundays now, of meetings. Prepare our hearts for it, Lord. Prepare me, O God. I'm the one that is standing so deeply in need of You. I pray that You will guide me and direct me in the things that I should do and say, in these days to come.\n\nL-234 Guide and direct our precious Brother Neville, that gallant servant of Yours, Lord; and also Brother Mann, and the deacons of the church, and the trustees, and every person that assembles here.\n\nL-235 Prepare us, Lord, that we might be able, in a--a real Christian way, to bring sinners to You, and to bring church members to a knowing the God that we know, that we have met personally, let Him become their God, too. Now, Father, this we cannot do, we cannot send them in. But Thou, Holy Spirit, move upon the people, the members of churches.\n\nL-236 And as the little experience I had with You the other morning, \"Go get my Son a Bride. Take It from among the people, among the churches. Pull out that Bride.\" Let me, in prayer now, Lord. You send the Rebekah; I'll try to be the Eliezer. Help me to be a faithful servant. And may the God of Heaven send His Angel before me, before us, that we will collect the things together and select the Bride that He has chosen. We ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-237 Now, I'm sorry to have kept you a little late. It's twenty-five after. I should have been out here, twenty-five minutes ago. But, now, you like that old song, \"Take The Name Of Jesus With You\"? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Ain't that pretty? I've sang that now for some thirty-three years, as a dismissing song. Water baptism, \"On Jordan's stormy banks I stand.\" And I think this is so pretty, \"Just take It everywhere you go!\" Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope... (Now shake hands with somebody by you.) Precious Name, precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven.\n\nL-238 Now remember the service of tonight, seven-thirty, seven-thirty tonight. Now let's sing just one verse, see. Take the Name of Jesus with you, As a shield from every snare; When temptations around you... (What do you do then?) Just breathe that holy Name in prayer. Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven; Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven.\n\nL-239 Was there any come to be baptized after this service? If so, raise your hands. Somebody to be baptized? Two, all right, to be baptized immediately after this service. If the rest of you, any of you that wants to be baptized, we'll have baptismal services at every one of these services. The only thing you have to do is ask. We're ready to baptize you. That's our duty, to baptize you in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. It's our duty to do it. And we'll be glad to do it, anytime. You that's to be baptized, just go to the rooms, immediately after the service, and we'll go right ahead with the water baptism. Anybody wants to follow them, you'd be sure that we're here... if you have repented of your sin and you've accepted Jesus as your Saviour. 65-0711, Ashamed, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 99 min\n\nL-240 You have been a Christian for years, and never seen the Light, and the Light of deliverance has come now. A woman, a Bride that must take the Name! Jesus said, \"I came in My Father's Name, and you received Me not. But there will be one come in his own name, and you'll receive him,\" that's your denomination. [John 5:43]\n\nL-241 Any son comes in his father's name. I come in my father's name. You man come in your father's name.\n\nL-242 And what was His Name, what is the Name of the Father? Jesus! He, \"came in My Father's Name, you received Me not.\" Now His Bride will have His Name, of course.\n\nL-243 I took a woman, by the name of Broy, and she become a Branham.\n\nL-244 He is coming for a Bride, be sure and remember that as you come to the pool. Let us bow our heads now.\n\nL-245 And Brother Vayle here is no stranger to us. He's a very precious brother, been with me in many meetings, him and his wife. And he is also now the writer of these sermons and things that goes into book form. Brother Vayle, would you dismiss us in prayer, while we bow our heads. [Brother Vayle prays--Ed.]\n\nL-246 [Brother William Marrion Branham expressed his desire to take the Message to Africa in this statement on Thursday evening, May 27, 1965, outside of a house in Johannesburg, South Africa, as an interpreter translated it into Afrikaans. He spoke about this Africa trip in his next Message, Ashamed, July 11, 1965. Due to its brevity (3 minutes, 40 seconds), it is placed here at the end of \"Ashamed.\"--Ed.] This is one of the highest moments of my life. I have waited fifteen years for this time. My heart has longed to see you again, ever since I left you. I have prayed very much, to get to come back. And a few weeks ago, I was under great anticipation, believing that I would get to come and have a meeting. But when I got the visa, \"restricted,\" I almost had a heart attack. I wanted to come so bad! But I still believe that, through God, I will minister again, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, among the people of Africa. God has promised to give us the desire of our heart, and that's one of the desires of my heart. I can remember the great meetings here in Johannesburg. I remember the boy with the short leg, coming long again, normal. And the lady, that the little girl was healed from a back condition, and her mother fainted and fell back in the--the cot. [The interpreter speaks in English, \"Brother Branham, that was my wife's cousin.\"--Ed.] Your wife... Oh! There is so many great things! No doubt, there is many of those people, attended those meetings, are with the Lord now. I have gotten old, too, since then. It won't be too long till my time to go up, then we will be together forever, no visaes. I feel like bringing the Message. But it is written in the Scripture, \"Give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" I'm expecting to meet you here in a few moments, shake your hand and have fellowship again together. I appreciate all these fine men. I wish I had all my brethren, in Africa, here today, of all the denominations, that we could just get together and talk, all evening. And I would like to hear what the Lord has been doing over here for you. I would like to tell you what He's doing for us across the sea. Maybe He will permit that, some day. Until that day, I'll be praying for you, and you be praying for me. God bless you. [Matthew 22:21], [Mark 12:17], [Luke 20:25] Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

How, now this way: Now I believe, now I believe, All things are possible, now I believe; Now I believe, now I believe, All things are possible, now I believe. Let's remain standing now, with our heads bowed. Lord, may this not only be a song, but be the very depths of our heart singing out, \"Now I believe!\" The disciples said one time, after Jesus had done so many mighty works, they said, \"Lord, now we believe.\" Jesus said, \"Do you now believe?\" [John 16:30-31]\n\nL-2 They said, \"We believe that Thou knowest all things and need that no man teach Thee.\" So, Father, tonight we realize that You don't need our teaching, but we need Yours. So we pray that You'll teach us how to pray, how to live, and how to believe. Grant it, Lord, through this service tonight. If we lack anything, give it to us, Lord. We ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. [John 16:30-31]\n\nL-3 I know many of you are standing again tonight. And, outside, met groups that said they couldn't get in, and they're listening to their radio in the different cars. And now we'll try to make just as quick as we can tonight, on Sunday night, we give over to pray for the sick, have a prayer line as we can get one up here. But we are dedicating this service tonight for prayer for the sick.\n\nL-4 And I want you to get built up now in the... this Holy Oracles of God, in the Faith, the Faith of this hour. The Faith! It's going to take more faith than ever was in any age, for this has to be rapturing faith, be taken up. And so we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen, heard, the Word that you have heard preached, the--the signs and wonders that you have seen done. We want you to accumulate all that together in your heart, and consider it, whether if that be God or not.\n\nL-5 Is like Elisha of old, said, \"If God be God, then serve Him.\" And if Jesus is the center of all things to the Christian, then I think we ought to let loose of everything else and cleave to Him. Remember, He is the Center, He is the North Star, He is the Ultimate, He is the Absolute. And if He is the North Star... There's only one thing that'll point to the north star, that's your compass that you're sailing with. And the Compass that I'm trying you to sail with is the Word, and the Word always points to Him. [I Kings 18:21]\n\nL-6 And we feel like that we're going through a great time of distress and trials, perplexity of the time and distress between the nations, and all kinds of things happening, and sometimes I get engulfed like... Everywhere I look, it's like on a... in a ship out on the sea. And I've been give charge of the Boat. And how we going to make it? And here comes one with a white cap, hundred times bigger than my ship. But we'll crest them, every one. \"We are more than victors through Him.\" The Captain, the Chief Captain, has got a hold of the string on the end of the ship, He'll pull it through. We'll crest every one of them.\n\nL-7 Now, tonight, so we can hurry and let you get out early. We appreciate your long drives, and so forth, and how you have to drive, and the sacrifice you have to make. And, see, that makes me to where I'd just like to stand and just keep talking and doing everything I can to help you. But when I'm here I try to press in everything that I possibly can, to give help for that moment that we're now here. Then you take... If you give people too much at a time they can't remember it. You--you've got to just take one thing and hold it right to the person until they see that. And then when 65-0718E, Spiritual Food In Due Season, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 89 min they get that solid in their heart, then they'll... then teach them something else. Just step by step as we go.\n\nL-8 Now, you pray and be of a good courage, and believe now tonight for healing. I don't think there's any question in your mind about the time we're living. I don't believe there's a question in your mind about whether God is in the midst of His people or not. I believe you all believe that. And I... There's no doubt in my mind about it. And I--I--I know my people, my friends, the friends of Christ, the children of--of Christ, believe that.\n\nL-9 And it gives me great pleasure to get to see when you know that you have a Message from God, and you give it to the people and see the people respond to That. Then you look back and say, \"Thank You, Father.\" Oh, what a joy it is then to see the children eating the Bread that's been sent to them! You realize that was a vision years ago, right here at this Tabernacle? That's right, \"The Bread of Life.\" Brother Neville, you remember it, might. Mighty time!\n\nL-10 Now let us turn, if you want to follow the reading or mark it down, just... I don't believe it would be appropriate to have a service without reading God's Word and passing a few comments, if it's going to be a healing service or any kind. We all understand. There's no strangers among us, I suppose. But we all understand what healing is. It's nothing that somebody does for you; it's what God has already done for you. Salvation is on the same line. The only thing, is, to get the people to believe that's the Truth. And God teaches it in His Word and then proves it to them who will believe It, for He said, \"All things are possible to them that believe.\" [Isaiah 53:5]\n\nL-11 You say, \"There's nothing impossible with God.\" You believe that? There's nothing impossible with you, either. \"For all things are possible to them,\" (God is one Person) \"to them that believe.\" See? So there's nothing impossible with you, for you, if you can only believe. [Mark 9:23]\n\nL-12 Now in First Kings, the 17th chapter, I want to read the first seven verses, the Lord willing. And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, Get thee hence, and turn eastward, turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shall drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. Notice, \"feed thee there,\" not somewhere else. \"There!\" So he went and did according unto the LORD, or the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. [I Kings 17:1-7]\n\nL-13 The Lord add His blessings to the reading of His Word. And now, tonight, I want to take a text from there, that's called, \"spiritual Food in Its season.\" This morning we had a--a lesson on--on \"Doing God a service, or trying to do Him a service without being... -out being the time, the season, the place, or the person.\" And now this is: Spiritual Food In Due Season.\n\nL-14 This prophet, Elijah, we know very little about him. But we know that he was God's servant, and the servant of God for that hour.\n\nL-15 And God has used His Spirit that was upon Elijah, already three times, and promises twice more; five times, for grace. He used It upon Elijah; It came on Elisha in a double portion; was on John the Baptist; and supposed to come just to issue in the Gentile Bride; and come with Moses to take the Jews home. That's right. Five times that God promises to use the Spirit of Elijah, and already done it three times.\n\nL-16 Now, this great prophet, we don't know where he come from. We know he was a Tishbite. But how he come...\n\nL-17 We know little about the prophets. We don't know where they come from. Very seldom... As, I don't know of any 65-0718E, Spiritual Food In Due Season, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 89 min that come out of the church or had any genealogy behind them. It was just ordinary man that was fearless, and, many times, uneducated. And they never done any writing, themselves. Isaiah and Jeremiah, a couple of them, done some writings, but this great man Elijah never wrote one thing. Many of them didn't write; maybe they couldn't write. But they were man that were rugged. There's no man in the Bible like those ancient prophets. They defied kingdoms, kings, peoples, churches, and everything else, and stood firm on the Word of God, and God proved them to be right. They were very rugged individuals.\n\nL-18 And this Elijah was one of the ruggedest of all of them. He was a man of the wilderness. He came out of the wilderness; he lived in the wilderness. The Bible said he dressed hairy. He had sheepskin wrapped around him, and a piece of leather, of camel skin wrapped around his loins, very... whiskers over his face, and I'd imagine he was a very rugged-looking man, and to look at.\n\nL-19 But we didn't... they all didn't all die. They're not all--all dead. In the days of the Nicene Council... many of you people that's read The Nicene Council of the Early Church, when they wanted to make an organization out of it and break up all the other churches, and come into one, when they had that Nicene Council, rugged man like Elisha come in there from the wilderness, eating herbs alone; great rugged man. But the dignitaries, the high-ups, under Constantine, and so forth, stilled their voice. Because those, being prophets, knowed that the corn of wheat of the Church Bride had to fall in the ground, the same as a corn of wheat in the Bridegroom had to fall in the ground. And there it laid for a thousand years.\n\nL-20 That's why they write in the books today, \"Where is that silent God that could stand and look, see little children murdered, and women tore to pieces by lions, and sit in the skies and say nothing about it?\" They don't know the Word. That corn of wheat's got to fall in the earth. How could a righteous God stand and look at His Own Son die and be spit on, and so forth? But it's according to the Word, it has to be. And that's the way it is even to this hour. [John 12:24]\n\nL-21 This man, he was a great man. He had a sinful generation before him. Ahab was king, his father before him had been evil. Ever since Solomon, there just been one evil king after the other. And this man, Ahab, who reigned twenty-two years in Samaria, was the worst of all of them. He was a real modernist. He believed in religion, certainly. And he had everything in a modern trend. He had his four hundred Hebrew prophets, all of them well-schooled and trained. God sent him one and he wouldn't believe it, and that was Elijah. [I Kings 16:29], [I Kings 18:19]\n\nL-22 But Elijah, this Tishbite, was a man of the wilderness. Not a smooth man; he was a rugged man. And one day, after Ahab had sinned until God could stand it no more, He spoke to Elijah in the wilderness. And here he comes down the road to Samaria, as I've often illustrated; maybe the white whiskers sticking out around his face, bald head shining in the sun, little old narrow eyes, back there with a stick in his hand, a smile in his face, walked right up to the king of Israel, and said, \"The... Not even dew will fall till I call for it.\" [I Kings 17:1]\n\nL-23 God give us man like that, see, man who know what they're doing with THUS SAITH THE LORD.\n\nL-24 Now, we find out that before he did this, that God had called him. God had talked to him and, therefore, he wasn't afraid of anything. He wasn't afraid of his message, it wouldn't happen; he knowed it would happen! He knowed it was according to the Word of the Lord, and he knowed he was God's prophet for the hour. Therefore whether the king would cut his head off, throw him in jail, whatever they'd do, it made no difference to him; he had a commission, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD,\" right in the face of the king. What a rugged person! But before he did this, predicted this great drought... [I Kings 18:36]\n\nL-25 For God will not let sin go unpunished. There must be punishment. What good is a law without a--a punishment? What would it do good, say, \"it's against the law to run the light,\" and no fine behind it, or no punishment behind it? It wouldn't be a law. So there's a punishment to sin. And when God makes a law, and that law--law is defied, then there's got to be punishment for that. [Numbers 32:23]\n\nL-26 And this nation had violated all of His laws. Oh, they had big church, they had the temple. They had plenty of educated man. They had prophets all over the country, had schools of them, turning them out like a machine. And they had plenty of prophets, they had plenty of--of priests, they had plenty of scribes, and they had plenty of religion, but 65-0718E, Spiritual Food In Due Season, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 89 min they were away from the Word of God. So God called a man outside of any of their ranks at all, and sent him in with THUS SAITH THE LORD.\n\nL-27 And notice how He cares for His Own. Before He sent this prophet with the message, He said, \"Elijah, go down and tell King Ahab these things. And now, when you do, get yourself away from him right quick, for I have made a place for you to go during the drought. I'm going to take care of you, Elijah, if you just preach My Word, do just what I tell you to do.\" [I Kings 17:3-4]\n\nL-28 Now I'm going to type this great ministry, tonight, of Elijah and the time of Elijah, with the hour that we're now in. I believe It's a perfect type. I think of the nations... if I... we had time to go back, but I want to put plenty of time in the prayer line.\n\nL-29 So if we could go back and see, Israel had taken Palestine upon the same basis that we took this United States. We come into this United States and drove back the occupants, which was the Indians, and possessed the land. And so did Israel come into Palestine, under leadership of Joshua, under God, and drove back the occupants and took the land.\n\nL-30 And their first kings were mighty man; David, Solomon, and great man. Our first presidents were great man; Washington, Lincoln, and so forth. Then finally the presidents or the kings become getting more rotten all the time, and finally they ended up with this Ahab. Very type, typical of our day. And the people had got so modern they didn't want to hear the true Word of the Lord.\n\nL-31 And you can imagine, on a modern people like that, what a real true servant of God would sound like to them. \"Why, he was crazy, he was out of his mind. There couldn't be such a thing.\" They were religious, very religious. They had sincere man, they had sincere people. They was very religious.\n\nL-32 So he knew that it would take more than just a ordinary theology, it would take more than--than any ordinary message, it would take more than just preaching the Word, to crack their stony hearts. He knowed it took THUS SAITH THE LORD to send that judgment down upon that people, so he knowed that when he went out with THUS SAITH THE LORD. And it was THUS SAITH THE LORD. To spurn That, was judgment. We see that in our day, too. We see that in any day. There's nothing left but judgment when you step over the line of mercy.\n\nL-33 Now, that type there, that, I'm going to type Elijah with the church today, the church of today. Just before judgment, he received this message. Elijah, he represented, being cared for in the natural, his natural food, because it wasn't going to rain now, according to the Word of God, for three years and six months, or until Elijah called for it. \"Whatever time you say, Elijah, that's what it'll be.\" Therefore he walked up to the king, and said, \"There'll not even be dew fall till I call for it.\" That's quite a--a load, isn't it? That's quite a message!\n\nL-34 And now we're going to type that with the spiritual drought of today. Now, we all know, we are very aware, that there is a great spiritual drought in the land today, spiritually speaking. And, you know, that was predicted by the prophets, just before the second Coming of Christ would be, said, \"There will come a famine in the land, and it won't be for bread alone, but for the hearing of the Word of God.\" And that day is now, \"hearing the true Word of God.\" Now, this types the natural drought with the spiritual. [Amos 8:11]\n\nL-35 Sin and unbelief, by false teachers and modernists in the church, had brought the place to this coming, oncoming judgment. Then they had turned from God's Word and His prophet, to a modern theological terms of the Word.\n\nL-36 You notice here, it's just at that time that God always raises up something. Cause, He, always, He does nothing until first He reveals it to the people, and He always reveals it by His servants. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-37 Now, but Elijah, during this time, had a secret place that God had ordained for him to go to. That's the thing we want to see now just before we have the prayer line. Elijah had a secret place provided by God Himself. Now, the church never provided it for him, the king never provided it for him, he didn't provide hisself, but God provided a secret place for Elijah to be fed all the time during the drought, where his food was provided day by day. He didn't need to wonder what's going to happen tomorrow or wonder if the supply run out. God said, \"I have commanded the ravens and they'll feed you.\" What a wonderful thing, a type of our secret place in Christ. [I Kings 17:4] 65-0718E, Spiritual Food In Due Season, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 89 min\n\nL-38 When the world council and all that's going on today, that says, \"The days of miracles is past.\" The great powers of God has been taken out of the churches. They seem like, anymore, they don't have nothing but \"a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.\" We know that to be the truth. \"And form of godliness, and denying the Power thereof.\" [II Timothy 3:5]\n\nL-39 It's just the same thing that David did this morning, with the ox carts, got away from the Word. When the Word was presented and give to them, they did not want It; therefore, they had gotten away from It. [I Chronicles 13:7-14]\n\nL-40 That's what these people had done in the days of Elijah, gotten away from the Word. They thought they had the Word, but they didn't have It. So notice then in the...\n\nL-41 During the time that He was going to punish the unbeliever, He made a way for the believer. The same thing He does each time. In the days when He was going to destroy the world by water, He made a way of escape for Noah. In the days that He was going to drown Egypt, He made a way of escape across the sea for His people. How God makes His way! And where there is no way, He is that Way. He is that Way!\n\nL-42 Now we realize that we are facing some of the... one of the greatest hours that history has ever known. It isn't exactly the warhead with the bright shiny missile, with a head on it, that we should be afraid of. It's the churches we should be afraid of. It's the hour that we're living that we should watch.\n\nL-43 Now notice, but God made a way for Elijah to escape it. And He has made a way for His believing children to escape it now, the wrath and things that is to come. [I Kings 17:2-3]\n\nL-44 Because, God could not be just to judge those people and send them punishment, and sink Sodom and Gomorrah, and sink Capernaum in the middle of the sea, and condemn those generations, and Sodom and Gomorrah, and then let us do the same thing and get by with it. We're just as sure for judgment as they were sure for judgment. Now we notice that the... [Matthew 11:23], [Genesis 19:24]\n\nL-45 When these things come up, the modern trend of that day, God rose up a man in that day, or raised up a man, rather, to combat the forces, and they wouldn't listen to it. They thought he was crazy, \"He had lost his mind. He was just some old fanatic, fool from the wilderness, kinda bush-crazed.\" But, yet, he had the Word of the Lord.\n\nL-46 \"The Word doesn't mean what It says,\" they say today. \"Oh, well, the Bible is a history book.\" I guess you've seen this, that now they claim, that, \"Eve didn't eat the apple, she eat a...\" What was it? I believe...\"It was a apricot,\" they say now. \"It was an apricot.\" And then, that, \"Moses never brought the children through the Red Sea. It was a big bunch of reeds, up the other end of that sea, and he went through a sea of reeds.\" Then how did the water, w-a-t-e-r, wall up on both sides; they went through on dry land, then? Oh, such nonsense! But, you see, it takes that kind of a day to bring God's wrath down upon the people. It does it.\n\nL-47 They say there's no such a thing as--as these... Even church people don't believe in miracles. \"I'll give you a thousand dollars,\" they said, \"show me a miracle. Show me a miracle!\" Well, they couldn't see it if there was ten thousand things done before them. Why, they, they'd never see it. You say, \"That's the impossible.\" Oh, no, it isn't.\n\nL-48 Elijah one time was down at Dothan, and the Syrian army had come over and surrounded the city, to take him, because they knowed that's where the--the nation's power laid, was in that seer. Why, the king... One of the man told the king of Syria, said, \"Why, you know, Elijah the prophet, the Tishbite, tells the king of Israel what you talk about in your secret chamber.\" [II Kings 6:8-12]\n\nL-49 Said, \"Go get that guy! That's the fellow that's hindering us.\" And the whole Syrian army slipped in around Dothan. They was all around it. [II Kings 6:13-14]\n\nL-50 And Gehazi, the--the servant of the prophet, woke up, and he said, \"Oh, my father, the armies is all around us here. We're completely surrounded.\" [II Kings 6:15]\n\nL-51 He said, \"Why, there is more with us than there is with them.\" See? And Gehazi looked around, said, \"I don't see nobody.\" [II Kings 6:16-17] 65-0718E, Spiritual Food In Due Season, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 89 min\n\nL-52 He said, \"Lord God, open up that boy's eyes.\" And his eyes opened up, and all the hills was full of Angels and chariots sitting around, the unseen Forces. [II Kings 6:16-17]\n\nL-53 Elijah walked right out there, and the Bible said, \"He smote them blind.\" He walked out to them; they were blind to him. Walked out and said, \"Are you looking for Elijah?\" He said, \"Yes, we're looking for him.\" [II Kings 6:18-19] Said, \"Come on, tell you right where he's at,\" and led them right into ambush, right straight where the armies walked right out and got them.\n\nL-54 Now, the Bible said, \"He smote them blind.\" That settles it. And people are so spiritual blind today, though the Lord God come down in the midst of the people and do anything, and the things He promised, they still can't see It. They are spiritually blind; don't know God, don't know His great Power. Now, we notice that they did that in the days of Elijah, and they still do it today. God smites them blind. They say today, that, \"There is no miracles, there is no such a thing, all this is emotion.\" [II Kings 6:18-20]\n\nL-55 And they said the same thing about Elijah, because when he was taken up and Elisha took his place, a young man, went bald-headed young, the children run out behind him, and said, \"Old baldhead, why didn't you go up with Elijah?\" See, they didn't even believe It in the beginning, the people, after so many things had been done. And this great man of God had been translated into Heaven by a chariot of fire, and the people still didn't believe It. And had their little children run behind this man and say, \"Old baldhead, why didn't you go up?\" See? And then the prophet cursed the children, and a she bear killed forty-two of them. [II Kings 2:23]\n\nL-56 Now notice. Today, as it was then, they put their own interpretation to the Word. Now, if they want to do that, that's up to them, but they try to make us believe it. The Bible said that, \"This Word of God is of no private interpretation.\" God does His Own interpretating. God confirms His Word, and that's the interpretation of It. As I many times said, He said in the beginning, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. That don't need to be interpreted; it happened. He said, \"A virgin would conceive,\" she did. He said He'd \"pour out His Spirit,\" He did. And He said, \"in the last days,\" the things that He would do, and He's doing it! It don't need any interpretation; God is doing His Own interpretating. No matter what foolish man say, that doesn't stop God a bit. [II Peter 1:20], [Genesis 1:3], [Isaiah 7:14]\n\nL-57 When Jesus was on earth, He had as much unbelief to contend with that we have today, and maybe more. But it didn't stop Him; He went right on performing and carrying out His duty, and God confirming everything He done. He said, \"I'm not by Myself. My Father and I are one; He dwells in Me. It ain't Me that doeth the works, it's the Father that dwelleth in Me. And if I do not His works, then don't believe Me; but if I do the works and yet you can't believe Me, believe the works.\" See? In other words, they...\"Search the Scriptures,\" He said, \"for that's where you think you got Eternal Life, is by knowing the Scriptures. And the Scriptures, Itself, testifies of Me.\" Amen! What a statement! \"They are they, the Scriptures, that tell you Who I am,\" Jesus said. [John 5:39]\n\nL-58 And it's the Scriptures that tell you the hour that we're living. And the things that you see done, it's God Himself among His people. Nothing can raise the dead but God. Nothing can do the things that He's doing now but Him. For the Bible said, \"He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-59 Now we see that modern trend of the people, then, \"Oh, the days are past, there's no such a thing as miracles. The people are all emotionally worked up.\"\n\nL-60 Listen to that Elijah, the prophet, cry out against them and their theologians. Notice, notice, he spoke as if he was God Himself. Elijah spoke as if he was God Himself, \"The dew will not fall from heaven until I call for it.\" Amen! Yes, sir. The prophet had been so long in the Presence of God! [I Kings 17:1]\n\nL-61 The prophets of the Old Testament, or any time, when they lived in the Presence of God until they become the Word, their Message is the Word Itself. And, remember, he said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD.\" And when those man had those messages from God, and they become so wrapped up that their own thinking... It might have been against their thinking, they might not have been able to--to see it right. But they was speaking the Word of God, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD.\" 65-0718E, Spiritual Food In Due Season, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 89 min\n\nL-62 \"There will not be any rain till I call for it.\" Oh, what a statement! He had been in the Presence of God and been vindicated so perfect. And, remember, that also follows Amos 3:7, \"The Lord God will do nothing until first He reveals it to His servants the prophets.\" Said, \"There's not going to be any rain fall!\" He first... [I Kings 17:1]\n\nL-63 They laughed at him, they thought he was crazy, \"That fanatic!\" But, see, he had THUS SAITH THE LORD that it wasn't going to rain. And, God, before he did that, He revealed it to Elijah His servant. And he was a vindicated, proven prophet, so the people ought to have repented. But, instead of that, they laughed at him, said, \"Oh, we got plenty of rain! The reservoirs are full. The rivers are running good.\" [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-64 The Bible said that, \"There was not even dew for three years and six months.\" All the brooks and waters dried up, everywhere. That wasn't that man, that was God speaking through that man. That was the \"I\" it was. We always know. So he... [James 5:17]\n\nL-65 We find out that when a man comes, sent from God, ordained of God, with the true THUS SAITH THE LORD, the message and the messenger are one and the same. Because he is sent to represent THUS SAITH THE LORD, Word by Word, so he and his message is the same. [I Kings 17:1]\n\nL-66 A denominational man under denominational auspices, he and the church is the \"one.\" A theologian under theology, made by some denomination, he and his message are one; church of theology, a theologian. It's correctly.\n\nL-67 Then when a man comes with THUS SAITH THE LORD, he and the Message is one. And when Elijah come with THUS SAITH THE LORD, he and his message became one. Just as Jesus, when He come, He was the Word, Saint John 1. So the Word of God and the messenger of the age was the selfsame thing, all the time. That's right. [I Kings 17:1]\n\nL-68 Jesus was the Word that was prophesied of. He was what the prophets said would happen, \"A virgin shall conceive and bear this Child.\" Way back in the beginning, God told them, said, \"The woman's Seed shall bruise the serpent's head, and he'll bruise her heel.\" All these prophecies had been given. David crying, all the rest of the prophets down through the ages, speaking of Him. He was that Word manifested! Hallelujah! [Genesis 3:15]\n\nL-69 Now do you see where I'm trying to get to? I spoke with you pretty plain this morning. Don't you see the authority of the living God in the living Church, the Bride? The sick are healed, the dead are raised up, the cripples walk, the blind see, the Gospel goes forth in Its power, for the Message and the messenger are the same. The Word is in the Church, in the person.\n\nL-70 The Word of God was in Elijah when he walked up there with THUS SAITH THE LORD, and said, \"It isn't going to rain.\" That wasn't Elijah; that was God in Elijah. [I Kings 17:1]\n\nL-71 I said a many time, like the Christian Science lady that told me one time. I've told it many times about it. She said, \"Mr. Branham, you put too much bragging on Jesus.\" I said, \"I hope that's the only thing I've got to answer for.\" And she said, \"You try to make Him Divine.\" I said, \"He was Divine.\" Said, \"Oh, He was a prophet, He was a good man, but He wasn't Divine.\" And I said, \"Well, show me one Scripture that says He wasn't.\" She said, \"In the Book of Saint John, it says that He 'wept' when He went to the grave of Lazarus.\" [John 11:34-35]\n\nL-72 \"Well,\" I said, \"sure, He wept. He was both human and Divine. He was a man, weeping; but He had to be God to raise the dead.\" That's right. I said, \"He was a man, hungry; but He was God feeding five thousand, with a couple biscuits and five fishes.\" That's right. \"He was a man, sleeping on the back of a boat; but it was God in Him that could still the waters.\" For why? He and His Message was one. [John 11:33-45]\n\nL-73 He said, \"I and My Father are one. My Father dwelleth in Me.\" He was the fulness of the Godhead bodily. [John 10:30]\n\nL-74 I think it was so striking the other day, when I was bringing The Seven Church Ages. To start off with, I--I couldn't make out Jesus standing there with those... with that white over Him like that, said, \"His hair was white as 65-0718E, Spiritual Food In Due Season, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 89 min wool.\" I couldn't understand how a man thirty-three years old would be snow white. [Revelation 1:14]\n\nL-75 I called a good theologian, Pentecostal theologian, a good dear friend. Well, it was Brother Jack Moore. He's smart, intelligent man. He said, \"Brother Branham, that was Jesus glorified. That's what He looked like after He was glorified.\" No, I couldn't believe that. No. I--I--I said, \"Well, Brother Moore, thank you.\"\n\nL-76 I got in the room there and got to speaking to God. I run my concordance to take Him back to Daniel, where it said, \"And he came to the Ancient of Days Whose hair was white as wool.\" I said, \"Lord, I--I--I don't know what to say, and I've got the responsibility.\" Now, that was before the se-... and remember, before the Seven Seals was opened, about a year or more, before. I was praying there, \"Lord, what was it?\" [Daniel 7:9]\n\nL-77 And I looked, standing before me, and there stood a man and he was a judge, and he had a white wig on. The old judges of ancient days used to wear a white wig to show that he was a supreme authority.\n\nL-78 And then when I seen Jesus with the white wig, I said it only vindicates the truth that we know, that He is the Supreme Authority. God witnessed the same thing on Mount Transfiguration, said, \"This is My beloved Son, hear Him, the Supreme Authority!\" [Matthew 17:1-5], [Revelation 1:14]\n\nL-79 Then back out there at the beginning of the Seven Seals, when those seven Angels come down in that pyramid form, stood there and told me to return back here and speak on those Seven Seals, and He'd be with me, He'd show me what they were, the lost things. I always thought it was sealed on the back of the Book and it'd be something wasn't wrote in the Book, but it turned out that it was made known that He cannot do that. It isn't something that's written in the Book... It's something that's been hid in the Book. \"For whosoever shall take one Word from It or add one word to It...\" So it is a mystery that's been in the Book in these seven church ages. Each one of them produced a--a mystery, all about water baptism and these other things that they've fumbled about so long. [Revelation 22:18-19], [Revelation 10:7]\n\nL-80 Then when that went up, the big observatories from way down in California, plumb down in Mexico, over Tucson, everywhere, taking the picture of It. It was a mysterious sight. Brother Fred Sothmann there, sitting right back there, and I and Brother Gene Norman, standing right there present when it went up. They took the picture, still they don't know what about it. Here sometime ago, everybody saying, \"Looky here. This looks like this, and them Angels' wings, how they're folded in there.\"\n\nL-81 One day, turning it to the right, looking, there was Jesus Christ just as perfect as Hofmann ever drawed Him. It was standing there with a white wig on, looking back down towards the earth, showing that He is Supreme Authority. The Heavens declare it, the Bible declares it, the Message declares it, all the same. Supreme Authority, with the white wig on; you see His black beard under. Many of you have seen the picture. We got it back there. Just turn it to the right, sideways, look at it. There He is, just as perfect as it was, if it had been photographed of Him. They're looking at it from the wrong angle. You got to look at it in the right angle. And only the Lord God can reveal which is the right angle. Turn it to your right and look at it. There He is, just as perfect, had it a-been photographed up there. [Revelation 1:14]\n\nL-82 The first time I ever seen Him, He looked like the Head of... Hofmann. I had never seen that before. And in Billy Sunday's tabernacle, years later, I saw it. My house has never been without one of the pictures since.\n\nL-83 Then, here in the skies, saying that the very God that I saw up in this vision out here, just a little boy out here by where this schoolhouse stands, He looked like that. And here in the Heavens, thirty-three years later, declare it, that it's the truth. That's the way He looks; not some mystic something of somebody's idea.\n\nL-84 Like in the Vatican, they got a--a--a Christ drawed over there, with a little white ring of beard or a ring of beard around His chin, about a half inch long, runs right around the top of His mouth and like this, and call that the Christ.\n\nL-85 That just puts me in mind of a Greek artist I seen one time in an ancient cathedral, showing what Adam and Eve looked like; they looked like beasts or something. That's what the carnal mind can perceive of some spiritual thing. I think Adam was the most handsome man that ever lived, and Eve was a perfect woman in every way. 65-0718E, Spiritual Food In Due Season, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 89 min\n\nL-86 Now carnal minds wraps up the Thing in their own ideas, then God sends down and unfolds the Thing by His Power. That's exactly what took place here in the days of Ahab.\n\nL-87 Now, we find out that Elijah could say that because the Message of the hour and the Word of God... The messenger, the Message--the Message, and the Word, was exactly the same thing. The prophet, the Word, the Message; messenger, Message, and Message, was the same. Jesus said, \"If I do not the works that's written of Me, then don't believe Me.\" That's good. Any man and his message is one. [John 10:37-38], [Amos 3:7], [I Kings 17:1]\n\nL-88 That's why today that they do not believe in doing the works of God, because they do not accept the Message of God. They don't believe the Message.\n\nL-89 But those who believe God's hour that we're living in, these things are hidden Food. Just think, God has so hid It that they look right at It and don't see It. The same way that Elijah blinded the Syrian army. The same way that God blinds the unbeliever from the true genuine Food of the child, the believer. [II Kings 6:18-20]\n\nL-90 What they called Noah, \"a fanatic,\" building an ark, his eyes were open to the Word of God and the promise. The very thing that they called fanaticism, saved Noah and his family. See, the very same thing. The thing that people laugh at, is the thing that we pray for. The thing that people calls \"crazy,\" we call \"Great!\" What the world calls \"great,\" God calls \"foolish.\" And what the world calls \"foolish,\" God calls \"Great!\" It's just exactly the contrast between the Right and wrong. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. [Genesis 6:14], [Genesis 7:1-5]\n\nL-91 Remember, he went into his secret place by the plan of God, by the call of God, and the Word of God. Elijah entered into his secret place by God's foreknowledge (plan), and the call upon his life, and according to the Word. If that ain't the way we entered, I don't know why we get there. [I Kings 17:2-5]\n\nL-92 And notice, before the drought begin, Elijah went into this place of secret for his living. A very type of before the judgment starts to strike the earth, the Church is already called out, the Bride is already chosen, and just waiting before the judgment strikes. Already waiting, eating the Food of God, enjoying the blessings of God. Any man in his normal mind knows that we're headed straight, we're right in the hour of judgment. [I Kings 17:2-16]\n\nL-93 Look! Brother Banks, several of you man that's here tonight, that standing out there on that mountain that morning.\n\nL-94 And I want to speak about that mountain, next Sunday morning, the Lord willing. Got a great revelation, something further that I can't hardly keep from telling it tonight. But I have... See? And it just constantly, all the time, one thing happening after the other. See? It'll never stop happening, for it was THUS SAITH THE LORD.\n\nL-95 Every one of you here, thousands times thousands over the tape, heard me stand and say, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD, it will be thus and thus.\" And even the newspapers and magazines have to declare it to be the so. They don't know what it's all about, but they seen it. They don't know what it is, but they seen it making the Word exactly the truth.\n\nL-96 We was standing down here on the river, that Angel of the Lord came down that day, thirty-three years, or 1933 it was, come down and spoke the things that He did. Walked out, and many man stand upon the bank there, said, \"What did that mean, Billy?\"\n\nL-97 I said, \"That wasn't for me; that was for you. I believe; you don't.\" And just went walking on.\n\nL-98 Then the pastor said to me, he said, \"You mean that you, with a seventh-grade education, is going to go all over the world and pray for monarchs and potentates and kings and things? And, oh,\" said, \"forget It!\"\n\nL-99 I couldn't forget It, It was engraved upon my heart. Now here, thirty-three years later, everything He said has happened perfectly the way He said He would do it. He's God and can't fail. He always keeps His Word. He... Don't never doubt It.\n\nL-100 Now, notice, he went in by the plan of God (foreknowledge), call of God, and the Word of God, and went in before the drought set in. Now, we know that judgment is ready to strike.\n\nL-101 Standing on the hill that day, Brother Banks Woods standing here, we was walking up the hill. Maybe I quote it 65-0718E, Spiritual Food In Due Season, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 89 min again, so that build your faith for this prayer line that's fixing to take place in the next ten, fifteen minutes. I was just walking ahead of Brother Banks. He was... I think he had left Sister Ruby when she was sick. And he coming behind me, I noticed his face, red. I looked back. I thought the hill might be a little hard for him to pull, so I kind of slowed up. Right in them deserts, right up hills like that, right where the Angels of the Lord appeared. We was heading right in that direction then, where they appeared a few months before that.\n\nL-102 And as I went up the hill, the Spirit of God... When I turned around, look on top of the mountain, He said, \"Pick up that rock, and say to him, 'THUS SAITH THE LORD, you'll see the Glory of God in the next few hours.'\"\n\nL-103 I just picked up the rock, and said, \"Brother Banks, I don't know why,\" throwed it up the air, and I said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD, you're going to see the Glory of God.\" He said, \"That meant Ruby?\"\n\nL-104 I said, \"No, I don't think it had anything to do with you, Banks or Ruby, either one. I just think It was just saying, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD, something's going to happen.\"\n\nL-105 And the next morning when we were standing there, many of the men, I don't know how many is sitting here now, there was twelve or fourteen, fifteen of us sitting there. All of a sudden, a minister walked up to me and he said, \"Brother Branham,\" he said, \"my name is So-and-so.\" Said, \"I was one of your sponsors in California.\"\n\nL-106 I said, \"I'm glad to meet you, sir.\" Douglas McHughes. He said, \"I'm...\" I said, \"I'm glad to meet you.\" Shook hands with him.\n\nL-107 He said, \"Well, now, I want to ask you a question.\" Said... Roy Roberson, trustee here; Brother Woods, Terry and Billy, and, oh, Brother Mc Anally, and I don't know who all was standing there. And I... He said, \"I want to ask you something.\" He said, \"Does the Lord ever give you visions out like this?\"\n\nL-108 I said, \"Yes, brother, but I come out here to kind of get away from it, to rest up.\" And I looked around like this, and I seen a heavyset doctor looking at him, said, \"Rev. McHughes, this allergy in your eye will soon put your eye out. I've doctored you for two years, and I can do nothing about it.\" And I turned around to him. I said, \"What you asked me that for, your doctor told you, the other day, 'That allergy was in your eye.'\" It was middle of the day, about eleven o'clock, and he was wearing sunglasses. And I said, \"The reason; you're not wearing that because it's the sun, it's because of your eye. He told you you was 'going to lose that eye.'\" And he started crying, said, \"That's right.\"\n\nL-109 I turned to walk around again, had a shovel in my hand. (And I looked; I seen him standing there looking at me, his eyes just as bright.) I said, \"But THUS SAITH THE LORD, you're not going to lose that eye.\" I was hunting with him this last fall, he can see better than me and anybody in the crowd. He never...\n\nL-110 And I seen an elderly lady pull down her stocking and raise up the side of her skirt. She said, \"Son, if you see Brother Branham, tell him to pray for my feet.\" And I looked down there, and little... look like tumors hanging on her feet, all around.\n\nL-111 I said, \"Your mother is a gray-headed lady. 'My son,' you see. She told you before you left, if you seen me, to have me to pray for her feet. She's got little tumors, like, hanging all over her feet.\" He liked to a fainted. Said, \"That's the truth.\" I said, \"Tell her not to worry. It'll be all right.\"\n\nL-112 I started to walk around. Then I heard the Voice of God speak, said, \"Get out of the way, quickly.\" Roy Roberson standing there, knowing he was a veteran of the war, I put my hand on his shoulder, I said, \"Brother Roy, hide, as quick as you can!\" Said, \"What's the matter?\" I said, \"Get out of the way! Hide!\"\n\nL-113 And just started walking around, put my shovel down, turned around, took off my hat. And here He come, the Glory of God falling in a whirlwind that tore the side of the mountain out like that, and blasted and shook the place like 65-0718E, Spiritual Food In Due Season, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 89 min that, cut the top of the bushes out; just about three or four, five feet above my head. Went back up like a funnel like that; it blasted again. And, here it come, three times. [Job 38:1], [Job 40:6], [Nahum 1:3]\n\nL-114 Then when It left, the third time, Brother Banks come over, said, \"That's what you was talking about?\" I said, \"Yes.\" Said, \"What was it?\" I said, \"God appears in whirlwinds.\" I didn't know whether He wanted me to tell the people or not. [Job 38:1], [Job 40:6], [Nahum 1:3]\n\nL-115 Then I went on and prayed a little bit. Then He told me I could tell them. I said, \"It's judgment striking the West Coast.\" Look at her today! Look what happened a few hours after that: Alaska sunk. And now the whole thing is going under. We're entering into the judgment. Mercy has been spurned.\n\nL-116 But thanks be to God, we got hidden Food, spiritual Food, that we're living on the goodness and mercy of the revelation of Jesus Christ in these last days, vindicating Himself among His people. Amen! They went in. Elijah went in before the drought set in. Thank God for being in before the judgment sets in. Now is a time of coming out and going in, getting out of those organizations and getting into Christ, a coming-out and going-in time for all true believers.\n\nL-117 Then he was called, and stayed in there. Remember, he never left that brook until God called him. [I Kings 17:2-5]\n\nL-118 And after the drought was about over, He called him out of there, down to a widow's house. Notice, He called to this widow. And this widow had not associated herself with the unbelievers; took the mark of the beast during the drought. So He called her out to... called Elijah to sustain this widow. They just had one little cake, one little thing she was holding onto. And Elijah said, \"Give that to me, first. For, THUS SAITH THE LORD, that barrel will not go empty neither will the cruse run dry, until the day that the Lord God sends rain upon the earth.\" Putting God first, His Word first! [I Kings 17:8-16]\n\nL-119 Notice, there was meal in the barrel. Every time she went after meal, there was meal in the barrel. There was oil in the cruse, every time she went for it. Why? Meal represented Christ in the meal-offering. The burrs had to be set just right, to grind every one of them. Every burr of this meal exactly the same, showing that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. That was the Word, the Bread of Life following the message, to vindicate the Word. [I Kings 17:8-16]\n\nL-120 So is it today, friends. So is it today, that the Bread of Life that the children eat on, follows the Message of God, to sustain them during the time of the drought. What if He stood in our presence today? What if He stood in our presence right now? He would act and do just exactly like He done the days when He was in flesh here on the earth. The Bride is part of the Husband, the Church is the same as Christ. \"The works that I do shall you do also.\" And it is the Word that done it. He told us that the things that He did that we would do also. [I Kings 17:8-16], [John 14:12]\n\nL-121 We notice here again, if the Word is in us and has come to us, as It did Elijah in that day, It'll do the same thing that he did, he would feed on the secret Things of God which is hid from the world. Oh! Again, it makes the Message and the messenger as one. The spiritual Food is ready, and It's in the season now. And each one of you can have this Food if you wish It, if you are willing to steal away from all of the unbelief of this hour, if you are ready to come into Christ, come into His promise. [I Kings 17:2-18] And remember His promises, in Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, also in Saint John 14:12, and how many more Scriptures, of telling, Joel 2:38, and all that He would do, or 2:28, rather, what He would do in these last days. And how the prophet said that it'd be Light in these last days, how It would work, what It would do, all the Scriptures pointing to this last days. And that is Christ! If you can hide away in That now, in that secret Place, you can eat and see the goodness and mercy of God. If you're sick, there is healing there. [Malachi 4:5-6], [Luke 17:30], [John 14:12], [Joel 2:28]\n\nL-122 You remember when Elisha, later on, had called down... After that meal-offering that he had, Christ, and sustained the widow's house with It. Notice later on when he called fire down out of the heavens, and so forth, and proved his sending, of God, the prophet's Spirit. [I Kings 17:8-16], [I Kings 18:35-39]\n\nL-123 Notice in the wilderness, when he was laying down there under the juniper tree, a Angel come down with that 65-0718E, Spiritual Food In Due Season, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 89 min same kind of meal, and baked some cakes and fed him. And a little later on He put him to sleep again, and woke him up, and he had some more meal cakes baked there for him. And he went in the strength of those cakes for forty days. Glory to God! He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Oh, how we love Him, spiritual Food in Its season! [I Kings 19:5]\n\nL-124 \"It's not meet to take the children's bread and give it to dogs.\" Didn't Jesus say the same thing to the Syrophenician women? He was sent to His Own. That is right. And that's who He come... He never went to the Gentiles. [Matthew 15:25-27]\n\nL-125 And now today He visits the Gentiles in their time, and it's not meet...\n\nL-126 You say, \"Why is it that the Message don't go out in these great big places, these big crusades, like amongst the denominations?\"\n\nL-127 It's not their Food. It's not the church, so calls, Food. It's the Bride Food. It's spiritual Food in season. It would make them sick at their stomach. It's too rich for them. See? See? You--you--you can't do it. But, for the children, It's Bread, It's Life, It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.\n\nL-128 We're going to get too late if we don't start the prayer line now, so let us bow our heads just a moment.\n\nL-129 Dear God, Food in due season, spiritual Food. Something that the world knows nothing of. How we hear our Lord say that night, or that day down there at Samaria, the same place that Elisha walked up and said, \"Why, the dew will not fall till I call for it.\" Here stood Jesus there telling His disciples. [I Kings 17:1] Said, \"Master, why don't You eat?\" He said, \"I have Food that you know not of.\" [John 4:30-34]\n\nL-130 Truly, Lord, His Food was to do the will of God, to see the works of God made manifest in His hour. He was there to see that it was done. \"I do nothing except My Father shows Me first. What the Father shows Me, that I do.\" [John 4:34], [John 5:17, 19-20]\n\nL-131 And, Father, so is it today. The Church, the true believer, the Body of believers, has access to Food, spiritual Food, that the nominals know nothing about. The world knows nothing of this Food, Father. But Your Church, Your people, the Bride of Your Son, loves It.\n\nL-132 We have access to healing of our bodies when the doctors has failed. We have access to this. It's one of the Foods of God, that He gave to His Church, and promised it in the last day to His believing children. And, Father, help us to be believing children, for all things are possible to the believers. Grant it, Dear God. We ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-133 I believe Billy told me that they give out some prayer cards. If somebody would tell me the letter that's on the prayer card, that's all I want. [Someone says, \"C.\"--Ed.] C, all right, let's take C, one, start off, till I get our line started. See, now, they may be all over. Now, if everyone... Well, see, I'm going to try this. I don't know whether we can do it or not. Or either we can just have a calling line; you sit still. It doesn't matter to me. If you'd rather come up here on the platform, or have a calling line, it doesn't matter, just either way. I'm just depending solely on the Holy Ghost. I'm depending Him to defend this Word that I have preached.\n\nL-134 Brother George Wright, I believe It. Since a little boy, coming down to your house many years ago, listen at that old whippoorwill set in the tree, I still believe that same Message. I believe It's the same.\n\nL-135 All right, I see they're clearing back here for a prayer line. All right, prayer card C, number one, two, three, four, five, come first and stand right here. If you can't get up, if you'll just raise your hands, some of them will come pack you. [Someone speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] What is it? Yeah. Uh-huh. Prayer card C, one, two, three, four, five. And now notice, you that do not have a prayer card...\n\nL-136 Now, I haven't had a prayer line of this type for a long, long time. How many remembers my commission when we built the Tabernacle here? Said, \"Do the work of an evangelist.\" Didn't say I was an evangelist. Said, \"Do the work of an evangelist,\" see, \"for the hour will come when that's to be changed.\" That hour is arriving. All right. Now, in this, He... [II Timothy 4:5] 65-0718E, Spiritual Food In Due Season, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 89 min\n\nL-137 You can't mix two or three different ministries together, pastor and evangelize, the same time. You can't be a--a prophet and maybe a pastor, at the same time, see, 'cause you have different works, different ministry.\n\nL-138 But the Lord gave me what I should do in my Message. But then He said, \"Do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry, for the hour will arrive when they will not endure sound Doctrine.\" If that hasn't come now! Every church denomination has turned me down. They wouldn't endure sound Doctrine. \"But after their own lusts they'll bring their own teachers in, and they'll be turned into fables. And they will do great things of exploit like Jambres and Jannes that withstood Moses, but their folly will be made manifest.\" See? See? All right, impersonations! You see how Jambres... [II Timothy 4:3-5]\n\nL-139 And, God in Heaven knows, that lays right there in the corner of that Tabernacle stone since 1933, wrote on a page of a Bible, laying right there. Look how they've done it. Look what's come to pass. Impersonations, just exact. Said, \"Let them alone, their folly will be made known in the same manner as Jambres and Jannes was.\" Here we are in that day.\n\nL-140 I seen the church then when we was just laying the cornerstone, people hanging in the sills and all around, standing around the walls of the Tabernacle. There you are. And they said, when it come up, the people of the city here, said, \"Within the space of six months...\" Us with one dollar and eighty cents to build a Tabernacle, a lot of the garage people done decided it was going to be their garage. But it's still a sheep pen for God's Sheep.\n\nL-141 One, two, three, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. C, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. All right.\n\nL-142 Now, \"I the Lord have planted it, I will water it day and night lest some should pluck it from My hand.\" Look at the criticism! No denomination to back It up. No churches like It around the country here. No Pentecost in the country, nothing else to sustain It. Everybody against the water baptism, everybody against all these other things. Even to my own family, my own daddy turned me away from the door, I got my clothes in a little paper sack and went and lived in New Albany. Right. But through many dangers, toils and snares, I have already come; It's grace that brought me safe this far, I'm fifty-six years old, and soon I've got to cross the river. Grace will take me on. When I've been there ten thousand years, Bright shining as the sun; We'll have no less days to sing God's praise Than when we first begun. Oh, how I love Jesus! He's all the world to me!

Let's bow our heads. Lord, we are happy this morning to be back in the house of God, in another service. And we pray, God, that You will correct us this morning of all of our errors. Show us the paths that You have ordained that we should walk. And give us of Thy grace and love, that we might follow those paths and instructions with all of our hearts, that we might be found, that day, in Christ, blameless, for we believe, Lord, that His appearing is soon.\n\nL-2 We see all the signs that He said would take place just ere His Coming, now being fulfilled. And with joy we look for that moment. As Abraham of old looked for the promised son, and seeing those last signs of God come down on the earth, then he knew that it wouldn't be long until the son would arrive. And now we see it repeat again. Jesus told us that, \"When these things begin to come to pass,\" to lift up our heads, that our--our redemption was drawing nigh, \"perplexity of the time, distress between nations, earthquakes in divers places, the sea roaring, man's heart failing for fear.\" [Luke 21:25]\n\nL-3 We realize that we're in that hour, when the nations don't know what to do. Another war coming up, looks like. What a horrible thing that would be! The earth pulling apart, scientists saying that something terrible is near. We see the Bible speaking of this. Then, Lord, help us today to stand in this house of correction, and take orders from our God, to go forward in this hour of darkness, to shine Light, for it may be our last opportunity to do so. For we ask this in Jesus' Name and for His sake. Amen. Be seated.\n\nL-4 I certainly deem this a grand privilege, to be here in the tabernacle this morning. And sorry that we don't have seating room, around, for you. And the place is packed out, and standing everywhere outside. You people outside now, you can hear this on your radio. I forget... [Someone says, \"Fifty-five to fifty-seven.\" --Ed.] Fifty-five to fifty-seven. You people outside, and out in the parking lots, and on the streets, can hear this on your radio, between fifty-five and fifty-seven on your radio dial. So we tried...\n\nL-5 I was coming back, rather, to here, to try to have about a ten-day meeting, to speak on the subject of The Seven Last Vials. For, in between those Vials is the Trumpets. And I was telling you in the... when I was going to preach on the Seven Trumpets, that I would bring them in with the Vials and the Plagues. And I thought it'd be a good time. I just returned from Africa, and--and the children hadn't had their vacation. My little boy, Joseph, had--had kind of went a little... need a little few weeks of study on his reading. He passed, all right, but he wasn't up to par. So we kept him in Tucson, so, while I was in Africa, and went on his reading and catch up on it, with some day school. And then we come back. And I thought, while the kiddies was having their vacation, I'd have a little meeting here with the people, and preach these subjects. But when we got here, we found that we could not get the school auditorium.\n\nL-6 And I knew the tabernacle wasn't sufficient to seat the people, and make them comfortable the way they should be when they... when I have this Message, therefore we had to--to make a different arrangement. And instead of having the--the ten nights that we were planning on having, well, I made it just two services a Sunday; this Sunday, next Sunday, and the following Sunday, two services. So, and we never advertised it. And, then, if anyone who heard some way that the meetings was going to begin on the twenty-eighth, at the school auditorium, if God permitted, well, if you have any friends and got any reservations in the motels, I--I'd--would cancel it, see, because that--that they, we can't get the convenience to have it. They can't get the--the school auditoriums.\n\nL-7 And now I want to speak, on just evangelistic services on Sunday morning. And Sunday night I want to have prayer 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min for the sick. And we are trusting that God will meet with you people who are sick. I don't know how Billy is going to take care of you; I suppose, give out prayer cards, or however, ways to control the congregation. But we will do all we can to pray for every person in these next three weeks that we intend to have services, if it be the will of the Lord.\n\nL-8 And then many times there is personal interviews, somebody just wants to see you a minute on something or something like that. And we're going to... How many here wants a personal interview, let's see your hand. Wow! Who doesn't? So then we are...\n\nL-9 It's kind of going to be hard to get them, so write out your request and send them, put them in with Billy, then I can get them from there. And, now, he'll announce about, I guess, prayer cards, whenever they're to be given out.\n\nL-10 How many of our ministering brethren is there here this morning? We haven't had a chance to, I don't guess... Have you recognized any of them? How many ministers are here this morning, would you just raise your hands? Or, stand up. Let's see how many ministers are in the congregation this morning. Well, fine! Thank the Lord for these man. Wish we had time to recognize every one of them, but I'm sure you see them. And we... God knows them in their service, and we pray that God will bless them richly. And, no doubts, many of them has closed their services, to be here. Brother Junior Jackson and, I guess, Brother Don Ruddell, and there this broadcast is coming into their churches. And then, also, up in New York and other places across the nation, this is by a private telephone into each church this morning.\n\nL-11 I'm glad to see Brother Richard Blair setting here. I just read a letter of a great thing that God did among the people there. The other day, as I understand... I may be wrong, Brother Blair; if I am, correct me. He was working, helping a man wire a trailer or something, I believe it was. I read the letter. And they reversed something, and, however, it run the current into a water where a little boy was, one... the--the man that the trailer belonged to, his little boy, just a little lad, and it killed the little boy. And his stomach swollen. We know electrical shock, that's, when they die, that's what happens. The little eyes set; his teeth went together.\n\nL-12 It alarmed the brethren so bad. Brother Blair said he thought he could get a hold of me somewhere, to pray for it, but remembered that it was that, \"Wherever two or three are gathered in My Name, there I am in their midst.\" And the father skinned his fingers trying to get his fingers in the little boy's mouth, to break it open. And they knelt down and started praying over the little boy, and he come back to life again. [Matthew 18:20]\n\nL-13 Was that true, Brother Blair? One of our loyal brothers here. Oh, the little boy is here. Well, thank the Lord. That's fine. We'd like for you to stand up, sonny boy. Now, we thank the dear Lord for this. That the father of the little boy? Are you the father? That's right. And here is Brother Richard Blair. Our God is able to do anything. Yes, sir. He promised it. We are living in the Divine Presence of the great, glorious, Heavenly Father. And all things that we... are possible if we can just believe it. [Matthew 18:20]\n\nL-14 You see what that does, what it paid off for that man's life to believe that? Saved his little boy. Now, God had his loyal servants there, to... Brother Blair and them, to pray for the little boy when he was in that condition. Yes, when anything happens, remember, you are children of the living God. \"Wherever two or more are gathered in My Name, there I am.\" And again it's written, \"He's a very present help in time of trouble.\" And if there ever was trouble, was that little boy laying there, dead, on the ground, from a shock of electricity that went through him. So we're thanking God this morning, with all of our hearts, for these, for these things that He has done for us. [Psalms 46:1]\n\nL-15 God bless these faithful man, too. In a time of emergency that's the time to look to God. And look to Him, and be on friendship with Him before the emergency arrives. We know this. If we have favor with God, we can ask Him anything, like you would any other friend, and He is a very present help in time of trouble. [Psalms 46:1]\n\nL-16 I just met on the street, yesterday, Brother John Martin's sister. I was... Someone had stopped me down on the street, and someone went by and waved their hand. Coming back home, you know, you see the people everywhere, stopping and shaking hands, and so forth. And this lady, I remember they called me recently, where someone hit her in the back, in a car, bursted her spine and all up-and-down. She was to be paralyzed the rest of her life. She is setting in 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min the meeting this morning, enjoying the Presence of God. I was just talking with her in the room. I want to pray with her, again. And she was... She is here somewhere. I guess she couldn't get back in. But, here, sure, she is setting right here by us. That's right. Would you stand up just a minute, sister, that people might... Here's a lady the doctor said, a few days ago, would never walk, a busted spine and everything, from a wreck--wreck. And there she stands, whole. You know, the Bible said, \"And they could say nothing against it, 'cause the man was standing in the midst of them.\" That's right. Here's a little boy brought back from the dead, and here's the woman with the bursted spine, standing in the midst of us. It's just been done, so He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Blessed be the Name of the Lord! How happy we should be to be living now in His Presence, and know that He's this very present help in time of trouble. [Hebrews 13:8] Glad to see Brother Vayle, Brother Martin, so many in this morning. The Lord bless you brethren, richly. Now it's...\n\nL-17 I know it's not too cool in here, with all this crowd, but yet, when I left Tucson the other day, it was about a hundred and four or five. And almost midnight, it was ninety-three, and so this feels pretty good to me. And at Parker they said it was a hundred and forty, Friday before we left. And you can imagine how hot that is. Course, that's in the desert.\n\nL-18 And, now, these next three Sundays. Today, the fifteenth, I believe, is that right, or sixteenth; fifteenth, isn't it? Eighteenth, and the twenty-eighth, and the August the first, (is that right?) August. The twenty-fifth... The eighteenth, twenty-fifth, and first, there'll be services at tabernacle. Don't, you know, get too much of it out, 'cause, you see, we can't get what's in, what's here now, inside, you know, and it just gets worse. Just come back if you can.\n\nL-19 And then I'm here to get the trustees together. I'm kind of getting put out of all this turning me down on place to hold a meeting, when I'm feeling led to do it. So I think I'm going to ask if we just can't get our tent and--and put it up, and just stay there, you know. Get out here in the ball park, or out on a farm, and move it from place to place, just as the Lord will lead. And I feel that that's what He's going to do. You know, there's a vision concerning that. And I think that maybe the reason this happens... Now, you know, a lot of times we think it's horrible because certain things happen, but, you know, that might be God, see, driving you into these things. When, He said it, He'll do it.\n\nL-20 A few nights ago, many of you, just in about a month before going over to Africa, many of you perhaps has the tape, of you people that get the tapes, on, Choosing A Bride, was preached in California. The last few minutes of that tape, I don't remember of ever being there. But the Spirit of the Lord came in such a way. I had been condemning them the way they were living and doing, and after the Gospel had been preached and declared before them so much. And all of a sudden the Holy Spirit spoke out and said, \"Capernaum,\" see, \"the city that calls yourself by the name of the angels,\" that's Los Angeles, \"thou are exalted into Heaven, but be brought down to hell.\" See? And then after it was over, why, I was outside, and Brother Mosley and Billy was with me. And they said... Went back and looked, and the whole floor was just laying full of people, ministers sobbing. [Luke 10:15]\n\nL-21 And I went and got the Scripture. I said, \"There is something about that in the Bible.\" And it was Jesus rebuking Capernaum, all those coastal cities that He had visit. Why, He said, \"Capernaum, thou art exalted into Heaven, will be brought down into hell.\" He said, \"For if the works had been done in Sodom and Gomorrah that's been done in you, it'd been standing today.\" And at that time, Sodom and Gomorrah was in the bottom of the sea. And just after that, maybe a hundred years or something, after Jesus' prophecy, Capernaum, the only coastal city that He had visit, a earthquake sunk it in the sea. And you know that was a direct answer to California, to Los Angeles. [Luke 10:12-15], [Matthew 11:23-24]\n\nL-22 And then in Tucson the other day, just as I got back, a great earthquake had happened out there. And the scientists was on the television drawing it out. It was in the papers. That, the earth, the other day, split from the Aleutian Islands, or from Alaska, around the Aleutian Islands, about two hundred miles out into the sea, come back in at San Diego, went around Los Angeles, and come out at San Diego. And it's pulled loose several inches. Houses has toppled down. Motels has went in. 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min And the scientists on this panel was--was asked. Said, \"Well, that could fall in someday?\"\n\nL-23 Said, \"Could? It will!\" And he used the scientific names of how the lava has... That's what's caused these earthquakes all along, around San Diego and down in there. It's been that hollow place. And now all of it's begin to break in, like sand falling in, and now it's just a crust. And it's pulled loose, several inches. They could take radar and stuff, and follow that crack, and mark it. I see where it was at. And it pulled loose, several inches more, maybe two or three inches the other day, again, right after that prophecy was given. And the ones that was interviewing the scientists, said, \"Well, it probably won't be in our age.\"\n\nL-24 He said, \"It could be in five minutes or in five years; but it's going to fall in.\"\n\nL-25 Mrs. Simpson, I don't think she is with us today. Or, I see Brother Fred setting here, but I don't know where Mrs. Simpson is. She went and got a prophecy that I made, about 1935 or something like that, and said, \"The time would come,\" it's written in a book somewhere, \"that the sea would weep its way into the desert.\" Look what'll take place. If that thousands of square miles falls down into the lava of the earth, and slides in, there will be millions die at one time. And that'll cause such a tidal wave! Remember, plumb up into the Salton Sea, is a hundred or two hundred feet lower than the sea level. That water will probably come almost to Tucson, with that tidal wave coming across there. \"And the sea shall weep its way into the desert.\" Nations are breaking, Israel is awakening, The signs that our prophets foretold; The Gentile days are numbered, with harrows encumbered; Return, O dispersed, to your own.\n\nL-26 We're in the end time. Now, the Lord bless you richly. I get started on that and forget about time. We're going to fade quick, pretty quickly, into Eternity, anyhow.\n\nL-27 And now in Saint Mark, the 7th chapter and the 7th verse, to bring a text to this subject that was just read in First Chronicles 13. To make a text for this, I want Mark 7:7. ... in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrine the commandments of men. [Mark 7:7]\n\nL-28 Now, I know nothing but the Message the Lord has given me, and that's all I can speak on. And now, I'm going to speak on a subject this morning which I thought would be good. And tonight I want to speak on, \"meat in due season,\" if the Lord willing: Spiritual Food In Due Season, and how to receive It. Now, this morning: Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God. [Psalms 145:15], [Matthew 24:45], [Luke 12:42]\n\nL-29 God is sovereign. And we see here what David done, in the Scripture reading of First Chronicles 13. And he was... His intentions were good. But God does not give us merits on good intentions. There is only one way to serve God, that's by doing His will at His command. And God, being sovereign, there is no one to tell Him what to do or how to do it. He does it the way, He knows the right way to do it. And that makes me feel good. And it ought to make all of us feel good, and I'm sure it does. For, one would have It coming this way, and one have It going that way, and one the other way. [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-30 But one great thing, again, about God, He has not left us, now, without knowing what's the Truth and how to do it. He wouldn't be just, to punish us for doing something that we didn't know how it was going to be done, and then let us stumble into something. He is not that kind of a God. He's a God that speaks the Word and expects His children to believe It. And, therefore, He knows what's best, and when to do it, and how to do it. We have our ideas of it, but He knows. [John 14:18-21]\n\nL-31 And then if He set up a system, that what He's going to do, and didn't tell us what was going to happen and how it was going to happen, then we, stumbling at it, would be--would be justified in--in our stumblings; or, trying to do something, each one would be justified. But there's only one way, and that is His Word.\n\nL-32 And another thing, David here, we see that in his heart he wanted to do something that was good. He had no bad 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min motive, or no bad objective. But, the house, or the ark of the Lord, was away from the--the people, and he wanted to bring the ark of God back to its place, so the people would consult God about the things that they wanted. [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-33 Instead of--of just letting it go, we... What if Brother Blair and the father of this little boy said, \"Well, it's too bad, child just got hurt, killed. I guess, just something that happened\"? But they went quickly to God.\n\nL-34 What if the little lady, and her husband, a minister of the Gospel, a few nights ago, or days, when that little lady had that bursted spine, that just stood up... The doctor said, \"She'll be paralyzed all of her life.\" What if the husband and she had said, \"Well, honey, we'll just console ourselves to that\"? But quickly they done something about it; they went to God. How many things in the Bible could we refer to, of how when people get in trouble, get to God!\n\nL-35 Well, then, in them days, they had only one meeting place where they could meet God, and that was at the ark, under the blood. That's the only meeting place yet, under the Blood. Mercy seat was sprinkled, to give mercy to the worshiper, or the asker, when he come to ask the petition of God. And God had a special routine, the way you had to go, too, about that, and He wouldn't accept anything else. He wouldn't accept any other provision; just the way He fixed it. [Deuteronomy 16:11]\n\nL-36 Recently I just preached on a Message, many of you know about It, that, only one provided place that God meets the worshiper, the place that He said, \"I'll put My Name.\" If we can find the church that He put His Name in, then we got the place. He said, \"I will not bless you in all the gates; just the gates that I put My Name in. I'll put it in one place, and you've got to meet Me there; and that's the only place I'll meet you.\" And we found out, through there, where He put His Name, and that's the only place that He meets the worshiper. And His Name was Jesus Christ. God's Name is Jesus Christ. [I Kings 9:3], [John 5:43], [Exodus 25:22], [Exodus 29:42-43], [Luke 8:10-11]\n\nL-37 Jesus said, \"I come in My Father's Name.\" Every son comes in his father's name. And He came in the Name of the Father. \"And there is not another Name under Heaven given among men,\" whether it's called Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, church of Christ, whatever it might be done. There's only one meeting place that God meets man, and that's when he's in Jesus Christ, only place. And all these old things back here under the Old Testament, typed that. I want you to clearly understand it. Now, it's a Sunday school lesson. I've got some Scriptures and notes written down here. I thought that this would help you to understand, as all the old things happen for examples to us. [John 5:43]\n\nL-38 Now, we find that God had a way of doing things. But David, just being blessed of God, like he had, and become king, he just thought that he would just do something for God, anyhow. And he never went about it in the right way.\n\nL-39 We notice, God reveals His Word in His Own predestinated season. Now, how could Martin Luther a knowed about the Message today? How could the Presbyterians? How could Martin... or the Catholic church know Martin Luther's message? How could John Wesley a knowed Luther's message? How could Wesley a knowed the Pentecostal message? Or how could the Pentecostals know this Message? See? He reveals It in His seasons, because It is a Seed. And as It grows and matures, He reveals Himself. [Luke 8:11]\n\nL-40 Like the heat of the sun, to open up. When it's tender and young, bring it out of the ground, the seed; then give it its leaves, in another stage of the sun. Hot sun will kill it if it's the ripening seed... or ripening time. So, He regulates the sun and regulates nature, to meet His Word. He regulates the Church, the predestinated, the Bride, to meet the season that they are living in.\n\nL-41 Even nature itself tells us today, as we see the nations breaking, the earth sinking in, the handwriting is on the wall. We see the church and the states it's in. We see the Bride and the state She is in. And we know, by nature, that the Church is getting ready to leave. What a glorious time! It's a time that all the prophets longed to see, this hour.\n\nL-42 Now, He reveals His Word only in Its season. Martin Luther read the same Bible we did. Wesley read the same Bible Martin Luther did. Pentecostals read the same Bible we read. Jesus read the same Bible that the Pharisees read, but they had... Trying to keep the corn in a early stage, when it was ripening, they fail to see their hour. [Amos 3:7] 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min Now David has done the same thing here.\n\nL-43 God reveals this Word in the season, and to whom He chooses to reveal It to. God chooses who He reveals It to. He chose that before the foundation of the world. All of His doings were foreknown by Him, hidden from man. He just reveals them as He will. It is His chosen season, His chosen person. And He never did choose a party or sect; it's a chosen person, how He does it.\n\nL-44 Who is it that will dare to correct Him, and say, \"Now, Lord, You made a mistake by putting this man in the ministry. This man doesn't believe like we believe\"? Who is going to tell God He is wrong in it? It would take somebody that's a little more of a delinquent than I am, to tell Him that. He knows what He is doing. He knows who to choose and who not to choose, what to do and when to do it. No matter how much we think that a certain person is qualified to do a certain job, God knows who is qualified for the time and the season, or the time and the right time to do it.\n\nL-45 And the real, true Christian; the real, true believer in God, waits upon the Lord for these things. Wait on your ministry. If you feel a call, be sure that it's God. Be sure that it's right. Be sure that it's timely of what you're saying. The Bible said, \"They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with the wings like an eagle. They shall run and not be weary. If they walk, they'll not faint.\" [Isaiah 40:31]\n\nL-46 Notice David, king of Israel, just anointed. Samuel poured the oil upon him, and he was chosen of God, to be king of Israel. And David got this revelation, to bring the ark of the Lord up to the city of David. Now, there is nothing wrong, but, you see, David went at it wrong. [I Chronicles 13:3]\n\nL-47 Now, it looks like if a man like that would get a revelation, a great man like God's chosen king, the greatest king that ever lived on earth, outside of Christ, I guess, was David, 'cause Christ is a Son of David. Now, the greatest man, freshly anointed, coming from the very Presence of God, got a revelation to do something for God, and wanted to do it for God; but the revelation was wrong. Now, that's a great thing. It'll deal with our subject: Trying To Do God A Service Without Being Called To Do It. [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-48 Notice, David got the revelation. And notice, it was not the prophet, Nathan-ael, that got the revelation. It was David, the king, that got the revelation. Neither was Nathan-ael consulted about it. He never asked Nathan-ael. But did you see here, in First Chronicles, he consulted captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds? He never consulted Nathan-ael. He consulted the people, and he consulted also the priests and the theologians of that day, the scribes and the theologians. David consulted first, said, \"If it, this, be of God, let us go down and bring the ark of the covenant of our God, up into the city, and let us consult God before we do things.\" [I Chronicles 13:1]\n\nL-49 But said, in the days of Saul, \"They left off consulting God, by the--the--the ark, the Urim, Urim Thummin. They left off doing that.\" David said, \"Now let's get back to God, all of us! Let's get back to the right thing. Let's go down and get the ark and bring it here, bring the Presence of God,\" in other words, \"into the city. Let's hold a revival. Let's bring the people back.\" But he got the revelation, which seemed to be good, but it wasn't the will of God. [I Chronicles 13:3]\n\nL-50 Instead of asking the source that he should have asked, he consulted his captains, because he had just become king. And he followed that line of thinking, that, his chief captains and his great man.\n\nL-51 Then he went into the church nominal and asked if they could have the revival. The priests, the scribes, the captains of thousands, the captains of hundreds, and he consulted them. \"Was this the will of the Lord?\" And they said it was. But, you see, he failed to ask the main resource that God always deals through. See, he failed to get it.\n\nL-52 Now his intention was good. His motive was good. His objective was good, and to bring a revival in the city, bring the people back to God. But he never consulted the way God told him to do it. See?\n\nL-53 Even all the people agreed, and the priests, and that the king was right, \"They needed the ark back in the city. Now, they needed the Presence of God. They needed a revival.\" But God had not promised to reveal His Word, in Its season, to the peoples. He never promised to reveal It to the king, in the season. God doesn't change, a bit. He didn't promise to do that. [I Chronicles 13:1-5] 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min\n\nL-54 No matter how sincere, and what good motives, and what good objectives, and how people want those things and see the need of it, there is a will of God to be carried out in these things. That's what I want to drive down tight, for I want to make this so that you have to see it if--if the Spirit of God dwells in you. And that's the reason I'm lingering so long here. Not taking you people's time on the telephone, and on the hookup, but I--I want you to see it. If you run out of time, then get the tape. That there...\n\nL-55 No matter how much it's needed, how much everybody agrees that it's needed, how much that that is the Truth, there is yet one thing to find out. Is that the will of God? Now, God never promised that He would reveal His secrets to His kings, He would reveal His secrets to His people. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-56 Something like the time of Micaiah, the son of Imlah. As we leave, not the text, but another time, to bring this in and make it true to you, real to you, so you won't miss it.\n\nL-57 There was, in the days of Micaiah... He was a poor man, and he also come from a poor family. But, Ahab, king of Israel, as a nation being under God, he had set aside a school and had brought up selected, hand-picked prophets, and had four hundred of them in a school. And they were great man. They wasn't just false prophets. They were Hebrew prophets, genuine man. And they consulted the Lord by these man. And they did prophesy. But, you see, when the real showdown came, they were every one out of God's Word and will. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] [I Kings 22:6]\n\nL-58 For Jehoshaphat came down from Jerusalem to meet the--the king Ahab, and they put on their garments, and set out in the--in the gateways, and brought the prophets up before them. First, Ahab said, \"We got a place up here at Ramoth-Gilead that actually belongs to us.\" Now, that's THUS SAITH THE LORD. Joshua divided it for the people and give that to them, but the Philistines had taken it over. And said, \"Here our children need bread, and we ain't got enough land to raise the bread on. And our enemy, the Philistines, feed their children, the heathens, off of the very ground that Jehovah God gave us.\" That's very straight. And said, \"Here, we, the people of God, set here with our children, needy, and our enemy feeds their children on the ground that God called us out of Egypt and give it to us.\" That would raise a theologian, wouldn't it? He said, \"Shall we go up and take our grounds that God gave to us?\" [I Kings 22:3]\n\nL-59 Jehoshaphat said, \"Yes, I'll help you. We are brothers. You're in Judah, and I'm in--I'm in Jerusalem.\" Or--or, was it visa versa? I believe... No, that's right. I think it... Jehoshaphat. However, Jehoshaphat was a good man, a king, a righteous man who loved the Lord. Ahab was a lukewarm believer. So they brought them down, and Jehoshaphat said, \"Listen, let us consult the Lord, first. We ought to find out about this.\" See, if David would have done what Jehoshaphat did! He said, \"Shouldn't we do this?\" And quickly, being an Israelite, Ahab said, \"Certainly. I've got four hundred Hebrews, like we are, Hebrew prophets of our own organization. And I'll consult them. They are prophets.\" Now, you see, just... [I Kings 22:5-7]\n\nL-60 You say, \"That stumbles me, Brother Branham. A prophet?\" Oh, yeah. There was one in the time of Jeremiah, who said they would only be down there two years. The Lord told Jeremiah, \"seventy.\" Put a yoke around his neck, and the prophet broke it, Hananiah. But you know what happened to him. Oh, yeah. You got to stay with the Word. So these prophets came up and prophesied, and said, \"Go on up! The Lord is with you.\" [Jeremiah 28:10]\n\nL-61 And one of them, I believe (forget his name now) the chief, Zedekiah, I believe, said, he put two iron horns and said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD. By this,\" now that man was sincere, \"you will push your enemy plumb back into their lands, and take what belongs to God. It's give to you.\" I don't believe he was a hypocrite. I believe he was a good man. I believe all them prophets were. [I Kings 22:11]\n\nL-62 You say, \"Prophets?\" Yep! Remember, the very man that consented to kill Jesus Christ, prophesied, because it was his office. He was high priest that year. And being that he had that office, and held that office, the Spirit of God came to him. That didn't mean he was saved or anything about it. And he prophesied, Caiaphas, because it was his office that did it. [John 11:49-50]\n\nL-63 And these prophets, being prophets, of office prophet, prophesied. And the Spirit of God came on them, man with 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min gifts of the Spirit.\n\nL-64 I realize I'm talking to ninety-nine percent Pentecostals. But man many times, a man, God can deal with them, give them a gift, and the people will squeeze in on those people. If they're not perfectly called and sent of God, he'll cause that man or woman to say something that isn't His will, because the people constrains them to do it.\n\nL-65 How I had to catch our own little pastor here on it. Out here in the woods one morning, about three o'clock in the morning, said, \"Go tell Brother Neville!\" I come to you, didn't I, Brother Neville?\n\nL-66 Everybody, \"Brother Neville, prophesy over me. Tell me this or that.\" See, you would have him saying things then that wouldn't come to pass. \"They that wait,\" to find out what the Lord wants to do. [Isaiah 40:31]\n\nL-67 So these man looked upon it in a natural sense, \"It belongs to us.\" But, you see, they didn't find the Word and will of God.\n\nL-68 Then Micaiah come down, and he had a vision. He examined, first, you notice. Said, \"Wait. Give me tonight. Let me find out, and tomorrow maybe I can answer you.\" He wasn't right quick, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD,\" like, in agreeing with the other prophets. He said, \"I'll only speak what God says.\" And the next day, we find out, God told him what would happen. And it was absolutely contrary to the others. The whole school, it was contrary. And even one of them walked up and smacked him in the face, for it. But, see, he waited. Then when he did that, he compared his prophecy, his vision, with the written Word, and it was right with the Word. [I Kings 22:14]\n\nL-69 When somebody says they \"got a revelation to baptize people in the Name of the 'Father, Son, Holy Ghost,'\" that's contrary to the Word. None of the rest of them ever did. When they say, that, \"Oh, we're going to stand, and this, that, and the other,\" and so forth, that's contrary to the Word. When they say they \"don't believe the serpent's seed,\" that's contrary to the Word. All these other things, that's contrary to the Word. It must be with the Word and at the season.\n\nL-70 Now, if David would a only done that. The ark was coming, but not at that time; was no place for it.\n\nL-71 Notice now when they went down to get the ark, all the dignitaries said, \"That's the thing to do, David. Glory to God! We need a revival.\" That was real Pentecost, today; Baptist, Presbyterian. \"David, you're our king! You all... Captain So-and-so, and Major So-and-so, and General So-and-so, will be at your meeting. Why, they say that's just the thing to do, David. You got the whole country with you.\" That's what's the matter today. I don't want the country. I want God, if there is nobody else stand.\n\nL-72 David had all the captains. He had co-operation with the military forces. He had co-operation with all the denominations, with all the theologians, with all, everybody agreeing with him. So did Ahab, and others in the Scripture; but he didn't have God, because he was out of the will of God. I hope we get this. [I Chronicles 13:1]\n\nL-73 Notice, they done every religious thing they could. They probably put out advertisements and everything, \"Great revival! The ark is going to be brought back. We're going to have a revival. We're going to do this.\"\n\nL-74 Notice, he sent singers. He sent people with harps, with trumpets, and they done every religious thing that they knowed how to do; and still God was not in it. Somewhat see it repeating again, don't we?\n\nL-75 They took all the singers. They took the harp players, the trumpet blowers; the women, the man, and whoever it was that sing. They took them all down there, and they went through every religious motion. I don't want to say this, but I got to say it. So is these denominations today, Pentecostal and all, is going through every religious motion, of singing and shouting.\n\nL-76 Notice, David shouted with all of his might, and he screamed, and he jumped, and he went through every religious motion that there could be; and still God was not in it. And his motive, and his objective, and everything was right; but he went the wrong way with it. See? He done all the religious movements; shouted, sang, had special singers, special shouters, everything else. They danced in the spirit. They done everything that was religious. [I Chronicles 13:1-14] 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min\n\nL-77 It's something like our great crusades of our time. They want to win the world to Christ. There is no such a thing. Great landslide revivals, great things happening; if they could only realize, that day has passed. She is doomed. But they are building, crusades, organizations, and everything. But, the results is just about like it was in David's time, it didn't work. [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-78 We go and have a revival. Our great, some of our great evangelists today, they say they have thirty thousand converts, in six week's time; and a year from there, go back, they can't find thirty. There is something wrong. What it is, it's just the same thing David done. Great dignitaries, great man, great preachers, greater schools, great authority, but still they are consulting an old denomination instead of looking in the face of God's Word and see when the season's on. You can't raise certain foods but just certain times of the year.\n\nL-79 Now let us see what happened. Although their... Their religious emotion and stuff was great, their intentions was great, their crusade was great, their singing was great, their dancing was great, their shouting was great, their music was great, and they had the ark. What good is the ark without God? It's just a wooden box, couple tables of stone. That's like taking communion, being baptized. What good does it do to be baptized if you're not first repented? What good does it, take communion, become a hypocrite, if you don't live the life and believe the rest of God's Word? Take part of It, and not the rest of It, it shows there is something wrong. [I Corinthians 11:20-34]\n\nL-80 Now, when all this happens, let us now see what happens when God, and His age and His time, is not considered; just the people's idea.\n\nL-81 Many people has said to me, \"Why don't you come over here and hold a meeting? Well, we call for you. Sign this, that, or the other.\" Wait! You might want it, but what does God say about it? Many people has said to me... I've had invitation, I've had interviews, personal interviews and things, waited for a year. Wait! How will I know what to say until God tells me what to say? See, got to wait! That's the reason I said, \"Write that out. Let me see what He said.\" See? Wait! \"They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.\" That right? [Isaiah 40:31]\n\nL-82 Notice, they consulted only the priests of that day, the theologians, the denominations. And notice, by doing that, consulting the priests and consulting the congregation, consulting the people, they did it wrong. [I Chronicles 13:1-2]\n\nL-83 Notice, the ark was the Word. We know that's right. Cause, the ark is Christ, and Christ is the Word. See? The ark, or the Word, was not put in its first, ordained, original ordained position. Oh, don't fail to get this, church!\n\nL-84 Everything was perfect, and everything looked good, like a great revival was coming; but because they failed to consult the right person about it! They consulted the priests, consulted the dignitaries, consulted the theologians, consulted the singers, and got everything together with one accord, and a great organization of the military, and also the--the--the forces of the nation. Everything was in harmony for a great meeting, but they failed to consult God. So had Ahab, so had others. What a moment! [I Chronicles 13:1-14], [I Chronicles 15:1-3, 11-15]\n\nL-85 Now don't miss this. They failed to get it, because they hadn't consulted. And by doing that... Watch. By going to the priests, by going to the theologians, and by going to the military forces, and not even considering their God-sent messenger of the hour, Nathan, they did it wrong. They went and picked up the ark and put it upon a new cart, put it upon a new cart, or, \"a new denomination is going to start up,\" and not upon the God-given, ordained way to pack it. It was supposed to be packed on the shoulders of the Levites. But, you see, when you start wrong, you'll keep on going wrong. [I Chronicles 13:1-14], [I Chronicles 15:1-3, 11-15]\n\nL-86 If a bullet is supposed to be directed to a target, and you jerk the barrel one thousandths off here, to begin with, at a hundred yards you're four or five inches off. You start wrong.\n\nL-87 O God, help us to know this thing has started wrong, this great crusades of the hour, and they're so called. God is not consulted about it. Priests and religious man is consulted. Organizations is consulted. \"Well, will you have such-and-such? I believe, if we could get everybody together!\" Don't get everybody together. Just get God's Word about it. 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min\n\nL-88 Then we find that, when they do that, what do they do? They continually to go right on with their same old religious program, which is out of the Word of God and the will of God. That thing died, years ago, them old dried up things of years ago.\n\nL-89 It had dried up in the days of Lord Jesus. They didn't know it. Said, \"If you'd a knowed Moses, you'd a knowed Me, for Moses said I was coming.\" Said, \"Our fathers eat manna in the wilderness.\" [John 5:46], [John 6:31]\n\nL-90 Said, \"They're all dead!\" \"Blind,\" He called them, Pharisees, religious leaders. \"Except you believe that I am He, you'll die in your sins.\" But they didn't do it. They was so set in their ways. They had to have it their way. [John 6:49], [John 8:24]\n\nL-91 That's the way David did it. He had it in his way, so he just said, \"You know what I'll do? We're moving.\" He had a revelation. \"We're moving now, so we'll do it a new way. The days of miracles is passed, so we'll just make us another organization. We'll build a new cart, showing a new thing has started.\" What a false prophecy! [I Chronicles 13:7]\n\nL-92 You've got to go back the way God said do it. They put it upon the shoulders of the Levites, and that was over the heart. The ark, the Word, is not to be packed upon a new denomination, upon the theories of some man, but in the heart. The Word of God is not to be handled by denominations; It's to be handled by the heart of a man, where God can come in there and reveal Himself. And if he reveals it according to the Word, it's God; if it isn't, it's not. And, then, the Word of that season! Sure, a Pharisee could say, \"Who told us that we can't do this and do that? Moses give us these orders.\" \"But Moses also said...\" Satan said, \"Why, it is written, 'He'll give His Ang-... '\" [I Chronicles 15:11-15]\n\nL-93 \"And it's also written,\" said Jesus. The season, the time! \"If you'd have knowed Moses! You have one accuse you, Moses. If you'd a knowed Moses, you'd a knowed Me,\" He said, \"for Moses wrote of Me. 'The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet among you, of your brethren; Him shall they hear.'\" If they'd have knowed Moses, they'd have knowed Him. [Deuteronomy 18:15-18], [Ecclesiastes 3:1]\n\nL-94 Now close, listen, don't miss this now. See, first thing, when they consulted the priests, consulted the dignitaries, consulted the military, consulted all the congregation, the neighborhood, to get together for this great meeting to come, they failed to do it right. They didn't consult God. And, by doing so, not going back and see what time it was! [I Chronicles 13:1-2]\n\nL-95 Oh, brother, listen. What time are we living in? What's the age? What's the hour that we're in? It's not time for these things that they're talking about. That's passed. Judgment is on hand now. You can see it breaking. You remember the rock up on the mountain? Judgment hour! You remember the revelation, or the vision of the Bride? Just keep Her in step. Don't let Her get out of step. Notice, \"Upon the shoulders of the priests!\"\n\nL-96 And David and all the priests, that really ought to have knowed better, but what was it? The priests should a knowed better. The scribes, theologians, should a knowed better, because the Word said not to do that.\n\nL-97 And today when they want to say, \"Oh, Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday, today, and forever. That's mental telepathy. That's this, that, or the other.\" They fail to see the promised Word. \"Oh, that was a day gone by.\" David said, \"Oh, well, now wait a minute. 'Upon the shoulders of--of the priests,' that was back when Moses come out. Sure, we, we'll put it on a new cart today. I got a revelation of it.\"\n\nL-98 The priests said, \"Amen, David!\" See, influenced by their new ecumenical council, that they should all be together and do this this way and that way, that's what caused the priests to stumble. They never consulted the right person. They didn't do it right, therefore they got in trouble. Yeah.\n\nL-99 I'm afraid, in a lot of things today... When a great teacher, one of Pentecostal's greatest, stood before the religious 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min group the other night in Chicago. I was supposed to have that meeting with the Business Men; but I thought I'd be in Africa that time, but just got back the day before it started. And they chose a great Pentecostal intellectual, and he got up and told them that this ecumenical move was a thing of God. And said that all of them is coming back, even the Catholic church is going to come back to its original condition, all speaking in tongues for the evidence, and so forth. And not knowing that's a trap of the devil!\n\nL-100 And a man that I didn't know... Sometimes you plant seed; you don't know what's going to happen. But the president of the Full Gospel Business Men, as soon as the great speaker set down, he said, \"I am prone not to say things against our speakers, but that ain't the way Brother Branham said would happen. But he said that would lead to the mark of the beast.\" He said, \"But Brother Branham don't know what he's talking about.\" Said, \"We are... believe he does.\" See?\n\nL-101 And in Chicago, said, \"How many here would like for me to come up and give my version of it?\" Begin screaming and shouting. See, you're planting seeds; you don't know what's going to happen. Just keep laying out the Seed. When that hour comes, some of them is...\n\nL-102 Like Thomas, he was about the last one to see the Lord. But, he had to see Him, to believe Him. See, when they see it happen. Oh, Thomas come in, but he was a little late.\n\nL-103 Now when they see the things that's predicted, and saying THUS SAITH THE LORD, happens, then they say, \"Give us some of your Oil.\" See? [Matthew 25:8]\n\nL-104 But now notice, influence. Sometimes great guys get together. You hear them say, \"Great So-and-so, and great So-and-so, our great...\" Don't never do that. There is no great ones among us. There's only one great One, and that's God. We are brothers, sisters. I don't care if you're pastoring a church that's got five people in it, that don't make you little; that makes you a brother, see, if you're true to God's Word. Don't care what, how; you don't get little. God don't have little children and big children. He just has children. They're all the same. [James 2:1-5], [Proverbs 28:21], [Proverbs 24:23], [Ephesians 6:9], [II Chronicles 19:7], [Colossians 3:25], [I Peter 1:17]\n\nL-105 Notice, God Himself come from the ivory palaces of Glory, to become one of us. Now who is the big one? Took... Not come down here to take the form of a priest, but a servant. Washed the very clay that He created, the feet of His apostles and others. Now who is great?\n\nL-106 But influenced, these man were. They didn't understand. They thought something new was going to happen, no, something that God didn't say was going to happen. They went at it the wrong way. That's what all this enthusiasm, when the... started back yonder, a long time ago, each denomination had to have a Divine healer; each denomination had to have this, that, or the other. Each denomination had to have a little David. Each one had to have this, that, or the other. See what happened? It done the same thing it did here. Same thing. Influence! [I Chronicles 13:1]\n\nL-107 The Word for the season, the time that they were living in, was ignored.\n\nL-108 Notice, \"the Levites' shoulders,\" was the original, provided way of God to do these things. \"Pack that ark on the Levites' shoulders.\" Anything outside of that was contrary. What He said, that's what He meant. God cannot change. That's the reason, stay with His Word! I've got Script, yeah, First Chronicles 15:15, if you want to put that down. Notice. [I Chronicles 15:15]\n\nL-109 Now notice, there, in following God. Now I want you to kind of jot this in your mind. To keep God's commandments, to do anything right for God, to do--do God a service correctly, there is five musts, to do God's service correctly.\n\nL-110 Now David was doing God a service. He was doing everything he knowed to do, except leaving off God. See? He was doing something was right, something good for the people, something good for the church. [I Chronicles 13:1-10] 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min\n\nL-111 But there is five musts. I want you to remember these. No matter how sincere a man may be in doing it, doing God a service, this, these five must be there. First, it must be His time to do it.\n\nL-112 What if--if Moses would come, say, \"We'll build an ark and float up the Nile, like Noah did\"? Noah's time was all right for an ark, but not his time.\n\nL-113 What if Jesus would come, said, \"Now I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll just go up on the mount, like Moses did, and get a new declaration of laws\"? See? Huh-uh! He was that law. See?\n\nL-114 You must be in His time. It must be in His season. You got that now? Must be in His time. It must be in His season, time and season. [Ecclesiastes 3:1-8]\n\nL-115 And it must be according to His Word that has been spoken. It must. I don't care how well you say this ought to be, or that ought to be, or this ought to be. It's got to be according to His Word; according to His time and His season. And it must be given according, to the person He has chosen to do it by. [Matthew 5:18], [Luke 16:17], [Luke 21:33]\n\nL-116 I don't care how much dignitaries. There is king David, just as great as any of them. He was king over the nation. But He had a way of doing it, and He had told them how He would do it. But they failed to do it.\n\nL-117 It must be according to His Word; according to His time, according to His program.\n\nL-118 And it must be by the person He has chose to give it and to do it. Moses tried to run from it, \"Take somebody else.\" But God chose Moses to do it. Many of them; Paul tried to get out of it; many others. But it's got to be by the one He chooses to do it. And it must come, first, to His prophets. The Word of God must come to His prophets. Amos 3:7, \"The Lord God will do nothing until first He reveals It to His servant the prophet.\" Four. [Amos 3:7] And the prophet must be a vindicated by the Word of God.\n\nL-119 There is your five musts. It's got to be that way. His time, His season, when He said it would be; and the man that He chose; and it must come to the prophet; and the prophet must be a vindicated prophet. We find out, many of them in the Bible, it come to the prophets and it wasn't vindicated. Our prophet is Jesus Christ. [Ecclesiastes 3:1]\n\nL-120 So now notice, see, God had not revealed the thing to them by His provided way of doing it. They had accepted David's way. They had accepted the priests' way. They had accepted the scribes' way, the theologians', but not God's way. Nathan-ael, was, he was a prophet of that day. Later on, Nathan-ael told them how to do it. But, see, they done it without consulting Nathan-ael. Not a word says that Nathan-ael was consulted. All the influence, the great thing going on! And, my, I think of that song, \"Let, keep...\" [I Chronicles 13:1-14], [I Chronicles 15:6-25] Help me, Lord, when hearts are aflame, Let me humble my pride (to go with the rest of them), just call on your Name; Teach me not to rely on what others do, Just wait in prayer for an answer from You. See, that's the way it is. Let me see it happen in the right way, then it's believed.\n\nL-121 Now, God revealed the thing to them by David, and by the ministers, and by the people, and by the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, but not by Nathan-ael who had THUS SAITH THE LORD. And the Lord said He would do nothing until He showed that prophet of the age, first, what to do. See what they did? They went straight out of the Word of God, went and put the ark upon a new cart. See? So they went about to do it apart from God's commandment and God's provided way. [Amos 3:7], [I Chronicles 13:1-14], [I Chronicles 15:6-25] And that's what's happened today, friends. That's why we've had so many great crusades, and so forth, and no results. More infidelity, more sin, more... I tell you, this nation is gone; not only this nation, but other nations. This nation, like England of another age, has been the prostitute of all the rest the nations. 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min\n\nL-122 Way down in Mozambique, four hundred and eighty miles from civilization, in the jungle, beatnik kids listen to Elvis Presley, jerking their head and bouncing up-and-down like that, all night long, with stay... Or, little sets like that will pull for a thousand miles, plumb over in Rhodesia, to get Elvis Presley. And yet they say, \"He is very religious, him and Pat Boone, and them.\" Why, it's the Judas of the hour, and don't know it. That's the bad part, they believe they're--they're right. Didn't Jesus say to this Laodicean Church Age, \"Thou art naked, miserable, wretched, blind, and don't know it\"? Don't know it! [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-123 Well, the Pentecostal kids down in Africa and around, say, \"Well, Elvis Presley, he sings the prettiest you ever heard.\" No doubt but what David did, too; no doubt but what the singers did, but it caused death to strike the camp. See where they're, where we're at today, friends? [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-124 \"The Levites' shoulders,\" was God's original way to do it. And they had put it on a new cart. Now, it'll never work. They didn't consult the right way. See? So they got out, about it, and went about it in the wrong way. [I Chronicles 15:14-15], [I Chronicles 13:6-7]\n\nL-125 And that's what's happened today. When man, no matter how sincere, try to do Him a service outside of His provided way of revealing it, they always mess it up. God sets it in His way. Man, no matter how sincere, you try to do it outside of that, you--you'll mess it up. [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-126 Something like Balaam was, in Balaam's day. God told Balaam, that prophet. He was a prophet, the prophet Balaam. He was a prophet, and the Word come to him exactly, said, \"Don't go down there. That's My selected. That's My choice.\" And Balaam got with the dignitaries, the military man, preachers, influenced man, and said, \"Well, I'll--I'll tell you, the king will...\" See, just pattern with David, pattern with today. Just take everything in a type, and you'll see it. You see it? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] See, see, just like it is now. [Numbers 22:1-25]\n\nL-127 But the clergymen said, the--the--the priests said, the scribes said, the theologians said, \"This is the way it's supposed to be done.\" But, it wasn't, and it proved it wasn't. And God told Balaam, and he was a prophet, first, He told him, \"Don't go down.\" [Numbers 22:9-12]\n\nL-128 But the influence of these other man caused him to do it contrary to what God said do it, and it become a curse instead of revival. Oh, sure, he got down there and taught the people, say, \"Now wait! You know what?\" Said, \"We are--we are Moabites. You remember, Lot's daughter is our queen. She is our origination. We're all of one blood. We're all... All of us denominations are the same.\" Don't you mix with that thing. Stay away from there. See? So he said, \"We're all the same. Why, your peoples is like my people. We can intermarry, one among another, so we can have a real ecumenical council. See? All of us can get together and come back to the original thing again.\" [I Chronicles 13:1-14] God cursed the thing. That sin never was forgiven Israel. It stayed with them the rest of their days. It never was forgiven. They perished in the wilderness with it. That's right. Because they didn't take God's provided way by His a vindicated way of doing it. [Numbers 22:12]\n\nL-129 Notice, this thing that they did caused Israel to die the death, in the wilderness. And Jesus said, \"They're every one perished and gone.\" Watch who it was stood with Moses back there, Joshua and Caleb, in the--in the program. [John 6:49]\n\nL-130 Notice again, here is David, what he done. And when he did, what did it do? It caused death to strike a sincere person. Now, I guess we're still hooked up, and I want you to hear across the lands. This thing that David done, without consulting Nathan-ael and getting the Word of the Lord for it, it caused death to strike sincere people. Yes, sir. He put his hand forth, which had been living in the presence of the ark; it come out of his--his house. And the ox stumbled, and the ark was falling. [I Chronicles 13:1-14] 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min\n\nL-131 They had already done one thing wrong, two things wrong. First, they never consulted Nathan-ael. The next thing they did, they went down there by not consulting the Word of God. Which, the... Samuel was the Word in that day... And he never consulted the Word of the Lord. Then, when they did, they went contrary to the Word of God. And here this good man, that had been caretaker, he was a bishop, thought, \"Well, here, I don't want God to be let down,\" so he put his hand on the ark. Where, he wasn't a Levite, and he died. Three things! [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-132 Now think real hard, and watch what the denominations has done today. See, they've turned It down, called It \"false doctrine.\" See? Look where they're at. They'll get their ecumenical council, all right. Called It \"mental telepathy,\" when God Himself vindicating It to be the Truth, and proving It's the Truth. \"Oh, they're just a little bunch of nitwits up there,\" they say, \"don't know what they're talking about.\" That's right, we don't. But we just say His Words, and He knows what He's talking about, see. I can't explain It, nobody else can, but He--He--He proves It.\n\nL-133 Now notice. A many a sincere believer today, that comes to Christ, wants to come with all of his heart, is killed spiritually the same way. Many sincere man go to the Catholic church and wants to become a Christian, go to the Methodist, the Baptist, church of Christ, and even the Pentecostals, see, and wants to become a Christian, put his hand on it, join up with them.\n\nL-134 And when David saw this thing happen, it woke him up. Don't wake up too late out there, brother. He seen that death had hit. Show me the results. What has this so-called revival, getting people back in the churches, done to the nation, to the--to the body of believers? It's nothing but made new organizations and denominations, all the way along, more members and so forth. Is the nation better? They said they was going to... [I Chronicles 13:9-14]\n\nL-135 \"America. God bless America. It's--it's a nation, it's a Christian country.\" It's a million miles from being a Christian country. I don't even pray for it. How can I pray for it, and it won't repent under the mighty powers of God demonstrated before it; and denying, and closing the doors to It, and walking away? I commit it to God. And she is going further away. And now she is going to sink. Just watch what happens.\n\nL-136 Many sincere person go join an organization, or a group, or a cult of some sort, and there they die, spiritually. You can't tell them nothing. They get that stuff drilled into them, \"Why, these bishops said this. And this said this, this said this.\" You show them right here in the Word of God where it's THUS SAITH THE LORD. \"But our pastor...\" I don't care what your pastor says, don't care what I say, or anybody else says. If it's contrary to God's vindicated Word, the hour, the time, the Message, and so forth, forget it. Stay away from it. And I've got to stand before every one of you in the Day of Judgment, and you know that. And little would I say that, knowing I'm an old man now. I'll... It ain't that I know something, but He knows. I just follow what He said. [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-137 Look today at the big crusades that we've had across the land. It's proven that it's been in vain. And didn't Jesus say here now, Luke 7:7, \"In vain do they worship Me\"? In vain did David bring the ark up. In vain did Ahab train them prophets. In vain did Balaam take that money. \"Teaching for Doctrine the commandments of man.\" It's the commandments of God that counts, no matter how sin-... [Luke 7:7], [I Chronicles 13:1-14], [I Kings 22:5-40]\n\nL-138 \"Them people are really sincere.\" You hear that so much, \"They are so sincere.\" That don't mean nothing. Jehovah Witness, Seventh-day Adventist, and all those cults, get out here on the street and do things that one of us wouldn't do. Catholics stand on the corner and beg, and so forth, those orders of it like that, and worth billions times billions times billions of dollars, still beg for it. Sincere, no doubt. Churches go and--and preach, and so forth, and ministers stand in the pulpit and do everything they can to get new members into their church; but it's a new ark. There is only one Ark to follow, that's, the Word of God. Anything contrary to that Ark, stay away from it! It's on a new cart, and not on the shoulders of God. Right. Stay away from the thing. Don't have nothing to do with it.\n\nL-139 Our big crusades, billions and millions has made confessions. And I doubt whether there would be a hundred of them, of all of it. See, hasn't been a thing. Then look at the Word promise. 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min\n\nL-140 You'll think that that's failed, and we know it's failed. Some of our greatest of--of revivalists in the land today say that it's utterly failed. The church knows it's failed. Everybody knows it's failed. Well, why is it? Why did it fail? It was for a good purpose. It was to bring people in the Presence of God, great crusades. And millions of people spent their money, and put in great crusades. And churches all went together, great auditoriums, and great things, and great things taken place. Why did it fail? Is because they never knowed the hour they were living. No wonder Jesus stood, and in His heart He wept. Tears run down His cheeks, and He said, \"Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, how oft would I have hovered you as a hen would her brood. You've stoned every prophet I sent to you. But you would not. But now your hour has come.\" [Luke 13:34]\n\nL-141 Can't you feel the Holy Spirit screaming out from you? \"Oh, United States and the world, how oft I would have gathered you, but you would not. Now your hour has come. Your god of pleasure, your god of filth, your Sodom and Gomorrah god, has come among you.\" Even our little kids, beatle haircuts and bangs across their faces, and little perverts starting out. Our women is gone. It's beyond redemption. Our man has become big sissies, walking around with little, short pants on, and acting like a girl, and hair hanging down their necks. And we are Sodomites, and the fire and the wrath of God waits for us.\n\nL-142 You know how He'll kill, how He'll destroy it? The way He always did. When a prostitute did anything wrong, she was stoned to death; they picked up stones to kill the woman that was a prostitute. That's how He'll kill the church. The Bible said He'll rain hailstones out of the heavens, that'll weigh a hundred pounds apiece, and He'll stone them. Who is going to stop Him? What science is going to say it can't be done? He'll do it. The same as He made a ark and floated Noah to safety, He'll do it again for His Church. And by His Own laws and His Own way, He'll stone that prostitute who has committed adultery with the kings and captains of hundreds and thousands. He'll stone her to death, by His Own laws that He set in order. Who is going to tell Him He can't make a hailstone?\n\nL-143 Ask someone who knows how a raindrop starts. And it makes a circle, and goes back through a turbo; picks up more and more and more, till it gets a certain weight, and then it falls down. He, God, Who... gravitation could not even hold Him on the earth, and He lifted up into Heaven. God, Who made gravitation, can also make a turbo big enough to swing a stone till it'll weigh a hundred pound. He said He would do it, and He'll do it. Who is going to tell Him not to do it? He'll do it, because He said He would.\n\nL-144 We're in the last days. We're standing near the judgment. Why? They're trying to eat old manna that fell back yonder fifty years ago, the Pentecostal church. The Holiness church is trying to, over two hundred years ago. The Lutherans, about three hundred, or more, years ago, many hundreds of years ago. They're trying to eat old manna. Oh, brother, that stuff is stagnated. It's contaminated. It'll... It's got--it's got... Why, I always said, wiggle-tails in it, maggots. It'll kill you, to eat it.\n\nL-145 Find out if David or if any of the rest of them would only consulted the Bread of that hour. If the priests, and prophets, and preachers, and theologians, and schools, and denominations, would've only consulted the hour! But now it won't do them no good. It done moved out. It won't help a bit. She is gone now. She crossed that line about five years ago, between repentance, judgment and mercy. [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-146 Notice, what is then? What can be done? What is to be done? Let's consult the prophet, the Bible, where we cannot add to or take from It. If we do, God takes us from the Book of Life. [Amos 3:7] The Bible said, in Malachi 4, what would happen today. Revelations 10, how the Seven Seals would be opened and reveal all these mysteries that's been hid through these reformers! He said how it would be done. It's in the Bible, THUS SAITH THE LORD. God has completely, perfectly identified that; and vindicate It to be Truth, by signs, wonders in the heavens, in the skies, and everything else, for thirty-three years. [Revelation 10:1-7] You think they'll listen to It? No. They are dead. They've put their hand into something that's killed the whole thing. No, it won't; it won't, never no more. [Revelation 22:17-18], [Malachi 4:1-6], [I Chronicles 13:8-12]\n\nL-147 It was when this thing happened, that David saw. O God, send us a David that can see where he's standing, that 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min can look out and see God made a promise what, how He's going to do it today. God said it right here in His Word, how He would do it. [I Chronicles 13:8-14]\n\nL-148 God told Micaiah. Micaiah examined his vision before four hundred dignified prophets. He examined his vision to see if it was right. He looked back to what the prophet said before him, to see what happened. He looked back, and he saw that Elijah standing there, said, \"Ahab, the dogs will lick your blood, too.\" Now, he seen then that that vision was just exactly according to the Word of God, so he pronounced it. And he was right. Right. No matter what the rest of them said, he stayed right with that Word. [I Kings 21:19]\n\nL-149 Now let's look at the vision we have today. Is it building churches; is it new things; is it great things that's going to happen? Or, is it judgment? Look back and see the promise of today, see what season we are living in.\n\nL-150 You say, \"Well, bless God, brother, I'm sincere. I joined church. I got my bachelors of art. I done this.\" That's alright, that's fine, nothing against it; so had David, so had the priests of that day, so had the theologians. But it was contrary to the Word. [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-151 God said how He would do it today, how He would restore all things, what He would do again. He promised to restore. That's exactly right. In Joel 2:28, He promised He would restore. \"I will restore,\" saith the Lord, \"all the years that the cankerworm's eat.\" They got a di-... See, that's the same worm; it's in a different stage of life. And when Catholicism started eating, then Lutheran, and Methodist, and Pentecostals, and all, down; He said, \"I will restore everything back to a Church exactly like that one was at the first place.\" [Joel 2:28]\n\nL-152 Watch the vision the other night. Exactly the same Bride come this side, come this side. After that prostitutes passed with their gowns on, their old things up this a way, and dancing by rock-and-roll, and calling themselves the Church. You say, \"Well, we don't do that.\" That's the way God sees you. It ain't what you see your own self. It's the way God sees you. No man sees hisself wrong. When you look in the mirror of God's Word, It tells you whether you're wrong or not. If David would have done that, he'd seen his wrong. If Ahab would have done that, or them prophets would have done that, they would seen themselves wrong. [I Chronicles 13:1-14], [I Kings 22:5-40]\n\nL-153 A vindicated prophet said, \"Ahab will die, and the dogs will lick his blood.\" And his prophecy was exactly with It. Then he knowed he was right. Even Jehosaphat should have seen that and knowed it. When Micaiah saw the vision, he wasn't much with the people in them days, but he had THUS SAITH THE LORD. He was right.\n\nL-154 Notice, we are bringing this thing now in this day, when we see the great hour that we're coming. Notice what David was trying to do, too. I had a little note here on that. He was trying to bring the ark to the city of David, his own denomination.\n\nL-155 Look back yonder when the Lord first spoke down here on the river, \"As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming...\" Brother, the Assemblies couldn't stand for that, neither could the United, all of them. They had to have one somewhere. Ah, they all had to do it, see, just exactly. All of them had to bring it to their own house.\n\nL-156 Wanted to bring it to the city of David. Why? There was no place ready for it. [I Chronicles 15:1-3] And that's the reason you can't bring the Message to a denomination. The Word, the Ark, Christ, \"the same yesterday, today, and forever,\" and all His identification, you can't bring It to your organization. They'll never believe It, because there is no room for It. Don't the Bible say He was outside the church of the Laodicean Age, trying to get in? [Hebrews 13:8] There was no place in the city of David, no matter how loyal it was, and how great it was, and--and so forth. It still wasn't the place. It was going to be at Jerusalem. That's where it went laterwhen the prophet told them what to do with it. See? So David had to bring it to his own city. No place ready for it. [I Chronicles 13:1-3]\n\nL-157 Christ is our Ark, and they won't receive It. Christ is the Word; they won't receive It. They want their creed, their denomination, a new ark, or--or a new carrier. They want the denomination to carry It; a new ark. Huh! 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min Remember, Christ our Ark! You believe Christ is the Word? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] That's the Ark, then. Is that right? All right. Christ cannot be carried, to His correct position, by any denominational cart. He deals with one person, and not with a group. He never did deal with a group; one person. When, He said He'll not. If He did, He contrary-ed His Word, Amos 3:7. You can't make It lie. No, sir. It's Truth. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-158 But, see, they try. The Ark cannot be carried by an organization. There is too many heads in it. See? It cannot be done. He promised He would not do it, and He won't do it. He said... when He promised--when He promised to do it some other way? That's the reason He promised He wouldn't do it. Don't think them thoughts. I can feel it. See? [I Chronicles 15:1-3]\n\nL-159 So He--He promised He would do it a certain way, and anything contrary to that He won't do it. See? But by His original way, according what He said in Amos 3:7, that's the way He'll do it. And that must be a vindicated and proved to be right. Now, you know what He promised today, then He's doing it today. That's just what He said He would do. He would open those Seven Seals, and what all He'd do; reveal the mysteries back there, how these baptisms and all things had been all messed up. And here it is, in His very Presence. Science proves it. The heavens has declared it. Man standing, looking right at it, and see it happen. Not one thing has He said but what He made true. There you are. Just so that you would see where we're at today. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-160 Now, any man that has His Spirit's, knows that; has God's Spirit upon him, knows This is the Truth, because God's Spirit won't speak contrary to the Word. No, no. It'll be right with the Word. You say, \"I got the Holy Ghost. I shouted; I spoke in tongues. I danced in the Spirit.\" That don't mean one thing to God. See? David did the same, practically the same thing, back there. They sang with all of his might, and he shouted with all of his might. All the rest of them did, and they was walking right into death. That's right. That don't have anything to do with it. [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-161 It's the Word that counts, the Word of the Lord. \"They that wait upon the Lord.\" Yes, sir. See, they that have God's Spirit in them, look at the promise for today, and watch and wait until they see It. Then they say, \"That's It.\" God reveals It to them. [Isaiah 40:31]\n\nL-162 Like Nathanael. Philip went and found Nathanael. Nathanael said, \"Now wait a minute. I know that's promised, but let me see It.\" And when he saw It, he said, \"That's It.\" The woman said, \"Now, I know, I've heard all kinds of theologians. I've done this and that. And I've read the Bible, myself, and I know that we're... There is a Messiah coming, that will do these things, so You must be His prophet.\" He said, \"I am He.\" [John 1:45-49], [John 4:1-26]\n\nL-163 She said, \"Come on, see a Man, this is It.\" She waited until she seen that Messiah identified by the Word of God, then she said, \"That's what we've waited on, four hundred years. We haven't had a prophet or nothing. Here He is, and He Himself says that He is He.\" [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]\"... on out and see a Man Who told me the things I've done.\" [John 4:29] But the priests wanted to kill Him, and they finally done it. See? But they can't kill His Spirit today. That's right. No, they can't kill It. It was here to bring us in, so we're thankful. Notice how great God is, how great His works are, how it can never fail!\n\nL-164 Now, God has a provided and original way to do things, and He'll never do it contrary to that.\n\nL-165 Now He promised in the last days that what He would do. And It sent them, us the Message; and this Message would have the same identification as Elijah had, as Elisha had, as John the Baptist had. And It would turn the hearts of the people, not to the denomination, but back to the original, apostolic fathers, back to the Word. How these things have been a vindicated. How that in the sounding of the last angel, Revelations 10, \"In the days of the seventh angel, these mysteries that's all been...\" [Malachi 4:5-6] \"Why did the Methodist do this, and the Baptist, and the church of Christ, and the Jehovah Witness, all do that?\" 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min \"Them mysteries will be revealed in the last day, when the seven angel's... seventh angel's Message, when he...\" Not when he starts out doing this, but, \"When he begins to sound his Message.\" See? Not the years in preparation, but, \"When he begins to sound the Message, these mysteries then will be revealed.\" And here they are; not knowing them, and you people are a witness of that. [Revelation 10:7]\n\nL-166 And then in that great observatory, so that the world will be without, they're still wondering what happened. In Tucson, them big observatories took the picture of it up there; still wondering what happened. What is it? They still put in the paper, \"Does anybody know anything about what, how it could have happen?\" There is no fog up there, there's no air, there's no moisture; thirty miles high in the air. Oh, my! \"There shall be signs in the heaven above. And when these things take place, earthquakes in divers places, then shall appear the sign in the heaven, of the Son of man.\" \"That day,\" in Luke, \"the Son of man will reveal Himself again; being revealed, Hisself.\" And the world will look like Sodom and Gomorrah. Oh, my! Brethren, don't be ignorant of spiritual things, see. \"Search the Scriptures, for in Them you think Eternal, you have Eternal Life; and They are They that testify of the Word.\" They are They that testify of the Truth, the things that God is doing in this hour. [Luke 17:30], [John 5:39]\n\nL-167 And now what? They that have the Spirit of God, wait for these things. And when they see those things, they believe those things. Jesus said, \"No man can come to Me except My Father draws him. And all that the Father has given Me,\" He is the Word, \"they will come to Me. They will come to Me.\" [John 6:37-40, 44]\n\nL-168 I've been pretty rough this morning, see. They wait on the Lord, waiting; and when they do, and they see that promise of today, being vindicated, it renews their faith in His Word. Cause, He promised to do it, and here He is doing it. Then there's no doubt. God speaks. His Word, first, speaks. And then the Spirit that's a bringing It does the thing that the Word said It would do. [Isaiah 40:31] Oh, we have lots of impersonations. We'll still have a lot of them, man of sincere heart trying to do things this way and that way, but watch what happened. People will put their hands, and then--then die. See, notice.\n\nL-169 No man's scheme of denomination will ever work, making members for their own self-made denominational arks. God never did have a denomination. He never will have a denomination. And it's a man-made thing.\n\nL-170 And I wonder, today, if all of our drawing in and great crusades and revivals, we haven't been filling up the Methodist ark, the Baptist ark, the Presbyterian ark! But what about the Ark of Christ, the Word? And if the Bride is to be the Word, then She's got to be of Christ, part of the Bridegroom. She's got to be the Word; the Word not for His day; the Word of this day, that He promised would be this day, that He sent His Word forth to mold His Bride and make Her. Hope we see it! Don't get some idea of your own now, and don't take somebody else's idea. Take the vindicated Word here, the Bible. It says. God has promised in His Word how He would choose His Bride in this last day. Did you know that? He promised it, how He would do it, and that by His original plan of choosing Christ, of choosing the times, choosing the seasons, how he... He can't miss it, on His Bride, because She is part of that Word. He can't choose It by a denomination, when He didn't choose Christ by a denomination. Did Christ come to a denomination? Did He come by a denomination? No. They rejected Him. Well, that's what the denomination done then. Then when He chooses a Bride, can He come any other way? How did He bring Christ here? By the Word of the prophets. Is that right? How will He bring His Bride here? By the Word of the prophets. How did He identify Him when He come? By a man with the spirit of Elijah upon him, come out of the wilderness. How will He identify His Bride? He promised in Malachi 4 the same thing, before He destroyed the earth, like it was in the days of Sodom. [Malachi 4:5-6], [Ephesians 5:27]\n\nL-171 Remember, Sodom burned. Is that right? Well, this world is to burn. Jesus said so. And it'll be the time, that, like Luke the 17th chapter and the 30th verse said, \"In the days it'd be like Sodom and Gomorrah, then the Son of man would be revealed.\" And then what would happen? According to Malachi, He will burn the earth again, and the righteous (in the 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min Millennium) will walk out upon the ashes of the wicked. Is that right? See? [Malachi 4:5-6] So we're right at the end time. We're setting here at the door now, waiting for Him to come. [Luke 17:28-30]\n\nL-172 Notice, God promised in His Word that He would choose His Bride by His original way. He chose His. The Bridegroom! He foretold it by the prophets, and sent a prophet to identify it. The prophet said, standing on the banks of Jordan, \"Behold!\" They said, \"You're the Messiah, aren't you?\" He said, \"No, I'm not the Messiah.\" \"You must be the Messiah.\" [John 1:15-23]\n\nL-173 \"But I'm not Him. But He is standing among you. And His shoes, I'm not worthy to loosen. When He comes, makes Hisself known...\" And today He is standing among us, in the person of the Holy Ghost, manifesting Hisself more and more, coming into His Church, making Hisself known; because, Him, and the Bride and the Groom will be the same, making Hisself known. And one day you'll see that the One that you feeled in your heart, and see His identification, will become personalized before you, then you and He are One. You've united by the Word. And the Word, was in the beginning, will go back to the beginning, which is God. \"And that day you'll know that I am in the Father, the Father in Me; I in you, and you in Me.\" Hallelujah! We're here. Hallelujah! I'm so glad to see Him personifying Himself right among us, and see what He promised for the Word; not what's somebody's emotion, singing, and jumping, and dancing. But by His Word, amen, He is making Himself known. [Mark 1:7], [Luke 3:16], [Acts 13:25], [John 14:20]\n\nL-174 Look, when they brought, built the temple and brought the ark into it, God went in there with a Pillar of Fire. Amen. It was David jumping and screaming, it was all the singers and the priests a carrying on, when they was out of the will of God. But when God identified the ark in His place and position, before they could get the ark in there, here come the Pillar of Fire leading the way; right down over the cherubims' wings, and right in behind the Holiest of holies, His resting place; the Pillar of Fire! And the glory of God was in there, till the pe-... they couldn't even see how to minister. Amen. It'll close the eyes of every theologian, when He comes for His Bride. She'll be taken up in the--in the middle of the night, as it was, to them. They won't even see Her go. Oh, praise be to God! [I Chronicles 13:1-14], [I Chronicles 15:1-4, 11-28]\n\nL-175 Notice, God promised that He would bring His Bride out, what He would do. There would be a Seed. There would be a Light in the evening time, how He would do all these things, just exactly, and by the way that He original planned it in the Old Testament and the New Testament. And it isn't through denomination. It isn't through our system we're using today. We're just causing death. Let people put their hands with It, and die from it. See? [Zechariah 14:6-7]\n\nL-176 The Word, the evening Message, must carry evening results. The evening Message must sow evening Seed, not morning seed. Evening Seed! Is that right? The midday scene, its seeds back there, was denomination; it died, perished. But evening-time Message will show evening-time Light, will show evening-time results; the evening-time Message! [Zechariah 14:6-7] Jesus' time, midday message, showed midday results. The beginning message showed the beginning results, made creation. He made His Son in His Own image, in the midday. In the evening time He makes a Bride for It. See? What by? His Word. How did He form the earth? How did He speak it into existence? By His Word! Who was His Son? The Word! \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelled among.\" [John 1:1-5, 9-14] How will He take His Bride? By the Word; not by a new cart, not by some theologian's idea. But according to His Word He'll identify Her. Don't put one thing to It or take one thing from It now. Leave It the way It is. See?\n\nL-177 The evening time, He promised He would reveal, though, open these Seven Seals and show what them churches 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min had missed back there. Revelations 10, and Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, He said He would do it. Now let's not mix it up. Let's keep it right like that. [Revelation 10:7], [Luke 17:30], [Malachi 4:1-6]\n\nL-178 Let me, in closing... It's about, pretty near fifteen minutes until twelve. Let me close, in saying this. Friends, listen, in the Name of the Lord Jesus! These things are too plain for you not to believe It. It's too plain for you not to see It. Surely you can see That! Surely the world could see It! But just your... Don't be influenced by these new fandangles and things they got today; I don't care how good a man they are, how sincere they are. \"If they don't speak according to the law and the prophets,\" the Bible said, \"there is no Life in them.\" See? [John 6:53]\n\nL-179 David thought he was right. He was sincere. Them priests thought they were right. They were sincere. But they just failed to consult the Lord about it. And how could they a done it? Maybe they said, \"We prayed through.\" But that wasn't God's way of doing it. He promised that He would do nothing until first He revealed it to His servants the prophets. And there stood Nathan-ael right among them, and never consulted him at all. [Amos 3:7], [I Chronicles 13:1-14], [I Chronicles 15:1-3, 25-29]\n\nL-180 Now read the next few chapters of Chronicles there, and you'll find out. When David set in the house, and said, \"Is it right,\" and Nathan-ael was setting with him, \"that I should have, live in the cedar, and--and the ark of God under the tents out here?\" And Nathan-ael found, from the Lord, what to tell him to do. [I Chronicles 17:1, 8]\n\nL-181 And he had done done wrong, so then God said, \"Tell My servant David I love him. I made him a name like great men in the earth, but I can't let him do it,\" see, \"he done failed Me. See, I can't let him do it. I'll bring a man along, his son, shall raise the everlasting house of God.\" And that was David, of course. Which, Solomon typed it, but then he failed. Every man has got to fail. Every human being has got to fail. God is the only One that can't fail. He can't fail. That's one thing God cannot do, is fail. And God is the Word. And the Word, no matter how it looks like it's going to come this other way, it'll come just exactly the way the Word said. [I Chronicles 17:1-15]\n\nL-182 Now remember, you've got to follow the season, the time. See? And what season you're in, what time, and make that a vindicated, to see that it's exactly the Truth. [Ecclesiastes 3:1]\n\nL-183 Now take all these musts, all the Word, all the types, and the things, and look where you're setting. Think of the hour we're living in. Looky yonder, that nearly one-tenth of the earth is ready to fall in. Science says that. They're looking on the clock. Few years ago, said, \"It's only three minutes now till midnight.\" Might be a minute, might be a half a minute now. They said, \"It won't happen in our generation.\"\n\nL-184 \"It could happen in five minutes.\" And notice the next thing he said, \"Five years.\" I never said that now. He said that, the scientist. They're swarming away from California like flies. See? Well, the day that Lot went out of Sodom, the same day it rained fire down upon the earth. One of these days God is going to take our Message, and we're going to leave here. Something is going to happen, sure enough, then, when the Church is gone, His Body, His Bride.\n\nL-185 Now I want to read you a Scripture, and I want you to read It with me. I want you to turn to Deuteronomy 4, in closing. I think enough probably has been said, that you'll understand. Deuteronomy 4. I'm going to read two places in here. And to this church, and to the tapes, people on tapes, and people on the hookup across other parts of the nation, I want you to listen to this real close, and don't you fail. This is the thing that I... Deuteronomy, the 4th chapter. I'm going to get the 1st verse. I want to read the 1st verse, then I'm going to read the 25th and the 26th verse. You can read it all when you get home; but just, save time, so we can get out on time, 'cause I've got to come back again tonight, the Lord willing. Listen to this prophet speak. He had been in the Presence of God. He knowed what he was talking about. Listen. Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and to the judgments, which I teach you, for to do 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you. (That types our Millennium.) Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish ought of it, (\"Don't add one thing to It, and don't take one thing away from It. Stay, just say what It says!\") that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you. Your eyes have seen what the LORD did... to Baal-peor: for all the man that followed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God has destroyed them from among you. (\"Now you're a separated people, out of them denominations.\" See? See?) But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God, ye are alive every one of you this day. (\"Ye never died with your denomination. You're alive now, and in the Presence of God.\") Close, don't miss it. 25th verse, now, when they're going into the land, now watch what happened. And when thou shall beget children, and children's children, and you... have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves (that's what happened), and make... graven images (something else), or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger: (Listen!) I call heavens and earth to witness against you this day, see, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land, or the place, where you go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but ye shall utterly be destroyed. [Deuteronomy 4:1-2, 4, 25]\n\nL-186 This was Moses speaking to Israel, after he had been a vindicated by God, by a Pillar of Fire, and knowed he was proven to be God's servant to lead them out. And before they went into the land, before they entered, Moses said, \"Now, the words that I have spoken to you, I call heaven and earth to witness against you. If you add one thing to It, or take one Word from It, you'll not stay in the land where the Lord God gives you.\" So say I, in the Name of Jesus Christ! Don't you add one thing. Don't take, put your own ideas in It. You just say what is said on those tapes. You just do exactly what the Lord God has commanded to do. Don't add to It. [Deuteronomy 4:26]\n\nL-187 He has ever, keeps His promise to us. Every promise that He has made, He's kept it. Has He told you what would happen, and did it happen? I bring heavens and earth before you today, in a challenge. Has God ever said anything that He has not fulfilled and done exactly what He said He would do for us? Hasn't He done it just the way He said He would do it? That's exactly. So will He continue to do it. Just don't add to It. Don't take from It. Just believe It and walk humble before the Lord your God, for we're nearing the going into the Land. Then, you won't return, you won't return to this type of a life again. You'll return as an immortal being. You'll turn, when sin is done away with, when Satan is bound, and for a thousand years you'll live upon this earth that the Lord thy God has given thee. \"For the meek shall inherit the earth.\" \"Blessed is he that doeth all of His commandments, that he might have the right to enter into the City.\" \"For without are sorcerers, liars, whoremongers, and dogs. They shall not enter therein.\" They're only for the Redeemed, and to those who walk in His commandments. [Revelation 22:15, 18], [Matthew 5:5]\n\nL-188 Don't take some new thing. They're flying everywhere, and there'll be more than that come. But don't take these new things. The Lord your God has declared to you what is Truth. The Lord your God has vindicated what is Truth, by His Word and by His Spirit. \"Not by power, not by might, but by My Spirit.\" And, the Spirit, \"God seeks those who worship Him in the Spirit and Truth.\" \"Thy Word is Truth.\" And He has thoroughly a vindicated that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He has showed the evening Seeds to you. He has revealed It to you, in the Word. He has proven It to you, by His Spirit. [Zechariah 4:6], [John 17:17], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-189 Don't never start or try an organization. Don't try to build upon anything else. But stay humble before the Lord your God, for it looks like the gates may open into the promised Land soon. Then let us go in with the true singing and rejoicing, when the Bride and Groom takes its place at the Throne.\n\nL-190 Live humble. Live loving. Love one another. Don't never get nothing among you. If you see something coming 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min up in your heart against somebody, get it out of there right then. Don't let... And Satan will do his best to get among you. See? Don't you let that happen. Some slicked-tongue fellow might come along and try to take you away from It. You think they could talk Moses out of the Presence of God, where he had stood there and seen It? No, sir. No. We don't take from It or add to It. Just keep It the way the Lord said. We don't want no denomination. We don't want no organizations. We don't want no malice. We don't want no strife. We want God, and He is the Word. Now let us bow our head.\n\nL-191 O God, I look around with spiritual eye, I try to see what's taking place. I see Your Word, the way It's been vindicated, the way It's been proven; all the way from thirty-three years ago, down here on the river, what You said. And here it is, thirty-three years later, and You are doing just what You said. And You done just what You said. Lord, far be it from us trying to make It any littler or try to make It any bigger; just keep It the way You've made It, just walk humble and follow You.\n\nL-192 These are they, Lord, that You have given to the ministry, besides all those who sleep across the nation, around the world. The cemeteries here holds many of those waiting, blessed saints. But it's as it said, \"We which are alive and remain shall not hinder those that are asleep. The trumpet will sound, the dead shall rise first; then we'll be caught up with them.\" When the glory of God will be upon the earth, it'll hide the Church away from the world. It won't even see It when It goes. [I Thessalonians 4:15-16]\n\nL-193 Father God, keep these in Your hands. They are Yours. I pray, God, that we'll always walk humble before You. We don't know how long. We don't desire to know how long; it's not our business. That's Your business. It's not our wills to know when You will come. It's our will, Lord, to keep humble till You do come, and walk with You. It's our desire for You to just let Yourself be known, once in a while, Father, among us, that we can see that we're still walking with You.\n\nL-194 Forgive us of our past sins. Guide us and protect us from every snare of the devil, for the future. Lead us and guide us, O God our Father. Forgive our sins and help us to be Your children. We're a poor class of people. We're an outcast, by the societies of this world, by the denominations of the churches. We see the end. And we thank Thee for spiritual eyesight into Thy Word, to see the end time, for all these things must come to that great stoning from Heaven. Help us, Lord, not to be here at that day, but to be gone into Your Presence, fly away into Your bosom.\n\nL-195 Heal the sick and the afflicted, Lord. We pray that tonight You'll give us such a great service, may there not be a feeble person in our midst, because of Your Presence, Lord. May our hearts continually be set on Thee. And we know, Lord, that money, property, things of the world have no meanings, just so temporal. All of them must go. Our jobs, our places, our friends, everything must go. No matter how rich, how poor, how popular or unpopular we are, it all must go. But there is only one thing that our being here is centered around, and that's Jesus Christ. So, God, let us lay aside everything as secondarily, and hold to Him. And He is the Word. Grant it, Lord.\n\nL-196 The vindicated Word of the hour! The vindicated Word of the days of Moses was Jesus. The vindicated Word of the day of Isaiah, Elijah, John, all, was Jesus. And the vindicated Word today is Jesus, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Help us, Lord, to believe that, see that, and walk in it. We--we ask in Jesus' Name.\n\nL-197 With our heads bowed, I wonder if there is some in here that has never truly made that one great, all-sufficient... You believe It, but just to believe It is not enough. I believe that my wife was a good girl. I knowed her father, her mother. I knowed her for years and years. She walked a straight life. I believed she was a good woman, but that didn't make her mine. She never become mine until, she, I accepted her, she accepted me. Now Jesus wants to accept you. Won't you accept Him and become part of His Word? If you haven't done that, with your heads bowed and your hearts bowed, I trust...\n\nL-198 There is no room for an altar call here. I'm not too much on them, anyhow. I believe God visits you right where 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min you are. Would you raise your hands, say, \"Brother Branham, remember me in prayer. I want to do that.\" God bless you. \"I...\" God bless you. My, hands everywhere! \"I want to be like that.\" God bless you, brother. Bless you, brother; all of you, around. \"I want to be that.\" God bless... \"I truly want to be that. I--I see it.\" Well, now, look, friend, there may be a little something... If you're not that, then there is something you've centered around besides that. You're as close to it, you're looking at it. You see it. You've seen it for years, moving up. You see it coming matured now. If that means everything to us, and nothing else is going to last but That, why not just turn your head from that thing you've been looking at and center yourself on Him? Which, the center of all life, all hereafter, is Him. Won't you do it, while we pray together?\n\nL-199 Dear God, as hands of man, women, boys, girls, even ministers, got their hands up. They--they wanted to--to say that they wanted to become centered right around the Lord Jesus, and yet looks like they can't do it. There is something pulls them this way, that way. It might be a denomination, it might be a person, it might be a sin, it might be something they're hiding in their heart. I don't know, Lord. Thou knowest. Whatever it is, may just now, Lord, while on others Thou art calling... You've done called them. They're Yours. And while You call them, may they turn loose of that, that besetting sin, as the Bible said. \"Turn away from that sin that so easily beset us, that we might run with patience the race that's set before us, looking to...\" What, to our job, to our denomination, to our affiliation, to the councils? \"To Christ the author and finisher of the faith that we have in Him.\" Do that, Father, for us today, for we ask it in His Name and for His glory.\n\nL-200 Now they're Yours, Lord. Do with them as You see fit. Do with us as You see fit. We are Yours. In Jesus' Name. Amen. I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree.\n\nL-201 Have you forgotten about dinner? Have you forgotten whether the kids are all right, out in the car, or not? Have you forgotten all about the past, and realized what that is you're feeling right now? It's materializing before you, day by day. See? Let that be the center of whatever. Let the rest of the things go away; they're going to perish, anyhow. Oh, just keep following after Him! See? As Elisha followed Elijah, let's follow Him. For we must be taken up, too, someday. We seen the chariot of Fire that lifted Him out of the grave. We feel It among us now. Someday He is going to unhook the horses from the bushes. We're going up. Don't you love Him? And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree. Oh, can't you just almost just close your eyes and see Him hanging yonder? I love Him, (who else could I love?) I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree.\n\nL-202 Every time when I return home, somebody is gone. I'll be gone a few months, come back, somebody is gone. I get sad every time I come. The other day, a boy I went to school with, coming down the street, he said, \"Hello, Billy.\"\n\nL-203 I looked at him, he used to be a handsome little fellow, real black shiny hair combed back; now it's as white as snow. He used to be so straight; tummy way out like this. I said, \"Hello, Jim.\" I looked at him. I felt in my heart, I thought, \"God, that boy and I, that man and I, are the same age.\" Then, I know my days are numbered. I know it can't be too much longer. I look around, and think, \"What can I do, Lord? Help me. I don't want to go ahead of You. I want to stay right--right behind You. You lead the way.\" I look, and think, \"Fifty-six years old, oh, my, can't be much longer!\"\n\nL-204 And I look down, see my good friend Bill Dauch setting there, seventy-two or seventy-three years old. I look 65-0718M, Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min around, I see these kids, they think, \"Well, I'll wait till I get as old as Brother Branham, I'll think that.\" Honey, you may never see that. I doubt very much you seeing it. See? But, just think, if Brother Bill Dauch lives through this day, he'll out-live hundreds of fifteen-, sixteen-year-old people. They're dying every hour. So what difference does it make what age you are! What are you doing about the hour you're living in? What are you doing for Jesus at this time? See? Oh, I want to see Him. I want to see the hour I look and see all these old bodies transformed, see them \"changed in a moment, in a twinkle.\" If that isn't so, then we're most foolish people; eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you die; see, you're just like a animal, you die and go to the dirt and that's all. But there's a mortal... immortal soul living in you, brother. We done heard from Heaven. We done seen it proven. We know that He is, and a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him. Now, members of the Body of Christ, while we sing that again, I want you just set in your seats and shake one another's hands while we sing that again. I... (just greet your brother, sister) I love Him Because... (Richard!)... me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree.\n\nL-205 Do you love Him? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Do you love His Word? Say, \"Amen.\" [\"Amen!\"] You love His cause? Say, \"Amen.\" [\"Amen!\"] Do you love His Body? Say, \"Amen!\" [\"Amen.\"] Then, you love one another. Amen! That's right. \"This will all men know you're My disciples, when you have love one for the other.\" Now I've laid my hands on these handkerchiefs, if you have to get them before night. [John 13:35]\n\nL-206 I'm going to have Brother Richard Blair... God answered his prayer, him and the brother here, praying the other day, for to bring back this little boy that sets among us today, that's a living, because of their faith in God. And now I'm going to have him to dismiss us in a word of prayer, just in a few moments, so we can come back again tonight. Just about five minutes after twelve, by that clock. And I want you come back tonight, if you can, if you're around. If you have to go home, may God speed you on your road, and help you, and protect you. If you can stay, and want to stay, you're welcome to stay. God be with you now. Till we meet! till we meet! Till... (let's raise our hands to Him)... meet at Jesus' feet; Till we meet! till we meet! God be with you till we meet again. [Brother Branham begins to hum God Be With You--Ed.] That's the way to leave the house of God, prayerfully, humbly, trusting we'll meet again tonight. If we don't, \"God be with you till we meet again!\" Let's bow our heads now. Brother Blair. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

Let us bow our heads now. Father God, that's our sincere prayer tonight, seeing all that You are doing for the people in this day. And we ask You, Lord, may we only believe, just believe It's the Truth, the written Word being made manifest to us. Grant these things, Father.\n\nL-2 Now tonight we want to thank You for the--the Light that You throwed on the Scriptures for us this morning. And we pray tonight, Lord, in that prayer line, that You will vindicate Your Word to be the Truth.\n\nL-3 We pray for all the churches and the congregations that's gathered around the--the--the little microphones out across, from the nation, all the way to the West Coast, up unto the mountains of Arizona, down into the plains of Texas, way into the East Coast, all across the country, Lord, where they have gathered. Many hours apart, we are in time, but, Lord, we're together tonight as one unit, believers, waiting for the Coming of the Messiah. We pray, Heavenly Father, that You'll send Him soon for Your Church. For we ask it in His Name. Amen.\n\nL-4 You may be seated. Christian greetings to all that's here tonight. I'm sorry that we're still jammed and packed till we can hardly breathe. Even the air conditioners, as well as it's air conditioned, doesn't have much effect, so many people. If there was hardly just a normal church full of people, those air conditioners would freeze you. But now everyone has got a fan, fanning, and the air conditioner is blowing as hard as it can.\n\nL-5 We send greetings from the East Coast to the West, to all our friends in Christ, who is listening in. We send greetings over in San Jose, Brother Borders, the group up there. We send greetings up in the mountains, Prescott, Arizona, to Brother Leo Mercier and his group that's up there waiting for the Coming of the Lord. We send greetings to those in Tucson, that's gathered tonight, waiting for the Coming of the Lord. Down into Houston, Texas, to those who are waiting for the Coming of the Lord. Up in Chicago, to those who are waiting for the Coming of the Lord. Up on the East Coast, New York and Connecticut, and the great groups up there, that's waiting for the Coming of the Lord. We don't have room here to seat them, so we just have to send them the Word through the--the medium of the telephone. We send greetings to Brother Junior Jackson tonight, and his group down in Clarksville. Brother Ruddell, up on sixty-two, and his group, waiting for the Coming of the Lord. And we're gathered here tonight at the home church, the tabernacle, waiting for the Coming of the Lord.\n\nL-6 And now, many of you maybe wasn't at the services this morning. But I trust that everyone, that wasn't, will get that tape, for I believe that it was the most straightest Message to the church since the--the Message of Sirs, What Time Is It? I felt the anointing of the Spirit, felt led to say what I did. It was long, but yet I felt led to do it. And I think the Lord, by His Word, showed that what hour we're living. And make sure that we understand these mysterious things that's happening. You know, the Bible said, \"The wise shall understand.\" [Daniel 12:10]\n\nL-7 But the nations and the people will grow \"weaker and wiser.\" Just think, the average American now is in middle age, about twenty years old, weaker but wiser. They didn't have jet planes in them days, and--and atomic warheads, but they lived a lot longer. We're getting weaker and wiser, and our own wisdom is what's going to destroy us. We will destroy ourselves. God will not destroy us; our wisdom will destroy us. It's always been that way, and so will it be again.\n\nL-8 Now, the Lord willing, next Sunday morning, not knowing now what I will speak on, but I trust that the Lord, if He lets us live and nothing happens, and it be His will, we aim to speak another Message next Sunday morning, have prayer for the sick next Sunday night. Then it falls my lot to return back home to Arizona, to take the family back so 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min the children can register in school. Then you'll be... We'll notify you, just as we can, of the meetings as they mature, or the times that we... places that we aim to be. So, God bless you all.\n\nL-9 Now tonight, knowing that it's... I'm fifteen minutes late, to begin with, quarter till eight here in Jeffersonville; and that's about a quarter to nine at the East Coast, and then it's about five o'clock on the West Coast. So now we are just about sundown here. And I want to speak to you for just a short service, to try to find the anointing of the Spirit, and then call the prayer line.\n\nL-10 And I want the congregation here, as well as the congregation assembled at other places, find some man, some brother that's anointed by the Spirit; and when we start praying for the sick, go lay hands upon those that's in your congregation. Remember, God is omnipresent; He is everywhere. So, down in Texas, over in California, up in Arizona, wherever you are, lay hands on those that are sick when we start praying for the sick. And I'm sure God will hear and answer prayer.\n\nL-11 Strange thing, last Sunday night, and the anointing was going on, and the Holy Spirit... It was quite a thing. I hadn't had a--a line of discernment for months and months, since I was here the other time. And then to walk up there under a promise... You don't know that He'll do it. You can't say He'll do it. You've just got to walk up there and wait. He is sovereign. He does what He wants to. But stand there and wait to see what He will do, then feel It break through on you like that.\n\nL-12 And at the end of the--the meeting, not knowing who it was, but there had been a--a man somewhere along the line that was tall, and bald on top, and he was a very sick person.\n\nL-13 And then right at last, there was a man appeared here on the platform, and had his head down, and looked like he was suffering, holding himself around the stomach. And I thought that must be that first man or second man, or when ever it was that I prayed for him, 'cause he was bald and was holding his head down; a large man, stooped over. But I looked around and I found the gentleman sitting out there, but he was rejoicing. I thought, \"Where is it?\" I couldn't decide where it was at. I could feel it and see the man before me. I felt it pull around this way, and it was coming from back. I looked at Brother Neville and these two sitting here, it wasn't them. I said, \"The man is on the inside of that baptistry back there.\" And you know who it was? Brother Shepherd. The reason I couldn't recognize him, he was sitting back there with his head bowed, praying.\n\nL-14 He thought he was going to die, has thought that for the last few weeks. His wife told him go get a new pair of shoes, and he said, \"I won't need them. I won't be here that long.\" And he met me the other day in the... up there in the yard, Brother Wood's, a shouting and praising God. Said, \"I'm eating bacon, eggs, tomatoes, anything I want.\"\n\nL-15 And humbly giving up his seat, getting back in there out of the way, and praying. See, you don't need a prayer card, you only need faith. See? Now, I didn't know whether he was healed or not, I just said, \"A--a man, praying, he's got something wrong.\" I think It called what it was, \"Stomach trouble, and praying back behind here. The Lord Jesus make you well.\" Now, that's all I could tell. The pull was that he was praying. I could see it, but what happens I don't know. See?\n\nL-16 But when you hear It come back, everybody is aware, when It says, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD,\" see, that's not me speaking no more then; that's Him.\n\nL-17 But I always say, \"Jesus Christ has made you whole,\" that's exactly the Truth. \"He was wounded for our transgressions, with His stripes we were healed.\" See? See? [Isaiah 53:5]\n\nL-18 But when It comes, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD,\" and tells you what to do and what's going to happen, watch that, it'll be that way.\n\nL-19 But when I say, \"Jesus Christ heals you and makes you whole,\" you believe it, 'cause He's already said it. I'm just repeating what He said.\n\nL-20 And a vision is just repeating what He showed. You understand? 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min\n\nL-21 Now may we hurry up and get right into the Word, because I know that many of you are here, got long miles to travel tonight. I pray that God will bless you, help you and protect you along the roads. And now I wish to turn tonight to Saint Matthew, the 21st chapter, and verses 1 to 11, in Saint Matthew. And, now, if you don't have your Bible, or if you want to jot down these Scriptures, all right. [Matthew 21:1-11]\n\nL-22 And now to you who never heard the Message this morning, and you have a tape recorder; we never solicit, selling tapes. We never solicit, selling anything. Sometimes in a big meeting they'll announce they got some books back there; we don't make anything out of them. Brother Vayle is the writer. The tapes, the man that operates the tape business there will tell you, we don't make no tape money. We don't... It ain't \"the tapes\"; it's the Message. And when a man gets on his mind that it's money, he ain't going to make tapes no more. That's right. I was asking about it, I think our tapes sell about, under five dollars, or something, three to five, or something like that. What say? Three and four, for them big, long tapes.\n\nL-23 And a certain minister, I asked about one of his tapes, and it was nine dollars, about twenty minutes or thirty, of a message.\n\nL-24 So I see that our Brother Sothmann back there is not getting rich, any of them, on these tapes that they're--they're putting out. See, they make just enough to get by on it. Can't ask them to make them for nothing, because they have to buy the tapes and everything else. And the machinery is very expensive, costs about ten thousand dollars to get set up to make those tapes, to begin with.\n\nL-25 Now, I understand soon I... have announced it yet. But there's a tape hearing again. Every so often we... the trustees, I have nothing to do with it at all. I don't even... never at none of the meetings. It's neither--neither pro nor con. They turn in their bids; the trustees decide who is the next man to make tapes, and they send him a letter. That's all I know about it. They take care of that, because I can't even dedicate babies let alone take care of tapes, so, or baptize.\n\nL-26 So I've got my mind set on this Message, that's that Third Pull, and it's the one I must be loyal and reverent to.\n\nL-27 Matthew 21:1 to 11. I said that so you could be watching for the... or turning to the Scriptures. And when the... And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives,... Jesus sent two of his disciples, And saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them to me. And if any man say ought unto you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them; and straightway he will send them. This was all done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughters of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek,... sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass. And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, And they brought the--the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon. And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; and others cut down branches from the trees, and strew them in the way. And the multitude that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest. And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.[Matthew 21:1-11]\n\nL-28 Now if I would take a text from that, for about thirty minutes before the prayer line begins, I would like to take this for a text: What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?\n\nL-29 Now, it had been a very weary, nervous day, and it was an unusual day. We find Jesus here coming up to Jerusalem, ready to attend the passover. And the passover is where the pascal lamb was killed, and the blood was 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min spread upon the mercy seat for the--the atonement for--for the people. And He had come up from Bethphage and had come to the top of the Mount of Olives, which looks down upon another little hill where Jerusalem was built. And as He looked, and knowed that this was His final visit. [Matthew 21:1], [Luke 19:28-31], [Mark 11:1], [Leviticus 16:5-9, 14-16]\n\nL-30 This was the time that when He would be delivered into the hands of sinful man and they would kill Him. He would die the horriblest death that was ever died by a mortal, and be buried. He would be betrayed by His Own, some of them standing right with Him. And Him, being God, knew what was in their hearts, and knew from the beginning who would betray Him. And knowed that man was with Him who set by His side and counted His money to Him, and so forth, knowed that man would betray Him. And knew that a cruel Roman cross waited for Him out there. He knew that His water in His body and the Blood of His body would separate, and that the Blood would drop off of His forehead, great big drops like perspiration. He knew all that was before Him. And He stands upon the mountain, looking over to Jerusalem. [Luke 22:44]\n\nL-31 The people of that day, the... what they called that day, \"a better religious class of people,\" hated Him. The churches of that day hated Him and denounced Him, and denounced all that listened to Him. And if they went and attended His campaigns, they were immediately excommunicated from the fellowship of the church. No wonder the Scripture said, \"He came unto His Own, and His Own received Him not.\" The ones who ought to have loved Him, the ones who ought to have been for Him, was His bitter, bitterest enemies. [John 1:11]\n\nL-32 And He had made up His little group out of a bunch of poor people, fishermen, tax gatherers, uneducated. The Bible said some of them was even \"ignorant, unlearned.\" Some could not even sign their name. He never went to the churches to get His people. [Acts 4:13]\n\nL-33 And He never agreed with any of the church leaders. And, besides that, He followed the very trend of a prophet. He condemned everything that they done, as the ones before Him had; because they were a portion of the Word, and He was the Word in Its fullness. [Luke 13:14-16], [Matthew 12:10-14]\n\nL-34 But in the midst of all of it, through every age and every prophet that had been or would be, there is going to be a certain amount of people that's predestinated to hear that Message, and they'll follow It. Those ignore the crowds. They ignore the criticism of the unbeliever. They--they have no argument with them. They've got one thing to do, that's believe and to get every bit of It they can, soak It in like Mary who set at the feet of Jesus. [John 6:39]\n\nL-35 And Martha was fixing His dinner, and Jesus said to her, \"But, Martha, you are so concerned about the things of life, but Mary has sought the better things,\" see, the things of Eternal Life. [Luke 10:41]\n\nL-36 Now, we find that many of the people that had understood... They didn't have literature as we have today, they didn't have television or telephones, or anything, of that day, but had been kind of breezed around that He was going to be at the passover. For many of the people, being spiritual-minded, knew that He was that passover Lamb, because He had already told them the things that was going to happen.\n\nL-37 And then, of course, knowing that He was to be there, and loved Him the way they did, they was waiting for Him. There was a crowd that was probably pushing, shoving from one gate to the other one, watching out in every way, for they knew that one of the hours He would appear. They were watching.\n\nL-38 Others were wondering what was the matter with these people running from gate to gate. \"What's the attraction?\"\n\nL-39 And they would look this way and look that way, to find out. Looked like they were looking for something, under expectation of something going to happen.\n\nL-40 Oh, how I would like to change my text for a few minutes and say this, that that's what's the matter today. The people who are looking for Him coming is under great anticipation and expectations. We can feel it, the pressure. And they are seeking, watching every move and every sign, comparing it with the Scriptures.\n\nL-41 And when they seen all those things that was predicted of Him, right up to the end, they knowed the end was nigh. They wanted to be there, so they watched. Part of the crowds was for Him, in the minority. Some was against Him, most of them, ninety percent was against Him. 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min\n\nL-42 And that's about the way it is today in the religious crowds, when it really come down to the Word and Christ, there's about one percent that would believe It. The other part wouldn't pay any attention to It, no matter what was done, they would pass off some kind of a joke or throw a slam about It. Just about the same. Time, things don't change very much, history just repeats itself around.\n\nL-43 Well, we find that drawed a nervous tension. It had to. It must do it. They were waiting, they were wondering what He would do when He got there. They wanted to be there to get anything that He done. They wanted It. They wanted to see It. They believed Him. Others had heard He was coming, and they went up there to make fun of Him. So after all the nervous anticipation, a very unusual day, very unusual time, churches asleep, the people's nerve was on edge, there was so many people there, and then it happened!\n\nL-44 On top of Mount Olive come a little, white donkey coming, walking down the hill, with a group of people fanatically screaming, pulling off palms' leaves off the trees, throwing their clothes in the road, screaming, \"Hosanna to the Son of David that comes in the Name of the Lord!\" The... this little mule, his Rider was none other than God's anointed Messiah of the hour. [Matthew 21:9]\n\nL-45 God, then, what was He doing? What is that attraction up there on the hill? It's God making history, and God fulfilling prophecy. And that always causes an attraction. It brings all the critics up, the vultures (of this morning's Message), and the eagles also. See? They come together to find out what's going on. Some coming for curiosity, some coming to find fault, others coming to criticize. There's all kinds gathered, as we said this morning: believers, make-believers, and unbelievers. What's on the mountain? Prophecy is being fulfilled. Now we'll see what takes place.\n\nL-46 Now, in the Book of Zechariah, in the 9th chapter and the 9th verse. Zechariah, one of the prophets, spoke in the Spirit, saying this. Rejoice greatly, O daughters of Zion; shout, O daughters of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just,... having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, upon the foal, a colt the foal of an ass. [Zechariah 9:9]\n\nL-47 Now, what was the matter with those scribes? What was the matter with those priests? What was the matter with those religious people? This was wrote four hundred and eighty-seven years before it happened, by a vindicated prophet, and was already put into writings and called the Bible, the scrolls of the Old Testament. Why couldn't they see that that's prophecy being fulfilled? The same reason they can't see it today. They had took the Word of God and made It of non-effect to the people, by teaching (for traditions) for Doctrine the traditions of man. [Matthew 15:9], [II Timothy 3:5]\n\nL-48 And if scribe, preachers, ministers, spiritual man (so-called), anointed ones, would only read the Bible, they wouldn't be wondering what's taking place, they would know what It is. God fulfilling His Word!\n\nL-49 History was being made, prophecy was being fulfilled. Salvation to the world was arriving, the great day that all the prophets had looked forward to. All that was in the grave was waiting for that day (my, think of it), all that had died, all the righteous of the blood of the martyrs and the prophets.\n\nL-50 Which, He had just screamed out, \"Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, you that stone every prophet that I send to you, and kill the righteous, how oft would I have hovered you as a hen did, would her brood, but you would not. But now your hour has come.\" [Luke 13:34-35]\n\nL-51 Everything that was in the grave, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, all the prophets, were waiting for this hour.\n\nL-52 And the church was blind to It. \"Who is this that's causing all of this noise? Who is that Fellow?\" They said one time, \"Is not that the carpenter's son over here? We know Him. Where did He get this wisdom? Why, we don't see Him connected with any of our schools. We don't know any books He ever learned from. Who is It?\"\n\nL-53 He was the answer of the prophet's prophecy. Here He comes, riding upon the foal of an ass. What an attraction! God was fulfilling His promised Word, the hour that had been waiting since four thousand years. In Genesis, the 3rd chapter and the 15th verse, God had made the prediction, \"The Seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head, but his head shall bruise her heel,\" that prophecy down through the Bible that had been predicted of this Man coming. [Genesis 3:15] 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min\n\nL-54 And here just recently there was a prophet who stood up among them, that was vindicated a prophet, Zechariah, and he said, that, \"You daughters of Jerusalem and you daughters of Zion, rejoice, shout, scream out, for your King comes to you, meek and lowly and humble, riding upon the foal of an ass.\" [Zechariah 9:9]\n\nL-55 And here those people that read that Scripture, day by day, watched Him come riding in, and cried, \"Who is this?\" See? God fulfilling His Word to the people that should have knowed what It was, but they didn't know It.\n\nL-56 When God fulfills His Word, It always causes an attraction, always does. Causes an attraction, for It is the unusual. So unusual, when He fulfills His Word to the modern trend of the day, 'cause the modern trend of the day don't believe in It. They have their own way.\n\nL-57 Now, we see, and let us go back in the Scriptures and take some other unusual events, just for a few more minutes, when God fulfilled His prophecy. When God says anything, He's going to do it. All heavens and earth will pass away, but that Word can never pass away. So It usually causes a scene, an unusual scene. [Matthew 5:18], [Matthew 24:35], [Mark 13:30-31], [Luke 21:33], [Luke 16:17]\n\nL-58 Notice how ridiculous that the Word of God to a--a people who is supposed to believe It, and yet It's so unusual they cry out, \"Well, what's this? Where'd you get that stuff? Who is this? What is this?\" When, they ought to have been screaming, \"Hosanna to the King that cometh in the Name of the Lord!\" But there was just a little group doing that, just a little group. Of four thousand years of prophecy, for the greatest thing that could ever happen to the nation, for all the hope of the dead rested upon It, all the future laid in It; and the religious people, that claimed they believe It, was screaming out, \"Who is It? And what's this attraction?\" Something unusual! About the same, it just don't change, now unusual. [Matthew 21:1-11], [Mark 11:1-11], [John 12:12-19], [Zechariah 9:9]\n\nL-59 Let's see some of the unusual things, as I've just said. What was the attraction just before judgment struck the world and destroyed it by water? An old man, around a hundred and twenty years old, building a boat when there was no water to float it in. Up there for years, standing in the door, building away on the interior, on the inside, and pitching it inside and out, and say, \"The world is going to be swallowed up with water,\" the great scientific age. [Genesis 6:13-22]\n\nL-60 \"What is that pounding up on the hill up there?\" \"Why, it's an old man by the name of Noah, and he's up there, an old fanatic. The old man stood in the sun too long. He is sunstroked. He's out of his mind. And he's building what he calls 'an ark,' and saying waters is coming from up there where there is no water, and it's going to float all the people around; and everybody that don't hear his message, and everybody that won't come into that ark, is going to be drowned. Did you ever hear of such a thing?\" It was an unusual attraction! [Genesis 6:13-22]\n\nL-61 I imagine when the people wanted a good laugh, they went up and stood before the ark door and laughed. \"Why, you said it was going to rain a hundred years ago! Grandpa told me he heard you up here saying it was going to rain, and you're still beating around on this old piece of wood up here. Why don't you get next to yourself?\"\n\nL-62 But it was God getting ready to confirm a promise and to fulfill a prophecy that His prophet had made. Very unusual! God fulfilling His promise to Noah, while others was laughing. God was also getting ready to make history to show to others, even to this day, that He keeps His Word! No matter how unreal it seems, and unreasonable, He still keeps His Word. He was making it an example, out of that old man pounding on that ark, for these people here in America tonight and all over the world. No matter what science says, what they say, this, that, or the other, He still keeps His Word. He was making history. [Genesis 7:1-22]\n\nL-63 What was the attraction one day; an unusual thing happened back in the wilderness, and it was a bush that was on fire. And a runaway prophet was standing down in the wilderness. He never heard no voice, he never heard no sound, but he looked and seen an unusual thing up on top of the mountain. God was trying to attract his attention. Same is it today! [Exodus 3:1-10]\n\nL-64 God was getting ready to fulfill His Word, by His prophet Abraham, \"Your seed shall sojourn four hundred years in a strange land. I'll bring them out with a mighty hand.\" [Genesis 15:13] 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min\n\nL-65 And He was preparing a man for the job, as He was preparing an ark for a safety place for all who would believe. God put this bush on fire, and this sheepherder, Moses, said, \"I will just turn aside to see what this strange thing means.\" And when He got Moses up to the bush, He spoke to him. [Exodus 3:3]\n\nL-66 What was the attraction later in the Pilate's hall, when this sheepherder throwed down a stick and it turned into a serpent? God fulfilling His promise to Moses. What was the attraction at the Dead Sea, when Pharaoh's horses was all astonished, when they seen a wind come down from the heavens and part the Red Sea from right to left; and a poor bunch of slaves, walking in the duty of God, walk across that on dry land? What was it? God keeping His Word. The deadness moved away, a living people went across; and a spiritually dead people tried to impersonate it, and drowned. God fulfilling prophecy and making history. That was the attraction at the Dead Sea. [Exodus 4:1-4]\n\nL-67 What was the attraction the second day after that, at Mount Sinai, when all the people was commanded not to come at their wives, when they was asked to wash their clothes and sanctify themselves, and gather around a mountain where a man by the name of Moses had said he met God in a Pillar of Fire? And God had said to Moses, \"I'm going to come down amongst the people. I'm going to confirm that what I told you, and Who I am. I'm going to show them that I am that God.\" That was the attraction, God fulfilling His Word. [Exodus 3:8]\n\nL-68 What was the attraction one day in history, where a nation had forgot God, where the people had become formal and indifferent, where the priests had all went with the modern trend, the prophets prophesied according to the will of the priests? And in that day, as usual, they had one man that they thought was a fanatic. He talked about women wearing paint, and everything, and he was a kind of an odd sort of a guy. And this old fellow had come down and said to the king, \"Not even dew is going to call... come until I call for it.\" [I Kings 17:1]\n\nL-69 And we find out, then, that he had hid hisself and run away from it, and he hid out in the wilderness somewhere. The company had thought that maybe he had starved to death or perished; but he had been fed pretty well, and watered, too. And here he was, come down and said, \"Do you see that I have THUS SAITH THE LORD? Now, if you're not convinced yet, let's go up to the top of the mountain and prove who is God,\" for he had another vision from the Lord. [I Kings 17:2-16]\n\nL-70 He said, \"Choose you a--a altar, and make it, and--and choose ox and slay them. I'll make an altar of the Lord, and also I will put ox on mine. We'll both make a sacrifice, and let the God that's God answer.\" He'd a by no means done that if the Lord hadn't a told him; he said so later, \"I've done this at... all this, at Your command, Lord.\" [I Kings 18:23-24]\n\nL-71 But what's the attraction? It's got four hundred priests standing on the hill, and the king up there in his chariot, with all of his armors and guards standing around. And this old, wooly, fuzzy-faced- looking man, baldheaded, and hairs hanging down over his face, piece of sheepskin draped around him, and hairs all over his body, standing up there with a stick in his hand, and a cruse of oil in the other hand; that just said, three years and a half before that, \"Not even dew will fall till I call from it, for it,\" taking the place of God, with such things as halos and shadows, and all they talk about. \"And here that old fanatic standing up there on the hill, bringing all these people up there.\" What was that attraction? It was God fixing to vindicate His prophet to be right. It was God fulfilling prophecy. God also making history, fulfilling the Word. [I Kings 17:1]\n\nL-72 A few hundred years after that, there was a man anointed with that same Spirit, and he come out of the wilderness, not connected with any organizations; though his daddy was an organization man, a priest of an order. But he come out of the wilderness, dressed with a sheepskin around him, hair all over his face. Instead of being gray, it was black. What was this man's attraction that attracted all Jerusalem and Judea? Some of them going out and said, \"There's a wild man down there. He's trying to drown the people in water. Who ever heard of such a thing as that?\" [Malachi 3:1-1]\n\nL-73 Others were curious, and saying, \"This must be the Messiah.\" One of them said, \"It could be one of the prophets.\" They didn't know what to think. But what was it? It was God fulfilling Isaiah 40, where He said, \"Behold...\" what He would do in the last days, how He would send His servant and what he would do. [Isaiah 40:3]\n\nL-74 Then we find, a few weeks after that, that man being so positive of his message, till he said, \"There is One 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min standing in among you, Whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire, as I have baptized with water.\" [Matthew 3:11]\n\nL-75 One day an ordinary, young Man, about thirty years old, walked down and was baptized. And when this Man come, there was such an attraction by the prophet, the prophet act strange that day. The congregation couldn't help from watching the action of that prophet when he was debating with the priests across the river.\n\nL-76 They said, \"God built this altar. God told us to do this. Moses is the prophet. We believe Moses. The sacrifice will never be done away with.\"\n\nL-77 I can hear John answer back, said, \"Have not you read in the Scripture what Daniel the prophet said, 'The daily sacrifice will be done away with'? And that hour has arrived! Have not you read what Isaiah said in the 40th chapter, 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord'? There is two prophecies for me. And another thing, did not you recognize our prophet four hundred years ago, Malachi, when he spoke in the 3rd chapter and said, 'Behold, I send My messenger before My face, to prepare the way'? Don't you know this fulfills prophecy?\" Prophecy was being fulfilled! [Daniel 12:11], [Daniel 11:31], , [Malachi 3:1], [Isaiah 40:3]\n\nL-78 And about that time the prophet turned and said, \"Behold, there comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!\" Now what's the attraction? It's changed from the prophet to his prophecy. [John 1:29]\n\nL-79 Now notice what comes to pass. Here comes an ordinary Man, known of no one, a carpenter's son, come walking out in the water. When John, the great prophet, said, \"I have need to be baptized of Thee. Why comest Thou to me?\" [Matthew 3:14-15]\n\nL-80 He said, \"Suffer that to be so. But, as a prophet and the Word, it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness.\" [Matthew 3:14-15] So he understood the Sacrifice had to be washed before presented, and he baptized Him.\n\nL-81 Now there's another attraction takes place when He went up out of the water. This prophet who had been so loyal to declare his age and the time, he looked up and he saw the heavens open. He saw the Spirit of God, like a dove, descending upon Him, and a Voice saying, \"This is My beloved Son in Whom I'm well pleased.\" God was vindicating a prophet's message, what was attracting the attention at the Jordan. [Matthew 3:17]\n\nL-82 A brother sang a while ago, or he was supposed to sing, \"On the hills far away stood an old rugged cross.\" What's the attraction on Mount Calvary? When we see the religious world had condemned Him, and the Roman government had sentenced Him to death. And here He was hanging between two malefactors, starving for a drink, Blood running out of His body. There He hangs, crying, \"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\" And the religious people standing there, looking at it, little did they know that the prophecy of the Old Testament was being met right there at Calvary that time. [Matthew 27:46]\n\nL-83 David himself wrote, act... fell into the Spirit like all prophets, he act like it was him. David cried, in the 22nd Psalm, \"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me? All My bones they stare at Me. They pierced My hands and My feet.\" David, speaking like it was him. And it wasn't David, it was Christ in David. [Psalms 22:1, 7-8, 13-15, 17-19]\n\nL-84 And here the very prophecy that went forth, of all the different prophets, was being fulfilled on Mount Calvary. What's the attraction on Mount Calvary? God fulfilling His Word.\n\nL-85 Another attraction was on a mount, was on the Day of Pentecost, when all of them was up there in a religious feast, thought they had got rid of all the fanatics. They hadn't heard from them for ten days. All of a sudden, like a beehive, they broke out of the top of the building, out into the streets, a screaming and carrying on.\n\nL-86 \"What is this? What meaneth this? Are all these man drunk?\" [Acts 2:12-17]\n\nL-87 Watch! And a prophet stood up among them, as the order of a prophet should be, and said, \"Ye men of Israel, and you that dwell in Judaea, in Jerusalem, let this be known unto you, and hearken to my words. These are not drunk like you think they are. But this is that which was spoken of by the Lord through Joel, the prophet, 'It shall come to pass in the last days, I'll pour out My Spirit upon all flesh.'\" That was the attraction. [Joel 2:28-30] 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min\n\nL-88 The religious people, after crucifying the Prince of Life, and everything, still didn't see the promise of the coming of the Holy Spirit. The attraction, \"Who is this? What meaneth this? What's the matter with them people?\" [Matthew 21:9-11]\n\nL-89 Oh, my! It's the same today. We'll bypass a lot of this to bring it to this hour. The same thing is today. The same thing is taking place. The same question is asked. \"What's all that racket?\" Look up-and-down the street, cars from Michigan to Florida, from Maine to California. This morning when I was riding out, or right after noon, we was going down the street, wife and I was looking at licenses on cars. That's where I thought of this text. \"What meaneth this?\"\n\nL-90 Just as It said, \"Where the Carcase is, there the eagles will gather.\" [Matthew 24:28]\n\nL-91 I said to my wife, \"Honey, you remember the last night when I had to say good-bye to everything was dear to me on earth, and go into the fields to start something that God had said do? You sang that song.\" Oh, they'll come from the East and the West, They come from the lands afar, To feast with our King, to dine as His guest; How blessed these pilgrims are! Beholding His hallowed face Aglow with love Divine; Blest partakers of His grace, As gems in His crown will shine.\n\nL-92 That's what the attraction is. The predestinated Seed of God who can't do nothing else but follow It, means more than life to us. Take our lives, but you don't take That. What is the attraction? God, as usual, fulfilling His Word. He is fulfilling the Word of Zechariah again, of prophet Zechariah.\n\nL-93 Where I read the 9th verse a while ago, when Jesus entered His temple, riding... or entered Jerusalem, riding on a little, white donkey, the prophecy was fulfilled that Zechariah said. Here It is, \"Rejoice greatly, O daughters of Zion. Shout, O daughters of Jerusalem. Behold, thy King is coming unto thee; He is just, and having salvation; lowly, riding upon an ass, and upon the colt the foal of an ass.\" That's what the attraction was at Jerusalem, at the religious headquarters. [Zechariah 9:9]\n\nL-94 Now we see a last-day happening! Let's just turn a few pages on, in Zechariah, and see what he said about it. Let's turn it over then for the last days. That was the middle age; let's turn now to the last days. And turn over to Zechariah, the 14th chapter, and beginning with the 4th verse. And listen! And we're going to read down a portion of the Scripture, about nine verses, from 4 to 9. Listen close. And it's prophesying of His Coming, the last days. Listen close now. This is THUS SAITH THE LORD. It's the Scriptures, Zechariah 14. Remember Zechariah 9, what It said? And they didn't recognize It. Now what is it today? Zechariah 14, speaking of His Coming. And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, again, which is before Jerusalem on the east, on the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof towards the east and towards the west, and there shall be a very great valley; ... half of the mountain shall be moved towards the north, and half... towards the south. And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach from Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like you fled in the days of the earthquake in the days of Uzziah the king of Judah:... [Zechariah 14:4-5]\n\nL-95 Another earthquake splitting open the earth! If you want to follow out a Scripture here, notice in this 5th verse, it applies that the cleaving of the Mount of Olives is due to an earthquake, and this is confirmed by Isaiah 29:6 and Revelation 16:9. Exactly! What is it? The same prophet told of His first coming, seen His second Coming. Notice, \"As in the days of the earthquake.\" See what the earthquakes are doing? See the predictions of them? 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min ... and the LORD your God shall come, and all of his saints with thee. And it shall come to pass in that day, (hallelujah) in that day, that the light shall not be clear, or dark: But it shall be one day with... one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that in the evening time it shall be light. (O God!) [Isaiah 29:5], [Revelation 16:9], [Zechariah 14:7]\n\nL-96 \"It shall be Light about the evening time,\" same prophet. And the people is blind! What's the attraction? Let's read a couple more verses. And it shall be in that day, that the living waters shall go forth from Jerusalem; half of them towards the former sea, and half... towards the hinder sea: in the summer and... winter shall it be. (The Gospel going forth; both Jew and Gentile.) And the LORD shall be king over... the earth: in that day, and there shall be one LORD, and his name one. It shall be Light about the evening time, (right) The way to Glory you will surely find; In the water way is the Light today, Buried in the precious Name of Jesus. Young and old, repent of all your sins, The Holy Ghost will surely enter in; The evening Light has come, It is a fact that God and Christ are One. See where we're at? Nations are breaking, Israel's awakening, The signs that our prophets foretold; (that earthquake to the Gentiles to the last day) The Gentile days numbered, with harrows encumbered; Return, O dispersed, to your own.\n\nL-97 You that's been kicked out, and these arks carried on new carts, get out of there 'fore death strikes you. God has confirmed It. It shall be so.\n\nL-98 Let us turn over to another Scripture in the Old Testament, Malachi the 4th chapter, and read that little 4th chapter. ... behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea,... all that do wickedly, shall be as stubbles:... [Malachi 4:1]\n\nL-99 Now, this is not... That's Malachi 3, was the first coming, now here is the next coming. Even the Doctor Scofield here, I certainly don't agree with him in his footnotes, but he's got it lined out here right. \"The commission of John,\" to Malachi 3; and, \"The second Coming of Christ,\" and Elijah beforehands. All right. ... all the proud shall burn up, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall leave them neither root nor branch. (Where's the \"Eternal\" hell then?) [Malachi 4:1] But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness rise with healing campaigns, healing in his wings;... you shall go forth, and grow up; as calves of the stall. [Malachi 4:3] And you shall tread down the wicked;... they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in that day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts. [Malachi 4:4] Remember... the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded... him in Horeb for all Israel,... the statutes and judgment. [Malachi 4:3]\n\nL-100 Here is the coming of Elijah.Behold, I will send to you Elijah the prophet... [Malachi 4:5]\n\nL-101 The last closing Scripture of the Old Testament! ... I'll send to you Elijah the prophet before the coming of that great and dreadful day of the LORD: [Malachi 4:5] 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min\n\nL-102 Now, that couldn't a been John. No. See, the world wasn't burnt up and the righteous walked out on the wicked. See? No, no. ... before the great and dreadful day of the LORD: And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-103 Notice the accuracy of the Holy Spirit, that It would not confuse them two comings of Elijah. Malachi 3, said, \"Behold, I send My messenger before My face.\" Jesus was asked about John; He said, \"If you can receive it, this is who the prophet said, 'I'll send My messenger before My face.' This is the Elias that was to come.\" Malachi 3. [Matthew 11:14]\n\nL-104 Notice the Scripture so accurately gives it. Watch what this... to show the... them who wants to believe, them who wants to see. Remember, Jesus stopping in the middle of a Scripture, 'cause part of it was fulfilled then, the rest for His second Coming? \"To preach the acceptable year of the Lord, bind up the brokenhearted,\" and stopped; not \"bring judgment to the Gentile\" until His second Coming. [Luke 4:19], [Isaiah 61:2]\n\nL-105 Notice this Scripture here parallels that. \"And he, Elijah, shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children.\" (Now speaking of Malachi 4, not get it mixed, or Malachi 3.) John, Elijah, who came in the days before the first coming of Christ, turned the hearts of the old patriarch fathers to the message of the children, the new message. [Malachi 3:1]\n\nL-106 Now watch. \"And the hearts of the children to the fathers.\" In his second coming, in the last days, he turns back to the apostolic Faith again. See how perfect the Scriptures line up? [Malachi 4:5]\n\nL-107 That was the end of the Old Testament, the Old Testament. Now we see there's Light in the evening time. What is It? It's the top, Mount Treetop.\n\nL-108 As I said this morning, we've come up through denominations, through (not a orange tree) like I spoke of this morning, but we've had grapefruit, lemons, all kinds of other things that wasn't like the beginning at all. But after... Don't miss It. Here It comes. After all the denominations has played out, they didn't have any Light to begin with, there'll be a day that can't be called day or night.\n\nL-109 What are they doing? What are they doing? What does a--a lemon do on an orange tree? It takes the original life of the orange that's coming up and perverts it through a lemon. That's what the denominations has done to the Word of God, made the Word of God of no effect by their traditions. That's THUS SAITH THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD. They have brought forth lemons, grapefruits, not oranges.\n\nL-110 But what did the prophet say? The same one that said for our text tonight, \"Rejoice, O daughters of Jerusalem, shout loud, daughters of Zion, for your King is coming to you, meek and lowly, sitting upon the foal of an ass,\" notice that same prophet said, \"There'll come a time of the ripening.\" The sun is sent upon the earth to ripen the fruit. Why couldn't it ripen? There's no fruit there to ripen. But the Life is still traveling on.\n\nL-111 It come up through a grapefruit, to be an orange, found out it organized; it was a grapefruit. It went again, it come out that time a lemon. Went on again, it turned out to something else. And in the last, top of the tree, it's turned out to a tangelo, which is half orange, half lemon; a mixed breed, a perverted thing; come on to a perversion, living off that same tree; the shuck, \"almost deceive the Elected.\" Looks like an orange, but it ain't.\n\nL-112 \"But it shall be Light,\" when she grows beyond organization. When she gets out a-past organization, it blooms out again, she'll put forth oranges like she was when she went into the ground, and then it shall be Light.\n\nL-113 What's this attraction; what's this happening? Fulfilling God's Word. There is two witnesses of the Old Testament, that this would happen.\n\nL-114 Let's take John 14:12, of the New Testament, Jesus said. 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min ... He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also;... [John 14:12]\n\nL-115 Also, in Luke 17:22 to 30, He said. As it was in the days of Lot, before Sodom, was burned, so shall it be at the return of the Son of man, that day when the Son of man is being revealed.[Luke 17:22-30]\n\nL-116 Oh, just look at the Scriptures! \"The Son of man,\" Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, growed a-past denominations, growed into the top of the Tree. What did He say in John 14, or 15? \"Every branch that's in Me, that doesn't bring forth the fruit, it'll be cut off and pruned, throwed into the fire and burned. But every branch that'll bring forth fruit, it'll be purged.\" [John 15:2]\n\nL-117 Oh, there will be a true former and latter rain in the last days upon that little group that come with Him on this little donkey, low and humble, no don-... or denomination, crying, \"Hosanna to the King that comes in the Name of the Lord!\" What's the matter today? What's the attraction on the mount? [Matthew 21:9]\n\nL-118 Not long ago, standing at this pulpit, it was said by the Holy Spirit, \"The day will come that when they'll drive down a stake in front of your house; they'll move your gate. So, that, you'll bypass it, not be angry.\" I seen my gate tore up and laying out upon the hillside. I seen the hill in front of me, all dug up, boards and things laying there where something had mashed it up. He said... I looked, and there was a little Ricky that had got up there and knocked that gate out, done this. I said, \"Why didn't you tell me?\" He got smart with me, and I had to hit him. And when it did, I said, \"I haven't done this since I was in the ring, but I just want you to know,\" and I swatted him one. And when I knocked him down, I picked him up again and knocked him down again. I picked him up, three or four times, then kicked him over the hill. So then I went over there, and I said, \"That ain't right.\" And I picked him up and shook his hands, I said, \"I'm not angry with you, but I just want you to know you can't talk to me like that.\" And then when I turned and come back, the Holy Spirit was standing there at the gate, said, \"Now bypass this. When that stake is drove down, turn westward.\" This Book, everything that I need, This Book is a good Recipe, The way that shows to go around my trouble. Amen!\n\nL-119 And that Book is the Word, and that Word is God. Bypass your troubles, It'll tell you what to do.\n\nL-120 Three years ago I heard a friend of mine, the city surveyor, lives down the lane from me, driving a stake down. I went out there and said, \"What's the matter, Mud?\" Mr. King's son, personal friend. Said, \"Billy, they're going to widen this road.\"\n\nL-121 You all remember. I said, \"It may be the bridge.\" I told Brother Woods, I said, \"Hold your property. Maybe that bridge is going to come through up here, something.\" The lane was tore up; bricks, rocks, throwed all over everything. So he said... I said, \"Hold your property.\" Then when I... Mr. King told me that was going to happen.\n\nL-122 I went in, said to my wife sitting there, \"Honey, there is something written about that. It's THUS SAITH THE LORD, somewhere.\" I went in and got my book, looked into it, and it said, \"It shall come to pass...\" Eight years later! Then when I looked at it, I said, \"It's time now, honey, we must turn west.\"\n\nL-123 Two days after that, standing in the room about ten o'clock one morning, I went into the Spirit of God. I saw that little cluster of doves flying, looked at them little birds. You remember it. I seen seven Angels in the form of a pyramid, come rushing in to me. Said, \"Turn westward, go to Tucson, be forty miles northeast. And you'll be picking a cocklebur,\" or a bullheader, they call it there, \"off your clothes.\"\n\nL-124 Brother Fred Sothmann, sitting there looking at me right now, was there that morning. I had forgot about it.\n\nL-125 I said, \"A blast went off like an earthquake, that shook pretty near everything there was in the country. I don't see how a man could survive it.\" I was scared. I stood at Phoenix, you all listening in tonight bear me record. I preached on 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min the sermon, Sirs, What Time Is It? \"Where are we at?\" I went West. Many of you here got that tape, many of you here heard it said, year or more before it happened.\n\nL-126 I went West, wondering what was going to happen. One day I got a call from the Lord. I told my wife, I said, \"Honey, I'm... probably my work is over.\" I didn't know. I said, \"I... God, God is probably finished with me now and I'll be going Home. You go get with Billy, take the children. God will make a way for you, somehow. Go on and live true to God. See that the children get through school, raise them in the admonition of God.\" She said, \"Bill, you don't--you don't know that's true.\" I said, \"No. But a man couldn't survive that.\"\n\nL-127 One morning the Lord woke me up, said, \"Get up there in Sabino Canyon.\" I took a piece of paper and my Bible. The wife said, \"Where you going?\" I said, \"I don't know. I'll tell you when I come back.\"\n\nL-128 I went up in the canyon, climbed plumb up where the eagles was flying around. I was watching some deer standing there. I knelt down to pray, and raised up my hands, and a Sword struck my hand. I looked around. I thought, \"What's that? I'm not beside myself. Here is that Sword in my hand; bright, shiny, glistening in the sun.\" I said, \"Now, there's not people in miles of me, way up here in this canyon. Where could that come from?\" I heard a Voice, said, \"That's the King's Sword.\" I said, \"A king knights a man with a sword.\"\n\nL-129 He, the Voice, come back, said, \"Not a king's sword, but, 'The King's Sword,' the Word of the Lord.\" Said, \"Fear not. It's only the Third Pull. It's the vindication of your ministry.\"\n\nL-130 I was going hunting with a friend, not knowing what was going to happen. And someone called me, the one that criticized me about that picture of the Angel of the Lord, the one that took it. I had to go to Houston about his son, for he was going in the death row and was going to be killed in a few days. And he met me in there and throwed his arms around me, said, \"Think, the very man that I criticized comes to save my only son!\" The humane society give me what they call an oscar, or whatever you want to call it, for saving a life.\n\nL-131 Then we went back, I went up in the mountain to hunt. There, Brother Fred and I, one morning when I walked out, and I--I had already got my javelina, and I looked and seen the place where they went. I said, \"Brother Fred, go over on that mountain early in the morning now, about the break of day, and I'll get on the other one. I won't shoot at the hog, won't kill him. But if they start over this way, that herd, I'll shoot in front of them then run them back.\"\n\nL-132 Brother Fred went out there and there was no hogs. He waved at me and I seen. I went down in a canyon, some big chasms, the sun was just coming up. I come around the other side of the hill, not thinking nothing about the prophecies. Set down, waiting, resting; I thought, \"What happened to those hogs?\"\n\nL-133 I picked up my... Set down like Indians do, you know, cross-legged. I looked on my overall leg, and there was a bullheader. I picked it up. And I said, \"That's strange! Here I am, about forty miles northeast of Tucson. There's my little boy Joseph sitting there waiting for me.\" And as I started to look, I seen a herd of hogs come out about a thousand yards from me, up on a mountain, I throwed the bullheader down. I said, \"I'll get them. I'll go get Brother Fred, and I'll hang up a piece of paper to let know which way to go, on this ocotillo here, and we'll get Brother Fred.\"\n\nL-134 And I started up the mountain, running as hard as I could on the other side. All of a sudden, I thought somebody shot me. I never heard such a blast; it shook the whole country. And, when it did, standing before me was seven Angels in a cluster.\n\nL-135 I met Brother Fred and them, a little after. Said, \"What was it?\" I said, \"That was it.\" \"What are you going to do?\n\nL-136 \"Return home. For, THUS SAITH THE LORD, the seven mysteries that's been hid in the Bible all these years, these denominations and everything, God is going to open those seven mysteries to us in the Seven Seals.\" 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min\n\nL-137 There was that circle coming up from the earth, like a mist forming. When It did, It went plumb up into the mountain, begin to circle on westward, from the way It come. Science found It after a while, thirty miles high and twenty-five miles across, just exactly in the circle of the pyramid.\n\nL-138 And the other day, standing there, turned the picture to the right, and there is Jesus as He was in the Seven Church Ages, the white wig on, showing Supreme Deity. He's Alpha and Omega; He's the First and the Last; He is the Supreme Judge of all Eternity, standing there, confirm the Message of this hour. And there shall be Light about the evening time! What's it all about? What was it? [Zechariah 14:7]\n\nL-139 I went westward. Upon that same mountain, passing up with Banks Woods there, said, \"Throw up a rock. Say to Mr. Woods, 'THUS SAITH THE LORD, you'll see the Glory of God.'\"\n\nL-140 The very next day, standing there, a whirlwind came down and blasted the mountains out. Rocks cut the top of the trees off, about three or four feet above my head. Made three big blasts, and the brothers come running over. There was about fifteen man standing there, preachers and everything else. \"What was it?\" He said, \"What was it?\" I said, \"Judgment is striking the West Coast.\"\n\nL-141 About two days after that, the earthquake almost sunk Alaska. What is this Light up on Sunset Mountain in the Coronado Forest of Arizona? What is this strange thing that happened up there, that the people has been driving east from west, picking up the rocks that laid around there where It struck? And every one of them, every one rock, has three corners on it, that It tore off. (The three are One.) They're laying on desks, on paper weights, across the nation. What is this strange thing upon Sunset Mountain in the Coronado Forest?\n\nL-142 Junior Jackson listening in, you remember the dream he had that I interpreted, \"going towards the setting of the sun\"? And this happened on \"Sunset\" Mountain. It's the evening time, sunset time. The sunset Message through a setting of history, a setting of prophecy, rather, being fulfilled. And it shall be Light at the evening time, upon Sunset Mountain in the Coronado Forest, forty miles north of Tucson. Get on the map and see if Sunset Peak there. That's exactly where it happened. I never know it till the other day. [Zechariah 14:7]\n\nL-143 Everything that... That shall never die. It's constantly unrolling Itself. From the very thing happening, to the picture being Jesus standing looking at us; and now exactly on Sunset Mountain, and the sunset Light. The evening Light has come, God vindicating Himself. What is it? It is the facts that God and Christ are one. The \"white,\" how many seen it, the white wig upon Him, as we talked in Revelation 1? See, the Supreme Deity, Supreme Authority; no other voice, no other god, no other nothing! \"In Him dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily.\" The Angels Themselves was His wig. Amen. [Colossians 2:9]\n\nL-144 What's happened upon Mount Sunset? God confirming His Word. That's what all this noise is about. Notice, it's God fulfilling His promised Word again, of Revelations 10:1 to 7, \"And in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel's Message, the mystery of God should be finished.\" The hidden mystery of Revelations 10:1 to 7, the last Message to the last church age. Fulfills exactly, in this age, Saint Luke 17:30, \"The day when the Son of man shall be revealed.\"\n\nL-145 \"And there shall rise false prophets and false Christs, show great signs and wonders, insomuch it'd deceive the Elected if possible.\" The people still in doubt. And, as usual, the church is just as puzzled. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-146 And the science, all through Tucson yet, they're writing pieces and put in the paper. Way back over there on Mount Lemmon, them big cameras didn't see It rising up from where we was standing; drifting on towards the West, showing the time is over. It can't go but a little piece there; it's at the West Coast. Judgment struck just in the very way it went. Going right up over Phoenix and right on across, on to Prescott and across the mountains to the West Coast, right on up into... Where was they going? Right on up into Alaska, and she is thundering, heading right that way.\n\nL-147 And the observatories and all of them in Tucson are still asking, research of science trying to find out what it is. So high they can't be fog, mist, or nothing up there. \"What did it? Where is it at?\" They're just as puzzled of that supernatural Halo hanging yonder in the sky as they was when the Magis come in following a Star, saying, \"Where is He that's born King of the Jews?\" What was it? God fulfilling His Word, \"And there shall rise a star out of Jacob.\" 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min [Matthew 2:2], [Numbers 24:17]\n\nL-148 And the God of Heaven promised the evening time would have evening Lights. Three years ago this mystery was a prophecy, \"What time is it, Sir?\" But now it's history. It's passed. The promise is fulfilled. What time is it, sir, and what's this attraction? God fulfilling His Word! He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Let us pray.\n\nL-149 Dear God, I have held the people at length, much longer than I intended. I pray, God, that something was said or done that will cause people out everywhere to understand. And by seeing and understanding they might believe that Thou art the true Christ, and the Words that's being confirmed is the confirmation of His Word being perfect and being fulfilled in Its season.\n\nL-150 Now, Lord Jesus, from Your Own Words, You said that the world would be in a Sodom condition. We know that, we can look at it. And You said, in that day, \"As it was in Sodom.\" There was three messengers sent to the Gentile and Hebrew world. And one of them, which was God Himself, the Son of man, revealed Himself in a human form and performed a miracle, insomuch that told Abraham what Sarah was doing behind Him in the tent. [Luke 17:29-30]\n\nL-151 You said it would repeat again when the whole Gentile world would be in a Sodom condition. And we're here, Lord. Other prophecies confirming the same thing, of sending Elijah in the last days, the Spirit of Elijah upon the earth, to bring the hearts of the fathers, or, \"the children back to the fathers.\" And I pray, God, that this hour that You will confirm Your Word, that You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. Grant it, Father. They are all Yours. I pray that You'll grant these blessings and confirm what's been said, for the Glory of God. In the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. [Malachi 4:6]\n\nL-152 To speak a word, is a man; confirm a word, is God. To say something, is one thing; God to do it, is another thing. God don't need any interpreter; He does His Own interpretation.\n\nL-153 Now we're fixing to have a prayer line, to pray for the sick, God willing. And we know that there's no one, no man, no woman, no human being, no angel, that can heal you, for God has already did it. He made the preparation, the only thing you have to do is receive it.\n\nL-154 There's no man, no angel, no nothing, not even God Himself, can forgive you for your sins. It's already done. Jesus did that at the Cross. But it'll never prosper you, or anything, or profit you anything, until you accept it. See?\n\nL-155 The only thing can be done, is orders that's been give by God, for believers to lay hands on the sick. That's been through the ages they've done that, through revivals. And they've called it, \"God.\"\n\nL-156 Abraham seen many signs. But there come a time when Abraham saw his last sign, just before Sodom was burned, and that was God manifesting Himself in the form of a man. Do you believe that? Did Jesus say it would repeat? [Genesis 18:10-15]\n\nL-157 Now, how many in here... And out in radio, or out on the telephones across the nation, if you're still listening in, get ready now for prayer, be praying, and you that's got these handkerchiefs here. Now, I cannot tell God what to do. No, far be it from me even trying it. He is sovereign; He does what He wants to. I can only obey and only can say what He says.\n\nL-158 And now they're standing around the walls, they're packed in, is congested. I wonder if we could ask God on these words, \"What is this attraction?\" If God would move among us again (there may be strangers here), and move among us and show His blessed face among us, show His Spirit's here, show that He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, that every one of us (after these two strong Messages) could believe it to be so? Could you do it? All right. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-159 Instead of calling a prayer line, then; hot, congested, standing against the wall. I look around this way, to call my prayer line, you couldn't do it; look, standing there. Could I call it this way? Your sick, cots, everything else, laying; you couldn't do it. So sit where you are, and believe God. If you do have a prayer card, hold it, it'll be good. We'll get to you if you want to come through a line. But you don't have to come through a line. 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min\n\nL-160 That Mr. Shepherd, last Sunday night, never come through no line. I don't--I don't guess he had a prayer card. Is Mr. Shepherd here tonight? Where is he? Is he here? He's in the back. Did you have a prayer card, Mr. Shepherd? You didn't? He didn't. He's sitting right there again, tonight. That's a good place to be, Brother Shepherd.\n\nL-161 Not only you have to be there, but just have faith. For, remember, a little woman touched His garment and He felt it. And He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And the Hebrew letter, in the New Testament, said that He is the High Priest tonight that can be \"touched by the feeling of your infirmities.\" Do you believe that? Have faith then! Don't doubt It. Believe It, and it'll come to pass. You can have what you--what you've asked for, if you can believe It. But you got to believe It. Will you do it? Will all of you believe It? How many will believe It now? God bless you. [Hebrews 4:15], [Matthew 8:17]\n\nL-162 I don't know who is who. I don't know none of you. It's not my business to know any of you. It's God's business to know these things. But He will do it if you'll believe It. Will you believe It now?\n\nL-163 Now, Dear God, surely we're not a bunch of hybrid Christians, we shouldn't be, somebody that has to be petted and babied. You don't have that kind, Lord. You have rugged believers. The very Presence of God sets a man's heart on fire. Like Abraham, he believed God. You made Yourself known to him, then You appeared to him and performed a sign, and he believed You. You turned his body back to a young man, and also his wife, which, his wife was part of his own body. Then come forth the new child, the promised son.\n\nL-164 God, You promised that it'd be the same thing in this day. I pray that You'll confirm this Word. And we'll deal right on that one promise there, that it will be like it was in Sodom, just before Sodom was burnt and judgment struck Sodom, the Gentile world. So judgment is fixing to strike the Gentile world, and the Jews got three and a half more years through the period of Tribulation, Jacob's trouble, the continuing of the seventy weeks of Daniel. But, the Gentiles' are numbered, it's time to go. And You give that sign, and You said it would be again. Grant it, God. They're, we're in Your hands, do with us as You see fit. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-165 Now don't be nervous. What would it be if I was nervous? Now, I'm making a thing here that it has to depend on the sovereignty of God. But why do I do this? He said it would be. That settles it. And if He makes Hisself that, confirmed like that before you, well, can't you believe Him? Certainly. You just have faith now and believe.Let me just look around, see where the Holy Spirit will lead, what He'll do. I don't know what He'll do, that's up to Him. But if you'll just only have faith, only believe, \"All things are possible to them that believe.\" Do all of you believe that, raise up your hands and say, \"I do believe It.\" [Congregation says, \"I do believe It.\"--Ed.] With all my heart, I believe It. [Mark 9:23]\n\nL-166 Now three will be a confirmation, if He'll do it three straight times, to prove you that It's right. I don't care where you are, who you are, you just have faith and believe. Now, don't--don't stir around. This way.\n\nL-167 Lady, praying, I don't know you. Just set where you're at; you don't have to come. I don't know you, but you're holding a little girl in your hand, or in your lap. I'm a total stranger to you. And the little girl looks normal, she looks well. She's a pretty little girl, little red-headed girl. I looking here at her, she don't look like she's crippled or anything. I don't know what's wrong with her. It might not be for the child; it might be for you. But I just happened to see you sitting there with that child, and praying. I have to talk to you a minute, to catch your spirit, like Jesus said to the woman, \"Bring Me a drink,\" see, just to figure--figure out one person. Brother Bryant and them sitting here, I know these people sitting here. They may be needy, too, but you was a stranger. [John 4:7]\n\nL-168 Do you believe me to be God's prophet? Do you believe these things that you've heard tonight is the Truth? Now, if God will reveal to me something that you've done, or something you ought not have done, or something's wrong with you, or what your desire is, you'll know whether it's true or not. Won't you? And if He'll do that, will it confirm His Word that He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that Saint Luke 17:30 is being manifested? You believe It? [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-169 Now, the lady raised her hand that we're strangers. I don't know you, but I'm trying to contact her spirit, one person. There's so many of you pulling. Now, you believe This with all your heart. 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min Now, it is for the little girl. It's not you. You're nervous, but it ain't the nervousness that's bothering you. The great thing on your heart is that little girl. And you believe God can tell me what it is? You believe it? Would it help you, would you believe then? It's a brain injury. That right? Now put your hand on the little child's head; your hand.\n\nL-170 Dear God, You said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe. They'll lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\" The woman is a believer. Her hand is upon the child. May it recover. In the Name of Jesus Christ, I offer this prayer. Amen. [Mark 16:17-18]\n\nL-171 Now do you believe, all of you? If thou canst believe, all things are possible. Certainly!\n\nL-172 I know the lady sitting next to her, but she is so sincerely looking this way. I can't call her name, but I... If I look at her a minute, I would know. But I know the woman by looks, but I don't know what's your trouble. Do you believe I... God will let me know what your trouble is? Would you... Would it help you? Sugar diabetes. Now, if that's right, hold your hand. Certainly!\n\nL-173 Happened to be the lady laying... sitting next to you, has got the same thing. She's a stranger. The other lady is praying for somebody, a crippled child. You believe with all your heart, God would grant it.\n\nL-174 Somebody back in here. Man sitting over there, trying to get rid of smoking cigarettes. You believe God will take them away from you? All right. You believe? You can have it. I never seen the man in my life.\n\nL-175 Here is a man. See that dark shadow hanging over this man right here that's laying on a cot like, or a chair? He's dying. He is shadowed. He's got cancer. I don't know the man, never seen him. God knows all about you. That's the truth, sir. Do you believe God could tell me something about you? Would it help you to receive your healing? [The brother says, \"Yes, I do.\"--Ed.] You was brought here by a friend. But you're not from here, you're somewhere where there's a big body of water that people fishes at. [\"Yeah.\"] Yeah, Albany, Kentucky. [\"That's right.\"] That's right. Believe, and you can go back home, well. Believe that it's gone. If you'll believe It! You must believe It, and believe it's been done for you. You believe?\n\nL-176 You, from Tennessee, got a boy that's got asthma. Not here, but you believe that he'll be healed? Then take your handkerchief, your... in your hand there, to him. He'll be healed if you'll believe It.\n\nL-177 The lady crying, sitting across from Doctor Vayle there. She is shadowed, also, a dark shadow. I never seen the woman in my life, but she's got cancer. She'll die if something isn't done for her. Do you believe He'll heal you, lady? You can? You can have your healing, if you'll just believe.\n\nL-178 There's a little lady sitting right behind her with a handkerchief up over her mouth. She's also got ulcered stomach, sick. You been having passing-out spells, blinding, falling out. Somebody brought you here. You got female trouble. If you'll believe, you can go home, be well.\n\nL-179 You, young man, you're a stranger; sitting right here in front of me, looking at me. What are you, Puerto Rican or something? Yeah, what I meant,...?...! I'm a stranger to you. You know that; you're not even from my country. But you believe that God can give you the desire of your heart? If I'll tell you what your desire is, will you receive it? You're seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That is true. Receive the Holy Ghost, my brother. [John 20:22]\n\nL-180 Here is a colored man sitting way back here, got a burden on his heart. It's for his wife. She is not here, even. She's got trouble with her feet. You believe that He'll heal her? You do? You're a stranger here. You're from across the sea. You're from Jamaica. Do you believe God can tell me who you are? Mr. Brady. You believe? Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.\n\nL-181 This lady sitting right back over in this end, next to Mrs. Wright there, she's got a burden on her heart. She is praying for a daughter. She's up for an operation. You believe with all your heart, for her? She won't need it if you'll get her to believe It. I can't heal.\n\nL-182 Way back yonder in the nursery, I see the Spirit of the Lord, a Angel, a Light moving in the nursery. It's over a young woman, and she's got a spiritual trouble she's wondering about. Seems like I ought to know the woman, somehow, a young woman. She's also got a female disorder. Yes. Her name is Mrs. West, from Alabama, Mrs. David 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min West. Believe; God will grant it to you.\n\nL-183 \"It shall be Light, and in that day when the Son of man is being revealed.\" If that isn't Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, I don't know nothing about It. Do you believe That? All things are possible to them that believe. [Luke 17:30], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-184 Out upon the microphones across the land now, and in this tabernacle, how many of you will raise your hands and say, \"I am a believer\"? Now, you out there in the lands, everyone has got their hands up, here. And way out, in yonder somewhere across the nation, you got your hands up, no doubt. Now close your eyes, just drop your hands upon somebody near you. Take a hold of their hand. Lay it upon their shoulder. I got my hands on the handkerchiefs. Look what's been done today! Look what's done now. Beholding His hallowed face Aglow with love Divine; Blest partakers of His grace, As gems in His crown to shine. Now pray. Let's pray, everywhere.\n\nL-185 Dear God, the hour has arrived. What meaneth this? God fulfilling His Word! What's the attraction, Lord? It's God fulfilling His Word. What is this out across the nation, through the medium of a telephone, that hundreds of people have their hands laid on one another across the nation, from one coast to the other, from the North to the South, East to the West? Here sets people here from foreign countries, many of the states, Mexico, Canada, and we got our hands laid on one another. God fulfilling His Word!\n\nL-186 How is this that a person could stand here by the Holy Spirit and call a man like He did Simon Peter, \"Your name is Simon, you are the son of Jonas\"? \"Go get your husband and come here.\" \"I have no husband.\" \"Truly. You have five.\"\n\nL-187 She said, \"I know that Messiah is coming to do this, but Who are You?\"He said, \"I am He.\" [John 4:16-26]\n\nL-188 And You're the same yesterday, today, and forever. And You've promised, \"The works that I do shall ye do also. More than this shall you do, because I go to the Father.\" \"And, behold, in the last days I'll send to you the Elijah, the prophet, and he'll change the thoughts of the people, turn the hearts of the children back to the apostolic Teaching of the Bible.\" \"And it shall be Light about the evening time.\" [John 14:12], [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-189 Here we are, great God of Heaven! The hour is here! The hands are upon the people.\n\nL-190 Satan, you're defeated. You are a liar. And, as a servant of God, and as servants, we command that in the Name of Jesus Christ, that you obey the Word of God, and go out of the people, 'cause it's written, \"In My Name they shall cast out devils.\" [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-191 And all the people may be set free. Grant it, Dear God. You are the God of Heaven that defeated, that day with an attraction on Mount Calvary, all sickness and diseases and all the works of the Devil. You are God. And the people are healed by Your stripes. They are free. In the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nL-192 God, every handkerchief that's laying here, while the Spirit of God is present, while the anointing of Jesus Christ is upon the people, and the great signs that He promised are being fulfilled, and the earth is trembling, the earthquakes are happening, the great signs that He told, and the Scripture being fulfilled, and the evening Light shining. I lay my body across these handkerchiefs, representing this whole body of believers from East, West, North, and South; and say to the Devil, \"In the Name of Jesus Christ, leave every patient these are laid upon,\" to the honor and glory of the Word of God. In the Name of the Word of God, Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Amen.\n\nL-193 Now, quietly, sanely, soberly, and in your right minds, as believers, do you now believe and accept your healing from God Almighty, in the Name of Jesus Christ? If you do, hold up your hands. All out in the lands, hold up your hands out there. Every person in here, as far as I can see, had their hands up; inside, outside, against the windows, in 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min the doors, in the nurseries, and all around everywhere, people with their hands up. They accept It. Satan is defeated! The stripes of Jesus Christ heals you, and the Presence of Jesus Christ verifies the fact that He's a living today, ever able to keep every promise that He made. Amen! I believe Him. Don't you? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] [Isaiah 53:5]\n\nL-194 Now let us stand up to our feet. In the Name of the Lord Jesus, accepting everything that's been done or said, we love Him with all of our hearts. We cherish Him with all that's in us. Now as you go to your different homes from tonight, God go with you. God give you the Holy Ghost if you don't have the Holy Ghost.\n\nL-195 Every man, woman, boy, or girl, here, that's not been baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, there is clothes, pool. Don't put off tomorrow what can be done today. Tomorrow may be too late. \"Sufficient for today, for the day, is the evil thereof.\" There is ministers standing, waiting, clothes are waiting. No excuses. Are you waiting? If you are, you believe. No matter how you been baptized, sprinkled, poured, whatever it is, it's an error. The Light has come. Come, believe, and be baptized. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-196 Everyone without the Holy Ghost, may you receive the Holy Ghost, every one of you, in the full Divine power and love that He promised you, to make you a new creature in Him. God bless you.\n\nL-197 Now, till next Sunday morning at nine-thirty, let's sing this little song that we used to sing years ago. Don't forget the family prayer, Jesus wants to meet you there; He will take your every care, Don't forget the family prayer. Let's sing it together now. Don't forget the family prayer, Jesus wants to meet you there; He will take your every care, Oh, don't forget the family prayer.\n\nL-198 Now as we sing it again, shake hands with a pilgrim next to you, see, as we sing it. Don't forget the family prayer, Oh, Jesus wants to meet you there; He will take your every care, Oh, don't forget the family prayer.\n\nL-199 Don't you love Him? I love Him. I love Him because He first loved me and purchased my salvation (that was the attraction) on Mount Calvary. The same attraction on Sunset Mountain, Mount Nebo, Mount Sinai, all the different mountaintop experiences. Then, all right, let's sing it now. [Deuteronomy 34:1], [Exodus 19:18] I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And pur-... salvation On Calvary's tree.\n\nL-200 All that love Him, say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] So be it! Now just think of what He's done for you; think, that you could be out there in a barroom tonight. You probably would have been in the grave like I should have been, outside the mercies of God. What did He do for you? Oh, how could we keep from loving Him? Don't make any difference what anybody says, He is first.\n\nL-201 Let's close our eyes, and bow our heads as we sing it to Him now. He likes songs, singing hymns. Let's sing it to Him now. I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation 65-0725E, What Is The Attraction On The Mountain?, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min On Calvary's tree.\n\nL-202 With our heads and hearts bowed in His Presence, gratefulness for what our eyes has seen, what our ears have heard, what's recorded in God's Word, what His promise has been to us today. God bless you.\n\nL-203 We have a--a guest with us tonight, a brother, Ned Iverson, formerly a Presbyterian minister. His father, his brothers, are Presbyterian minister. He, I understand, was baptized today, again, in the Name of Jesus Christ. He's a minister, and a good one at that. And now I'm going to ask him, as I believe him to be God's servants, to ask God's blessings upon this congregation as you go to your home.\n\nL-204 Brother Iverson, come forward, while we have our heads bowed in prayer. God bless you, my brother. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

Let us speak to our Lord now. Great God, Creator of heavens and earth, Who has Divinely appointed us this time this morning, of worship to You. And may we, Lord, in our hearts surrender ourselves completely to Your Divine will and the working of the Holy Spirit in us, to bring forth that which You would have us to know. Our desire is to be better Christians and better representatives of You. Will You grant this to us this morning, as we wait upon Thee, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Be seated. [Someone says, \"You want to take off the prayer cloths?\"--Ed.] Yes.\n\nL-2 We are very happy to be here this morning again, in--in the service of the great King. And we're sorry, we, again, that we don't have the room for the people, but we have just... We'll try and make out the best we can, under the circumstances.\n\nL-3 Now, many has handkerchiefs and requests laying up here to be prayed over. And I'm just laying them to one side; not that I'm ignoring them, but I pray for them after I mainly... like, and tonight. I will this morning, and then tonight again, when... Then I'll pray and wait upon the Spirit of God for healing, and that's when I like to pray over the--the handkerchiefs and things. [Acts 19:12]\n\nL-4 And on the special requests, Billy gave them, every one, to me. There is about three hundred, and I just left the rooms then. You see, I'm just getting them just as fast, and every one, that I can get to. And I'll get to them just as quick as I possibly can. I won't be able to get them all. Just reach in and have to get one, say, \"Lord, and will it be this one, and be this one?\" Just like that, because they're, every one, needy, real requests; something, no doubt, that we should talk together about. And I... Less, you know, sometimes the Holy Spirit may say a certain one that I read, that keeps on my heart; I go back to that again, and hunt through there till I find it. Otherwise, just casually take them.\n\nL-5 Now, we also want to say, this morning, and greet those who are out in the other parts of the country. We want to greet the folks this morning by the way of this telephone hookup, to New York City; Beaumont, Texas; Prescott, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; San Jose, California; Connecticut; Gainesville, Georgia; and New Albany, Indiana; across the nation. We are greeting you in the Name of the Lord Jesus.\n\nL-6 This morning, in Indiana, it is a fair morning. We had a rain last night which cooled the weather. And we're... The tabernacle is packed out, and everybody is waiting, with great anticipations, for the Sunday school lesson. And I trust that the richest of God's blessings will be upon you out there.\n\nL-7 And we are hoping, soon as possible, to make a--a way that we can have, where we can bring all of us together, maybe under a big tent, where I'm feeling real definitely led to preach on these Seven last Vials in the Bible.\n\nL-8 So now, so that we won't be too long on a great lesson this morning... I have sought the Lord, thinking, \"What could I say?\" knowing that this may be our last service that we'll ever have. The Coming of the Lord is so close at hand!\n\nL-9 I see, after that prediction made in California, there is houses out there, and places, sinking at the rate of thirty inches a hour, timbers cracking and breaking in. And they don't know what's doing it. We are at the end. Hundred-thousand-dollar homes, sinking. I got big headlines in the paper, pictures, that I hope to bring tonight, as I want to speak on something on that tonight.\n\nL-10 And, then, tonight we have prayer for the sick. Come in this afternoon, five, six o'clock, or whenever it is. We're going to start early, I suppose, so the people can get away early, and receive your prayer cards. And we'll be praying for the sick tonight, the Lord willing.\n\nL-11 Now, after prayerfully thinking, \"What must I do?\" knowing that someday I must answer for what I say here... And I have decided, or felt led by the Holy Spirit to speak this morning on prophecy, to kind of inform us. See? It's something that we... If we're not informed, and anything happens just casually, we should know about this. The Holy Spirit has give it to us, to warn the people of the comings. You know, the Bible said, that, \"God will do nothing except 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min first He shows His servants, the prophets.\" And--and how that Jesus warned the people, what would take place; how the prophets warned the people, that would take place. And it behooves us now, in the great hour that we're living, to see what age we're living in, and what's happening, what's going to happen in this age. So one of these strange subjects that perhaps we've read many times, it fell upon my heart to--to speak to the people about it this morning. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-12 Now let us turn over in our Bibles to Matthew the 24th chapter and read a portion of the Word. [Brother Branham clears his throat--Ed.] Pardon me. As a way of--of getting a context for our text and subject.\n\nL-13 Now, remember we are going to teach this as a Bible class, slow. Get your pencils and paper. I've got many Scriptures written down here, that--that you might be able to put these down. Then go home and study them, for this is just like a Sunday school class, that we might know, and be warned and prepared for the hours that we're living in.\n\nL-14 In the Book of Saint Matthew. [Brother Branham clears his throat--Ed.] Pardon me. 24th verse... Or, 24th chapter, rather, beginning with the 15th verse, I wish to read a portion of His Word. And when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) Then let them which are in Judaea flee into the mountains: Let him which is on the housetop--housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day: For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there would be no flesh saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall rise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elected. Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chamber; believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered... [Matthew 24:15]\n\nL-15 Now, for a subject, I would like to take the 24th verse, to emphasize on this verse for our Sunday school lesson this morning. And listen close while I reread this, again.For there shall rise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elected. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-16 Now for a subject this morning, or a text, rather, I want to take: The Anointed Ones At The End Time. That's the subject that I wish to speak on, or the text: The Anointed Ones At The End Time.\n\nL-17 I believe that we are living in the end time. I think most anyone that... The Scripture reader, or even a--a believer, knows that we are now at the end of the history of the world. There will be no use of writing it, because there won't be anybody to read it. It's at the end of the time. Just when, I do not know. Just how long it will be, not even the Angels of Heaven knows that minute or hour. But we been told by the Lord Jesus, that, when these things that we see now begin to come to pass, then to lift up our heads for our redemption is drawing nigh. Now, what \"drawing nigh\" means, I do not know. May mean... [Luke 21:28], [Matthew 24:36, 42], [Mark 13:32]\n\nL-18 As the scientists said the other day, on the television, speaking of the great thousands-of-miles break in the earth that's going to sink. He was asked the question, \"It could sink there?\" That's Los Angeles, the West Coast. And many of you seen how they followed it with radar, and went up through... broke in below San Jose, went across over into Alaska, out through the Aleutian Islands, about two hundred miles out into the sea, and come back down into San 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min Diego, went around in behind Los Angeles, and come up there, a great pocket. And all these earthquakes we've been having is the volcanic hitting this great hollow dipper, like, in there. I can't call the name that they--they called it. However, when that shakes, that gives these earthquakes we been having for years on the West Coast. Now it's cracked all the way around. And the scientists said, one...\n\nL-19 The man said to the other, \"That could fall in?\" He said, \"Not 'could,' but it will.\" Said, \"But not in our generation, perhaps?\" Said, \"In the next five minutes, or the next five years. We don't know just when.\"\n\nL-20 This week, was sent me a headlines in the paper, of big hundred-thousand-dollar homes cricking and cracking, the people moving away. And they don't know how to stop it. There is no way to stop it. See, God can do whatever He wants to, and there's nobody can tell Him how to do it.\n\nL-21 You build homes, you can make scientific things, and God is the creator of science. How you going to stop Him? He can destroy the earth this morning by fleas if He wants to. You realize, He could speak fleas into existence, and they'd be forty miles deep in a half hour's time, see, there's no... and eat people right off the ground. He is God. He just does as He will. He is sovereign, in Himself.\n\nL-22 Now, seeing all this accumulation of evidence, that the hour that we now live in, I think it's a good thing to rehearse these things and to draw them out, since the Seals has been opened, and find out the truth of these things, as God has been so loyal to us, with His grace, to show us these things.\n\nL-23 I want you to notice here in Matthew 24, Jesus used the term of \"Christs,\" C-h-r-i-s-t-s, \"Christs.\" Not Christ, but \"Christs,\" plural, not singular. \"Christs.\" Therefore, the word Christ means \"the anointed One.\" And then if it's \"anointed,\" there will be not only one, but many, anointed, \"the anointed ones.\" See?\n\nL-24 Otherwise, if He wanted to break it down so we would more or less understand it better, He would say, \"In the last days there shall rise false, anointed ones.\" Now, that seems almost impossible, see, the terms of \"anointed.\" But notice the very next words, \"and false prophets,\" p-r-o-p-h-e-t-s, plural. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-25 Now, anointed one, is, \"one with a message.\" And the only way the message can be brought out is by one that's anointed, and that would be a prophet, anointed. \"There shall rise false, anointed teachers.\" A prophet teaches what his message is. Anointed teachers, but anointed people with false teaching. Anointed ones, \"Christs,\" plural; \"prophets,\" plural. And if there is such a thing as a--a Christ, singular, then these would have to be \"anointed ones,\" that their prophecy of what they were teaching would be the difference, because they are anointed ones, anointed. [II Peter 2:1]\n\nL-26 Now, it's a Sunday school lesson, we want to--to try to bring this to a real showdown, by the Scriptures, not by what someone else has said about it, but just reading the Scriptures. You may say, \"How can this be? Would the anointed ones...\"\n\nL-27 What were they? \"Christs,\" C-h-r-i-s-t-s, anointed. \"Christs, and false prophets.\" Anointed ones, but false prophets!Jesus said, that, \"The rain falls on the just and the unjust.\" [Matthew 5:45]\n\nL-28 Now, someone might say to me, \"Do you believe that that anointing on those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit?\" Yes, sir, the genuine Holy Spirit of God upon a person, and yet they are false.Now listen close and see what He said. \"And they shall show signs and wonders, insomuch that it would deceive the very Elected if it were possible.\" And they are anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit. I know this sounds very foolish, but we're going to take time and explain it by the Word, that that's absolutely THUS SAITH THE LORD, the Truth. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-29 Now let's turn in our Bibles, just a minute, to Matthew the 5th chapter, and begin with the--the 45th verse, and see now as we read for a few moments on these Scriptures. And then, after we get to here, why, we'll give you... So you, if we fail to read all of them, then you get your Bible; and--and also you can read them after we leave here and you go home, and--and you read what the Bible says about it.\n\nL-30 Now to take our time, to get a--a basic fact, because I'm making a statement here that's astounding. How can the 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min Holy Spirit anoint a false teacher? But that's what Jesus said would happen.Now, Matthew, the 5th chapter, the 45th verse, let's read now. Let's get, begin a--a little behind it, the 44th.But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you,... pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you;That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and... the good, and sendeth rain on the just and... the unjust. (The rain comes upon the evil the same as the good.) [Matthew 5:44-45]\n\nL-31 Now to follow this up, to another prophecy pertaining to this, may we turn now to Hebrews the 6th chapter, for the next follow-up verse on this, where Paul bringing back to mind the same thing that Jesus said. Paul, speaking now. While you're hunting it... And you out in the broadcast, get your Bibles near you and a piece of paper, and look up this now. Hebrews the 6th chapter, Paul writing to the Hebrews, showing them the shadows and the types, bringing them from under Judaism into Christianity, showing them that how all the old things just foreshadowed the things that was to come. Paul speaking now, Hebrews 6. Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ (C-h-r-i-s-t, singular), let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance... dead works, and of faith towards God.Of... doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. And this will we do, if God permits. For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,I want to call your attention just a minute. Did you notice, that's \"gift\"; and not \"gifts,\" partakers of \"the heavenly gifts\"? But, \"the heavenly gift,\" singular; \"Christ,\" singular; \"gift,\" singular.... heavenly gift, and... made partakers of the Holy Spirit, And have tasted of the... word of God,... (tasted of what?)... the word of God, and the power of the world to come, If they shall fall away, to renew themselves again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. For, (listen) the earth... drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, to bring forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessings from God:But that which beareth thorns... briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned. [Hebrews 6:1], [Hebrews 6:4, 6, 7, 8]\n\nL-32 Now compare that with Matthew 5:24 again. Notice, Jesus said the rain and the sun comes upon the earth, that God sends it to prepare the food and the things for the peoples of the earth. And the rain is sent for the food, the herbs. But the tarers, weeds, being in the field, receive the same thing. The same rain that makes the wheat grow is the same rain that makes the weeds grow. [Matthew 5:24, 45]\n\nL-33 How I had such a lesson on that one time, when I first met the Pentecostal people! And it was a great lesson to me. I seen two men, one... Never heard speaking in tongues before. One spoke in tongues, the other one interpret it, vice-versa. And would tell the truth, say that, \"There's many in here should repent tonight. There's women and man, both.\" And people would raise up and go to the altar. I thought, \"How glorious!\"\n\nL-34 And then with the little gift of the Holy Spirit, I talked to those man, just, you know how, in discernment, just a little way to find out. And one of them was a genuine Christian, and he was a real servant of Christ, and the other one was a hypocrite. And one of them, the one that was a hypocrite, was living with a black-headed woman, running around with a blond and had children by her. Well, it was right there in the vision; couldn't be denied. And I spoke to him about it. He looked at me and walked around the building.\n\nL-35 Now I was confused, sure enough. I thought I had come into angels, then I wondered if I wasn't among devils. How could this be? I could not understand it. And for years I kept my hands off of it, till one day where...George Smith, the boy that goes with my daughter, we went yesterday, up to the old mill place where I go to pray.And after being in there a couple days, the Holy Spirit brought this Scripture back to me. \"For the rain cometh oft upon the earth to dress 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min it with herbs, but thorns and thistles live by that same rain, and whose end is to be burned.\" Living by the same life-giving resource of God. Then I understood that. \"By...\" Jesus said, \"By their fruits they are known.\" [Hebrews 6:7-8], [Matthew 7:16]\n\nL-36 Now, therefore, the rain dropping down upon the natural vegetation of the earth, is a type of the Spiritual rain which gives Eternal Life, dropping down upon the Church, for we call it the former rain and the latter rain. And it's a rain, pouring out of God's Spirit, upon His Church.\n\nL-37 Notice, it's a very strange thing here. See? When them seed went in the ground, however they got there, they were thorns to begin with. But there the wheat that went in the ground, and the herbs, were herbs to begin with. And each herb producing itself, over again, showed that it was in the original beginning.\n\nL-38 \"And they will deceive the Elected if it were possible,\" 'cause they're getting the same rain, same blessing, showing the same signs, same wonders. See? \"They will deceive, or shall deceive the Elected if it were possible.\" Now, a thorn cannot help being a thorn, and neither can wheat help being a wheat; it's what the Creator of each one determined at the beginning. That's the Elected. The same rain! [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-39 The sun rises of a morning and spreads across the earth, as it had this earth and day that we live. And the sun, same sun that rises in the East is the same sun that sets in the West. And that sun is sent to ripen the grain upon the earth, which our bodies are made from.\n\nL-40 We are living by dead substance. That's the only way you can live. And if something has to die every day so you live, natural, then isn't it true that if your... Your body has to live by dead substance, for natural life, then you've got to have Something die, spiritually, to save your spiritual life. And God, became material, flesh, and died that we might live. There's no church, no other thing in the world can save you but God. That's the only thing that they live by.\n\nL-41 Now run the Scriptures. Jesus is the Word. \"In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was made flesh and dwelled among us. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. And the Word was made flesh, and Who lived, dwelled among us.\" \"And man shall not live by bread alone,\" for the physical, \"but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" Then, you see, we live by the Word, and that is God. [John 1:1], [John 1:14], [Matthew 4:4], [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-42 Now the sun comes across and ripens the grain. Now, it cannot ripen it all at once. As it goes on, maturing, it constantly ripens until it comes to a full ear. So is it, today, with the Church. It started in its infancy, back in the dark age, where it was under the ground. It's growed now into maturity. And we can see it, perfectly, how that God through nature always...\n\nL-43 You cannot disturb nature. That's what's the matter today. We're flying bombs, and out there in that ocean, breaking it and busting it around with atomic bombs. You're just breaking more of that dirt off all the time, dropping into it. You cut down the trees; storms will take you. Dam up the river; it'll overflow. You've got to find God's way of doing things and stay in it. We've denominated people in the churches and organizations; look what we got! Stay in God's provided way of it.\n\nL-44 But, you see, \"He sends the rain,\" back to our subject, \"on the just and the unjust.\" Jesus tells you here now, in Matthew 24, it would be a sign at the end time. Now, if this sign is only to be known at the end time, then it'll have to be after the opening of those Seals. See? It's a sign of the end. That would be, when these things happens, it'll be at the end time. And it'll be a sign, now, so the Elected will not be confused in these things. You see it? Then, it's got to be revealed, exposed. [Matthew 24:3-14]\n\nL-45 Notice, both the wheat and the weeds live by the same Anointing from Heaven. Both of them rejoice over It. I remember this, referring back to this instance up there that day at the Green's Mill. I--I seen that vision come up. And there was a great earth, and it had been all disced up. And there went a Sower forth, first. I want to keep that before you. Watch what goes forth first, then what follows it. And as this Man with white on came forth around the earth, sowing seed, then behind Him come a man, dark clothes on, looked very sneaking, slipping along behind Him, sowing weeds. And as this taken place, then I seen both crops come up. And as they come up, one was wheat and the other one was 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min weeds. And there come a drought, that when, looked like, both of them had their heads down just crying for rain. Then there come a great cloud over the earth, and it rained. And the wheat raised up and said, \"Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!\" And the weeds raised up and hollered, \"Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!\" Same results. Both of them perishing, both of them going away. And then the wheat comes up and gets thirsty. And because it was in the same field, the same garden, the same place, under the same spout, there come up wheat and there come up tarers by the very same thing. Notice, the same anointing water brings forth the wheat, brings forth the weed. [Hebrews 6:7]\n\nL-46 The same Holy Spirit that anoints the Church, that gives them desire to save souls, that gives them power to perform miracles, It falls on the unjust the same as the just. The very same Spirit! Now, you can't make it another way and understand Matthew 24:24. He said, \"There shall rise false Christs,\" false, anointed ones. Anointed with the genuine Thing, but be false prophets of It, false teachers of It. What would make a man want to be a false teacher of something that's Truth? Now we'll get down to the mark of the beast in a few minutes, and you'll see it's denomination. See? False teachers; false, anointed. Anointed Christs, but false teachers. It's the only way you can see it. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-47 Just like here some time ago, I have quoted this. I might quote it because we're hooked up across the nation. One day I was talking to a friend of mine, where this is coming in this morning, in Arizona. And he had a--a citrus farm. And he had a tree there which was an orange tree that was bearing grapefruits, and lemon, tangerine, tangelos. And I forget how many different fruits there was on that one tree. And I said to the--the--the man, I said, \"How is it? What kind of a tree is that?\" He said, \"The tree, itself, is an orange tree.\" I said, \"What has it got grapefruits on it? Why has it got lemons on it?\" He said, \"They are grafted into it.\" I said, \"I see. Well, now,\" I said, \"now, next year when that tree comes forth with another crop of fruit,\" which they all ripen about the same time, I said, \"then it will bring forth altogether oranges. If it's a navel orange tree, it'll bring forth the navel oranges, won't it, sir?\" He said, \"No, sir. Every grafted branch will bring forth of its kind.\" I said, \"You mean that lemon vine will bring forth a lemon out of that orange tree?\" He said, \"Yes, sir.\" \"Will the grapefruit bring forth a grapefruit out of that orange tree?\" He said, \"Yes, sir. That's the nature of the branch that's grafted into it.\" I said, \"Praise be to God!\" He said, \"What do you mean?\" I said, \"One more question. Now, will that orange tree ever bring forth oranges again?\" He said, \"When it puts forth another branch.\" When it puts forth another branch, not when one is grafted into it. But, they're all citrus fruit, and they live off of the citrus life that's in the citrus tree. [John 15:2, 4-5]\n\nL-48 I said, \"There you are! The Methodist will bring forth Methodists, every time. The Baptist will bring forth Baptists, every time. The Catholic will bring forth Catholic, every time. But the Church of the living God will produce Christ from the root, the Word every time, if it ever puts forth another vine of its Own.\"\n\nL-49 Now, you can graft it in there, you see. Every grapefruit, lemon, tangelo, tangerine, whatever the citrus fruits they are, every one of them can live in that tree; but bearing false witness of the tree, living by the tree. You see it? They are living and thriving on the genuine life that's in that tree. Now, there is Matthew 24:24, living by the same Life, but they wasn't right, at the beginning. They are bearing false witness of that Tree! It's an orange tree, yet it's a citrus tree. And they say, \"This church, this denomination is bearing record of Christ,\" and got a false baptism, false witness of the Word, trying to say that the power of God was only for the disciples. Jesus, Himself, said, \"Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every branch that'll ever... tree that'll ever bring 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min forth, ever branch that'll be in the tree. And these signs shall follow the genuine branches.\" Where? As long as it's a Tree, as long as It's putting forth branches, to the end of the world. \"In My Name they shall cast out devils; speak with new tongues; take up serpents; drink deadly things; lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.\" See the hour we're living? See what Jesus said? [Mark 16:15, 17]\n\nL-50 Remember, this was at the end time, not back under Wesley and back there. Now, at the end time, this was to take place. Now watch the Scriptures; let Them testify. Jesus said, \"Search the Scriptures, for in Them you think, or believe, that you have Eternal Life, and They are the Ones that testify of Me.\" In other words, if this tree ever brings forth a branch... \"I am the Vine, the Tree; ye are the branches. He that believeth in Me, the works that I do shall he do also,\" Saint John 14:12. [John 5:39], [John 15:5], [John 14:12]\n\nL-51 Now, \"He that abideth in Me, he that... him that was in My root at the beginning.\" That's the reason Jesus was both the Root and Offspring of David. He was before David, in David, and after David, both Root and Offspring of David; the Morning Star, the Rose of Sharon, the Lily of the Valley, Alpha and Omega; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. \"In Him dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily.\" Both Root and Offspring of David! \"He that is the elected Life, the predestinated Life, that's in Me,\" and He is the Word, \"from the beginning; when he comes forth, he'll bear My fruits.\" Saint John 14:12. But others will live by the same thing, calling themselves Christians and believers. \"Not all that saith, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter in.\" Now, and this is to take place and be manifested in the last days, \"when the mysteries of God should be finished,\" as we'll get to a little later. [Revelation 22:16], [Song of Solomon 2:1], [Colossians 2:9], [Matthew 7:21], [Revelation 10:7], [John 14:12], [Matthew 7:21]\n\nL-52 These trees, the true vine and false vine! You've heard me preach on that since, from years ago, how they've growed up together. Brought them in individuals and showed that, from Cain and Abel, the two vines that met at an altar; both of them religious, both of them anointed, both of them desiring life, and worshiping the same God. And one was rejected and the other received. And the only way that the one that was received could have done anything different from his brother, it was revealed to him. For the Bible said, \"By faith...\" Hebrews, 11th chapter, \"By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain, which God testified that he was righteous.\" Jesus, said, the spiritual revelation of Who He was! \"Who does man say I the Son of man am?\" He said, Peter said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" \"Blessed art thou, Simon--Simon, son of Jonas; flesh and blood never revealed this to you. My Father which is in Heaven has revealed it. Upon this rock I'll build My Church,\" (what?) the true revelation of the Word. There is the true Vine again. \"Abel, by faith!\" You said, \"It wasn't a revelation.\" [Hebrews 11:4], [Matthew 16:15-18], [Matthew 16:13]\n\nL-53 What is faith? Faith is something that's revealed to you; that is not yet, but you believe it will be. Faith is a revelation of the will of God. So, by revelation!\n\nL-54 And the churches today don't even believe in spiritual revelation. They believe in a dogmatic teaching of some system. \"By revelation Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain, which God testified he was righteous.\" Amen. I hope you see that. See where we're living? See the hour? I was talking to a--a gentleman not long ago, a Christian scholar and gentleman. He said, \"Mr. Branham, we refuse all revelations.\" [Hebrews 11:4]\n\nL-55 I said, \"Then you have to refuse Jesus Christ, for He is the revelation of God, God revealed in human flesh.\" Unless you see it, you're lost. Jesus said, \"Except you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.\" He is the revelation of God, the Spirit of God revealed in human form. If you can't believe that, you're lost. You put Him a third person, second person, or any other person besides God, you're lost. \"Except you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.\" A revelation! [John 8:24] 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min\n\nL-56 No wonder they couldn't see Him. \"No man can come to Me except My Father draws him. And all the Father has given to Me,\" in the roots, \"will come to Me.\" See? You get it? Oh, how we should love Him, adore Him, praise Him; to see the fruit of the Spirit in the last days, and the Bride Tree ripening in the top of the time! [John 6:44]\n\nL-57 The true vine and the false vine, both had the same anointing. The water fell on both of them. No wonder He warned us, \"It would deceive the very Elected if it was possible.\" [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-58 Notice, they look the same. They're anointed the same. But notice, \"By their fruit...\" How do you knowed it? How you know that isn't an orange? Because it's bearing a grapefruit. That vine is all right, it's living in the tree, but it's bearing a grapefruit. It isn't like the first one. And if a church says they \"believe Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever,\" and deny His Power, deny His works, deny His Word; if--if... The Church that believes in Jesus Christ, will do the works of Jesus Christ, it'll have the Life of Jesus Christ. And if it isn't, no matter if the Life is pouring into it; if it isn't predestinated, from the roots, it'll bear grapefruit every time, or something different. But if it's the predestinated Life, in the roots, it'll bear Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, if it's the Word coming up through the Root. Which, He is the Root, the beginning of time. , [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-59 Notice, but it's what they produce that tells you the difference. \"By their fruit,\" Jesus said, \"you shall know them.\" \"Man does not gather grapes off of a thistle,\" even though the thistle be right in the grapevine. That could be possible, but the fruit will tell it. What is the fruit? The Word, for the fruit for the season. That's what it is, their teaching. The teaching of what? The teaching of the season, what time it is. Man's doctrine, denominational doctrine, but, or God's Word for the season? Now, the time gets away so quick, that we could bear on that a long time. But I'm sure that you here present, and I'm sure you across the nation, can see what I'm trying to tell you, for we don't have too much longer to stay on it. [Matthew 12:33], [Matthew 7:16, 17]\n\nL-60 But you might see that the Anointing gets on the unjust, the false teachers, and causes them to do exactly what God told them not to do; but they'll do it, anyhow. Why? They cannot help it. How can a thistle be anything else but a thistle? No matter how much good rain is sprinkled on it, it's got to be a thistle. That's the reason Jesus said, \"They'll be so close it would deceive the very Elected,\" which is in the roots, \"if it were possible,\" but it ain't possible. A wheat can do nothing but bear wheat; that's all it can bear. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-61 Notice. Remember, God is not the author of organization. The Devil is the author of organization. I've proved that by the Word, back and forth, and over and over; won't have to go into that this morning. We know that God never did organize people together like that, make a organization. Hundreds of years after the death of the last disciple, 'fore they ever had the first organization. It's always proved a failure. If it isn't, why ain't we together in love today, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Catholic and all? Why ain't the works of God following us, then, every church on the same thing, the Word? Those things that separate man, brotherhood... We're farther from God than we ever was, the churches, speaking of.\n\nL-62 Now, we're told, that, \"All the old things happened for examples, for our teaching, reproofs, admonitions.\" That, all the old things of the Old Testament happened, foreshadowed, to see what would be in the New Testament, in our day. [Ephesians 6:3], [II Timothy 3:16] Just like if you had never seen your hand, and you looked up and you seen a shadow on the wall, as my hand would be from the light, if it's got five fingers here in a shadow, when the negative; and you move your hands towards, being the positive, towards the--towards the negative, it's got to come to five fingers. As the Bible tells us, that, \"The Old Testament being a shadow, type of the new things, or the things that was to come; not the very things that is, but it is a shadow, a type of the things that is to come.\" [Colossians 2:16-18], [Hebrews 10:1]\n\nL-63 Let us go back and see if this thing ever was in any other age. Are you willing? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] So we'll know, to prove this, back and forth, by the Word; not by some man's idea, some theory. I don't care who he is; any other man, myself or anybody else, \"If he speaks not according to the law and the prophets, 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min there is no Light in him.\" See? That's what the Bible said. \"Let every man's word be a lie, and Mine be true,\" regardless who it is. [Romans 3:4]\n\nL-64 Now let's go back and find out if this ever happened, to show us an example. We could go back over now in the Book of Exodus and speak of a character named Moses, who was an anointed prophet sent of God, with the Word of God and the will of God for his generation. As God's Word always runs in continuity, He said, \"He did nothing until He revealed It to His prophets first.\" Then He done it. See? Now, He cannot lie. He can't lie and be God. No, sir. He has got to remain true. There's not a lie in Him. He's... And He cannot change It. If He does, then He's not God; He made a mistake. He's got to be infinite. And infinite cannot make a mistake. See? So what God ever says, that's Eternally right. See? And He promised that. So, watch, there's nowhere in the Bible lest it follows continuity right to it. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-65 Now, God had promised Abraham that his seed would be a stranger in a--in a strange land for four hundred years, then He'd bring him out with a great hand of might and power, show His signs and wonders amongst the people that they dwelt with. The time of the promise drew nigh. People had forgot about it. They had Pharisees and Sadducees, and so forth, denominations. But, all of a sudden, there come God alone and drawed from, out, away from any of them. God never, in any day or at any time, ever called a prophet out of a denomination. No, sir. He's so twisted up, he couldn't do it; he'd have to stay with that denomination.\n\nL-66 Moses, a man sent from God, with the Word of God, and on his journey taking Israel into the promised land, strictly with the commandment of God, he met another prophet, another anointed one that had a genuine anointing of the same Holy Spirit that was upon Moses. That's right. He was a prophet. The Holy Spirit was upon this man. His name was Balaam. We're all acquainted with him. Well, the very things, the same, the things--the things that the man said, is still taking place, about twenty-eight hundred years ago. \"Thou art like a unicorn, O Israel. Whoever blesses you will be blessed. Whoever curses you will be cursed. Your strength, and mighty, how righteous are thy tents, O Jacob!\" See, he couldn't help himself. He come there purposing in his heart to curse the people. [Numbers 24:5]\n\nL-67 Oh, you false teachers listening to these tapes all these years, and seeing God confirm exactly what He said, and you set in your study and know it's the Truth; and because of your denominational differences, you dispute them and tell your people they're not so. Woe unto you! Your time is close at hand.\n\nL-68 Balaam, anointed with the same Spirit that was upon Moses. What was the difference? The teaching of Moses was perfect. The Bible said here in Second Peter, that it was \"the teaching of Balaam\" that Israel received, that God never did forgive. Unpardonable sin! Not a one of them got saved, though they had come out under the blessings of God, and seen the hand of God moving by this mighty prophet, and seen it exactly vindicated by God. And, because, another prophet come in with a teaching, contrary, and disputed with Moses, and tried to prove to the people that Moses was wrong. And Dathan, Korah, and many of them, agreed with him and taught the children of Israel to commit fornications, to go after his organization, that, \"We're all the same.\" \"Whether we're Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, or Pentecostals, and whatmore, we're all the same.\" [II Peter 2:10-15]\n\nL-69 We are not the same! Ye are a separated people, holy unto the Lord, dedicated to the Word and the Spirit of God, to bear fruit of His promise of this day. And you're not of them! I know that's awful strong, but that's the Truth just the same. Dedicated to a service in this last days! \"Come out from amongst it.\"\n\nL-70 Now, \"the teaching of Balaam,\" not the prophecy of Balaam. That was all right. That was God. How many believes that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] The prophecy of Balaam was exactly right, 'cause He couldn't speak nothing else. The anointing of God wouldn't speak nothing else, and God vindicated it by proving it was the Truth. But it was \"the teaching of Balaam.\" [Jude 1:11], [Numbers 23:12-20], [Revelation 2:14]\n\nL-71 Now compare that with Matthew 24:24. Anointed ones, but their teaching is false. The trinities, and all things like that; wrong, antichrist! I hope your feelings don't get hurt. And don't turn that, them phones off. And don't get up and go out. Just set still, and let's see if the Holy Spirit won't reveal it to us, and prove it to us. You say, \"But that...\" Just whatever you believe, just 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min set still and listen. And ask God to open your heart, then you'll find out whether you're a briar, or a thistle, or wherever you're standing. See? [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-72 Now, even Judas, \"foreordained to the condemnation he was,\" set there before Jesus. And Jesus told him, \"You are the one. Whatever you're going to do, and whatever you've got to do, go do it quickly.\" Him knowing what he was doing, but, for them thirty pieces of silver, and popularity, sold the Lord Jesus Christ. One of His disciples, the treasurer of the church, Jesus called him His \"friend.\" See? The Bible said, \"He was born the son of perdition,\" just the same as Jesus was born the Son of God. \"Deceive the very Elected if it were possible.\" [John 13:27], [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-73 Notice closely as we study on. We'll take another instance, over in the Book of Kings. There was a--a prophet, and his name was Micaiah. He was the son of Imlah, and he was a prophet. He was. And there was another prophet, the head of a organization of prophets, anointed ones. The Bible said they were \"prophets,\" just the same as He said Balaam was a prophet, anointed ones. And there was one of them by the name of Micaiah, who was anointed with God and sent by God, with the Word of God. There was one, Zedekiah, who thought he was sent by God. He was anointed of God, but his teaching was contrary to the Word of God. \"Rise, false Christs, show great signs, would deceive the Elected if possible.\" [I Kings 22:7-8], [Jeremiah 29:21], [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-74 Notice, both of them, both of them anointed. Now, how could you tell which was right, and wrong? Watch what the Word promised to Ahab. The prophet which was before him, which was Elijah, one of the greatest prophets of the age, that was a vindicated prophet. That vindicated prophet said, that, \"Because Ahab had done this evil, that the dogs would lick his blood; tooking Naboth's life. And that the dogs would eat Jezebel, and the... her body would be dung upon the fields.\" Now, how can you bless what God has cursed? Or how can you curse, as Balaam said, what God has blessed? See? But these prophets were sincere. There were no doubt but what they were good man, honorable man. For, to be a prophet in Israel, you must be honorable, or to even be an Israelite. You was stoned, if not. They were honorable man. They were smart man. They were educated man. They were the selected of Ahab, of the nation. (See that, Sister Wright?) The selected of the nation, well fitted for the par-... [I Kings 21:19, 23]\n\nL-75 And now, when Micaiah saw his vision, he knowed in his heart what the Word had said, but he wanted to see what the Spirit was in him would say. So they told him, they said, \"You say the same thing these other prophets say. And when you do, why, you'll be, we'll take you into the fellowship, no doubt, again. See? We'll make you one of us. We'll take you back into the denomination of us. You're... We know you're a prophet, but you're always saying cursing things. You're always cursing Ahab. Now, Zedekiah, the chief man, the pope, or the...\" whatever he was. \"Now he has blessed Ahab, and said, 'Go do it.' Now you say the same thing, Imlah. Why, you're just a poor guy. You ain't got no congregation, hardly, at all. And these guys has got millions. The whole nation is for them. Now you say the same as they do, see what you'll do, you'll--you eat the rich of the land.\" He's talking to the wrong man there! [II Chronicles 18:12]\n\nL-76 What if it had been said, \"Can you find any fault in Zedekiah, Micaiah?\" \"No.\" \"Did you ever catch him in sin?\" \"Nope.\" \"Did you ever hear him cuss anybody?\" \"Nope.\" \"Did you ever catch him drunk?\" \"Nope.\" \"Can you dispute his education?\" \"Nope.\" \"Do you believe his doctor's degree is false?\" \"Nope.\" \"You believe his--his Ph.D. is alright?\" \"Sure. By the Sanhedrin council; I guess it's all council, I guess it's alright.\" \"Well, then, why don't you join with him?\" \"Because he's off of the Word!\"\n\nL-77 Well, we'll have a showdown of it, then, like Elijah the prophet before that. And if you're a child of God, you'll stay with the prophet of this Bible. It's the Word. Notice the hour, the season.\n\nL-78 Well, what if Zedekiah say, \"Oh, I know the prophet said that, but that's for a future generation. That's for a long time from now\"? He said, \"Wait till I see a vision from God, and then I'll tell you.\" 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min Said, \"Then you say the same thing? He said, \"I'll say just what God says; nothing else, nothing more. I can't add one word to It, or take one Word from It.\" So that night, in prayer, the Lord came to him in a vision. He went out the next morning, he said... There is two prophets! [Deuteronomy 4:2]\n\nL-79 The greatest man in the nation, in the military and national sight, was Zedekiah. He was the head prophet, by the king. He was the head of all the other prophets, by organization. He was made, by his organization, the head of all of them; probably the best read, the best educated, more eligible for the job. And he was anointed with the Holy Spirit, for he's called a \"prophet.\" Sure, not just an ordinary prophet, he was a Hebrew prophet. Now watch him.\n\nL-80 Zedekiah said, \"The Lord spoke to me, 'Make Me these two horns of iron,' a symbol.\" A prophet usually gives symbols. \"He said, 'Make these horns of iron.' The Holy Spirit said to me, 'Take these,' the Anointing that blessed me.\" Don't think it as a sacrificial, but to get in a point. \"The Holy Spirit that speaks in tongues through me, the One that's vindicated me, He said, 'Take these horns, and, by this, tell the king that he'll push Syria plumb out of the country. And I will give him back the land that rightly belongs to Israel, the church.'\" Brother, that's pretty fundamental, just about like Balaam was up here. Balaam was just as fundamentally speaking as Moses was. Moses... The correct number of God is seven. And Balaam said, \"Build me seven altars; seven clean sacrifices, oxs, and seven rams.\" That's speaking of the coming of the Son of God. Fundamentally, he was just as right as any of them. [II Chronicles 18:10], [Numbers 23:1], [I Kings 22:11]\n\nL-81 And here is Zedekiah, just as fundamentally right, \"For this land belongs to us. Why, them Syrians and Philistines over there filling their bellies, of their children and so forth, our enemy, with the food that our children does without! When, God gave us this land!\" Brother, that's a good argument. I guess he could scream that out before Israel, and they could shout as hard as they could. Now, I'm talking about today now. I hope you're following me. All the screaming, hollering!\n\nL-82 You remember David last Sunday? See? You out there in radio land, or the land of this telephone hook-up; you didn't get last Sunday's Message, be sure to get it. Trying To Do God A Service Without Being Ordained To Do It, no matter how sincere, good, it's absolutely not received by God. See? Now, here was Zedekiah, thinking he's right.\n\nL-83 Micaiah said, \"Let me ask God.\" So he come down the next morning with THUS SAITH THE LORD. He checked his vision with the Word.\n\nL-84 Now if he would have said to Zedekiah, \"Do you know what the prophet of the Bible here said would happen to this guy?\"\n\nL-85 \"But not at this time, because this man is a honorable man. He is trying.\" Don't fail to get this. \"He is trying to give back to the church the things that belongs to the church. He is trying to give its property back,\" not the Spiritual things; if it would, he would have shook that whole nation like Elijah did. But, trying to give them the material things, \"We own property. We're a great organization. We belong to it. We all, all you people, you Protestants, should all join with us.\" Uh-huh. We're coming to that in a little bit. \"It's all brothers and sisters, anyhow.\" It isn't! Never was and never will be, with the real genuine Church of God. Can't be!\n\nL-86 Notice, he saw the vision. And so he said, \"God spoke to me.\" Now, look, the man was sincere. He said, \"He said, 'Make these horns, and go up there before the king and push westward,'\" or whichever the way the land laid from where they were standing. \"'Push, and that'll be THUS SAITH THE LORD, that he's going to win the victory and come back, a victory for the church.' Going to drive them out!\" That's pretty close, isn't it? What was the matter? Here come Micaiah down. Said, \"Now you give your prophesy.\"\n\nL-87 Said, \"Go on up! But I seen Israel like sheep, scattered, having no shepherd.\" Whew! Exactly vice versa. [I Kings 22:17]\n\nL-88 Now, you're the congregation. Now which one is right? Both of them, prophets. The only way you can tell the 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min difference in them, is, check it by the Word. Said, \"How do you get this?\" He said, \"I saw God setting upon a Throne.\" Said, \"I saw all the council around Him.\" [Revelation 7:10]\n\nL-89 Now remember, Zedekiah just said he saw God, too, and the same Spirit. \"I saw God. He told me to make these horns out of--out of iron. Go out there and push the nations out of here, for this belongs to us. The others ain't got no right into it.\" They would if they'd stayed right with God. They would have had that, but they got away from God. [II Chronicles 18:8-10] That's the way the organization is, the church. It's got a right to these things, but you have been cheated out of it, because you got away from God's Word and God's Spirit, anointing, to vindicate the Word of the season. Don't you fail to get this Message.\n\nL-90 Notice what taken place now. He said, \"I saw God,\" Micaiah did, \"setting upon the Throne in Heaven. His council was gathered around Him. He said, 'Who can we get to go down and deceive Ahab, to make Elijah's words come true; My prophet that was vindicated. I spoke that he would come. And Elijah had My Word. And heavens and earth will pass away, but My Word will not fail. I don't care how modern they get, or how good they get, or how educated they get, or how big they are, My Words will never fail.' \"And a lying spirit come up out of hell, fell down upon his knees, and said, 'If You'll just permit me, I can give them my anointing, make them do any kind of a sign or wonder, just long as I get them off the Word. He won't even know that That is Your Word. He'll ignore It, for popularity.'\" Brother, times hasn't changed. Brother Neville, that's true. You remember, that's true. \"'I'll get upon him, make him do the same things the rest of them does. I'll make him prophesy, and tell a lie.'\" How could it be a lie? Because it was contrary to the Word. [Matthew 24:35], [Luke 21:33], [II Chronicles 18:20-22]\n\nL-91 You take any of these false baptisms, false so-and-so-and-so's, I don't care how real it sounds, how much they try to impersonate, it's a lie if it's contrary to God's Word of this hour. That's exactly. You say, \"Well, ours, well, we did this, and we do this, and our church is this way and that.\" I don't care what it is. If it's contrary to the written Word for this hour, it's a lie. God will have nothing to do with it, no matter how sincere, how educated, how smart, how true it sounds, how reasonable it sounds, if it's contrary to the Word of this hour. We'll get into that a little deeper in a few minutes, time permits us. If we don't, we'll take it up again tonight.\n\nL-92 Notice, he was sincere, good man, no doubt. And he said... Then, otherwise, Micaiah said to him, not right out to his face, but other words, \"You're anointed with a lying spirit.\" Wouldn't that be something to tell a bishop? But he done it.\n\nL-93 And so this bishop walked up and said, \"You'll never have fellowship no more,\" and smacked him in the face. Said, \"You know that I'm a vindicated man. My church made me the head of it, this thing. The popular vote of God's people made me this. My organization made me this. And God gave us this land, and He intends for it to belong to us. And I have THUS SAITH THE LORD.\" Smacked him, and said, \"Which way the Spirit of God go when It left me?\" [II Chronicles 18:23]\n\nL-94 Micaiah said, \"You'll find out, one of these days,\" when California is beneath the sea out yonder, and all these things. See? \"You'll see which a way It went, when you're setting in the inner prisons.\"\n\nL-95 Now, Ahab, what are you going to say? \"I believe my prophet,\" he said. What if he just searched the Word? See, he didn't want to see himself cursed. Hear me! He didn't want to see himself cursed. No man does. And my organiza-... organizational brother, that's what's the matter with you. You want to think that you're right, when, you know in your heart, when you baptize using the name of \"Father, Son, Holy Ghost,\" you are lying. You know when you predi-... say those things that you're doing, and take initial evidences, and all things like that, you're wrong. How can the initial evidence be speaking in tongues, and then talk contrary to a promise of God in this hour? How can it be? You don't want the curse, do you? But Here it's written, so shall it be. That's the mark of the beast, so close it would deceive the Elected if it were possible. [Matthew 24:24] 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min\n\nL-96 Every sign, every wonder, anointed man, prophecy, all kind of things going forth; all kinds of signs, all kinds of wonders, how you going to tell the difference? Watch the Word for this hour. That's how you take...\n\nL-97 Watch Moses, how he could have told Balaam. Watch Micaiah here, how did we know he was right? The Word, before him, had prophesied that for Ahab. And the Word, before us, prophesied these organizations for this day, and this curse upon them. And the things that would take place by His truly anointed Church, will have the Word, a Word Bride. Here we are. Here it is, today, just as it was then.\n\nL-98 The Bible said, \"In the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established.\" I spoke of Balaam, I spoke of Balaam and of Moses. And I have spoke now of Micaiah and Zedekiah. Now I'm going to give one more. Which, there's hundreds of them, but one more, to make three witnesses. I got a whole string of them wrote down here; but to preserve time. [Matthew 18:16]\n\nL-99 Jeremiah who was a vindicated, outcast, but a vindicated prophet of God. They hated the man. They throwed unri-... overripe fruit at him, and everything else. And he put the curse upon them. And the things that he done, and laid out there on his sides, and things, and give signs that Israel was wrong. Every prophet, true prophet that ever raised in the world, cursed those denomination organizations of the church. How could it change, by the unchanging God?\n\nL-100 The Holy Spirit is the Prophet of this hour; He a vindicating His Word, proving It. The Holy Spirit was the Prophet of Moses' hour. The Holy Spirit was the Prophet of Micaiah's hour. The Holy Spirit, which wrote the Word, comes and confirms the Word.\n\nL-101 Now what happened in the time of Micaiah? Ahab was killed, and the dogs licked his blood, according to the Word of God. All you false teachers, so saith God, someday you'll reap what you're sowing, you blind leaders of the blind! I'm not angry. I'm just telling you a Truth. And I wouldn't have said this if up here, in that room, if the Holy Spirit didn't say, \"Say it in that manner.\" Have I ever told you anything wrong but what God proved it to be right? Wake up, my brethren, before it's too late! [I Kings 21:19]\n\nL-102 But let me say this. How could a thorn wake up and be a thistle, when it was predestinated to that? How could the Elected keep from seeing it? Because, they're elected to see it. \"All the Father has given Me will come,\" said Jesus, \"but none of them can come unless He has give it to Me before the foundation of the world, when their names was put on the Lamb's Book of Life,\" not on a church rector, but on the Book, Lamb's Book of Life. [John 6:37]\n\nL-103 Notice, Jeremiah stood up, vindicated before the people, yet they hated him.\n\nL-104 And so they went out and made a yoke, he did, and put it upon his neck, and went before the people. They said, \"Oh, we are the great people of God. Why, we are Israel. We are so sincere at our synagogue! We attend every Sunday, we, we offer sacrifices, and we pay in our money. How can Nebuchadnezzar ever hold the holy things of God?\" Huh! Your sins had done it. God said, \"If you'll keep My commandments, I won't do this. But, if you don't, it's coming to you.\" That's exactly right. Still the same. Keep His commandments, His Word for the hour, what He promised. [Jeremiah 27:2]\n\nL-105 Now notice. Now, Jeremiah, by the will of God, vindicated prophet, though hated... Every one of them was hated in their days. They done such strange things contrary to the denomination of that day, every one hated him, even kings and everything else. So he put a--a yoke on his neck, and said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD. You're going to be down there for seventy years,\" 'cause he had a understanding from the Word of God. \"Seventy years!\" [Jeremiah 25:11]\n\nL-106 Then Hananiah, Hananiah, I guess you pronounce it, H-a-n-a-n-i-a-h. Hananiah, a prophet amongst the people, come up, took the yoke off of Jeremiah's neck, and broke it. And said, be a big shot amongst the people, see, when he was speaking contrary to the Word of God. And he said, \"Two years they'll be back. THUS SAITH THE LORD.\" Two anointed prophets. How was the difference in them? One had the speaking the Word, and the other one didn't. Jeremiah said, \"Amen.\" [Jeremiah 28:10-11] 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min\n\nL-107 Before all the elders and the congregation, all Israel, see, he wanted to show he could be just as big as Jeremiah. \"You know they don't like you, anyhow. So I'm a prophet, also. I'm a more of a prophet than you are, because you are prophesying a lie. You tell me God's people is going to be under such-and-such a thing?\" That's what they say today, but you'll be there just the same, as a church. You're accursed with a curse. All you churches, denominations is holding to their tradition of man instead of the Word of God, you're cursed by God.\n\nL-108 Now notice, here he comes. Hananiah jerks this yoke off of his neck, a symbol of God, broke it, and said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD. Two years they'll be back.\" Just for a showoff, \"I'm So-and-so.\" Because he stood in, he was an organizational prophet.\n\nL-109 Jeremiah was a wilderness man that lived by himself. He prophesied evil against them all the time, 'cause they were evil. And this man was telling them, \"Oh, you're all right as long as you belong. As long as you're Israel, that's all is necessary. See, you, we... God ain't going to do that. I know there's a little something happened here, but don't be alarmed, don't be scared.\" Oh, brother, they still live today. \"Don't worry, everything is all right. We got everything under control. We're the Church.\" Don't you think that. Yeah.\n\nL-110 So he said, \"Everything is all right. They'll be back in two years. That's a little thing has happened. It's nothing unusual. We have that. Just Nebuchadnezzar come up here, but our God will take care of all this.\" But the Word said that they would be there seventy years; till that generation had faded away, and another generation. Forty years is a generation. \"This is almost two generations you're going to be down yonder.\" And Jeremiah said it according to the Word of God. [Jeremiah 28:11]\n\nL-111 Hananiah broke that! Jeremiah said, \"All right. Amen. But, Hananiah, let us remember this, we are both prophets. We're ministers.\" And I say this to you, my brother. Let us remember there has been prophets before us, and they prophesied against kingdoms, and they prophesied against certain things. But, remember, when the prophet said anything, he must prophesy according to the Word. Like Micaiah, and Moses, and all the rest of them. It must be according to the Word. If it isn't, then remember what happened. [Jeremiah 28:1-16]\n\nL-112 Then, Hananiah, his righteous indignation raised up. \"I'm Hananiah\" (no doubt), \"the prophet of the Lord, and I say, 'Two years.'\" In other words, \"I don't care what the Word says.\" His anointing, \"I say, 'Two years, they'll be back.'\" [Jeremiah 28:11]\n\nL-113 Jeremiah walked out from before him, went out and said, \"Lord, I don't care what he said, I still believe and know that Word says so. I'll stay true to You. I'll not be deceived by him.\"\n\nL-114 God said, \"Go tell Hananiah, 'I'll make it out of iron, the next yoke.'\" And because he did that, he was taken from the face of the earth, Hananiah was, that same year. There is our examples, both prophets. So many more could be said and talked of at this time. [Jeremiah 28:10-17]\n\nL-115 But watch. Jesus said, that, in this end time, again, the two spirits would be real close together again. Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now notice. It will be closer than that was. This is the end time. Oh, children! God have mercy upon us! Till, \"It would even be so real till it would deceive the very Elected if possible.\" Now how you going, how did we tell it in them days? How you going to tell it today? The same way, stay with the Word, \"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" Now care all this Message. And when you listen to the tape, even maybe I'll be gone someday when the Lord is finished with me here on earth, you'll refer back to this. Listen to my voice, what I'm telling you. If He takes me before His Coming, just remember, I've spoke to you in the Name of the Lord, by the Word of the Lord. Yes. [Hebrews 13:8], [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-116 Notice, \"Be so close together that it would deceive the Elected if it were possible,\" would do the same signs, the same miracles, by the same Spirit. Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Just like the prophets was that we 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min just talked about, prophets. Now, also it is written... [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-117 Let's turn to it, for this one, if you want to, Second Timothy 3. Let's not leave this one. And I don't want to...\n\nL-118 I look at that clock up there, and I--I want to omit a lot of it, and I don't think we should do it now. See? Notice. Just... If I am standing here, perspiring like I am, see, but I'm happy. And I know that this is true. Second Timothy 3:8.\n\nL-119 Paul, the man who said, \"If a Angel comes from Heaven and speaks any other word to you than that what I said, let him be cursed,\" now, a Angel come down. That's Second Thessalonians... Oh, I'm sorry. [Galatians 1:8]\n\nL-120 Notice in the Second Timothy 3:8. Watch Paul speaking now. Let's begin with about... Let's begin at the first of the verse, and listen now real close. You that have your Bible, read with me. You that don't have your Bible, listen close. The...This know also, that in the last days...Underline that, \"last days.\" That's when it's going to happen.... perilous times shall come. (We're in it.)For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, [II Timothy 3:1-2]\n\nL-121 Look at this bunch that we got today, rotten. Even in man out on the street, young man, pulling their hair down on their forehead, like with bangs like a woman. Perversion! Sodomites!\n\nL-122 Did you read in this year, this month's Reader's Digest? Said, \"The American people at the age,\" which I think it was, \"between twenty and twenty-five years old, is already in their middle-age condition.\" They're finished! They're rotten! Science says that, that a man is in his middle age, and a woman, when they're yet in their early twenties. Their body is so rotten and given over to filth.\n\nL-123 Oh, America, how oft God would have hovered you, but now your hour is come! You lead the world in filth.... blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,Without natural affections,...No true love even for one another, man to woman, woman to man. \"Not even natural affection.\" Filth, sexually!... trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, and despisers of those that are good,In other words, say, \"You bunch of holy rollers.\" Someone asked the other day about coming up here to the church. Said, \"Don't go up there. All it is is a big bunch of noise and carrying on.\"See, \"despisers of those.\"Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God;You say, \"Brother Branham, that's communists.\" What's the next verse say?Having a form of godliness, but (what?) denying the power thereof: (the Word, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, manifested, the promise for the day)...Just exactly like Hananiah, just exactly like Zedekiah, just exactly like Balaam, on back, other false prophets.Having a form of godliness, anointed... See?Having a form, anointed, ordained ministers...Having a form of godliness, but denying that He's the same yesterday, today... Denying His Word!How did they deny Jesus in that day? Who did they deny when they denied Jesus? The Word. They were religious. They taught from their Bible, but denied the present-day Word.What are they today? Same thing, anointed, preaching the Gospel of pentecost, but denying the present-day promise of the Word being vindicated, \"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" Do you see it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]For this is the sort are they which creep into houses, and lead... silly women laden with sin, led away by divers lusts,\"Our sewing parties and our so-and-so.\" Somebody come around trying to misinterpret the Word, and saying this, \"It's all right, sister, for you to have short hair. Don't pay no attention to that nitwit. See? Or, if you--you wear this; it's not that, 'it's what comes out of a man's heart that defiles him.'\" See? And do you realize that you are anointed with an evil, lustful, dirty spirit? Care, you might sing in the choir, with short hair, but you got an evil spirit. That's contrary to the Word. That's right. That's what the Bible said. And you say, \"Well, I wear shorts. It don't condemn me.\"\"Whosoever, if a woman puts on a garment that pertains to a man, it's an abomination in the sight of God.\" The unchanging God said that. [II Timothy 3:2-6], [Deuteronomy 22:5], [II Timothy 3:4], [II Timothy 3:5, 6], [Hebrews 13:8], [I Corinthians 11:15], [Deuteronomy 22:5]\n\nL-124 Oh, so many things, how could we just go through it; our time would be away. But you know enough to know what's right and wrong. And how can I make them do it? How can I do it? Say, \"Well, what you hollering about?\" I'm a witness against you. Someday, in the Day of Judgment, you'll have not a corner to go into.\n\nL-125 How could Micaiah stop that? How can Moses; screaming, trying to stop it, and Joshua and them running among the people, and Levi pulled his sword and slayed them, even? They went on just the same. 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min It's predicted that they're going to do it. And they're going to do it, for it's THUS SAITH THE LORD they're going to do it. You think them nominations will ever break up, their denomination come back to the Word? It's THUS SAITH THE LORD, they won't! Will they go into the antichrist? Exactly. It's THUS SAITH THE LORD, they will! \"So what are you saying about?\" I have to be a witness, and so do you, all believers. Watch. ... silly women laden with... divers lusts,\n\nL-126 \"Well, all the rest the women do.\" False prophets! Now listen. False prophets, I'm speaking of. Now what will they do in the last day? ... lead silly women... led away with divers lusts, \"Well, I know all the rest the women...\" All right, go ahead. [II Timothy 3:6]\n\nL-127 What'd I say just before this big happening here in California? \"You people here in Los Angeles, ever year when I come back there's more bobbed-haired women and sissyfied man than there was the first place, more preachers going into organization. You're not without excuse! If the mighty works had been done in Sodom and Gomorrah was done in you, it'd be standing today. Oh, Capernaum, thou who callest yourself by the name of the angels, Los Angeles!\" See what's happening? She is going right on to the bottom of the sea. When? I don't know when it's going, but it's going. You young people, if I don't see it in my day, you watch. She is gone!Ever learning,... never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.Now here is the shocking, here is the shocking part. Listen to this.Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith that was once delivered to the saints, of course.\"Concerning the Faith.\" \"And he shall turn the Faith of the fathers, or the children, back to the fathers.\" [II Timothy 3:7], [Matthew 11:23-24], [II Timothy 3:8]\n\nL-128 \"Reprobate concerning the Faith.\" Uh! You know what reprobate means? If you got a Scofield Bible, there's a \"h\" there. Right up there, says, \"apostasy.\" An apostasy, that's what it is.\n\nL-129 Now, just a minute. I want to look up something here. I think I wrote this down right. I'm not sure, but I want to say it, and look it up before I--I say it. Now, just one minute. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] \"Reprobates concerning the Truth, concerning the Faith.\" \"The Faith,\" there is only one Faith. That's right. \"Concerning the Faith, reprobates!\" Now I want to read Luke 18. Just a minute. You don't... You can put it down; you don't have to read it. And he spake a parable unto them unto this end, that men ought to always pray, and not... faint; Saying--saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, and regardeth not man: And there was a widow in the same city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary. And he would--and he would not for a while: but afterwards he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; Yet because this widow trouble me, I will avenge her, lest by... coming she weary me. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge his... elect, which crieth unto him day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? [Luke 18:1-8]\n\nL-130 Now that's the question. Here is where I wanted to get to, in Revelations 10. We'll get to it in a few minutes, and another Scripture verse. He said, \"In the days of the Message of the seventh angel, the mystery of God ought to be finished.\" Here is the question, is, if you follow in that line in this hour, will it be finished? \"Will I find the Faith?\" Will Malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time, \"Restore the Faith of the children, back to the Faith of the fathers, the original, the Word\"? See? [Revelation 10:7], [Malachi 4:6]\n\nL-131 \"Reprobates, Jambres and Jannes, as they withstood.\" Now, also, listen, Second Timothy 3:8. \"As Jan-... withstood Moses, also in the last days these same reprobates would come,\" now see where It says here, \"having a form of godliness,\" anointed ones. Now let's just... You go back and--and read it when you get home, so that I can finish out this, this morning, if I can. \"Reprobates concerning...\" Not reprobates in--in--in living; they're fine, cultured man. [II Timothy 3:8] 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min\n\nL-132 Now notice when Moses went down to Egypt, with a message of THUS SAITH THE LORD, and was vindicated; called on Israel, which was a people, not a church. Israel was a people; they never was a church. Cause, the word church means \"called-out ones.\" They were the people of God. Then when they become anointed under the Word, and called out, they become the church of God. And then backslid, because they believed not the Word of God, and listened to a false prophet. I hope that sinks in. Israel, being a people of God, come out under the hand of God, anointed with the Word... with the Power of God, seen the signs and wonders of God. And then when God was moving on with them, a false prophet come in, anointed, and taught something contrary to the original Word of God that they had heard; and every one of them perished in the wilderness, besides three people. Now hold it.\n\nL-133 \"As it was in the days of Noah, wherein eight souls were saved by water, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man.\" \"As it was in the days of Lot, where three came out of Sodom, so shall it be in the time when the Son of man shall be revealed.\" I'm only quoting Scripture, the Lord's Word, which, \"Heavens and earth will pass away...\" It'll be a minority! [Luke 17:26], [I Peter 3:20], [Luke 17:29-30]\n\nL-134 Notice here. Moses goes down to Aaron. Moses was to be God. God told him to be God, said, \"You be God, and let Aaron your brother be your prophet. You put the words in his mouth if you can't speak well.\" Said, \"But who made man dumb? Who made man to speak?\" The Lord did.And he walked down there. What did he do? He performed a true and just miracle that God told him to do. God told him to, \"Go cast your rod down.\" Picked it up, and it was a serpent. He picked it up, and turned back to a rod. Said, \"Go do that before Pharaoh, and say, 'THUS SAITH THE LORD.'\" [Exodus 7:1-2], [Exodus 7:10], [Exodus 4:15], [Exodus 4:11], [Exodus 4:3]\n\nL-135 And when Pharaoh saw this, we say, \"Why, what a cheap magician trick.\" Said, \"There's nothing to it. It's mental telepathy or something, you know. We got guys in our organization can do the same thing. 'Come here, Bishop So-and-so. And, you, you come out here.' We got them can do the same thing.\" That was Satan talking through Pharaoh. That was God talking through Moses.\n\nL-136 But watch this fellow come out. Jannes and Jambres walked out before Moses, and publicly before the people, and performed every miracle that Moses could do. \"They will deceive the very Elected if it's possible.\" That right? Performed the same thing that Moses did. You get it? Now remember, it's THUS SAITH THE SCRIPTURE, that it'll repeat again in the last days.What was the difference between Moses and Jambres?Moses said, \"Let blood come in the water.\"And these false prophets said, \"Sure, we put blood in the water, too.\" And it happened. [Exodus 7:20]\n\nL-137 So Moses said, \"Let there come fleas.\" What was he getting it? Straight from God. See?And what did he do? He said, \"Well, sure, we can bring fleas, too.\" And they did it. Any miracle that Moses could do, they could do, too!Remember, keep that in mind, we're coming to it, after a while. They can do anything the rest of them can do, but they can't stay with the Word. They can't stay with the Word. [Exodus 8:21]\n\nL-138 Now notice, they did it. But Moses, the true sent-prophet from God, commissioned by God, he never fussed with them, said, \"Here, you can't do that! You can't!\" He just let them alone, just let them go on. They're organizational prophets, but go ahead. Moses just went right on, listened to God. Whatever God said, \"Now you do this,\" Moses went and done it. He done a new thing. When they did, each one of them had a sensation or something, here they come. They did it, too, just exactly like Moses did.\n\nL-139 Now notice. These fellows appeared... Oh, you people, don't you miss this! These impostors, impersonators, appeared after the true one had went first. See? They come to impersonate. See, they have to. The devil cannot create anything; he just is a perverter of the original. And what is sin? Is righteousness perverted. What is adultery? The right act perverted. What is a lie? The truth misrepresented. A perversion! Look at Hananiah, a perversion of the original Word. Look at Balaam, a perversion of the original Word. Look at 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min Zedekiah, the perversion of the original Word. And the Bible said that these guys would come out, after the pervert... or to pervert the original Word vindicated and proved to be the Truth. [Jeremiah 28:1-17], [Numbers 22:1-41]\n\nL-140 \"Do the work of an evangelist,\" in that corner yonder, \"make full proof of your ministry. For the time will come when they'll not endure sound Doctrine, but after their own lusts shall heap for themselves teachers, having itching ears; and go ahead and do anything they want to, and, 'It's all right, we got the same signs and wonders.' And shall be turned from the Truth, and be brought into fables, dogmas.\" [II Timothy 4:5], [II Timothy 4:3-4]\n\nL-141 Oh, the awareness of the Holy Spirit, the awe that strikes a man's soul when he stops to think how real and plain it's right before us! Dig up that cornerstone out here and read a piece of paper that's put in there, thirty-three years ago. See what He said over yonder on--on Seventh Street, that morning when this cornerstone was laid. Now watch it. Watch down here on the river, when the Angel of the Lord came down in a form of a Pillar of Fire, hundreds of the churches, or peoples of the church, standing around on the bank; what He said, see if it's come to pass. See what's happened.It's so hard. I know it looks hard, brethren, out there. But it's... The Bible said, Jesus said Himself, \"It would deceive the very Elected if it was possible.\" No way around it. They'll never be able to see It. If it was possible, the very Elected would be deceived by it. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-142 Notice, these fellows appeared after God's true anointed was sent; by His true prophet, Moses. And when Moses would do anything, they would impersonate it.\n\nL-143 Now, brother, sister, I... This is my own church. I got a right to preach what I want to, as long as it's out of God's Word. And I ain't condemning you people, but let's just search that for the time and the hour that we're now living. Greetings to Brother Ruddell, to Junior Jackson, and them out here, our brother churches. I forgot them, a while ago. I think they're hooked in this morning, too, because of no--no room in the church.\n\nL-144 Just think of it now, just for a minute. They did the same miracles that Moses did. Moses brought fleas; they impersonated it and brought fleas. See?God said, \"The day you eat thereof, that day you die.\" [Genesis 3:3]\n\nL-145 Satan come around and said, \"Surely, you'll not die. You'll just be wiser. You'll have a better organization, a better...\" You know. \"You know, everything will be better for you, have more Light.\" See, just a perversion. Ought...And remember, THUS SAITH THE LORD, according to Second Timothy 3:18, that, \"In the last days, that this Jambres and Jannes would be on the earth.\" Now, I want you to notice there is two of them, see, impersonators. [Genesis 3:4], [II Timothy 3:8]\n\nL-146 Now we're going to get back to Sodom, after a while, them three's, find them three Angels that came down, and see the impersonation, and so forth, see, see which is right and wrong. See? See?\n\nL-147 Notice, they did the same miracles. But, notice, they impersonated after the true Word had been anointed, by the true one that God had sent; followed, secondarily. I wonder if we could think for a minute. Taking the people by the hand, not long ago, about twenty years ago, and a sign showed. Boy, there was more signs all over things, and everybody... One has got it in his right hand; one has got it in his left hand; the other one smells it. See, all kinds of... And I wonder... God won't let me tell you at this time what was really the truth, but one day you're going to find out. That was just to make their folly manifested. That wasn't right, at the beginning. I'll tell you, one day, if the Lord permits.\n\nL-148 Notice, they did the same miracles, but they didn't... Notice, they didn't do it till after the original Word went forth, first. That's the way Satan done in the garden of Eden. That's the way he done all time. Who prophesied first? Moses. Who come on the scene first, Moses or Balaam? Moses. Who come on the scene first, Jeremiah or Hananiah? You see what I mean? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-149 Notice, they copied. Carnal impersonators, sincere, thinking they were \"doing God a service,\" as David did, last week, but carnal impersonation. I'm just waiting a minute. I want you to think between these places. If I don't say it, surely the Holy Spirit will reveal it, especially to the Elected. See?\n\nL-150 Pharaoh's denomination says, \"We have man that can do that same thing,\" and they did it. See? Why did Pharaoh 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min do this? Why did God permit it? Why would God send a true, anointed prophet down there to perform a sign before Pharaoh, and then let a denominational copy come around and copy it before the people? Why would He let an impersonator rise up to do it, and do the same thing exactly the genuine Spirit of God done? See, the Scripture must be fulfilled. [Exodus 7:11-12]\n\nL-151 Notice, He did this so that He would harden the heart of Pharaoh and the Egyptians, to prove that Moses wasn't the only one that had the Word. They could do everything just the same as Moses could do.And why did God let this thing happen in the last days? So, the same thing as the lying spirit said to Zedekiah, \"How we going to get Ahab out there, to make these things come to pass?\" How is He going to get these people, trusting in their churches, to get out here to let this thing come to pass, that He predicted? They, in this Laodicean Church Age, \"Because thou saith thou art 'rich, and have need of nothing. I set as a queen.' Have nothing! Knowest thou not that you are miserable, wretched, blind? And I counsel to come buy of Me,\" He said, \"oil and gold.\" Why did He do it? [I Kings 22:20], [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-152 Why did He let this impersonation rise up in this last days, when these things are coming to pass by the true Word of God; and let impersonators come up and do the same thing, and deny the true Word of God? He did it for Moses. And Pharaoh did it against Moses; and those, Jannes and Jambres, did it against Moses. And the Bible said that it'll repeat again in the last days. Here we are. Now, if that ain't Scripture fulfilled, where is it at?\n\nL-153 Did Moses fuss at them and say, \"Here! Here! You can't do that. I'm the only one been ordained to do that. Here! You stop that, right now\"? He just let them go.Let them go on. Remember, the Bible said, \"As their folly was made manifest, so will these in the last day be made manifest,\" when the Bride is raptured and taken into the sky. Notice. [II Timothy 3:9]\n\nL-154 Moses, the true manifested Word, never said nothing, just let it go. But He did that so He could harden the heart of Pharaoh, deceive Pharaoh. He did that very same thing so He could deceive Ahab. And that one little guy standing there by himself, little Micaiah, telling them, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD.\" Here stood another one, anointed, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD.\" And contrary, one to another.\n\nL-155 We stand today with THUS SAITH THE LORD, that the water baptism in the last days is to be in the Name of Jesus Christ. And another man stand and perform miracles, and, a trinitarian. Show me the word trinity in the Bible. Show me where there's three Gods. Show me where there's such things as that. It's not in the Word of God. There is no such a thing as anybody ever baptized in the name of \"Father, Son, Holy Ghost,\" using those titles. All these things, \"Oh, it's all right, sisters. That's all right, just have long... your short hair. That's all right, you don't have to do this, that, or the other. Oh, that's nonsense, some old fogy.\" But the Bible said! And He promised, \"In the last days, He would send the Spirit of Elijah, and would call the people, the children of God, back to the original Faith like it was in the beginning, of the Word.\" That Word was confirmed, the Son of man in the last days, the same as it was at Sodom; yesterday, today, and forever. He promised to do it. It's God's promise. It's THUS SAITH THE LORD. [Malachi 4:6]\n\nL-156 Notice, they did the same thing, just as Moses did, until God got enough of it.Now remember, it's THUS SAITH THE LORD, it'll come to pass in this day. Now, search over the world; take every cult, take every clan, take every man, take every church! I charge you, in Christ's Name, to do this, you preachers. I charge you to read the newspapers or take consideration anywhere you want to go, and see if it isn't on the earth right now. See?Then, Matthew 24:24 is exactly right. \"False, anointed ones will rise in the last days, and will be false prophets, and shall deceive many.\" Watch it in the types now, as it comes now, see, \"Shall deceive many.\" \"Prophets,\" plural; \"Christs,\" anointed's, plural; many different ones, the Methodist, you know, and Baptist, and the Pentecostal, and so forth. See?But there is one genuine Christ, Spirit, and that's the Word made flesh as He promised to do it.Now we'll move on just a little further, to some more Scriptures. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-157 Until, God got enough of it, then it was over. Their folly was made manifest.\n\nL-158 Notice. Remember, the shuck looks exactly like the wheat grain. See? Now, you couldn't say, back there in the 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min Lutheran age, \"the stalk was the wheat,\" yet it's got the Life in it. Stalk is alright, the Life in the stalk was alright, but, remember, the Life advanced on; advanced from Elisha to Elijah. The Life keeps advancing on. But, remember, it's in another stage. It can't remain in that stage. We can't eat the a carrion of some other age. We can't eat Pentecostal a carrion, Methodist, or Baptist. See, it's become a carrion. We have fresh Food, the Word of this hour, so forth.\n\nL-159 Remember, the shuck is exactly like the grain of wheat. You can't... It didn't look like it in the blade, it didn't look like it in the tassel, but it sure did in the shuck. Didn't look like in the... Jesus Christ the same yesterday, in Luther; didn't look like it in Wesley; but it sure does in Pentecost, a \"deceive the very Elected if it was possible.\" See? There is your ages.\n\nL-160 But remember, that Pentecostal church, in the last days, was the Laodicea; and Christ was turned out, the Kernel, the Wheat, Itself. When He tried... Remember, when He tried to manifest Hisself in the church, He was taken out. It was still a church, claimed to be; anointed. But here is the Word, Christ Himself, that's the anointed Word which shall come for the rest of His Body, the Bride. The anointed, of the same water that watered the wheat, as we talked about, also waters the tarers, anointed ones. Only the Elected, or predestinated, will be able to detect the difference between them. Now, Ephesians 5:1 tells you so, and about how it was.\n\nL-161 They are anointed ones. Everybody say, \"Glory to God! We got freedom down here. Hallelujah! We... Oh, hallelujah! We speak in tongues, and jump. We got freedom of the women; you people try to put them under all these kind of things.\" See? Go ahead. There ain't nothing you can do. Say, \"Well, we speak in tongues. We shout. We dance in the Spirit. We preach the Word.\" Absolutely. Not a thing to say against it. So do these men back here in the Bible.Jesus said, \"It'd deceive the very Elected if it was possible, the very Elected.\" [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-162 Now notice the shuck. From the original Grain, Grain that went in the ground, It was not no organization. It was one Grain, in Itself. But when it come up, it was not a Grain; it was an organization, see, leaves, corn. Then It went into another stage, which was a tassel. Still it wasn't like the beginning. It was an organization. It went into the shuck, many leaves, Pentecost, almost shaped out now. Look at it. It's taking shape all the time, almost exactly like the same, looks exactly like a Grain of wheat when you see that little hull there. But finally It's manifested, and no organization. There is no more carriers. Organization is just a carrier. No more carriers; the stalk must die, the shuck must die, the everything else must die, but the wheat lives on. That's the body of the resurrection, comes right down and picks them up. \"They which are last will be first, and they which are first will be last.\" See, picks them right up in the resurrection. Are you following this? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] All right. Notice, the grain is... [Luke 13:30]\n\nL-163 The shuck looks exactly like the grain. And a man raising a wheat farm, or something another, would look and say, \"Praise God, I got a crop of wheat,\" when he ain't got one speck of wheat. It looks just exactly like the wheat, but it's the shuck.\n\nL-164 Now, friends, go back with me. Where is the first revival come, after (the death) the days when the grain of wheat had to fall in the ground, the Body, the Bride of Christ? Christ organized His Bride, is that right, His Church? He never organized It; He just set apostles, and prophets, and so forth, in the Church, to keep It clean. But at Nicaea, Rome, three hundred and six years later, they organized it and made an organization out of it. Is that right? And it died. Everything that didn't agree with that church was put to death. And it laid still, for hundreds of years, in the dirt. But, after a while, up she come in Luther. The first little sprigs of corn come up. The second, it budded out from there. They went on, had Zwingli and so forth, and the other organizations and so forth. Then, after a while, come the Anglican along. And then what happened? Here come Wesley along with a new revival, the tassel, that looks a little more like the Wheat. Then what happened to that? It organized, and dried up and died. The Life went right into a shuck, and the shuck come forth almost perfectly like the Wheat. But, finally, its folly was made manifest in the last eight or ten years, especially in the last three years. Now what does it do? Pull away from the Wheat. 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min\n\nL-165 Now why hasn't there been an organization start up in these last twenty years of this great revival; it's anointed prophets, anointed teachers, so forth, but why ain't there? There is nothing beyond the Grain. See, It's back, without an organization. Oh, my, a blind man could see that. It cannot organize; It's so firmly against it. It's the grain of Wheat, Itself. The Son of man will be made manifest. The grain of Wheat will come back to Itself again, the Son of man in the last days.\"And there will come false, impersonations of It, in the last days, that'll almost deceive the Elected if possible.\" Look at their organizational shucks pulling away now. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-166 It only lets the Wheat be known, to the Elected, which are part of It. Notice how beautiful this is brought in here now. Only the... Notice, the anointed ones be able; the true, Elected, predestinated, Ephesians 5:1, or 1:5, rather, will be ordained, elected. They are the only ones that it will not deceive. Notice, the anointed prophets will be false, and there among it will be true anointed. How you going to tell it? By the Word. Like, we have it in shadow. Do you see it? Say, \"Amen. [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] See? [Ephesians 1:5]\n\nL-167 Notice, the anointed ones, only the Word will separate them, not the signs. Oh, no. They'll do the same signs, but the Word what's separated them. Sure. They all prophesied. They all done this, that, and the other, sure, just the same. Jesus said they'd do the same thing. But the Word is what separated them, notice, not signs.\n\nL-168 Did you notice? Jesus said here, in Matthew 24. He didn't say, \"There shall rise false Jesuses in the last days.\" Oh, no, they would never stand still for that. No. You get a Pentecostal that's a real Pentecostal, say, hisself, he is \"Jesus\"? See? You get a false Methodist, or a Baptist, or somebody like that, or one of the organizations, say, \"We are Jesus\"? They know better than that. They ain't going to do that. But the Bible said they would be \"false Christs,\" not Jesuses, but, \"false Christs.\" They wouldn't recognize, say, \"I'm Jesus.\" Oh, no. [Matthew 24:11]\n\nL-169 But they're \"false Christs,\" and don't know it, because they're contrary to the Word. And God vindicates the same. Now, I'm just bringing this right down to a showdown now, 'cause you've seen the same thing done by these people that's been done in the real. And Jesus said so. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-170 Now, as I've said, now to you people out on, in the telephone land there, I--I'm not condemning you, but this is my church and--and my group that the Holy Spirit set me over, and I've got to tell them the Truth. The hour is getting late.\n\nL-171 Now, they would not stand for that, but, \"false Christs,\" false, anointed ones, almost with every sign and every letter of the Word. \"They believe baptism of the Holy Ghost?\" Absolutely. \"Believe in all this?\" Yep. \"Believe in speaking in tongues?\" Yep. \"Believe signs and wonders follow, signs will follow them?\" Yep. That's not Methodists, that's not Baptists. No, no. That's Pentecostals. See, this is the last days. [Matthew 24:24] Now, the first church age would never noticed that. Methodist church age never noticed it; Baptist church age, they never noticed it; Presbyterian church age, they never noticed it. But, the Pentecostal, so close like the real Thing! That's where, the Wheat, the shuck is almost like the Wheat. They would never notice it. See? They wouldn't. But it's the last days, this day. Yes, sir.\n\nL-172 Notice, just like it was at the beginning, so will it be at the end. As Eve just misinterpreted one Word, Satan did to Eve, and she believed it. She, not he; the church, not Him. See? The church was the one that got the false word. See? Not Adam; Eve. Not the Christ; the church, the bride, the anointed, supposed to be, calls herself the Bride, see, she got the false word. Can't you see that? Why, it laces together like a shoestring, like the lashes on your eye. Why, everything you'll turn to, the Bible, It just lashes it right together. Eve, not Adam; Eve believed it, not Adam. The bride today, so-called, believed it; not the Christ. The bride has all kinds, so-called bride; same signs, same wonders, same everything; but not the real One. See? \"Deceive the Elected if it was possible.\" Now quickly, if we can get this finished in fifteen minutes, we'll be on time. Notice real close now, so you won't--you won't be misunderstanding, to you. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-173 Now, no, they wouldn't stand to be called \"false Jesus.\" They wouldn't be, stand to call, \"Jesus.\" Certainly not. That's too plain. Anybody would know that. Anyone would know they wasn't Jesus. I don't care if they had oil on their 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min back, and blood on the hands and up-and-down their eyes, they still know it's... Anybody that's got good sense, knowed it wasn't Jesus. See? They wouldn't stand for that. But they call themself \"the anointed.\" And they do signs and wonders, \"almost to deceive the Elected.\" \"But false Christs, anointed ones, shall arise, and shall deceive the Elected if it were possible.\" [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-174 Now watch closely. Don't miss this statement, because it's worthy to listen. He's just putting some tape on this microphone here, keep it from flying up. I've been perspiring; dropped on the tape, you see.\n\nL-175 And so it'll be just like It, the Bible, said it would be. See?\n\nL-176 Notice, not false Jesuses. \"False Christs!\" They believe they're anointed, but they know they're not Jesus. See, that's too plain. If man went up and said, today, \"Look at the scars in my hand. Look at on my brow. I am Jesus.\" Well, now, we know that that's wrong. And, remember, Jesus never said that them guys would appear. He said there would appear \"false Christs.\" \"Christs,\" plural, denominations, and so forth, anointed ones; anointed with a denominational spirit, and not the Word. You follow it? Not false Jesus. \"False Christs,\" false, anointed ones. See? Oh, how plainly! How we... Surely you won't miss it! [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-177 Now, remember, I've always told you there is three classes of people. There is three races of people; Ham, Shem, and Japheth, three races. Three classes, and I said, that is the believer, make-believer, and unbeliever. It's always been, always will be. See? There was Moses, the believer; there was Jannes and Jambres; the unbelievers. See? There was Balaam; Moses... Always that three classes of people, three classes; believer, make-believer, and unbeliever. [Genesis 9:18-28]\n\nL-178 Now remember, the unbeliever, the denominational church, don't believe in any signs at all; cold, formal, starchy, the church in the world, the denomination. But the make-believer is that shuck. That's the guy that makes-believe. And then there is a real believer that's really true. Now, watch them as they go along now, just for a minute.\n\nL-179 And notice how bold these unbelievers are, or these make-believers and unbelievers. My! They're bold, look, even as Satan stood right up in the Presence of the true Word, and said, \"It's written!\" Is that right?Why did Satan do that? Is because he didn't know the Word for that... He knew the Word was for that hour, but he doubted this humble little Man being that Word. \"If Thou be the Son of God. I know the Son of God is coming, because It said He would do that. And it's written, 'He'll give His Angels charge over Thee.' See? Prove it to me! Do a miracle! Let me see You do it.\" See? See?See, the unbeliever, make-believer, impersonator. Look at Judas right among them, the same time, make-believer! See? Notice, and there was the true Word. , [Matthew 4:6]\n\nL-180 How bold they are! \"Now, don't pay any attention to that nonsense. There is nothing to It. Don't go up there. It's just a bunch of noise. There is nothing to That. That's just all fiction. That's in your mind.\" See, see what I mean? Stand right in the Presence of the Word and say it.\n\nL-181 Satan walked right in. As the Bible said over here in Jude, \"Even the Archangel, when disputing with Satan, said, 'The Lord rebuke you.'\" Against the Word Itself!And here is the antichrist, the anointed, standing right here against the genuine Word of the day, Jesus Christ, and said, \"It's written.\" [Jude 1:9]\n\nL-182 Look at the last days. \"It'd be so close it'd deceive the very Elected if it was possible.\" Oh, my! The reason the Elected won't be deceived, you know why? Is because they are the Word. See? Just like the Life that's in the root, I said a while ago, It can't deny Itself. See, It is the Word and in the season of the Word. That's right. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-183 Just like Jeremiah, he knew. No matter what Hananiah said, he knowed where he was at. And that's exactly like Moses did, and--and the rest of them. That's, he knowed, no matter what the false prophet said, there was the Word of God. It was written. That's the reason Micaiah could say, \"All right, you just wait and see.\" Ahab said, \"I believe my prophets. My organization is right. When I come back in peace... Put that fellow back yonder in the prison. I'll take care of him! Give him bread of sorrow. Turn him out, don't have no fellowship with him at all. When I return in peace, we'll take care of that guy.\" [I Kings 22:27] 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min\n\nL-184 Micaiah said, \"If you return at all, the Lord hasn't spoke to me.\" He knowed he had THUS SAITH THE LORD, and his vision was exactly with THUS SAITH THE LORD; not for some other season, but for that season. Amen! Hallelujah! The season! [I Kings 22:28]\n\nL-185 Bold, stand up and dispute with a Archangel! It's been said, that, \"Fools will trod with hobnail shoes where Angels fear to walk.\" That's right.\n\nL-186 The reason the Elected, Jesus said, won't be deceived, because they are that Word. They can't be nothing else. They can't hear nothing else. They don't know nothing else. That's right. Remember, Moses wasn't carried away with all their impersonations. Was he? Moses said, \"Now, wait a minute, Pharaoh. You know what? The Lord told me to do this, but, glory to God, I see that your boys can do the same thing. So, tell you what I'll do, I'll join up with you\"? Huh! That don't sound like a prophet of God. No, indeed! He stood just as firm as he could stand. He knowed, exactly, God would take care of it somehow, 'cause He promised to. \"I'll be with you. I'll not leave you.\" [Deuteronomy 4:31], [Hebrews 13:5]\n\nL-187 He knowed, so he didn't join up with them. Oh, no. He stayed right with them. He didn't want none of their denominations. He stayed right with God. He wasn't carried away by all the things they could do. When they did one thing... He brought lice; they brought lice. He brought blood; they brought blood. He brought everything; they impersonated him every way, right along. He just stood still. He knowed exactly what. God was on the job. You understand now? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] You take two and two, and make four? [\"Amen.\"] You don't want to scorch too hard. So, so you--you understand, see. [Exodus 8:17], [Exodus 7:20, 22]\n\nL-188 Why? They won't be deceived by it. The real believer, they are predestinated Seed that should stand in the day.\n\nL-189 Just, also, Jesus said this, \"Many will come in that day, in My Name, and say, 'Lord, have not I cast out devils in Thy Name?'\" Jesus said, \"At the end days, when the time is all over and the great resurrection come, that many will come and set down in the Kingdom.\" The Kingdom of God is within you.Many, the weeds will come and set right down with the Wheat, say, \"Now, wait a minute, Lord! I spoke in tongues. I shouted. I danced in the Spirit. I cast out devils. I spoke with tongues. I done all these things.\"What'd He say? Notice. \"You workers of iniquity, I never even knew you.\" [Matthew 7:22-23], [Luke 13:27]\n\nL-190 What is iniquity? Ask somebody. It's \"something that you know you ought to do, and you won't do it.\" They know that Word. They hear It. You're listening to this tape. You're listening to this Message. You see the Lord God say so; you see Him confirm it, make it true. And you know This just as plain as the sun is shining outside, but you that'll hold onto your denomination, hold onto those false things; you worker of iniquity!\"Oh, yes, I had great campaigns. I done this. I done that.\"Said, \"You depart from Me, you worker of iniquity, I never knew you.\" [Matthew 7:23]\n\nL-191 \"Well, the Holy Ghost fell on me.\" I don't doubt that a bit. \"I spoke in tongues. I sang in the Spirit. I done...\" I don't doubt that a bit. No question to that. Oh, brother, sister, what kind of a condition! This is a trembling time. Where we at? This Word is coming to Life now. Notice.\n\nL-192 Yeah, He said they would do that. Notice, \"You workers of iniquity.\" I got a Scripture writ down here. I don't know just where it was. I've took so much time. I'm going to look it up, just a minute, and see what it was. I got--I got Matthew 7:21. I--I just don't know where. I, sometimes I don't jot something down with it, well, I--I preaching like this, I--I forget what I was referring to on the Scripture. Matthew 7:21.Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.Many shall say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied...Prophets, anointed ones! That right? \"Wasn't we a prophet? Wasn't we anointed, anointed one? Have not I prophesied in Thy Name? And in Thy Name have not I cast out devils?\" How can you do that, and refuse to be baptized in Jesus' Name? See? Oh, my! See how deceiving? Right up to that very point, then drop back. They go right up to the Word, then drop back. Now watch this. We get this out, just a minute.Many will say unto me... Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied, we been prophets?...Yeah, I spoke of that in Matthew 24:24.... and in thy name... cast out devils? and in thy name done many wond-... many works?And then will I confess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.\"When It was put right before you and you seen It, and seen 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min It moving, seen It was the Word; and for your denominational sake, you was held into it. I never even knew you. I don't care how many devils you cast out, how many you did this and that; I knew nothing about you.\"Balaam said, \"I prophesied right, in Your Name. It come to pass.\" [Matthew 7:21-22], [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-193 \"That's exactly right, but, when it come to the Word, you refused It.\" Oh, brother, see the deceiving part? Not \"prophet,\" exactly; but with the Word, true Word, vindicated Word made manifest. \"You workers of iniquity!\" [Luke 13:27]\n\nL-194 Try, Satan has tried in all ages to impersonate the true Word. We know that, don't we?\n\nL-195 Notice, come up to the borderline and quit. Looky here, He said, in Hebrews the 6th chapter, now, we was reading a while ago. I told you refer back to it, and we will for the next couple minutes. He said:... but thorns and thistles... which is nigh unto rejection; whose end is to be burned. (Borderline!)... ye who have tasted... the heavenly gift,...\"Tasted,\" other words, you seen It! You can't [Brother Branham smacks his lips togther--Ed.] just taste It with your mouth. But you seen It, and you knew It was the Truth. You knowed It was the Truth. \"Tasted the Heavenly gift.\"... and made partakers of the Holy Spirit, as It fell upon you,... tasted of the good word of God,...\"Tasted,\" you seen It was right. \"And the Holy Ghost falling upon you,\" the weed in the field.... and then turn away,...\"Denying the very Christ that sanctified you, and called you, and put that anointing upon you.\"... there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin, for that.It's unpardonable! \"It's impossible for them to ever come to the knowledge of the Truth.\"For it is impossible for those who were... made partakers of the Holy Spirit,Fell upon the weeds, see, \"Started in with Jesus, and, 'Lord, I'm going through,'\" but when you hit the Word, you turn back. \"Made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and even tasted, or seen the Word Itself manifested.\" And then turn away from It, \"It's totally impossible for them to ever see It or come to It.\"That's THUS SAITH THE SCRIPTURE. Now, you... \"Heavens and earth will pass away, but It won't.\" You see it? \"Totally impossible.\" The Bible said so, and the Spirit bears record of it. [Hebrews 6:8], [Hebrews 6:4-6], [Matthew 24:35]\n\nL-196 Notice, let me give you a little example. Look at those people who come out under Moses' prophecy, come out of that organization, and come out of everything, under the prophecy, saw the great works and wonders, and things like that, and come up to the borderline of going in. Now, Lee, there comes your \"name on the Book.\" See? You've got it fixed out. And you that's not here, and out in the--on the hook-ups, it's Doctor Lee Vayle setting here. He is grammarizing this book of the Seven Church Ages. And the problem come up, or the question, about your \"name taken off the Lamb's Book of Life.\" See, it's puzzled a lot of ministers. But wait till you get the book, you'll understand it if you just got any Light in you. See?\n\nL-197 Notice, now, you'll turn your head and won't even look at It if you don't want to see It. Like my mother used to say, \"You can't get blood from a turnip, 'cause there's no blood in it.\"\n\nL-198 Notice, the Light has to come; it's not in darkness. The Light comes to the darkness, and the darkness perceives It not. Notice now the anointed ones in this day. As Moses brought out those children of Israel; and they listened and got all confused with that great nation up there. Now, Israel was interdenominational. It had no land, had no home. It was going to a home. We have no church. We're no... We're--we're going to a Church, the Church of the Firstborn, the Church that's in Glory; not the church that's on earth, by a man. The Church that's in Glory, the called-out ones, predestinated to Eternal Life, see, going to their Home. And when they come up to the place to cross over, they doubted the Word, and come back. After Joshua and Caleb and them had went over and brought back a bunch of grapes, to prove to them the land was there, the Word of God's promise, \"It's a good land, milk and honey.\" And brought it back, on this side, to prove it to them. And they tasted of it, and said, \"Oh, oh, we can't do it, though.\" What happened? They perished in the wilderness. They stayed right there and organized themselves, and died, every one of them. But the ones that went over and brought back, Joshua and Caleb; Moses was translated. A type of the waiting for the Church; and the resurrection of the Old Testament, New Testament; and the raptured Body. See the three there? Have to keep them three's in line, see, so, in the believer and unbeliever. See? [Numbers 13:23, 27] 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min\n\nL-199 Notice how it was \"totally.\" Remember, God never did forgive that sin. Now how they going to come in? If it's thorns, to begin with, it's thorns at the end. Only the predestinated will see It.\n\nL-200 Notice closely now. Just like in the days of Saint Martin, right before the Dark Ages; a godly little man. How many ever read the writings of Saint Martin? Many of you have. We went down to get the writings of Saint Martin; the priest said, \"But he wasn't canonized.\" Sure, he wasn't; not by them, but he was by God. The Holy Spirit told us to put him there on that third church age. See?\n\nL-201 Look what a godly little man he was; called, predestinated. His parents, heathen. His daddy, a soldier. He had to follow his line, to be a soldier. And, when he did, and always believed that there was a God somewhere; a man of the woods, and could see God. One day he passed by a city, and there was an old bum laying there, dying, asking somebody... He was cold that night. \"Oh,\" said, \"give me something to cover me up; I'll die tonight.\"\n\nL-202 Nobody would do it. And Martin stayed off to one side and watched him for a while. Nobody would do it. He only had one coat. He'd freeze, hisself, he was on duty, if he--he give him that coat. So he thought, \"Both of us have a chance to live if I'll divide with him.\" So he took his own coat, and split it in two with his saber, and wrapped the old bum in it. He wrapped his own coat around. Everybody said, \"Look what a funny-looking sentry. Look what a funny-looking soldier, half a coat wrapped around him!\"\n\nL-203 The next night, when he was off of duty and laying in his bed, he was woke up. Looked, standing there in the room, and there stood Jesus Christ wrapped in that old piece of garment that he put around him. He knowed right then, \"What you do unto My little ones, that you have done unto Me, to My anointed,\" laying there.He was a great servant of God. The church made fun of him, persecuted him, kicked him out, and everything else, but he was a prophet of God. What he said come to pass. There's many believed him in that age, too. [Matthew 25:45]\n\nL-204 I want to show you how deceiving the Devil is. One day he was setting in his study. Up come a mighty angel, crown on his head, golden shoes on, lace around his garments of gold, and said, \"Martin, do you know me?\" He said, \"I am your Lord and Saviour. I'm the One that saved you. Worship me, Martin.\" But that prophet, knowing there was a little something strange there, he kept looking at him. He said, \"Martin, I am your Saviour, Jesus Christ. Worship me! Don't you know me, Martin?\"\n\nL-205 Martin kept looking at him, the Scripture running through his mind. He said, \"Satan, get away from me.\" He said, \"You got a crown on your head. And the Word of God says His 'saints will crown Him' at the end of the age.\" Wouldn't that a-been Pentecostal bait? Watch that Word, brother. That's where it pays.\n\nL-206 One day, again, in the monastery, they had an old saint down there, bunch of young monks. There was one of them kind of irritable. Watch this, here is a good--a good parable today. He wanted to be something above the rest of them. He wanted to show hisself, authority, bigger something, something better, all class, you know, and great big something. He had to be classical. Always wanted the other brethren not... You know, he had to be different. See? He, no matter what it was, he was very arrogant. He was the only pebble on the beach. There was nobody could touch him. Now watch what happened. He had to have something big. He had to compare with the--the big societies. You follow me? See? So, he said, he prophesied. He said, \"The Lord has made me a prophet, also. I'm a prophet.\" Now, there was one identified prophet in the land, and that was Saint Martin; he was born a prophet.\n\nL-207 But this kid said, young fellow said, young monk about twenty-five years old. He said, \"The Lord has made me a prophet, and I'm going to prove it to you.\" Said, \"Tonight the Lord is going to give me a big, fine robe, put it upon me, a white robe, and set among you. Then all of you shall come up to me, see, and you'll take orders from me.\"\n\nL-208 Now compare that today, see, \"I'll be the head of the organization. I'll take care of you, rest of you monks.\" And sure enough, \"That night, a lights come on in the building,\" so the writing of Saint Martin says. Read it. And it's authentic. It's history. And the lights come on, and all the rest watched, and here come... He had on a white robe, standing among them. He said, \"See what I told you?\" But that's contrary to the Word.\n\nL-209 And when he went and got the old dean of the college, he walked up-and-down a little bit, said, \"Son, that don't 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min sound right.\" He said, \"There's only one way.\" Here it is! \"There's only one way for us to know. It looked supernatural.\" Boy, Pentecost would have grabbed that, root, sinker, line, hook, and everything else! He said, \"The miracle may seem all right, but it don't seem right to the Word. Now, we have such a person, an anointed prophet, by the name of Martin. Come, go up before him.\" The guy said, \"No, no! Martin ain't got nothing to do with this.\"\n\nL-210 And said, \"You're going, anyhow.\" And they grabbed him by the arm, to take him before Martin, and the robe left him.\n\nL-211 See, \"Deceive the Elected if it were possible.\" See, they know them. Jesus said, \"My sheep know My Word.\"\"Oh,\" you say, \"'hear My \"Voice.\"'\"That's His Word. \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word.\" See? The predestinated knows this. \"A strange word, or a strange voice, they won't follow.\"That's the way with those fellows back there; they wouldn't follow. They knowed that Martin was there, a prophet of that age, identified by God through the Word, knowed the Word. And that man wouldn't stand before It. [John 10:27], [Matthew 4:4], [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-212 He also said, \"Where the Carcase is,\" or the Word, \"there, in season, the eagles will be gathered.\" Now that's Matt-... You want to put that down, that's Matthew 24:28. Just a little bit before, Matthew 24:24; four verses below it, see, if you want to get it. \"Where the Carcase is,\" the Manna is, the Word is, \"there the eagles will be gathered.\" [Matthew 24:28]\n\nL-213 Now I must hurry. I looked up there and seen what time... It's--it's seven minutes or eight minutes after twelve. I'll hurry real quick, or we can finish it up tonight, either one you want to do it. This morning or tonight? Huh? How many has to go home today after the service, let's see your hand, see. Oh, my, better keep on! I'm sorry to hold them people on them phones out there like that, but I'll hurry. It's worth more than your money. I believe it is, to me, see. Your money will perish. This won't; It's the Word. See?\n\nL-214 \"Where the Carcase is, there the eagles will be gathered.\" Where the Carcase, where the--the--the killing is, there the eagles will be gathered. Where the fresh Meat is, the Word of the season, there the eagles will gather.But after it's rottened, then the vultures will swarm to it. Yeah. See what I mean? When a kill is made, here comes the eagles; but after it lays there, and rotten, then here comes the vultures. The eagle won't have nothing to do with it. See?Jesus said, \"Where the Carcase is,\" where the Manna fell, the night the Manna falls fresh, \"there the eagles will gather for It.\" That's the Manna for the day. See? Notice. [Matthew 24:28]\n\nL-215 But after it gets rotten, maggots get in it, then here comes the vultures. They can't smell it till it gets rotten. No wonder Jesus stood up there and said, \"Jerusalem, you that stoned every prophet!\" Notice that personal pronoun, see, \"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how oft would I...\" Who was He? \"How oft would I have gathered you as a hen would her brood, you that stoned every prophet I ever sent to you,\" that great church, Jerusalem. [Luke 13:34], [Matthew 23:37]\n\nL-216 The Jerusalem which not here on earth, \"but we are of the Jerusalem of Above,\" where the Word come from, from predestination, see. Not old Jerusalem that perishes; the New Jerusalem that can't perish. Not the old Jerusalem, was built by man; but the New Jerusalem built by God, see, the Word up there now being made manifest. \"In My Father's house are many mansions. I'll go and prepare them for you,\" the Creator making the streets of gold, and so forth. That's the One that doesn't perish. [John 14:2]\n\nL-217 \"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how oft would I,\" from the beginning of time; not a third Person, somebody else, but, \"I would have hovered you as a hen did her brood, but you would not. But now your hour is come.\" See?\"Where the Carcase is, the eagles will gather.\" But after the carcase is rotten, then the buzzards gather. See? [Luke 13:34], [Matthew 24:28], [Matthew 23:37]\n\nL-218 Notice. Moses, he never give the children of God... Moses was an eagle, and he never give the children of God Noah's leftovers. He had the fresh Word of God. \"The Lord God met me in the wilderness, and confirmed His Word, and sent me down here to call you out.\" Then there come impersonators around, impersonating it. See? But he had the Word of the hour.Cause, God said to Abraham, the one who had the promise, \"Your seed shall sojourn in a strange 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min land, four hundred years, but I'll visit them and take them out with a mighty hand.\" [Acts 7:6], [Exodus 12:40]\n\nL-219 Moses said, \"Now, the Lord God will speak to me and show me, and has told me what to do, and I'll tell you.\" Said, \"'I AM' sent me.\"\"I AM!\" Not \"I was, or will be.\" \"I AM,\" present tense, the Word now. Not the Word that was, or Word that will come; the Word that's now. See? You get it? \"I AM!\" \"I AM\" is the Word. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.\" Is that right? \"I AM.\" \"God sent me as His prophet, to vindicate this to be true. I am the answer to this Word, told me come down here and do this.\" , [John 1:1], [Exodus 3:14]\n\nL-220 And when he did it, Pharaoh said, \"Well, we got plenty of boys in our group can do that, too,\" impersonators. Jesus said, \"Now, that's going to repeat again in the last days,\" see, claiming the same thing. Watch who come down first. Watch who stayed with the Word. That's it. That's how it's known, so you see.\n\nL-221 We notice, Moses never give them what was Noah's time, \"We'll build an ark now, 'cause that's the Word, you know. Noah built an ark one day.\" No, vultures was eating on that. No, no. No.\n\nL-222 This is a promised Word. Notice, for his message he had from God, he had the genuine predestinated Word of God for that hour. Neither did Jesus serve them Moses' leftover. Moses had the Word for that hour, but Moses was a prophet. Here is God Himself, see, He never served them Moses'--Moses' leftover. But just look at the vultures there in that organization, was glutting over it. \"We know! We got Moses! We don't have to have You.\"\n\nL-223 He said, \"If you'd have knowed Moses, you would know Me, because Moses spoke of Me.\" Oh, my! See? \"Where the Carcase is, the eagles will gather.\" Eagles! The fresh kill of the Word, the Word that's raised up and fattened, and been made manifest and give out to the Food for the children. Now, the old carcase that's laid there for hundreds of years, there it'll be. Same now! Luther had a message of repentance; but, you bunch of Lutheran buzzards! Baptist had a message; but, you Baptist buzzards! See? The Pentecost had a message; coming home now, Pentecostal buzzards! \"But where the Carcase is, there the eagles will gather.\" [Matthew 24:28], [Luke 17:37]\n\nL-224 Remember, you couldn't feed a Lutheran, back in them days (you can now), Catholic a carrion. No, sir. He had fresh meat. That was that church age. You couldn't feed Methodist, Lutheran message. Oh, no, he didn't want that a carrion. It's rotten. See, the Life had done left it and went into something else. That's the old stalk that's dead, back there. The Life is moving on. Neither can you feed the Bride of Jesus Christ Pentecostalism. No, indeedy! Maggot-blowed organizations; nothing doing! No, no! For the promise is, \"And before that great and terrible day shall come, I'll send unto you Elijah the prophet. He will restore the hearts of the children back to the Faith of the fathers again.\" \"All these promises had been made in the Bible, I will do it, and there the eagles will gather.\" \"All that the Father has given to Me will come to Me.\" See? [Malachi 4:5-6], [John 6:37]\n\nL-225 Jesus never tried that. But when Jesus come, He found them swarms of vultures, \"We got Moses and the law.\" See? Well, that was good eating way back yonder when it was killed and give to them. See, that was all right then. But this is what was predicted to Moses, himself, that killed the sacrifice, said, \"The Lord your God shall raise up among you, of your own brethren, a Prophet. It'll come to pass, that every one will not cling to that Prophet and what He says, will be cut off from amongst the people.\" And it was. [Acts 3:22], [Deuteronomy 18:18]\n\nL-226 Look how about six hundred different prophecies fulfilled right there, of the Old Testament, to Jesus Christ. \"They pierced My hands and My feet.\" About, I forget how many was fulfilled in the last seven or eight hours of His life, all them prophets said, perfectly. [Psalms 22:16]\n\nL-227 If I prophesied today that a certain thing would happen in a year from now, maybe I got--I got twenty percent chance for it to happen, whether it's right or wrong. And if I predicted that that would happen, and didn't say when, I got a smaller percent. If I predicted when it would happen, gives me a smaller margin. If I predicted the place it 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min happened, it gives it still a smaller margin. If I predicted the... who it would be on, then I still got about one hundred thousandths of a margin it ever coming to pass, if it's not true. And every Word, hallelujah, that was wrote of that Messiah, was fulfilled to the letter. Even till one day, reading the Scriptures, He stopped right in the middle of the sentence, and said, \"The Spirit of God is upon Me to preach the Gospel, and deliver the...\" And stopped right there in the middle of the sentence, because the rest of it's at His second Coming. Amen! \"Heavens and earth will pass away; My Words shall not.\" See? [Mark 13:31], [Luke 4:18], [Matthew 24:35]\n\nL-228 He was the Word then, that was feeding them then. Moses told them the Truth; but, you see, they always make a denomination out of it, for the vultures to... There is some of It left after the eagles has done eat and gone home. Then they're waiting to see something else. \"The Word,\" they say, \"here It's supposed to come. We had caribou yesterday; we have sheep tomorrow.\" See what I mean? \"There is old caribou carcase down there, gloating, but we got sheep coming today. Where's it at?\" See what I mean? Angels' Food! The people that eat manna one day, if they tried to keep it over for the next day, it got contaminated. Don't you see all the types, how perfect? Same now! [Exodus 16:20]\n\nL-229 Notice, the vultures of Jesus' day was also casting out devils; anointed ones on the old carcase. Is that right? They were casting out devils. Jesus said so. And remember, they had prophets in those days. Caiaphas, the high priest, prophesied. How many knows that? Caiaphas prophesied. Notice the position of the weed in the field; it's watered by the same anointing. Why did the Bible say he prophesied? \"Because he was high priest that year.\" A rotten scavenger, a weed and a thistle, setting among the Wheat; but the Spirit was upon him, the genuine Holy Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit of God was upon him, to preach, prophesy, and foretell it to come to pass; and denied and crucified the very vindicated Word of the hour. [John 18:14] Oh, mercy, brother! How much longer do we have to say these things, see, how much more through the Scripture? I'll hurry. I got about ten pages here, of Scriptures, how proving all things. \"The sun on the just and the unjust, the same.\" [John 11:51]\n\nL-230 Jesus said, to prove this. \"If I cast out devils by the finger of God, by who does your children cast them out?\" Now, they were casting out devils. They were prophesying. Is that right? But did not recognize Him being the Word of the hour, (why?) because He wasn't associated with them. Now take Matthew 24:24, \"False Christs,\" anointed ones, \"will rise, and there'll be false prophets prophesying it,\" see, \"and will deceive the very Elected if it was possible.\" You got it now? [Matthew 24:24], [Luke 11:20]\n\nL-231 Notice the children. \"Who does the children... If I cast out devils by the Word of God,\" which, He was the Word of God, \"who does your denominational children cast them out by?\" Now, and God alone can cast out a devil, we know that, God alone. For, the strong man has to be stronger than the one in his house. They had power to do it. You know, in the Revelations there, said he'd... that antichrist that raised in the last days, \"Done signs and wonders, that even deceived those that dwelled upon the face of the earth, and deceived every one of them, Christians and all, whose names were not written in the Lambs Book of Life,\" answer to Matthew 24:24, \"whose names were not written in the Lambs Book of Life from the foundation of the world.\" [Revelation 17:8], [Revelation 20:12-15] That Life that was in the root of that--of that genuine orange tree, that come up through all those citrus and everything else, and passed on and put the fruit in top of the tree, above all the denominational grafts and branches. You got it? I'll hurry. The strong man... [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-232 Remember David now, he was honest, sincere, trying to do God a work, and wasn't ordained to do it. \"They,\" the anointed ones; but Jesus said, \"They're teaching for Doctrine the interpretation (of the Scriptures) of man,\" see, not the Word of God, not His vindicated Word; teaching a historical Christ, see, something that was. And the Bible said, \"He is.\" \"I AM,\" not \"I was or will be.\" \"I AM, right now.\" He's that Word that lives through here. He was, in the beginning, He was in the... He was in the--the blades; He was in the tassel; He was in the shuck; but now He's in the Grain. [Matthew 15:9], [Mark 7:7], [Exodus 3:14]\n\nL-233 Now, you go back and try to live again? What if that Life took back down, you think that (left) Life would ever 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min talk, go back after that old shuck is dried up, ever go back and live in it again? It never does. \"For it is impossible for those which were once enlightened,\" and didn't move on with the Word as it come to pass, \"they are dead, gone; and the thorns and thistles which is nigh unto rejection, whose end is to be burned.\" Is that right? Now hurrying just as quick as I can. [Hebrews 6:4], [Hebrews 6:8]\n\nL-234 Notice the Scripture now. Teaching a historical God, see, just like they're trying to live in the past, like, \"Well, Wesley said so-and-so. Or, So-and-so said so-and-so.\" You're refusing the promised Word of the day, the Manna that's clearly identified of the day. They try to put their old Lutheran, Baptist, Pentecostal wines in our new bottles. It don't work. And our new Wine, in their old bottles, won't work. If they try to put this new Wine in the denomination, their folly is made manifest. They can't do it. It blows her up.\n\nL-235 \"Now, brother, I seen the Word of God, perfectly by the Word!\" \"Now, look here, doctor, if... We--we can't have That. Ned, I think you've had some of that lately. \"We, we just can't have That here now. I--I would rather that you maybe just go on.\" You know. See, it won't work. It blows up. \"You don't put a new piece of garment in an old garment, 'cause you make it all rent.\" See? Didn't Jesus say that? You can't put new Wine in old bottles. It blows them up. The new Wine has got Life in it. All right. [Matthew 9:16, 17]\n\nL-236 Notice here something, real quick now, while we're ending the... our talk. Notice Revelation 16:13 to 14, if you want to put that down. I won't have time maybe to go to it. I want you to be sure and see it. Now notice, this is the sounding between the Sixth and Seventh Vial. [Revelation 16:13-14]\n\nL-237 Now we'll--we'll close out just in a minute, if you can just bear a few minutes longer. Closing out now.\n\nL-238 Notice Revelation 16:13 to 14, between the Sixth and Seventh Vial, \"Three unclean spirits like frogs\" (did you notice that?) \"went out of the mouth of someone.\" Now notice, quickly. Are you ready? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] A trinity of spirits! [Revelation 16:13, 14]\n\nL-239 Now denominational brother, set still just a minute. Don't get up and walk out of the room, back out there on this radio, telephone hook-up. Don't turn your tape recorder off. Set still just a minute, and listen. You're born of God, you will.\n\nL-240 A trinity of frogs! A frog is an animal that always looks backward. He never looks where he's going; he looks where he's come from. See? Don't you see? Where was trinitarianism born at? Remember, \"three unclean spirits,\" individual spirits. Are you getting it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-241 Notice, they look back to the Nicaea Council where the trinity doctrine was born at, not in the Bible. There's no such a thing. They look back to the Nicaea Council at Nicaea, Rome, where the trinity was born at. Notice where they come from. Notice. And the trinity of frogs came out of an old trinity, give birth to a new trinity, their mother. What'd it come out of? A trinity, \"the dragon,\" see, \"the beast,\" and \"the false prophet.\" A trinity, new. For when were these frogs come out? When did it? Notice, they was there all the time, but it wasn't manifested until between the Sixth and Seventh Vial, just before the Seals opened to reveal it. \"For in the Message of the seventh angel, the mysteries of God would be known,\" all these trinitarian things, and false baptisms, and everything was to be made manifest. God help us to see what's Truth! And not think it's somebody trying to say something to... [Revelation 10:7]\n\nL-242 I feel that spirit resenting That, you see. I'm not speaking of myself, brother. I'm speaking of the Angel of the Lord that's in the camp. That's exactly right.\n\nL-243 Notice, a trinity! \"The dragon,\" how many knows what the dragon was? It was Rome. \"And the dragon stood before the woman to devour her child as soon as it was born.\" That right? What does \"beast\" mean in the Bible? Power. All right. \"False prophet, a false prophet,\" a false, anointed one. See? [Revelation 12:3-5]\n\nL-244 Started where? This is \"false prophet,\" singular. \"False prophet,\" the first pope; and from there come out \"the--the whore, and the mother of harlots,\" the whole thing. A false trinity was rising; not in the early days, wouldn't be made manifest in the early days, it went right on through with it. But when the Seven Seals be come, and opened those mysteries and revealed them; that's when \"the frogs, three 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min unclean spirits like frogs, come out to manifest themselves,\" a trinity doctrine against the Truth. See? Huh! See where it come from? See where it's going back to? Ecumenical Council. They're all brothers, anyhow; same spirits, same thing. And watch. So deceiving, performing miracles! And these are devils that go forth to all the gods of the earth, working miracles, to deceive them in the last day, and will succeed in doing it. What did God say about that evil spirit? Said, \"I'll go down and get in the mouth of those prophets and cause them to prophesy a lie, to cause Ahab to come out there to be destroyed.\" [Jeremiah 29:21], [II Chronicles 18:21-22]\n\nL-245 God said, \"Go. You will succeed. You will get them to believe it. They're not on that Word, to begin with.\" See? \"Go, for you will persuade him. You'll be the one will do it, when you get in them false prophets, 'cause he's relying right on them. And he don't know nothing about the Word, neither will he try to learn about It. He can't do it, because he's a thistle, to begin with.\" See? See? \"You'll succeed.\"\n\nL-246 Look here at these false frogs, looking back, \"Why, you know what they said back there at Nicaea?\" I don't care what they said about, there at Nicaea. I'm saying what they said up here at the Throne of God; what would be, not what was; what will be, for He is \"I AM.\" See? \"False.\" Look at that. Huh! Notice where they come from.\n\nL-247 Now listen closely. We see plainly, after the Seven Seals has been opened, that's to reveal that mystery. What is that trinity? See? Where was it ever called trinity? See? Where in the Bible did It even speak the word trinity? Where could there be three Gods, that we worship three Gods and not be heathens? How can they be separate, when He said, \"I and My Father are One\"? \"Except you believe that I am He, you'll perish in your sin, see, your unbelief.\" Sin is unbelief. \"You'll perish in your unbelief.\" Oh, who do you say that I am, from whence did you say that I came, Oh, do you know My Father, or can you tell His Name? I AM the Rose of Sharon, the Bright and Morning Star. Can you tell me Who He is? I AM that spoke to Moses in the burning bush of Fire, I AM the God of Abraham, the Bright and Morning Star. I AM the Rose of Sharon, oh, whence did you say that I came; Oh, do you know My Father, or can you tell His Name? (Amen!) I AM Alpha, Omega, the Beginning from the End; I AM the whole creation, and Jesus is His Name.\n\nL-248 That's right. No trinity! No, sir. That's a false thing. The Seven Seals, opening those mysteries that \"should be finished,\" shows up. Seal opened; disposes, shows up, makes plain the hidden Truths that the Seals had hid all these years, through all those churches and denominations. \"The great whore,\" of Revelation seven-... Who was she? But she is \"THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS,\" also. See? [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-249 \"Now, you called them 'vultures,'\" you say, \"Brother Branham.\" That's right. But, remember, a vulture is a bird. He is anointed to fly, also. \"The two spirits be so close it'd deceive the Elected...\" A vulture is as big as a--as an eagle. He could fly like that eagle; and is anointed to fly, or to preach, or to prophesy, notice, as same as the eagle. But he can't follow the eagle in height. No, no. If he tries to follow the eagle, his follies will be made manifest. Yes, sir. He can't follow the eagle. Oh, he can say, \"I believe in Jesus Christ being the Son of God. I believe God the Father, Almighty, Creator of heavens and earth; Jesus Christ His Son, and so forth.\" Oh, sure, they can do that. But what about Him being the same yesterday, today, and forever? See? [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-250 A eagle is a special-built bird. There is nothing like him, on the earth. See? He--he... If a buzzard try to follow him, or any other bird, he would disintegrate. His follies would be made manifest, sure enough. He would blow up when he'd try to put the new Wine in an old bottle. See, he would blow up. He would disintegrate. He ain't made, he 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min ain't... His body isn't put together with the structure to hold him up there. When he gets in them great spheres up yonder, if he wasn't made, ordained, predestinated, born eagle, he'll bust to pieces. See? The feathers would fly out of his wings, and he'd fall to the earth. Sure. He can't follow the eagle, in height. If he tries to, his folly will be made manifest. That's right. You can't.\n\nL-251 Why? He can't see like the eagle. What good does it do to try to jump real high, and can't see where you're at when you're up there? And if he should try, even try to impersonate this eagle, in heights, he becomes so blind he don't know what he's worked up to. That's right. He is screaming and shouting, and carrying on; but just speak the Word to him, boy, there his folly is made known.\n\nL-252 Talk to him about the baptism in the Name of Jesus Christ, or, Him being the same yesterday, today, and ever, all--all like that, and tell him. \"Why, oh, now wait just a minute!\" See? Oh, yeah, there his feathers are dropping. See, he's all jumped up, and prophesy, and casting out devils, and speaking in tongues, and shouting, and carrying on, running up-and-down the floor. But don't try to follow up There; why, he'll sure be made known.\n\nL-253 Yet, he's ordained. He's anointed. He can fly. He can balance hisself, get up there, but not... just so far. See, he can eat a carrion, but he can't eat the fresh Meat that comes from the Throne. He is blind. He is all worked up, but he don't know what he's worked up about. See, that same Spirit that fell upon him, like the rain, to make him a wheat; he's not a wheat to begin with. He blows up. \"Oh, I can't go for some... Oh, no, sir! I know Doctor Jones said...\" All right, go ahead. See? Go ahead, if you want to. [Acts 2:38], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-254 No, notice, he is not born, or built, or predestinated, to be that kind of a bird. He can... He's a... might be a lemon growing on an orange tree, but he never come from the roots. He's something that's been added. And when they get so high in their denominations that they can't see the predestinated Word of God vindicated, then their folly is made known. \"Oh, that stuff, Halo over head, and all, oh, It's nonsense.\" See? Made known.\n\nL-255 He is not built to see that far. He can only see as far as his denominational glasses will let him look. But, after that, he's as blind as a bat. It's then his folly is made known. See? That's where the true eagle sets down to eat. Yes, sir. That's where the true, elected eagles sees what he is. When he can't take that Word, they know right then he's a denominational vulture.\n\nL-256 Why, why can't he fly? Cause, look what he's been eating on. He's been eating on rotten denominational carrion. That won't--that won't spiritualize his body, won't put him in spiritual fitness, in other words, to carry him up above the denominational differences. See? See, he's just fed on rotten stuff; his body is made out of that. He can't go up there where that fresh Meat carries that eagle. He just can't do it. See?\n\nL-257 That fulfills Matthew 24:24. He's flying, jumping up in the air, flopping his wings, but he just can't get high enough. See? That's right. See, he can't go, he can't reach high enough to get that fresh Manna. He can eat the old manna that's down here on the ground, the old dead rabbits that's been run over a week ago, and a month ago, or forty years ago, contamination. He can eat that, and just gloat over it, and squawk and holler, and carry on, jump up and fly like another eagle. He's anointed, like another bird. And he is a type of an eagle, a buzzard is. We know that. He sure is, but he can't follow that genuine eagle. See? He just can't do it. No, sir. His body isn't built; he's been eating on different carrion, see, and it won't be... it won't--it won't be the fresh Meat, the fresh Manna. It'd be something that Luther said, Wesley said, or Doctor So-and-so said. It won't be on what Jesus said for this hour. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-258 Let's go now, close. Anointed ones, \"Christs,\" in the last days, but the \"false teachers and false prophet.\" Notice how striking! Now I want you to compare this; we haven't got time to read it out, Matthew 24:24 with Second Timothy 3:8. Matthew 24:24 said, in the last days, see, \"There'll come false Christs,\" false, anointed ones, \"false prophets, and shall show signs and wonders,\" exactly like the real One--real One, \"and shall--and shall almost deceive the very Elected.\" Now notice, that was Jesus speaking. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-259 Here come Paul, right behind Him, and said, \"Now, in the last days, there will come religious people, see, having 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min a form of godliness. And lead silly women, led away with all kinds of worldly lusts.\" And they wonder, say, \"Why do you pick on them women?\" Oh, for goodness... They just don't even see It. \"Lead silly women, laden with divers lusts,\" away from things like at... of the... See, \"And as Jannes and Jambres...\" Matthew 24:24, \"false Christs,\" false, anointed, doing signs and wonders to deceive the Elected. \"Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so will these reprobates; reprobate mind concerning the Faith.\" Not \"a\" faith. \"The Faith!\" \"One Faith, one Lord, one bap-...\" You can't have \"one Faith\" without believing in \"one Lord.\" You can't have two baptisms, and not one for the Father, and Son, the Holy Ghost. \"One baptism,\" Jesus Christ. That's right. See, false baptism! [II Timothy 3:8], [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-260 Notice, compare them together now when you get home. Notice Matthew 24:24, Jesus speaking; Paul, Second Timothy 3:8; many others. And now compare that. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-261 And then put another Scripture, Luke 17:30, Malachi 4. \"As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses,\" the anointed Word of the hour, \"so will these men,\" not man, \"men,\" anointed ones, \"resist the Truth.\" [II Timothy 3:8]\n\nL-262 \"In the very day that the Son of man is revealed.\" Revelations 10:1 to 7, read it when you get home, \"the seventh angel's Message, opening up the Seals.\" What is it? Not the angel is the Son of man; but the messenger is revealing the Son of man. Can you get it separated now? That's where it seems to be so hard for you, you see. Not the Son of man, Himself; but the seventh angel, the seventh messenger, is revealing to the public the Son of man, because It's left the shuck. He can't organize It. It's the Grain, Itself, again. \"And in that day, Jannes and Jambres will withstand,\" anointed ones (make-believers and unbelievers, the church formal and the Pentecostals) stand up against the true Grain, \"but let them alone; their folly will be made manifest, as theirs was.\" See? You understand now? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-263 Revelations 10, said, \"In the days of the sounding of the seventh angel.\" Now remember, seventh, Laodicea Church Age. \"The sounding of that angel,\" when that church age is done denominated and become a church age, when it's done in its Pentecostal organization; when the messenger to that... What was each messenger? What was Martin Luther? A rebuke to the Catholic. What was Wesley? A rebuke to them Lutherans. What was the Pentecost? A rebuke to them others. Where has the Life gone now? Away from an organization. No more shuck; it's the Grain. What is it? A rebuke to the Pentecost, see, to fulfill the Scripture of this hour. See? [Revelation 10:7]\n\nL-264 Notice, the very day when this messenger... Not when he starts on, but when he begins to declare his Message. See? The First Pull, healing; Second Pull, prophesying; Third Pull, the opening of the Word, the mysteries revealed. No more, there is no more higher order to reveal the Word, than prophets. But the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the Word. And, remember, the Third Pull was the opening of them Seven Seals, to reveal the hidden Truth that's been sealed in the Word. Do you see it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] It is then, in that day when this thing is to take place, that Jannes and Jambres, the impersonators, will appear again. Just like they did when Moses appeared with the original Word, to say It; they appear to impersonate It. Just exactly right. Now you see what Matthew 24:24 is? See, anointed ones! [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-265 Now there's three things we're going to say before we close. This is it. I want you to listen real close now as we close. Three things, remember, three things have been fulfilled. Three things lays before you right now.\n\nL-266 First. The world is in a Sodom condition. Jesus said it would happen. Look at the perversion; our women trying to act like man; our man trying to act like women, sissyfied; rotten, filthy, low-down, devil-possessed, and don't know it. The Bible said that would happen, and that's where it's at. [II Timothy 3:2-4]\n\nL-267 Secondly. It's in that hour, according to the Scripture here, that Jannes and Jambres appears. Secondly.\n\nL-268 Thirdly. It's in that same hour that the Son of man is to be revealed. [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-269 There is your believer, your make-believer, and your unbeliever. There is a genuine Word standing out, 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min vindicated; there is the make-believer impersonating It; and there is the unbeliever rejecting the whole thing. But it shall be Light about the evening time, The way to Glory you will surely find. (That right?) Nations are breaking, Israel is awakening, The signs that our Bible foretold; And the Gentile days numbered (Sodom), with harrows encumbered; Return, O dispersed, to your own. The day of redemption is near, Man's hearts are failing, in this fear; Be filled with God's Spirit, have your lamps trimmed and clear, (so you can see the Word of the hour,) Look up, your redemption is near! False prophets are lying, (they said they'd be here; anointed ones), God's Truth they're denying, That Jesus the Christ is our God. That's, they don't believe It. The Bible said there would be that thing here. Here it is! But we'll walk where the apostles have trod. (Same Light! \"And restore the Faith of the fathers to the children.\") The day of redemption is near, so near, Man's hearts are failing for fear, (the earth is dropping in); Oh, be filled with God's Spirit, have your lamps trimmed and clear. Look up, your redemption is near. You believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Let us bow our heads then.\n\nL-270 Out into the land where this Message is going, from the East Coast to the West, from California to New York, down into the South, up into the North, out into the missions, and wherever It's going, and in this tabernacle. We are poor. We don't have these great, big, flowerly things, and television casts. We're just trying to do the best we can. \"But all that the Father has given Me will come.\" [John 6:37]\n\nL-271 Now, I want you to know this is sure, and you that listen to this tape. You might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself, being that I was packing this Message. I have no more to do with It than nothing, no more than just a voice. And, my voice, even against my better judgment; I wanted to be a trapper. But it's the will of my Father that I declare to do, and determined to do. I wasn't the One that appeared down on the river; I was only standing there when He appeared. I'm not the One that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect they are; I'm only one that's near when He does it. I was only a voice that He used, to say It. It wasn't what I knew; it's what I just surrendered myself to, that He spoke through. It isn't me, it wasn't the seventh angel, oh, no; it was the manifestation of the Son of man. It wasn't the angel, his message; it was the mystery that God unfolded. It's not a man; it's God. The angel was not the Son of man; he was the messenger from the Son of man. The Son of man is Christ; He is the One that you're feeding on. You're not feeding on a man; a man, his words will fail. But you're feeding on the unfailing Body-Word of the Son of man.\n\nL-272 If you haven't fed fully on every Word, to give yourself strength to fly above all these denominations and things of the world, will you at this time do it, while we pray?\n\nL-273 Dear Father, this is a hard thing. It is not easy for a mortal to do it. Thou knowest all things. And I pray Thee, dear God, that it will not be misunderstood. But, in the Light of Your Word, may the people walk.\n\nL-274 And, Father God, I don't know who the Elected is; Thou knowest. I don't know when Your Coming is. But I only know that You said when this takes place, these false, anointed ones; not right when they started. Moses just let them alone, for he could do no more about it. He could only say what You were saying. You told him to call fleas; then they called them. You told him to turn the water to blood; then they did it. Moses only carried out, Word by Word, as You said, but then You was the One Who made the folly manifested. [Exodus 7:19-20]\n\nL-275 Now, Father, You are God, yet. The same Word said that this would happen in the last days. Many honest person, 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min as we said last Sunday, putting their hand to that Ark upon a new cart, and not the shoulders of the Levites, has fell dead, \"dead in sin and trespasses,\" argue against their own conscience.\n\nL-276 Many ministers setting in his study, read that Word, and change the page quick; to keep from having to blast out, to know he'll lose his social standing with the public, with his church and with his denomination. God help us to never do that!\n\nL-277 Cleanse our heart, Lord, from all filth of the world. Lord, I stand ready for cleansing. I stand ready, with this church and with all the listening in, and whoever will listen to this tape. I stand, Lord, and ask for cleansing. Lord, take me to the potter's house and break me up, mold me a servant that You'd want. For, Lord Jesus, \"I'm a man of unclean lips,\" as Isaiah cried, \"dwelling with people of unclean lips; and woe is me, for I see the revelation of God being made manifest,\" as Isaiah saw the Angels in the Temple. I see the end time, Lord, and woe is me and my family; woe is me and my people. O Eternal God, have mercy upon us. I plead for myself and the people. Let us not perish with those who believe not, but may we live with the believers.\n\nL-278 Every denomination, Lord, every man or woman... I can't ask You to bless a denomination, when I know You're against it. But I can only say, Lord, if You have any of Your sheep out among them, may they hear this tape. May they hear It, Lord, and understand It with the understanding You'll give them, and may they come out and receive You. May they not be deceived by the blindness and tradition of this day. May they not to try to eat something that... or it was a carcase in another day. May they take the Word. That's the way the Pharisees crucified You, Lord. They were taking the carcase of Moses' day, and trying to gloat over it; after You had given the type, in the wilderness, of fresh manna each night, meaning each generation. That's where they failed. It poisoned them. It killed them, to eat that contaminated food. And, spiritually, it does the same thing today; kill them, spiritually, with a denomination. Help us, dear God. It's all in Your hands now. In Jesus Christ's Name. [Matthew 15:3, 6]\n\nL-279 With our heads bowed, we're going to sing that while you make your decision. Will you go all the way? I can hear my Sav-... (and He is the Word)... -ior calling, I can hear... \"Oh, I've wandered a long time, but, really, right now I hear Him, 'Come unto Me, all ye that's groping along.' Hear, 'Take up your cross, follow Me daily.' 'Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I'll fear no evil; down through the shady green pastures, and by the still waters.'\" And where He leads me I... \"Lord, I see that trinitarian folly. I see the whole world sowed in it; weeds growing everywhere. But where You lead me now, Lord, I'll be like those in Acts 19. 'When they heard This, they were rebaptized in the Name of Jesus Christ.'\" ... follow, (\"I've went part of the way, Lord, enough to receive You.\") Now I'll go with Him all the way. [Brother Branham begins to hum Where He Leads Me--Ed.] [Matthew 11:28], [Psalms 23:3, 4], [Acts 19:5]\n\nL-280 Dear God, I trust that that come from my heart. I trust that it come from everyone's heart that's a singing at this time, maybe many who will hear this tape, that's not present or not hearing it now. May we be willing, Lord, regardless of the price. Said, \"Like a man going to meet another army, a soldier, a king; first he sets down and counts, is he able to do it, can he give up the things of the world? Can you give up, join up in the army of God's written Word; march with His soldiers, fly with His eagles?\" Grant it, Lord, in Jesus' Name.\n\nL-281 You believe? You accept Him? All right. We'll see you here again, tonight, the Lord willing. Do you believe that to be the Truth? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Is it plain enough? [\"Amen. ] Then take the Name of Jesus with you, Child of sorrow and of woe; It will joy and comfort give you, Take it every-... Now, shake hands with somebody by you now. Precious Name, O how sweet! 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min Hope of earth, the hope of earth, joy of Heaven; Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven. At the Name of Jesus bowing, Falling prostrate at His feet, King of kings in Heaven we'll crown... (He is God, then) When our journey is complete. Precious Name, precious Name, O how sweet! O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven; Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven.\n\nL-282 I suppose that all the ministers was made known this morning, recognized. When a man has prayed all week, wondering what, seeing these Scriptures, them standing right out before you. \"Woe unto me,\" said Paul, \"if I preach not the Gospel.\" At the end of his road, he said, \"I have not shunned to declare to you the whole Counsel of God as It was given to me.\" [I Corinthians 9:16], [Acts 20:27]\n\nL-283 I forget sometimes to recognize things, presenting, to dedicate the babies. Billy said, the other day, a man come, said, \"I been coming here for two years, get my baby dedicated.\" Billy said, \"Don't think bad about that. I've got a baby, a year old, and he ain't been dedicated yet, either. So I'm just going to wait till he gets old enough to walk up there himself, I guess.\"\n\nL-284 So we find brother, sister, it's not--it's not, see, I... One thing, we should dedicate our children. We should baptize every one. There's a pool; here is water. If you haven't been, what hinders thee? Here is water. Come right now. Don't wait till tonight; come right now. There is man standing here will baptize anybody that's repented and made confession. If you been baptized a dozen times, they'll baptize you in the Name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin. See? We have that.\n\nL-285 But, see, the Message is on my heart. I must get It out. That's my sole purpose, regardless of what my wife says, my children says, my pastor says, my whatever says. It's my Lord. I must get That out. That's my sole purpose.\n\nL-286 And now, many times, I forget to recognize the ministers. I guess maybe... our brother, Brother Neville, a precious man. These other brethren here, we're happy to have you.\n\nL-287 Not that we disagree with you, brother, to be different. Many of you here might be trinitarian preachers. We don't want to be angry with you. We love you. If we didn't, if I didn't believe that, I'd never leave this church till I got down there on my knees and said, \"God, make me right.\" I don't want that arrogant, selfish spirit mixed up with mine. I want my spirit to be pure and clean, brotherly love, holy with the Holy Spirit. Now, if someone does anything wrong to me, that's all right. And though I might have the right to get back at them, I don't want that in my life. No, I--I want to have love. I want to be ready to correct with love, with love that absolutely answers out yonder for it.\n\nL-288 I don't mean to be different. Methodist, Baptist, Catholic, Presbyterian, whoever you are, I don't say these things to be different, be arrogant with you. If I did, I'm a hypocrite and should be down here at this altar, praying through to God. But I say it, it's because of love, and I see where you're going. Now, I don't say this in myself, and saying I'm presuming. I give you THUS SAITH THE LORD. That is the Truth. And I love you for those things. God bless you.\n\nL-289 Now as we sing another verse of this song, let's, before we go. We want you to be here tonight, if you can. If you can't, God be with you till we meet. We just pray that God will--will bless you and give you the best of His land, see. Take the Name of Jesus... 65-0725M, The Anointed Ones At The End Time, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 193 min Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

Our Lord God, great Creator of Heavens and earth, Who brought again Jesus from the dead, and alive with us for these two thousand years, ever living to confirm His Word and make It true to each generation. We are so thankful for His Divine Presence just now, knowing this, that we have this great assurance, that after this life is over, we have Life Eternal in the world that is to come. Thank You, for this, Lord. And that hope, a anchor to the soul, that's steadfast and sure in time of storm. And when the storms come, the great waves a-rolling, we feel that by faith in Him we can caress every wave. [Genesis 1:1]\n\nL-2 God, help us tonight as we come to minister to the sick and the needy. We pray, God, that there will not be a sick person among us when we leave tonight. May every person be healed by Thy Divine Power, both here and across the nation, of the hookup, may there not be a feeble person go out of any building or any gathering tonight. May Your Spirit heal them. Let the great Sun of righteousness, with healing in His wings, rise, send forth the rays of faith in every heart as they listen to the Word, see the manifestations of the Holy Spirit convincing them that He is still alive. We pray these blessings, Father, in Jesus' Name. Amen. You may be seated.\n\nL-3 We certainly deem this a grand privilege to be here tonight, again, to--to speak to the people and pray for the sick. We want to greet all those who are out in the land of the--the telephone connections across the nation, again tonight. And so we pray that God will bless each one of you, trusting that all that accepted Christ this morning will be filled with the Holy Ghost and ever live faithful and true to Him until life is over here on earth, this mortal life. And then they, by doing that, they have Eternal Life. They will never die in the age that is to come, to the great Age that we all look forward to. [Acts 2:38], [Galatians 5:1, 16-17]\n\nL-4 Now we're going to say, while I'm thinking of it, not to interrupt. Brother Vayle is here, and I might not get to see him. I'll... Can I send that manuscript on to you when I get back to Tucson? I'm looking it over, haven't got it all read yet, and I'll send it back to you as soon as I get to Tucson.\n\nL-5 Now I am wanting to make an announcement. This is especially to the churches everywhere, especially in the West, or anywhere that wants to come. Our noble brother, Brother Pearry Green, with the... It's a man that's instigator of this hookup of this telephone here. The Lord has been putting it upon his heart to come visit us at Tucson, and start a revival at Tucson, which we really need. And Brother Pearry will be in Tucson. If you want to contact him, just get a hold of our office there. It'll be August the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th. He's had it upon his heart for a long time, and I told him there's \"only way get it off your heart, go do it.\" And he's a Christian brother, a real servant of God. And you people, in Tucson, I know will be blessed as he ministers there somewhere, perhaps at the Ramada Inn or wherever the Lord provides a place, he hasn't got it on here. But I know you'll be blessed by coming, hearing Brother Green as he expounds to us the Word of God, perhaps praying for the sick, or whatever it lays in the duty of God's anointing to do.\n\nL-6 We also want to thank Brother Orman Neville, Brother Mann, for this wonderful time of fellowship with them. How I'm very grateful to have, be associated with such man as Brother Neville, Brother Mann, and all these other ministers around here. I suppose they been recognized. If you haven't, by our board and our church here, I'm sure that God recognizes you here as His servants. May the Lord ever bless you.\n\nL-7 Now, I was asked a little something here, on a little note was given me, to... They had a trustee meeting the other night here, on the board of trustees and deacons, and I think the minutes were read this morning before the church. Which, that's custom for us to do that. In the decisions that was made by the board of trustees and deacons here in the church, of course, it can't please everyone. We cannot do that. I have not one thing to do with the trustee board or the deacon board. I have not even a vote unless there's a tie, and I have to be here to do it then, Brother Orman Neville takes that second vote. Then we have to sign these, because we're part of the church. But what the trustee board and them boards' decision they make, we certainly stand behind them one hundred percent, 'cause that's what they're here 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min for. And their decisions is between them and God. I cannot, cannot and would not, by any means, contrary that decision. And another thing, I am forbidden by the United States Government to make any decision concerning that, so please don't ask me to correct their decisions. I cannot do it, and I will not hear nothing about it. See? So don't ask me to correct their decisions. You see the board, that's the one that made the decisions. All right.\n\nL-8 Now in the event of a coming meeting, it is possible, if the Lord willing, I'll be coming back here in about four to six weeks, or something like that, for maybe another Sunday's meeting. And I announced this morning I wanted to speak on God Manifested In His Word, and I just won't have time tonight, and, frankly, I haven't hardly got enough voice to do it. And then the crowd, there is almost as many on the outside as there is on the inside, and, perhaps more, counting those buses and trucks and things that's sitting out there with the people. Turned on, the little broadcast has stepped up a little, we can hear it. This little wave, short wave from the tabernacle, we can pick that up a city block away. And some of the cars are several city blocks away, the lines of car, up and down, and around and through the streets, around the tabernacle tonight. I don't believe at anytime, visibly, we've ever had more people jammed in and around the church than we have tonight. So we are... And many, many, many are just driving up and driving away.\n\nL-9 So it goes to show, \"Where the Carcase is, the eagles will gather.\"And may I say to you tonight, in this little group of people, it's a international gathering. Practically over two thirds of the states of the union is represented here, besides five foreign nations, even to Russia, and all over the different parts of the country. Way down into Venezuela, out into Jamaica, all over the different parts of the nation, people are here, hungering and thirsting for God. What a marvelous time! [Matthew 24:28]\n\nL-10 Now I want, before reading the Bible, and will you pray for me now. I--I'm going to try to bring a little Message, the Lord willing, on the appropriation of Divine healing. For, this morning we talked on salvation. And tonight we're going to speak a few minutes on Divine healing, and then call the prayer line and pray for the people. While we're doing this, out on the hookups, wherever you are, even out in the buses and cars around, within a block or two of the tabernacle; when it comes time to pray for the sick, if you can't get into the building... Which, you cannot, I'm sure now, 'cause doorways everywhere is jammed tight, past, and no room nowhere, so you pray and lay your hands on one another out there. And let each minister who is hooked in tonight, also pray for his congregation while the healing services are going on. We believe that God is omnipresent, everywhere. Now before we read or...\n\nL-11 Before we--we pray, we want to read some of God's Word. And I changed my--my Scriptures a while ago, because wanting to change the type of meeting that I had set in my mind for tonight, so I have changed it a little bit; and so I had to change my Scriptures, not change them, but set them in another order, of Divine healing, so that--that people would understand. Let's turn to Saint Luke, the 24th chapter. And we will begin at the 12th verse of the 24th chapter, and read down to about 34. It's on the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Then Peter, arose Peter, and ran to the sepulchre; and stooping down, and he beheld the linen clothes... wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. And, behold, two of them went the same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. Now, it takes ten furlongs to make a--to make a mile, so it was about six miles. And as they talked together of... these things which had happened. ...it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as you walk, and are sad? And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered saying unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and has not thou known these things which are come to pass... in these days? And he said unto them, What things? Now remember, this is Jesus Himself, risen, talking. 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and in word before God and all the people: ...how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to the... to be--to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that he had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said... he was alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. Listen now; Jesus. Then said he unto them, O fools,... slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to entered into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them all, in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. And they drew nigh unto the village, where they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is towards evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and give it to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sights. And they said one to the other, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and when they were with them, Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared unto Simon. And they told what things were done in the way, and how that he was known to them by breaking of bread. [Luke 24:12-35]\n\nL-12 Now let us pray. Dear gracious Father, we thank Thee for Thy Word, for Thy Word is Truth, Thy Word is Life. And Thou, O Lord, and Thy Word are One. So we pray tonight, Lord, that You will come among us in the power of Your resurrection and will show forth to us tonight, like those that came from Emmaus, that we too would return to our homes, saying, \"Did not our hearts burn within us?\" Grant it, Lord, it's towards evening time again. For we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. [John 17:17], [Luke 24:32]\n\nL-13 Now I want to speak concerning this Bible. And my subject tonight, for the topic, is: Events Made Clear By Prophecy. Events Made Clear By Prophecy.\n\nL-14 Now, the Bible is a different Book from all other sacred books. The Bible is a different Book. It is a Book of prophecy, foretelling future events. And It's also the Revelation of Jesus Christ. All the way from Genesis to Revelation, brings Him out in His fullness, what He was and is. And the whole complete Book, Revelations 1:1 to 3, said the Book is a Book of \"The Revelation of Jesus Christ,\" which is the Word of God. \"The Revelation of Jesus Christ,\" the Word of God! [Revelation 1:1-3]\n\nL-15 Now, all other books, sacred books, is only a code of ethics, a code of morals, or a code of theology. Something that... How many ever read the Koran, the Mohammedan Bible, and--and the book of on Buddhists, and so forth? It's just a code of ethics, what people should live, how they should live, but it doesn't prophesy, doesn't say anything about these things or about any special gifts being given to anybody, anything to take place. Just like joining a lodge or something. Therefore, when churches come to the place that they make their church just a lodge to join, then they're 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min plumb off the Word of God.\n\nL-16 For the Bible is a living, foretold witness of Jesus Christ. And as the earth has growed into its fullness, and also vines grow into their fullness, the day grows into its fullness, the Bible was manifested in Its fullness in the Person of Jesus Christ. He was the Word of God revealed, the whole complete Book of Redemption. The Bible is God's Word, forthtelling the future events. Its believers is commanded by Its Author to read and believe every Word of It, not just part of It. One Word, to disbelieve It, you might as well quit trying until you believe that Word. Every Word is absolutely a part of Almighty God; God made manifest, wound into His Word, to show forth Who He is. We are commanded, as believers, to believe every Word of It. And It's wrote by the Author of God Himself. There is nobody can add anything to It or take anything from It. If you would, it would be a freak body of God. It would have, maybe like six fingers on one hand, or--or three arms, or something, to add something, to take something away from it and be one arm short, one finger short. It's the complete Body of Jesus Christ. And in Christ, being the Male, the Groom, the Bride is represented in Him also. And these two are One. \"At that day you'll know that I am in the Father, the Father in Me, I in you and you in Me.\" What a complete picture! [John 17:21]\n\nL-17 And the true believers in this Word, who accept It that way, believe It, and with patience wait for Its prophesied promises, every one of them to be manifested in its age. Every believer has watched for it. Every believer that's been on the toes, watching, is the one that's been revealed to.\n\nL-18 Now look in the days of the coming of the Lord Jesus. Why didn't those people recognize John, when the Bible plainly said by Isaiah, \"There will be a voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord'\"? Their last prophet they had, which is Malachi 3, said, \"Behold, I send My messenger before My face to prepare the way.\" Why didn't they see it? Because they was looking upon something that had been done, basing their thoughts upon some message that had went forth beforehand, and failed to see the present manifestation of God in the day they were living. [Malachi 3:1]\n\nL-19 And Christians, everywhere, that's exactly where the world stands tonight. Without contradiction, that's the truth! Christians, everywhere, are trying to look back to some code of ethics that Mr. Luther wrote, or Mr. Wesley, Sankey, Finney, Knox, Calvin; which, none of us can speak evil of, but that was in a day past.\n\nL-20 The Pharisees looked back to see what Moses said, and they said, \"We have Moses. We don't know whence Thou comest.\"\n\nL-21 But remember, when Moses here, they didn't know whence he cometh. See? And now they... No wonder Jesus said to them, \"You garnish the tombs of the prophets, and you are the one that put them in there.\" After their Message is gone! A Message goes through, the people see It, they make fun of It (the world does). And then after the messenger is finished and the Message is done, then they build a denomination upon the Message. And there they die, right there, never come to Life again. [Luke 11:47]\n\nL-22 Look just a moment, to some of you people, and especially I speak to you Catholic people. Do you realize, have you ever read the actual history, the history of the Roman Catholic church? How that on your martyrology, since Saint Augustine of Hippo, how many million innocent people that the church put to death! I forget, can't call the exact number, but it's up in the millions, since Saint Hippo of... Saint Augustine of Hip-... of Hippo, Africa, made it a declaration that it was absolutely the will of God to put anybody to death that protests the Roman Catholic church. Do you realize that in that, that Saint Patrick was never recognized till after his death, as a Roman Catholic? He protested the pope and all of his doings, and the Catholic church itself killed tens of thousands of his children. Did you know that the Catholic church burnt Joan of Arc, that little sainted woman, to the stake, for be-... said she was a witch. Two hundred years later, dug up the bodies of the priests, when they found out it was wrong, and cast them into the sea, without burying them in the sacred ground, to do penance. Don't let the day pass over your head, and be foolish.\n\nL-23 How them priests would like, tonight, to come forth, that condemned Jesus. The only thing, they never seen the prediction of that hour. If they... Jesus said, \"Search the Scriptures, for in Them you think,\" or, rather, \"claim that you 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min have Eternal Life, and the Scriptures is what tell you Who I am,\" for that hour. [John 5:39]\n\nL-24 Notice, the Bible cannot fail. It's one thing It cannot do, the Word of God, fail, for It foretells Its Author's acts before He does it.\n\nL-25 Now, there's one chance out of a thousand that a man might make a prediction that something another is going to happen, and it would happen. But then if he places where it's going to happen, that cuts him down to maybe one chance out of a ten thousand. If he says the day it's going to happen, that cuts it down, one chance out of about a million. And who it's going to happen to, that brings it down to billions of chances.\n\nL-26 But this Bible tells you exactly who, when, where, and what to look for, and never has failed one time. Therefore, in a little discussion not long ago, with a priest of the Sacred Heart church up here; he said, \"Mr. Branham, you're trying to argue a Bible.\" Said, \"That's the history of the church.\" I said, \"It's not a history. It's God, Himself, in print.\" He said, \"God is in His church.\"\n\nL-27 I said, \"God is in the Word. And anything contrary to It, let it be a lie. For He said, 'Let My Word be true and every man's word a lie.'\" He said, \"We're not to argue.\" [Romans 3:4], [Isaiah 1:18]\n\nL-28 I said, \"I never asked you to argue, but the Bible does say, 'Come, let us reason together.'\"\n\nL-29 It foretells the Author's doings before He does it. Therefore, telling that, then that puts every man and woman, at the Judgment Bar, without any excuse. If you take what the Methodist say about It, what the Baptist say about It, what the Catholic says, what the Pentecostal says, or any other church, you might find some disappointments at the Judgment. But if you'll just watch what the Bible says is going to happen, and when it happens, then you'll recognize what happens.\n\nL-30 Now, it isn't right out in plain view that all people can see it, for Jesus thanked God for hiding it from the eyes of the wise and prudent, and would reveal it to babes such as would learn. Think of Almighty God sitting in His Own Word, with power to blind the rich and impudent and--and educated scholars, blind their eyes so they can't see Him, and open the eyes of the poor and illiterate. [Matthew 11:25], [Luke 10:21], [John 9:39]\n\nL-31 Notice these people from Emmaus, He said their--their understanding of Him was withheld. They talked to Him and didn't even know Who it was, all day long. God can do that, for He's God.\n\nL-32 That's exactly what He done to those priests, those scribes, because It was written that He had to do that. God blinded their eyes so we would have a chance. Notice, they couldn't see, no matter how much scholars, how much priests they was, what they had done, they still could not see It, because they were blind. Their sight might been twenty-twenty, physically. But their spiritual sight!\n\nL-33 The same thing I was trying to say this morning about the adultery of women, dressing the way they do now. They are adulterers. In God's Book they are guilty of adultery every time they put on sexy-looking clothes. Their soul, not knowing it. I believe them women, many of them, thousands of them, are innocent, and would by no means commit adultery. And the poor women, with somebody who will let them get by with it, without exposing it and tell the truth, commit adultery. Which, the Bible said, \"The whore that set upon many waters, that all the kings of the earth and the peoples of the earth, the churches and so forth, committed spiritual fornications with her. And she was THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS,\" denominations. [Revelation 17:1-2, 5]\n\nL-34 We watch the Bible, for God doesn't leave us in darkness. He sent the Bible to foretell us the events before they happened, and the very nature and time they would come.\n\nL-35 Now, it's something like looking on a calendar to see what date it is. If you think, say that this is this Saturday, Sunday, what is it? Look on the calendar. The calendar will tell you what day it is. When you see the actions of the people, maybe going to church, you see the--the... hear the bells ringing, you wonder what day it is. Look on the calendar, it'll tell you what day it is. 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min\n\nL-36 And when you see the church getting worldly, like it was in the days of Sodom, see the church world all going into the... worship \"the god of this evil age,\" and seeing that; then seeing a little minority group gathered out under the inspiration of God, producing again the Life of Jesus Christ, by the Scriptures that's supposed to happen, you know what hour you're living in.\n\nL-37 This Bible foretells, by prophecy, what day that we're living, and what time we're living, and what kind of a events ought to be taking place. It foretells it exactly to the letter, and has never missed one age, all the time. Not one time had It ever missed, and It won't, for who are predestinated to see it will see it. Jesus said, \"No man can come to Me, except My Father draws him, and all that the Father has given Me will come.\" It's the Word joining with the Word. It can't do nothing else. We know it, the day we're living in. [John 6:37, 44]\n\nL-38 But as it has been in every age, people let man put their own interpretation to this Word, and causes them to be blinded to the event that's happened. Same thing it done with the Pharisees and Sadducees. Even when Paul stood there and tried to quote the Scripture, and one man smote him in the face because he called the high priest a whited wall. And then they missed seeing God confirm His prophesied Word. [Acts 23:2-3]\n\nL-39 See, the Bible doesn't contradict Itself; the Bible is God. There's no contradiction in God; He's perfect.\n\nL-40 But the people, with their own interpretation! Now notice, let me show you, friends. The churches cannot agree themself on the 'terpretation of It. The Methodist can't agree with the Baptist, the Baptist the Presbyterian, the Presbyterian the Pentecostals. And with about forty different organizations of Pentecost, they can't agree with one another. So you see, that would be Babylon again, confusing.\n\nL-41 But God does His Own interpreting of His Word. He promised this thing, and then does it Himself. He gives, Himself, the interpretation of it, because He makes Hisself known in that hour. How far the--the Body of Christ is advanced, from the feet to the head!\n\nL-42 Notice, then that's the reason that these people fail to get it, because they listen to what somebody else says about It, instead of reading the Word like Jesus told them to do, \"And They are They that testify of Me. Search the Scriptures, in Them you think you have Eternal Life, and They are They that testify of Me.\" In other words, listen, \"What? Read the Scriptures and see what the Messiah was supposed to do. See what time the Messiah was supposed to come. Look who was going to forerun the Messiah. Look at the hour. There's to be a voice of one crying in the wilderness, John. And you done to him exactly what you listed. Look what I was supposed to do when I come. And now what have you done? Have I failed to meet This?\" See, Jesus speaking, \"Have I failed to meet This?\" [John 5:39], [John 1:23]\n\nL-43 Notice, as we come on down through the Scriptures this afternoon, how that everything that was prophesied of Him happened just exactly the way it was supposed to. They should have knowed this event. \"This fanatic, young fellow raised up, about thirty-three years old and... or thirty years old, and went down there and claimed all kinds of Lights, and Doves ascending. And, why, it was just a--a disgrace.\" They said, \"He was born with illegitimate parents, claimed He was born of a virgin birth.\"\n\nL-44 Ought they not to knowed that Isaiah said, in Isaiah 9:6, \"Unto us a child is born\"? Ought not they to know also that the prophet Isaiah said, \"A virgin shall conceive\"? They ought to have knowed these things. But, you see, the thing of it was, they were applying it somewhere way ahead. And this Man, to them, didn't meet the specification. But He asked them, \"Search the Scriptures, for you think in Them that you have Eternal Life, and They are the very thing that's testifying to My Message.\" Not what some theologian said; but what God, His Own Word, said would take place! Amen! [Isaiah 9:6], [Isaiah 7:14], [John 5:39]\n\nL-45 So is it now! Search the Scriptures, for They are the One that tells us the hour we're living in, tells us exactly what will take place in this day. They are the Ones that you should rely upon, for They are the One that testifies of the Person of Jesus Christ. For the Bible said, that, \"He's the same yesterday, today, and forever,\" 'cause He's the revelation of the Word in the age. Can't be no different. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-46 Therefore by listening to man's interpretation, they see the confirmation of God's Word fulfilled, they fail to see It. Because, it's going on all the time, but because they listen... And Jesus said, \"They're blind leaders.\" And if the blind 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min leads the blind, what happens to them? Now remember, the Bible predicted that this ecclesiastical age of this Laodicean Age was blind. They had Him outside the church. There is not another age, another church age, that Jesus was on the outside. But the Laodicea church age, He was on the outside, trying to get back in, \"I stand at the door and knock.\" He's supposed to be inside. But He said, \"Because you say, 'I'm rich, increased in goods, have need of nothing,' and don't know, don't know that you are blind, leading the blind, poor in spirit, wretched, miserable, naked, and don't know it.\" What a con-... If a man was naked on the street, miserable, blind, and knew he had sense enough that you could tell him he was naked, he'd try to do something about it. But when he shakes his head, say, \"I won't have It. Who are you to tell me what to do? I know where I'm standing.\" Now, if that ain't a pitiful shape, I don't know. And that's exactly what the God of this Bible said that the church would be in, in this evil age right now, in the last church age where we're living. [Matthew 15:14], [Revelation 3:17-20]\n\nL-47 Notice, but to the peoples, \"As many as I love, I rebuke.\" Now, if you're rebuked of the Lord, of what you're doing, come out of it then! Get away from it. \"As many as I love, I rebuke.\"\n\nL-48 Now, seeing God, now, what if those Pharisees would said, \"Wait a minute. That Man has give us quite a challenge, He said, 'Search the Scriptures, for in Them you think you have Eternal Life; They testify of Me.' It's better that I look back in the Scriptures and find out what He's supposed to do, Who He is, what's supposed to take place. I should look back and find out\"? Instead of that, they went to the priests and asked them, \"What about It?\" See the difference? They should have been reading the Word. [John 5:39]\n\nL-49 In Hebrews 1:1, the Bible said, \"God, in sundry times,\" that's, \"old times and in divers manners wrote the Bible by the prophets.\" Now notice, He wrote the Bible by His Own chosen way. See? Now, He didn't have to write It that way, neither did He have to save man by Blood. He didn't have to preach the Gospel by man; He could let the sun or the moon or the stars preach the Gospel, He could let the winds hum the Gospel. But He chose man! And He chose the way His Word came, and that was by His prophets which were predestinated and foreordained, being a part of God's Word, declaring the revelation of His Word to that age and that time. \"For the Word of God came to the prophets only.\" Never does It come to a theologian. Show me the Scripture. It comes only to prophets. God cannot lie. So God wrote the Bible by His chosen method, and His Own chosen prophets; not the prophets man had chose, but the prophets God had chose. [Hebrews 1:1-2]\n\nL-50 Then Its believers watch for the fulfillment of what their prophet said, and that's identification that they are God's prophets. Because, first, they're inspired. Next, they stay exactly with the Word of the hour. Then that's his credentials. See, we went through that last Sunday. Many false prophets will rise. And we give the illustrations of how that Balaam and Moses, both of them anointed with the same Spirit, one of them said, \"We're all one. Let's come join, put our girls and all together. We got pretty girls over here, and you boys come over here and take you a nice wife. That's all right, we're all one people, anyhow, the same race.\" God never did forgive them for it. They listened to that.\n\nL-51 See, the world and the--the people are watching for some little outlet, some little bypass, some little shortcut, but there is no shortcuts in the Word of God. There's one Pattern. You must cut yourself and fit that Pattern, not try to cut the Pattern to fit you. Everybody must do that. That's the only way God has of doing it.\n\nL-52 Notice now, the believers wait for that Word to be confirmed. See, It was not wrote by man, but by the Lord God, therefore It's not a book of man.\n\nL-53 Somebody said, \"It's just some old Hebrew writings.\" Would the Hebrews write a letter that condemned themselves? Would that fine nation of Jews, self-styled and polished, would they write their own iniquities, condemning them ownselves? Certainly not. Tell of his own sins, how they went into idolatry, how they committed fornications against God's Word? No, no. They'd never tell that, that proud nation.\n\nL-54 It's not a book of man. It's a Book of God. And the man who sees the visions or hears the Voice of God, never understood it (many times) themselves, in many cases. See? Man didn't write the Bible. God wrote the Bible. It is not... It's not a man's book. It's God's Book. It is God's thoughts expressed through human lips. That's what makes It the Bible. A thought expressed is a word. And in the beginning was God's Thinking, He expressed It through the lips of 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min His prophets and confirmed It by His servants. See? Notice.\n\nL-55 God does His Own choosing, by predestination, chose the prophets for every age. Notice it. He fixes the nature of that prophet to fit that age. See, He fits his style, whatever he does. He fits him whether he's educated or not educated. He fits the gifts, the manner that he'll preach in, the gifts he'll have. And the Message for that certain age, God's predestinated that certain thing to happen and there's not another thing can take its place. Care what it is, how many man-made achievements, nothing can take its place. He predestinated the man, maybe a ignorant man. He might have predestinated him another kind of a man. Whatever he is, He gives him his class, his--his gift, give him his nature, his style, and whatever it is, how he expresses himself, and whatever he does. He makes the man of the hour to catch the people of the hour. Right. He does it. [Romans 8:28-31]\n\nL-56 At the end of each age, when the church has turned to the world and sin, and leaning upon man's interpretation of the Word. As ever, they always, at the end of the age, have got in such a mess by their theologians and priests until it's always a mess-up. Always their interpretation is wrong, not one time has it ever failed to be wrong. And not one time has God's Word ever failed to be right. That's the difference.\n\nL-57 Now you see, God wrote the Bible, Himself. Now, God can speak. Moses said He spoke to him. Jeremiah said, \"He put Words in my mouth.\"And God can write. He wrote the ten commandments with His Own finger. He wrote on the walls of Babylon. And, remember, of the Old Testament alone, two thousand times the prophets said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD!\" God can speak, God can write. Certainly. Almost ninety percent of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, is the very Words of God Himself, Jesus Christ speaking. So, if God can write, if God can read, if God can talk, can't He cause others to do the same? Did not He say to Moses, \"Who makes man dumb or who gives him speech?\" God wrote the Bible by the prophets, His way of doing it. [Jeremiah 1:9], [Exodus 4:11]\n\nL-58 Now every time that the church gets mixed up (and God foreknew they would, for He foreknew all things), therefore He has His certain prophet ready for that age, to call His electing by His vindicated Word of signs and wonders, and confirmation of His Word, \"confirming the Word with signs following,\" as He promised. He gives the true interpretation after the prophet himself has been vindicated.\n\nL-59 All but those, the elected to whom he is sent, hate him. Now, examine every instant and see if that's right or not. Only the ones that He is sent to! \"He came to His Own, and His Own received Him not. But as many as did receive Him, to them gave He the power to become sons of God.\" Notice, no... every examination of the Word, in every instance, and at the end of every age or climax or junction, as I preached on it many times. [John 1:11-12]\n\nL-60 Look at the age of Noah, at the climax before judgment. What happened? Noah, it was only his own family that believed the man. The rest of them criticized him. And destroyed the whole world.\n\nL-61 In the days of Abraham, only Abraham's group that believed. When the angels went and preached to Sodom, only Lot and his wife and two daughters come out, and she turned back to a pillar of salt. [Genesis 19:26]\n\nL-62 In the days of Moses, only the elected of Israel come out. And Pharaoh hated him.\n\nL-63 In the days of Elijah, everything (almost) but seven thousand man, every one of them hated him, the whole nation.\n\nL-64 In the days of Jeremiah, why, they throwed unripe fruit at him, and called him a fanatic, because he laid on his side for so many days, and the other side, and--and taken things and made symbols. They hated him.\n\nL-65 Isaiah the prophet, he condemned that race so much till they sawed him in two with a saw. Right.\n\nL-66 John the Baptist. \"He was a wild man down there, some screaming maniac.\" All but--but those disciples that he presented to Jesus Christ as a church! There it is. John made ready a people. How many did he have? You could count them on both fingers... both hands, your fingers, how many that John presented to Jesus when He come. Now, what about His second Coming? Think of it.\n\nL-67 But when the true Bible believers see the Word so openly vindicated for the age, they believe. There's no way to keep them from It, believe It. They even seal their testimony with their blood. They believe It. It's then it's to them, the predestinated, that for that certain age that sees and believes. 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min\n\nL-68 Others just can't see It; they're blinded. Now, you say, \"They can't see It.\" Now, like Balaam, why couldn't Balaam see That? He was a prophet, anointed. Why couldn't Pharaoh see It? When he seen the hand of God come down and perform miracles in there, it only hardened his heart. Is that right? Why couldn't Dathan see It, a Jew himself? Right out there, had come through the Dead Sea, and eat the manna every night, that fell fresh, and still couldn't see It. Why didn't Korah see It? Why didn't Caiaphas see It? He was the head religious man of the world at that time. Why didn't he see that was the Messiah? Why didn't Judas see It? Judas was right with them, walking with them, performing miracles with them. But the Word had to be fulfilled. The Bible says they was raised up to take that place. They was raised for that purpose. That's true. Romans 8 says that. [Numbers 22:1-20], [Romans 8:28-31]\n\nL-69 Now the believers can see the Word is made flesh in their generation, God speaking. Now, them real true believers, them seven thousand (or was it seven hundred?) in the days of Elijah. Seven thousand is right. In the days of Elijah, there was seven thousand man out of about two or three million, that saw that That was right. Not even a hundredth of the people, hardly. But they saw It was right. They saw God manifested. That old widow that Elisha was sent to, she went to get those sticks, to make a cake, and just enough to make a cake for her and her son, and then die. But watch Elijah, he said, \"Make me one, first. For, THUS SAITH THE LORD, the barrel will not fail and neither will the cruse run dry until the day the Lord God sends rain upon the earth.\" No question, she took right off to make the cake and give it to him. Said, \"Make mine first, and then go make one for you and your son.\" For, she heard that man, and looked at him; she was a predestinated seed. [I Kings 17:13]\n\nL-70 Many of them say, \"There is that old crank again. God has cursed us because of him,\" remember, Elijah. Said, \"You're the one that's troubling Israel.\" [I Kings 18:18]\n\nL-71 He said, \"You're the one that's troubled Israel.\" See who God... Who's Word He was vindicating? His Own Word. [I Kings 18:17-18]\n\nL-72 Now the Bible says they was raised up for this purpose, but when... the--the unbeliever. But now when the true believer can see the Word of that age made flesh, God speaking through human lips and then doing exactly what He said He would do, that settles it!\n\nL-73 Now watch the rest of it. Don't watch signs. If you watch signs, you'll be fooled as sure as the world. False prophets will rise and show signs and wonders that'll deceive the elected if it was possible. Watch the Word. Look at these priests, these prophets, Hebrew prophet standing there. Zedekiah with two great big horns, and saying, \"I am a ordained-of-God prophet.\" It's true. \"I have three hundred and ninety-nine right here with me, and the Holy Spirit upon us, confirming and saying that land belongs to us. Let's go up and take it. And by these horns, Ahab, you'll push the enemy off of our ground, for God gave us the ground.\" [I Kings 22:11-12]\n\nL-74 Watch that religious man, good man, Jehoshaphat, said, \"Haven't you got one more?\"\n\nL-75 \"One more? There's four hundred in agreement!\" He said, \"Yes, there is one more around here, but I hate him.\" Said, \"He's always bawling all of us out and telling us what great sinners we are, and everything.\" Say, \"I hate him! He, he is Micaiah, the son of Imlah.\"\n\nL-76 He said, \"Oh, don't let the king say so. Go get him and let's hear what he said.\" So they brought him down there. He said, \"Give me tonight and I'll see what the Lord says about it.\" Ahab said, \"I adjure you, don't you tell me nothing but the truth.\" And the man come, said, \"Now, if you want to get back in good fellowship, say just like the rest of them.\" Micaiah said, \"I'll say just what God says.\" See? [I Kings 22:2-10]\n\nL-77 The next morning, they come out. The kings put their robes on, set in the gate, all of the celebrity. The prophet standing there. Said, \"Now, fanatic, what you say about it?\" Said, \"Go on up.\" Said, \"But I seen Israel scattered like sheep having no shepherd.\" [I Kings 22:15-18]\n\nL-78 He sma-... took his hand and smacked him in the mouth. The prophet smacked the prophet in the mouth. Now, both those anointed prophets standing there, prophesied, four hundred against one, that looked pretty strong. Now, in the multitude of counsel it's not always safety. Depends on where they're... what they're counseling about, what their 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min counsel is. There wasn't safety there for the king, and he took that multitude for their counseling to be right. But if he had just stopped and turned back the scroll and look what Elijah had just said. [I Kings 22:24], [I Kings 22:17]\n\nL-79 Then, Micaiah couldn't say anything, he didn't know, when maybe God forgave him for it. But first, being a prophet, he went to God to find out what God said. And he found out what God said. He said, \"I saw God sitting upon a throne, and He said... had all of His counselors of Heaven gathered around Him, said, 'Who can We get to go down and cause Ahab to come out here, so We can otherwise fulfill the prophecy that's made about him?'\"\n\nL-80 See, prophecy, Elijah had already said, \"The dogs will lick your blood.\" [I Kings 22:38]\n\nL-81 And so he said he \"seen a lying spirit go up from beneath, come up, come up before Him, said, 'I'll go down and get in his prophets, Ahab's prophets, and cause them to prophesy a lie.'\" [I Kings 22:21-22]\n\nL-82 Now, God knew that them man was so puffed up and so full of theology that they thought they had everything right. They had never noticed the Word for the hour. So God said, \"You will succeed; go on down.\" And when Micaiah said that, that made them prophesying under an evil spirit. They'd have jerked the plug out of the telephone, or turned off the radio, or done anything; they heard That coming against them, got up and walked out. But look what happened. Now, Micaiah had to check his vision with the written Word, therefore he knowed. [I Kings 22:9-28]\n\nL-83 He said, \"When I come... Put that man in prison, give him waters of sorrow and bread of sorrow. When I return, I'll deal with him.\"\n\nL-84 He said, \"If you come back at all, God never spoke to me.\" That's when he knows his vision is exactly with every Word for that hour. It was Ahab's time. [I Kings 22:28]\n\nL-85 Brother, sister, this is the hour and the time of the calling out of Babylon. The evening Lights are here. Walk in the Light while it is light. Notice, the believers saw the Word manifested and believe It. Jesus said, \"My sheep know My Voice, My Word, My signs of the age. A false one they'll not follow.\" [John 10:27]\n\nL-86 Now let's get to our text, 'cause I see I'm going to get away. I'm wanting to emphasize on that prayer line a lot. Let's get back to the text now we got under consideration, here for a minute. Well, it'll happen again like it always did, as usual.\n\nL-87 God sent His prophet, John, as His Word had said, promised in Malachi 3, \"Behold, I send My messenger before My face, to prepare the way.\" John witnessed the same thing. And we find out also, in Isaiah 40:3, that Isaiah said, \"There will be a voice of a prophet, one crying in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord.'\" See? All those prophecies! And--and look, notice quickly, the Scripture identified him. [Malachi 3:1], [Isaiah 40:3] When they said, \"Who are you? Are you the Messiah?\" He said, \"I am not.\" \"Are you Jeremiah? The prophets, or one of them? [John 1:20-23]\n\nL-88 He said, \"I am not. But I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, as saith the prophet Isaiah.\" [John 1:23]\n\nL-89 You think they would believe that? No, sir. Why? He didn't come through their church. He wasn't of their... See, he went in the wilderness at the age of nine years old, and come out at thirty. His message was too great to go through a school of theology; he was the one to introduce the--the Messiah. And everybody would be pulling him this way and that way. And God sent him in the wilderness, after the death of his father, Zechariah. And he was a priest, but he never followed the line of his father. [Matthew 3:1-3]\n\nL-90 Cause, prophets don't come out of such things as that. They come from the rugged lands, the wilderness. No man knows where they come from, or how they arise on the scene, or any of their history. They just come right out and preach the Word, and God takes them off, and away they go; condemns that generation, and moves on into His Word, waiting for the great day.\n\nL-91 The church did not believe him, because he was not known of them. They had no record of his ordination on their books, so therefore they refused him. See, they didn't believe God's vindicated Word, plainly, letter by letter. See? Malachi 3, two Scriptures to vindicate him, Malachi 3 and Isaiah 40:3. See, both those Scriptures spoke of a man 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min coming, preparing the way of the Lord. He met every specification of it. [Malachi 3:1], [Isaiah 40:3]\n\nL-92 He was to be a prophet. \"I'll send to you Elisha.\" And there he was, in every rugged way. Watch how his nature blended in with Elijah. Elijah was a man of the wilderness, so was John; the outdoors. He wasn't a smooth man, he was a rugged man.\n\nL-93 Notice again, Elijah was a woman hater, he told Jezebel about all of her paint, and where to get on and off at. So was John. Jezebel tried to kill Elijah, swore by her gods that she'd take his head off of him. So did Herodia. See? [II Kings 9:30], [Mark 6:17-20]\n\nL-94 Always watch their message, watch what they did. Now we find out that if they would a looked back and seen what the Bible said, and watched the nature of the man and how perfect he was in time with the Scriptures and everything, they ought to have knowed that was him. About a half a dozen knew it. That's right. Not over a half a dozen realized it. They went to hear him, but they didn't believe It. See? Why? They did not believe the identification of prophecy in their hour.\n\nL-95 Notice, they laughed at him, calling him some \"screaming, wild, unlearned fanatic with no schooling, 'hit, hain't, tote, carry, fetch,' so forth.\" As usual they judge him by his education. They judge him by his grammar, by the way he dressed. He had a piece of sheepskin around him, and a camel skin belt on, he was all hairy. Walking out in the waters; no church, no pew, no co-operation; they couldn't accept that; they was worshiping the god of the world. See?\n\nL-96 I don't mean to say now there's not false prophets that comes out, like Jambres and Jannes. But the way you want to do, is check the original message by the Word, then you got it; what age it's in, and what's prophesied for that age. [II Timothy 3:8]\n\nL-97 Then John's prophecy was vindicated in God's Own order. Watch how perfect. The Bible said, \"The Word of the Lord comes to the prophet.\" And Jesus was the Word. And John was prophesying of the coming of the Word for fulfillment; and Jesus, the Word, came to the prophet, in the water. Oh, how beautiful! How unfailing is the... See? The Word was a scarce thing in that day. Here come the prophet, saying, \"I am the voice of the Word.\" They said, \"What must we do?\" [Isaiah 40:3]\n\nL-98 Said, \"I'm not worthy to unloose His shoes. But there is One standing among you, somewhere, He'll be the One that'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire. His fan is in His hand, and He'll thoroughly purge His floor, and burn the chaff with unquenchable fire, take the grain to the garner.\" Oh, what a prophet! Jesus said there was never a man born of a woman as great as he, till that day. Oh, how blusterous! How he knowed where he was standing! He knowed exactly. He heard from God, and it was exactly with the Word, so he didn't care what people said. He preached It and prophesied It, anyhow. And watch, when a man stands for what is Truth, then God is obligated to vindicate that man the Truth. [Matthew 3:12]\n\nL-99 When Moses come down there in Egypt, and said, \"I was in the wilderness yonder, and I seen a tree on fire, and it didn't consume. I went up to the tree, and, when I did, there was a great Pillar of Fire hanging in there. And a Voice said, 'I AM THAT I AM.' And He told me to take this stick and come down here and perform these miracles, and God will vindicate His Word.\" Stretched out his stick, there come fleas and flies, and darkness and so forth. And then to vindicate that prophet, He brought those believers right back to the mount, and God came down in the same Pillar of Fire, right on the same mountain, and proved that that was right. [Exodus 3:14] Now look what He's done in this day. Exactly.\n\nL-100 Now, the Word come to the prophet and vindicated him to be the true person, the very person that the Scriptures said that he would be. Quickly now. But, again, Jesus came in a different form from their manmade interpretation of the prophecy. Man had interpreted what it would be. Certainly. The Presbyterians thinks that it ought to be them. Watch when God does anything, watch every other organization rise up with one. Yeah, always been that way. They got a Jambres and Jannes everywhere. Notice, they said part of the Word. But, according to the prophet's Word, every Letter! [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-101 They missed it again, as usual, called Him a fortune-teller, \"a devil; Beelzebub,\" and said He made Himself God, 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min when they ought to have knowed, by their very Bible, that He was God. Notice, He was prophesied by Isaiah, Isaiah 9:6, said, \"His Name shall be called The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father.\" There ain't going to be no more fathers after that, 'cause He was the first Father in the beginning, He's the only Father; said, \"Don't you call any man of this earth, 'Father,' either, after that.\" \"He's the--The Mighty God, and The Everlasting Father, The Counselor, The Prince of Peace.\" Certainly. [Matthew 23:9], [Isaiah 9:6]\n\nL-102 Now, they had done to Him what all the prophets listed that they would do, just as they are doing in this very Laodicean Age, put Him out of the church. \"Blind, naked, and don't know it.\" Just what the prophet said, the prophet of the Bible. Blinded by man's traditions, they put Him out, the Word out of their churches, as usual, as prophesied of them. [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-103 Notice now, quickly now. Don't miss this now. Here is the text, how Jesus made Himself known to these two disciples that He was their Messiah! Now, all eyes this way. And out in the land, don't miss this now. We've tried to tell you that the Bible is the Word of God, wrote by God Himself, through the lips and instrumentality of man. God can write, Himself. God can speak, Himself. God can do what He wants to, but He chose man to do it because the man that wrote It is part of God. So, God wrote the Bible. The men didn't even know what they were writing, in their own human thinking. They might disagree with It, but they wrote It. They couldn't. The Bible said, \"Men of old, as they was moved by the Holy Ghost!\" God moved their hands, moved their eyes in the visions. They could say nothing but what they were looking at. They could speak nothing, 'cause He had full control of tongue, finger, every organ of the body was in full sway with God. No wonder the Bible said they were gods, they were a part of God! He was the fullness of God. [II Peter 1:21]\n\nL-104 Notice how Jesus, the Word, made these two heartbroke disciples know He was their Messiah, the Messiah, the promised Word. Notice what He done, He appealed to prophecy. Notice, \"Fools, slow to believe all that the prophets wrote.\" Now, He never said, \"Well, what, what does the church say about it?\"\n\nL-105 They give Him the story. They knowed all the events that happened. They was all sad. They begin to tell Him, \"Are You just a stranger here, or You don't know what's happened in Jerusalem?\"\n\nL-106 He said, \"What things?\" like He didn't know. See, He does things some time just to see what you'll do about it. See? Said, \"What things? Who was it? What's happened?\"\n\nL-107 \"Are You just a stranger?\" And was talking right to the Man they had lived with for three and a half years, and didn't know Him. \"What things? What happened?\" [Luke 24:19]\n\nL-108 \"Well,\" they said, \"Jesus of Nazareth, which was a Prophet. There's no doubt in our mind. He was mighty in Word and deed before all the people. We seen Him do things that He was identified the Prophet of God for this age. We know that. And we believed that He would be the Redeemer, that He would redeem Israel.\" [Luke 24:19]\n\nL-109 Then He turns and said, \"You fools, slow of heart to believe that all that the prophets said about Him wouldn't come to pass?\" See? Watch Him now go back to prophecy. What a rebuke for believers, claimed they believed Him! [Luke 24:25]\n\nL-110 Notice how He approached the subject. He never come right out and said, \"I am your Messiah.\" He could have done it, for He was. But notice He identified Himself in the Word, then they would know. If He'd a said it, He could a said that and it wouldn't have been so; but when He went and begin to speak on all the prophets said about Him, and they seen it, then they could tell themselves, if they were God's children. But called their attention to what the prophets had foretold and said to look for in the time that the Messiah, His age, would be manifested. He, as John, let the Word, the Bible, identify their Message. Any true prophet would do it. Didn't come out and say, \"I am He. I'm...\" That's not a true prophet of God. See? But He said, \"Go back in the Scriptures.\" See, He never fails His way of doing it. See? [Luke 24:27] He said, \"We know Moses.\" [John 5:46], [John 9:28-29]\n\nL-111 He said, \"If you would a knowed Moses, you'd know Me.\" He said, \"Moses wrote of Me.\" Said, \"Search the 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min Scripture, in Them you think you have Eternal Life, and the Scripture is what testifies of Me. Go and look in the Scripture and see it.\"\n\nL-112 Here He never changes His way of doing it, never has changed. He never can change, because He's the unchanging God. See? Notice He went right back to these two disciples, Cleopas and his friend, on the road to Emmaus, and said, appealed to the Scriptures to them, said, \"Why are you so foolish to not to believe that every Word the prophets wrote concerning the Messiah would have to be fulfilled?\" Oh, what a day!\n\nL-113 John did the same thing. \"Search the Scriptures, look back, said there'd be 'a voice of one crying in the wilderness.' Where did I come from?\" See? That's, that should have made it plain to them. Right! [John 5:39]\n\nL-114 Should make it plain today, the thing that we see the Holy Spirit doing. He once said, \"Search the Scriptures.\" And we... He wants us to do it today.\n\nL-115 Notice, He begin with Moses' prophecy, the Bible said, \"He, beginning with Moses and all of the prophets,\" but He started with Moses. \"A Prophet,\" said Moses, \"the Lord your God shall raise up among you people, among the people. The Lord God shall raise up a Prophet.\" [Deuteronomy 18:15, 18], [Acts 3:22], [Acts 7:37]\n\nL-116 Now He might have said, \"Cleopas, and your friend here, did not Moses say that in these days the Lord God would raise up a Prophet? And this Man that they crucified, did He meet that qualification? Now, Moses prophesied this. And now you haven't had a prophet for hundreds and hundreds of years, and here this Man raised up. And what was this Man's forerunner, did you say?\" Get it? And all the prophets said about Him, for His age, He spoke to them. It sure would have been interested to listen at Him. Wouldn't you liked to heard Him? I'd like to heard Him, to hear Him, what He said that the prophets said about Himself, but He never said it was Him. He just showed them by prophecy. He just said, \"The prophet said this would happen.\" See?\n\nL-117 Let's just go back a few minutes, and now let's listen to the Words quoted from Himself. Watch here, the Word Itself quoting the Word of Himself. The Word Itself quoting the Word of Himself. Not tell them that He was that, but just let the Word speak for Itself, then they know Who He was. The letter of the Word, quoting the Word in... The Word in flesh, quoting the Word of the letter, being fully identified with Himself. Look here, now let's listen to Him quote. How... Now, we know that they were all briefed of the late happenings, that is, of the crucifixion and of the story of the resurrection, the tomb, as we just read. Now He goes straight to the Word of prophecy about Himself. Now let's just think that He said this; He said a lot more than this, but watch. [Luke 24:27], [John 1:1-4, 14]\n\nL-118 Let's say Him... hear Him say, \"Turn over to Zechariah 11:12. And wasn't the Messiah to be sold, according to the prophet, for thirty pieces of silver? You just said that this Man was sold for thirty pieces of silver. Turn over...\" You getting them Scriptures? Zechariah 11:12. And then He said, \"Did you notice what David said in the Psalms, Psalm 41:9? He was be betrayed by His friends. And then again, in Zechariah 13:7, He was forsaken by His disciples. And in Psalms 35:11, accused by false witnesses. You just said He was. Isaiah 53:7, He was dumb before His accusers. Isaiah 50:6, they scourged Him, the prophet said. Psalms 22, He was to cry on the cross, 'My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?' Did He do that, day before yesterday afternoon? Psalms 22 again, 18, His garments was parted among them. Did they do that? And Psalms 22:7 to 8, mocked by His enemies, the church. Psalms 22 again, there was not a bone in His body to be broke, but 'they pierced My hands and My feet,'\" He said. Holding His hands behind Him, no doubt, at the time. \"Isaiah 53:12 said He would die between malefactors. Isaiah 53:9 said He was buried with the rich. Psalms 16:10 said, 'I will not leave His soul in hell, neither will I suffer My Holy One to see corruption.' And was not Malachi 3 the forerunner of this Man?\" Oh, I'd like to have heard Him quote that. Look at the prophecies! Notice, then all the types He might have went through, about Isaac, in Genesis 22, how God foreshadowed Isaac, how father Abraham took his own son, packing the wood up the hill, and offered up his own son. [Zechariah 11:12], [Psalms 41:9], [Psalms 22:1], [Genesis 22:2], [Zechariah 13:7], [Psalms 35:11], [Isaiah 53:7, 9, 12], [Isaiah 50:6], [Psalms 22:1, 13, 15, 17-18], [Psalms 16:10], [Genesis 22:2-3, 6-14]\n\nL-119 It was now beginning to soak into them. He had done told them they were fools for not looking at the prophecy for that day. And now it begin to soak in, begin to see the fulfilling of all this that had taken place in the last few days, 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min in the last two or three years, the vindicated prophecy of the age. It was then that they knew that their crucified friend, Jesus, had fulfilled every Word of this. Oh, it was then that they knowed that that Man truly was that Messiah, that--that He should raise from the dead. \"The grave couldn't hold Him. 'I will not suffer My Holy One to see corruption.' There's not one Word of prophecy can ever fail. And He did raise.\" [Luke 24:25], [Psalms 16:10]\n\nL-120 \"Then that messengers down at the tomb this morning was right. He is risen from the dead. He is alive. He is that Messiah.\" Why? Don't fail it. \"His action, His ministry and everything He's done has been vindicated exactly the Words that the prophet said would take place for this day. That's done it.\" Then they knowed that it was Him, their crucified friend, Jesus, that had done it. No wonder their hearts burned within them as He talked to them. Now they had walked six miles, and it seemed like a short time. [Luke 24:32]\n\nL-121 And here's another thing they had done, you know, they had heard a six-hour sermon on prophecy being vindicated. That's what He talked to them along the road. Just as soon as they started down the road, He stepped out, for He was right there at Jerusalem. Six hours late-e... later, sixty furlongs, they was right down the road six miles to Emmaus. That's what it is. And He had preached, confirmed prophecy for six hours. Don't condemn me on my three, then, see. See? But notice, they had preached... He... They had heard a six-hour sermon on prophecy being confirmed, vindicated.\n\nL-122 Now it was getting along towards evening time. You know, He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. It was then that He opened their eyes to know that Hebrews 13:8, He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. At the evening time, events are made clear by the prophecy. What's taking place in the modern hour can be easily identified if you'll just believe the prophecy of the hour. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-123 \"Yes, fools, slow of understanding, slow to believe (you keep pondering over it), to believe that all the prophets said about the Messiah, wouldn't it have to happen?\" Now He checked these points all back and showed what the prophet said that would happen. Then they begin to understand. So He said... act like He was going to go on by. They liked this Man. They said, \"You, You've give us something. We never thought that. He is alive somewhere.\" They was talking to Him, didn't know it. So He... and no doubt He looked at them sadly, and He started to walk on by, but He--He was waiting for them to invite Him. That's what He's waiting tonight, for you to invite Him. [Luke 24:25]\n\nL-124 Notice, when those disciples invited Him in to their fellowship around the table, it was then that He done something just like He did before His crucifixion, and their eyes come open. They knowed His manner, His style. They knowed what He done, and He did it then just like He did before. And they said, \"That's Him!\" And quickly they raised up to scream it out, and He vanished. And where they took six hours to listen to this sermon, maybe twenty minutes they were light-footed back to tell the rest of them, \"He is risen indeed. He is really alive.\" [Luke 24:41-42, 45, 52-53]\n\nL-125 Friends, this is the fulfillment of Malachi 4, Saint Luke 17, Saint John 15, oh, so many, Revelations 10, so many prophecies that can be pinned exactly to this day. And also in the Book of Mark and in Matthew, where He said these great signs and wonders would appear in the sky, and people call them saucers, flying saucers, can--can vanish with the power and quickness of a thought, intelligence that can move in. He can write, He can speak, He can do whatever He wants to. The great Pillar of Fire, \"the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" And sights coming upon the earth, pyramids of smoke rising into the air, way above where there cannot be no humidity nor nothing, thirty miles high. Predicted a year and a half before it happened, that it would be that way. Then turn the picture and see Who it is looking down. Not one Word has ever failed that's been told, and here is God's written Word, confirming it's the Truth. And it's evening time again. I wonder if He would return, by grace, tonight and do something now like He done back there. Let's pray and ask Him. Events made clear by vindicated prophecy. [Hebrews 13:18], [Malachi 4:5-6], [Luke 17:30], [John 15:26], [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-126 God Almighty, help us. Help us, dear God, to understand, to understand the things that we should know, understand Thy Word. And now, Lord, we have heard sermons now for nearly two thousand years, writings of books. And in this last days here it's slipped right back again, and now it's towards evening time. The Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, and many of them down through the age has talked with You, and maybe just along the way of this great day that hasn't been either night or day, as the prophet said, but in the evening time it'll be Light. Jesus rose from the 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min tomb and appeared to Simon and to the women, and showed them that He was alive. That was the morning. And then in evening He come back again. But He did walk to them through the day, rebuking them for their blindness, but then He made Hisself known to them in the evening time. [Luke 24:22-23], [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-127 God, come into our fellowship tonight that we have around the Word. God, it's so scarcely believed today amongst the peoples, but I'm thankful that there is some that You have called and ordained them to Eternal Life, and You said, \"All that the Father has given Me will come.\" And now while the evening Lights are shining, while You have permitted, Lord, that not one prophecy (out of the hundreds that's went forth) has ever failed one time. Then truly if that identifies, it has to be You, 'cause no person could be that accurate. Just like the Bible, no man could write, no one in the space of sixteen hundred years, by forty different writers, could write, and not one error be in It. [John 6:37] Dear God, I pray that You will manifest Yourself tonight, of Hebrews 13:8, that You're the same yesterday, today, and forever. And the works that You did then, You do today. And You promised it, You said, \"In this last days, when the world is sitting like Sodom and Gomorrah, perversion.\" We look at these boys just so much like girls, wearing clothes like them, and--and see the girls trying to act like boys, and see the women and man in this perverted age, see sex appeal has become a--a idol of worship. The Gospel has been pushed out to one side, and nakedness in the Laodicea church. O God, what a hour! Come, Lord Jesus, make Yourself known to us. For we ask it in Jesus' Name. [Hebrews 13:8], [Luke 17:28-30], [Revelation 3:14, 17-18]\n\nL-128 Now while you have your heads bowed, your eyes closed, I'm going to ask you something. You believe that God is here? Do you believe that the things It's doing today is prophecy fulfilled? Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever? Do you believe when He was here and manifested in the flesh for that day, and the works that He done there, was to be repeated again in this day? The prophet said so. The Bible said so. All Scripture must be fulfilled, it cannot fail. How did He identify Himself? By being that Prophet that Moses spoke of. Knowed the secrets of the hearts of the people. The woman touched His garment, He turned and said, \"Thy faith has saved Thee.\" When Simon Peter come up to Him, He knowed his name, told him who he was, who his father was. And that same lovely Jesus is not dead, He's alive forevermore. Praise be to God! And I believe, in this evening time now, He's called us together again. [Matthew 9:20], [Luke 8:44]\n\nL-129 O Lord Jesus, come among us. Don't pass us by. Come, stay all night with us till this night is over, then let us go with You tomorrow; we might know You in the power of Your resurrection, that Your love and grace and mercy might be with us. O Eternal God, grant these things. We know that only God alone can grant them.\n\nL-130 In the solemnness of this hour, let us say this. God, our Father, our flesh is a poor tabernacle for You. But, Lord, let Your sanctifying grace, Your Holy Spirit, come now. Cleanse us from every doubt and every flusteration, every suspicion and every line of skepticism that would be in us, that we might be free without one doubt; come out, confess boldly like Peter, \"Thou art the Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-131 We believe that Thy Word is Truth, Lord. Let us just see, before we start this prayer line, Lord, make Yourself known to us. As You said, \"As it was in the days of Lot,\" when Abraham, that called-out group waiting for a promised son, Lot was down there hearing a modern Billy Graham and an Oral Roberts to that denominational setup down there, as a nation. But Abraham was a sojourner without any organization, just this little group wandering about through the land that he was to heir. \"And the meek shall inherit the earth.\" One day, under the shade tree, while they were sitting, resting, God came down in the form of a Man. Two angels went down into Sodom. And God, in human flesh, proved that He was, He said, \"Abraham, where is thy wife, Sarah?\" A few days before that, he was Abram; and S-a-r-r-a, Sarra; not Sarah, \"princess.\" And You called her by her princess name, the daughter of a king. You called Abraham by his name, Abraham, a father of nations. And You said, \"I am going to visit you.\" [Matthew 5:5], [Genesis 17:15]\n\nL-132 God, how that prophet's heart must have jumped! He knowed Who You was right then. No wonder he washed Your feet, brought out all the food that he had, and the very best, laid it before You. He knew that was God there. Then He said, \"Where is Sarah?\" as if He didn't know. And You...\n\nL-133 Abraham said to Him, \"He's in the tent... she's in the tent, behind You.\" 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min\n\nL-134 And You said what was going to happen. And she, in her heart, doubted It. And then You--You said to Abraham, \"Why did Sarah doubt that, saying in her heart, 'These things can't be'? Is anything too hard for God?\"\n\nL-135 O God! Jesus, manifested God of the Word, You said, \"As it was in the days of Sodom,\" the world would be in that condition just before the destruction of the Gentile world, the Gentile dispensation. Here we are, Sodomites to the core! And then You said that the Son of man, which is always referred to as a \"prophet,\" would be revealed in that hour. Fulfill Thy Words, O God. We, Your believing children, wait with sincere hearts, to give us faith, Lord, that, when we have the prayer line, the people will believe. It's evening time, Father. Let the evening Lights of the Son of God (He that Was, and Which Is, and Shall Come) manifest Hisself by the prophecy that He's made. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-136 I am now ready to--to pray for the sick. But it's a strange thing, how that when we stand here. Here I stand here now making a challenge to the public, and hooked up across the nation, that God still is God. He cannot fail. And what He promises, that He'll do. He'll never fail to do it, for He promised to do it. Therefore I can place solemn confidence in what He said. Therefore I look for His Coming, I look for Him to appear at any time, because He said, \"In an hour that you think not,\" the world thinks not, \"then He'll appear.\"\n\nL-137 Now, so far as I know... I'm in my tabernacle here, and there's a few people sitting here that I--I do know. Brother Wright, a few of these sitting here, that right along here, I do know. But there is many of you I do not know. And I have no way of saying that God will do this tonight. We have seen Him do it for the past years and years, but He might not do it tonight. I don't know. That's up to Him. He is sovereign. He does what He wishes to. No one can tell Him what to do. He abides alone, in His will and His ways. But because that He promised it, I'm asking Him to do it. Not for our sake, that we need it, but maybe for some strangers' sake, that the Holy Spirit might be anointed... now anointing upon us. Now, no matter how much He anoints me, He's got to anoint you, too, certainly, to believe.\n\nL-138 Now I want to have a prayer line, and I want to pray for the sick as much as I can. Now, we can either have a line, to call the people and bring them up here, a prayer line and pray for everybody here that's sick, I suppose, have my minister brothers to come here with us, and lay hands upon you. We can sure do that. Or either we can ask our Father, Who is the only One that could do anything for you, 'cause my hands is just a man like you man. But the thing of it is, it isn't the human hand that does it; it's the Word of God. Faith in that Word is what does it. No scientific thing about it, it's altogether unscientific.\n\nL-139 There's not one thing the Christian has in his armor that's scientific. Did you know that? Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, meekness, gentleness, patience, faith, Holy Ghost, everything is unseen by science. And that's the only thing that's real and lasting. Everything you look at come from the earth and goes back to the earth. But the things that you can't see with your eye, but see It declare Itself, that's the world of Eternal. [Galatians 5:22], [II Corinthians 4:18]\n\nL-140 Would you believe, if God would manifest Himself and show that He is here alive, doing the same things that He did at the beginning, after this Message, would you accept it as your healing? May God grant it. Now I'm asking anybody in the house, no matter who you are or where you're from, I'm asking you just to solemnly believe this Message to be the Truth. That is the Message that God has in His Bible for this hour, that Jesus Christ is here tonight and is alive. Now nearly...\n\nL-141 All you people know of me, I'm right here in town where I was raised up. I don't even have a grammar school education. That's exactly true. And you've knowed me long enough, I hope I've lived before you to show you that I'm honest and sincere. I'm not a hypocrite. Even my critics don't say that. They, they just say, \"You're--you're not a hypocrite, but you're just simply wrong. You're just ignorantly wrong, not willfully.\" I don't think that I'm ignorantly wrong, because the Word of God testifies of my Message, and It should tell you Who It is. And you clearly hear me say It isn't me, so then It has to be Him. Is that right? Have faith in God then. Look this a way, and you believe God. If you can believe God, God will grant to you. If He can do that like He did before, then He's still God. You believe that?\n\nL-142 You believe it? A lady sitting here before me, looking at me, tears in her eyes, sincerely. I don't know who she is, 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min never seen her. I'm a stranger to you. Do you think God knows the secret of your heart, your desires, or your sin, or whatever it is? You think He knows? You think He could reveal to me what your sin is, what you've done, what you ought not have done, or your desire, whatever it is? If He would do it, would it make you believe Him, know that it has to be Him? Would you accept it as Him? It's not your sin that's bothering you; you've confessed that. But you're wanting the baptism of His Holy Spirit. You shall receive It. I seen It move down across her.\n\nL-143 That you might know that I was looking at the woman, she was looking at me, I want to show you the Holy Spirit. Look here, right over this little woman sitting here, down beneath my feet here. When I said that, that's the same thing she wants, is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You believe that you will receive It, sister? Raise up your hand, then. I have never seen the woman in my life, knowingly.\n\nL-144 See this man sitting here with his head down, sitting right there, with his collar misfitting him, and so forth. You suffer with a bladder trouble. You believe that God will make you well? Raise up your hand if you'll accept It. All right, God grant you your request.\n\nL-145 This young man sitting right here, wanting the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You believe God will give It to you; sir, with your white string tie hanging back? God will grant it.\n\nL-146 This man here is praying for his wife. She is in an institution. You believe that God will heal her, make her well? You believe it? You can have it.\n\nL-147 With your hand up to your throat, you believe that God can heal that heart condition that's bothering you, that stomach trouble that you have? You're sitting there, suffering right now. Is that right? You believe He heals you? Then you can have it. Amen.\n\nL-148 You see He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Ask those people, see if I know them. I don't, but He does. Amen. See that Light on the side of the wall yonder, hanging right down over a man sitting there. He is suffering with a spinal condition in his back. He's not from here, he's from Georgia. Mr. Duncan, believe with all your heart, God will heal that back trouble. You believe with all your heart? God bless you. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-149 Here's a man sitting way back here, with back trouble, looking at me. I don't know him, but it's Mr. Thompson. You believe? Raise up, sir, back there, so that... I'm a stranger to you. That's right. But you're sitting there, praying. Your back trouble is healed now. Jesus Christ makes you well.\n\nL-150 \"It shall be Light just about the evening time.\" Don't you see, He's here tonight! He's the great I AM. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do you believe it? Are you satisfied and convinced that this is Jesus Christ making Hisself known, identifying Himself in prophecy? [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-151 Don't worry about the eye. God heals the sick and the afflicted.\n\nL-152 How many people that... How many is in here, sick? Let's see your hands. Just seems like it's such a pull and a strain. Have any of you people got prayer cards? I don't know how I'd get you through here. I want to pray for you, and I don't know how to do it. You see what, look at the wall, how I'm going to get them in there? What if you get one aisle jammed? You got the other one blocked right there, everybody stopped still.\n\nL-153 Listen, hear me. Have I ever told you anything in the Name of the Lord but what come to pass? Is that right? Everything has always been right. I've never asked you for one penny of money in my life, have I? Not one time. Never took a offering in my life. I'm not here for money. I'm not here to deceive you. I'm here to manifest God's Word of the hour. I've told you the Truth, and God has testified that it is the Truth. Now I tell you, THUS SAITH THE SCRIPTURES, that if the believer lays his hands upon the sick, Jesus said, \"They shall recover!\" Do you believe that? Then, in the Presence of God, don't you believe He'll do it right now? [Mark 16:18], [I Samuel 3:19]\n\nL-154 Now put your hands on one another, and just hold it there for a minute. Now, don't--don't pray, just put your hands on one another; out there in the land. And me, myself, I'm laying myself over these handkerchiefs. Now I want you to look at me just a minute. What has God left undone? Look how He's, what the Word that we have read, the prophecies that we have told, that Jesus identified Himself by the prophecies. Now look at the hour, and these last three 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min weeks where we have placed the hour that we're living. Look at what we have read, how about the false prophets and almost signs that would deceive the elected. How the Word has been manifested, how the god of this age has blinded the lie, hearts of the people. And how that God Himself has said through His prophecies that these things would take place in this Laodicea Age. There is nothing left undone. God is here just the same God that talked to those people on Emmaus, that identified Himself by the prophecies that was foretold of Him, He is here tonight identifying His Presence by the prophecies foretold for this age. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Can you believe it? Then lay your hands upon one another. Don't pray for yourself, but in your own way pray for that person that you got your hands on, because they are praying for you. Now look, don't doubt. [Mark 16:18], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-155 And now if you could see what I'm looking at! And you know I wouldn't lie to you, standing here. If you could see, and your faith could draw that great Holy Spirit that sailed yonder in the air--air, that science has took pictures of, and see It moving through this building just trying to find a place to--to land, trying to find a anchor place. Only believe It, my brother. He's identified it by Scripture and so forth, that it's right. Now pray with sincerity for that person you got your hands on; they are praying for you.\n\nL-156 Dear Jesus of Nazareth, for, we are conscious, Lord, by the Word, that You're here, by the promise that You are here, \"Wherever two or three are gathered in My Name, there I am in the midst of them. And these signs will follow them that believe; if they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" Out over the waves of this telephone, may the great Holy Spirit go into every congregation. May the same Holy Light that we look at right here in the church, may It fall upon each and every one, and may they be healed at this time. We rebuke the enemy, the Devil, in the Presence of Christ; we say to the enemy, that he is defeated by the--the vicarious suffering, the death of the Lord Jesus and the triumph resurrection on the third day; and His proven evidence that He is here among us tonight, alive, after nineteen hundred years. Let the Spirit of the living God fill every heart with faith and power, and healing virtue from the resurrection of Jesus Christ, Who is identified now by this great Light circling the church, in His Presence. In the Name of Jesus Christ, grant it for the glory of God. [Matthew 18:20], [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-157 May these handkerchiefs that we pray over, may they go to the sick and the afflicted that they're intended to. May the same Holy Spirit that's here now identifying Himself, identify Himself on every patient that these is laid upon. May the Presence of God so fill their heart with faith until the sickness of their body will be healed. This we ask, for the glory of God, in the Presence of Jesus Christ and in the Name of Jesus Christ, as we the servants of Jesus Christ ask it. Amen.\n\nL-158 Now from your hearts, I don't care what was wrong with you, can you, from your heart, believe with all your heart that the Word of God has granted you your request? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] I believe that every hand, as I could see, went up. If you believe it, now remember, it is finished.\n\nL-159 You out there on the telephone wires, if you have believed with all your heart, as the ministers are laying hands upon you, and your loved ones laying hands upon you, if you believe with all your heart that it's finished, it's finished. The great Holy Spirit, He's here in the tabernacle tonight. I seen Him move over the people, showed Hisself over here on the side of a wall, and went down upon a man, come down here and up through the building, making known the secrets of the hearts, the identification of His Presence, to show that He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He is in our midst! He's God, the never-failing God. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-160 And did not our hearts burn within us, and does not it burn now, to know that we are now in the Presence of the resurrected Jesus Christ, to Whom be glory and praise forevermore; Who is in the express image of the Almighty Jehovah; Who sailed down in a form of a Pillar of Fire in a burning bush, to attract the attention of a prophet; Who had descended upon the mountain, and anyone that even touched it was to be killed, besides Moses and Joshua. How it was that He led the children of Israel through the wilderness, in their journey, as a type of the called-out people today. Here He is, by scientific research, even identified Himself before science. And by His very actions and by His very prophecy, the things that's prophesied of Him to do in this day, to make Him the same yesterday, today, and forever, has been perfectly a vindicated. Isn't it enough to make our hearts burn within us? God bless you. [Luke 24:32], [Hebrews 1:3], [Exodus 20:18] 65-0801E, Events Made Clear By Prophecy, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 112 min\n\nL-161 Now with one accord, let's stand and say: I now accept Jesus Christ as Saviour and Healer. [Congregation says, \"I now accept Jesus Christ as Saviour and Healer.\"--Ed.] And by His grace, [\"And by His grace,\"] from this hour henceforth, [\"from this hour henceforth,\"] O God, [\"O God,\"] let no unbelief [\"let no unbelief\"] ever enter my heart, [\"ever enter my heart,\"] for I have seen [\"for I have seen\"] the prophecy [\"the prophecy\"] of this day [\"of this day\"] fulfilled.

We praise Thee, the Mighty One, the God of the prophets. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Oh, what a moment, what a time! ... only believe; Only believe, just only believe, All things are possible, only believe. May we sing it like this. Now I believe, oh, now I believe, All things are possible, now I believe; Now I believe, oh, now I believe, All things are possible, now I believe. Is that your testimony? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now as we bow our heads. Till we meet! till we meet! Till we meet at Jesus' feet; Till we meet! till we meet! God be with you till we meet again! [Brother Branham begins humming God Be With You. Then he says to Brother Neville, \"Do you want to say something?\"--Ed.] Vayle. ... at Jesus feet; Till we meet! till we meet!

Brother Lee Vayle, he's a writer for the tabernacle here, of the literature and books, and so forth. Very precious brother, he's been with me in many campaigns. Wish I had a chance to let every minister, get them up here and talk to them. You understand, I'm sure. Every minister, we're glad to have you here. All the laity, the people of different churches, whatmore, we're glad to have you here. And it's truly our prayer to one another, \"God be with you till we meet again.\" With our heads bowed, and our hands raised, let's sing it again real sweetly to God. Till we meet! till we meet!

And when we leave the building, may we say like those coming from Emmaus, \"Did not our hearts burn within us as He spoke to us this morning?\" Grant these things, Eternal God, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Be seated.

Tabernacle is packed, out into the yards and around the walls. We're under great expectations for the Lord to visit us today. And we hope that God has give you a 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min fine day wherever you are. And it is a good day, for the Lord has given it. No matter what the weather is, it's a good day. We're happy to be here, happy yet that we have the opportunity to express to the world our faith in Jesus Christ. And we want to take every opportunity we can to give our expressions of His love and what He's done for us. Today we are...\n\nL-7 I was given, a few moments ago, a--an announcement to make, and then I've got a few things here I'd like to say. And one of them, the announcement was given me concerning a board meeting the other night. And there's been one deacon from the church that's took up resident in Arizona, which is Brother Collins, our noble brother. And while he's away, they, the board, has appointed Brother Charlie Cox to take his place while he's gone. And Brother Charlie Cox is officially appointed by the trustee... or the deacon board of this church, to take the office of Brother Collins, in his absence.\n\nL-8 And a thing I want to say, again, I want to thank all you people, 'cause some of you may go home before the healing service tonight, for the nice little gifts, tokens. Much food has been brought to us since we been here. And from my wife and I, and my family, we certainly appreciate it. Sometimes I forget to even say anything about it. It's so busy, you know. My mind is in such a whirl all the time. You can imagine what it is, of people, not only from right here at this church, but from around the world. See? And it sort of keeps thee in a whirl all the time.\n\nL-9 Someone was saying about the dedication of the babies, and baptismal services, and so forth. That's very fine. Wish I could do it, but it's just so twisting, I--I hardly have time. I got to keep my mind right on this, this Message. You know the Bible said to the apostles, or... The apostles, rather, in the Bible, said, \"Go, look yourself out, among you, men of good report, and honest and filled with the Holy Ghost, that they might attend to the affairs.\" And I told Billy... He said, \"You going to dedicate the baby this time, daddy?\" I said, \"Oh, my!\" See? If... We got many of them waiting to be dedicated, and that's right, I'll just have to come back and take a special day for dedication of babies. So I'd like to do that, now. [Acts 6:3]\n\nL-10 But we want to thank each one of you from our hearts; wife, I, and our family. The people bring us canned goods, fresh butterbeans, watermelons, cantaloupes, oh, strawberries. Just anything could be thought of, they bring it.\n\nL-11 A precious brother and his sister, the other day, brought us a great big turkey. I'm still eating on it. And so just... Oh, and I'll have to clean it up before I leave, I guess. So if I don't, she'll take it right with us. And so--so we'll... We are certainly appreciative of these things. I know many of the people; some of them I don't know. They'll be laying on the porch when we come in. And so I certainly appreciate it. And many I know. I've got... I've seen many, and there's many that I don't get to see. I--I'm sure that everybody understands that I--I'd like to get to every one if I could, but I'm only one. See? To... I can't get to everyone. I'm doing everything I know how to do it.\n\nL-12 So, God be with you. I'm sure that there's One that will be with you; that's Jesus Christ, and He can be. He's the only Person that's omnipresent. And He's also omnipotent, so He can supply every need. And, omniscient, also, knows your needs, of what you have need of.\n\nL-13 I command everyone that I will not... I've been getting just as fast as I could, even since I been here this morning, and I'll get everyone that I can. And if... What I miss, the omnipotent God will--will supply all your needs according to His riches in Glory. [Philippians 4:19]\n\nL-14 [Brother Branham pauses, then speaks to Brother Neville--Ed.] I can't read that too well. Will you read it? It's a special announcement of some sort. And I think Billy Paul must have wrote it. So he's like me; I can't even read my own writing. And so I have a shorthand all of my own. And if you'd see some of my texts here, wrote on here, you think you'd ever understand that? [Brother Branham shows his written text to the congregation, and he laughs with them--Ed.] I have like a star, crossing a bridge, and so forth, just all... [Brother Neville reads an announcement--Ed.] Brother Adair, Adair of Arkansas, to see Rev. Pearry Green at the back of the church immediately. All right.\n\nL-15 Now, so another thing that I would--would like to announce here is--is that, this tonight now for the healing 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min services. We're going to pray for the sick tonight, and so I--I trust that you'll be here.\n\nL-16 And we send the greetings to all the people out across the land, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, that God will bless you this morning. Some of you are up towards noon. Up in New York, it is about noontime. And out in Arizona, the West Coast, it's only about seven o'clock. So there's... And here we're right in between. So God bless you as you listen. Now this may be... I've took it upon my heart, while being here...\n\nL-17 And was not allowed to have the auditoriums, and finally they kind of give us permission; we could have one service, but we should not pray for any sick. I--I don't... That's my ministry. I have to do what the Holy Spirit tells me to do. So I--I refused it, because that I want to be at liberty to do whatever the Holy Spirit says do. See? So I thought we can just suffer one more day, anyhow, in the tabernacle. And it's cool this morning. The Lord has just made a fine day for us here, so we're thankful.\n\nL-18 Now, in doing this, I have come here for the purpose of teaching the last Vials, last Seven Vials, and the last Seven Trumpets, and the last Seven Thunders, of the Book of Revelation, tying them together in this hour that we're now living; to follow the opening of the Seven Seals, the Seven Church Ages. So, we couldn't get room to do it. So I--I hope that, soon as I can, we'll... can get a place sufficient for that, either here or in Louisville, New Albany, or either put up a tent, so we can just stay as long as the Lord leads us to do.\n\nL-19 But in this now, I took this opportunity to express to the people my belief and faith in God, and then bringing you to the hour that we're living in. And by this, it's not appointed to any certain person, creeds, whatever it might be; it's just as I see God's Word. And last Sunday we had a very fine outpouring of the Spirit upon the Word. It was very lengthy, and I hated to stay that long; but yet we don't know what time that we're going to meet for our last time. And we must, as... want to be. I want to be, rather, as Paul said of old, \"I have not shunned to declare to you the whole Counsel of God.\" Jesus said He kept nothing back from His disciples. [Acts 20:27]\n\nL-20 And as I, so busy with trying to stay under the anointing of the Holy Spirit, to find what the--the hour, the Message of the hour is, I sometimes fail to get out and do my duties as a servant of Christ, as a minister. But I've got several men who try to help me to do this, to which I'm thankful for, all my minister brothers. , [Mark 4:22]\n\nL-21 Now, I don't mean to try to keep people. If you, out into the land where the Message is going, could stand and look around this church this morning, in the aisles, the nurseries, outside, radios on, in buses, trailers, and so forth, and automobiles, you would see what the problem is. And then each service, many, many driving by; and calling, and so forth, they couldn't get in or around. And we need more room so the people can set and be comfortable.\n\nL-22 And then to bring down to a--a Message that I think is so vital important, I feel that we ought to, every one, be comfortable and seated, and so we can listen; with our pencils and paper, and notes and Bible, and so forth, to take down the--the notes. But this way I thought I would go back on the time that we have, we're living in, and try to bring some of these things that you're going to meet. And you're going to need them.\n\nL-23 If I come here today, or any other day, or any other minister, to try to bring a message to a people, a dying people as we are, and the time so close at hand, as I believe for this day; I'd be a hypocrite to try to bring something that I know that you would be pleased with and it'd be against God's Word, or something to draw a crowd, or--or something like that; I--I wouldn't be... I wouldn't be what I--I'm here to be, a minister of Christ. I want to bring something that I think is a vital use to you, not just to be seen; but to think it's something that if I die today, tomorrow it'll be anchored in your heart to go on and serve God.\n\nL-24 Now I want to say that there is something just getting ready to happen. I know it. Many of you here remember when Brother Junior Jackson come to me a little bit before going towards Arizona, of a dream he had. Strange thing! How many remembers that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] And the Lord gave us the interpretation, and it happened to the letter. Now, he's just had another dream, something.\n\nL-25 And the strange thing, a man was here the other day, from Oregon. Doesn't hardly know me, and was... dreamed the same dream about, that Junior Jackson dreamed, and--and come told me. I--I don't know the interpretation; I'm 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min waiting for the Lord. But I know it's going to be something from God. Just remember that. It's THUS SAITH THE LORD. It's something coming forth from God. I don't know what it is. Really striking, very striking! Frankly, according to the--the dreams that both men... One of them I'd... he might be a Baptist, Presbyterian. He--he might be setting here this morning. I don't know. He was here the other day. I don't know the man.\n\nL-26 But he told the dream, with tears in his eyes. And it shook him. He come all the way from Oregon here, to express it. Brother Jackson come in like manner, this morning. One man not knowing the other; one, thousands of miles from the other, and both dreams just exactly on the same thing. So the Holy Spirit is withholding the interpretation thereof from me. I don't know what to tell the man. But I know God is fixing to do something, and it'll be glorious in our eyes.\n\nL-27 Now, the Message this morning, I want to read from the Book of Galatians. I don't preach or just... It's a Sunday school lesson. And now, you men and women that's standing along the walls, and somebody wants to swap and let you set down a while, or something, now, you won't bother me; just be reverently. And if the mothers, their little ones cry or something, someone will step out of the nursery so they can have room for the little one.\n\nL-28 And now you get your pencil, Bible, and ready for to take down some of the Scriptures that we will read. I don't want you to feel bound down. I want you to feel--I want you to feel at liberty to set and study. And you might disagree, which is all right. But I'm only speaking this across the nation this morning, so that the peoples that has believed the Message that the Lord Jesus has given me for this hour, might know what's taking place, and placing it in the Scripture.\n\nL-29 Last Sunday we spoke on The Anointed Ones In The Last Day. And if you, any of you, are tape listeners, be sure to get that tape. Not that we want to sell tapes; that isn't the idea. It's the idea of getting the Message out. See? See? If you've got a tape machine, get a group of people together, and play it, and listen close. \"The anointed ones.\"\n\nL-30 You hear people raise up and say, \"Oh, the Bible said, 'The last days, false prophets would rise and do these signs.'\" That's exactly the Scripture. Then where does that apply? It's got to be applied right. Tonight I want to speak on, if the Lord is willing, of: God Revealed In His Own Word, how that the eye cannot be applied where the ear ought to be. See? Just like printing the whole Bible, and, in the whole Bible, pictures Jesus Christ. So I want to speak on that tonight, the Lord willing. And now, if not, some later date. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-31 Now in the Book of Galatians. And in the Book of Second Corinthians 4:1 to 6, then Galatians 1:1 to 4, I wish to read some Scripture. Now in Galatians 1:1 to 4, \"Paul, an apostle,\" watch the stopping right quick. Apostle means \"one sent,\" or, \"a missionary.\" Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but... Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God... our Father: To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. [Galatians 1:1-4]\n\nL-32 Now in the Book of Second Corinthians, the 4th chapter, and we're going to read from 1 to 6, verses. Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel be hid, it's hid to them that are lost: If that don't bring in predestination, I don't know what does. In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. Same as it was at the garden of Eden, \"Put them forth, lest they touch that Tree.\" For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord;... ourselves your servants for Christ's sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, and give the light 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. [II Corinthians 4:1-6]\n\nL-33 Amen! So reads the Word! Now, my text this morning, is: The God Of This Evil Age. As we have read in the Scriptures, \"the god of this world, this evil age.\" Now, this Message points out the evils of this evil age, and it is fitting to prophecy for this evil age. And it's my belief that every... that the Bible has every answer for every age, already written in the Bible, for the believer of that age. I believe that everything that we have need of is written right Here, just needs to be interpreted by the Holy Spirit. I don't believe that any man on earth has a right to put his own interpretation to the Word. God doesn't need anybody to interpret His Word. He is His Own interpreter. He said He would do it, and He does it.\n\nL-34 As I've said many times. He said, \"A virgin shall conceive,\" He spoke that through the lips of a prophet, and she did. Nobody has to interpret that. In the beginning, He said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was. Nobody has to interpret It. He said, \"In the last days, He would pour out His Spirit upon all flesh,\" and He did. Don't need any interpret It. He said, \"In the last days, these things,\" that we see happening now, would be here. It don't need any interpreting. It's already interpreted. See? [Isaiah 7:14], [Matthew 1:23], [Genesis 1:3], [Acts 2:17]\n\nL-35 Now, notice closely now as we study the Word. The God Of This Evil Age, that we're now living. May seem strange, a very strange thing, in this age of grace, when, \"God is taking a people for His Name's sake,\" that is His Bride, in this evil age that should be called the age of evil. The very age that \"God is calling a people for His Name's sake,\" by grace, out, and is called an evil age. Now, we'll prove by the Bible that this is the age that He was speaking of. Very strange thing to think that, that in a evil age like this, that God then would be calling His Bride.\n\nL-36 You notice, He said, \"a people,\" not \"a church.\" Why? Yet, It's called the Church, but He would call \"a people.\" Now, a church is a gathering of many people of all different makeups. But God is calling one here... He didn't say, \"I'll call the Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal.\" He said He would call a people. What for? His Name. See, a people; one from the Methodist, one from the Baptist, one from the Lutheran, one from the Catholic. See? But He is calling, not a church group, but \"a people for His Name,\" that receives His Name, engaged in His Name, going to a wedding to be married to Him, to become part of Him, see, by a predestination. Just as a man that chooses a right wife in life, was ordained to be part of his body. So, that is, the Bride of Christ will be, and is now, from old, ordained by God to be a part of that Body. See? Oh, the Scriptures are so rich, full of honey! [Revelation 19:7-9], [Romans 8:29-31], [Ephesians 1:4-6]\n\nL-37 Notice, not what someone has said, what someone called; but what God chose before the foundation of the world, and is calling these people in the last days; not an organization. \"A people for His Name.\" And this evil age is when He's doing it, this very age of deception. [Matthew 25:34], [Matthew 24:24], [Ephesians 1:4], [Matthew 24:11]\n\nL-38 Last week, in Matthew 24, it was the most deceiving age of all ages. All the ages of deceit, from the garden of Eden, all the way down, there's never been an age so deceptive as this age. \"False prophets will rise and show signs and wonders, if possible to deceive the very Elected.\" See? Now, just a cold, formal, starchy churches, and so forth, of man-made theology, that wouldn't; the Elect would never pay no attention to that. But it's up there almost like the real thing. Just leaving out one Word is all you have to do. Promised of the age; very great time! Christians, everywhere, take heed to the hour we're living! Mark down, and read, and listen close. [Matthew 24:3-28]\n\nL-39 What would God call a people out of this evil age for, His Name? The reason it is, is to try Her, His Bride. It's to... When She is made manifest, been tried, been proven, proved to Satan. Like it was at the beginning, so shall it be at the end. [James 1:2-4], [Ephesians 6:16]\n\nL-40 As a seed starts in the ground, it comes up through carriers, the life of it, but it ends up the same seed that it was when it went in the ground. And the same way the seed of deceit fell in the ground, in Eden, is the same way it ends up in the last days. Just as the Gospel was when it fell to a denomination at Nicaea, Rome, it ends up in a super organization. Just as the Seed of the Church fell back there, with the signs, wonders, and the living Christ among them, it ends up in the last days under the ministry of Malachi 4, and restores back again the original Faith that was once given. [Malachi 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min 4:5-6]\n\nL-41 We find now, this evil age is to prove, to Satan, She is not like Eve, that She is not that type of a woman. And She will be tried by His Word, the Bride, as Adam's bride was tried by the Word. And Adam's bride believed every bit of the Word, all, but confused on one promise, that, \"He's the same yesterday, today, and forever,\" today, see; but failed on one promise, under the temptation of the enemy, face to face. And now, the people that's called for His Name, of course, is His Bride. She is to come in contact again by the same thing; not by just denominational truth or something, but every Word! [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-42 For, in the beginning of the Bible, man was given the Word of God to live by. One Word, misinterpreted by a--a man called Satan, in a person of an animal called the serpent. Satan, in this person, could talk to Eve, and misinterpreted the Word to her, and was lost. See, It must be every Word.\n\nL-43 In the middle of the Bible, Jesus come and said, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word,\" when He was tempted by Satan. Now, God telling us here in the last days, that, \"The god of this world will rise up in the last days.\" \"And whosoever shall add one word to It, or take one Word from It, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.\" God be merciful to us! And let us not walk as stiff shirts, chests stuck out, head up, know it all, for we too one time were in disobedience. Let us with grace, and mercy, and feeling in our heart towards God, humbly come to the Throne of grace. [Matthew 4:4], [Revelation 22:18-19]\n\nL-44 Strange now, after some nineteen hundred years of Gospel preaching, and now she, that is the world system, is more evil than in the days when that, when He was here. The world system is more evil. The world is heading to a great climax. You know that. The Lord is fulfilling His Word on every hand.\n\nL-45 Yesterday, standing... I hope the little fellow don't... He won't. I had come with my wife, and Mrs. Woods, Brother Roy Roberson, somewhere here, Brother Woods, we had stopped in over here at this little Youngstown Shopping Center, to get a--a package that Sister Woods had. And on... while we was standing there, a young fellow walked up and introduced himself, and a stranger to me. Another young man walked up and said they were from either Alabama, Georg-... I believe Georgia, 'cause I asked them if they knowed our Brother Welch Evans. And we talked a few minutes. And when I went to leave, this young man looked at me. As the young other fellow and his little boy walked away, this young man looked at me. He said, \"Just one thing I want to say.\" I said, \"Are--are you a believer? Are you a Christian?\" Said, \"No, sir.\" He said, \"I've...\"\n\nL-46 I might not quote just the word he said here, but he might have been a little skeptic. I had asked him about the things of the Angel of the Lord appearing. And he said he had heard about it, but he never been to church before, this church. I said, \"Do you believe It?\" Said, \"Yes, sir.\" He said, \"I--I been watching something.\" Said, \"People has been telling me about these predictions and things, and I heard on a tape that you predicted how California would crack away like that.\" And said, \"When I saw that in the paper, then I believed it.\" He said, \"I'm coming today or tomorrow,\" that's today, \"for my first time.\" I said, \"The Lord bless you, son,\" and started to shake his hand. He said, \"But I want to say something to you, sir.\" He said, \"I'm as lost as lost can be.\" He said, \"I'm like a coin in a sandpile, lost!\"\n\nL-47 I said, \"But you don't have to stay that way. There is Someone standing present now who can find you the minute that you're ready to be found.\" He said, \"I'm ready.\" I said, \"Would you bow your head?\" He said, \"I'm not ashamed.\" Not only that, but he got down on his knees, there in that parking lot, before all the peoples. People on the street watching him. There we prayed with him, till he gave God his heart. He come up, a sinner; went back, a child of God. He walked up the side of the car, dead; and went back, alive. 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min\n\nL-48 I said, \"The pool will be open tomorrow.\" There is a fountain filled with Blood, Drawn from Immanuel's veins, Where sinners plunged beneath the flood, Lose all their guilty stain. I said, \"Rise and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, calling upon the Name of the Lord. God will fill you with the Holy Spirit, and give to you these great things, and make you so you can see It.\" [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-49 What is it? The world is heading to a climax. Why? The spirit of lawlessness, moral decay, scientific religion, has led it to \"the cage of every hateful and unclean birds,\" as the Bible said. Let's read it, Revelation 18. Just while we're getting this point started, we get Revelation 18:1 to 5. I think I've got that marked right. And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, (now you people that had the dreams)... saying, Babylon the great is falling, is falling, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit,... a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drank of the wine of the wrath of her (church) fornications, and the kings of the earth have committed fornications with her, and the merchants of the earth has waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins,... that you receive not of her plagues. For her sin has reached unto heaven, and God remembers her iniquity. [Revelation 18:1-5]\n\nL-50 What a warning! That throws the church exactly back to Revelations 3:14, to the Laodicean age, lawlessness; real religious, but lawlessness. \"Thou, because thou sayest that, 'We are rich, have need of nothing,' knowest thou not that thou art naked, miserable, blind, and knows it not.\" Perfectly with the Scripture of this age, not for the Scripture of the age of Daniel, not for the ones in the name of... the age of Noah, but in this last, evil age. [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-51 Notice here, \"Thou art naked.\" Let that soak real deep. I know I may have much disagreement on this thought, but it's got to a place that a Christian can hardly walk out of his house and not be brought in the presence of this evil age, by unsufficient dressed women.\n\nL-52 Women, I'm going to say this, and I want you to listen. And, men and women, you might disagree with this, but I feel led to say it. Did you know, any woman that undresses herself like that is not in her right mind? Do you know, she is, whether she believes it or not, or thinks not, she is a prostitute? Though the woman might stand with her hand before God and swear that she's never been touched by any other man but her husband, and that might be the honest truth, but still she is a prostitute. Jesus said, \"Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already.\" And the woman may be... [Matthew 5:28]\n\nL-53 See, she is \"naked,\" the Bible said, \"and don't know it.\" The spirit that's anointing her to do such things is a evil, prostitute spirit. Her outward being, her physical body, her flesh, she might be clean. She might not commit any adultery, and could swear to God and be the truth, that she never, but her spirit is a prostitute spirit. She has been so blinded by the god of this world of fashion; she dressed herself sexy and got out there.\n\nL-54 The other day, Brother Woods and I were putting our boat in the river. I was to get away from the house for a few minutes, to go up on the river. And wherever you went, women with these little bunches of... called 'kinis or something, around them. That is a disgrace. A woman can't be in her right mind and put on anything like that. She is possessed with a prostitute spirit. Now, you settle that with God, lady, 'cause you'll find out someday that that is the Truth.\n\nL-55 How could you, a lady, knowing how sacred your body is, and expose it out there to these lustful, sinful devils that walk the street of this day? If sons of God was all still sons of God, your husband was a son of God, he would either make you put on clothes or leave you. If a boy was a son of God, he would never marry such a thing. See? You say, \"You're mak-...\" No. 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min I'm telling you the Truth, and someday you'll meet It. \"Naked, adulteress; don't know it.\"\n\nL-56 \"Oh, I swear that I never trespassed the vows of my husband.\" Your husband will judge you for it if you did. But God will judge you by what kind of a spirit you got in you; not judge you by your body, but by your spirit, that inner man.\n\nL-57 The outside man is a physical being which is controlled by six senses... or five senses, rather. The inside man is a spirit man which is controlled by five senses; conscience, and love, and so forth. The outside man; see, taste, feel, smell, hear. But the inside of that spirit is a soul, and it's controlled by one thing, your free will. You can accept what the devil says or accept what God says. And that'll determine what spirit is in there. If it's the Spirit of God, It'll feed on the things of God, and It won't feed on anything of the world. Jesus said, \"If you love the world or the things of the world, it's because the love of God has not even entered this inner part.\" Satan has deceived you. \"And man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" Notice now, we find that she is \"naked,\" lewd and nude. [I John 2:15]\n\nL-58 And the world seems to be in the most evil age that ever was. Never in any age did women ever act like that, never but just before the destruction of the antediluvian world. And Jesus referred to it. We'll get to that after a while.\n\nL-59 Has God lost control, or is He just permitting another agency to control? I wonder. The true answer to this question is, to my opinion, there is two opposing spirits in the world today, at work. Now, there can't be no more than two, two heads. And One of them is the Holy Spirit at work; the other one is the spirit of the devil, and, in this last days, in deception. Now I'm going to base my thoughts right on here for the rest of the text, the rest of the... our Message.\n\nL-60 The two spirits. One of them, God's Holy Spirit; the other one, the devil's spirit, working in deception. The people of the earth are now making their choice. The Holy Spirit is here calling out a Bride for Christ. He is doing it by vindicating His Word of promise to Her, for this age, showing that It is Christ. If the finger is supposed to move in this age, the finger will move. If the foot is supposed to move in this age, the foot will move. If the eye is to see in this age, the eye will see. See? The Spirit of God, as It's growed into the full statue of God, is the age that we're now living in. The Holy Spirit is here vindicating the Message of the hour. And the Holy Spirit is doing this, so that the people that believe God will be called out of this chaos. The Devil's unholy spirit is here calling his church by the error, as usual, by perversion of the Word of God, like he did at the beginning. See it coming right back to that seed time again, from Eden? Here it is again.\n\nL-61 Now, back through there, you belong-... other ages, you belonged to denominations, you belonged to this, that, or the other. What happened to the denominational stalk? It dries up. The Spirit keeps leaving and going on, and It heads up in a Seed. You see?\n\nL-62 And the temptation, of both, heads back the same way it was at the beginning. Notice. Don't--don't, no, don't forget it now. As John, First John 4:5 and 6, if you want to put that down, he puts it, \"the spirit of error.\" Eve never just simply walked out, willfully, say, \"I don't believe in God.\" No. It was an error she believed. [I John 4:5-6]\n\nL-63 Satan never come out and said, \"Oh, well, that's not even the Word of God.\" He admitted It was the Word of God, but he put his own interpretation to It. Which, God plainly told them not to do it. What does this do? \"It makes a strong delusion, for the people to believe a lie, and be damned by it.\" Now if you want to read that, Second Thessalonians 2:11. [II Thessalonians 2:11]\n\nL-64 As I have about, quite a few Scriptures here, and we won't be able to read them all. One now and then, I'll give them to you. As it seems strange, that you question it or something, and we might put it down and read for your--your good. 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min\n\nL-65 \"Making a strong delusion,\" as the Bible said it would, Second Thessalonians. \"Now, this man of sin would come into existence, and set in the temple of God, showing himself he was God, and cause the people to go into strong delusions, to believe a lie; and, believe it, will be damned by it.\" That's the same thing he did to Eve. Give her... Never--never told her the Word wasn't right, but give her a strong delusion, that she believed a lie.\n\nL-66 The spirit of delusion is of the devil. \"Devils now working in the children of disobedient.\" Disobedient to what? What's the children of this day disobedient to? Like Eve was, at the beginning, the true Word of God. That's right. Now if you would want to get that... Let's turn to it, Ephesians 2, just a minute, 'cause it seems good that we... I'll stop just a minute, if you're in no big hurry, and read some of this. Ephesians 2:1 to 2. And you has he quickened, who were once dead in trespasses and sin: Wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:\n\nL-67 \"Children of disobedience.\" And if the antichrist, beginning there in the infancy of disobedience, what will it be when it heads up in the person of the antichrist? How deceptive it'll be! How much more powerful of deception could a--an adult give to the world, than an infant child! And he said, \"The spirit of--of delusion now working in the children of disobedient,\" disobedient to the Word. Notice. Now I want to dwell on this just a minute, \"the children of disobedient,\" a child.\n\nL-68 Did you know, you, your beginning, I can prove by God's Word that you, any person in here, was alive in your great-grandfather. And your great-grandfather, you were produced down to your grandfather, then to your father, and then to you. You know that? The Bible said, I believe it's Hebrews 7, that, Melchisedec, when Abraham returned from the slaughter of the kings, \"Abraham paid Melchisedec tithing of all the spoils.\" And here is Paul saying now, that, \"Levi, who received tithes, was yet... He paid tithes, for he was yet in the loins of Abraham when he met Melchisedec.\" So whatever that Abraham did, then we find that Levi was then in Abraham, which was his great-grandfather. Abraham begot Isaac; Isaac begot Jacob; Jacob begot the patriarchs, Levi. Now, then, you see, here comes into perfect view, predestination. [Hebrews 7:1-2], [Hebrews 7:5]\n\nL-69 Now, in these Messages, I want to--to--to emphasize the things that I have told you in the Message, of this evening Light that God said would come upon the earth.\n\nL-70 And notice, then, \"The beast that was to come upon the earth, would deceive all whose names were not put in the Lamb's Book of Life, slain before the foundation of the world.\" [Revelation 13:8]\n\nL-71 In God's own thinking; God, the great Spirit. In the beginning, before there was a beginning, He was God, and did you know you were in Him then? If you are a Christian now, you was in Him then. And then, if that be so, the whole Godhead bodily shaped up in the Person of Jesus Christ. And then when Jesus died at the cross, I died with Him, for I was in Him then; for He was the fullness of the Word, manifested, knowing that we would be manifested later. And we was at Calvary with Him. We went in the grave with Him. And we raised with Him and His resurrection. And now we've ascended, by His Spirit, to the Throne of grace, sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Always!\n\nL-72 For as the germ of natural life is brought down, germitized from father to father, to father, to father, so is the Life of Christ germatized. That's the reason God uses Elijah's Spirit five different times. What is it? It's the handing down.\n\nL-73 Just as your natural life and traits is handed down from the natural breeding of your father, so is the Spirit of God, that was predestinated before the foundation of the world. And when the entire Word of God, in complete, was headed up in a human body called Jesus Christ, in there God made me pay for my sins, in Him there. Then He rose me, raised me up with Him, in the resurrection. And now we are seated 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min with Him, with power and authority over every devil. Oh, if you could only believe what God has given! But if you're not seated there, you don't have it. And if you're seated there, and don't believe it, and afraid to move, you'll never use it. But if you are seated there, you will use it, for you're ordained to do what you do.\n\nL-74 \"Pharaoh,\" on the other side, \"was raised up for this purpose,\" the Bible said, to be Pharaoh. \"Judas Iscariot was raised up to be the son of perdition.\" Now notice these great Truths that we are approaching. [Romans 9:17]\n\nL-75 Now we see that the church refused to accept God's Word to rule over them, and accepted Barabbas instead. Now, if you want the Scripture on that, it's Matthew 27:15 to 23. What did this do? What position did this do? Now think of it. When the church world, in its organized life of righteous, holy men, as they thought they were, and were in the eyes of the people, they crucified Jesus, and said, \"We'll not have this Man rule over us.\" And Jesus was the fullness of the Word of God. First John 1, expresses it. And they said, \"We'll not have this Word of God to rule over us.\" Yet, He was the Word, but their eyes were blinded to what He was. For He was the direct answer to every prophecy that was to come to pass in Him. Now, we all believe that, because we're looking back to see it happen. But if the world would, that is now, this present evil age, that would have been back there at that time, they would do the same thing they're doing today, because it's still the same Word, for this age, being manifested. He'll do it. They can't do nothing else. \"They are children of disobedience.\" \"Given a strong delusion, to believe a lie, and be damned by it.\" [Matthew 27:15-23], [I John 1:1], [Matthew 27:21]\n\nL-76 Notice when the church world would not accept Jesus, the Word, manifested of that day, because (why?) they had It interpreted another way. But they ought to have knowed that He was that Word, because everything that God said He would do, He did it. And He said to them, \"Search the Scriptures for this hour; and if I do not meet the qualification that was spoke for Me to do, then don't believe Me.\" They said, \"We believe Moses.\" [John 5:39]\n\nL-77 He said, \"If you would have believed Moses, you would have believed Me, for Moses spoke of Me.\" And still they didn't see it. The very God of Heaven dying on the cross, and saying the same words the prophet said He would say, and still they didn't see it. See? They were not of His kind. They was not the Word, not the Word; and they, yet, they were--were very religious. But they was not the Word, for It--It would a recognized Its place for that hour. [John 5:46-47]\n\nL-78 Notice how beautiful the Scriptures tie themselves together in every age. Notice now. And when the church world would not have the Word of God to rule over them, they accepted a murderer, Barabbas. What did this do? It exalted Satan, the god of this evil age, to the place that he's always wanted. Now listen. For, Satan is not spoke of as a god of any other age but this age. He wasn't spoke of the god of the age of Noah. He wasn't spoke of--of the god of the age of Moses, the god of the age of Elijah. But, this evil age, he is the... Oh, don't miss it! He is the god of this evil age, worshiped by millions and billions of people, and they don't know it. But let's let the Scripture uncover him this morning, and let's see, then you'll know. Let the Scripture...\n\nL-79 As in the meetings of discernment, when the Holy Spirit gets among His Word and He calls out this man and said, \"You have no business living with this other woman. What did you do that for, ten years ago, when you run off with that man's wife?\" What's He doing? Uncovering him, exposing Satan, that's got the man bound, or the woman living with some other woman's husband, or the sins that they've done, the things that they have done. What does it do? Expose him.\n\nL-80 The doctors take instruments and try to find what's wrong. They can't do it. We can't tell. But then the Holy Spirit comes out and reveals what he is, and exposes him. See? That's what the Word of God is. It is a Light that shines in darkness. And when you take a noise in the room, it sounds mysterious; a bunch of something working, and you don't know what it is. Turn on the light, quickly... Crickets, roaches, they're--they are children of the darkness. And when the light flashes, they scatter away. 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min \"They went out from us because they wasn't of us,\" the Bible said. See? They cannot live in the Light of the world... For, the God of Heaven has sent His Light in this last days, that He might lighten the path for His children, that they might not walk in darkness and stumble, but they might walk in the Light of the shining of Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen! [I John 2:19], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-81 Notice, Satan not called the god of any other age but this age. It was his ambition to be like God, from the very beginning. Let's read that. We'll just take our time. Let's go back to... See, I got it wrote down, Isaiah 14. Let's go back here to Isaiah 14, just a minute, and see what God said. \"The god,\" what Satan did. Isaiah 14:12 and 14. Notice. How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cast down to the ground, which did weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God (sons of God, now): and I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: [Isaiah 14:12, 13]\n\nL-82 It was Satan's ambition to be worshiped like God. He took two-thirds, two-thirds of the stars of Heaven. Ascended hisself above those stars, and preached to them, and deceived two-thirds of them. You see it? All right. Notice, that's his ambition. And now he is ready, with his careful selected, educated bride by his own knowledge, see, all painted up in his deceit, of big buildings and big denominations, and paints of knowledge and theology, and smart and intellectual, and educated, to deceive the whole world, and become a \"god.\" That's what he's done. All heading up into the person of the antichrist, which is already crowned \"the vicar of God,\" by his worldly-loving, scientific bride, all dressed up in pomp of intellectual, religious education. She is made religious like him, and by his own interpretation of the Word of God as he did Eve, and as his son Cain did. Now you said, \"Satan's son?\"\n\nL-83 Show me one place in the Bible that Cain was ever called Adam's son. The Bible said he was \"the son of that evil one,\" serpent's seed. No, the cover has been took off now, brother. The pyramid has been opened, as the revelation showed.\n\nL-84 Notice what he will do, his thoughts. He thought God dwelled in worldly beauty. He did that in Heaven. Sin never begin in the garden of Eden; it begin in Heaven, when Lucifer, the son of the morning, exalted himself in beauty, and wanted a more beautiful kingdom than that of Michael. And he thought that God dwelt in beauty.\n\nL-85 And notice Cain. He didn't want no blood sacrifice. He come down and offered the fruit, or--or the fields of beauty upon his altar. Very religious, done everything, that, just exactly like Abel done; offered a sacrifice, fell down before God in worship, obedient in every way, but without the revelation of the Word. And the Word was, from the beginning, God's plan. But God revealed, by revelation, the very thing that He vindicated and punctuated that that was right. Not religion, not an altar, not belonging to church, not making a sacrifice, not being sincere; but by the revelation of the Word of God. God revealing to him what that it... His mother did not take a apple that a snake give her, but she had a sexual affair with the person of Satan, in the form of the beast; not a reptile, but the most smartest, subtlest of all the field, the image of man, the only thing that the seed would mix in. Now science is trying to find him. And they never will find him, because every bone in his body is changed. But the Bible declares it to be so. [Genesis 4:3], [Genesis 4:4], [Genesis 3:14]\n\nL-86 Notice what this fellow will do now. This fellow, \"He will set in the temple of God,\" that is, the church, \"revealing himself to be God.\" Now if you want to read that, that's Second Thessalonians 2:3 and 4, and Revelation 13:4, 11 and 12; where spoke, both prophets, both John and Paul, of what he would be in the last days. Now you read it, because I've got wrote down here. But I... to save time now. [II Thessalonians 2:3-4], [Revelation 13:4, 11, 12]\n\nL-87 The day we are living is called, in the Bible, \"the day of man,\" man's day. This is not God's day. God is not the god of this earth; the Bible says He isn't. He's the God of Heaven. But this is not God's day. This is choosing day. Either, live for today, and die; choose God, and live. And God is the Word, and the Word is the Word manifested for the hour and the day. [John 1:1] 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min\n\nL-88 Notice, \"the day of man.\" If you want to put that down, I was going to read it. But First Corinthians 5:1-5... First Corinthians 4:1-5, pardon me, First Corinthians 4:1 and 5, was Paul speaking of being judged by man, in man's day. [I Corinthians 4:1-5]\n\nL-89 \"The day, what do you call it the man's day for?\" you would say. It's the day that the works by the knowledge of man is glorified. Look what, all the brag of the communists, somebody trying to get somebody to the moon. God is trying to get somebody to Heaven. See? But look how they're spending millions and billions and trillions of dollars, in a wasted effort. When they get there, they ain't going to find nothing. What's the matter with them? I don't care about the moon. I want to pass the moon so fast I won't even see it; just keep going higher. I want to pass the Milky White Way, go on, just keep going. Yes!\n\nL-90 And the world today is dedicating themselves to the knowledge which came by Satan. And man's day is glorified, not by the Word of God, but by the knowledge that he has. Now think. Let that soak in. And when you play this tape back, on this point here, stop for a while and think. His works are exalted above God's Word and manifested works; the wisdom of Satan, which he give to Eve at the beginning. Now listen; don't miss this. The wisdom of Satan is exalted to the throne of worship, in man, above the vindicated Word of God for the hour. Our churches proves that by their--their seminaries, schools of learning, that's learnt more than God's Word knows about It, they think. And there, Doctor So-and-so, and Teacher So-and-so, and Professor So-and-so has exalted their own knowledge, so-called (from Satan) truth, above the vindicated promise of God, made clear right before them. And man fall for it. See? [Isaiah 14:12-15]\n\nL-91 His scientific achievements, trying to prove God's Word wrong. Just think of that. He, his, that is, the man's theology, explains God's Word to the people, and makes It of no effect again, like he had it in the denominational age when Jesus appeared on the earth. Jesus said, \"You hypocrites! You, by your tradition,\" that's their interpretation, \"has took the Word of God and made It of no effect to the people.\" And that's the same thing they've done today. It doesn't have the effect. [Matthew 15:6], [Mark 7:13]\n\nL-92 Notice, \"They,\" the people, \"exalt him above all that's called God.\" Don't Second Thessalonians say they would do it? And the authority of a denominational church, the people believing that denomination more than they believe God. And God is the Word. They'll believe their denominational creed above the Word, which \"exalts him above all that's called God.\" And there's only one God, and that's the Word. \"All that's called God; so he as God sets in the church of the God, proving that he is God,\" because he's got the people worshiping him. God is the Word. And he exalts himself above all that's called God. And there's only one God, and that God is the Word. See? \"And all that's called God,\" is, the god of this age has exalted himself above the true, vindicated Word of God. That's Saint John 1. See? \"Above all that's called God, so that he as God sets in the temple of God,\" with authority. Look, and he is praised for it! Oh, let the people, God, see that deception! He is praised for it, and solemnly believed by the people of this evil age. Now do you see the god and his servants of this evil age? [II Thessalonians 2:4], [John 10:30]\n\nL-93 Now let's watch it be manifested. He says he is making a better world for them to live in, by his knowledge apart from the never-failing Word of God. But by his coming together, in denominations, and creeds, and intellectual, and scientific, and so forth, he is making a better world for man to live in, and ignoring the promise of God, that the only time the world will be fit to live in is in the Millennium. You know, my opinion, he's made a better world to sin in instead of live in.\n\nL-94 Notice. Did he do it? He legalized sin. He legalized whiskey drinking, cigarette smoking. And in the churches, legalized that a woman could be a member of the church, with short hair. Now may you stop just a minute.\n\nL-95 She can wear shorts, wear paints, and still belong to his religious group, which is absolutely contrary to the Word of God. He says it's all right. See his knowledge? \"What's that got to do with a woman?\" Just the same as taking the forbidden fruit, or not the forbidden fruit, that's what it is. God said not to do it, but he does it. [Genesis 2:17] 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min\n\nL-96 And she believes him, and she loves him for it. She hates God. Her own actions prove she does. She says she loves Him, but she loves Satan. She worships the god of fashion, the god of the world, the Hollywood goddesses. She loves him, but she hates the true Word of God, which is the only true God there is. Legalizes it in the churches. \"There's no harm. Our women can do this, that, or the other.\" But in the Presence of the living God, she's not even permitted to come, 'less she's repenting.\n\nL-97 Sees, he is the god of worldly beauty, he is. She wants to look beautiful. And he is the god of beauty, from the beginning. He can, and has achieved by his knowledge in science and materials, to make beauty for his, this model age... this modern age, rather, of evil. It's made beauty.\n\nL-98 Notice. It's noteworthy to notice. At the beginning, Seth and his children never went the scientific way. Now we're going to talk about science for a few minutes. If I say this, not excusing my ignorance; but, a bunch of ignoramuses, anything that'll deny the Word of God. See? Sure. It's noteworthy. Watch it. Seth's children never went the scientific route. They were humble herdsmen, farmers, and so forth. But Cain's children did. Why? Inspired by their daddy, the devil. Cain, inspired by his daddy, the devil, and these inspired by that seed coming down. [Genesis 5:29]\n\nL-99 Watch the seed of God coming down through every age, and watch where it's heading up today. Christians, genuine Christians, are not all about scientific research and stuff. No. Just a minute, we'll get into that. But Cain's did, after the nature of their father, the devil, full of worldly knowledge, beauty, and science, so forth. Cain's children was scientific. They were educated. They was the players of music--music instruments; a modern Elvis Presley, some of this stuff like that the school board lets happen up here in the lane every Saturday night. Builders of city, beautifying women for personal lusts, as the devil giving women paint, and bobbing their hair, and put them in the shorts, and things like that. They, it's for his own dirty lusts. That's pretty flat, but I don't know any other way to say it. [Genesis 4:21, 22]\n\nL-100 Now, we know that Satan's gospel is a gospel of science and progress. He preached it in Eden; not God; Satan did, the science of progress. Science and progress is Satan's gospel. Look where he's led us to today, with it. See?\n\nL-101 Notice, he preached it in Eden, to who? To Adam's bride. And she fell for it. He deceived her into questioning one of God's Words. Let's see what he might have said. He must have said, \"It is not scientific to die, in this holy church.\" Or, \"You will be schooled and educated, not to believe in such unreasonable things as death. I don't care if God's Word did say it; it's unreasonable.\" [Genesis 3:1, 4]\n\nL-102 Oh, look at him today. \"God is a good God. You're in His holy church; why, you cannot die.\" But God said you would, and that settles it. See him today? \"Oh, just belong to church. It ain't what you do, or this, that, or the other. Just come to church and be a good member. Cutting your hair, that's nonsense. And wearing shorts, and putting on paint, and going to dances, and a little beer once in a while, won't hurt you, as long as you don't indulge in it. Frankly, I wish you children would take it, so that they could learn whether they liked it or not.\" There he is, the god of this age, this evil age.\n\nL-103 \"God is a good God.\" I've heard that so much till I get sick. God is also a God of justice. He ain't an old dotty grandpa that can be pushed around, and His grandkids don't have any sin. He's a God of justice and holiness. He proved it in the garden of Eden, by His first children. You cross that line, of one of His Words, you're dead. Same thing applies today. [Genesis 3:3]\n\nL-104 And notice, he preached that kind of a scientific, social, educated, progressive gospel to Eve, and Adam's bride believed it. And he has succeeded in filling the so-called bride of Christ, the church of the Second Adam, with the same arguments. That's right.\n\nL-105 \"Oh, it's not--it's not for God; God is too good to do it. Why, as long as you go to church. 'If thou believest.'\" The devil believes; not make-believes, but he actually believes. He is not saved. \"'If thou believest.'\" Huh! [James 2:19]\n\nL-106 He tells the second bride, or the Second Adam's Bride, the same as he told the first. Such as, \"Now, Divine 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min healing, there is no such thing. We can prove that. There's never been a case proved.\" \"And this baptism in Jesus' Name, now don't you realize that I'm the authority of the church?\" he says. \"We've settled that at Nicaea, Rome,\" when them three unclean spirits went out of the dragon, the false prophets, and so forth. \"We believe there is a trinity of Gods.\" Oh, for goodness' sakes! That's as heathen as can be. Don't you never come before God with such a thing as that, try to stand in His Presence. \"Oh, it don't make any difference if you are baptized in the titles of 'Father, Son, Holy Ghost.' What difference does it make?\"\n\nL-107 It made so much difference, until Paul commanded a bunch of Baptists that they had to be rebaptized in the Name of Jesus Christ before the Holy Ghost would ever come on them. And also caused that apostle to scream out, and said, \"If a angel comes from Heaven and preaches anything else, let him be cursed.\" Sure, it makes a difference. Oh, my! [Acts 2:38], [Galatians 1:8]\n\nL-108 \"There is no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost in these days. That was only for the apostles. It's passed. And such a thing as prophets? It's not even known of. Miracles? They're unscientific. Malachi 4? That was for another age. John 14:12? Oh, Jesus didn't really mean that. Luke 17:30? Oh, that was just a myth. See, it--it's misinterpreted; it wasn't in the original.\" Such tommyrot! When God Almighty comes down in our midst and proves it. When He says, that, \"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever,\" He proves that so. I don't care who says not about it; God interprets His Own Word. He said He would do this thing in the last days. \"There will be Light in the evening time.\" And there is Light, for the manifestation of the Son of God. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-109 The same sun that rises in the east is the same sun that sets in the west. The prophet said, \"There will be a day that couldn't be called day nor night.\" It's a dismal, the clouds, as over the face of the sun. But said, \"About evening time it shall come Light again.\" The same Son! He is Alpha and Omega. Same Son that rose in the east was predicted to rise in the west again, in the last days, just before the day was over. I don't know how they interpret It; God interprets His Own Word. He proves It. This is the evening time. [Zechariah 14:7]\n\nL-110 It's sad, but she sure fell for it again. Christ's bride fell for it, and took the intellectual knowledge of some seminary preacher instead of believing the pure, vindicated Word of God.\n\nL-111 Now ministers out yonder in the land wherever you are, you might disagree with This. I'm not hurting you. I'm just try-... I'm talking to my own group. I'm just trying... If you want to set in, I'll sure be glad for you to hear It. And then you listen at It. See? But I'm just telling them what they have--what they have seen, and showing it to them; God proving it, that it's right. See? This is the hour. Don't need anybody to interpret It. Your worldly knowledge don't have anything... You might have a B.A., D.D., A.D., or whatever it might be; it don't mean one thing. God interprets His Word, Himself. He promised it, and here it is.\n\nL-112 But by the knowledge of seminary, denominational preaching, \"has caused the whole world to wonder after the beast whose deadly wound was healed,\" from pagan to papal. See where she's heading up? She believes it. She believes the knowledge that he tells her.\n\nL-113 It is, now watch, it is that both engaged brides believed Satan's knowledge against God's Word. The bride of Adam believed Satan's knowledge against God's Word, and the bride of Christ has believed Satan's knowledge, in this intellectual evil age, against God's Word. And notice. Eve, in the natural, that believed it, and plunged the whole human race to death. The natural bride! Adam, the natural man of the earth; his bride, before he got to her, to be wife, plunged the whole human race into death. Whether it's scientific or not, we die just the same, 'cause God said we would. Whether you're in holy Eden, or holy church, or holy denomination, or whatever it might be, you'll die the day you disbelieve one Word of God's Word to be the Truth, when It's vindicated and proved to you. That's the day you separate yourself from God. Not just the whole sentence; one Word. \"Whosoever shall add one word, or take One away,\" that's the day you die. [Genesis 2:16-17], [Genesis 3:4, 5, 6], [Revelation 22:18-19] 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min\n\nL-114 Notice, Adam's bride caused natural death to her race, the human race. And the Second Adam's bride, Christ's engaged bride, has plunged the whole church to a denominational death, to take the mark of the beast, by the scientific, intellectual, big denominations. \"We are Baptists. We are Presbyterian. We are Pentecostals,\" and so forth. \"We got this, and we own more property. We, we are noted by the government. We're all around the world,\" and all such things. \"And the best, and the mayor of the city, and so forth, comes to us. Even the President comes to have mass said with us, and we comes to this, that, or the other.\" The whole world has been plunged to a spiritual, denominational death; the whole church. She is dead! You say, \"You're covering a lot of territory.\"\n\nL-115 Jesus said, \"As it was in the days of Noah, wherein eight souls were saved, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man.\" \"In the days of Lot, where three was brought out of Sodom, at that day...\" Now there's already a group already out, remember. \"But, as it was then, when the Son of man will be manifested.\" Look what a day, look where we're living! [Matthew 24:37], [Luke 17:29-30]\n\nL-116 Now she has caused the whole world to accept the scientific leadership of the educational program that Satan has given to her under the name of a church, the leadership of a educational, scientific program. I'm picturing to you the god of this world. When she, as Eve, had the very filling of God's Word in her hand, she could have took God's Word. But what did she do to That? Instead of tarrying for the baptism of the Holy Ghost, let science prove to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples. Instead of keeping Divine healing going, when she ought to be now raising the dead and doing great miracles; she has let Satan, under his leadership of religious man, take the Word of God and try to say that It was for another age. And she's believed it.\n\nL-117 When, the Bible said, \"The things that I do shall you do also.\" Jesus said that. \"Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.\" We're still creatures. \"These signs shall follow every one of them that believe.\" She denies every bit of It. [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-118 She denies all the supernatural, and she swapped It for his intellectual conception of the Bible; where priests, and holy fathers, so-called, where bishops, archbishops, where district presbyters, general overseers, and so forth, has put their own interpretation to It. And God has left them, set there, dead as twelve o'clock. The only things left in the last days is a bunch of little Pentecostals with a bunch of music whooped up as hard as they can, running up-and-down the floors, speaking in tongues and shouting, \"and having a form of godliness, but denying the Word thereof.\" Tell them to be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ; laugh in your face. But, that, God goes right on making it so just the same, proving His Word to be so. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-119 Notice, the tree that Satan caused Eve to partake of, was \"the tree of good and evil.\" It was a mixed tree. Now look at the day we're living in, when He's calling out a Bride. He's got a church that claims to be doing good, when it's evil, by denying the Word. A mixed tree. Oh, say, \"They--they have great societies. They--they--they--they help the this. And the Red Cross endorses it. And all the schools, they... Looky here!\" Oh, but just deny one Word, that's all you have to do to die; no matter how intellectual, how good it is. Jesus said, \"A little leaven leavens the whole lump.\" One spot of leaven ruins the lump. One Word of God, displaced, spoils the whole Picture. What about my arm being where my foot should be? See? What if my ear was down here where my hand should be? \"A little leaven leavens the whole lump.\" Say, \"How do you know It's right?\" God proves It right. He vindicates It. He said It here in the Word, then He proves It. That's how we know It's right or not. Just deny one Word is all it takes to die. It brought the same results in this evil age, spiritual death, as it did physical death to the whole human race. [I Corinthians 5:6]\n\nL-120 Notice how Satan got that scientific age back there, of Noah's, to lean upon their own understanding. Huh! The Bible tells us, in Proverbs, \"Lean not to our own understanding.\" And, \"Let every man's word be a lie, and God's be true.\" But Satan, by his knowledge, from beginning at the garden of Eden, got the people to lean upon their own 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min understanding. And, you know, through his great Max Factor's works that he had back there, he got women so fair that it caused the son of man's... the sons of God, rather, to fall to sin and marry them. Right. He... Women was so fair, so pretty. [Proverbs 3:5], [Romans 3:4]\n\nL-121 Now you take the ordinary woman on the street today. A lot of you has read the story; you never heard it, 'cause it before my days. Pearl O'Brien, how many ever heard of her? Sure. She was supposed to be the world's most beautiful woman. Why, there ain't a school kid that goes in the schoolhouse today but what's twice as pretty as she was. Why is it? The beauty of women is to happen in the last days. They've cut their hair. They put them in little girls dresses. They put shorts, and bikinis, and ever what you call, on them. They put paint, and rouge, and all these kind of things, to make them something that they're not. See? But through scientific knowledge they've been able to achieve this. Do you know there's more spent for cosmetics for women, than there is, in the United States, twice or three times as much, as spent for food to live on? Prove that, that's right, for cosmetics.\n\nL-122 Notice, \"The sons of God saw the daughters of men,\" not daughters of God, \"the daughters of men, that they were beautiful,\" and it caused the sons of God to fall into this delusion. \"And took them kind of women and married them,\" and it brought a age of prostitution, just like it is today; like it was in Sodom, like it's predicted to be today. That, when men and women of this day swap wives. If they don't like this wife, they--they go over to Reno, Nevada, and get married; and, or get a divorce, that one, and marry again in fifteen minutes. And women so pretty that they're almost irresistible. And what is it? The devil! See Satan still in beauty? Notice. [Genesis 6:2], [Luke 17:26-30]\n\nL-123 Notice, that sin was never forgiven them. That pretty, scientific age was the very evil age that God destroyed off of the face of the earth; that pretty, scientific age. Jesus said it'll be that again just before the coming of the Son of man. That right? Notice, Jesus said, \"As it was in days of Noah, so will it be in the coming of the Son of man,\" when they all tried to marry... Now watch, \"The sons of God married the pretty daughters of men,\" and God never did forgive them for it. [Luke 17:26], [Genesis 6:2]\n\nL-124 Just the same as Balaam's teaching, that he caused the pretty, intellectual, scientific women of Moab to... with their flirty eyes, her paints and powders, her fine perfumes, to entice the sons of God; against their own women that worked and had callouses in their hands, with no makeup on. Enticed them over, and, \"Let us marry one another, because we're all the same people.\" That was a lie! It was a--a lie, and an achievement of the devil, to get the sons of God to marry the--the daughters of men. It was the lie of the devil, for Balaam, that false prophet, to try to prophesy against Moses that tried to hold the race together; to say, \"Well, we believe the same God. We offer the same offerings. We have the same sacrifices. We do everything just alike.\" \"So close that it would deceive the Elected if possible.\" See? [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Come away from her, people! You have nothing to do with her! [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-125 Notice, it was not likely that God would interpret His Word to Cain's evil generation. No. God would not interpret His Word to them. Notice... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] God, the knowledge to make a world so pretty and scientific and sinful, He had to destroy it? Would God do that, make a world so pretty; look here, God making His daughters so pretty, and would dress them so sexy, that His sons would lust after them and would commit adultery? What? God do a thing like that? This naked, stripped off bunch of Laodiceans, worshiping the god of this world, through their ethics, and education, and shrewdness, and prettiness! \"Come out of her,\" the Bible said, \"be not partakers of her sins, and don't receive her plagues.\" God will rain hail out of the skies one day, as big as a hundred pounds apiece, and will destroy her by stoning her; like His Word always said He done, His laws. Well, if God did a thing like that, revealed His Word to such a people as that, He would be--be defeating His Own purpose. God is not foolish. He's the source of all wisdom. So you see where that stuff come from? It come from Satan, and it's still of Satan. And the church has believed it. [I Timothy 5:22] 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min\n\nL-126 Now you see, women, I'm trying my best to show you the Word of God. The Bible said, \"If a woman cuts her hair, she dishonors her head,\" which is her husband. And her husband is the head, with God, so she dishonors God and her husband. [I Corinthians 11:5]\n\nL-127 Now this shows who is the head of this world's church system. That shows who is the head of it. It's Satan, in the form of a super man, person of knowledge, a super knowledge. He knows more than all the rest of them. No matter what the Word says, he--he's got his own interpretation to It, see, the interpretation for this evil age.\n\nL-128 Notice his plans to build a super denominational church, the World Council of Churches, see, a super denominate, so that all the world will worship him, the beast, under the name of united Christianity. Would you like to read that in the Bible? Revelation 13:6 and 8. It's a modern tower of Babel. [Revelation 13:6, 8]\n\nL-129 Don't you remember how that Nimrod, that hypocrite, built this big tower and made all the other little cities pay tribute to it? Babble and Babel is the same thing. It just changes its names, and, as it comes on up. It's, Rome now is Babylon. And the whole world is brought to Babylon, and it's brought in by the World Council of Churches which will make every one of them bow to her. And you've took the mark of the beast, not knowing what you were doing. Because... But those who are elected will hear the Word and come out of it. [Genesis 10:8-10]\n\nL-130 How contrary is denomination to God's Word! He never had one, never dealt in one, and never dealt with one. I want some historian to show me where ever a prophet ever come out of the church. Show me where God ever blessed a church that was... after it was organized. She went on the shelf and died, with intellectual wisdom from the devil, by their leaders, and refused the Word of God as It growed up into the perfect stature of Christ. Now it's at the head. How contrary! Separate from that unbelieving Eve, you children of the evening Light!\n\nL-131 Satan, god of this age, by his knowledge, getting the people to eat from his mixed tree of good and evil. Notice, Satan, by his knowledge, causing the people of this evil age to eat from his tree of good and evil. He says that he is building a greater Christian civilization, by his knowledge of good and evil, a greater Christian civilization.\n\nL-132 But Christ's little Virgin, Word, Flock, Bride, don't care for his knowledge. She keeps, him, free of him. What is... Now let's talk about Her, a minute. She waits for Her Lord and His Millennium honeymoon, right, with the Word Groom, as She is the Word Bride.\n\nL-133 Knowledge and civilization, and true Christianity, has nothing in common. Civilization, and true Christianity, has not one thing in common. Civilization is by knowledge. We all know that. And knowledge is from Eden, proved it, by what he preached in Eden. And knowledge causes death. Is that right? What caused death in the garden of Eden? Knowledge. But can't be of God, so it's of the devil. Whew, was that a good one! Knowledge, science, education, is the greatest hindrance that God ever had. It is of the devil. Now I'll get some letters on that, I know. I'm waiting for them. [Genesis 2:17]\n\nL-134 Look what culture has got us into now. See? Look what it's done. Where we at? We've leaned to those things, through our own understanding by our science. You say, \"What about God, you think He is ignorance?\" Oh, no. God will set up His Own kind of civilization on earth, when He takes it over. This is Satan's world; he is god now of his worldly scientific knowledge. But God will set His Own kind of civilization up. It won't be a civilization like this. You just remember that. It won't be the kind of civilization we got today. No, no. It will be according to His Word and His purpose. For, the god of this present evil age will be destroyed, and his kingdom with him.\n\nL-135 This modern knowledge-loving age could have no better leader than the one they've got, Satan, a perverter of the Word of God, like he started off in the garden of Eden, but a religious person relying upon his own understanding. As I've said before, Proverbs 3:5, that, \"We're not to lean to our own understanding.\" They must have a god, for they are human. Yet, he makes them what they want. As being a human being, always, all 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min human beings... When we come here, we found the Indians even worshiping idols, and the sun, and everything. As a human being, they must have a god. So this great intellectual age must have a god, so it's become... The god of this world has become knowledge, denomination, science, \"having a form of godliness, but denying the Power thereof.\" [Proverbs 3:5], [II Timothy 3:5]\n\nL-136 Notice, their god makes them just what they want. They lust for the flesh, and that's what he gives them. \"They want to wear bikinis. Let them wear it. See? If they want to do this or that, let them do it. Ain't no harm in it; they go to church. Their mother was Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal, Presbyterian. Just let them alone.\" That's the god of this age; smart, wise, scientific. It needs no faith. It don't have to prove anything. It's already proven, by their knowledge. \"Well, we're the biggest church there is in town,\" their knowledge. \"Our pastor has got a D.D., Ph.D.\" See, don't need no faith; relies on knowledge. Let them live any way, as long as they come to worship him by their denomination and creed. There's a big black eye there, but look at it. Laughs at God's Word, saying things contrary to the Word; and tries, by their knowledge, to prove scientifically that the Word isn't true. Oh, what a age we're living in! See the god of this age?\n\nL-137 Notice, but God is waiting till the iniquity of these modern Amorites is filled. Don't worry, He'll have His Moses ready at that time. There will be an exodus, someday, to the promised land. There will be a Moses come along, who will call out, \"restore the Faith of the children back to the fathers.\" It'll come, one of these days. Did... You say, \"Well, look how we're progressing.\" Sure, the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. It'll come, one of these days. Let them destroy themselves. [Genesis 15:16]\n\nL-138 Civilization, knowledge, perverts God's Word to suit their own taste. Every denomination does the same thing. Satan then preaches his own gospel of knowledge in his own church.\n\nL-139 There is only two classes of people spoke of in the New Testament. \"The children of God, and the children of the devil.\" Did you know that? You want to put a Scripture down for it? First John 3:10, if you want the Scripture. I'm reading it right here, got it wrote out. All right. All right. [I John 3:10]\n\nL-140 In Ephesians 2:2, they are called, \"The children of disobedience.\" Like Eve was, disobedient to God's Word. The children of obedience, and disobedience, have nothing in common. Then how can the Bride of Christ associate in a denomination, when one is disobedient and the other obedient? How can one, be the Word; and the other one, perverted word? How can a prostitute and a clean woman walk together in agreement? They can't do it. They have no fellowship at all. \"Come out from amongst them!\" It's of the devil. It's the mark of the beast. Heading right into it now; all denominations. I don't care whose it is. God is taking, not a denomination, \"a people for His Name.\" A denomination won't receive these Truths. It'll take an individual person that can see God, look at His Word and believe It, and belong to no organization; but live for God, not for his organization, the intellectual wisdom of some bishop or something has taught it. That's right. [Ephesians 2:2]\n\nL-141 The children of disobedience, and the children of obedience, has nothing in common. One of the... is of the day of Light; the other one, of night and darkness, evil age, this evil age of darkness, nightclubs, dances, yet belong to church. It's okay with their god. They don't have any condemnation about it; nothing bothers them. \"Why, it don't condemn me to cut my hair,\" a woman said. \"Don't hurt my conscience.\" She's got no more conscience than a snake has got hips. That's right. Certainly not. She don't know what a conscience is. It had been seared so hard till she don't even know what it is. That's right. [Ephesians 5:6-7]\n\nL-142 Walking around, over the Word of God, saying, \"Why, that's some old fogy. Don't go up there; they're just a bunch of noise and carry-on, anyhow.\" Huh! Know no more about God than a Hottentot would know about an Egyptian night. That's right. It's true. \"Having a form of godliness, but denying the Power thereof; from such turn away. For this is the sort that go from house to house, and lead silly women.\" \"Oh, dear, you're, you should do this. Oh, dear, I think your old fogy preacher down there, if you just... Oh, you would look cute in a 'kini,\" or ever what you call the thing. \"You, if you'd do all this, that, and the other. Why, a little cigarette 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min won't hurt nobody. I belong to church, and you know our denomination is looked up to as well as anybody's.\" Don't you believe that old painted-up liar. She is lying to you. That's right. Yes, sir. [II Timothy 3:1-6]\n\nL-143 It's okay with their god. Oh, he thinks that's wonderful, and they just love him for it. My, they'll argue with you. They'll stand right up and fuss at you about it. Why, sure, Satan stood right in the face of Jesus Christ, the Word, and tried to say, \"It's written.\" And there He was, the vindicated Word of God. He said, \"Get behind Me, Satan!\" Just walk and do the same thing. Like a fellow said to me one time, said, \"Now, if you believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost is right, and you believe you've got It,\" said, \"now you strike me blind.\" That was a preacher. Said, \"You strike me blind!\" He said, \"Paul struck a--a man blind one day.\" [Matthew 4:1-6]\n\nL-144 I said, \"Mister, how can I strike you blind when you're already blind? How can I kill you when you're already dead?\" Uh-huh. He said, \"Me, my eyes is twenty-twenty!\" I said, \"Your physical part; but you're still blind.\" \"It's impossible! The Bible don't interpret things. We speak where the Bible speaks, and silent where It's silent.\"\n\nL-145 I said, \"All right, when Elijah was down at--at Dothan, see, there come up the whole Syrian army around. And the servant run up, said, 'Oh, my father!' Said, 'My father,' said, 'the Syrians is surrounded us.' \"Elijah rubbed his eyes, woke up and said, 'There's more with us than there is with them.' \"He said, 'I don't see nobody.' \"Said, 'God, open his eyes.' Now, he was blind. And he looked around at that old prophet, and upon the mountains; was full of Angels, and chariots of Fire, and horses of Fire. \"And he walked out there, and the Bible said, 'He smote them blind.' Blind to what? To him. He walked out, said, 'Are you looking for Elijah?' \"'Yes, we're looking for him.' \"Said, 'Come on, I'll show you where he's at.' Elijah leading them to Elijah. Blind!\" I said, \"You know what I'm going to say to you? Just exactly what my Lord said to your father, 'get behind me.'\" Uh-huh. Uh-huh. [II Kings 6:16-19]\n\nL-146 Notice, the children of obedience, and disobedience, has nothing in common. The disobedience worship their god. \"Oh,\" they say, \"we believe the Bible.\" Yes, it's a mixed tree. See, they add the world and knowledge to It. Satan's tree, mixed; see, she took from Satan's tree, good and evil. \"Oh, we believe the Word.\" Sure, but not all of It. Eve believed the Word, too, but let--let Satan take his tree and pervert It a little bit. That's what it is. \"Whosoever shall add one word, or take one Word from It.\" He is still the same yesterday, today, and forever! Notice. All right. [Revelation 22:18-19]\n\nL-147 This evil age is of darkness, yet belongs to church. Their god, they love him for it, the way he lets them do. They have no condemnation. Nothing bothers them as long as they belong to church. Balaam taught the church the same thing. \"Let us unite; we're all the same.\" It was the last trick. God never forgave them for believing such a lie. [Jude 1:10-12]\n\nL-148 Remember, it was a unpardonable sin, three times in the Bible, for any persons to add one word of their own interpretation to God's Word after It had been vindicated the Truth. In the garden of Eden, right, in the garden of Eden, one word added caused death. When Balaam added the word, that, \"We're all the same,\" they, God never did forgive Israel that. Every one of them perished in the wilderness, except the three that God brought out. Jesus said, \"They're, every one, dead,\" that's Eternally separated. They're all gone; never was forgiven. It's a unpardonable sin; never forgiven them. Oh, my! Flee it, children of the evening Lights! [Genesis 3:3]\n\nL-149 See now who is the leader of this modern, religious, evil age? It's the devil, taking that tree of good and evil, and placing it out there, notice, bringing his beautiful church bride to the ecumenical council for a wedding. That's a good 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min one. His beautiful scientific church, with all the--the--the degrees that can be gotten; the Ph.D's out of the church of Christ, the Ph.D's out of the Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostals, and all. Bringing them all, with their decorated fineries and big churches, all to the ecumenical council, \"We are one.\" It'll never be forgiven them. A denomination, to wear the brand of a denomination, is the mark of the beast. We've done been through it on here; to do it. Flee it, children, flee it! See? Great, beautiful church to the ecumenical wedding, wearing his mark! Shorts, sure, worldly dress, sexy, paint, really good disciples of the devil, to catch the sons of God; marry a good full-born boy off into some old reprobate like that. That's right. What a...\n\nL-150 You said, \"Cutting hair, what's that got to do?\" Brother, let's stop here just a minute. I just feel somebody resented that. Might have been out on the wire somewhere. Listen. A hair to a woman is a Nazarite vow. Hair to Samson was a Nazarite vow. And when a woman cuts off her hair, she--she absolutely denies her Nazarite vow that she is a Bride to Christ. Because, there, that one thing, she spoils the whole Picture. Correctly! A Nazarite is \"one that is consecrated for a purpose.\" Is that right? Samson was consecrated to a age and to a purpose, therefore he had long hair. The woman that's a child of God, lets her hair grow, to show that's she's consecrated to every Word of God. [Numbers 6:2-5], [Judges 13:3-7]\n\nL-151 If she cuts it off, I don't care how much she dances, sings, is in the choir, speaks in tongues, runs up-and-down, or has all kind of aid societies, she is dead. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD, the Word of God. First Corinthians 14. Yeah. She has denied her Nazarite vow and sold out to the god of this modern age. She does it. Now, shame on you, lady, or woman! [I Corinthians 11:5-6, 10-13]\n\nL-152 Really catchers of God's sons, like it was. As Jesus said, \"As it was in the days of Noah, the women fair, and the sons of God begin to marry among them, so will it be when the Son of man returns.\" And their god thinks it's great, and pretty, and scientific, knowledge; Hollywood fashion, styled in his own shop, sure, all this here gooey and stuff, you know. [Genesis 6:2]\n\nL-153 And she, his church, simply loves it! Oh, my! \"I'll give you to understand, I am Methodist. I am Presbyterian. Our pastor has got better sense than to say a thing like that.\" He's got not enough sense to say the things that God says then. See?\n\nL-154 She, the church, simply worships it. She loves it. Just what she's wanted! She won't join up with nothing, brother, or come into nothing she has to act like something different from what these modern Jezebels are, 'cause that's the nature that's in her. How can you be any nature... \"Who taking thought can add one cubit to his stature?\" If you were born to be five-foot tall, you'll not be six foot. Oh, yeah, like Booth-Clibborn's \"stretching machine.\" [Matthew 6:27], [Luke 12:25]\n\nL-155 Then listen, man, you bunch of rickies! If you were born to be a man, then act like a man. These bangs hanging down in your face, and curled up like some sex appeal, why, you perverted generation of snakes! What's the matter with you, anyhow? My God will judge this nation someday with fire. He'll sink it beneath the ocean. The hour of His judgment is at hand. The whole world will go.\n\nL-156 Religious perversion! Human perversion; men don't even know what sex they belong to, neither does women. Stand up with a pair of man's overalls on, or a pair of little old shorts, clothes that's... her every move and form of her body, and call herself a Christian. She's not even a lady, let alone a Christian. She's a street prostitute used by Satan, inspired by Satan, to send the sons of God to hell, to fulfill the Word that Jesus Christ said would take place. I didn't mean to say that, but He said it, anyhow. See where this religious spirit comes from? The mixed tree. [Deuteronomy 22:5]\n\nL-157 Say, \"What's wrong with them slacks,\" or whatever they call it, \"pedal-pushers?\" or ever what it is. The Bible said, that, \"Any woman that'll wear a garment that pertains to a man, it's an abomination in the sight of God.\" That's THUS SAITH THE BIBLE. And a woman that'll cut her hair, dishonors her head. And it's not even... It's a sinful thing for a woman to offer prayer with short hair, the Bible said so, pray in public with her head uncovered. And her... 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min Oh, you say, \"I wear a hat.\" [Deuteronomy 22:5], [I Corinthians 11:5, 13]\n\nL-158 You hypocrite, teach them women such things as that! When, the Bible said, \"Her hair is given her for a covering,\" not some man-made hat. That's what the Bible said. I'm not responsible; I'm only responsible to tell the Truth. Don't be dishonest, as the Bible said, \"Handling the Word of God with deceit,\" to--to fix or--or meet the request of a bunch of rickettas. [I Corinthians 11:15]\n\nL-159 I got the word evil here. I got \"Elvis\" wrote down instead of evil. It's all about the same. The word Elvis means a \"cat,\" and the word Ricky means a \"rat.\" When you say \"little Ricky,\" you mean, \"little rat.\" What you call him, that's what he is. Your kid is named that, change it quickly, for the sake of the Gospel. Don't name a kid... You never heard such names as that back in the Bible, or in any other age. It's the age, name for this age. There ever was perverted rats and cats, it's there.\n\nL-160 All this...?... million-dollar disc jockies, and these kids walking out here, can't even go to--to school without a thing sticking in the ear, and a little old transistor radio in their pocket, just, \"boom-de-boom.\" Oh, they come up there at the house, and we made... Them guys trying to paint my house up there. We said, \"Get that thing out of here. If you can't work without that, then get off the job. Makes me so nervous I can't even stand around here. We've dedicated this place to God. We don't want that kind of boogie-woogie nonsense of this last days around here.\" I said, \"Shut it up or get off the job!\"\n\nL-161 Notice, religious, though, oh, sure, go right to church and stand in the vestibule, with listening to boogie-woogie.\n\nL-162 Also, notice, Christ's Word-Bride is heading up, also. As we see where the antichrist is heading, begin back there and now coming to a head; a ecumenical council will put it to an ecclesiastical head. And the little Church that's come along, also, Christ's Word-Bride down through the age, is coming to a Head, 'cause She's going to be united back to Its Mate. Always, just like the church and everything else, It's got to unite. The Wheat, everything else, comes right back to its head where it started from; like Cain and Abel. Word-Bride heading up in the Person of the Word of God made manifest in this evil age that we're living. See where it's heading up?\n\nL-163 And Satan will soon take his intellectual bride and exalt this great one, which is the antichrist, the hierarchy's, and set him upon a throne, \"and the whole world will wonder after him.\" And then Christ will come. And two cannot exist in the same time. And his kingdom will be taken; he'll be destroyed. And Christ, the Word of God... Which, the woman is a part of the man's body. They're not two; they're one. And the Bride, Church, Word, \"a people called out from here and there, for His Name's sake,\" will unite in the Body of Jesus Christ. And the kingdom of the antichrist will be taken and destroyed. And Christ shall take throne, and set upon the throne of His father David, and reign upon the earth for a thousand years; then present the Church to God, \"without spot or blemish.\" Yes!\n\nL-164 Now notice her long hair, Nazarite vow to the Word. I'll picture the Bride of Christ now. We picture the antichrist, where she is, religious and everything, science. Now the humble little Bride of Christ just simply believes the Word, whoever She is. It's individuals. I hope and trust that there's many setting present, many listening in. And I hope that myself, and every one of you all, are part of that Bride. I hope many. And, it will, all that's been ordained to that will be that, 'cause it's their nature. They see. The Word can only recognize the Word. It can't recognize a denomination or a perversion. It knows better; It's the Word. See? It can't recognize nothing... A wheat can't be nothing but a wheat. It started, a wheat; it'll head up, a wheat. And a weed can never be a wheat, yet it's watered by the same anointing. See? But it ain't a wheat. As I said the other day, about the tree with the different branches in it. [Numbers 6:2-5]\n\nL-165 Her long hair, Nazarite vow, shows that She is vowed to God. Her beautiful gown of His promised Word for the age that She is living in, wrapped around Her, vindicating Her with Himself, of Hebrew 13:8, \"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" As, She is a part of the Word Groom, true to Him in every point. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-166 Now look. If a woman goes out here and is married to a man, and she goes out and makes love with another man 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min and has an affairs with him, and come back to her husband, he should kick her out. Is that right? She must be true to him, 'cause she is vowed to him. And the Bride of Christ is vowed to Christ; and He is the Word. Not even wink at the other side, a woman should not even wink at another man. She should make no signs, no emotions at all towards him, for she is absolutely a bride to one bridegroom.\n\nL-167 We don't want none of your mixed trees, your denominations. Be true to Christ, the Word. He'll vindicate It to be true. No, sir, not even any emotion of anything towards making love to him, not join his ranks or anything else, or let him get you in his arms or in his care, or--or talk to you over this way, that way. You listen only to one Voice. \"My sheep know My Voice. A stranger they'll not...\" What is His Voice? Any man's voice is his word. And this is It, the Bible, not one word to be added to It or taken from It. Just stay right with that Voice. \"A stranger they won't follow,\" a denomination. [John 10:3-5], [Revelation 22:18-19]\n\nL-168 As, She is part of the Groom, true to Him in every point, waiting the Wedding. Uniting, not at the ecumenical council; but in the sky, at the Wedding Supper. She has been given... This is for our own church. The... She has been given, and revealed to Her, the Seven-Seal mysteries of the Bible. See? She sees the folly of the deceiver, so very close to the Truth, that almost deceive the Elected. She sees it. She... [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-169 See the two opposing spirits at work in this evil age? Can you see it? Each very religious, Cain and Abel, spirits again coming to their heads, still same as they started. One, worshiping by beauty, and by knowledge, and by education, and by science, and by ethics. And the other One, by faith of the revelation of the Word of God. Both of them is standing right in this building this morning. That's right. [Genesis 4:1-16]\n\nL-170 Revelation, or faith, in His Word, makes no claims of knowledge; the real, true Christian. They say, \"Have you got a--you got a doctor's degree?\" Makes no claims. \"I--I believe His Word.\" See? Doesn't make any claims. Doesn't claim to be educated. Doesn't belong to any denomination, any party, any sect. It belongs to Christ. It's His Wife; not a church wife. She's a prostitute. The Bible said she was a \"whore,\" and, \"THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS,\" and they all come together and make the same whore. And that kind of a woman is a woman that's untrue to her Husband; and claiming Christ as her husband, and belonging to a denomination. Such nonsense! We belong to Christ. [Revelation 17:5]\n\nL-171 But, in obedience, this little faith Woman, that lives by faith, the Bride; the person here, there; here, off somewhere else, some other church, some other denomination, whatever it is, in some not... Believes the Word of God, obedient, waiting in love, for the promise of the age to be confirmed. She is watching for it. She is part of that Word, and She is watching for Her life to manifest that Word. Brethren, can't you see that? I hope that didn't go over you. [Romans 8:23-26]\n\nL-172 The Body is waiting for (which is the Word), waiting for the Life (which is the Spirit) to confirm or make It alive. That's what She is waiting for. No other life will work in Her. She can't come to life any other way. Yet, She feels it out there, and She knows it's going to happen; then here it happens, then She wakes up. God said, \"Let there be,\" and She came forth like the first one come forth. [Romans 8:23-26]\n\nL-173 \"Children of disobedient\" means obedience... Disobedience means \"rebellion.\" I looked that up in the dictionary, to be sure. Rebellion, rebelling against (what?) the revealed Word of God. Like Cain revealed... rebelled against Abel's revealed revelation, vindicated of God that it was righteous. And Cain rebelled against it, and slew his brother. , [Ephesians 2:1-2] The Pharisees, with their own denominational knowledge of what the Word of God was, selected hand-picked man, rebelled against the vindicated Word of God made manifest for the day, Jesus Christ, and killed Him. That right? That's what \"the children of disobedience\" is, a rebellion against the Word of God. [Ephesians 5:6]\n\nL-174 Now see where they are? \"Oh, days of miracles is past. Jesus Christ is not the same yet. There is no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost. All that stuff is nonsense!\" See, rebellion! They don't have to say two things; just have to say one, that's all. That's rebellion, right there. They can't say you don't have eyes, you don't have ears; you got 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min to take the whole body, the whole Word. See? The Holy Spirit call, \"Comes out of her, be not partakers of her denominational dogma,\" as he laughs and scorns at the Word of God of this day. \"For God is not mocked,\" just remember. She'll get it. Don't be worry. She'll get it. The Bible, in Ephesians 4:30, if you want to put that down, Ephesians 4:30, said. \"God is not mocked. Whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap.\" They can't mock and make fun, and say these things, and get by with it. \"Like bread upon the water, it'll return.\" [Galatians 6:7], [Ephesians 4:30]\n\nL-175 She is the devil's bride, wrapped in his religious, sin-loving knowledge for this present evil age, to deceive you. Oh, my! A whole clique or denomination of seducing spirits, by scientific knowledge and a modern civilization! Claiming... We're going to close just in a few minutes. I'm going to have to stop, 'cause I can't get through it all, see. Claiming that she is building a great world for you to live in. She claims, that, in her civilization, she has built fine churches, colleges, schools, hospitals, libraries, and temporary help for man, without God's Word. She's done it. She's proved that she could do it. And the people has fell for it; yes, sir; schools, denominations, culture, better-dressed people, better-fed people. I'd rather be in a bread line, and be right with God; than to have fried chicken three times a day, and have to belong to a prostitute like that. [II Timothy 3:1-9]\n\nL-176 Remember, the hour is close at hands when the mark will come. You'll either be in it or out of it. It'll come like a thief in the night. It'll catch you right in there, and you're there. There ain't no getting out of it then; you done took it. Come out! An angel came down from Heaven, with a great shining face, and cried out to the people. It shook the earth. \"Come out of Babylon, for she is fallen. Be not partakers of her plagues, My people!\" Get out of her. Get out! Didn't we just read it in the Word, a while ago? An angel is a \"messenger,\" see, coming down. Notice the Holy Spirit, \"Come out of her, that you be not partakers.\" [Ephesians 5:7], [Revelation 18:4]\n\nL-177 Now she's built all these things. She has built great churches. She has built college, schools, taking the people and educating them into a--a better, so-called, civilization. And they've educated them by a modern civilization that's brought them into the pit of death, by knowledge, away from God and His Word.\n\nL-178 Don't you see the whole scheme? Do you see that, church? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Out on the air, if you see it in your own congregations out there, say \"amen,\" the rest of them will know where you're standing. See? She's did it. She's... It's a god of this earth, and she has built colleges. She has built universities. She has built hospitals. She has built libraries. She has built all these things for temporary help of man, just enough to deceive them, to get off of that Word. And what's she led them to? The whole church world is plunged into death, for God said that He would burn the whore, and her children, with an everlasting fire. Come out of it, people! Don't you be caught in there. You get away from that thing as quick as you can! By her scientific knowledge, she is been able to do this, now notice, without God's Word. [Revelation 19:2-3]\n\nL-179 God never did ordain us to go out and have schools. He never. He never told us to build hospitals. They're good. He never told us to build libraries. No, sir. He never. He said, \"Preach the Gospel.\" And, the Gospel, is manifesting, demonstrating the power of the Holy Spirit. [Mark 16:15]\n\nL-180 Paul said, \"The Gospel come to us, not through word only, but through the manifestation and demonstrations of the Holy Spirit.\" Paul said, \"I never come to you with great words of wisdom by some doctor of so forth, but I come to you in power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit; that your faith would not be in the wisdom or knowledge of the men of this world, but in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ; because He lives, the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" God help us to believe the same thing, and God vindicate the same thing as He has been doing. [Mark 16:15], [I Corinthians 2:4-5], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-181 He keeps you from seeing the true revelation and faith of God's Word being revealed and vindicated today, by his schools, libraries, literature, hospitals, and so forth. See? He keeps you from it. He is now interpreting, as he did to 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min Pharaoh, trying to keep you from seeing the meaning of the vindicated Word of His promised age in the evening Light, vindicated and proved. He has tried, by his knowledge, and schools, and better educated people, and ethics, and so forth, to keep you away from seeing That. Anything, so that you won't look at That and see that's Jesus Christ! How you know it's Jesus Christ? He is the Word, and He's the Word of this age. And this age, said that this would take place in this age, and here it is happening. See? See? He trying his best to keep you from seeing That. He'll tack any dirty name onto It he can. See? He'll call It \"holy-rollers\" and everything else. He called Jesus \"Beelzebub.\" \"And they call the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more they going to call the disciples?\" See? [John 1:1], [John 1:14], [Matthew 10:25]\n\nL-182 See, trying to keep you from seeing the real meaning of the Word. Not what... See, he is interpreting It, saying It means this. God said, \"I promised in the last days I'd send you Malachi 4.\" It don't have to be interpreted; He did it. He said, \"And as it was in the days of Lot, the world will be in a Sodom condition; and in that time, I will reveal the Son of man by it, exactly.\" We got all kinds of impersonations and everything else, of it, but we got the real One, too. See? He said He would do it. He said the antichrist would raise up and almost deceive the Elected if it was possible. But said, \"Let them alone. Let them go ahead. Their folly will be found out.\" Why? The Word test proves it. See? When it come to that Word, \"That had been back this way, that? Oh, I don't believe in serpent's seed. I don't believe in this, that, and the other.\" It's never been revealed, see, no, never. Oh, brother, just look where... We're going to have to close, because it's twelve o'clock. [Luke 17:29-30], [Matthew 24:24], [II Timothy 3:9]\n\nL-183 Notice, trying to keep you from seeing the meaning of the Word of this age, of evening Light being interpreted. It is... What does it mean? It's the time of exodus is at hand, God is coming for Her, as sure as the world. See?\n\nL-184 Now I want to ask you a question. While, it is twelve o'clock now, five minutes after; and we'll go on, tonight. Do you see the god of this age? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Do you believe it? [\"Amen.\"] See how it is, a church, intellectual, science? The whole world belongs to it, see, the denominations. And, you say, \"I'm a Christian.\" \"What denomination do you belong to?\" Well, if I belonged to a denomination, I don't believe I'd be a Christian. Now, that's a big word, but that's right. I just got through saying that knowledge and science, and Christianity, has no fellowship at all. One is of the devil, and the other one is of God. Anything that denies God's Word, keep away from it. See? No, sir. The Bible calls, for this last days, for Christians to come out of that prostitute, that's tree of good and evil.\n\nL-185 Sure, she has good. Can anybody speak evil of a hospital? No, sir. Library? No, sir. Education? No, sir. But, see, they're giving them that without the Word. See how deceiving it is? Giving them a church to go to, a worship to worship, \"a god setting upon a throne.\" The Bible foretold it.\n\nL-186 Now you belong to one of those bodies. There is only two of them in the earth now, always has been, and will be till Jesus comes, and one of them will be destroyed. Now you belong to one of the bodies. One of them, you've joined; the other one, you are born in It. See? One of them, you're a part of because you are born into It. You have to be a part of It. Could I deny I got an arm? No more than I can deny any Word of God, if I'm part of God. I'm part of William Branham; I'm in parts, and every part is a part of me. And every Word of God has to fit my spirit, has to fit my soul, has to fit my living, It has to fit my ideas. If my ideas is contrary to That, then God's Spirit don't dwell in me. That's right. Can't deny one Word of It.\n\nL-187 You belong to one of the bodies. Got to be, it's just got to be. It's either the Body of God, which is by the Word; or the body of Satan, by the church. And the whole world will have to belong to some church; it worships some god. You've got to worship either the god of knowledge, you rely upon what you hear by knowledge, you rely upon this, or that, or the other; or you rely upon God's Word, by faith, watching for Him to vindicate It and make It true. The real Church of God is watching for the coming of that glad Millennium day, 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min When our blessed Lord shall come and catch His waiting Bride away; Oh, my heart is filled with rapture as I labor, watch and pray, For our Lord is coming back to earth again. Oh, our Lord is coming back to earth again, Satan will be bound a thousand years, we'll have no tempter then, After Jesus shall come back to earth again.\n\nL-188 Oh, peoples of this United States, where this Message is going now, flee as hard as you can from this knowledge, scientific age that we're living in. Flee to the Word of God! You, I, no one can--can knows It. No one can prove It. God does His Own proving. No one has a right to interpret It; me, no other man has a right. God does His Own interpreting. He made the promise. He said He would do this in the last days. And in the last days the god of this evil age would blind the eyes of the people, with his intellectual knowledge, on a mixed tree of good and evil, still giving it to the people. And here comes, that thing heading up, that denomination from way back in the Dark Ages, and before the Dark Ages, all heading up in a super man, Satan, who said, \"I will exalt myself above the sons of God, and they will listen to me.\" \"And he as God will sit in the temple of God, and the sons of God will fall for it.\" [Isaiah 14:13-14]\n\nL-189 Why, the son of God, say, \"Well, my wife, it ain't; she's a good...\" Go ahead, just go on. See? You say, \"Well, He said 'sons of God.'\" Yes, sir. Man, whoever he is, was made in the image of God, for the glory of God. And a woman is a by-product for man, not of God. Right. \"When the sons of God saw the daughters of men were fair, they took unto them women.\" \"And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man.\" Now look, if you want to know what stage the church is, watch what stage the women is, see, 'cause she is the church. Watch what she is doing, see, and in this evil prostitute age. [Genesis 1:26], [Genesis 2:22], [Genesis 6:2]\n\nL-190 Look, there wasn't a meaner, wickeder, lower, prostituting city in the world, than Nazareth, and out of there God chose a virgin. \"Could any good thing come out of Nazareth?\" And out of this evil age, where the god of this age has blinded the eyes of the people, with their dogmas and denominations; out of that very age, God is choosing a people for His Name. Though here neglected and despised, one day the Lord will bring His chosen ones within the gate, and that's worth everything. Then we'll sing and shout, and dance about, The Lamb will dry our tears; We'll have one glad homecoming week, The first ten thousand years. (That's right.) A wondrous people for His Name and they are called His Bride. (Is that right?) Though neglected and despised, one day the Lord will bring Those chosen ones within the gate, (in the exodus) and that's worth everything to me. [John 1:46]\n\nL-191 I'm getting to be an old man. And my days begin to fade out; and my eyesight begins to get dim; and my little flame of life begins to burn low. I don't fear the darkness. For I want to say this, with Paul, \"I know Him in the power of His resurrection.\" No matter where they bury me, if I drown in the sea, or burn in a furnace, or eat up by a lion, He'll call my name, and I'll speak. Amen! Let us pray. [Philippians 3:10]\n\nL-192 If there be in here, or out on the wires of this Message across the nation, in your little churches and groups and halls, and wherever you're seated, if there is one, oh, let me persuade you; let me beg you, as a minister of the Gospel; let me beg you, in the Name of Jesus Christ; flee the wrath of this wicked age! Don't serve the god of this evil age. Oh, I know you say, \"It's good. They're fine.\" Exactly, a mixed tree. You can't mix knowledge with God's Word. It's a Word that's to be believed by faith, not knowledge. You don't understand It; you accept It. You say It's right, and 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min then you live by It. That's all He asks you to do. If there's any present here in our group, we can't make the altar call to bring you up here, because there's not no room; or out over the air, over the telephone lines, if there is any out there that doesn't know Him. Don't... [Luke 3:7]\n\nL-193 Oh, women, I've scolded you this morning, not me, I've only quoted the Word. Short hair, wearing them little old clothes, dressing yourself real sexy-looking, don't you realize that the spirit that... You may be clean, sister, dear, when it comes to your body, but in your soul don't you see what's got a hold of you? Would God make His daughter look sexy to deceive His own son, to lust after her, to make them both be answer for adultery? Would He do it, sister? Ask yourself that question. No, not by ten million miles. Don't lay that onto God. [I Corinthians 11:2-15], [I Timothy 2:9-15]\n\nL-194 Brother, has god give you a spirit of this world till you can't see that that's wrong? Has he blinded your eyes, to the ethics of the church, the denomination, the creed, and so forth, that you can't see that God is vindicating His Word and making It so? Has your job, has your boss, has your wife, has your children, has your church, or anything, separated you from the Word of God, which is the only source of Life? Flee it, my brother! I love you, with godly love. I don't respect any of my brothers above you, not at all. If I did, I'd show respect of person. I don't say these things to make you angry. I show, say these things because they're in the Word of God. And as a servant of God, and the love of God in my heart, I tell you those things so you will see and understand. Maybe you wouldn't know if I didn't tell you. Will you flee it today? Now, with everywhere across the land, let's bow our heads. [Revelation 3:15-21]\n\nL-195 Dear God, laying before me is handkerchiefs. People are sick; I'm laying my hands upon them, that You'll heal them. [Mark 16:18]\n\nL-196 And I trust, Lord, tonight, that there'll be a great service, that the Power of God will be here, great signs and wonders. As we heard the results from these last couple meetings, how tremendous, see what happened! I pray, dear God, that You will give us a double portion tonight. I pray it with a sincere heart, Lord, because it's my love for You and Your Word, and for these people. Grant it, dear God.\n\nL-197 And if out across the land, or even in here now, that there's some that's sick and afflicted, and has to be gone for tonight, won't be here, or be out there in the churches or places where they're met; I pray You heal them. Now, Lord, but for the greatest of all healing! If You heal their physical body from cancer, TB, pneumonia, something, they'll get sick again, no doubt, if they live very long, for their body is still under sin, the curse. But let them get the--the real Divine healing, the healing of the soul, which makes a new creature, passes from death unto Life, and then waiting in this old tabernacle for the redemption of the body after the soul has been redeemed. Grant it, Lord. [II Corinthians 5:17]\n\nL-198 May they flee them denominations and creeds. God, way out there in them creeds and denominations I've met some of the finest brothers. And, God, how can I say it that they'll see, and let them see the Word? It bothers me. But I know, again, that You said, \"No man can come,\" no matter how good, how meek, how gentle, \"unless My Father has called him. And all My Father has given Me, they will come.\" And, Lord, I feel my solely responsibility for telling the Truth. And not as Paul said, \"Handle the Word of God with deceit,\" with denominational dogma mixed into It, as a tree of mixture of good and knowledge, good and evil; but with a open heart and the Holy Spirit. Grant it, God. Save every one. [John 6:37], [John 17:24]\n\nL-199 Now with our heads bowed and our eyes closed. And not to me... I can't say it this way, \"It makes me no difference whether you do or not.\" It does make me a difference. I love you. And I hope you don't think 'cause I have to speak harsh... As Paul said, \"I'd like to be present with you, and I'd change my attitude.\" It wasn't because he didn't like them; he loved them. Not... As Jesus had to rebuke them, and then die for them. See, \"Father, forgive them; they don't even know what they're doing.\" To think, a human being that wants to be right, and trying to be right, and to see that devil... That's the one I'm against, that's blinded the eyes of these people. [Galatians 4:20], [Luke 23:34]\n\nL-200 This nation should be burning with the glory of God, to see what's took place in her in this last day, this last. Why 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min ain't these revivals hit the old countries? This is the West Coast over here, furtherest west you can go. Now the sin barrier has thundered down beneath the earth, and she is sinking; places, and Los Angeles and Hollywood, sinking so many inches per hour, no way to stop it. Yeah, we're here. Most any time we'll hear the summons. If you know that... Now, don't nobody look. But if you know, from your heart... I'm asking you. I can't know your heart, 'less God reveals it. But from your heart, if you can see that you're not where you should be with God and His Word, in faith, would you just to Him raise your hand, say to Him, \"Lord, help Thou me.\" O God! Out of this church, packed, packed around the walls, inside and out, literally hundreds of hands, maybe two hundred hands raised up. Thank you for your honesty.\n\nL-201 Dear Jesus, don't let one of them be lost. As Your servant, that stands between the living and the dead, pointing them, with a finger, to the Word of God. I cannot save them, Lord, but they want to be saved. And, Father, as I have said many times, the sun rises in the morning; and as it comes up across the earth, it's sent by God to ripen the grain, to make natural food for natural living. But, O God, You said, \"To them that fear His Name shall the Sun of righteousness rise with healing in His wings.\" Let the Sun of righteousness, the Word of God, rise in the hearts of the people, and the healing rays of faith in that Word cure every disobedient to the Word, and bring them till the fullness of the sons and daughters of God. They are Yours, Lord. In the Name of Jesus Christ, both here and out over the air, I present them that raised their hands to You for the salvation of their souls. Amen. There my raptured soul shall find (Where? At this altar.) Rest beyond... (by faith I look over there where I'm going) Near the cross, (that's where the Word hangs)... the cross, Be my glory ever; Till my raptured soul shall find Rest beyond the river. Jesus, keep me... (That's, crucified with Him, don't want nothing of the world. \"Keep me crucified.\") There's a precious fountain, It's free to all, a healing stream, Flows from Calvary's mountain. In the cross, in the cross, Be my glory (let's raise our hands) ever; Till my raptured soul shall find Rest beyond the river. [Malachi 4:2]\n\nL-202 [Brother Branham speaks now to the musicians--Ed.] \"I can hear my Saviour calling.\" Reach over and get a hold of somebody's hand, and say, \"God bless you, Christian.\" [Brother Branham speaks again to the musicians--Ed.] \"I can hear my Saviour calling.\" You feel His Presence? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Out there over the waves of the phones, you all shake one another's hands out there, and say, \"God bless you, Christian.\"\n\nL-203 You know, there's a pool of water back here. He's taking a people that's wearing His Name. You haven't been baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, there's a pool, there is robes, there is man standing ready. You are welcome, if you truly accept Jesus as your Saviour and believe that that is the Truth. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-204 Remember, there was never a person in the Bible, or any time before the organizing of the Catholic church, was ever baptized any other way than in the Name of Jesus Christ. There is no place found in Scripture, or history, that any persons was ever baptized, in to the Church of the living God, in the name of the titles of \"Father, Son, Holy Ghost.\" It is a Catholic dogma, and not a Bible teaching.\n\nL-205 Being interviewed by a priest, I asked him that. He said, \"That is the truth. But we are the church; we can change whatever we want to. The solemnity is in the church. God is in His church.\"\n\nL-206 I said, \"God is in His Word. And if the church is...\" I said, \"God is the Word. And if the church is contrary to the 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min Word, then I don't believe the church.\" I let every man's word be a lie, whether it be priest, pope, whatever he might be, and God's Word be true. And Paul caused every man, no matter how he had been baptized, if he wasn't baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, to come and be baptized over again. [Romans 3:4]\n\nL-207 And after some had already received the Holy Ghost, Peter said, \"Can we forbid water, seeing that these have received the Holy Ghost,\" Acts 10:49, \"seeing that these received the Holy Ghost like we did at the...\" And he commanded them, \"Before you leave the place, although you've received the Holy Ghost, come and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ.\" For, Peter was given the key to the Kingdom, saying, \"Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind it in Heaven.\" And what does a key do? It unlocks something, the mystery. [Acts 10:47-48], [Acts 19:4-5], [Matthew 16:19], [Matthew 18:18]\n\nL-208 And when Jesus said, \"Go, baptize them in the Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost,\" setting that there to blind the unbeliever. Watch! Why didn't Peter carry that out, word by word? He had to. If a man is baptized in the titles, \"Father, Son, Holy Ghost,\" he's never been baptized at all; he has no Name. Father is no name, Son is no name, and Holy Ghost is no name. The Holy Ghost is what It is; like, I'm a human. It is the Holy Ghost. Father is a title; I'm a father. Son is a title; I'm a son. Human is a title; that's what I am. But my name is William Branham. And the Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost is the Name of \"Jesus Christ.\" Jesus said, \"I come in My Father's Name.\" What is the Father's Name? Any son comes in his father's name. And the Father's Name is Jesus Christ. See? See what I mean? [John 5:43]\n\nL-209 If I told you to go down and get me something off of the counter down here, in the name of the mayor of the city. How many knows who the mayor of the city is? My good friend, Rich Vissing. Well, you wouldn't go down there and say \"in the name of the mayor of the city.\" You say, \"In the name of Richard Vissing.\" You people here in Jeffersonville knows who he is. And that's the reason He said, \"Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\" In Him dwells the Deity, the fullness of the Godhead bodily. He said, \"Baptize them in the Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost.\" [Matthew 28:19]\n\nL-210 Peter standing there with the revelation on which He built the Church, of Who He was, he said, \"Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ.\" And never... The keys turned in Heaven and on earth. \"There's not another Name under Heaven given among men whereby you must be saved.\" [Acts 2:38], [Acts 4:12]\n\nL-211 Why do you baptize in the Name of Jesus Christ? For the remission of sins. \"Whosesoever sins you remit, to them they are remitted.\" See? But if you don't think he's worthy and fit to be baptized, don't you do it. For, when you do it, that does it, see. You get what I mean? I can hear my Sav-... (the Word) calling, (calling down there to the grave) I can... (\"Won't you die with Me, so you can rise with Me?\")... -iour calling, I can hear my Saviour calling, (what's the world going to say?) \"Take thy cross, and follow, follow...\" Now, if you haven't been: Where He (He is the Word) leads me I... (there is the pool) Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way. Let's bow our head.\n\nL-212 Dear God, the pool is ready. Now speak to hearts, Lord. May they hear Christ, the Word, calling them, and go with Him all the way. 65-0801M, The God Of This Evil Age, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 157 min \"I'll go with Him through the garden. I'll go with Him to the pool. I'll take on His Name. I want to be one of the people He is calling for His Name. I'll believe His Word. I'll follow. I'll never flirt with the world. I'll be a true, espoused Bride. I'll not leave off one iota of His Word. Every request, I'll be a real, true Bride. Everything He requests me to do, that will I do. \"If my coming Husband wants me to let my hair grow, I'll do it. If He wants me to take off all this makeup, I'll do it. If He want... He tells me it's a evil spirit, the evil one I'm flirting with, with these sexy-looking clothes; I'll do it, I'll take them off. I don't care what anybody else says, I'll take them off. \"He wants me to come out of that group that I'm with, of unbelievers, I'll do it; though I make my bread, or whatever it is. He promised He would never leave me nor forsake me. I'll--I'll do it. I'll go with Him all the way. He wants me to be baptized in His Name, I'll do it.\" Lord, You promised it in Your Word here, that's what You wanted. May every person see it, Lord, and sweetly, humbly bow to It. In Jesus' Name I pray. Amen. [Hebrews 13:5]\n\nL-213 You belong to God. May God take the little broken words and make them real to you, is my sincere prayer. The pool will be ready. Anybody that wants to come, they have... The minister will announce that a little later. Anybody that's repented and wants to be baptized, using the Name of Jesus Christ, you just come right ahead. Everything is ready. \"All things are ready.\" Everything that we can do to help you to live for God, we're here to do it. God bless you.\n\nL-214 Now let us stand. Now our little song, I Love Him. \"I love Him because He first loved me.\" Let's sing it, everybody now. I love Him,... Let's raise our hands as we sing it. ... I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree. With our heads and hearts bowed now, let's hum it to Him. [Brother Branham begins humming I Love Him--Ed.] I love Him. [Brother Branham continues humming I Love Him--Ed.] O God, our Father, be merciful to us poor creatures, Lord. Strengthen us for the job that lays ahead. Help me, O God, help me! I feel that something is laying right out here, Father. Help me, O God, to know the Truth. Bless these people, dear God. Lead them, I pray, in Jesus' Name.\n\nL-215 Now while we bow our heads, I'm going to ask the pastor here, Brother Neville, our precious brother, step right up here now and say what he's going to, about whether... about the baptism. I might announce that. I think the pool is open, though. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

The Lord bless you. I got into something, didn't I? I want to thank the Lord, real well, for undertaking for Brother Capps' boy. It just so happened that this is the little time that I come back to Indiana. I know that they're not recording this; I suppose they're not. And so then I don't see nobody in there, so they... I come back to go squirrel hunting. And so I guess Charlie is going to have to put up with me, him and Nellie, and them down in Kentucky, now for a day or two, to squirrel hunt. So, I'd rather miss anything, any other kind of recreation, then come here on... about the middle of August, and go squirrel hunting with Charlie and Banks, and all of them. It's kind of a traditional thing with me. And so I took Joe...\n\nL-2 When we was here the other time, everybody got sick, the change from that real hot climate down to this--to this cool climate you got here. I know you think this is not cool, but you come out to Arizona once. It was a hundred and nine in the shade when I left the other morning; and then at around midnight, in the night, when the cool air come down off the mountains, it was still ninety-six. Uh-huh. See, that's at midnight, when the cool air was coming down. And so it's... That place is all right in the wintertime, but it's for scorpions and lizards in the summertime, not human beings. Even all the animals take off for the mountains. They just can't stand it.\n\nL-3 And I had been out and shooting my little rifle in. I... Somehow I just want to tell you about the little Capps boy. And I said... And, Joe, I'll just have to give him the rifle, 'cause he can outshoot me. We had got it shot in, and I was--I was driving tacks at fifty yards. And I said to--to Joe... Joe said, \"Daddy, I believe I could do that.\" Poor little fellow had had a headache. I had been praying for him, a high fever. He went out to the range with me, and I...\n\nL-4 Any two-over-ten bore in a twenty-two rifle, it crosses its line of fire at twenty-five yards; is in again at fifty, just the same, if it is two-over-ten. So then... And I had shot it in at twenty-five yards. And so I had two more tacks and I put them up, and if Joe didn't drive both them tacks! I didn't have no more tacks, so I put a little bit of piece of an old clay pigeon had been bursted there, what trap shooters shoot at, just about a quarter of an inch across, and took it out on fifty yards, and he cut it half in two. And the scope was set for my eyes, just a few years older than he was. So he said, \"You know what? I've got to go by and tell Billy to keep off of my feet from now on.\"See? [Brother Branham and congregation laughs--Ed.]\n\nL-5 So, so I said, \"Well, I'll tell you what,\" said, \"let's go down and show Brother Norman that.\"\n\nL-6 I said, \"Joe, in matches across the world, I don't care who it would be, nobody...\" Now, the tacks wasn't drove sideways, they were drove straight through. And that piece, not over, I guess, a quarter of an inch, and a sixteenth thick, and a quarter of an inch high, he cut it half in two, at fifty yards. I said, \"There is no one in the world could have made a better shot. They could, champions, could have done the same thing, but you couldn't have made three better shots than them.\" The tacks, not bent, just a straight hole through the paper where the tack went through. And I said, \"No one could have made a--a better shot.\" All right. I think his headache left him right away.\n\nL-7 And I said, \"Well, let's go show this to Brother Norman,\" which works for the Field And Stream, Brother Tony Stromei's sporting goods place.\n\nL-8 He said, \"Let's go by Billy's first.\" He said, \"I--I just want to tell Bubby something.\" See? And, frankly, his brother has never done that good. So he said, \"We go by there first.\"\n\nL-9 And just as I got in the door, Billy was still in his pajamas. And he said... We went down early, 'cause it gets so hot. And so he said... The phone rang. And I said... He kind of looked at me like that. I said, \"Maybe a sick call.\"And it was Brother Capps for his boy, in the operating room then, with peritonitis and that pending. And just now he told me his boy is recovering real, real good.\n\nL-10 So, see how God just worked that, even in the voice of that little boy, Joe? Instead of going down to Brother Norman's, wouldn't have been there, and come up. And Brother Capps and I joined together. I don't say it was our 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min prayers that done it, but it did mean something to him for us to make contact like that. And, frankly, that's what... When you got--you got to have faith in what you're doing. See? And, that, his faith to call, and Billy was...\n\nL-11 They was putting in money. He said, \"This must be a real long distance,\" said, \"he was putting in pretty near five dollars worth of change, in a three... for a three minute call.\" And I thought it would be coming from New York or out in one of the islands or something. But he made a person-to-person call, to get Billy instead of Loyce, you see, and that's what cost him to do that.\n\nL-12 And now his boy is recovering. Brother Capps said the doctor give him very little hope of ever coming out of it, you see, from the operation. And we are thankful to God this morning for this, very glad for it.\n\nL-13 Now, we got in, towards daylight this morning, and I had about three hours sleep, and--and I'm pretty tired. But when the church... come time to come to church, why, I come down.\n\nL-14 And the Lord willing, now I've got to go down in Kentucky, as I said. Then I got promised to speak one Sunday while I was back here, and I had better make it this next Sunday, because the following I'll be... I have to go back. Because I'm going away again, up in Canada. So I--I better make it next Sunday, and next Sunday morning.\n\nL-15 And Brother Neville said, \"Why don't you just go out and greet the people, and talk to them just a few minutes?\"\n\nL-16 I said, \"Brother Neville, I haven't even opened my Bible, hardly.\" I said, \"I...\"\n\nL-17 He said, \"Well, go out and say something to them.\" And, Sister Neville, I--I--I don't know how you do it. He's a very persuasive fellow. But while...\n\nL-18 I don't get a chance to say this when the place is all packed, and crowded, and everything, but I'm very grateful to God for a pastor like Brother Orman Neville. Faithful, just as faithful as he can be, to the Cause, and never hear him grumbling. I sit back there... I had a good half-hour's talk with him while I was enjoying Brother Mann, and so I'll tell him more about that when we get in Colorado this year. So when we was enjoying his message, and I got a good talk with Brother Neville. I said, \"I don't even get to tell the people nothing about our fine pastor.\" I said, \"Are the people treating you right?\" Said, \"It couldn't be any better.\" And I said, \"Well, that's what I'm glad to hear.\"\n\nL-19 When a pastor is satisfied, and the people is satisfied, it makes a real good church, and then God is satisfied. And I think, to see them satisfied together, especially in this day of the Message that we're carrying, I think that shows the continuity of the Message with the people and with God. See?\n\nL-20 And I'm very grateful for Brother Orman Neville, and his fine wife and family. And I pray that God will keep them loyal to Him and the Cause. And if it so please Him, may we be standing here in the tabernacle when the Lord Jesus comes for us, you see, to take us away at the Rapture. We hope we're both so old, Brother Neville, that one will have one arm around the other, and standing there on our canes, still trying to hold up. See? \"Then we'll be changed, in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye.\" [I Corinthians 15:52] And these old robes of flesh will drop, And rise and seize the everlasting prize, And shout while passing through the air, \"Farewell, farewell,\" sweet hour of prayer. We moved on up then.\n\nL-21 Heard about Brother Coomers' healing from the Lord, and so thankful for that. So many things. So I am grateful to be here this morning. And I thought, instead of...\n\nL-22 I'm always coming here with a certain text, and speaking. I thought I'd just come out this morning. And I said, \"Brother Neville, I'll watch the clock real easy, and probably let the people out on time, and just talk to you from my heart, a few minutes; just things just, that we just have... No, they're not taping it or anything, so we just have fellowship while there's just the church folks here, you see, just us together.\" 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min So let's pray.\n\nL-23 Dear Jesus, we are grateful to You for the privilege that we have of assembling together here. And, oh, as I looked upon this tabernacle early this morning, after midnight, passed by, I thought of how You have stood by it.\n\nL-24 And I think of the old pond that was here, and big old weeds standing up, right about where this pulpit is at. As a little boy, I--I stood here. Mr. Ingram said we could have the lot for just a little money, and pay something down; and no money, no collateral, or nothing to offer, but just to try. How that it, then, as full face value was a little over two thousand dollars; with twenty years to pay it out.\n\nL-25 And now, Lord, look at it now! And while it was in its infancy, still sitting down in a hole here, water pouring into it; how that You promised us, by the Word: \"I the Lord have planted it, I'll water it day and night, lest some shall pluck it from My hands.\" [Jeremiah 24:6]\n\nL-26 The same time, the people said, \"Within six months, it'll be turned into a garage.\"\n\nL-27 But literally thousands of souls has found Christ here at the altar. And the tabernacle, the baptistery has constantly... People has been baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus; calling upon His Name, washing away their sins. Hundreds of crippled, afflicted, blind, halt, lame, cancer-eaten, have walked away from this platform; come in, dying, men and women, boys and girls, and gone out to live a new life, with a new flesh on their bodies, and walking again; leave their wheel chairs, crutches, and so forth. O God, this thirty years of service!\n\nL-28 Father, I remember the morning that we laid the cornerstone. And You gave the vision over there, showing the place, packed and jammed, a beautiful corner; I--I knew that that could not fail. So I thank You for all these things.\n\nL-29 Many of them has done fought a good fight, and finished the course, and kept the Faith; laying yonder, waiting, resting now from their labors, and their works following them; waiting for the hour for the trumpet to sound, and to spring forth again unto new life, a new body. Many of them old and shaken, some young, middle-aged, and so forth. But Thy Name be praised for all.\n\nL-30 Now we're standing here again, before the--the living and the dead. I pray that You'll anoint Your Words this morning. I don't know one thing to say, but I pray that You'll furnish that, which You've always did it, Lord.\n\nL-31 Bless our pastor, Brother Neville, his wife. Bless the trustees, deacon boards, every member of the body. May, together, we live so in this life, that in the life to come we'll have Eternal Life.\n\nL-32 Help us this morning to take corrections from the Spirit and the Word, that we might prepare ourselves as we move away from the doors this morning, determined in our heart to live a better life than we have in the past. We ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-33 Now, I--I just opened the Bible here, and it happened to be a few minutes ago. I'm in Revelations 3, so I'll just read here, on the--the Message to the Laodicea Church.\n\nL-34 And I want to announce, also, Brother Neville was just telling me; Brother Parnell, as I happened to look down and see him sitting here, is in a--in a revival, just this side of Memphis. At the--the... any of you know where the old Wimpy, the hamburger stand used to be, he's got a--a tent setting in there, trying to bring in the sheaves and find if there's any lost ones out in that way that's been ordained to life, that he might win through his ministry to Christ. And he closed it up for Sunday, on account of the services being at the tabernacle, and--and that's very loyal of the brother. And we want you to know that the services will be open Monday night following, next week. And I know you're all cordially invited out to hear Brother Parnell bring his message of the love of Christ.\n\nL-35 And now let us read from Revelations the 3rd chapter, just a portion, to say that we read the Bible. Because, what I would say might fail, but what He says won't fail. And I don't know where to start from, what to do, where to go, but I'm just reading the Laodicea Church Age. ... unto the angel of the church of... Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, and the beginning of the creation of God; I know thy works,... thou art neither cold nor hot: I would... wert that cold or hot. 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased in goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou are wretched,... miserable,... poor,... blind,... naked: I counsel of thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich;... white raimnent, that thou mayest be clothed, and that thy shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. [Revelation 3:14-19]\n\nL-36 You know, somewhere in there, as I was reading, I... If you'll excuse me a minute, I--I found some place that sounded good to me, and I don't know just where it was at now. Here it is. ... and knowest thou not... wretched,... miserable,... poor,... blind,... naked: [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-37 Oh, my, that's kind of the picture here of the church of today! Now, it's, I--I think that that church age here, that we're speaking of... Course, I've got the church age coming forth now in the books. But being that is the Laodicean Church Age that we're in, let's just look at the conditions.\n\nL-38 I don't want to take any text or anything, because we're not... just talking casually, as we see to talk on whatever the Lord would lead us to do, but something that would help us.\n\nL-39 Let's think of the Laodicea Church Age and its condition today. As far as I know, I don't see anything to hinder, at this time, the Coming of the Lord Jesus, outside of the readiness of His Church. I think that one of the--the prophesies... [Revelation 3:14-21]\n\nL-40 Yesterday, coming up in the car, we drove it in two days, from Tucson, here, right two thousand miles, Billy and I. And so we, now, that wasn't breaking any speed laws. We stayed right. I sat there, if he's driving, and I--I rolled--rolled up my fists back like a shotgun with the hammer back. I seen him go over. I said, \"Wait a minute, boy.\" Now, we're told, \"Give Caesar what's Caesar's.\"\n\nL-41 Then we come in down here last night, a little girl lying sprawled across the road, about three years old; mother dead over in the ditch. Some drunken boy, coming from the R.O.T.C., is eighteen years old, driving a hundred and twenty miles an hour, on the left hand side of the road, killed. And I guess he was dying, too. Then you could realize what it is. \"Give Caesar what's Caesar's.\"\n\nL-42 Innocent people dying. A little three-year-old girl lost her life, because of some drunken soldier, see, driving hundred and twenty miles an hour, estimated, on the wrong side of the road. Coming up over the hill, and shot right down, and killed them all right there together. I... He was dying, too. So then you can see, even though the innocent party was doing...\n\nL-43 Now that boy is guilty of cold-blooded murder. See? I think if a man would be caught on the road, drinking, he ought to be given ten years, flat, for premature... premeditated murder; any man, 'cause he just... any man.\n\nL-44 We, we'll never do any good with politics. It's rotten. God's idea of having a king, a righteous king, is right. But politics just simply spread out, you can buy anything out; cheat, lie, steal, everything else. As I said a few Sundays ago: and look where you're at, see, nothing but just a crooked mass of everything. But a righteous king can make his own laws. And you can kill a man; you know a good politics, that's all right, you get out of it. See? And so, it's, it--it...\n\nL-45 The democracy is a good idea, but it won't work. Just like communism, all things in common; it sounds good, but it won't work. No. The God's way of having a king, like David was, was right, and you got one mind centered over. Like one leader and a bunch of geese, or so forth, you can't take two or three of them. Then, you mess them all together, you come up with any kind of an idea.\n\nL-46 So we find the conditions, today, ready for the Coming of the Lord.\n\nL-47 But, while Brother Neville and I, and these other brothers are trying to shepherd a flock, I've got something on my mind now, that comes, that we might talk about. 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min\n\nL-48 That is, I got a letter the other day from a fine lady. I never got it; it come through another person. And she was certainly tearing me to pieces, or trying to. Was saying, \"Did you ever... Can't you Christian Business Men do something to stop Brother Branham?\" Said, \"Because that he's got this book out now called The Laodicea Church Age, bringing out more.\" And said, \"He's just simply tearing Pentecostal doctrine to pieces.\" Said, \"Now he's talking about the initial evidence ain't speaking in tongues.\" And said, \"Then, he's against women preachers.\" And this was a woman preacher. And her boys, some of the best friends that I got in the world. She... They're among the best friends that I got. And she said, \"Now...\"\n\nL-49 And this man and wife, I was eating breakfast with them; they said, \"Brother Branham, look at this. Would you think it?\" and pulled out a letter. I said, \"Well, sister, she just don't understand.\"\n\nL-50 The boys told me their mother was a woman preacher, and that she didn't go for the Message.\n\nL-51 And now she says in here, she said, \"Now he said, 'Women should not have authority over man.'\" Said, \"How about Phebe in the Bible, Paul's helper?\"\n\nL-52 Certainly, she was a seller of goods. And Paul asked the people... Do you think Paul would say, \"Let the women keep silent in the churches, not permitted them to speak,\" and turn around and say, \"Now, Phebe, my helper in the Gospel, she is going to preach a few nights\"? Why, he would contradict his own word. See? [I Timothy 2:12], [Romans 16:1], [Judges 4:4]\n\nL-53 And said, then, to top it all, \"I believe it was Esther... was one of the judges in the Bible.\" Said, \"A woman was a judge in the Bible. If that's not authority over man!\" [Judges 4:4]\n\nL-54 And this businessman that was healed right here in the church not long ago, he said... Now, his wife said, \"Brother Branham, that always puzzled me.\" I said, \"Why, sister, how would that puzzle you?\" Said, \"Well, here is a woman judge.\" [Judges 4:4] I said, \"That's politics, not the church. That don't have nothing to do with the church.\"\n\nL-55 Paul said, \"Let them be under obedience, as also saith the law.\" And the law can't put a woman up to be a priest; can't put it up. You never seen a woman high priest. You never seen a woman a priest, nowhere in the Bible. You never seen a woman a preacher, in the Bible. Certainly. [I Timothy 2:12]\n\nL-56 Some of them was prophetesses, and so forth; Miriam and different ones. And Esther... One of them was a judge over Israel. Sometimes they were queens over them, and so forth like that, king and queen. At the decease of the king, the queen had to take his place till they elected another king, and so forth. [Exodus 15:20], [Judges 4:4]\n\nL-57 In--in Tucson, Arizona, we got a woman judge there in the city. That's the reason the city is so polluted. And we got... A woman ain't got no business in politics. She ain't got no business in the... over any authority in the church.\n\nL-58 Her place is a man's queen at home. Outside of that, she has nothing. And we know that to be the Truth. You'll never find... I know that sounds old-fashioned, but I'm responsible.\n\nL-59 And I know that, after my going away from this earth, them tapes and them books will be living on, and many of you young children will find, in the days to come, that this is exactly the Truth, because I speak it in the Name of the Lord.\n\nL-60 Now, we wonder how a woman, that's a good woman, and she has brought on this earth by her loyal husband, a good man, some of the finest boys that I ever met, they're man, that I've ever met. And just quickly, just as soon as they heard the Message, they were sold on It, one hundred percent. Now, that could only come by foreordination. It's the only way it can come. [Acts 13:48]\n\nL-61 Now, the question is, here. I was thinking that, see, now why the Lord was bringing me back. \"And know it, knowest... Know it not; thou art naked, miserable, wretched, blind, and know it not.\" [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-62 Before I get to that spot, I might brief what I said a few days ago, here in a Message on, I believe it was, The God 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min Of This World; blinded the eyes of the people, that they absolutely worship the devil in religious services. Did you all get that? All of you understood it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-63 And then in that same Message, I brought the subject, that, a woman wearing immoral clothes, indecently, she is be judged at the Judgment Bar as a street prostitute. That sounds awful strange. Let me draw you a little picture. [I Timothy 2:9-10]\n\nL-64 Now, here is an attorney in the city, a young fellow, and he's a nice man. As far as--as politically, I imagine he may be decent as any, his politics. And then he goes with a girl that's very popular. They fall in love and marry. They attend to all the parties and the great things, and they all drink together. Finally, she... He has a nice home. He lives in a nice neighborhood. He is well thought of amongst the people. But he... Both of them drink. She wears shorts, cuts her hair, wears makeup, everything just as sexy-ish, beautiful woman displaying herself. Well, she never goes to church, at all, neither one of them.\n\nL-65 So, move in, next door to them, comes a woman from the Baptist church or the Methodist church, her and her husband. Now, this woman...\n\nL-66 Let's make it Methodist, because the Methodist go a little more on holiness than the Baptist; all except the New Testament Baptist, they believe in holiness. But, usually, Baptists don't go for holiness at all, see. They don't believe in such a thing. So then, now, let's make it Methodist 'cause they believe in holiness.\n\nL-67 And then a Methodist woman moves next door to this woman, on the same street. Her husband is a... Let's say he's a public accountant, and, or some office. Well, this Methodist woman looks over to the other woman.\n\nL-68 And when this lawyer goes out of town... His name is John; say his name is John. Now, don't presume on that now. I'm just taking fiction names now. And his name is John. Well, she used to go with Ralph. And that's fiction name, all of it, see, just so you get the story, to make the picture.\n\nL-69 Well, first thing you know, at a drunken party, Ralph hugs her again. Well, she gets all fired up, because she's in love again with Ralph, she thinks. Then, after a while, Ralph begins to meet her. And she can put it over John, pull it over his eyes. And she thinks she's a pretty smart duck, because she can run with Ralph, married to John. See, the woman don't even have the very bearing of decency, and she thinks nothing about that.\n\nL-70 But this Methodist woman has raised up in another bracket. She does, at least, go to church, and she thinks that that woman is horrible. Why, she says to her husband, when he comes in, \"I see that man go in there and meet her. And when John is out on a case somewhere, Philadelphia or somewhere, he takes her out in his roadster, and they lay out on the beach. I see them come home; don't even pull the curtains down sometimes, kissing her and making love to her, next... Oh, isn't that awful?\" she says to her husband. \"Why, she is nothing but a public prostitute.\" It's true. She is worse than a public prostitute, because she is a married woman. See? And she, this woman, this Methodist woman, thinks that's horrible, she never goes to church.\n\nL-71 Now, this Methodist woman would not do a thing like that. No, indeedy. She is a decent woman. And another thing, she would not touch a bit of whiskey, because, the Methodist church, ninety percent of their program is prohibition against whiskey, against whiskey. So, they got a prohibition program, and them people of that Methodist church don't live no higher than that church teaches.\n\nL-72 But this same woman, this Methodist woman, goes out, of a evening, with her husband, wearing shorts on Sunday, after Sunday school. She cuts her hair. She wears lipstick, and even smokes a little.\n\nL-73 Now, in God's Word, they are both prostitutes, but this one here is \"naked, miserable, wretched, blind, and don't know it.\" One is just as guilty as the other, for, \"A man that looks upon a woman, to lust after her, has committed adultery with her already in his heart.\" [Matthew 5:28], [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-74 And if this woman, now, she would say, \"Wait just a minute, Mr. Branham. I'll give you to understand, I am no prostitute.\" My sister, maybe if you'd be took before a Bible, and put your hands upon It in the Presence of God, and swear an oath that you've been just as true-l, true to your husband as you could be. Your body belongs to your husband, 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min but your soul belongs to God. There is a evil spirit that's anointed you. If that, if you are not, then you're... I can prove that you're totally insane.\n\nL-75 What would have happened to your grandmother if she'd have walked out on the street with those shorts on? They'd have put her in the insane institution; she come out without her dress on. There is something wrong with her mind. If it was so then, it's so now. [Deuteronomy 22:5]\n\nL-76 So it throws the whole world into insanity. The whole thing is insane. And it so gradually crept in till the people don't know it.\n\nL-77 Now, is she a prostitute? Not by her husband, vow to her body. But, before God, she has got an evil, prostitute spirit on her, that makes her dress like that. And she's in the Laodicean Church Age, and don't know that she's doing that. The innocent woman don't know that God will judge her for a prostitute. There you are. [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-78 You get It to her; you can't tell her. There is no way of getting It to her. The Bible said, \"They're naked and don't know it.\" [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-79 If you would call her a prostitute, personally, she would have you arrested. She would. I never talk personally about anybody. I talk about sin. I don't say, \"This certain church, Mr. So-and-so there, Rev. So-and-so, he's a...\" No, no. I say that, the doctrine of that, see, the whole thing together. I don't call individual. It's not individuals. It's the system that they're in. It's the world system.\n\nL-80 Brother George Wright sitting here is... He is seventy-five or seventy-eight years old, I guess. What would you think would have happened if you would have went to seen Sister Wright some day, and she would have been standing in a pair of shorts? Why, you'd have never, you'd--you'd have had the woman locked up. You'd have never married her. Well, if any young man in that day would have done it, the same thing would have took place. Well, if it was sin and wrong then, it's the same thing; but the people has growed into insanity.\n\nL-81 Let me prophesy something to you, just before it comes to pass. The whole world is grouping in insanity, and will get worse and worse and worse, until they'll be a bunch of maniacs. And it's almost that way now.\n\nL-82 Could you imagine a man driving with his lights off, on the wrong side of the road; a ricky, young kid, supposed to be right out of high school, kill a bunch of people. Does that stop them? The next one come right behind him, doing the same thing. Can you imagine a young man that thinks any self... anything of himself, getting out here and acting the way they do?\n\nL-83 Could you imagine a young woman, and a bloom of womanhood, beautiful, well-built, shaped, profile, face, beautiful; and the very thing of her being pretty shows that we're at the end time. See, she has went all together to worldly feature, worldly things and not the beauty of holiness, sweetness in her soul. I've seen women, on the outside of them wasn't nothing to look at, but you speak to them one time, talk to them a few minutes, they're a real genuine something that you can't get away from. See, beauty of the outside is of the devil, it's of the world. [Proverbs 31:30], [I Timothy 2:9]\n\nL-84 Look at Cain's children, how they went into it. \"When the sons of God saw the daughters of man were fair, they taken unto them wives,\" and God never did forgive them. [Genesis 6:1-3]\n\nL-85 Look, when them Israelite women with--with calloused hands, and hair stringing; when them sons of God came up through the land of Moab, and met them dainty women with well-set hair, and fancy, and a lot of manicure on their faces, or what you call it; and when them sons of God saw those real fair women, a false prophet said, \"We're all the same.\" [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit six times--Ed.] And they married among them, and God never did forgive them. [Genesis 6:2], [Numbers 25:1]\n\nL-86 They perished in the wilderness. Every one of them died there, without hope, without God, and is Eternally lost; damned forever, though they had seen the goodness of God, though they had drank from the fountain that never runs dry. They had drunk from the smitten rock. They had seen the brass serpent perform miracles. They come out from under the baptism of Moses in the sea. They had seen the hand of God. They had eat Angel's food, and had done all of 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min those things. But married in, let women bring them in, and marry among them. Not commit adultery, just marry among them; God never did forgive it. [Exodus 17:6], [Numbers 21:9]\n\nL-87 That's the second time it met. Now here we are on third time, more deceiving now than ever.\n\nL-88 I know that's hard. And I've often wondered, in many ways, how will it ever be? Why do I have to talk so rashel to people? What makes it so? And yet, I notice, if it wasn't God, there wouldn't be nobody, not a woman would sit and listen at me. But they come back, because there is somebody that's got a little anchor of Truth there, that knows that That's right. Regardless, they know It's right. Now watch what happens. I know it's hard.\n\nL-89 It's just like if a doctor give you medicine, and you refused to take it, then don't blame the doctor if you die. And This is like medicine. What about these people that always claim to me being a woman hater?\n\nL-90 You see, you just watch the way the women act, and I'll show you where the church is. The women morals is in Laodicea, in the world, physically, \"naked, miserable, blind, and don't know it,\" the--the people, the women of the world. And the church is in the same stage. Watch the natural type the spiritual, right through, each time. Now, someday at the Judgment Bar... [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-91 I know it's not popular to say it. And if a man is not ordained to say it, you better not say it; 'cause you're impersonating, and then you'll get in trouble, sure enough.\n\nL-92 Now notice. I've actually, look like, in times, held a woman's mouth open and poured the Medicine in her mouth, and then hold my hands over her mouth, and she'll spit It out every time. What if a doctor did that to a patient, then the patient died because they refused to swallow the medicine? At the Judgment Bar, when all these things like cutting hair and wearing shorts and...\n\nL-93 I'm only building. The hour is close at hand when you're going to see something happen, when something is going to take place. And all this background here has only been laying a foundation for a short, quick Message that will shake the whole nations.\n\nL-94 Why I been picking on women, it's just been laying up here for something that you can hit it right on the head, with it. Even trying to tell them what's right. And I holding a hand down like this, as it where the mouth, and they spit It out. Then who can blame the doctor?\n\nL-95 How you going to say, at the Day of the Judgment, when the very voices that's cried out against it, will play the record right back in the face of the people? Then how they going to get away from it?\n\nL-96 Spit It out between your fingers. Pour some more down, then finally shake their head and revolt back, and go back, won't do it. Yet, you come back again and pour It in again. Then who is to blame? Not the doctor, not the Medicine, but the attitude of the person. That's exactly. Be a horrible day, one of these days, when this sinful adulter-ness generation stands before Almighty God.\n\nL-97 I see my years creeping up, my shoulders stooping; and, I know, thirty years here in this platform, yeah, thirty-three years here on the field. That's a long life. That's thirty-three years of service. Only one regret I have; that I didn't have a hundred and thirty-three years of it. For this will be the last opportunity I'll ever have, while here mortal, to preach the Gospel. God help me to stand true as true can be, to that Word, and say just as He says.\n\nL-98 What made that Methodist woman... How could you ever get It to her? Here she is, in that Laodicea Church Age.\n\nL-99 Now we'll take the Pentecostal woman. She shouldn't wear shorts, make-up, or cut her hair, but she looks back down at the Methodist, say, \"Look at that woman do so-and-so!\" Say the woman don't wear shorts, but she say... and herself with bobbed hair. See?\n\nL-100 Higher you rise in God, the more sinful the whole thing looks. And then sometimes, in prayer, you can imagine, when the Holy Spirit take you up into a sphere, then the whole thing looks chaos. Then when you come back down, you seem like you're, to the people, you're a rascal, that you're--you're nothing but an old sarcastic. You're a fool, because you stand as an old crank and always rebuking the people. But if you ever climb into them spheres one time, where you can be in the Presence of God (not through emotion, but through genuine Holy Spirit lifting up), the whole 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min thing is wrote, \"ICHABOD.\" The Glory of the Lord has departed from the whole denominational outfit. That's right. There none of them that's right. [I Samuel 4:21]\n\nL-101 Now let me draw you a little circle. If I had a blackboard... But I want you to watch here. [Brother Branham draws the following rings on something--Ed.] I'm going to make one ring like this, and I'm going to make another ring on the inside of that ring, that's two, then I'm going to make a ring on the inside of that ring. That's three rings, three circles. Now, that's you.\n\nL-102 That's God. God in a trinity is One, and without a trinity He's not God. He can't be manifested any other way.\n\nL-103 And neither can you be manifested without being the trinity person that you are, that's: body, spirit, soul. Without either one of them, you're not complete. See? You didn't have a soul, you'd be nothing; you didn't have a spirit, you wouldn't be nothing; you didn't have a body, you just be a spirit, not a body.\n\nL-104 So, God is complete in the tri-unity of a Being; not tri-unity of beings, but One Being in a tri-unity. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is one true manifested God. God! [I Corinthians 8:6], [I Timothy 3:16]\n\nL-105 Notice here, just wait, I--I believe I read it just a few minutes ago. Listen to this. ... unto the angel of the church of... Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; [Revelation 3:14]\n\nL-106 God is the Creator. And how was He ever created? But this is \"the beginning of the creation of God.\" When God, the Spirit, was created in a form of a Man, that was God being created; God the Creator, Himself, becoming a creation. God, Who made the dirt, made the calcium, made the potash, cosmic light, petroleums, took the thing together and created Himself, in \"the beginning of the creation of God.\"\n\nL-107 \"The Amen,\" the final. Amen means \"so be it.\" \"The final of God,\" when God completed in His creation.\n\nL-108 Now, how was it? \"No man has seen God at any time, but the only Begotten of the Father has declared Him.\" You get it? [John 1:18]\n\nL-109 Say, just a minute, you no hurry. Let's turn over to Colossians, just a minute. I just happened to... come a Scripture in my mind. Let's turn to Colossians, the Book of Colossians, and get the... I believe it's the 1st chapter. I'll have to look at this, 'cause it's not premeditated here. So I'll... As I used to be, when I was a young preacher, I could think of these things [Brother Branham snaps his finger--Ed.] just right now, but as I get older I can't. Let's begin at the 9th verse, I believe. \"For this cause...\" Is Paul telling the Colossians about Christ, Who He was. For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and... desire that you might be filled with all the knowledge of his will in all wisdom of spirit and understanding; That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and to the increase in the knowledge of God; Strengthened all... according to the glorious power, of patience and longsuffering with joy; Giving thanks to the Father, which has meet... which made us meet to... partakers of the inheritance of the saints... Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: [Colossians 1:9-15]\n\nL-110 Here we're getting now. Watch. In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sin: Who is in the image of the invisible God,... Get it? 15th verseColossians 1:15. ... the firstborn of every creature: [Colossians 1:14-15]\n\nL-111 Amen! The what? \"The firstborn of every creature.\" Let it be Angel, let it be any what it may be; He's the firstborn of every creature. For by him were all things created--all things created, that are in heaven, or... in earth, visible... 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min invisible, whether they be thrones, whether they be dominions,... principalities,... powers: all things were created by him, and for him: [Colossians 1:16]\n\nL-112 Let it be anything it might be; no other being! Notice, \"And in... And he is therefore...\" ... he is before all things, and by him all things consist. [Colossians 1:17]\n\nL-113 Whether it be Father, Son, Holy Ghost, whatever it is, \"He is before all things.\" \"Before all things that's in Heaven, in earth; visible, invisible, or anything,\" this Son of God was before all things. That right? I don't care, it's thrones, dominions, whatever it is; Heavenly thrones, kingdoms, whatever it might be in the great supernatural realms beyond, in the Eternities where it was; whatever it was, Angels, gods, whatever it was, \"He is before all things.\" Amen! Can't you see Him? \"He was before all things; and were created by Him. He...\" The 17th verse. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. [Colossians 1:17]\n\nL-114 There is nothing can make it run but Him. Whether it's God the Father, God the Holy Ghost; whether it's the Angels, principalities, powers, dominions; whatever it is, all things run by Him. \"All things consist by Him.\" He! And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning--who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead (that is, raise up what He come to redeem); that in all things he might have the preeminences. [Colossians 1:17]\n\nL-115 \"Might have preeminence,\" you know what it means? That's, \"over all.\" He is over all things that was ever created; every Angel, every being, every--every thing that there is. He is over all things. What Creature is This? Who can it be? Over all things! \"And having made peace...\" Let's see, just a minute. Preemi-... For it pleased the Father that in him should all the fulness dwell; [Colossians 1:19] \"All the fullness of all things.\" All the fullness of God, all the fullness of Angels, all the fullness of time, all the fullness of Eternity; everything dwelt in Him. That's this Fellow. And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. [Colossians 1:20]\n\nL-116 There is that great Being we're talking about, \"The beginning of the creation of God.\"\n\nL-117 Now, now that, the Church, that His very whole purpose was the Church. Now how do we get into this Church? \"By one Spirit we're all baptized into one Body,\" the Church, the Body of Christ. It cannot fail.\n\nL-118 Now, here is what happens. Now watch this, just a little figurative picture here. [Brother Branham again shows his drawing of three rings--Ed.]\n\nL-119 Now, this outside man is the flesh. That's what we look at; what we see. And it has five inlets to that body. And any grammar school child, as myself, would know there is five senses control the body; see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. Without that, you can't touch the body. That's the only way you have to the body; see, taste, feel, smell, hear; you see it, taste it, feel it... Now, that is the evil one, on the outside. [I Corinthians 12:13]\n\nL-120 Now, inside of that is a spirit, which you become when you're born in the earth and the breath of life is breathed into him. That spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from God, but it was (given) permitted by God. Now you got that? For, every child that's born in the world, \"is born in sin, shaped in iniquity; come to the world speaking lies.\" That right? So, that person, inside there, is a sinner, to begin with. Now, but... [Psalms 51:5]\n\nL-121 Now, it's got five inlets. And them five inlets... I don't know whether I can call them right off now. When the... First, I know, is thought, conscience, and love, choice... No. Conscience, love, reason... There is five inlets to the spirit. You can't think with your body; you have to think with your spirit. You can't have conscience in your body. It has no mental faculties at all; your body doesn't, so you have to think with your spirit. You have to reason. You can't reason with your physical being, 'cause reason doesn't see, taste, feel, smell, or hear. Reason is what you can make in your 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min mind. If you're asleep or you're out, your body is lying there dead, but your spirit can still reason. There is five senses that controls that inside man. And that...\n\nL-122 Now, to the last man, which is the soul, there is only one sense that controls that, and that is free... moral agency's free will to choose or to reject.\n\nL-123 And now the reason that people today... Now, don't forget this now, and you'll--you'll see what the Holy... what the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is. See?\n\nL-124 Now, people can live in this spirit, and they dance in the spirit. They shout in the spirit. They go to church in the spirit, and they can absolutely have the real Spirit of God anointed on that spirit, but still be lost and just as devil-possessed as they can be, with that spirit.\n\nL-125 Because, watch, that's the reason you couldn't tell that woman, she was wearing shorts, was wrong. You couldn't tell her bobbing her hair was wrong. \"Well, what's your hair got to do with it?\" Well, it did to Samson. See? [I Corinthians 11:3-12], [Numbers 6:2, 5]\n\nL-126 \"Whosoever shall add one word to This, or take one Word from It.\" You've got to have an ultimate somewhere. [Revelation 22:18]\n\nL-127 Now, for instance, if I was a--a--a--a Baptist man, and you come down and told me I must be--I must be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ; it's in the Bible. Well, first thing you know, I'd say, \"I'll ask my pastor.\"\n\nL-128 And I go to the pastor; he say, \"Oh, that's something back yonder, see. Yeah, see, we Baptists, here is what we believe; we believe that we should be immersed in the titles of 'Father, Son, Holy Ghost.' That's the way all the church has done it. Since John Smith founded it, that's the way it's done.\" Well, that's your ultimate. \"Heck with what that guy says!\" [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-129 What if you're a Methodist, and sprinkling is your system, and you are told you must be immersed? See what I mean? You go back to the Methodist pastor, and he'll write and ask the bishop, if so-and-so said so-and-so about this. \"But we, the Methodist church, we was founded three or four hundred years ago, in England, by John Wesley, and Whitefield, and all the rest of them there, and Asbury. We founded this document, following John Wesley, that we are to be sprinkled, because it's just an outward emo-... form. And we think that sprinkling is just as good as it is the other way.\"If you're a real... If the Methodist church is your ultimation, that's as far as you go. [Romans 6:4], [Revelation 22:18]\n\nL-130 If you're a Catholic... And I'll tell you, it's not in the Bible not to eat meat on Fridays, and all these things like this, and \"the Holy Eucharist isn't a wafer, because it's a Spirit,\" and so forth. And you go to your priest, the priest say, \"Here it is, wrote right in our document.\" And if the church is your ultimate, you don't give a hoot what anybody says. That's your ultimate.\n\nL-131 O God, help this to sink in! To me, the whole thing is wrong. God's Word is the ultimate. Whatever that Word says, then that's right.\n\nL-132 Now, the only way up here in this spheres, that you could ever be in this little inside man; and you have to be foreordained. Because you was with God, you're a part of God.\n\nL-133 I was in my father. I also was in my grandfather, and my grandfather's grandfather. By seed, I was in that. [Ephesians 1:4]\n\nL-134 And I was in Christ. You were in Christ before the foundation of the world. He came to redeem His Own, His Own that was in Him. Hallelujah! His children that was in Him!\n\nL-135 He never came to--to save the devil's children. They never will know It. And they are so shrewd in the ways of their intellectual learning, that you can't compare with them at all. You can't outtalk them. But, by faith you see It.\n\nL-136 Now, science don't need any faith. Science proves what they're talking about. It doesn't need any faith.\n\nL-137 The Catholic priest will tell you, \"Look how long the Catholic church has waved. Look how long she stood under the persecutions of paganism.\" 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min The Methodist church say, \"Looky here how long...\"\n\nL-138 I seen a church... talk about a hypocrite sign; coming up the road yesterday, I seen. Said, \"The church of Christ, established AD 33.\" It ain't a hundred years old yet, see, the denomination. Oh, my! \"Doctrine of the apostles\"? Hardly got anything. They're the Sadducees of the day; no Spirit, no... And you can't tell them; you can't talk to them; you can't reason with them.\n\nL-139 Because, we go beyond reasoning. \"Lean not to your own understanding.\" Faith doesn't reason at all. Faith believes It. [Proverbs 3:5]\n\nL-140 They say, \"Now, look here, do you believe we have to do these things back there? Nonsense! That...\"\n\nL-141 But the Bible said so. I can't explain how it happens, but it happens. God said so. So you don't have... I can't tell you nothing about it. Faith doesn't explain It. Did you know that? Faith just believes It.\n\nL-142 Jesus said to Nicodemus, from the San-... ecumenical council of His day; come to Him by night, said, \"Master, we know You're a Teacher comes from God, 'cause no man could do the things You do, unless God is with him.\" [John 3:2] He said, \"Verily, I say unto you, 'Except a man be born again, he can't even see the Kingdom of God.'\" [John 3:3, 5] Said, \"Me, an old man, enter into my mother's womb, to be born?\" [John 3:4] He said, \"Now how am I going to tell you Heavenly things, when you won't even believe earthly things?\" See? Then He said, one day, \"Except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, drink His Blood, you have no Life in you.\" He didn't explain it. [John 6:53]\n\nL-143 Those apostles and them of that day, who was ordained to Life; He knowed it. Said, \"All the Father has given Me will come. Only thing you have to do is just make My Voice known; they know it, for My sheep know My Voice.\" And a voice is a word expressed. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] \"They believe It, anyhow. They don't have to scientifically prove anything, or ask any Sadducee or Pharisee, or anything else, about it. I said it, they believe it, for My sheep hear My Voice.\" [John 6:37], [John 10:27], [Acts 13:48]\n\nL-144 And This is the Voice of God in letter form, because This is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ, Old and New Testament put together. Amen. There you are.\n\nL-145 Why? You say, \"These are good people. What makes them...\" Because, one thing, their tie post is on a church. And in here... You remember last Sunday's, a week ago; how many was here and heard the sermon on The Anointed Ones In The Last Days? I think all of you. See, they are anointed. Their spirits are anointed, in this second realm.\n\nL-146 Now, that first woman says... No, she don't give a hoot what the church says, what anybody else said. She's a smart duck. She's got college education. She could put it over on her husband, and think she is smart by doing that.\n\nL-147 This other woman is \"naked, blind, and don't know it.\" Oh, it's pitiful, but that's the picture the Bible paints us. Now, she goes to church. That woman, would probably be better, that woman would be... She lives a good, clean life; there is nothing against that. God will be the Judge of it. I don't know; I'm not the Judge.\n\nL-148 I'm only the... responsible for what He shows me. That's what the apostles said. \"We do speak that what we know, what we heard, what we seen.\" That's all I'm responsible for. That's all you're responsible for. [Acts 4:20]\n\nL-149 But now, you see, if you would take that same woman... Where did she wind up at? See? She moved right around. She heard, no doubt; turned the radio on, many times. The Voice of God has been speaking, many times. Well, now, see, she comes over into this cult here, a clan. All churches are clans. Everything, that's exactly right, they're just lodges where people group together as membership. And she comes over here; well, that fits her just right. Now if you go to telling her what she has to do, she won't listen to you. You show it to her in the Bible; she won't listen to It.\n\nL-150 Now, my dear brother, sister, just one or two more comments before closing. It's quarter till, time to let out; fifteen minutes.\n\nL-151 Now look, I want to ask you something. Why can't that woman see it? Why can't she? As far as being in adultery physically, to her husband, she's not guilty; she has nothing to confess. She's as clean as she was the day she was born; 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min no man has touched her.\n\nL-152 I'm speaking parallel now, to the woman, to the church. She's as clean as she was born. Well, that's exactly what the church is, as she was born, but she was \"born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come...\" See what I mean?\n\nL-153 Now you tell her that it's wrong for her to cut her hair; the Bible said so. It's wrong for her to wear them shorts; the Bible said so. She would say, \"Nonsense.\" Why? Her ultimate is not down here, in that third man, the soul that's predestinated and sent from God. But her ultimate is on an organization out here, that some man has organized outside of This. See?\n\nL-154 But if the Word of God is down in that soul, it says, \"Amen! I see it.\"It lines up with It. Now look here. Therefore, the man that's born of the Spirit of God...\n\nL-155 See, here is the outside flesh. And I speak in a mixed audience, going to speak as your--as your pastor, as your brother. Here is the flesh, it's weak, it's bound to... A little lady walks down the street; some young man just in his young age, when he's seventeen, eighteen, twenty years old, twenty-five, thirty, walks around in there... And this young lady comes, twisting every form, her body, walking with a pair of high-heeled shoes on; herself stuck all out in front and back; and dress is that high above her knees, or a pair of shorts on. Do you know the Bible said she would act like that? You know, the Bible said that's the way she would act, how she would be so filthy.\n\nL-156 Did you read this here, this month's Reader's Digest, that, \"Men and women of this day, little girls, from twenty or twenty-five years old, is in menopause,\" that you go through the change of life in the middle-age of life, according to science, between twenty and twenty-five. It used to be around thirty or thirty-five, in my age. In my mother's age, a woman never struck menopause till she was forty or forty-five.\n\nL-157 What is it? It's through science, and the food, the hybrids, that's perverted the whole human body till we've become a bunch of--of--of a mass of corruption. Well, if the physical being is corrupted, isn't the brain cell in that physical being?\n\nL-158 Now watch the Spirit, following it. There'll come a time, in the Name of the Lord, that people will go completely insane. The Bible says so. They'll scream and holler; great hideous things in their imaginary mind. The radios and things, our television programs, are producing it. There'll be such things as ants raise up on the earth, that will be as high as fourteen trees; there will be a--a--a bird will fly across the earth, with wings four or five miles across; and people see them, they'll scream and holler, and cry for mercy. But it'll be the Plagues. Wait till I preach on those Plagues opening up.\n\nL-159 Watch what Moses done under the physical being, not the Spirit, when He said, \"Moses...\" God said to Moses, \"Go out there,\" to His prophet, \"pick up a handful of dust, throw it up in the air and say, 'THUS SAITH THE LORD, fleas will come upon the earth.'\" There was no fleas. The first thing you know, they begin to see something crawl on a bush. Looked over, there is something else. And after a while, they was so deep you couldn't wade through them. [Exodus 8:16-24]\n\nL-160 Where did they come from? God is the Creator. He can do what He will. He is sovereign. He could make a--a bird that would reach--reach his wings from one side of the earth to the other.\n\nL-161 He said, \"Let there come flies, enclothed upon all the earth.\" There wasn't a fly in the land. First thing you know, an old blowfly begin to fly around. First thing, there was eight or ten, twelve. First thing you know, you couldn't walk through them. God, the Creator, keeps His Word.\n\nL-162 And he stretched forth his rod, at the command of God, and said, \"Let frogs come up and cover the earth.\" And the frogs come till they heaped them up, piles, and stink was everywhere, maybe forty or fifty feet high, of frogs. They were in the cupboard of--of Pharaoh. They were in the... turn down the sheet, and there would be a five hundred frogs under the sheet, under the bed, in the grub. Everywhere they went, was frogs, frogs, frogs. Where did they come from? God, the Creator, is sovereign. What He says, He'll do! [Exodus 8:2]\n\nL-163 And He said there'll be hideous sights upon the earth. \"Locusts with hair like women,\" long hair, to haunt them 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min women that cut their hair. \"Teeth like lion; stingers in their tails, like scorpions; they would torment men, months.\" Just wait till we get in to opening them Plagues and Seals, and them Seven Thunders, watch what takes place. Oh, brother, you better get to Goshen while there's time to get to Goshen. Don't pay any attention to this outside. [Revelation 9:3]\n\nL-164 Looky here. Here's a little lady twisting herself down the street; here's a young fellow, his eyes catches it. He's a member of the church. He's a Pentecostal. He's whatever he is. But the first thing you know, there's no hold post in there. She'll say, \"Hello.\" He's got curly hair, and kind of nice-looking, straight-shouldered young man; maybe tried to live right. She start walking up to him, even a preacher. The first thing you know...\n\nL-165 What is it? This out here, the flesh desire; and the spirit down here, yet anointed, saying, \"Don't do it, don't do it.\" But what will it do? It'll move right around, there hold, there it goes. First thing you know, he's trying to make a date with her. He is guilty of committing adultery, whether he touches her or not.\n\nL-166 But, a genuine, born-again son of God! Amen! You can't do it yourself. It's totally impossible for a--a red-blooded male to walk before a female like that, without something taking place. But when there is Something on the inside; that little born-again Something here!\n\nL-167 Though that man might have shouted, spoke in tongues, jumped, danced, everything else, anointed with the Spirit; done all the signs and wonders that God said in there, by His Spirit! Jesus said, \"Many will come to Me in that day, say, 'Lord, haven't I prophesied in Your Name? Haven't I cast out devils in Your Name? Have not... ' He said, 'Depart from Me, you that work iniquity.'\" What is iniquity? Something that you know to do, and don't do it. \"'Depart from Me, you that work iniquity; I didn't even know you.'\" [Matthew 7:22-23]\n\nL-168 But down on the inside of that man, if that little tie post is in there, that Seed of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world; I don't care what takes place, it holds him. It's there to stay.\n\nL-169 That's why that woman will wear them shorts. She is counted a prostitute, the same as the woman in the act. See? She doesn't know that that spirit... How does she know? Her ultimate.\n\nL-170 What is an ultimate? Is the last word. The ultimate is the amen. It's the end of all strife, your ultimate.\n\nL-171 And if your church, a Pentecostal church, that tells you that, \"Long hair and stuff is just fanaticism. You got a spare tire, the back of your head,\" and so forth, them kind of things, the man is possessed of the devil.\n\nL-172 For, God's Word said, \"It's a shame for a woman to cut her hair. She'll dishonor her head.\" If she dishonors her husband, and her husband is the Church, and the Church is Christ, she is a dishonorable religious prostitute; naked and don't know it. Naked! Don't the Bible said, \"The woman's covering is her hair\"? Isn't the hair give to her for a covering? [I Corinthians 11:5-6]\n\nL-173 Someday, yonder at the Judgment Bar! I've tried to pour the Medicine in, and hold It with my hands, and you spit It right straight back out between your fingers. God will judge them someday. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD. It hasn't been a bunch of foolishness, or some crazy old man all worked up. It isn't. Because, it's the Word of the Lord.\n\nL-174 And a real, genuine Christian will cope with that inside man, that Spirit that was back yonder at the beginning, which is the Word.\n\nL-175 As He was the fullness of all of you, you were in Him back yonder at Calvary. He foreknew you would be here. He only broadcast what would take place. And you were in Him; you died with Him. You died to your pride, you died to your fashions, you died to the world. When He... You died with Him in Calvary, and you arose with Him when He arose again on the third day. And because you've accepted it, now you're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah! [Ephesians 2:6]\n\nL-176 There you are. It's that inside man. That inside that will punctuate the Word, hang with the Word, regardless. You can't help it. I learned that, many years ago.\n\nL-177 My little baby laying here, dying. My wife laying here in a... in--in the morgue, embalmed and laid out. They called me out there, and Sharon was dying. That's the hardest temptation I ever met in my life. I was about twenty-five years old. I walked out there, and Billy Paul lying at the point of death. 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min\n\nL-178 Doctor Sam come, said, \"Bill, I don't think we're going to save Billy. And I...\" He said, \"He's so bad.\" Said, \"Bill, I feel so sorry for you.\"He put his arms around me. I said, \"Doc, I ain't got no more strength.\"\n\nL-179 Couple of hours, I called him, my baby, Sharon, I run her out there, he... to see her in spasm; it wouldn't stop. They put a needle in the spine; they punctured it, brought the sign up, tubercular meningitis. That's all.\n\nL-180 I waved my way out to the hospital; stopped my old truck out there, and got out and started walking down to the room. Here came Sam down the hall, with his hat in his hand, crying, put his arm around me, said, \"Come on back, Bill.\" I said, \"What's the matter?\" Said, \"You can't see her.\" Said, \"She is dying, Bill.\" And I said, \"No, Sam, not my baby.\"\n\nL-181 Said, \"Yep.\" Said, \"Don't even ask for her, Bill. She'd ever live,\" said, \"she'd be afflicted.\" Said, \"She'd always be drawed up, and she'd be afflicted all of her life.\" Said, \"She's got meningitis.\" Said, \"Don't go around her; you--you'll just kill Billy by doing it.\" I said, \"Sam, I got to see her.\"\n\nL-182 Said, \"You can't do it, Bill. I--I forbid you. Now, you know how much I think of you, and you're my buddy and everything,\" said, \"how much I think of you,\" said, \"and how much I believe you, Bill,\" he said, \"but don't--don't go to that baby.\" Said, \"If you do that,... Meningitis is on her.\" See? Said, \"She'll be gone in a few minutes, and,\" said, \"you can... we'll bury her.\" Said, \"Bill, I just feel so sorry for you.\"\n\nL-183 And he call, told, called a nurse, to order me some kind of medicine. Said, \"I don't know how the man is standing up.\"\n\nL-184 I stood there a little bit. He brought the medicine in. I sat down, in the hall. He said, \"Sit.\" And the nurse brought it, said, \"Drink this, Brother Branham.\"\n\nL-185 I said, \"Thank you. Just set it down there a minute.\" When she left like that, I poured it over in a spittoon; set the glass back down.\n\nL-186 I set there. I thought, \"O God, what have I done? You're a good God. Why did You let her die, the other day, me holding her two little arms like that?\" Begging Him for her. \"Why'd You let her go? There is Billy laying there, dying; and here she is, dying. What have I done? Tell me! Well, I just might as well go with them.\"\n\nL-187 I opened the door, and no nurse was there. I slipped down in the basement. That was before the hospital was fixed. Screens, no screens on the windows, hardly, and flies on her little eyes. Had a piece of mosquito bar, we call it, netting put over her face. I shooed the flies off; laid there. Her little eyes, she suffered so hard till they were crossing.\n\nL-188 Then Satan moved up by the side of me there, and said, \"Did you say He was a good God?\" I said, \"Yeah, I said that.\"\n\nL-189 \"Did you say He was a healer? Well, why did your father die in your arms over there, and you calling, him a sinner, calling for his life? Why did your brother die in your other brother's arms, out there, and you standing in the pulpit preaching, a few weeks ago?\" Said, \"Then why didn't He answer you? You said He loved you and saved you.\"\n\nL-190 He couldn't tell me there was no God, 'cause I already seen Him. But he was telling me He didn't care for me.\n\nL-191 Said, \"There lays your wife. Your babies will be there pretty soon. Your daddy is buried. Your brother is buried. And your wife is going to be buried now, tomorrow. And here is your other baby, dying. He's a good God? Huh? He's a healer?\" Said, \"You made a sap out of yourself!\"\n\nL-192 What did it do? From... it was working from the outside, now, to this first man.\n\nL-193 Said, \"Now look. You know, when you was a few years ago, about two or three years ago, before you accepted This, you was well thought of amongst the people. You lived a good, clean life. Any girl in the city, that wanted to go 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min out, go out with you, 'cause they felt clean and decent.\" I could stand before any of them. I never insulted one, never said anything. She even act smart, I'd take her home. \"And you were liked amongst the people. But what are you now? A religious fanatic.\"\n\nL-194 \"That's right. I was.\" See these things begin to move together? The outside, reasoning in the spirit, moving these things together. \"That's right, Satan.\" \"And did you say He was a healer?\" \"Yes. Hum. Yeah.\"\n\nL-195 \"And you begging and crying, and the people telling you it wasn't so, that you're all off the line. Your own church turned you out, for This. Your own Baptist church down there, put you out the door, for the very same cause. \"Yeah.\"\n\nL-196 \"Your daddy buried. Your brother buried. Your wife lying there, to be buried. Here is your baby, just about fifteen minutes longer and it'll be gone. And He's a healer? Your own flesh and blood; one word from Him would save the baby's life. 'He's a healer,' you said. The people tried to tell you. The preacher told you you was all messed up; you was all insane; you was become a religious fanatic. And you said He loved you. Could He love you?\n\nL-197 \"And how you cried for your daddy! How, night after night, you fasted, and when you... in daytime, when you'd have to pray, to get up a pole, to work. And when He let him die in your arms, a sinner.\n\nL-198 \"How your wife, what a fine woman she was, and how you loved her!\"Billy's mother; many of you remember Hope. \"What a fine girl she was! How happy you was, your little home over there; with about seven or eight dollars worth of furniture, what furniture you had, but yet you loved her; and you... and you loved one another. And you went and prayed for others; and, some mental emotion, they got up and walked away and said they were all right. But now your own wife; and there she is, dead, second day now, lying in the undertaker's establishment down yonder, Scott and Combs. He's a healer? Huh?\n\nL-199 \"And your little boy at the point of death, Billy Paul, eighteen months old. And your little girl, at eight months old, is lying here, dying, with meningitis. And you just prayed; and God pulled a sheet down, said, 'Shut up!' Don't hear, won't hear you, at all! Turned His back on you. He's a good God? Huh? He loves you? And every girl you ever went with, every boy you ever associated with, your very best friends, has walked away from you as a religious fanatic.\"\n\nL-200 Everything he was telling me was the truth. Everything that he would say, just fall right in line, see, here. I was just then about ready to say, \"Then I, if that's the way He has to act, then I won't serve Him.\"\n\nL-201 Just as I said that, there was Something came from somewhere else, way down on the inside. Said, \"Who are you, to begin with? The Lord gave, and the Lord taken away.\" See, that's that inside man, don't reason at all.\n\nL-202 I looked back, and I thought, \"How did I get on earth? I come from a bunch of drunkards. How did I get here? Who give me life? Who give me that wife? Who give me that baby? Where did my wife come from? Where did my life come from?\" I said, \"Though He slay me, yet I'll trust Him.\" I said, \"Get away from me, Satan!\" [Job 1:21], [Job 13:15]\n\nL-203 I laid my hand over on the baby. I said, \"Sharon, honey, I'll lay you on your mother's arms in a few minutes, when the Angels of God comes to take you away, but one day daddy will see you again. I don't know how it's going to be, honey. I can't tell you how; when He turns His back upon me, won't even hear for you.\"\n\nL-204 He let my wife die, and me holding her by the hands, crying for her. And my daddy, in his arms, died on this arm right here; looking up at me, trying to get his breath. And I prayed as hard as I could. How could I face the public again, to preach Divine healing? How could I preach He was a good God, and let my own daddy die, a sinner? How could I preach that? I don't know how, but I know He's right.\n\nL-205 The Word of God shall never fail. It'll triumph, no matter what that is. Then I knowed there was Something inside of all reasonings, Something inside of all emotions, everything else like that. There was a inside Man that held in that hour. Nothing else could a-done it; every reason, everything could be showed, everything could prove that It was 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min wrong, and I was in the wrong. But the Word of God, that was predestinated before the foundation of the world, held on the inside.\n\nL-206 I felt a little Wind come through the building. Her spirit went to meet God.\n\nL-207 Brother, sister, let me tell you, That's the only thing. Don't try to reason It out. Don't try to have long hair because I said so. Don't try to do these things just, because, in your flesh. Don't try to do it, just kind of cope up. But just wait before the Lord, till Something way down on the inside!\n\nL-208 Many of you think, 'cause you've got long hair, that means you're going to go to Heaven. That doesn't mean that. Many of them thinks, 'cause you're a good, moral woman, you're going to...?... It don't mean that. Many of them think, because their churches, and belong to this, and this great groups, and great doctors of Divinity. That don't mean that. See?\n\nL-209 Many think, because they speak with tongues, they've got the Holy Ghost. That don't mean that. Though, the Holy Ghost does speak with tongues. But until that real, genuine Holy Spirit in there will cope with every Word! If that Holy Spirit in you, that makes you speak with tongues, looks back there and doesn't agree with the rest of the Word, then it's the wrong spirit. See?\n\nL-210 It's got to come from the inside, which is the Word, from the beginning. \"In the beginning of the creation of God,\" when God begin to create, bring you into existence, you see. You started back there as a seed, and worked down to where you are now. And, then, you were all in Christ. And then when Christ died, He died to redeem all of you. And you are a part of this Word, and how can... the Bible, all of It! \"Precept upon precept, line upon line; here a little, there a little.\" \"Not one jot or a tittle shall fail.\" How in the world can you, being part of that Word, disagree with the rest of It, or any part of It? [Isaiah 28:10, 13]\n\nL-211 God bless you. I'm overtime now. I didn't mean to do this, keep you that long. Sorry that I kept you; not sorry for what I said. We're right at the end of something, friends.\n\nL-212 All of you here, I guess, are just the members here of the church. I don't get around, in time, to see what members there is. I imagine all of you are constant comers here. Let me tell you something that happened. Will you spare, say, six more minutes? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-213 Is that Rev. Mr. O. Walker here from Oregon, that was here that--that Sunday I was here? Anybody know about? Was great, strange thing.\n\nL-214 I come down here, there was so many people in, I--I had... I had a pile of interviews, and every one of them worthy; their boy, children, married, drunkards, and--and different things, and just things that was worthy. Every one of them should have been seen. I can't do all that. And I commit you to God, and hold my hands over them, in prayer. I said, \"O God, I--I couldn't do it. Get to them, Lord, do... You know how to do it. I pray for each one.\"\n\nL-215 Billy called me. And I just come in with Brother Banks. He said, \"Daddy, if you...\"\n\nL-216 And, look, I see people drive out there sometime, in the lane, look in. And I look out at them, then wave at them like that, and they--they almost turn their head. I don't want you to do that.\n\nL-217 The other day when they was buying that place out there at Tucson for me to live in, Brother Tony had a place up there he wanted to buy me, for about three or four times what this place cost. He even wanted to put in so many thousand dollars on it, himself. But the only way you get in there, a gateman was standing out there. A great big... Well, it's a addition up there. But any... This people that lives there, you have to have a written permission, then this gateman calls you and see if it's all right for them to come in.\n\nL-218 I said, \"Could you imagine, me, my brothers and sisters who come to see me, that wants to shake my hand and ask God's blessings for me, could you imagine me put myself in there, Tony?\" He said, \"Well, you have...\"\n\nL-219 I said, \"Tony, the way the church and all of them has the people not to come around,\" I said, \"that's for people 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min that's got everything they want me to do.\"\n\nL-220 They, they say, \"Well, the Lord told me. Hallelujah! I'm going to stay right here. Glory to God! The Lord told me you have to hold a meeting over here in our group. Yes, sir, glory to God! The God told me that. If you don't do it, Brother Branham, you're sure backslid.\" Me in there trying to study, see. That's what, see. And many a good person gets beat out, of coming in, because of that.\n\nL-221 Just like a man going hunting out here on a farm. A farmer say, \"Come on in. You can hunt.\"And you get out there and shoot one of his cows; a rabbit run under the cow, and just shoot the rabbit, anyhow. You get up on the fence, instead of going to the post and climb over like a decent man should do; climb up on the fence and break it down like that. See? And then he'll say, \"I'll post the place!\" I don't--I don't blame him one bit, not one bit. Well, what does he do? He keeps the decent hunter from coming in. It's always that way. It's the evil that keeps the good from having the preeminences. It's always.\n\nL-222 Now, but them people are, thousands are really needy and nice people, loving people, full of God's grace.\n\nL-223 Now we have this, how these people come like that. We don't, we don't want that, no. But this man come...\n\nL-224 Billy said, \"Run down now, right quick, daddy.\" Said, \"Mrs. Waldorf is down here with some people dying; must see them right at once.\" And I run in; come down here.\n\nL-225 And coming back, they said, \"There is nobody down here but a man sleeping on a side of the side, out there, on a pillow every day, on the side of the building.\" Said, \"He wants you to pray for him.\" I said, \"All right.\" Said, \"I'll put him in.\" I came in.\n\nL-226 There was, I think, a Cadillac sitting back here in the back, or some kind of big car. I rode in, was... And that man said, \"How do you do.\" He didn't know me.\n\nL-227 And I walked in. And Sister Waldorf, poor old thing, came in. You know, she was...\n\nL-228 You know her case, don't you? See, she had cancer; died in the prayer line, about an hour before I got to her. Her doctor come, showed... That's been about eighteen years ago, cancer in the heart, see, and she is living today. And she's living down in Arkansas now.\n\nL-229 And she was in Phoenix, then. And she said, \"Brother Willie, I hated to come in like this, but,\" said, \"I didn't have no place to stay. They did... They said this pa-... this woman is going to die. Oh, Brother Willie!\"\n\nL-230 Said, \"I wanted to bring you a little offering in my hand, Brother Willie,\" said, \"but I couldn't do it. But I canned some blackberry jelly.\"\n\nL-231 Oh, when I went up there and seen them little glasses of jelly she had sitting there, I... it looked too sacred for me to eat. See? That dear little old woman, about seventy years old. I said, \"Sister Hattie...\" I--I couldn't say no. No. Jesus seen that widow putting in three pennies, and He--He--He let her alone. See? No. God will reward her for it. Yeah.\n\nL-232 And so the Lord healed the woman, healed all she had, revealed to her pastor what he, she, had on his mind, what he's supposed to do, another thing. And, oh, they all went out, shouting.\n\nL-233 Then Billy run in. He said, \"Daddy, that man is gone. I can't...\" I said, \"Who is that out there in the car?\"\n\nL-234 \"Oh,\" he said, \"some guy came down from Oregon, said he's got some kind of a dream. And I told him, 'I wouldn't give you no false hope. There's three hundred here, waiting now.'\" And said, \"And I told him, 'Just write the dream out.' Said, 'I got a pile of them in here, that high, anyhow, and I just add it to it.'\" I said, \"Bring him in. Give him five minutes.\"\n\nL-235 Well, as soon as the man walked in, five minutes? He said, \"I am Rev. Walker,\" I think his name was, \"from Oregon.\" I think he's a some other denomination, I don't know, Presbyterian, Presbyterian something.\n\nL-236 He said, \"I met you about twenty years ago. I come down to Grants Pass where you...\" Or, not Grants Pass, but I 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min forget the name of the place. \"There,\" said, \"whole country, headlines in the paper every morning.\" Said, \"Everybody knew about it.\" Said, \"I couldn't even get to the building where you was at, but I seen you go up. And one day, on the street, I walked up,\" said, \"four or five man around you, and I shook your hand. And you... I told you I was Brother Walker, and you told me who you was.\" Said, \"We passed a couple words, and then three or four big man with you just pushed you on.\" He said, \"I wasn't your critic, and I wasn't for you.\" He said, \"I just didn't understand.\"\n\nL-237 He said, \"It went on that way for a few years, and after while,\" said, \"I... a man told me to come listen to some tapes, about three years ago.\" And said, \"The man played the tapes. And, when he did,\" he said, \"I heard him talk.\" And said, \"This man believed that you was a--a prophet. I said, I told the man, 'I don't know about those things; might be, for all I know.'\"\n\nL-238 So, said, \"Then another man moved into our town, had a meeting, and I met him. And he said, 'I'm God's prophet for this day.'\"\n\nL-239 He said, \"'How many of you guys are there, anyhow?' Said, 'I--I--I hear where a man down here is listening to tapes, said, \"William Branham, back in the east, was a prophet of the day,\" and things like that.'\"\n\nL-240 He said, \"This man...\" I ain't going to call his name, 'cause it don't sound right, here, you see. \"And he said, 'I know William Branham,' said, 'but he's all false in his Doctrine.' Said, 'He isn't Pentecostal; he doesn't believe in initial evidence.' And said, 'Another thing, he says there is major and minor prophets. There is no such a thing.' Said, 'You're a prophet or not a prophet, and that's all.'\"\n\nL-241 He said, \"'Well, mister, I'm... didn't argue with you about it. I just said I heard this man say that this man, William Branham... and that this man claimed that he was a prophet.'\" Said, \"'I just wondered how many there was.'\"\n\nL-242 \"He said, 'But I want you to know this. I'm the prophet of this age.'\"\n\nL-243 He said, \"'Well, you are?'\" Said, \"'The Lord bless you and be with you.'\"\n\nL-244 He went on, never paid any attention to it. And said he started on, amongst his brethren, a series of three or four meetings. And he went down to the post office, said, \"Don't--don't change my mail. Leave it here till I come back, about four or five days later.\"\n\nL-245 \"All right,\" they said. They put a ticket up there, not to change it. He went down and seen his daughter.\n\nL-246 And on the road out, he--he stopped at a church. And he had that night's meeting. The next morning, he said he just happened to think, \"Go get general delivery.\" And when he did, one letter had creeped through the post office and got to his daughter; his daughter sent there, general delivery.\n\nL-247 And he opened it up. And said it was a man, Mr. Hildebrandt, which is a friend of mine, that had been the man playing the tapes. Said Mr. Hildebrandt had a word from Roy Borders (and that's one of the managers, you know), that I was going to hold a meeting back here, for from the twenty-eighth through the first, come back and see for himself.\n\nL-248 He said, \"Now, looky here, them guys trying to pull me in something like that!\" See? And he just flipped the letter over in the wastebasket, and went on, see, like that. Went on in and held that meeting that night. And the next morning...\n\nL-249 Then he started holding his heart, to crying, right there in the room.\n\nL-250 He said, \"Mr. Branham, I realize I got to stand before God.\" He said, \"I don't know whether I was asleep or what happened.\" He said, \"I dreamed. I'm going to say I was asleep and I dreamed.\"\n\nL-251 Said, \"I thought my son, in the market, stuck his hand in a--a sack.\" And said, \"When he did, it was a sack of apples, and they all turned over.\" Said, \"When I went to pick them up, they was all green apples with one bite taken out of them.\" Said, \"I was picking them up, put them back in the sack.\" Said, \"Some of them rolled out, and rolled down, so I went to try to get them, and under... on the grass.\" And said, \"They rolled under one of these chain-lock fences. And there was a big super highway run in there. I looked back east, and,\" he said, \"the--the--the chain was hooked against a--a big rock back in the east. And I went back there, and thought I'd let this chain down, then go over and get 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min the apples for the man.\" Said, \"I started to let the chain down.\"\n\nL-252 Said, \"A voice shook the whole earth.\" Said, \"The earth shook, from under my feet.\" And said, \"After it quit shaking, I heard a voice.\" And said, \"Brother Branham, it was your voice,\" said, \"I knowed; there was something said that.\" Said--said, \"It said, 'I'll ride this trail once more!'\"\n\nL-253 And said, \"I started looking up the rock, like this, and looked on, in a past the clouds. And way up there, standing on a rock that reached from the east to the west, in a pointed shape like that, like a pyramid, run back here to the east, and,\" said, \"there you were standing there, on a horse that I never seen anything like it in my life; great white horse, white mane hanging down.\" And said, \"You was dressed like an Indian chief, with all the things the Indians use.\" Said, \"He had a breastplate; them bangles on the arms, and all down around like that.\" Said, \"You had your hands up like that.\" And said, \"That horse standing there like a military horse, with a prance like this, walking,\" me standing still. And said, \"You pulled on the reins, went riding off towards the west.\"\n\nL-254 Said, \"I looked down there, and there was a whole lot of scientists.\" And the next morning... That was Saturday. On the next morning, I preached on scientists, you know, being of the devil. And said, \"Scientists there were pouring things in tubes, and mixing it.\" Said, \"You stopped the horse, raised up your hands again and screamed, 'I'll ride this trail once more!'\" And said, \"The whole earth shook. Them people shook,\" said, \"looked up and looked at one another, like that, and looked up to you. They just shrugged their shoulders, went on with their scientific research.\" And said, \"You started going on towards the west.\n\nL-255 \"And when it did,\" said, \"I seen this man that called himself a prophet, you know,\" said, \"he come up on a horse that was mixed with white and black together.\" And said, \"He got up behind this great big horse.\" Said, \"It was,\" said, \"way up above the clouds, and the road wasn't over about that wide.\" And said, \"That horse just danced, to the wind blowing the feathers and everything on--on your garb,\" and said, \"then the horse mane and tail blowing. Great master, big white horse, walking right in line.\" And said--and said, \"This guy ran up behind you, come from towards Canada,\" and the man lives in Canada. And he said, \"Come back, and,\" said, \"he took his little horse, trying to knock your big horse off; turning him around; make his hips hit against the...\" Said, \"It never moved the big horse; he just kept walking.\"\n\nL-256 Said, \"Then, all of a sudden,\" said, \"you turned around.\" Said, \"That would be the third time you had spoke, but the second time you said 'I'll ride.'\" And said, \"You didn't speak like you did. You commanded.\" Said, \"You turned around and called the man by name, and said, 'Get off of here! You know that no man can ride this road here without God be ordaining him to do it. Get off of here!'\"\n\nL-257 And said, \"The man turned around.\" And said, \"The man has wrote me letters.\" And said, \"Across his horse's hips,\" that black and gray, and mixed up together, said, \"across his horse's hips was wrote his name, signature just exactly like is on his letter. And he rode off towards the north.\"\n\nL-258 Said, \"Then you went on down; that big horse turned around, way as far west as you could.\" Said, \"You stood and raised your hands up like that.\" Then he started crying. Said, \"Brother Branham, to see that horse standing there; all that war bonnet and everything like that, and,\" said, \"that breastplate and everything shine.\" Said, \"You held your hands up a little while.\" And said, \"You looked down again, picked up the reins, said, 'I'll ride this trail just once more!'\" Said, \"The whole earth shook back and forth, like that.\" And said, \"There was no more life left in me; I just fell down aside of the rock. Then I woke up.\" Said, \"What does it mean, sir?\" I said, \"I don't know.\"\n\nL-259 Next morning... Junior Jackson, who dreamed about the pyramid, you know, when I went out west. You remember that? He called me, a month or two before that. He had a dream that's burning; he had to tell me. And I said, \"Billy...\"\n\nL-260 There was about twenty standing out there. He said, \"Junior Jackson, down there, said he had to tell you that dream.\" 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min I said, \"Send him in, just about five minutes.\"\n\nL-261 He brought his wife in, and, he said, for a witness. He said, \"I dreamed, Brother Branham, me and my wife was out riding.\" And said, \"I looked back in the east, and I saw, look like, a spot, like one of them flying saucers.\"\n\nL-262 See, the world don't know what that is, you know. You know it's on. We know what it is. See? We know it's investigating, judgment Angels, you see. And how at the Pentagon and all, about how it comes right down; and the intelligence, how they can [Brother Branham snaps his fingers once--Ed.] go like a flash and be gone, pull away from anything they got. See, they don't realize what it is, see. Let them think whatever they want to. They call it flying saucers, or whatever. They don't know, see.\n\nL-263 Said, \"And I seen it coming, and I watched it. And what it was, it was a man on a horse.\" And said, \"He was coming with lightning speed.\" Said, \"I seen he was going to come down in front of me. And I stopped my car, jumped out. When it did,\" said, \"the car... horse was standing in the road, a great white military horse walking in a prance.\" That's the Word, of course, you know, walking in a prance.\n\nL-264 Said, \"There was a man sitting on there.\" Said, \"He--he was dressed in western garb; wasn't a cowboy, but,\" said, \"looked like a chief over rangers or something.\" See, all of his chief authority, from the west; the Indians over the Indians; rangers over, see. And said, \"The man had his hat pulled down, and had... was looking sideways.\" And said, \"When he turned sideways,\" said, \"it was you, Brother Branham.\" Said, \"You never talked like you did. You said, 'Junior!' Called him three times. And said, 'I'll tell you what to do.'\" And said, \"Then you pulled up on the reins of this horse. You made about three lopes, and took to the skies, and you were gone towards the west.\"\n\nL-265 He said, \"Just a minute, I looked around, and here came a horse smaller than that one, of the same breed, but smaller, and stood.\" Said, \"I walked around, said, 'He must have sent this back for me.'\" Said, \"I got in it.\" (Junior has done a little riding, too. He said, \"You know how your saddle fits you, Brother Branham, the stirrups and everything?\") Said, \"I thought, 'Well, this fits me just right.' So I pulled up on the reins, off through the skies.\" Said, \"I pulled on the reins and stopped him, turned him around and went back. See? When I went back,\" said, \"I stopped the horse, got off, talked to the wife. The horse was gone.\" And he woke up.\n\nL-266 Then, day before yesterday, three days ago, come Leo Mercier, coming down with exactly the same dream, not knowing nothing about it; about trying to breed a big white stallion to a black mare, and they couldn't do it; nervous. Said I walked up there, said, \"'Leo,'\" and told him what I did. I don't want to say it here, see, but I told him what I did. \"Said, 'Don't you see? Now, to know this; I didn't know Ed Dalton had a son-in-law, and the son-in-law had a dog by this name. You'll know, Leo, that you're dreaming. But, when you wake up, remember it!'\" And said, \"I never heard such a command.\"\n\nL-267 About that time, Roy Roberson come in, said, \"Brother Branham, you remember back there before you left the church the first time? We was... I seen you sitting, like in Palestine. We was all, the board and everything, was sitting like the Lord's supper table, and then you talked. And you... He wasn't sure what you was talking about.\" Said, \"A white cloud come down and got you, packed you away.\" How many remembers the--the dream of Brother Roy? And said, \"The white cloud packed you away,\" and said, \"then you was gone. I walked through the streets, screaming and crying.\"\n\nL-268 When I come up out here, and that little old arm crippled up, like he was, a reading this. He dropped the rake and started crying when he seen me coming up out there. I hadn't seen him so he tell me the dream. And he said... And he was raking. I said...\n\nL-269 \"And--and you went away.\" Said, \"I walked the streets, everywhere, trying to find you. I couldn't find you, nowhere. I was screaming, 'Oh, Brother Branham, don't leave!'\" Said, \"A white cloud come in and got you, and packed you away from us, towards the west.\" That was before the pyramid or anything. Said, \"Packed you towards the west. And I cried, and I walked the streets.\"\n\nL-270 Said, \"After a while I went and sat at the table. I happened to look up there at the head of the table.\" Said, \"I could just see that much of you, was snow white.\" Said, \"You was standing there.\" And said, \"You spoke with authority. 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min There was no guessing to it.\" Said, \"Every man understood exactly what you said.\"\n\nL-271 Oh, my brother, sister, now, every one of you conscious, I know what that means. See?\n\nL-272 Just watch! Stay close to Christ. Let me warn you now, as a minister of the Gospel, of this. Don't take any foolishness. Don't imagine anything. Stay right there until this inside of the inside is anchored to the Word, that you're right in Christ, 'cause that's the only thing that's going to... Cause, we're in the most deceiving age that we ever lived in. \"It would deceive the very Elected if it was possible,\" because they have anointing, they can do anything like the rest of them. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-273 Clean your lives up. Pay your debts. \"Owe no man,\" Jesus said. Now, now, I mean, like your house rent and stuff, you got to do it. Get all your things off your hands. Get everything right. Make ready. Get ready. Remember, in the Name of the Lord, something is fixing to happen. [Romans 13:8]\n\nL-274 I'm going into the hills this week, not exactly to hunt squirrels; course, I like to hunt squirrels. But I'm going out there for this purpose, saying, \"O God, I don't know which way to move, and I don't want to miss this. Help me.\"\n\nL-275 You pray for me. Will you do it? I'll be praying for you. I hope, by the mercies of God, that I meet every one of you, and we meet in a better Land than this here.\n\nL-276 And what are we coming here for? What are we doing? Are we coming here, playing a game? Are we coming here, meeting as a lodge? It's, Christ can't come until that Church is perfectly right. He is waiting on us. I believe we're at the end.\n\nL-277 Look at, in California. Look at the riots. Look at nineteen people being killed, racial. Didn't I tell you, here not long ago, that that Martin Luther King would lead his people to a massacre? How many remembers that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] It isn't them colored people; it's them leaders stirring them up. It isn't integration, segregations, and whatever they want to call it; it's the devil. That's right. Not only to the white, colored; this is all of them. It's the devil.\n\nL-278 The mental faculties and reasons of man is broke down. There is no hopes. It's beyond hope. The whole thing is a putrid-ated sore. The mental faculties of man; they can't make decisions.\n\nL-279 I'm not a politician. I don't, neither Democrat or Republican. They're all filthy. I'm for one Kingdom, and that's the Kingdom of Jesus Christ. That's all. But how in the world did you ever see a bunch of puppets like we got up there now, like that bunch of Texans we got in there? \"Why,\" they say, \"whatever the people wants! If they want communism, we'll give them communism. If they want integration, we'll give them integration. Want segregation, we give whatever.\" Did it... Where is man?\n\nL-280 O God! That's like the pulpit. Where is man, man that's man, that stands for a principle? Where is women that stands for a principle? Where is a church that stands for a principle? I ain't got a nickel's worth of time for a wishy-washy, give in, compromising spirit. A woman is a woman, let her be lady. If a man is a man, let him be man.\n\nL-281 If he's a president... Where is our John Quincy Adamses? Where is our Abraham Lincolns, man of principle? Where is our Patrick Henry, said, \"Give me liberty or give me death\"?\n\nL-282 Where is a man that stands for what's right? Where is the man that's not afraid to speak out? Regardless, the whole world's against him, speak out for what's right; and stand for it and die for it. Where is our Arnold von Winkelried again today? Where is men of integrity? Where is men with spirit? They're so wishy-washy and gaumed up until they don't know where they stand.\n\nL-283 God, let me stand with the principles of one Man, as a minister, the Word of Jesus Christ. \"For heavens and earth will pass away, but It'll never fail. On this Rock I'll build My Church; the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\" Let us stand. Blest be the tie that binds Our hearts in Christian love; The fellowship of kindred mind 65-0815, And Knoweth It Not, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 107 min Is like to that Above. Now join your hands with one another. When we asunder part, It gives us inward pain; But we shall still be joined in heart, And hope to meet again. Till we meet! till we meet! Till we meet at Jesus, feet; Till we meet! till we meet! God be with you till we meet again! [Matthew 24:35], [Matthew 16:18]\n\nL-284 Let's bow our heads now, while Brother Neville dismiss us, in a word of prayer. Be back tonight, now. We're expecting a great service tonight, here at the tabernacle. God bless you. And pray for me; I'll pray for you.\n\nL-285 Don't think that I'm a fanatic, friends. Don't think I'm trying to push something on you. I love you. And I have a principle, that's the Bible. Not one Word can be taken from It. Not one word can be added to It. And I believe It the way It's written. [Revelation 22:18]\n\nL-286 Let's bow our heads now, and our loyal, good pastor dismiss the congregation. God bless you, Brother Neville.

Seen you brought a brother. Lord bless you. \"All things are possible, only believe.\" Let us pray. O God, truly that's what our heart's desire is tonight, just only to believe. As we've assembled here tonight in the tabernacle, the sun setting in the west, we pray, dear God, that You'll let us realize how close it is that the sun is setting also upon time; it's running out. The day is far spent. And we remember one time when the day was far spent, two travelers bid You come in and stay with them. And then You made Yourself known to them by explaining Your Word and letting them see that what Christ must suffer, all these things first.\n\nL-2 So we pray, God, as the day is far spent, that You'll come into our houses and live with us, and explain to us the Word, Lord, that we so graciously hold as a treasure from You, as a gift in our heart. May we never overstep It; may we always reverence It with all of our hearts.\n\nL-3 We thank You for what You did for those in the hospital this morning, and what You did for Brother Capps' little boy that was laying, almost dying, and now here he is in the audience tonight. How we thank You, Father, for all these things!\n\nL-4 Grant, Lord, that we may know how that we should give You praise. We just... It's beyond our understanding to know how to give You praise. But, Lord, receive our hearts as thanksgiving tokens, that we love You. And when we--we want to do what's right, show us what to do. We ask in Jesus' Name. Amen. You may be seated.\n\nL-5 Good evening to this great packed church tonight and out across the land on the telephones. They say they're hooked up again tonight. I hope my wife is listening in. I didn't get to call her, so I'm going to call her after this service.\n\nL-6 And we have a note here that this morning Brother Jackson's bro-... or father being in such a condition, that such an improvement's taken place, he may get to come home tomorrow.\n\nL-7 Brother Capps' little boy, who he called me the other night, I don't know whether Brother Capps in the audience or not, but, and his little boy was very sick. And just happened to be that Joseph and I was down to the--the shooting range, getting my little twenty-two rifle ready. I told you all about it last week. And he really going to be a real shot. And so he wanted be sure and tell Gary and Larry what he did. And he told me, coming back... I said, \"You ought to stop in and--and tell Brother Gene Norman about it.\" He said, \"Stop and tell Billy first,\" his brother. After he showed him what good shots he made, he said, \"Now keep off of my feet.\" See?\n\nL-8 And just as we got there, why, the phone rang, and Billy run in to ask... I said, \"It may be a sick call now.\" And we just got in, and it was Brother Capps. And the little boy had peritonitis, and just a very little shade of a chance to live. And the Lord has healed him. And the other night said he's suffering with some kind of pains, Mrs. Woods was telling me. And we was leaving in a hurry, and I just... I said, \"Mrs. Woods, it's so late now, ten o'clock, I doubt of them letting me in out there at the hospital.\" I said, \"I'm going up home and just close the door.\" And I went up and prayed. And they say the little boy is in the audience tonight. So we're very thankful for that. And we're grateful.\n\nL-9 Now we're holding on; we haven't heard yet. If Brother Leo Mercier and Sister Mercier is listening in, we haven't heard as yet from your father. We hope to hear in a little while, how he's doing. But I'm almost sure he'll be all right, so we're trusting that to Almighty God, that God will take care of that dear, old sainted man, an old veteran minister of the Gospel.\n\nL-10 Now, oh, there is so many things that needs to be done, and such a short time to do it, so just put all of our efforts 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min now in what we can do for our Lord.\n\nL-11 I come down a little bit early. And I--I haven't been feeling too extra good. I got tired, just really tired, and I laid down this afternoon. Never... I haven't even eat dinner yet. So I--I went in, just laid down all afternoon. I felt bad, so laid there. And then got to praying, and I felt better. And got up, put on my clothes, and come to church.\n\nL-12 So we--we are trusting to the Lord Jesus now that He will bless our efforts together tonight, as across the nation we try to join this part of the Body of Christ, that I have been given the right to feed His sheep. And I would only do the very best of my knowledge, in giving out the right Food that I know for the sheep. And I'm anxiously waiting for the hour to where we can all congregate in one place and preach on those Seven Plagues, and Seven Vials, and the Trumpets, and so forth. They all happen right in a cluster. That's the reason it'll take us about a week, ten days or more, to get through it in one single meeting, if we can. Think it's very sufficient. [John 21:17]\n\nL-13 Now, many of you are traveling far. I look out here, and I just noticed, a while ago, the folks in Tucson. Mrs. Sothmann, I see Brother Fred arrived all right. I seen him in the audience this morning. And there I think that's Brother Don Ruddell setting there by him back there, tonight. Glad to see Brother Don in. And Junior, is Junior here, or is he at his church? I guess they're in on the phones at the church tonight. So, all you brethren, we're very happy that you're here with us tonight, and trusting in the Lord that someday we, when the life's day is finished and our little light of mortal life begins to grow dim and going out, we'll fear no evil, for down through the--the...\n\nL-14 I just got a report to you, up in--up at... in Arizona, up at Prescott. Brother Coggins has been dismissed from the hospital. So we're very thankful for that. Good. That's fine. So we're very grateful for that. Sister Mercier, your daddy is getting all right now. I just felt, after we prayed, that he would be all right. So they may be tuned in; I hope they are; and I think they are. So we very grateful for that, that our brother is--is all right now, and going be all right. So we thank the Lord for all these things.\n\nL-15 Had a request last night; a dear brother here, I guess he may not be with us today. A brother from down in Kentucky, called me about his daughter. Lovely family, and the--the girl is going to be operated, a young mother with cancer in the back. So we--we pray that God will deliver this young woman. I believe He will, if we'll just... The congregation, all of us together, join in and pray for these people, all together. That's what we must do, as a unit. As...\n\nL-16 And as the days grow closer and closer, and the narrowing of the path, we--we want to go closer together. My, we must be just one, one body. We must move together, forgetting one another's sins and our differences, just sticking closer and closer and closer, as we see that Day approaching. Assembling ourselves together, all with one accord and one heart. And if a brother, sister gets out of the way, in any way, don't do nothing but pray for that person, and in love, always considering one another. Don't--don't never let one of you get away. Stay together. And, if you can, add more to it, constantly, all the time. [Ephesians 4:1-4]\n\nL-17 Brother Neville, I got your request here concerning Brother Wright, Brother George Wright setting here. We're glad Brother Wright and Sister Wright, here... Little Edith, I... One day when we come, we want to have a little memorial service here. I didn't get back for Edith and when she went. But, Sister Wright, you remember the dream she had about a couple years ago. And I told you then, I said, \"It's, little Edith won't stay with us very long now,\" because the Lord had already told that she was going, through that dream that she had. And I got the interpretation of it, was, that she was going to meet God. About two years later, she went to meet God. Now waiting for her papa and mama to cross the dividing line, between mortal and immortality.\n\nL-18 God bless you. I want to try to see you right away, if I just possibly can. So God be with you and Shelby, and everybody. I thought I seen Shelby this morning; I wasn't sure. You can't see too good up here; ceiling is down like this, and it casts a--a light like that. You can see the spots, but you can't see the people too well. 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min\n\nL-19 Now right straight to the Message. This is a Message I want to read from Numbers 19:9 and Ephesians 5:26. And if you people who keep down the records of the text, and so forth, why, you may jot it down. [Numbers 19:9], [Ephesians 5:26]\n\nL-20 And now remember, if this is being taped... I don't know. I can't see anyone. Yes, I do, I do see Brother Terry over in--in the recording room. And if this is being taped; to any ministers at any place, any time, this is not directed in disregards to your teachings, this is not even directed to your sheep. This Message, and all other of the Messages that I speak on, is directed to my congregation. It's not for your congregation unless they want to receive It. But It's directed to this people here.\n\nL-21 The people buy these tapes. The people across the world buy them and play them. Many times they write in. And I always refer to them, if they're a member of some church, \"See your pastor.\"\n\nL-22 Now, pastor, I want you to know that, that, this is only to my congregation I speak these things. And I have a right to do that, because I been set by the Holy Spirit to watch over these sheep. And woe unto me if I don't tell them what I think is the Truth, and way I think It comes. But It's not for the world or the rest of the churches. You do whatever God tells you to do. I cannot answer for you, neither can you answer for me. But we must each answer before God, for our ministry. Therefore, if I have to answer for my ministry, I must preach It in the way that I see It, in the way It's revealed to me. So let that be known now.\n\nL-23 Now in Numbers 19:9, we want to read this text, or this Scripture, rather. And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and shall lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation... (watch now) for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin. [Numbers 19:9]\n\nL-24 Notice, not to everybody, \"to the congregation of the children of Israel; the waters of separation.\" Now in Ephesians, the 5th chapter, and beginning with the 22nd verse. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is in subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; Now here is what I want to say now. That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word, [Ephesians 5:22-26]\n\nL-25 Now, this little text tonight, if I should call it a text. And I trust that people here, and also out in the telephone hookups, will not disregard this and think that it's meant in a way of sacrilegious. Though, to take a text like this, it would sound sacrilegious. The subject that I'm using for tonight is: A Thinking Man's Filter. That sounds very radical for a subject, for a minister that's so opposed to smoking, would take a text like that, A Thinking Man's Filter. It come to pass, that, the other morning when I had went squirrel hunting.\n\nL-26 If you people out on the--out on the radio, the air, or on the telephone wave, could have seen the expression on this congregation's face when I announced my text, you'd a-had a laugh out of it. A Thinking Man's Filter.\n\nL-27 Well, it all happened up where the Angels of the Lord appeared to me one morning, and them squirrels was spoke into existence. All of you remembers when it taken place. And, also, just at the top the hill where I was standing, was where... just before preaching the Seven Church Ages, going hunting one morning before daylight. There stood... I thought the sun was coming up, about four o'clock in the morning. Unusual; I seen that Light, and I turned around, and there stood the Seven Golden Candlesticks standing up there on top of the hill, with like a rainbow was coming up 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min through the pipes and feeding out.\n\nL-28 Immediately after that, the Lord Jesus appeared to us. And right then I heard a Voice that said, \"The Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New.\" And there He was, after a while, revealed after those Seven Golden Candlesticks. Then notice that. How many remembers that text? I wrote it on the back of a--of a box of--of cartridges I had in my pocket. \"Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New.\" God in Heaven knows that that was true.\n\nL-29 When I crossed that place where He had appeared to me a little later on, about the squirrels.\n\nL-30 Then when I called my good friend, Jack Moore, a few months later, to ask; when I started to preach the Seven Church Ages, Revelations 1. And He was standing, white all over; His hair was like wool. How could He, being yet thirty-three years old, and be white all over? And Brother Moore, a very fine, cultured, Christian gentleman, and a scholar, one of the best that I know of; and he said, \"Brother Branham, that was Jesus after His glorified condition. That's the way He looks now.\" But that didn't ring a bell with me. And I kept praying until one day...\n\nL-31 Before I started the Seven Church Ages, I couldn't get that 1st chapter straightened out right. How could a Man, thirty-three years old, resurrected in the same body that apostles recognized Him, knowed Him to be; and how could He be way up, maybe an eighty or ninety years old, with great white wool over His face, and His beard white as snow?\n\nL-32 I had read over in the Book of the... of Daniel, where he came to \"the Ancient of Days, Whose hair was as white as wool.\" Then I seen that Ancient of Days. He was that Ancient of Days, the same yesterday, today, and forever. See, it was a symbol, then. Why the white wool? And then I... The Holy Spirit seemed to speak to me about a picture I saw one time, of an ancient judge. Then I went to the history; I went back into the Bible history and all, to find out. And the old judges, like the high priest in Israel, he had to have that white, gray woolly-like hair and beard, because the white over him signified that he was supreme authority of the judges in Israel. And even in today, and down to a few hundred years ago, maybe a couple hundred years ago, or maybe not like that, later than that. All the English judges, no matter how young they was or how old they was, when they went in for judgment, they wore a white wig; and to show that there's no other authority, in that kingdom, above their word. Their word is the ultimate of the kingdom. What they say, that's all of it. [Daniel 7:9, 13, 22], [Revelation 1:14]\n\nL-33 And now, then, I seen that. There He was standing there, yet a young Man, but the white wig on. He was the full, supreme Authority. He was the Word. And He's having, wearing the white wig.\n\nL-34 Then, later on when we got through, and the--the sermon, and went out west, and when the Angels of the Lord appeared out there for the Seven Seals, and it went up into the air (which we have the picture of it here, and around over the country), there He was standing there, still wigged with that supreme authority. He is the Head of the Church. He's Head of the Body. There is nothing like Him, anywhere. \"He made all things by Himself. He made all things for Himself, and without He there wasn't nothing made.\" \"He has all authority in Heavens and earth,\" and everything belongs to Him. \"And in Him dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily.\" \"And the Word was God, and made flesh among us.\" And He was the One Who revealed the entire secret of the whole plan of salvation, that all the prophets and wise men had spoke of. He alone was that wigged One and supreme authority. [Ephesians 5:23], [John 1:3], [Matthew 28:18], [Colossians 2:9], [John 1:14]\n\nL-35 Now, I had stopped, up on the hill the other morning, looked like there had been some squirrels been cutting up there. And I started to set down. And I just been there a moment, when, the bushes struck by me, and some great big fellow with a double barrel musket of a thing come walking out through the bushes there, and like scared the daylights out of me. I went on over, scooted down; I was afraid to move, afraid he'd shoot me. And the bushes moving, so I just set real still.\n\nL-36 A squirrel started up over the hill, and he powdered both barrels with him. And so he missed him, and so the squirrel went down over the hill. I thought, \"Now I'll get away, all that noise is echoing. He's got his gun unloaded.\" And I started down the hill, and the guy shot right in front of me. It turned me back this way. And I started over here, to go down another way, and a twenty-two rifle started, and the bullets buzzing above me. I said, \"Say, I'm in an awful 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min place.\"\n\nL-37 So I turned around and went down by the river. And I thought, \"I'll go down here and hide till they get done, so I can get out.\" And on the road down, I happened to draw... My attention was drawn to look over to my right side. And, as I did, there laid a empty cigarette package where one of them had throwed down, in all the running of the... when the squirrels were going through the bushes.\n\nL-38 And I picked up this certain cigarette pack, and was look... I never picked it up; I beg your pardon. I looked down at it. I didn't pick it up, 'cause I don't like the smell of the things, to begin with. And I looked down there, and it's a--a certain tobacco company that I guess I shouldn't call their name, but you'll know. It said on there, \"A thinking man's filter and a smoking man's taste.\" I looked at that thing, and I thought, \"A thinking man's filter?\" I thought, \"If the man could think at all, he wouldn't smoke at all. How could it be 'a thinking man's filter'? A thinking man wouldn't smoke at all.\" All right.\n\nL-39 Now, I thought, \"How deceiving that is!\" Now, that tobacco companies are supposed to be American. And oh, if we live to our policy, we would be working to help one another, if we have a feeling one for the other. And how hypocritical! The reason I never called the company's name, I've got to say some bad things about them. And how hypocritical can anybody be, to make money?\n\nL-40 A thinking man won't smoke at all. But how the American public fall for it; they think that that's wonderful!\n\nL-41 Now look, you cannot, you cannot... Ask anybody, scientists, you'll... you want. You cannot have smoke without having tar. If there's one little speck of smoke comes through, that's tar. And if you don't get any smoke, well, you don't get any tar, and you don't get any anything. You're just drawing against a solid stick. But as long as you get any smoke at all, you're drawing in cancer, nicotine.\n\nL-42 If you had been with me last year, or year before last, I believe it was, at the World's Fair, when Yul Brynner and all of them was up there on demonstrations, and you see them take that cigarette, put it in something, and pull it across a piece of marble. And that doctor taking a swab, rolled across there and got the nicotine off of it, and put it on the back of a white rat, and put him in a cage. And every seven days they took him out. And the rat was so full of cancer he couldn't walk, from the nicotine out of one cigarette.\n\nL-43 Then he said, \"You know, they say that you can get it through a filter.\" He said, \"You cannot have a filter... Any filter that would take nicotine out, takes the smoke out,\" said, \"because you have to have smoke... have tar to make the smoke, and it's the tar that gives the cancer.\"\n\nL-44 And then he went, pulled it through water, and said, \"Sometimes you think you could filter it through.\" Said, \"Every time, that, no matter where you pull it.\" Said, \"They say, 'I don't inhale it,' then put it in their mouth and spit it out.\" Then he took that and rolled it up, and put it under something there, and showed it was still cancer. What are you doing? Swallowing it right down your throat. See? And no matter what you do, it's still death. See?\n\nL-45 And then to think that a company would deceive a man enough, or try to deceive their own people. It's like a vulture living off of their, its own kind. Money-making, selling death to the--the country, and to young men. And go out there on the battle front and die for them, then turn around and sell such a thing as that, under a false pretense, \"A thinking man's filter, but a smoking man's taste.\" You'd have to have the smoke to get the taste. See? \"A smoking man's taste\"?\n\nL-46 How the people fall for it, though! They get it. Now, it's only to deceive you more. See, it's of the devil. They don't care for your life. They ain't got no feeling for you. They sell you that stuff just to watch you die, as long as they get money.\n\nL-47 Like politics and war. I don't believe in war. I don't believe that we all ever should have ever had a war. I believe in the great Kingdom that God is bringing, the great civilization that'll be brought down under His Own great dominion; there will never be another war. Nation won't lift up spears against nations. They'll all be peace, Eternal peace. 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min\n\nL-48 So this kind of a civilization brings war. And more civilized we get, under this, the more war we have. One trying to be more civilized than the other, and the more civilized makes more war. See?\n\nL-49 And look what, under this civilization, that a person would put out such a thing as that. And the only thing it does, it only deceives you to make you buy more cigarettes. For if a man smokes cigarettes... And I believe it is of the devil, and there's a nicotine devil in a man and, or a woman. And if one cigarette will satisfy that nicotine devil till he'll leave you alone and quit haunting you, with one cigarette. And then you take a filter, just lets one-third of that smoke through there then, or one-third of that nicotine through there, then it'll take three cigarettes to take the place of that one, and you'll smoke three to one.\n\nL-50 See, it's only a--a scheme, a deceit, a scheme to try to sell cigarettes. They can sell more that way than they can by just letting a man smoke the straight tobacco in his pipe or in his cigarette. Now, see, it's of the devil.\n\nL-51 As I stood there looking at it, and thinking of how deceitful it was, the question came to me. And I stooped back, looked at the pack again, and I... just seemed like something said to me, \"But the slogan is all right, 'a thinking man's filter, a smoking man's taste.'\" It came to me that that deceitfulness, also, in the natural realm there in the tobacco, is something on a order of the churches of today, see, a deceitfulness.\n\nL-52 It's come till the whole world has become a great deception of what is really true and what's right. See, even in politics, and in social affair, in school, in everything, it becomes a deceitfulness.\n\nL-53 A young fellow was telling me the other day that he was down to an army camp, and a young soldier got run over by a tank; his lungs, his stomach, or whatever it was, punctured. And they went up to the hospital; they had three or four doctors standing there in line, and everybody standing in line. And two or three soldiers holding their buddy up, and him just barely could breathe... Every time he'd breathe, that rib would stick right into his lungs, and that would make him bleeding inwardly. And they let that young man stand there in that line, way back in the back of the line, and let them, some of them guys with nothing but an earache or something, go ahead.\n\nL-54 And about time he got up there, some colonel come in with a little child that had rash, his little boy or girl had rash on his hand. And they stopped that line, to put the colonel's child in, and that boy punctured, dying. There you are.\n\nL-55 Oh, if that colonel would have been a genuine feeling for his brother out there in the line, he would've said, \"This kid can wait. Get that man up here quickly, do something for him!\"\n\nL-56 But every man wants to show his authority. Now, they're not all like that; no, they're not all like that. But there is too many like that. There's too many of them that's like that. But the man, only thing he was thinking of, was his own little boy that had a rash on his hand, and not thinking about that poor boy standing there mashed under a tank, the very tank and maybe the very boy that would save his life someday on the battle front. See, they don't stop to think; only for themselves. \"A thinking man's filter.\"\n\nL-57 I looked at it, and I thought, \"It's something like the--the denominations of today, the churches that we have.\" Each one of them has their own filter; they have their own type of filter. They let just what come in they want to, and what not come in; what they filter in and filter out, with their own kind of a filter. They just let so much of the world get in to satisfy the unbelievers that's in there. They'll take them in no matter what they are, if they got money. They'll take them in no matter what they are, if they're popular. But there is one thing about it, you can't get in the Church of God like that; not the denomination now, I mean the real, genuine Church of God.\n\nL-58 Like the tobacco companies of today, the people that comes into these said churches or denominations, they have a taste, and that taste is the classics of the world. And each denomination has their own filter, and they filter out all the true Christians that would say \"amen\" when he was preaching; and bring in all the bobbed-haired, painted-faced Jezebels that's in the country, as long as they are popular. \"So-and-so comes to our... a movie star, a great person.\" That's the kind of a filter that they use. \"Our denomination. So-and-so, the president, or the--or the colonel, or someone belongs to our denomination.\" See what kind of a filter they use? That filter, of course, is of the world, the people of 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min the world. [I Corinthians 11:5], [II Kings 9:30], [Ezekiel 23:40-45]\n\nL-59 The people, they know what they want. So if they have to get what they want, then they'll have to have a certain kind of a filter, and enough of the world speak through, to satisfy their worldly taste. \"A thinking man's filter, a smoking man's taste.\" A religious world's filter, and a worldly man's taste.\n\nL-60 They want to be religious. They think they must be religious, because they have a soul.\n\nL-61 When we first come to this country, you found the Indian worshiping suns and so forth, because (why?) he is a human being. We go back in the far jungles of Africa, we find the natives worshiping something. Why? They're human beings, and they want, must worship.\n\nL-62 So the human being, no matter how fallen he is, he still knows there is something somewhere. But he's got such a taste for the world, that he cannot take the correct filter. He has to have his own made filter. Each one making their own kind of filter.\n\nL-63 Each cigarette company brags on theirs, what they can do, \"A real filter! This is the best filter! All up front!\" and all like that. Said, \"The taste comes,\" or something, \"from up front.\" Oh, for goodness' sakes. \"Up front\"? What's on the back end of it, though? It sure ain't a thinking man or a thinking woman. But that's what they say, just simply deceiving the people.\n\nL-64 Now we find out, of our day, that the people has got a taste. And why does a man smoke a cigarette? Is to satisfy a taste. What does the woman smoke a cigarette for? Satisfy a taste.\n\nL-65 And then if the church has figured out, a religious group, they... to get people in there, they've got to have a certain kind of a filter to give the people the taste that they want. So if they don't get any taste that they want, they don't want the cigarette. And if they can't get the taste that they want in religion, they don't take the religion. Now, just as plain as it can be.\n\nL-66 Women with shorts, bobbed-hair, painted faces, sexy-dressed, they want that. They love that.\n\nL-67 As I spoke this morning and last Sunday morning, on that wheel in the middle of the wheel, or that little inside soul on the inside of the spirit. How that the spirit on the outside, between the soul and the body, can be absolutely anointed with the Holy Ghost. Did you all understand that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-68 Now to follow that in with the continuity of the Message, The God Of This World, The Anointed Ones In The Last Days. That outside, that middle circle... First circle is the--the human senses. The second circle is the spirit senses; will, self-will, desire, and so forth. But the inside is the soul; that soul was predestinated. So, they can anoint this spirit to make the outside body come in subject to the spirit. \"But the soul that sinneth, that soul shall die.\" The soul that rejects, in unbelief, the Word of God, which it is a part of, that soul shall Eternally... has, always. [Ezekiel 18:4], [Romans 6:23]\n\nL-69 I believe in an Eternal death, same as I believe in an Eternal Heaven, but not an Eternal hell. There's no such a thing as Eternal hell. There is an Eternal death for the people that are... Many of them, religious, in the world today, has always been dead.\n\nL-70 \"The woman that liveth in pleasure,\" with her bobbed hair and painted face, \"is dead while she is alive.\" The Bible said so. See? See, she may be religious, but she never was saved. She's got a outward motion. She might sing in the choir, or she might dance in the Spirit, she might speak in tongues, and have all the manifestations of the Spirit. But unless that soul on the inside is God's daughter, see, she is gone, no matter what she does. [I Corinthians 11:5, 13-15], [I Corinthians 13:1-3]\n\nL-71 Israel was all outwardly spiritually, all filled with God's goodness, and how they reverenced God, and so forth, but that didn't work. The inside of them couldn't recognize the Word Itself.\n\nL-72 But when you're born of the Spirit of God, then you've got a... you are a son of God, and you always was a son of God, and you always will be a son of God. No way to separate it, because it's... you have Eternal Life. And Eternal never did begin; neither will it ever end. 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min\n\nL-73 Oh, for the grace of God, that He would give us understanding of such great mysteries! As Paul spoke here, further on down in Ephesians, speaking of the husband and wife, and said, \"This is a mystery,\" how the women should be in respects to their husband. Even the second place, I believe it is, the entire Bible, that reverence was ever spoke to. Said, \"The women, seeing she reverence her husband, reverence her husband.\" Then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a son of God. And if he doesn't live that kind of life, well, then, course, she wouldn't reverence him, because she knows what he's made of. But when it is a man that is reverent man, reverent and clean, with his wife and before his family, a real servant of God, then the women, children, and all, should respect that servant of God, with reverence.\n\nL-74 Notice now. Woman, they want to have bobbed hair. They want to wear shorts, paint, makeup. These little bikinis and things that they--that they wear nowdays, they want to do it; and yet they want to go to church. You see that anointing upon the spirit, not upon the soul. See? [I Timothy 2:9]\n\nL-75 Said, wants to be a Christian and also do these things, and the pastor says it's okay. Then if he says it's okay, \"You can be a member; your name can be on my church book here; it's okay,\" then he is giving her his denominational filter to suit a worldly woman's taste. She loves the world; she likes the taste of it. So he's got a filter for her, but she's a long ways from being a thinking woman. But there you are. That's where I found this text.\n\nL-76 No, she isn't a--a thinking woman. If she was thinking, she would know the church isn't going to judge her at the last Day. The church is judging her now by her membership, her loyalty to the circles that she belongs to and the societies. They're judging her now by that. But God is going to judge her at the last Day. So she isn't thinking. [John 12:48]\n\nL-77 Just like the man that's smoking; he loves the cigarette so well until his thinking faculties has become numbed with nicotine. And the woman's desires have so numbed her thinking faculties until she'll do these things that's evil in the sight of the Lord, 'cause she wants to do it; it satisfies a worldly woman's taste. So she takes a worldly church's filter; she goes right through it, fine, nothing to bother. Shows...\n\nL-78 Now we see there that that is Truth. And the pastor says, \"That's all right. We don't condemn the women of doing that. It's all right.\" There's enough sin in it; that's through his filter. Shows that they went through a theological filter. And they got a theological taste; and they had a theological taste. But it certainly didn't go through God's Filter. No, sir.\n\nL-79 Now, if there is a theological filter for the theological thinker, and there is a church filter for the church thinker, a cigarette filter for the cigarette thinker, there's got to be a real filter somewhere for the real thinker. And God has a Filter, and that's His Word. It's a separator, for It's the waters of separation for sin. Now, that's the thinking man or the holy man's taste. [John 14:15], [I John 2:3-6]\n\nL-80 And if a man goes through this kind of a filter of the world, he--he's got a worldly taste. And like the tobacco company, he gets more members in his church by pushing them through this filter. If they say, \"There is more women goes to church than there is man.\" That may be so. Now, that may be all so true, when she can go and do anything she wants to. That's right. She'll do, she'll join up with anything, but she went through that church filter. If she went through God's Filter, she would come out different from that. See? She couldn't go through God's Filter and come out with bobbed hair. She just can't do it. [I Peter 3:4-6]\n\nL-81 Now this is going to be a--a little bitter maybe to somebody. But when she started through God's Filter, and It says in there for them not to cut their hair, then (what?) she lodges on the other side. If It said it's a sin for a woman to do such, and she's dishonorable to do such. \"If she wants to,\" he says, \"well, she's got to have her hair cut.\" Said, then, \"Shave it off then.\" And said, \"We know that that's a shame for a woman to have a head shorn.\" Said, \"Then let her have her head covered.\" And her hair is her covering; not a hat, lady. Her hair is her covering, the Bible said. Right. Shows she's a Nazarite unto the Lord. Long hair, to a woman, means a Nazarite to the Lord. Now, we find that that's true. [Numbers 6:2-5]\n\nL-82 But we find if the thinking man, so-called in the world, can smoke and still get his taste, he ought to have sense 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min enough to know he's getting tar from the tobacco. But it only, what it's done, is to sell him more, make him buy more cigarettes.\n\nL-83 And the church filter gets the membership and things like that when they let them get through with anything and still belong to the church, they get more members. What if we went to the churches tonight and filter everybody out besides those who was genuine Word-born Christians. There'd be a many a blank sermon up against a wall tonight, it's true, 'cause it went through the Filter.\n\nL-84 And if I've got one desire in my heart, and I hope that everybody listening to me has the same thing, \"God, take me through Your Filter.\" As David said, \"Try me, and prove me, and see if there be any evil in me, then take it out, Lord.\" See? I want God's Filter. Don't care what the world does, what the church has; I want to be a thinking man, to think Who I'm going to be standing by one of these days, for Judgment. [Psalms 26:2]\n\nL-85 Notice, the tobacco company does it to sell more cigarettes; the church does it to get more members. A woman with short hair, wearing shorts, would be caught in God's Filter. She could not go through It, with short hair, because the Bible said she shouldn't do it. She dishonors her head when she does it. We should know it. But she goes right through the church all right, all the rest of them. I stand sometimes... [I Corinthians 11:5, 15]\n\nL-86 Not disregarding anybody; I never speak personally about any person, but it's sin in the church. You bear me record of that. I didn't say, \"Miss So-and-so is so-and-so, or Mr. So-and-so, or Rev. So-and-so is so-and-so.\" No, sir. I say sin is sin. If it's in my family, it's in me, it's in whoever it is, it's still sin. Not as an individual, I don't speak against individuals. I speak against sin. I don't care if it's me or whoever it is, starts through God's Filter, any sin will stop you right there.\n\nL-87 Notice. But the woman who wants to have short hair and wear shorts, or wear paint and anything, she can go right through a Pentecostal filter just as easy as pie, nothing about it, right into death. Cause, he the... She say, \"Well, there's no harm in that.\" \"If you love the world or the things of the world, it's because the love of God is not even in you.\" [I John 2:15]\n\nL-88 Down through this spirit, then, she can pull down into her soul, things that isn't of God and against God's Word, if that's the taste in the soul. It can come through the taste; see, taste... It can come through the think, through the reasoning, \"There's no harm in it. I have taste. I have feelings. I have a feeling that this is all right.\" She can come right on down through that, and right into her soul, if her soul is of that type. Shows that she isn't drawing through God's Filter. But if she's got bobbed hair, wearing makeup, shorts, pants, looks like man's, all these slacks and ever what they call them; saying those kind of things, and doing those things, and living for the world, she'll stop; she can't get through There. No, sir. It'll stop her at the beginning.\n\nL-89 Notice, a man looking at her pretty red lips and painted face, and shorts and--and bikinis, and ever what she's got; a real thinking man won't look at her. Now, a man that's a church member will look at her, admire her. But I don't care how she looks to the eye, a thinking man will turn his head. Why? He's been through God's Filter, and he knows to look upon her is adultery in his heart. He don't think she's pretty. Say, \"Isn't she a pretty thing!\" Not to him it isn't. She's a filthy-looking, miserable Jezebel wretch, to a thinking man. A son of God looks upon her with shame that he even belongs to the family she belongs to. That's right. \"How could that be my sister and act like that?\"\n\nL-90 See, she pulled through one filter, and he come through another. He won't think she's pretty, not at all. That's not beauty to a real man of God.\n\nL-91 Remember, one time before the Blood of Jesus Christ become the Filter, as we'll get to in a few minutes, \"The sons of God looked upon the daughters of man, that they were fair, and taken unto them wives.\" God never did forgive it. Again it happened, in the march of Israel, and God never did forgive them. Every one of them perished. A thinking man's Filter! 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min I come out of the meeting here; there was a little ricky standing back here behind the church one night, said to me, about three or four years ago, said, \"The reason you say that, you're an old man.\" Said, \"I think they look nice.\" I said, \"I can imagine that.\" From just the looks of him, you can tell what he looked like. I said, \"Let me tell you something. How old are you?\" \"About thirty years old.\" [Genesis 6:2]\n\nL-92 I said, \"When I was fifteen years younger than you, I thought the same thing.\" Right. And it's still filth!\n\nL-93 A thinking man's Filter! Now notice, if he has been, his mind filtered through the Word of God, God's Filter, he won't look upon her. He won't think she's pretty; he'll think she's a Jezebel. He'll think, behind those red lips is poison fangs that would sting him. And the Bible said, \"Her gates is the gates of hell; and a man walks into them like an ox going to his slaughter.\" There's a thinking man's Filter. [Proverbs 7:22, 27]\n\nL-94 What do you desire? When the woman comes down the street dressed like that, and you man turn your head, gaze around like that, you're not using a thinking man's Filter. Because, when you do that, you are committing adultery, for the Filter said, \"Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already.\" Turn your head, thinking man. Get away from her. She's not pretty. She's a serpent; that's right, twists like one, acts like one, stings like one. Keep away from her. [Matthew 5:27-30]\n\nL-95 Oh, yes, the Word of God is a thinking man's Filter. Anyone knows that. That's what your soul is filtered through, the Word of God. And It makes, when you come through God... When a thinking man comes through God's Filter, it gives him a holy man's taste. That's right. When you come through God's Filter, then your taste is a holy man's taste. It makes a righteous man's taste. The slogan certainly is okay. [Ephesians 5:25-27]\n\nL-96 Now we find out how this was done in a type, in Israel, for the congregation of Israel only. That's the reason, speaking this now, if ministers disagree on anything that's said; this is for my congregation that the Lord has given me to--to preach to.\n\nL-97 Notice in Exodus 19, I want you to read it when you go home, when you have more time. Notice, when Israel had committed sin, first they took a red heifer which had never had a yoke on her neck. That means she never was yoked up with anything. [Numbers 19:2]\n\nL-98 And she had to be red. The color red is a--an atonement color. You know, science knows that if you take red and look through red, to red, it's white. Look through red, at red, it's white. He looks through the red Blood of the Lord Jesus, and our red sins become as white as snow; red through red. And the heifer was killed in the evening time, by the whole congregation of Israel. And there was put seven stripes of her blood upon the door where the whole congregation had to enter; a type of the Seven Church Ages, by the Blood.\n\nL-99 And then her body was taken and burnt. It was burnt with the hoof, with the skin, with the intestines, with the dung. Everything was burnt, together. And it had to be picked up by a clean man, and had to be put in a clean place outside the congregation. Therefore, if Israel could only see the type! This Word of God must not be handled by dirty hands of unbelief. It's got to be a clean man. And if he's clean, he had to come through God's Filter. A clean man, clean hands, and had to be kept in a clean place; not a place where Jezebels, and Rickies, and everything partake; and take the communion and things, when they're running around with wives, and husbands, and all kinds of filth; going to dances and parties, and wearing bobbed hair, and shorts, and everything else, and calling themselves Christians. It's to be kept in a clean place, and handled with clean hands.\n\nL-100 And then when Israel sinned, and recognized that they had done wrong, then they were sprinkled with the ashes of this heifer, upon them. And that was the water of separation, a purification for sin.\n\nL-101 Notice. Here it is! And when Israel, before they could come into fellowship in the worship, they had to first pass through the waters of separation. \"Justification by faith; cometh by hearing, hearing the Word.\" Then they entered into the congregation under those seven stripes, the blood, to show that something died and went 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min before them, for their sin. They were separated by hearing the Word, the waters of separation, then entered into fellowship.\n\nL-102 The only place that God met a man was behind that order. He wouldn't meet him anywhere else. He had to come behind that order. God only met Israel in one place. And God only meets you today in one place, and that's in Jesus Christ; and He is the Word, the waters of separation. And His Blood was shed for all Seven Church Ages. And then, by the Holy Spirit, we enter into that fellowship, which is only given to the Church. Oh, how great He is!\n\nL-103 Also, now, we want to look at Ephesians 5:26, said, \"It is the washing of the water by the Word,\" a waters of separation. What does It do? Then, the Filter of God is the Word. Waters of separation, \"washing of the waters, of separation, by the Word,\" God's Filter. [Ephesians 5:26]\n\nL-104 Then, you can't come into Christ through a church filter. You cannot come by a denominational filter or a creed filter. There is only one Filter, that you can enter into that holy place, that's through \"the washing of the water by the Word.\" The Word of God is a thinking man's Filter.\n\nL-105 The church will judge you here whether you're a good member, or not. They'll give you a good funeral, and half-mast the flag at your death, send great wreaths of flowers and--and do everything for you. But when it comes down to your soul facing God, it's got to have Eternal Life. And if it's a Eternal Life, it's part of the Word. And as my own word cannot deny... My own hand cannot deny my hand. My own eyes cannot deny my hand, or my foot, or my toe, or any part of me. They cannot deny it. And neither can a man that's part of the Word of God, or a woman, deny one part of the Word of God. Then, women, when you think you can have bobbed hair and come in the Presence of God, you're wrong. You see it? You are wrong; you can't come through God's Filter where you're washed by the water of the Word. Then you enter into the fellowship. You think you are, but you can't be until you come through the Word, and every little spot, every little Word of God. \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word.\" It's got to come through that filtration, coming through. And that gives a righteous man's taste, 'cause that's what he's looking for, looking for something to cleanse him. [Deuteronomy 8:3], [Matthew 4:4]\n\nL-106 The Word, the Word of God is a thinking man's Filter, and It makes a righteous man's taste. We know that true; filters all the sin of unbelief out. There's no more disbelief when you come through the Filter, because it is a true believer's taste.\n\nL-107 The true believer wants to be right, regardless. He just don't want to say, \"Well, I belong in the social ranks. I belong to church, the biggest church in town.\" I don't care if it's a mission on the corner, if it's a brush harbor, somewhere, a thinking man knows that he's got to meet God. And regardless of what the church says, or anybody else says, he's got to come on God's terms. And God's terms is God's Word. \"Well,\" they say, \"'God's Word.'\" Sure, all of them believe It's God's Word, but can you filter through It? How you going to let a bobbed-haired woman come through There? How you going to do that? How you going to let a man come through There that won't hold up for this Doctrine? See? It ain't a thinking man's taste. No. A thinking man will think, a thinking man will think twice before he jumps into something like that.\n\nL-108 Notice, that Word cannot deny Itself. Then it is satisfied, or it's the desire. It's a desire of what? What made you desire It, in the first place? Because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was Eternal Life, always laying in there, always was in there. \"All that the Father has given Me will come to Me. There isn't any of them going to be lost.\" [John 6:39], [John 18:9]\n\nL-109 A thinking man's taste, when a thinking man hears the Word of God, \"My sheep hear My Voice, a stranger they will not follow,\" for down in there is Life, and Life connects with Life. 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min Sin connects with sin, and sin is so hypocritical until it thinks that it's saved when it isn't saved. It's in the very depths of hypocrisy.\n\nL-110 Church members want a denomination filter so that they can have their own desire and still be classed \"religious\" people. You hear them say, \"Oh, he's very religious.\" [John 10:4-5]\n\nL-111 In Africa, was out there one day, and they was talking about these, some of the kids was talking about these rock-and-roll songs that Elvis Presley and them was singing, Pat Boone and whatevermore, Ricky Nelson and all them others. I said, \"They're a bunch of renegades.\" Some little girl said, \"Why, he's very religious.\"\n\nL-112 I said, \"So was Judas.\" I said, \"Judas only got thirty pieces of silver; Elvis Presley got several million dollars.\" See? \"They both sold out their birthrights.\" See? I said, \"They're noth-... the very worst indebtment the nation's got.\" Still, just as deceiving as the filter of the cigarette, these denominations let those members come in. They oughtn't to even be... There ought to be a law that they couldn't sing religious songs. It's against... ought to be against the law for them to do it. But the whole thing has become one great big pile of hypocrisy, and there's where they stay today. The true Filter for the soul, says, \"If you love the world or the things of the world, the love of God is not even in you.\" [I John 2:15]\n\nL-113 See, you can't--you can't say rock-and-roll is of the world... or is of God. Rock-and-roll is of the world. Any of those dances and filtered... nasty filthy things, rather, is of the world. It's all of the world. You can't say that bobbed hair for a woman is of God. The Bible says it's not, so it's the filth of the world. And if you love one speck of the world, the love of God is not even in you. See?\n\nL-114 What's that? Well, what's drawing it? It's something down on the inside drawing. The soul is drawing your resource through the outside, down through the spirit, into the soul. And if the soul loves the world, it's dead. I don't care how it's anointed, it is out here, and how righteous it is out here; down in here it's dead. \"For he that loves the world or the things of the world, the love of God is not even in him,\" no matter how religious.\n\nL-115 The true Filter, that way, will--will set all those things out and bring nothing but the trueness of God, the Word, into the real true soul.\n\nL-116 They're like Esau, outwardly okay. Esau was religious on the outside. And when it comes to religion, it seemed to be more religious than Jacob was. He seemed to be a better man than Jacob was, but the inside of him, what he was. He was outwardly religious, but his thinking was not filtered. He didn't think right of the birthright. He--he didn't think that God, the birthright meant as much as God said it did. There he was, said, \"I'm hungry, what difference it make about the old birthright? You can have it if you want it.\" Oh, my! See? \"I go to church; I'm just as good as you are. My denomination is just as... Why, it's one of the greatest in the world. My mother belonged to it. My father belonged to it. All this, that, and the other. My pastor was educated; he's got so-and-so.\" That puts him that much farther from God. That ain't a thinking man's filter. If it would, how could Peter ever been what he was, when he couldn't sign his own name? But he packed the thinking man's Filter. Notice. Oh, my! [Genesis 25:29-34]\n\nL-117 Esau thought that that birthright didn't mean what God said it did. That was the difference between Life and death. And so, like Eve and like Judas, sold their birthrights for a satisfaction of the taste of the knowledge of civilization. That's exactly what Eve sold her birthrights for. She sold it for a little taste of science, a little taste of worldly knowledge, a little better church, a little better class of people, today it would be called. See? And Judas sold his birthrights for thirty pieces of silver, and make a few extra dollars. \"My congregation can pay me better over here, and I'll just preach over here.\" See? \"So, if I become a preacher, well...\" [Genesis 25:29-34]\n\nL-118 They said, \"Brother Branham, we believe that Message is the Truth, but we can't accept It. If we did, why, where would we preach at?\" Huh! The world, brother, that's the parish. Certainly. \"Well, none of the brethren would back me up.\" I--I ain't looking for none of the brethren to back me up. I'm looking for Jesus Christ to back me up, because He stood by It. He's the One Who said It. 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min\n\nL-119 And when the true birthright, the Blood, filtered out by the Word; and all sin, and the world, and church, and denominations, and sectarianism, is left outside. Education, civilization, church, denomination, system, sin of all types is left outside when a thinking man takes a thinking man's Filter, in God's estimation.\n\nL-120 There is nothing left in it when a man draws his--his life through a God's Filter; notice, here your life was all messed up with sin, because you were \"born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the world speaking lies.\" I'm going to say something, as Brother McCullough used to say. Listen to me. [Psalms 51:5], [Psalms 58:3]\n\nL-121 When you come in this world, you were born in sin. You didn't even come with a fighting chance. You were \"born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the world speaking lies,\" within your own spirit, the desire of sin, a lover of sin because you were born in sin. You didn't have a chance. But down inside of you, somewhere, here you come, there was something in there that begin to draw. If you knowed, it was something that told you there was a God somewhere; and you read His Word. Then you took the church, you took their ideas when you was told better, then you never used a thinking man's Filter. But when you use God's Filter, which is a thinking man's Filter, because, \"All other filters will pass away, but Mine shall not.\" And when you take God's Filter and draw your life, your desires; if you draw your desires through God's Filter, a thinking man's Filter, there is nothing left but the Holy Ghost. [Luke 21:33]\n\nL-122 Now, if you want the evidence of the Holy Ghost, there it is. When that soul of yours will line with the Word of God, in every respect, it shows you've drawed your life through the thinking man's Filter, God's Filter.\n\nL-123 Notice, is that God's Filter? He said, \"We was washed by the water of the Word.\" And when God gave Adam and Eve a Filter, in the garden of Eden, He said, \"Don't you draw none of this in there.\" But Satan punched a hole in It, said, \"Oh, it's a little bit, won't hurt.\" Just one drop, through, it's all it took to set death into the human race. That's all it takes, just one taste of nicotine, then they're gone.\n\nL-124 There is nothing left but the Holy Ghost. And then that shows that in you was that predestinated seed down in you, that makes you hunger for God. \"All the Father hath given Me, has given Me to redeem; they died with Me at Calvary; they raised with Me in the resurrection; all that He has given Me, will come to Me. They'll be placed in the Body, where foot, arm, nose, mouth, whatever it is; they'll be placed in There. And they will come to Me in their seasons.\" Oh, my!\n\nL-125 There is that real filtration of all the sin of the world, and the love of the world is dead, and this soul is drawing only one thing. Here it is, don't... Remember! Don't forget it. All you out there on the telephones, set this down in your mind. When a thinking man begins to think Who he's going to stand before, and what the Word of God is; when he begins to think, then when he draws through That, there's nothing can get to it but the Holy Ghost. What is it? It's the germ, seed Word from the beginning, that you was in God at the beginning, standing here drawing the seed Life. The seed is in your heart, by foreordination. Hallelujah! The seed is already in there, by the foreknowledge of God, predestinated. And when it draws, it can't draw through nothing else but the Word. And then it's the taste of the thinking man, the righteous man, the holy man who sees the Bible, that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever. What comes into that place down there? That Word, that's in the heart. \"I've hid Thy Word in my heart, that I sin not against Thee.\" What is it, when it's drawing through the Word? There's only one thing will pass through the Word; that's the Holy Ghost. That's the only thing that can pass through the Word, is the Holy Ghost. And a thinking man's Filter gives a holy man a taste. [Hebrews 13:8], [Psalms 119:11]\n\nL-126 Then, he's tasted of the Heavenly things; he's got the Word of God in his heart. He sees It manifested before him, and his whole soul is wrapped into It, and the world and all things is dead around him.\n\nL-127 A thinking man's Filter, of religion; and I'm thinking of filtering religion now. When a thinking man's Filter gives a holy man's taste, see, It satisfies his taste. He sees that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. There it is. See Him right before us, doing the same things He did; it satisfies the holy man's taste, his thinking. 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min\n\nL-128 He knows then that he's passed from death unto Life. And he loves, and--and--and it loves for the world... to be confirmed, and wants the Word to be confirmed and vindicated. In each age he waits for It, for he is a holy man and he's got a desire to see God. Others just wants to join church. This man wants to see God. He don't see Him in a bunch of creeds. He don't see Him in big fine pipe organs, or cathedrals, and high crosses, or polished-up scholars with their collars turned around. He doesn't see Him in theology and in a theologian. He sees Him in the confirmation of His Word. I seen Him in the watchfires of It. My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is tramping out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He's loosed the fateful lightning with His terrible swift sword; His Truth keeps marching on. (It will, to the end. Yes, sir.)\n\nL-129 See what I mean? A Filter, man... Or, a thinking man's Filter; a man that wants to stand in the Presence of God. What was God's Filter? His Word. \"The day you eat thereof, that day you die.\" Don't care what's happening out here; don't you pass that Word. \"Washed by the waters of the Word,\" a thinking man's Filter. Not a denomination, not a creed, not a church, not a cathedral; but a thinking man's Filter, for you're going to be judged by the Word. A thinking man will think that. A foolish man, or a taste of the world, will just take anything, a substitute. Why substitute when there's a real One? [Genesis 2:17]\n\nL-130 Think, just think of it a minute. A woman speaking in tongues, with bobbed hair and lipstick on, and then the church still holds to it, that that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost.\n\nL-131 Or a preacher from a seminary or some Bible school, using the trinitarian baptism, or compromising with the Word, to some creed or denomination. Is that a thinking man's Filter? Not the way I see it, brother. It's a foolish man drawing through that. That's right. Could you imagine that? Instead of using God's Word as a Filter for his soul; letting that old creed and denomination pile in on top of him like that, instead of taking God's Word for a Filter. And then he's all contaminated, and let them induce into him doctrines of man, doing things, \"almost deceiving the very Elected,\" and neglecting the Word. When, he could draw to his own soul, if there's anything in there to draw by. But if that predestinated seed... Don't miss this. If that predestinated seed is not in there, it will not draw through There, because it'll draw for its desire.\n\nL-132 If a smoking man wants a smoking man's taste, and if he had got a hold of a stick... I say, \"Suck your finger,\" and he stood there sucking his finger. [Brother Branham sucks on his finger, to illustrate--Ed.]\n\nL-133 Why, he'd say, \"That's silly.\" Why? His taste is for nicotine. So, he's not a thinking man. See? But you say, \"Well, I don't, I won't taste nothing. I want to taste the... I want to taste tobacco. I don't taste a thing.\"\n\nL-134 Give him a clothespin and let him suck on that. See? Sure, let him suck on that. He say, \"I don't taste nothing.\" What you sucking on it for, then? You've got a desire to taste nicotine. And when you're sucking on a church creed, and still you women wear bobbed hair, painted faces, and is sexy dressed; and you man look at them, and all these other things, and carry on the way you do. What is it? What's in there? The world is still in there, and you got a taste. You're pulling on it for a taste.\n\nL-135 \"I go to this church; they don't never name that thing. They don't say nothing about this, nothing about that. None of these things are brought up. Our preacher is more wide-minded than that. We don't say things like that.\" What is it? You've got the taste of the world you're sucking for. Right!\n\nL-136 But a thinking woman won't take that kind of a thing. She knows she's got to be holy. And the only thing that you can draw through God's Word is the Spirit, the quickening Power to make the Word Itself, which is in you, live to manifest Jesus Christ in the age you're living. Hallelujah! Brother, if that ain't the Truth, I don't know what the Truth is. I've lost my mind if that isn't the Truth.\n\nL-137 It is the Word Itself in your heart, predestinated there, that's drawing. And it spits out that world; it don't want it. But when it gets over here in the Word, it begins to draw. And when it draws through the Word, it can be nothing else 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min but the Holy Ghost to quicken that Word.\n\nL-138 Then a thinking, religious man's Filter is the Word, and it satisfies that holy taste that's in his heart; a thinking man's filter, a holy man's taste. Oh, my, what we're into!\n\nL-139 Instead of using God's Filter for his soul, he's letting Satan deceive him by some denomination or creed, just exactly like the tobacco companies are deceiving you people that smoke cigarettes. You just get more members, and that's all. Oh, let me close in a few minutes, saying this.\n\nL-140 Blind Laodicea! How blind can we get! Blind Laodicea, the leading the blind of this age, under false pretense, under false creeds, under dogmas that's false, under denomination that's false, under creed books that's false. Oh, blind Laodicea, leading the blind, you're all headed for the ditch! [Revelation 3:14-22]\n\nL-141 Change your filter tonight, preacher. Don't draw that denominational nicotine into your system, of dogmas and creeds, which Jesus said, \"Whosoever shall add one word to It, or take one Word from It.\" When you tell your congregation it's right for them women to do that, and those man to do that, and all these things, that and the other; as long as they stay true to this and do that, and keep these creeds and things, aren't you ashamed of yourself? \"Blind Pharisees,\" Jesus said. [Revelation 22:18-20]\n\nL-142 And as Jesus cried, \"Blind Pharisees,\" the Holy Spirit in my own heart tonight cries, \"Blind Laodicea! How oft God would have give you a revival! But now your time has come; it's too late now. How did you laugh and make fun of the people that God sent to you! But now your time has come. Oh, United States, United States, how that God would have hovered you as a--a hen does its brood, but you would not.\" Now this Voice is going from coast to coast, from north to south, and east to west. How God would have hovered you, but you would not! Now your time has come. [Luke 13:34]\n\nL-143 Nations are breaking. The world is falling apart. Fifteen-hundred-mile chunk of it, three- or four-hundred-miles wide, will sink, hundred... or maybe forty miles down into that great fault out yonder, one of these days, and waves will shoot plumb out to the state of Kentucky. And when it does, it'll shake the world so hard that everything on top of it will shake down.\n\nL-144 Oh, hide me in the Rock of ages! God, let me, let me. Breathe upon me, Lord. Spirit of the living God, breathe on me. Let me take God's Filter and live under That, Lord. Let me breathe the fresh air of the Holy Ghost into my lungs, in my soul each day, that I sin not against You, O Lord. Breathe on me, Holy Spirit, breathe on me! I... [Psalms 31:3-5]\n\nL-145 Let me plant the Word of God in my heart, and purpose there that I'll not turn to the right hand or to the left hand, away from It, but I'll live true to It all the days of my life. And, O Father God, then send down upon me the Holy Spirit of Life, to quicken those Words to me, that I might manifest Jesus Christ before those who are before me, to looking for it to happen. That's my prayer. [Psalms 119:11], [Joshua 23:6], [II Corinthians 4:10-11]\n\nL-146 Oh, my! Notice how they do today in those churches. Sucking the people through those denominational filters, into the ecumenical council. Why? Why? For it gives them the desire of their heart, organization. They have a taste for organization. They'll do it.\n\nL-147 Every time God sent them a revival, and, they, what'd they do? They organize it. Is that right? So they got their kind of filter, because they've got a great taste. And now God is going to give them their desire of their taste. He's going to give them... They're sucking them right into the ecumenical council, and then they get their organizational taste then. They got it coming.\n\nL-148 Oh, church of Laodicea, don't be deceived in this age, by their deceptions. Oh, Pentecost, you who have gone into Laodicea, you who are part of Laodicea, the church dead; through Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian, just a ritualistic form. But you Pentecostals who could still once in a while say \"amen\"; who can play a lot of music up on a platform, and have bobbed-haired women dancing all over the place, and still do believe in Divine healing; how oft God would have took you, but you took another filter, a denominational filter. How oft God would have took you! 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min\n\nL-149 How deceiving it was! Matthew 24:24, Jesus said that the... \"It would deceive the very Elected if it was possible.\" How close that you are, just like Eve, just leaving off one or two little things that you wouldn't receive, because you're organized and can't receive It. That's all it takes. Just might as well take the whole thing, \"For to offend in the least, is guilty of the whole.\" Oh! [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-150 Pentecost, Pentecost, pass thy thinking through God's Filter, not your denominational dreams, and you will come out with a holy man's taste, the true baptism of the Holy Spirit.\n\nL-151 Could you imagine a man letting his wife cut her hair, wear shorts, or wear slacks, and say he's coming through a thinking man's Filter? Could you imagine a man doing a thing like that?\n\nL-152 Can you imagine a preacher standing in the pulpit, because he's paid good by a congregation that pats him on the back, calls him, \"Doctor, Brother, Reverend,\" and takes him out to all kinds of parties where they mix bathing, and everything else, on the beaches; could you imagine a man claiming that he's coming through a thinking man's Filter? [John 10:11-14]\n\nL-153 And some of those women on the platform, with their dresses above their knees, and cut so tight and shows every form, every move they make, and their underneath clothes showing through their dresses; just as bad as wearing shorts, bikinis, or anything else. You Pentecostal, blind, Laodicean preachers, how long will God suffer you, I don't know. Be... God be merciful to your--to your blind eyes. He's got eyesalve tonight, to open your eyes, that you might see. [I Timothy 2:9], [Revelation 3:18]\n\nL-154 As I said this morning, we're in the seeing age, the top. There's no more faculties above that, that you can move outwardly, to know. You, from your nose, you can smell; from your lips, you can speak; from your hands, you can feel and reach; and your feet, and so forth; but you can't go farther than your eyes.\n\nL-155 Malachi 4 has come; sight! \"And it shall be Light about the evening time.\" Oh, walk in the Light! We'll walk in the Light, a beautiful Light, That comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around me by day and by night, Jesus, the Word, the Light of the world.\n\nL-156 Yes, sir. Pass through It, oh, brother, and you will come out with a holy man's taste, with the Holy Ghost.\n\nL-157 Oh, woman, just pass your modern thinking of dress. Pass your modern thinking, before you go out on the street before man; you young women, you old women, before you go out on the street with your clothes so tight, pushed out in the back and front. I'm not critical. I'm your brother. I stand between the living and the dead, and realize what I'm saying. Before you enter out, and know that your body is a sacred order, or a sacred caste that God has given you; before you enter the street, dressed like that, pass your mind through a thinking woman's Filter. And let it remember, that, \"Whosoever looks upon you to lust after you, you have committed adultery with him already.\" Remember that, sister. [I Corinthians 3:16-17], [Matthew 5:27-28]\n\nL-158 And, brother, before you turn your head to look at her, on that second glance, pass your mind through a thinking man's Filter. You'll come out with a holy man's taste, see, of doing what's right.\n\nL-159 Notice, if you pass your mind through a thinking woman's Filter, you'll come out with a holy woman's dress. That's right. You'll come out, brother, with a holy man's look. Now, that's just one thing. Everything that you do, pass it through the Filter of God's Word, see if it's right or wrong.\n\nL-160 You'll come out with a holy woman's dress, with long hair, decently dressed; a quiet, humble spirit; not up and brawling, and fighting and carrying on. \"A quiet, meek spirit, which is a great treasure from God.\" The Bible said so. Now I want to ask you something, out in the lands. We're going to close in a few minutes. [I Peter 3:4]\n\nL-161 Now let us all, tonight, check our desires, and then you can see what kind of a filter you've been drawing through. Let's check, each one of us, here and out across the nation. Check your desires, what you want really in life. Check what you're fighting for. Check what you're here for. Check what you go to church for. What makes you... It's good to 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min go to church, but just don't go to church only; that won't save you. See? Just check just a few minutes, say, \"Is my objective... What--what kind of a filter am I drawing through, anyhow?\" And if you won't cope with the Word of God, and your soul don't do it, then there's something wrong; for it shows up your taste, that the life... what kind of a life is in you. If it's a holy, discreet, honorable, it'll come out that way. If it isn't, you've got another taste in you you're drawing from. That's exactly right. And if the taste is the Word of God and the will of God, then you know what's in you, what's drawing the taste. Shows you are a part of that Word. That Word is in you, drawing from the Word.\n\nL-162 What's It drawing? It's drawing through the Word, because you are a part of the Body of Christ of this age. And if that Word is in you, It can only draw through the Word, the Spirit that quickens that Word that's in you. Just the Word alone won't live. That's the reason, \"All the Father has given Me will come to Me; and if I be lifted up, I'll draw all men unto Me.\" See? See, \"the Father,\" the part of the Body of Christ that's in the world, predestinated, put into the heart. [John 12:32]\n\nL-163 Any man that's a real Christian, born again today, knows, since he was a little kid, or a little girl, either, that there was something in you that hungered for God. And you tried joining churches and everything else; it wouldn't work. What was it? It was that Word. You was hunting for a Filter. And one day It passed before you; you seen Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. That satisfied the taste. See? Cause, life was in you, drawing. See, the life in you is drawing. It's--it's telling what desire you got here. You're pulling. You can't pull through this, and that, and the other. You've got to find that right Filter, 'cause you're a thinking person. See? [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-164 If you're a thinking person, you are predestinated, or filtered 'fore... from before the foundation of the world.\n\nL-165 And if a denominational minister hears this, I hope that he takes the thinking man's Filter, if he's a denomination minister. Then he'll throw down that denominational pack that's sure to perish, 'cause it's the word of man; and accept God's filtered Word that can never fail nor pass away, and It will suit the holy man's taste. And, like Jacob, will sacrifice all the world and the appetites of every denomination or fame, that there is in the world, where you can be bishop, cardinal, whether you can be a state presbyter, or a pastor of some great church. You'll sacrifice everything that there is. Not like Esau, to become part of the world; but like Jacob, you'll give everything you've got to obtain the birthright, the Filter of the thinking man; 'cause It'll give you the holy man's taste. And It will satisfy. And it'll be satisfy, and will sanctify with the Eternal taste of the holy goodness of God.\n\nL-166 Remember, Satan punched the first hole through Eve's mind, or her thinking, to let the taste of his wisdom and knowledge get through.\n\nL-167 Now think of this. I'm closing. Satan punched the first hole through, 'cause all she could draw was the Word. That was the Spirit through the Word of God, 'cause she said, \"As long as you breathe through this Filter, you'll never die; but you take a breath of this out here, you'll die.\" See?\n\nL-168 And Satan said, \"But you don't know nothing here. But you take a little taste of this here, and then you'll know; you'll be like God. See, He knows right and wrong; you don't. And if you'll just take a little taste of this.\" And she let him punch a hole in it, just one little hole. [Genesis 3:2-5]\n\nL-169 Now you see why I say... You say, \"Why don't you teach women, and so forth, how to receive gifts and things like that?\"\n\nL-170 I said, \"How can you teach them algebra when they won't ever learn their ABC's?\" One little hole is all it took. He took the world's wisdom, and, when it did, it set death to the whole family, wanting to taste of wisdom.\n\nL-171 Now look at the filter, and certainly it expressed her taste. Her taste was for the world; that's what she's got. That's what it is today. They love the world and the things of the world, with a form of godliness, but denying the Power thereof. See, Satan will let them speak in tongues; he'll let them shout; he'll let them have Divine healing services; he'll let them do all these kind of things. 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min\n\nL-172 He say, \"Many will come to Me in that day, and, 'Lord, haven't I cast out devils, have not I done many things, done this?'\" He'll say, \"I didn't even know you, you worker of iniquity.\" When the Word was placed right before you and you still sucked that old filter of the world, see, shows the taste that was in the heart. [Matthew 7:21-23]\n\nL-173 Doves cannot eat a carrion. They cannot eat it. They don't have any gall. A crow can eat the seed like a dove and can eat a carrion like a crow, see, because he's a hypocrite. But a dove is not built like any other bird, and that's why God represented Himself as a Dove descending from Heaven. See? It cannot--it cannot stand the stink of a carrion. It's not a vulture; the reason, it don't have any gall. It couldn't digest it. It would kill it, if it eat it. And a dove never has to take a bath. A dove's body puts out oil from the inside, that keeps it clean. It's a life that's in the dove; it generates in it a oil that keeps the feathers clean. And so is a Christian; there's a Life within them that keeps them clean. It's filtered.\n\nL-174 Oh, notice! Now look at he... at the filter, and certainly you can see the taste thereof, of what they're doing today.\n\nL-175 Look at this modern church. Look at their filter. You can see what they love. See what they got. The love, what do they love? Miss Laodicea which is headed for God's Judgment. That's right. The love, the church love today is for Laodicea, a great organization, a great setup, a great, popular thing, fine-dressed people, highly cultured, full of wisdom, full of the devil, under the deceit of the church of Christ. There's only one word ought to be in there, \"anti-Christ.\" For, everything that Christ taught, they're against practically everything; right, just enough so they can call themselves that.\n\nL-176 Now if you are a thinking people tonight, here and out in the land where the Message is going, your desire will be a Bible taste, not a denominational taste, for you will be judged by the very Bible, the Word that I'm asking you to filter your soul through. And to reject one Word of It, and not let your soul pass through that one Word, you'll be turned down. \"For man shall not live, breathe, by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" [Matthew 4:4]\n\nL-177 And It will be brought into you, predestinated. And when the Lord breathes upon you, His Spirit will quicken that Word to a reality, and you'll see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Oh, my!\n\nL-178 Leave the world's denomination, religious pack. Let it lay like that cigarette pack in the woods. Let it rot and decay. It's--it's a wrong filter. And take the Word, which is Christ, that gives, and reaches, and preserves the taste of Eternal Life, to everyone that will take It, Eternal Life.\n\nL-179 The Word, if you are predestinated, you see It. There's no way to hide It from you. You look there and say, \"Why, It's just so plain before my face! I'd look at It; there It is. I'm looking right at It. I see It. Here It is, the Word; every Word, just Word by Word, living out.\" Then there's a taste of Eternal Life that you want. And when you breathe through That, what can come through That, God's Filter? Nothing but the Spirit; no world, at all; no unbelief, at all. It's God's Filter. And when you breathe through That, nothing can get through That but the Holy Ghost.\n\nL-180 Now you got the evidence of the Holy Ghost, see, a holy man or woman's taste. They want to live. They got Eternal Life. And because this Word is quickened to them, they live; a thinking man's Filter, and a holy man's taste.\n\nL-181 Don't take the world, like them cigarette companies, under a deception, but take the real thinking man's Filter. Filter the breath that you breathe, the food that you eat, everything that you are; breathe it through God's Word, and you'll have a holy man's taste. For, It will produce that, for He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\n\nL-182 And I know, whether we are or whether we are not... I believe that we are. But, if we are not, there is somebody in the world today that's part of the Body of Christ; and It will live only by the Word of God, every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God for this age that we're living in now.\n\nL-183 And I can't see where denomination... Those Words so plainly in the Bible, said it would happen, and the things that would be, and here we are living right in it now. I can't see where it could be anything else but this.\n\nL-184 Church, I realize I've got to stand with you in the Judgment someday. Far be it from me to ever tell you anything 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min wrong, for popularity. I don't want that. If I had my desire, I'd, just my human desire, I'd take my rifle and go to the woods and build me a cabin, and trap, the rest of my life. I'm getting old, tired, weary, and broke down, but I can't quit. There is something in me, grinding. Woe unto me if I don't tell the Truth and the whole Truth. Woe unto me if I don't stand here till the last breath of body has left me. I must stand, regardless of what anyone else says. I'm responsible before God.\n\nL-185 And I truly believe that the things that we are preaching is the Truth. Not because it's me preaching it. No, my brother. No, sir. God knows my heart. How I would like to set out in the congregation and listen to the anointed preach. How much easier it would be on me, certainly 'cause I'd have Eternal Life the same as the man in the pulpit. I'm a part of It the same as he is. I'd go to the same Heaven, have the same privileges. How easy it would be for me to set out there and not take all these bruises, and beats, and carry on. How easy it would be, for out the all night with no sleep, an hour and a half, or two hours; wrestling all night with things that's come up. How easy for me to do that, take up my gun the next morning, my fishing rod, and go fishing or hunting! How easy it would be! But, brother, it fell my lot. May God help me to never shun my post of duty, but to stand loyal and true, and produce to you a thinking man's Filter that'll give you a holy man's taste.\n\nL-186 The thinking-man Filter is the waters, of the waters of separation. It's the purification from sin, which is the Word of God. And the thinking man, the man that knows he's got to stand before God, knows he's got to answer for every Word of the Bible, It'll satisfy that taste that's in your heart. May God help us to receive It, as we bow our heads. [Numbers 19:9], [Ephesians 5:26]\n\nL-187 Dear God, another hour or two has passed on. The clock has moved around now. The Message now goes into history, and It's recorded on the Book. We all have to answer now for this, every move that we made, every word that we said, every thought went through our mind, the record is still playing. And it'll play on till life is over, and then we'll answer at the Day of the Judgment.\n\nL-188 O God, the great Creator of heavens and earth, Whom we do believe, I pray for this people of this day. I pray for myself with them, that Lord Jesus, that You'll hold Your Filter. And if I'm saying anything sacrilegious, Lord, I... in my heart I don't know it. I pray that if it's wrong for me to take Your Word and use such a thing as that, You forgive me for it.\n\nL-189 But, Lord, I thought when You spoke to me there in the woods, You know the time in the morning, it just I couldn't get it off my mind. I accepted it as coming from You. So, Father God, I have already spoke it. And I pray, God, that You'll let it be in the way that I thought it to be, that the thinking man, the man if he's got any thinking at all, he'll know he has to stand in the Presence of God, and he won't take into his soul anything that contaminates or is contrary to the Word of God.\n\nL-190 And, Father, we realize that, as I compared it with these organizations of today; not to be different, Lord. You will judge me, someday, from my heart. And I pray, God, that You'll see that it wasn't to be different, but it was to be honest, to try to be sincere, realizing I hold the purchase of Your Blood, from coast to coast, right now, in my hand. And many of them has believed the Report.\n\nL-191 And, God of Heaven, may there not be one of them lost. I claim them, every one, and hold before them the Filter from sin, the Waters of separation, the Blood of Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh. Grant it, Lord. And may the Holy Spirit pour through every promise, into our souls. And may we be living representatives of the Bride of Jesus Christ, in the time of the eyes, of the seeing in the evening Light, for we present it to You in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-192 You love Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] You believe It? [\"Amen.\"] I, if I said anything wrong, by saying, \"thinking man's filter,\" I can't say no more. I have no education. I just have to say what comes to me. And when I seen that laying there, I thought, \"What a line of hypocrisy!\" And Something said, \"Just like the church.\"\n\nL-193 A thinking man's filter! Oh, my! There's more than that to it. A thinking man wouldn't use it at all. See? Certainly not. And it desires a smoking man's taste, that's right, because he's got to have it to satisfy his taste. But a real, thinking 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min man that knows his soul is going to Judgment, will filter his taste through the Word of God. \"For all the Father has give Me will come to Me.\" And he'll live by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, which is the Waters of separation that separates us from sin. For, when it comes through the Word, we see that it's sin to disbelieve It, so we just believe It and go on. It's a separation from sin. You love Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] [John 6:39] I love Him, I love... Let's just raise our hands now to Him. Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree.\n\nL-194 What did He say? \"This will all man know you are My disciples, when you love, have love one for the other.\" Now let's shake somebody's hands while we sing it again, and say, \"I love you, too, brother.\" I love Him, I... (This is to let you know that...) ... He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree. [John 13:35]\n\nL-195 Now, you like a thinking man's Filter? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] When you go on the street to rub arms with the world tomorrow, brother, sister, have you got the thinking man's Filter? When that man calls you a holy-roller, do you use a thinking man's Filter? When that somebody says something evil against you, do you have a thinking man's Filter? See, do good for evil. Pray for those that despitefully use you, and those who persecute you, then you're breathing through the thinking man's Filter. [Matthew 5:44]\n\nL-196 For if you love those just who love you, as we shook one another's hands, as dearly beloved in the Lord, that's good, but can you also love the unlovable? That's the thinking man's Filter. That's the Spirit of Christ in you, loving those who don't love you, then you have the reward of God. But, now, if you do it as a duty, you still haven't got the thinking man... You're only up in the second cycle. But it's from your heart you really love him, then you're breathing through the thinking man's Filter. And It satisfies a holy man's taste, that you know, from your heart you forgive everybody, everything, no matter what taken place. Isn't He wonderful? ... first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree. We'll walk in the Light, It's a beautiful Light, It comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. We'll walk in this Light, It's such a beautiful Light; And It comes where filtered drops of mercy are bright; Oh, shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. Come, all ye saints of Light, proclaim, Jesus, the Light of the world; Then the bells of Heaven will ring, Jesus, the Light of the world. Oh, we'll walk in the Light, It's such a beautiful Light; It comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Oh, shine all around us by day and by night, 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min Jesus, the Light of the world. You love that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Oh, we'll walk in this Light, It's such a beautiful Light; And It comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us by day and by night, It's Jesus, the Light of the world. I just love that! My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary, O Saviour Divine; Now hear me while I pray, Take all my sin... (Filter me, Lord, through the Word.) O let me from this day Be wholly Thine! Just think of it, filtered through the Word, \"wholly Thine.\" While life's dark maze I tread, And grief around me spread, Be Thou my Guide; Bid darkness turn to day, Wipe sorrow's fears away, Nor let me ever stray From Thee aside. [Brother Branham begins humming My Faith Looks Up To Thee--Ed.] ... to my fainting heart, My zeal inspire; O bid darkness turn to day, And wipe sorrow's tears away, O let me from this day Be wholly Thine!\n\nL-197 Dear God, we love to sing to You, for it's there we express our feelings, our emotion, the whole congregation, as You breathe upon us the Word of Life. We're so grateful, Lord. And that song, receive us, will You, Lord? That's our desire, is to be filtered through the Word of God, walk each day in the Light, the Light of the Gospel. And fill our way each day with love, As we walk with the Heavenly Dove; Let us go all the while, with a song and a smile, Fill our way each day with love.\n\nL-198 Grant it, Lord. Bless us together now. Let Thy grace and mercy be with us. Heal the sick and the afflicted throughout the land.\n\nL-199 We thank You for Brother Coggins tonight, that You let him leave the hospital, to go home well. Thank You for all the things that You've done, and for our own strength that we feel lifted up now.\n\nL-200 We thank You for the little cut up Message tonight, Lord. I--I didn't do it right, but I pray, Lord, that You'll make it right in the people's sight, that they might see and know what it was meant for. Get glory out of it, Lord, and may we have this understanding, if nothing else, that we are to live by the Bread of the Word of God, filtered from God just for His children only. It's a separated congregation. It's for no one else. It's only for those, Your chosen, as the red heifer's waters of separation was for the congregation of Israel only. So, Father, we know that the Bread is for the Sheep only. 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min \"It's not meet that I take the children's bread and cast it to dogs,\" said Jesus. And the woman, in return, said, \"Yes, Lord, that's true, but I'm willing to take the crumbs.\" And we feel that way tonight, Lord. We want all that You can give us, Father, for we're hungering and thirsting for more of You. [Mark 7:27-28]\n\nL-201 Grant that our hungers will be fulfilled and our desires be made known, for, Father, we want to have a righteous man's desire. And the righteous Man was Jesus Christ, and His desire was to do the will of the Father, which was the Word. Grant it to us, Father. We ask it in His Name. Amen. Let us stand now while we sing our dismissing song, of, Take The Name Of Jesus With You.\n\nL-202 Out across the places now, in where the Message has gone tonight, may God be with you now as we dismiss in prayer. May each one of you, out there, I hope you've enjoyed as much listening as I have bringing It to you. And I trust that God will place It in your hearts and give you the right interpretation to it.\n\nL-203 And you people here in the audience that's got these handkerchiefs laying here, I've laid hands upon them. I pray that God will heal every one of you, there won't be any sick people among us, you see how our God answers prayer.\n\nL-204 When we gather together, \"The people that's called by My Name shall assemble themselves together and pray, then I'll hear from Heaven.\" He promised to do it. [James 5:16]\n\nL-205 So, we are not divided. We're just one Person; we're all one, in Christ Jesus. And each one praying for each one; you pray for me as I pray for you. And God bless you till we see you again.\n\nL-206 And I trust that you'll be a constant... you who live here close, will come to the tabernacle and visit here with our good pastor, Brother Neville. He'll do you good, Brother Mann and the fine people they have here in the tabernacle.\n\nL-207 If you're close to Brother Junior Jackson or some of the rest of them throughout the land, New York and different places where they got their meetings, around through Arizona and California, visit those churches if you're out in there. We pray that you'll return again and let the pastor help you to know more about the Lord Jesus.\n\nL-208 God bless you now while we sing Take The Name Of Jesus With You. ... the Name of Jesus with you, Child of sorrow and of woe; It will joy and comfort give you, [Brother Branham speaks to someone on the platform--Ed.] ... you go. Precious Name (precious Name), O how sweet! (O how sweet!) Hope of earth and joy of Heaven; Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven.\n\nL-209 Looking over the congregation tonight, seeing Brother Estle Beeler back there, Brother Palmer, and many, Brother J. T., and so many of the ministers standing around here, I can't call all their names. Wish I could have you, every one, up here, and all of you dismiss the congregation or do something. You understand, don't you? I know you got a Christian heart and know that we have to... how we--how we are; we're altogether one Person, in Christ Jesus.\n\nL-210 Now let's remember this next verse as we sing it, while our Brother Martin here will dismiss us in prayer. And I want to... This is Brother Earl Martin from, I believe, from Arkansas or--or Missouri. [Brother Earl Martin says, \"Missouri.\"--Ed.] Missouri, right on the Arkansas, Missouri line there. They got a church down there.\n\nL-211 And I noticed this other brother from down there, I can't think of his name, Brewer. He was here this morning. I guess he's still here tonight. Yeah, I see him standing over here, Brother Brewer. I promised to come by and dedicate their churches, so many times. I'll get there some day, by the help of the Lord, as I can. Now, while we sing this next verse now. At the Name of Jesus bowing, Falling prostrate at His feet, 65-0822E, A Thinking Man's Filter, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 114 min King of kings in Heaven we'll crown Him, When our journey is complete. Let's sing it now. At the Name of Jesus bowing, Falling prostrate at His feet, King of kings in Heaven we'll crown Him, When our journey is complete. Precious Name (precious Name), O how sweet! (O how sweet!) Hope of earth and joy of Heaven; Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven. Oh, take the Name of Jesus with you, As a shield from every snare; (listen now) Oh, when temptations round you gather, (what must you do?) Just breathe that holy Name in prayer. Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven; Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven. Let us bow our heads. O precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven; Precious Name (baptized in It; pray in It), O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven. Brother Martin.

Lord Jesus, the Shepherd of the great Flock, we are so in debt to Thee, Lord, that we could never pay Thee for the love that Thou has shed abroad in our hearts. We feel so unworthy as we bow our heads and stand in Thy presence. We ask You to cleanse us from all faults and all sin. We pray that You'll strengthen our bodies today. Many are sick and afflicted, as it shows here, of handkerchiefs and requests coming in on the phone and everywhere.\n\nL-2 And we believe that we are ending up this world's history now, and soon time will fade into Eternity, and we want to be ready for that hour. And that's why we have assembled here this morning, is to prepare for that time. I am told that there are many of the telephone hooks-ups this morning across the nation, from coast to coast. Wherever our voices is coming, may that little group be blessed. Heal the sick that's among them, and I pray that You'll cleanse their souls from all evil. And help us here this morning, at the tabernacle, that we also may enjoy that great privilege.\n\nL-3 And we ask that You'll speak to us today through Thy written Word, and may the Spirit reveal to us the things that we have need of, as we have gathered nationwide now, feeling that we are a small people, but have a place among the redeemed, because we have believed on Jesus Christ. Grant these things to us, Lord.\n\nL-4 And when we close the service and we go to our different homes across the nation, may we say, like those from Emmaus, \"Did not our hearts burn within us as He spoke to us along the road?\"\n\nL-5 Now, Father, I know that whatever I would say would be certainly insufficient, with the--the fine Christians throughout the nation now that's tuned in, it wouldn't be--it wouldn't be adequate. It would not be something that I could say that could do any good, because we're all in the same category. We're human, mortals. But let the great Holy Spirit speak; may He take a hold of the Word and just reveal Himself. We're waiting on Him now, in Jesus' Name. Amen. You may be seated.\n\nL-6 I kinda... surprising myself. I told my wife, if she happens to be listening in, down in Tucson, that I didn't think I'd have any service when I come back; and I didn't even bring clothes. And I said to my daughter-in-law, she had pressed my coat, and I said, \"I'm staying behind the pulpit, with... They don't know the trousers is one kind and the coat's another.\" It's the ones I wore home. But, Meda, she got my shirt ironed and everything, so every... Don't worry; everything is fine.\n\nL-7 Now, we have a request here, that there's a very dear brother... And I think that--that Prescott, I believe, is hooked in this morning, up in--in Prescott, Arizona. Sister Mercier's father is just been on his road here to the meeting, I understand, and was had to be taken to the hospital in a heart attack, Brother Coggins. And, also, Brother Junior Jackson, I think he's in on the next radio down, or the next phone down in Clarksville or New Albany, and his father is in the hospital, I understand, with serious operation of cancer in the liver. So we want certainly remember those in our prayers. And now there's others here, too, but we don't want to take up the time. God knows all about them, so let us pray for them now.\n\nL-8 Dear God, as that dear, old, wrinkled-hand man, Brother Coggins, an old veteran of the field, has... laying in the hospital this morning, somewhere, suffering from an attack on his heart. God, that poor old heart's went through much troubles. I pray, God, to help him. Grant it. He like... He loves life like all of us does, and he wants to live. Lord God, grant it. We across the nation pray in Jesus' Name for him, that You'll heal him and bring him out. We believe that You will; he'll be come right to the meeting.\n\nL-9 We pray for Brother Jackson, his precious daddy laying there near death now, and bring in the world a fine boy like Junior. I--I--I pray, dear God, that You'll heal him. I know it seems impossible. The medics, the doctors, they--they don't know what to do in that kind of a case. But we remember Brother Hall, also, when the very best of the physicians 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min here said, in Louisville, said, \"He's just a few hours to live,\" with cancer in the liver. And he's living today, and that's twenty-five years ago, because of Your grace. So I pray that You'll heal Brother Jackson today, Lord, let Your grace and mercy be with him.\n\nL-10 And all this great pile of handkerchiefs and cloths and things that's placed here in request; You know them all, Father. I pray that You'll grant healing to all of them. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-11 Now start, this morning, I didn't think that I was going to come down, at the first place, last Sunday. And then again, when we announced it, I come down. Brother Neville had me to speak! And then we announced to be down today, and it hasn't been notified out around the country to the peoples. And we got this telephone system now, which is very, very fine. The people can set right in their homes or their... gather in their places, their churches, and so forth, and hear the service. I appreciate that.\n\nL-12 Now I see laying here, there had been many requests this last week, on what I said last Sunday on the Message. I believe I forget what I titled it now. But I said something about paying your debts. And you know, no matter what you say, it's misunderstood by many. Not 'cause they... they don't want to misunderstand it, but you just simply misunderstand it. And now someone said, \"Should we buy a car?\" Or, \"What should I...\" Now, that isn't what Jesus spoke of, or the Bible there, that said, \"Owe no man nothing.\" That's lingering debts that you could pay. Pay them. It don't... That's owing no man nothing. It doesn't mean... My, we owe our rent, our telephone bill, we... and whatmore. We--we owe those things, and we pay them. But, an old lingering debt that you could be paying on, pay it off. See? Now, don't go with anything hanging on you like that. [Romans 13:8]\n\nL-13 I remember a time when I was sick, once when I was a boy. I came out of the hospital owing about two thousand dollars. And used to be a drugstore here, Mr. Swaniger, I owed him about three or four hundred dollars, a medicine bill. He didn't even know me. And the man... I went to him. I didn't know him. And he just send it up there, anyhow, never refused to send it. And I said, \"I owe you.\"And I said... I believe, Swaniger... It was Mr. Mason down on Court Avenue and Spring. And I said, \"I owe you. And I'm--I'm just still awfully weak, but I'm trying to go to work. Now, if I can't pay you...\" I just become a Christian. I said, \"First thing, Mr. Mason, as my duty to God, I owe Him my tithes. I want to pay Him my tithings, first.\" And I said, \"Then my next duty is pay my debts.\" I said, \"My father is sickly, and he... And we got... There's ten of us children in the family.\" But I said, \"I'll... If I can't pay you no more than twenty-five cents on that bill, each payday; if I can't pay you even the twenty-five cents, I'll come by and tell you about it. I'll tell you, 'I--I--I can't do it this time.'\" Now, by the help of God, I paid every bit off. See? But that's what I mean, see? Just don't somebody say...\n\nL-14 Oh, some Christian here at the church one time went out and got some work done on a car here, and the man come down... The man said, \"I'll pay you. I get paid Saturday,\" or something another. And he never paid him. And weeks after weeks rolled by, and never paid him, never said a word. And--and the man come and asked me, he said... See, it reflects against the church. It reflects against Christ. You can't pay him, go tell him, say, \"I owe you, and I'm going to pay you. I'm a Christian, but I--I just... I can't do it right now, I've got... I owe this.\" And, remember, it's on God's books too, you know, that you do. So that's... I'm trying to, for myself and for all of us together, try to be ready, for we know we're getting near something, very near of something is going to take place. So we want to be ready. When the Coming of the Lord is drawing so nigh now, we want to be ready for that great hour. [Romans 13:8]\n\nL-15 Now we want to get ready and speak now on a little subject here that I chose for this morning, by the help of the Lord. And we'll speak just as briefly as we can, because of the hook-up of the people. I hope you all got a... all across the nation, got a fine morning like we have here in Indiana. Nice, cool, fine weather we're having now since the rain. And it's very fine.\n\nL-16 Now I want to read from the Book of Hebrews, the 1st chapter; and from the Book of Saint John, the lst chapter. Hebrews 1:1 to 3, and Saint John 1:1, for a text. My subject this morning is a study in the Scriptures. Now let's read Hebrews 1:1. 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min God, who at sundry times... divers manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets, But in these last days spoken to us by his Son, who he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world; Who being in the brightness of his glory, and... express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; [Hebrews 1:1-4] What a beautiful reading! Now Saint John 1:1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [John 1:1]\n\nL-17 Now, and my text this morning is: Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word. Now, where I come to the conclusion to talk on this, was because that... Knowing that what we say we mustn't just say because we're gathered together to just haphazardly speak on anything, but it's something that will help stabilize the people, for we are going to pass through dangerous, treacherous waters. We're already sailing through them. And sometimes I guess it's with you like it is with me, that seems like that, so much of it, it's such a scary.\n\nL-18 I was just talking to a young minister and his wife, in the room, just a few moments ago. And both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world, rest of the human beings on earth. I said, \"Remember, Satan's got a punch coming at you.\" Don't care who you are, God... He's got a right for that one punch. Which had you rather be, that punch; be blind, or be an arthritic setting in a chair, or be nervous? See? He's got somewhere he can punch you. He's got a right to that open place. Now, that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time. And to see this nervous age that we're living in!\n\nL-19 And last week's tapes, I think, will reveal to you the great hideous things that we're going to speak on one of these days when we can get a place sufficient, of the opening of those last plagues to be poured out upon the earth, those Vials, rather, pouring out of the Vials, and the Seven Thunders, and those hideous sights that's coming upon the earth. Man now, and people today, are in such a neurotic condition; the whole world!\n\nL-20 You read this last month's Reader's Digest, you'll notice the subject there; it's on Billy Graham, the great evangelist. He got so tired he just couldn't hold his meetings, and he--he went to Mayo's clinic for a physical checkup. There wasn't nothing wrong with him, only he just doesn't do enough work. And they put him to running; physical exercise. He runs a mile every day. And then the article goes on to say that science has proved that today, that young children, these little boys and girls, \"hit their middle age at twenty years old.\" And by twenty-five, many times, in many cases, girls are out of menopause, at twenty-five years old. I don't know if you knew it or not, but a few nights ago while the Holy Spirit was speaking here in the meeting, a little girl setting down here, that's exactly what was wrong with that child when it called out. I looked at her the second time, looked again, and I seen what was the matter. I thought, \"It can't be; that child is too young.\" But it was menopause, about twenty years old, twenty-three, something like that. See?\n\nL-21 My mother and your mother struck that age about forty-five to fifty. My wife struck that age about thirty-five. Now it's down to twenty. The whole human race is rotten. Well, if them physical beings of our body is tearing down like that from eating hybrid foods, tensions, that rotten it, does not that also rot the brain cell? Then we can see how women can get on the street, naked. We can see how they can speed through the--the streets at a hundred and twenty miles an hour, all these things. It's come to a place where the whole nation, the whole world, not only this nation, but everywhere, mentally gone.\n\nL-22 And then when we open up those, the Lord willing, on those Seven Vials and show those hideous things. Men will be so insane, after a while, till they'll imagine they're seeing ants the size of a mountain. It'll be tormenting women; be locusts come upon the earth, with long hair, to torment women who cut theirs off; hair like women, hanging down; and long teeth, like a lion; stingers in their tail, like a scorpion, and--and so forth, to torment men upon the earth. But then it'll be too late to do anything about it. You get right now. Tormenting! [Revelation 15:7], [Revelation 17:1], [Revelation 21:9] 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min\n\nL-23 And last Sunday when we was going into those cycles, about how that the five senses on the outer realm. That's the inlet, five senses to the body. There's only one way you can get into the body, that's by those five senses: see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. There's no other way to contact the--the body.\n\nL-24 On the inside of that man is a man called spirit, and he has five senses: think, thought... and thought, and love, and conscience, and so forth. All right.\n\nL-25 Now, you can't think with your body. You think with your mind. And in there is where too many, of Christians, only stop. And they can, just like the corn in the field and the weed in the field, they can be anointed with the same Holy Spirit that the real believer is anointed with. But down on the inside of that, next realm, the third realm, is the soul; and that's predestinated by God. There is where the real seed-germ lays, is in there.\n\nL-26 And, remember, if I'd take a cocklebur and cut it open, draft into it the heart of a--of a wheat and put it there, bury it, it would bring forth a wheat out of the cocklebur; no matter what the outside is, what the emotions.\n\nL-27 Today, so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost, and so forth. Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift that God has got, but he cannot bring that Word, Word by Word. That's where he failed in the garden of Eden. That's where he's always failed. That's where them, the tape on \"false, anointed ones,\" or anointed ones; they can be anointed with the Spirit, speak in tongues, dance, shout, preach the Gospel, and still a devil. It's the inside! Now remember, Jesus said, \"All the Father has given Me will come to Me. No man can come except My Father draws him first.\" Now, we taken through the lesson, to show that in... You were in your great-great-great-grandfather, all the way back, physically speaking. Then, that's what you are in physical being, nature. Sometimes a child will be born in a family, red-headed. It astonishes the father, 'cause there's nobody he knows, of his people, red-headed, or the mother's. But if you'll go way back to several generations, you'll find out somebody was red-headed. That seed keeps coming on down, and you come the nature of one from way back. Like as Hebrews the 7th chapter said, that, \"Melchisedec, Abraham paid tithes to Him when he was returning from the slaughter of the kings. And Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes,\" for he was in the loins of Melchisedec at... or, \"the loins of Abraham,\" rather, when he met Melchisedec. [John 6:65], [John 6:37], [Hebrews 7:1-2]\n\nL-28 Now the same thing is this. If you are a son of God, and if I am a son of God, or a daughter of God, we were in God at the beginning. And when Jesus became the fullness of the Word, then we were in Him, germ form. When He was crucified, we was crucified in His body. When He arose from the dead, we rose with Him. And now, since we have recognized it, \"now we set together with Him, in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\" See? For He... We, if we are sons and daughters of God, we are God's children, then we are attributes of God. Then we were... got Eternal Life. And God is the only Eternal Life there is. Then, we were in Him from the beginning. And when Jesus became all that Word, then we were a part of Him then. Amen! There you are. When that's in there, there is no devil, no powers, no nothing can ever move it. That's the tie post of the soul. [Ephesians 2:6]\n\nL-29 You can be anointed out here, in this spirit, and desire, and do all these other things. But when it comes to this tie post to that Word, you'll never move from there. It'll hold right steady and true, to that Word, as it can be. Outside of that, regardless of what you do, you're still lost.\n\nL-30 That Laodicean Church Age, \"naked, blind, miserable; don't even know it.\" See, it's out... It's that anointed, anointed with the real Spirit. See, that Holy Spirit can fall upon a man, in his spirit. But his soul is his germ; that germ is the Word. See? And how... I don't care how much you can preach, how well you do this, and how much you love; that's one of the inlets to spirit. You can't love with your body; you love with your spirit. That's one of the inlets. And you can love, and even love God, and still not be right. You can cast out devils, and preach, and do these things; still not be right. Jesus said so, said many would come in that day. That Word settles it! In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us,... [John 1:1, 14] 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min\n\nL-31 Notice, I'm going to speak on this subject of the Bible, of, Christ Revealed In His Own Word. Where I drawed this conclusion, was in my room. Some dear person, may be setting here this morning... I got a picture hanging in my study up there, that's a picture of Hofmann's Head of Christ, wrote in the Beatitudes. And right where you would come to place like you need a part of the hair, they pressed a little harder on the pen as you pass that part. There, there He is, setting in His Word, looking right out; Christ in the Beatitudes. Someone, ever who it was, I thank you for it. And somebody brought that picture and put it in my study there, of Elijah going up in a chariot of fire. We appreciate these things. Many times, big crowds, I just don't get a chance to speak and say these things, but I see it, brother, sister. I--I know it, and God knows it.\n\nL-32 Now I'm going to speak on this subject of: Christ Revealed In His Own Word. How, in the Beatitudes, there stands a picture of Christ, standing right out, like. That's where I thought of this subject. Now, Christ and the Word is the same. See?\n\nL-33 They say, \"How was the Bible...?\" People says. I was riding with a man not long ago. He said, \"Think of it. We here on this earth, the way we are, and we only know or can only say that we're saved by some Jewish fable called the Bible.\"\n\nL-34 I said, \"Sir, I don't know how you say that, but I don't believe it's a Jewish fable,\" I said. He said, \"Well, you pray, what do you pray to? I asked for so-and-so and certain things; I didn't get it.\"\n\nL-35 I said, \"You pray wrong. We should never pray to change God's mind; we should pray to change our mind. God's mind don't need any changing. See? See, it's right.\" I said, \"Not what you prayed for...\" I know a young Catholic boy, one time, was had a prayer book, saying prayers, and for his mother to live. And she died, and he throwed the prayer book in the fire. Well, see, I don't go for the prayer book; but, anyhow, see, you take the wrong attitude. You're trying to tell God what to do. Prayer should be, \"Lord, change me to fit Your Word.\" Not, \"Change,\" not, \"let me change Your mind. You change my mind.\" See? \"You change my mind to Your will. And Your will is written here in the Book. And, Lord, don't--don't let me go till You got my--my mind set just like Your mind. And then when my mind is set like Your mind, then I'll believe every Word You wrote. And You said, in there, You'd make 'everything work together for good' to them that loves You. And I love You, Lord. It's all working together for the good.\" [Romans 8:28]\n\nL-36 I been this week down in the country, staying with some very dear friends. I asked some of them at the table, yesterday, when we was eating. We always set around and have a little... like a little study on the Bible. We was talking about love. And there was a certain person said to me, he said, \"I believe you're an antichrist.\"\n\nL-37 I said, \"If that would be pleasing to my Lord, that's what I want to be. I want to be whatever He wants me to be. I love Him. And if He should cast me into hell, I still will love Him, if I go with the same spirit I have now.\" He looked at me kinda strange. I seen four or five of them there, young men; young wives, fine women. I knowed how them boys loved their wives, so I said to them, I said, \"Here is the way to test it. If your wife, before you were married... Now, you go back, say you... this married life, you been dreaming you were married; you really wasn't married, but you dreamed you were. And you woke up, and you went and talked it over with your girl friend, and said, 'You know, I dreamed that we were married, and we had children. We living happy, and--and waiting for the Coming of the Lord, and everything.' And then this girl would say to you, 'You know, I love another man better than I love you. I could be happier with the other man.' Could you, from your heart, love her well enough to say, 'God's blessings rest upon you, my dear. Go with this other man'?\" Now, now check that, each of you men or you women. See? Well, if your love is correct, you would do that, for you are interested in her welfare. What, you know you could have her, you can live with her, you... She's your wife; she will be. She'll marry you, but she won't be happy. She would be happier... And then, if you love her, then you want her to be happy. Therefore, whatever the will of God is, let God's will be done, whether I'm happy with it or not. I want to live so He 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min will be pleased with what I do. Therefore check your--your objective and your motive by that; you know whether you love God or not. What if He'd say, \"You serve Me if I'm going to cast you away?\" \"I love You, anyhow.\"\n\nL-38 Therefore, if the churches would see that and could believe it in that manner, it wouldn't be one trying to jerk the football away from the other fellow when he's running with it. He would be protecting that one. See? When, real true motive and objective, wouldn't be one trying to say, \"Hey, I got this too! I, this is me, this.\" See, God can't use a man. There is so much impersonation follows it, and that's Satan. And the people can't realize that. They're trying to take the ball from somebody that's been give it. Let God raise up a certain ministry and watch how many goes after it. See? See?\n\nL-39 Now, genuine love for God, \"No matter what part I am, Lord, if I can only say a word for It, help protect It, let me do that.\" See? That's the same thing would be about your wife. If you really love her, see, it's not a--it's not a--a phileo love; it's an Agapao love, a genuine love. She could live with somebody else, happier; you're not married now, course, you can't.\n\nL-40 And, by the way, people listening to these tapes. Some, so many, sends in, said, \"Why, in the Marriage And Divorce, you said this and you said that.\" I said that so many times; these tapes goes only... I'm speaking to my congregation, brother. I'm not responsible for what God give you to shepherd; I'm responsible for what kind of Food I feed these people. This is for this tabernacle only. See? Now, if the people want to listen to the tapes, that's up to them. But I'm speaking to what God has give to me. It was their sins that was omitted. Someone wrote out, and said, \"Well, I done this and I done that. You said our sins...\" I--I didn't say that. I said, \"See it to this; this is only to this people right here, the people here in the tabernacle, my own flock.\" Now, if people wants to hybreed food and stuff out there, you--you get the revelation from God and do what God tells you to do. I'll do the same thing. But these Messages are to this church.\n\nL-41 Notice now, we come back, we've got to have something another that we have to hold onto. Something has to be a tie post, in other words, it's an ultimate. And everyone must have an ultimate or an absolute. I preached on it one time, years ago, on an absolute, a place that's the last word.\n\nL-42 Like the umpire at a ball game, if he says it's a strike, that's just exactly what it is. No matter how you seen it, the umpire said it's a strike. You said, \"I--I--I... It wasn't a strike. It went... I seen the...\" No matter what it is, when he said, \"strike,\" that's it, that settle just what. He, he is the ultimate.\n\nL-43 And the traffic light is an ultimate, if it says, \"go.\" You say, \"Well, I, I'm in a hurry, I got...\" No, no. It says, \"You stand still while the other fellow goes.\" See? It's the ultimate.\n\nL-44 Now, there's got to be an ultimate to everything you do. There had to be an ultimate when you chose your wife. There had to be a woman you had to select.\n\nL-45 Now, there has to be a time where, when you're going to buy a car, what kind of an ultimate you're going to make. Will it be Ford, Chevy, Plymouth, foreign car, whatever it is, you got to have an ultimate. And so is it with Christian living. There has got to be an ultimate.\n\nL-46 Now, if a man said, went to another man and said... heard somebody say, \"Well, you should be baptized,\" and this fellow never... Maybe, his, some church that didn't baptize, they just sprinkled. I think, say for instance, the Methodist, they do baptize if it's requested, I understand. Or maybe the... A Catholic, I think they sprinkle only. So then if--if a man heard something about being \"immersed in the water,\" well, he didn't understand that; he was raised Catholic. So he goes up to the priest, and said, \"Father, I understand that we're supposed to be baptized by immersing. What does our church say about that?\"\n\nL-47 \"Why, it says that--that we're to be sprinkled.\" If that church is his ultimate, that settles it. All strife is over; the church said so, and that's all.\n\nL-48 What if the... if a Baptist brother heard us say that we believe in being baptized by \"immersing\"? He'd say, \"I believe that.\" 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min \"And in the Name of 'Jesus Christ.'\" Now, this--this member of the church goes back to the pastor and says, \"Pastor, I heard a fellow say to me that we should be baptized by immersing, all right, but in the Name of 'Jesus Christ.'\"\n\nL-49 \"Well,\" he'd say, \"now, let us see. Why, here the book says that we're to be baptized using 'Father, Son, Holy Ghost.'\" If that church is the ultimate, that settles it. He don't care about what anything else says; that's his ultimate.\n\nL-50 Well, every denomination is an ultimate to their believers. But, to me, and to the ones that I hope that I'm leading to Christ, and by Christ, the Bible is our ultimate. No matter... Cause, God said, \"Let every man's word be a lie, and Mine Truth.\" And I believe that the Bible is God's ultimate. No matter what anyone else says; It's the ultimate. The Bible is not a book of systems. No, sir. It is not a book of systems, nor a code of morals. The Bible is not a book of systems, so many systems, and so forth. No, sir. It is not a book of morals. No, sir. It is not. Nor is It a book of history, altogether. Or, neither is It a book of theology. For, It is the revelation of Jesus Christ. Now if you'd like to read that, you who have your papers, marking it down, that's Revelations 1:1 to 3, as, the Bible is \"the Revelation of Jesus Christ.\" [Revelation 1:1-3]\n\nL-51 Let us just read it while we got time. I believe my... haven't got too many notes here to speak from. If the Lord tarries, why, we'll try to get from them. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signify it by his angel to his servant John: Who bare record of the word of God, and... the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the word of this prophecy, and keep the things which are written therein: for the time is at hand. [Revelation 1:1-3]\n\nL-52 So, the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ. And It was wrote by prophets. Hebrews 1:1, in... \"God, Who in sundry times spake to the fathers by the prophets, in this last day speaks to us through His Son, Jesus Christ,\" which was the prophets, all of them, put together. Jesus was Malachi; Jesus was Jeremiah, Isaiah, Elijah. All that they were, were in Him. And all that you are, and all I am, is in Him; Words, witnesses of the Word. So It is not a book of systems, a code of moral ethics, neither is It a history book, or a book of theology. It is not. But It's a revelation of Jesus Christ, God Himself revealed, from Word to flesh. That's what It is. The Bible is the Word, and God is the flesh, God in... God is the Word, rather, and Jesus being the flesh. It's the revelation, how God (the Word) was manifested in human flesh, and revealed to us. And that's why He becomes a Son of God; He is a part of God. You understand? Now, He is not... The body is part of God, so much that it's a Son. [Revelation 1:1-3], [Hebrews 1:1]\n\nL-53 A Son, as the Catholic puts it, \"Eternal Son,\" and all the rest of the churches; the word don't even make sense. See? There cannot be Eternal, and then be a Son, 'cause a Son is something that's \"begotten from.\" And the word Eternal, He cannot be an Eter-... He can be a Son, but He cannot be an Eternal Son. No, sir. It cannot be an Eternal Son.\n\nL-54 Now, but He is the Son, so much, that all the Word that was in Jeremiah, in Moses, and all those Words, like He said, \"They speak of Me.\" All that true Divine revelation of Word was wound up into one human body, and God put flesh around It. That's the reason He was called \"Son,\" reason He refers, \"Father.\" Why, it's just as simple, if you just let God pour it down into your mind. See? God revealed in a body of flesh, notice, revealed from flesh... or from Word unto flesh. That's Saint John 1:14, \"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\" [John 1:14]\n\nL-55 Now notice this Bible. Some of them said, \"Oh, well, It's done this, It's done that.\" But let me tell you something, let's just... Let's go into the history of the Bible, just a minute, see where It come from. It was written by forty different writers. Forty men wrote the Bible, over a space of sixteen hundred years apart, and at different times, predicting the most important events that ever happened in world's history, and, many times, hundreds of years before it happened. And there is not one error in the entire sixty-six Books. Oh, my! No author but God Himself could be so accurate. Not one Word contradicts the other. 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min Remember, sixteen hundred years apart, the Bible was wrote, from Moses to--to the death of--of John at the isle, or the Isle of Patmos. Sixteen hundred years, and was wrote by forty different authors; one didn't even know the other one, and they never had It as \"the Word.\" Some of them never even seen \"the Word.\" But when they wrote It, and was understood to be prophets, then, when they put their prophecies together, each one of them dovetailed one to the other. [Revelation 1:9]\n\nL-56 Look at Peter, who announced on the Day of Pentecost, \"Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins.\" Paul had never heard nothing about It. He went down to Arabia for three years, to study the Old Testament, to see Who this Pillar of Fire was that spoke to him on the road, saying, \"Saul, why persecutest thou Me?\" How could he be wrong? He never even consulted the church at all. And fourteen years later, when he met Peter, they was preaching the same thing, Word by Word. That's our Bible. Let other man's words fail. This, no man can add to It. You don't add no more to the Bible. No, sir. This is the complete Revelation. It's all. [Acts 2:38], [Acts 9:4]\n\nL-57 Like the Seven Seals. \"The Seven Seals,\" someone kept saying to me, \"now you'll... The Lord will speak to you, Brother Branham, when these Seals are revealed, and will tell us how to get closer to God, and how to do it.\"\n\nL-58 I said, \"No, sir, it can't be. Because, the Bible, the Seven Seals on It had the seven mysteries hid. It was already wrote, but they didn't understand what It was.\" Watch how they plowed along with that, being baptized in \"Jesus\" Name; see, that wasn't it. The Name of the \"Lord Jesus Christ\"! See all those things, how it was. Cause, there's many Jesuses; I got several friends here on earth named \"Jesus,\" minister friends. It isn't that. It's our \"Lord Jesus Christ.\" No author but God could be so correct. Now let's just see how this Bible was written. [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-59 Now, say for instance, from... What if we went now and took sixty-six medical books that deals with the body, wrote by forty different medical schools, a hundred and sixteen... or sixteen hundred years apart? Wonder what kind of continuity we'd come up with? When, George Washington, our president, about two hundred years ago, for pneumonia, they pulled his toenail out and bled him a pint. What if we took...\n\nL-60 Let's go a little further, on some things that we so attracted to today, that's science. What if we took forty different science, from sixteen hundred years apart, and see what we'd come up with? A French scientist, three hundred years ago, proved by science, by rolling a ball, that, if any terrific speed was obtained over thirty miles an hour, the object would leave the earth and fall off. Do you think science would ever refer back to that? Is any continuity with that now, when they drive down the street, on the road here, a hundred and fifty miles an hour? See? But he scientifically proved that, by the pressure of the ball rolling across the ground, that at thirty miles an hour, that, any object would lift up off the earth and go away, it'd fall off into space. No, there's no continuity to that.\n\nL-61 But not one Word in the Bible contradicts the other. Not one prophet ever contradicted the other one. They was, every one, perfect. And when one come in and did prophesy, and that real prophet raised up and called him down, then it was made manifest. See? See? So the Bible is the Word of God, to all true believers.\n\nL-62 Now, you couldn't get no accuracy in what doctors would agree upon. You can't even get accuracy of them now. You can't get accuracy in science now. Now, you know, sometime ago, they told us that the... that, \"When the Bible said that 'he saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the earth,' that that couldn't be. The earth was round.\" But the Bible said, \"four corners.\" Well, now you seen, two weeks ago, or three weeks ago, it's been now, the papers packing this article, they found out that the world is square. How many seen that? Why, sure. See? I got it all copied off, just waiting for somebody to say something. [Revelation 7:1]\n\nL-63 And they're going to find out, someday, that they're not seeing a hundred and fifty million years of light space either. They're going right around in a circle. That's exactly. 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min You're going to find out, one of these days, that when you go to Heaven, you don't fly off somewhere else. You're still right here, too, just in another dimension faster than this. Right through this room is coming color. Every color, shirt, dress, whatever you got on, is Eternal, laying right on records, going around and around the world. Every time you bat your eyes, it's right on record. Watch, television will prove that.\n\nL-64 When you are born, God sets a record on. It don't make... Put a record on, it don't make much noise for a little while, you know. That's the little baby, till it comes to accountability; then the noise starts, he starts saying things and doing things he has to answer for. And then when that life ends, that record or tape is took off and laid in the--in the great big library of God. Now, how you going to get around it at the Judgment Bar? It's played right back in front of you, every move you made, every thought that went through your mind. Can you see that? Now can you see where God...\n\nL-65 Standing here, other night, there been a man on the platform, tall, bald-headed man, real handsome-looking fellow, strong. And he went out... The Lord had told him a whole lot of things about his family and what he should do. And he went out and set down. In a few minutes, here come before me another man like that, but he had his head down. I couldn't make out, and I looked at the man again out there; and he... Wasn't him, because it was something else. And this man, I couldn't find it. Looked around, no body behind, me. I said, \"The man is setting inside of those curtains there.\" And it was our... a brother that comes to church here, tall, bald-headed, handsome sort of a fellow setting up there like that. And he had his head hung over, praying, because he was just about to die with stomach trouble. He was going to get a pair of shoes. His wife wanted him to get a new pair of shoes. He said, \"No, I don't have to get it, 'cause I ain't going to live to wear them.\" He was dying. And setting there, you see, in that dimension, hallelujah, God just moved over in there and said, \"There he sets,\" just the position he was in. See what I mean?\n\nL-66 Now notice, and there is not any error in the Scriptures. Jesus, the Word of God, perceives the thought that's in the heart. \"The Word of God is stronger, sharper,\" Hebrews 4:12. \"The Word of God is sharper, more powerful than a two-edged sword, even a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the mind.\" See? Goes way down into the mind, and pulls out, and discerns. What is discern? \"Make known, reveal out.\" And that's what the Word of God does. Today we say, \"The Catholic church is the Word of God; the Baptists, the Methodists, the Pentecostal, the tabernacle.\" That's wrong. The Word is the revelation; God, revealed by the Word. [Hebrews 4:12]\n\nL-67 No, we could have got... get any continuity amongst medics, amongst scientists, different ones. If Einstein had only had the spiritual application, as he had the--the physical application, as he studied the laws of light, and so forth, he could have told us something. When I heard his message on that great center somewhere into the skies, that, \"Ever contacted with that center, you could create earths, do anything, and the power would be unlimited.\" See? He had seen that.\n\nL-68 You see these little pockets going through the air, they call \"saucers,\" so forth. People so... That, well, we better leave that alone. \"Hear all these people come up missing?\" you say. Don't hear from them; they're standing there, and they're not there. That's the way the Rapture is going to be. One of them will drop right down, and this terrestrial body will take on a celestial body. And they'll be... hide, hair, or bones left; it'll be transformed in a moment of time, dropping right out of space and taking Home that. We see all this going on now, and the--and the Pentagon wondering about these lights, and mystic lights, and everything they're seeing in the--in the sky. You seen they had one here in the paper at Jeffersonville this week, and so forth, \"a mystic light.\" So, oh, they don't know what that is. But listen, little children, It's going to pick you up, one of these days. See? See? Don't worry. Remember, Jesus said, \"As it was in the days of Sodom.\" [I Thessalonians 4:16-18], [Luke 17:28]\n\nL-69 What happened just before Sodom? God came down with some Angels, and they had an investigation judgment. Said, \"I've heard the cry, that it's so sinful, so great, so I've come down to find out whether it's altogether the truth or not.\" That right? Watch that main One that stayed with Abraham, could discern the thoughts was in Sarah's heart, 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min behind Him. Now, you look around just a little bit and notice, see, watch what It's doing, the same thing today. It's an investigation judgment. Why, after a while, the Church, when It can stay in that place, and every seed has been brought to its spot, they'll be gone. They won't know what happened to them. One will be going one way. See? One will be going over to the pastor's house, and one will be going here, or down there, and, the first thing you know, they're not there. For Enoch which was the type, \"God took him, and he was found not.\" Come down to investigate! The continuity, how the Enoch translation, a type. Of Israel being carried over in the ark... [Luke 17:28], [Genesis 19:1-10]\n\nL-70 So perfect, the Word of God is so perfect, even to the Old and New Testament, is two halves and one whole. That's right. Old Testament is half of It, and New Testament is half of It; put It together, you got the whole revelation of Jesus Christ. There is the prophets speaking, and here He is in Person; see, two halves and one whole. Now we don't want to take too much...\n\nL-71 Now, remember, the Old Testament is not complete without the New. And the New could not be complete without the Old. That's the reason I said two halves, one whole. For, the prophets said, \"He'll be here! He'll be here! He'll be here; they'll do this to Him. They'll do this to Him!\" And here He is, \"He was here! He was here, and they did this to Him, and they did this to Him.\" I just preached on that a few nights ago.\n\nL-72 Now, in order to study the Scripture, Paul told Timothy, \"Study It, rightly dividing the Word of God, which is Truth.\" Them is three musts in the Scripture. In using God's Word, there is three things that you must not do. Now let's study those for the next ten minutes; three things that you must not do. And all out in the land, wherever you are, across the nation, be sure to put these down in your mind if you haven't got a pencil. You must not do these things. We tell you all the time how you must do, now I'm going to tell you what you must not do. [II Timothy 2:15]\n\nL-73 Now, you must not misinterpret the Word. You say, \"Well, I believe It means this.\" It means just what It says. It needs no interpreter. And you must not misplace the Word. And you must not dislocate the Word. And if we would do either of these, it throws the whole Bible in a confusion and in a chaos.\n\nL-74 Notice. To misinterpret Jesus, in the form of God in a man, you would make Him--you would make Him one God out of three. To misinterpret Jesus Christ being the Word, you would make Him one God out of three, or you would make Him the second Person in a Godhead. And to do that, you would mess the whole Scripture up. You'd never get nowhere. So It must not be misinterpreted.\n\nL-75 And if you say that a certain thing, you put an interpretation on It, and you apply It to another time; or It's been applied to another time, you also make an incorrect interpreting.\n\nL-76 If anybody misinterpret Jesus Christ in the Bible, of not being God Himself, make Him the second Person, or one God out of three, this would upset every Word in the entire Bible. It would break the first commandment, \"Thou shalt not have any other god before Me.\" All right. It would make the whole Christian race a bunch of pagan worshippers worshipping three different gods. See what kind of a Bible you'd have? Then it'd make us what the Jews say we are. Said, \"Which one of them gods is your God?\" See? So, you see, you can't... You mustn't misinterpret the Bible. For, Jesus Himself is the interpretation of the Bible, when He's made manifest in the age that the part of His Body is being made manifest. If it's a hand age, it must be a hand; it can't be a head age. If it's a voice age, well, then, it can't be a foot age. See? And now we're at the eye age. And now the next, is Him Hisself, to come. Seeing; prophetic! [Exodus 20:3]\n\nL-77 See, down through the age, we started off from the foundation, from the first church age; when the Seed went in the ground, the complete Seed. Then it come out through the feet, Luther; come back out then through Wesley; then in to Pentecostals, the tongues, in the lips, see; now it's in the eyes, prophetic, of Malachi 4, and so forth. And now there's nothing else left for it to come but Him Himself to step into that, 'cause that's the last thing there is. The next is the intelligence, and we have no intelligence of our own; it's His. We have no sight of our own. How can a 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min man foresee those things? He can't do it. It's God Himself. See, it's--it's becoming to a place. And He's governed the body all the way through, then the complete Body of Christ is revealed in the form of a Bride that was taken out of His side, like Adam did at the beginning... like Adam's was, rather, at the beginning.\n\nL-78 Yes, \"god,\" this would set the whole Bible in a confusion, break the first commandment, and make a god, a pagan god of three. It would just--it would just ruin the whole picture of the Bible. So you must not misinterpret the Bible. Now, that's just one thing.\n\nL-79 When, every Scripture in the Bible has the same application, you've got to set It in Its place. And to misplace It, you might make Him God in one age, and--and the next age you'd make Him a history, to misplace It. So you mustn't misplace the Scripture. He is God all the time. If you made Him today a God of history, what was back yonder, and He isn't the same today, what are you going to do with Hebrews 13:8? See, \"He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\"\n\nL-80 Now, so see what this would do, and what it has done. It's already done it, make Him deny His Own Word, to misplace the Scriptures.\n\nL-81 To dislocate the Scriptures, you might put His body together wrong, the foot where the head should be, or something. Just the same as a... Other words, you might have Jesus teaching Moses' message. You might have... or even Wesley teaching Luther's age. You might have now, our age, teaching Pentecost, the Pentecostal message. You see what a mess It would be in? Pentecost has already showed its colors. Luther has already showed his, went off into denomination. It died right there. The age struck; there it went.\n\nL-82 Notice, just as soon as it was organized, it died. Now, just see if that isn't right. Look back through the pages of history. Every time it organized, it died right there; there never was no more to it. It become a--a worshiper of the god of this world, and went off into organisms, and organizations, and denominations, and illusions. A bunch of Rickys got into there and put their own objections into it, or injected their own thoughts, rather, into it. And what did it happen? It become a mess. Going to head up in the god of this world, where they'll throne Satan himself, thinking that they're having a great world leader to bring them peace.\n\nL-83 I told you the other day, I'll say it again, that even civilization itself today is absolutely contrary to God. Civilization is contrary to God. Education is a million miles from Him; science is a million miles. Science and education is trying to disprove God, see, through theological seminaries and schools, and rooms of science, and so forth. They've had their shake. How about the vision the other night, of the man when he screamed to those scientists down there pouring that stuff in like that? They just turned and looked up, and went on. There'll be one more ride.\n\nL-84 Notice, oh, these three musts must be. Now, you cannot... Jesus didn't come preaching Noah's message. He didn't come preaching Moses' message. Or, Moses didn't come preaching... See, don't mislocate the Scripture. It's got to be in the time. Now, you cannot apply... When that great man, John Wesley, come out, or... The great man, Luther, when Luther came out with his message of justification. Now when that was a... Luther was a great man. He called the church out of darkness, and he set justification by faith. And when he did it, they built a organization on top of it, and it died. The Life traveled, like it is in a stalk of wheat, right out into the Wesley age, to the tassel. Out of Luther come other leaves, that died with it, which was Zwingli, and Calvin, and all the rest that come out from that great reformation.\n\nL-85 Then along came Wesley, another age had bloomed out into a tassel. Wesley, and Atterbury, and all those, and--and John and his brother, and all of them, great men of God with a message, just swept the country. They organized it; it died. Then it come out looking just exactly like she was going to put forth the grain now, and, come to find out, it was a shuck, Pentecost. But back in behind all of it, come a little bud. And you notice, usually... I think, in about three or four years after Luther was on the field, that the Lutheran church was organized. Just a short time after Wesley was on the field, it was organized. 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min\n\nL-86 Tucson, we've had a--a program of how the Wesley church, or Methodist church, come into existence. And when they come to America here, many of them had come back and said they had set up a--a charter and so forth, from England, to bring it over here, and how it was all dramatized out. I seen right then what happened. There she died.\n\nL-87 Well, out come the Pentecostal, them old shouters back in the long days ago, got the gift of speaking in tongues, and started off with speaking in tongues. Then they named it, \"the evidence of the Holy Ghost.\" Then they organized. One said he's going to do this, and the other that, and they had issues and issues. What'd it do? Each one of them leaves just unfolded, just like it did in the stalk and like it did on the tassel. They had the oneness, twoness, threeness, and the church of God, and all these others; just unfolded, unfolded, unfolded. But now, according to nature, which is a perfect example, you'll never be anything to educate It out of it.\n\nL-88 A family, of friends of mine down in Kentucky, just had a little--little baby born the other day, and the mother was up when they was cooking our dinner. And she was helping the other sister cook dinner for a bunch of us men that had been out hunting. And so the baby got to crying, and I was talking. I think the mother felt a little embarrassed, so she runs and gets the baby, and--and starts to--to feed the little fellow. I said, \"You know, that's just nature.\" See? Now, you can't... They have never found any better way for a baby to get what it wants than to cry for it. Now, you might give it a--a book of ethics, and set down here and say, \"I want to teach you theology, son. Now, don't you go to squalling around here like other kids; you're different. Now, when you want to be fed, you ring this little bell over here.\" Just don't work. No, it just don't work.\n\nL-89 So, when you watch nature, now we see where every age, and directly designed it out that we're in the last age. The shuck has pulled away. And we've had fifteen years, nearly twenty now, years, of the Message sweeping across from nation to nation, and this morning hooked-up across this nation, see, and no organization. It can't organize. There has nothing ever been like it, or will be hereafter. See? The--the thing that's the matter with the Message today, is, those who obtain It in their hearts must lay in the Presence of the Son, to get ripened. See? You can pick up the Message, and then let the Son bake all the greenness out of you, see, making matured Christians. See what I mean? God is coming soon, to receive His Church, and we must have that type of Christians for Him to receive. The--the wheat has got to get ripe. All right.\n\nL-90 These three musts must be. Must not misinterpret, or mishandle It, misinterpret It, or mis-... or dislocate It. It must be kept just exactly the way God said it was. To the world, It's a Book of mystery. The people believe It's just a mysterious Book. One time I was talking to a very famous man here in the city, that holds a great standing of Christianity, and he said, \"I tried to read the Book of Revelations one night.\" Said, \"John must have had a big bait of hot pepper and had a nightmare.\" See, a Book of mystery.\n\nL-91 But, while to the true believer, It's the revelation of God being revealed in the age we're living in. He said, \"My words are Spirit and Life.\" Jesus said that. Again, \"The Word is a Seed that a sower sowed.\" We know that that's true. It's God in Word form, and can only be interpreted by Himself. The human mind is not capable to interpret the mind of God. How can the little--little finite mind interpret the infinite Mind, when we can't even interpret one another's mind? [John 6:63], [Matthew 13:19-20]\n\nL-92 And you notice, He is the only One can interpret It, and He interprets It to whom He will. It didn't say, \"Mortals of old, as they strode across the earth in sundry times and divers manner.\" \"God, in sundry times and divers manner revealed Himself to His prophets.\" See? [Hebrews 1:1]\n\nL-93 And, notice, \"To whom He will reveal It.\" And He so designed that He can hide Himself in the Scripture, to the smartest theologian there is. Oh, my! He can just hide Himself, set right there in the Scripture, and you look all day long and never see it; look a lifetime, and never see it. He can just hide Himself, setting there.\n\nL-94 Now, please, everywhere, let that soak in. That, God, in the Word, can hide Himself so in the Word, that there isn't a theologian or a school in the world could ever find Him, and yet He's setting right there. 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min You say, \"Is that right, Brother Branham?\" How about the Pharisees and Sadducees? How about in every age? He's done it. Sure. He's done so in every age. Now we could check that. Let's think about the days of Noah; smart, intellectual age, how He hid Hisself in His promised Word. In the days of Moses, how He hid Hisself. In the days of Elijah, how He hid Hisself. In the days of Jesus, how He hid Hisself. \"He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came to His Own; His Own received Him not.\" See? [John 1:10]\n\nL-95 He hides Himself from the smartest, intellectual man there is on the earth. You say, \"Well, this is Dr. Holy Father So-and-so.\" I don't care who he is, God hides Himself from him; and will reveal it to babies such as will learn, see, babies of God, predestinated seed.\n\nL-96 Think. The Mighty God, setting in His Own Words, blinding the smart, educated people of this present age, and they don't see it. They think it's just a bunch of fanaticism. Look at Him standing there hiding, to Pentecostals, Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterian. Reveal Himself right out publicly, and showing all kinds of things, even putting it in the papers, and things like that, yet they don't see it. Oh, our God, how great, revealing Himself to whomever He will.\n\nL-97 \"Oh,\" you say, \"Brother Jones or Brother So-and-so, he's--he's a great man. He'll see It.\" Oh, no. He reveals It to whom He will. Say, \"My wife don't see It, and she's a Christian woman.\" He reveals Himself to whom He will. \"Well, my pastor is a great man.\" That's right, but He reveals Himself to whom He will. Now, check with what's been revealed, to what's happening, then you'll... you can quite understand.\n\nL-98 Now we notice then, it makes It a Book of God and not a book of man. If It was of man... Now let us look how It would express Itself. Look how It exposes sin of the men who wrote It, notice, the men who--who lived in Its day. Abraham, for instance, he's called \"the father of the faithful.\" Notice how that... Do you think Abraham would've wrote this Book on himself, of his own cowardliness? How you think he would've wrote that he lied to the king that morning, and said that was his sister, when it was his wife? Would It write of his cowardly deeds that he done? Sure, he'd never done that.\n\nL-99 How about Jacob in his deceit? A little deceiver that Jacob was. Would a--a--a man, a Hebrew writing of his Hebrew brother, that in him that all of Israel was called, would he dare to write the deceit of the very father of the whole nation? In Jacob, come forth the patriarchs; from the patriarchs, come forth the tribes. And the foundation stone of all of it, the Bible exposes him as a deceiver. Is that right? You think man would've wrote that? No, sir.\n\nL-100 How about a man writing of the greatest king they ever had here on earth, as crowned king; David, in his committing adultery? Would those Jews ever wrote of their most noble king being an adulterness? Oh, we have history, like, \"George Washington never told a lie,\" and things like that. We say, call that history. But this is a man, a Bible that calls David an \"adulterness,\" and he was. The king of Israel, an adulterness who was to be the son... Jesus to be the Son of David. The very Headstone; and His father, according to flesh, was an adulterness. Jews would never wrote a Book like that. Would man write this of his own self? Certainly not.\n\nL-101 How would that proud nation of Israel? You know how proud they were. Proud nation of Israel, went and wrote about their own idolatry, wrote about their rebellion against their God, wrote against the dirty, filthy things that they did, and wrote out in a book? They'd a-sure hid that. They'd a just showed the good things. But, this Bible, that tells what's right and what's wrong. It's, anyone knows that the Jews would've never wrote a Book like that, about their own uncleanness, and idolatry, and failure, and everything they had. They'd a-never wrote that. Oh, no. Then, Who wrote It? The Bible said, in Hebrews 1:1, \"God, in sundry times and divers manners spake to the fathers through the prophets.\" Then, it wasn't the prophets, it wasn't mortal. \"God!\" Not \"prophets in sundry time.\" But, \"God, in sundry time, divers manners spoke to the fathers through the prophets.\" I got a Scripture wrote down here. I don't know what It is; I can't refer to It. Usually, when these things I'm referring to them, I'm looking at a Scripture. I'm going to look it up just for a minute, if you'll excuse me. It's Second Timothy 3:16. I--I--I thought I would remember that, but I'm sorry. I'll just stop a minute to find out what it is.\n\nL-102 \"God, in sundry times and divers manners spake to the fathers through the prophets.\" 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min Now Second Timothy 3, 3:16. Let's see what it says in 3:16. All scripture (yeah) is given by inspiration of (Prophets? No.)... inspiration of (What?) God, and is profitable for doctrine, and reproof, and correction, and instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may stand perfect, throughly furnished in all good works. [II Timothy 3:16]\n\nL-103 All right, then, all Scripture is wrote by inspiration. Jesus, here on the earth, said that heavens and earth would pass away, but His Word wouldn't. He said all Scripture must be fulfilled. So then the Book is not a book of man's writings. It's the Books of God's writings.\n\nL-104 Now, we know God chose by predestination His Church, His place, His prophets, and all about it. By foreknowledge, He predestinated His prophet. And when the age arrived, He had His prophet arrive at the same time, and inspired him as He wrote the Bible by him. Now, God wrote the Bible only using the prophet, because that's His way of doing it. So, see, it is not the word... So, see, It is the Word of God, and not the word of man.\n\nL-105 God is a Person. God can speak. God can talk. God can write. He didn't have to do it that way, but that's the way He--He chose to do it. He didn't have to do it that way, but He chose to do it that way. Now you say, \"God wrote with His finger, His Own majestic finger, the ten commandments. So God could write, Hisself, if He wanted to.\" See? But He--He chose to write It through prophets, see. Because it was His attributes, His Word, He expressed through them, making all a part, or a part of Him. See? He could write with His finger. He also took His finger and wrote on the walls of Babylon, \"Thou are weighed in the balance and found wanting.\" He wrote with His Own finger. [Daniel 5:27]\n\nL-106 God can talk. Do you believe God can talk? He talked to Moses on the mount, in a burning bush. You believe that? Yes, sir. He talked to John, in the form of a dove, (you believe that?) that, \"This is My beloved Son in Whom I'm pleased to dwell in.\" He talked to him. He spoke to Jesus on Mount Transfiguration, before Peter, James, and John. He can talk. He's not a mute. God can talk. So He spoke to--to Jesus on Mount Transfiguration. And He spoke to Jesus before a whole multitude of people; when, the people said it thundered, but it was God speaking to Jesus. And almost all of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, is Jesus speaking. He is God. So, God can talk. [John 1:30-34]\n\nL-107 Took His Own fingers and wrote on the sand, one day. He spoke, He preached, He prophesied, with His Own lips, God did, when He was made flesh and dwelled among us, \"God manifested in flesh.\" If He can write, speak, can't He also tell others what to do? Certainly can. He can talk to them, in a human voice. He can write and show them what to do. He has done it. [John 1:1-5, 14] So, \"God, in sundry times and divers manners spake to the fathers through the prophets.\" And He said, on this Writing, that, \"Not one jot or tittle shall ever pass away until It's fulfilled,\" and then It's manifested; then It will pass, because It's manifested. It can't pass then, but just the Word Itself is made flesh. Jot means \"small word.\" Tittle means \"small mark.\" Not even one punctuation, one expression, anything, shall ever fail in the Word of God. It can't fail, because It's God, God manifested in a form of a human flesh. For, it's God Himself in letter form, prophet form, manifested in flesh. [Hebrews 1:1], [Luke 16:17], [Matthew 5:18] Now, that's the reason Jesus could say, \"The ones who spoke to you, you call them 'gods,' who spoke to you by the Word of God,\" said, \"and they were gods.\" Those prophets when they were anointed with the Spirit of God, and brought exactly the Word of God, then they were gods. It was God's Word speaking through them. And can...\n\nL-108 They only interpret as the Author would permit them to interpret. Now if you want to find that, that's Second Peter 1:20 and 21. All right. Cause, this, where God... \"There's no private interpreter.\" He does His Own interpretation. God speaks and interprets It, Himself, then reveals it to whomever He will, hides from all others. He don't have to reveal It to anybody 'less He wants to. And He don't... He, He has expressed His whole thing in the Scripture, therefore the whole thing is already made known; it's just He's just setting there watching it happen. See? No. Just seeing the Body be made and come back to Its, to the form, His Bride again. All right.\n\nL-109 Believers believe It, like Abraham that called things contrary to It as though it was not.\n\nL-110 It also, this Word, discerns the secrets of the hearts, Hebrews 4:12. \"It discerns the secrets of the heart.\" [Hebrews 4:12] 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min\n\nL-111 Prophets did not always understand what they were writing or what they were saying, or they would in no wise have said it, if they could a understood It. See? But the Bible said, \"They were moved by the Holy Ghost.\" Moved! When the Holy Ghost moves you, you move. Man... \"God, in sundry times and divers manners spake to the prophets that were moved by the Holy Ghost.\" That's why, all ages, the people who were spiritual consulted the prophets about the times and what was to happen. The prophet-writer must be in constant fellowship with the Author. See? He must live constantly in Presence of the Author, to know what the Book is going to be. See? The prophet-writer, he had the pen ready anytime, constant fellowship with the Author, which was God, to strike down whatever He said put down. See? Showed what kind of a life he must... a separated life from all of his brethren. [Hebrews 1:1]\n\nL-112 Now, that's why the prophet had his mind set constantly on what God said; not what man thought, what the age thought, what the church thought, what the kingdom thought. What God thought! He only expressed God's thoughts to Word, 'cause a word is a thought when it's expressed. You got it now? The Word is a thought expressed, so the prophet was waiting for God's thoughts. And when God revealed His thoughts to him, he expressed it in Word, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD.\" See, not \"Thus saith I, the prophet.\" \"THUS SAITH THE LORD!\" See? All right. [Jeremiah 1:5-7]\n\nL-113 That's why they defied kingdoms and church ages, which, to do so in their days, was a death penalty. You walk up in a king's face and tell him, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD, such-and-such is going to happen,\" you'd have your head chopped off. The church would put you to death right now for doing it. But these prophets were bold. Why? They were moved by the Holy Ghost, see, and, they, that's why they become bold. And they wrote the--the infallible Word of God.\n\nL-114 There was many tried to impersonate them prophets, like priests, or so forth. And what did they do? Just messed up, that's all. They couldn't do it. Cause, God had selected the man for the age, and selected the Message, and even the nature of the man and what would go over in that age, what He could put over, how He could. With the nature of that certain man, He could blind the eyes of others. The words that that man would say, the way he acted, would blind others, and open other's eyes. See? He dressed the man in the type of dress that he was; the nature, the ambition, and everything just the way he had to be, just perfectly selected for that certain people that He would call for that certain age. While, others would stand and look at him, say, \"Well, I can't. There's... I--I can't see.\" They were blinded.\n\nL-115 Jesus came the same way, dressed, immortal God dressed in human flesh. And because He was born in a manger, in a stable full of manure, not a place to lay His head; born, thinkingly, with a illegitimate name tacked to Him. See? All these things that He was, and how He come up, a carpenter's son, how He had no schooling. More or less, in the world, the wisdom of this world, He didn't have nothing to do with it. None of this world's civilization, education, or anything, He had not one thing to do with it. Why? He's God. It would clash. If He tried to go to a seminary somewhere and learn something that these world's churches was doing, what in the... Why, it wouldn't even... why, it wouldn't even... wouldn't correspond at all with His understanding, for He was God. So, education, schooling, seminaries, and things, is absolutely contrary to the will of God. The whole educational system is contrary to God. Everything teaches away from God, all the time. When I hear a man say that he is Dr., Ph.D., L.L.Q., that just makes him that much farther from God, to me. See? He just educated hisself that much farther from what he really was called to do. That's right. Notice how that now they were moved by the Holy Spirit.\n\nL-116 Now, that don't mean that educated man don't come in. Look at Paul. I guess there wasn't a smarter fellow in his day than Paul, who was Saul of Tarsus. He was educated under Gamaliel, one of the greatest teachers of the day; great, strict Hebrew, a Pharisee of denomination. And Paul was brought up under him. He knowed all the Jewish religion. But when he come to the church, he said, \"I never come to you in the education of man, and so forth. Because, if you would, then you would trust in that. But I come to you in the power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost, that your faith would be in God.\" There you are. See? That's right. [I Corinthians 2:1-5]\n\nL-117 Many tried to impersonate these people, but they got the thing all messed up just like they do today. There was one raised up before the time of Jesus, led four hundred people off. And you know how the Scriptures read about these 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min things, trying to do it before the time come. And some of them tried to impersonate Him, and they was all this, that, or the other one. And He said, \"In the last days, how they would raise up false Christs, in the last days, and false prophets, and show signs and wonders.\" We have all that. See? But that doesn't do away from the real. It only makes It shine out better, because we have a real Christ, not a false one. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-118 Now, now, we realize then that God sent His prophets. That was the way He had of bringing His Word to the people, through the lips of His prophets. And notice, you know, Moses said, if you want to read it in Exodus the 4th chapter, and the 10th and 12th verse. Moses said God spoke to him. God talked to a man, lip to ear. And he said, \"I'm slow of speech,\" Moses said. \"I, I'm not sufficient. I--I can't go.\" [Exodus 4:10]\n\nL-119 He said, \"Who made man to talk, or Who made him dumb? Who made him to see, or Who made him to hear? Didn't I, the Lord?\" Said, \"I'll be with your mouth.\" See? So... [Exodus 4:11]\n\nL-120 And Jeremiah said, if you want to read that in Jeremiah 1:6. Jeremiah said that, \"God put words in my mouth.\" See? He--He talked, lip to ear, with one prophet; and spoke through the other prophet, he had no control at all, and spoke through his lips. [Jeremiah 1:5-7]\n\nL-121 He's got ways of getting His Word out, you know. Yes, sir. So you see the Bible is God's Word, not man's word. Moses said, \"God spoke to me with a voice, and I heard Him. I wrote down what He said.\"\n\nL-122 Jeremiah said, \"I couldn't speak at all. And, the first thing you know, my lips was talking, and--and--and I was writing.\" God spoke through his lips, and it come to pass. Daniel, Isaiah, and so forth, all those prophets were just about the same.\n\nL-123 You know, in the Old Testament alone, it's more than two thousand times those prophets said THUS SAITH THE LORD. Now, if a man says THUS SAITH THE LORD, it's not the man talking. If he would, he wouldn't be a prophet, he'd be a hypocrite, see, 'cause it wouldn't (never) come to pass; one chance out of ten hundred thousand times, see, they might guess it. But if it's THUS SAITH THE LORD, the Lord God has said it. If I would say, \"Thus saith Orman Neville\"; my brother say, \"Thus saith Mr. Mann\"; I'd say, \"Thus saith Brother Vayle,\" out here, or some of these other brethren, any of you; I'm speaking what you said. If I'm truthful, I'm saying just what you said. And these men, being prophets, said, \"It's not me. I have nothing to do with it, but it's THUS SAITH THE LORD.\" So the Bible is THUS SAITH THE LORD by the prophets.\n\nL-124 Notice, they took Christ's Spirit upon themselves, and forecast the events that would come to pass. Talk about forecasts! They said what would take place down through the ages, as they set, stood, laid, walked with the Spirit of Christ upon them, insomuch that they acted like Christ. And the readers would read it and think that the prophets was speaking of themselves. You remember the eunuch when he was reading Isaiah 53:1, about how, that, \"He had wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquity, the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, with His stripes we were healed\"? The eunuch said to Philip, \"Who is the prophet speaking of, himself or some other man?\" See, the prophet spoke as if it was himself. [Isaiah 53:5]\n\nL-125 Look at David crying in the Spirit, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? My bones, they stare at me, at me,\" David. \"They pierced my feet and my hands,\" David. \"They pierced my feet and my hands. But Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither will Thou suffer Thy holy one to see corruption,\" as though David was speaking of himself being holy. It was the Son of David, that germitized, spiritual Seed coming down through there. Though David himself was a cocklebur, but on the inside of there was a Wheat grain. You get it? So, the whole Bible is not the word of man, neither was It wrote by man, brought by man, or neither can It be--be revealed by man. It's God's Word revealed by God Himself, His Own Interpreter, Christ revealing Himself in His Own Word. [Psalms 22:1]\n\nL-126 Look at Christ standing back here in David. David couldn't even think now. His mind had gone from him, as it 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min were. And He was hanging on the cross, like you see the statue here; hanging on the cross, crying, \"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me? All My bones, they stare at Me. They pierced My hands and My feet. They thrust My side.\" See? \"Why art Thou so far from Me? All the bulls of Bashan compass about. They wag their heads, saying, 'He trusted in God, that He would deliver Him; now let's see if He'll deliver Him,'\" speaking the same words. So, you see, when God was made manifest on earth here, He said the same words David did. You get it? So, you see, It's not the word of man; it's the Word of God. That was God in David; that wasn't David. He didn't know what he was saying; he was just so in the Spirit. That's the way Moses was. He was so in the Spirit, passed out of the dimension that he was living in, and stood there face to face, in that burning bush, talking to--to--to God Himself. Said, \"Take off your shoes. The ground you're standing on is holy ground.\" I imagine when Moses left there, he thought, \"What happened? What taken place? What was it?\" Said, \"Go down in Egypt. I'll go with you.\" He said, \"It's so real to me, I must go.\" He got his wife and his children... and--and his child, rather, and his stick in his hand, and took off down to Egypt, to deliver the people. See? [Exodus 3:5]\n\nL-127 God speaking, Himself, through the prophets. See, they, they're absolutely... It isn't the prophets; it was God. Cause, the prophets, of themself, they couldn't say those things. \"Who has believed our report?\" Isaiah saying, you see. \"Who has believed our report? To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? He shall grow up before us as a calf in a--in a stall. And how that, yet, He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquity, chastisement of our peace upon Him; with His stripes we were healed.\" We were healed, way over here in this age here; and Isaiah, back yonder eight hundred years before Christ. See? \"By His stripes we were,\" past tense, already, \"healed.\" Oh, my! How, the Word of God, so perfect! Trust in It, folks. It's the only thing that can save you. [Isaiah 53:1-5]\n\nL-128 All other words, I don't care how well they are placed, how, who they come from, what denomination they come from, or how smart the man is, is to be absolutely ignored, anything contrary to the Word. You want to put that Scripture down, it's Galatians 1:8. See? Paul said, \"Though we, or an Angel from Heavens, would preach any other thing than This that you've already heard, let him be cursed.\" In other words, if an Angel would come to you from Heaven, a bright shining Angel, and would stand; boy, that would be bait for this day, wouldn't it? A bright shining Angel come up there and stand, and say things was contrary to the Word; you say, \"Satan, get away from me.\" That's right. If he's a bishop, if he's a... whatever he is, don't you never believe him if he doesn't speak exactly with that Bible, Word by Word. Watch him, he'll carry you with the Bible now. He'll carry you to a certain place, and then hook it right there. When you see the Bible saying one thing, and he bypasses that, watch him right there. See, that's the way he done Eve. He come right down and said everything just exactly. \"Well, God said this. That's right, Eve. Amen. We believe that, together.\" \"Well, God said this.\" \"Amen. We believe that, together.\" \"God said this.\" \"We believe that, sure.\" \"Well, but God said we'll die.\"\n\nL-129 \"Well, now, you know He's a good God.\" He didn't say He wouldn't, you know. \"But surely...\" Oh, me! There he is. And if he was deceitful like that, and the Bible said, \"In the last days he would deceive the Elected if it was possible,\" where ought we to be today, friends? Now, these little Sunday school lessons are, should be carried pretty close, you know, to our hearts, to see... We ought to listen real close and see how deceiving that thing is. [Matthew 24:22-24]\n\nL-130 Notice, we cannot, we must not, listen to any other man's word. We don't care how smart, how educated. The Bible, in Proverbs, says, \"We must cast down reasonings.\" See? Now, here in this second realm... 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min First realm is your senses of see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. That's in your outer body. On the inner body, which is the spirit, is reasonings and thought, and so forth. We must cast all that down. Can't reason, say, \"Now wait, if God is a good God...\" And we're told so much today that He is. \"If He is a good God, then if I be sincere, though I can't see that in that Bible being right, though I be sincere, I'll be saved.\" You'll be lost. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] [Proverbs 16:25]\n\nL-131 \"If I go to church and just do the things that I believe that's right, and try to hold up for what I think is right, well, I...\" You're still lost. \"There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is the ways of death.\" See? You won't be saved; you'll be lost. See? See? It must be that inside control Man.\n\nL-132 \"Well, I've spoke in tongues, Brother Branham. Well, don't you believe in speaking in tongues, Brother Branham?\" Absolutely. \"Well, I shouted; don't you believe that?\" Yes, sir. \"I live a good Christian life. Don't you believe in that?\" Yes, sir. But still that don't mean you're saved. You're a good person; clean, moral, holy, good person. So was those priests, religious to the core, so religious till one misconstrued, they'd be stoned to death. The death penalty of fooling with the Word of God was death.\n\nL-133 That's what's the matter with our country today. The reason we got so many loose-leaf things in the earth today, the penalties are not strong enough. If a man was caught running out with another man's wife, they should both be taken out in public and castrated, right, public, and turned loose. That's right. If a man is caught doing anything wrong, down the road, speeding, he oughtn't to be given less than ten years; he's pre-... premeditated murder. See? You put penalties like that on it, you'll slow them down. But when some crooked politician can get to this one over here and pass it off, and say, \"Well, he was drinking a little, he was... didn't mean to do that.\" And would kill a man, wife, and a whole bunch of innocent children, let the Ricky get by with it, that's politics. That's the world. That's the devil.\n\nL-134 God said if a man was caught in adultery, or a woman, take them out there and stone them to death. That settled it. See? If he's even caught picking up a weight of a stick, on the sabbath day, \"Take him and stone him.\" They lived by it then. And now, see, we don't have them kind of laws today. But the Christian, the church, what I'm talking to this morning, that law of God is in your heart. See? You have no desire to do it. It's inside here. You want to keep God's law so perfect. No matter what it is, you want to be just what... If--if God needs a doormat at the door, He wants you to be that doormat, you're so happy to be that. No matter what it would be, you want to be the doormat. See? Whatever God wants you to do, that's what you want to do, 'cause it's God. Now, that's where you really find your real, genuine, true love for God.\n\nL-135 Now we find out then, that, \"An Angel would preach anything else,\" besides what's...?... already been said in the Bible, \"let him be cursed.\" Nobody can. Can't do that; It must be just exactly the way It says.\n\nL-136 And again we read, in Revelations 22:18 and 19, \"If any man will add one word to This, or take one Word from It, God will take his part out of the Book of Life.\" Right. God will take his part, though he be a minister, whatever he may be, and his word... his name is wrote on the Book of Life. God said, \"I'll just rub it right off,\" that's right, \"if he adds one thing to It, or takes one Word from It.\" That's how infallible God has made His Word. See? You can add to the church, or take from the church. Don't you add to that Word, or take from It, 'cause God will take your name right off the Book of Life. And, that's, you're finished then. See? You can't add to It, or take from It. It's just exactly what... [Revelation 22:18-19]\n\nL-137 It needs no interpreter, for the Bible said that God does His Own interpreting of the Bible. \"It's of no private interpretation,\" said Peter. All right.\n\nL-138 And all the Scripture is Divinely given, Divinely set in order, and the whole thing is the revelation of Jesus Christ. The New and Old Testament, where they foretold of Him coming, what He would do when He got here, and what He would do in this age to come. So that makes Him the same yesterday, today, and forever. See? Like in Hebrews there, when Paul wrote it. He is God, \"Jesus Christ yesterday,\" of the Old Testament. He is \"Jesus 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min Christ today,\" manifested in the flesh. \"And He's Jesus Christ forever,\" in the Spirit, \"to come.\" See? See? \"Same yesterday, today, and forever.\" And He ever lives to make His Word live what It said It would do for that age. He is alive. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-139 He was alive in the Old Testament, manifested. I just want to let you see a little something here, if you can stand it. Watch, when Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament, as we believe it. Now, you preachers out there, you can argue with it, do whatever you want to, but I'm talking for my... what I think. See?\n\nL-140 When Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament, in a theophany, in the person of Melchisedec; not a priesthood, but the Person, the Man. See? For, this Man had yet not been born, but He was in a theophany, so He had no father, no mother. He was God Himself. He was manifested in the form of a Man, called, \"King of Salem, which is King of Peace, and King of Righteousness.\" See? He was Melchisedec. \"He had neither father nor mother, beginning of days or ending of life.\" See? It was Jesus in a theophany, in the form of a Man. Could you go that? All right. [Hebrews 7:1-21], [Genesis 14:18-20]\n\nL-141 Then He was made actually human flesh, and dwelled among us, in the Person of Jesus Christ Himself, born of the virgin Mary. He come in that form so He could die, and went back into Heaven. Now in this last days, He has promised to manifest Himself in the fullness again, of His flesh, in Spirit. See? \"For as it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the Coming of the Son of man.\" Now look at the Sodom, how it set, and what taken place. And Jesus Christ being manifested in bodily form, of His Church today, see, doing the same thing, same work, same things that He did all the time, never changes, the Eternal One. See? And upon earth today, He has manifested Himself in the human bodies, our human bodies that He has called, and done exactly the same thing He done in sundry times, and in the times of His flesh upon the earth. And doing the same thing today, because, \"God in sundry times spoke to the fathers through the prophets, in this last days through His Son, Jesus Christ.\" See, the Son being revealed in the last days, God manifested in human flesh, setting just before Sodom's destruction, the end of the Gentile world. You see it? There is three manifestations. [Hebrews 1:1]\n\nL-142 Now, the next thing happens, is when it's all gathered up into that one Person, Jesus Christ, Bride and Body, at the physical return of the Lord Jesus. Making His three times... When He was brought on earth; killed, crucified, raised up. Manifesting Hisself in the form of His Body, which is His Bride, the Woman. You get it? She is part of His Body. And the woman and man is just so close together, till they're just almost... They are the same. They ought to be, anyhow. There they are, see, they just exactly manifested the same. She is a part of him, because she was taken out from him. And the Bride today is taken out from the body of Christ, which is acting and doing just exactly like He said It would do for this day, the Bride, the Queen; King and the Queen. All right. We're getting late now, so we're going to have to hurry and get through.\n\nL-143 All right, the entire Bible is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ, making Himself known to every age. He made Hisself known in the days of Luther, as a foundation; the church, the foot, the legs. Like He did King Nebuchadnezzar; you remember how he dreamed those dreams, and come from the head down? See? Now He comes from the feet up. See? In the Babylonian kingdom He showed all those Old Testament's, He come from the head down, until He come down till God Himself become flesh at the foot of the ladder. Now here in the New Testament, He brings Hisself right back up again, to the Head again, the Head of gold, to be crowned. See? Look. You get it? [Daniel 2:1-48] See, God was in the beginning, and He kept coming down, through the prophets, and on down, until God Himself became human like us, plumb down at the foot of the ladder, a baby born in a manger; hated, rejected, despised, and a bad name, and everything He was. Then He started rising, see, and from the feet He begin to build the Church, the Bride, coming back, on back; and now coming out into the Headstone, where it all joins together and makes the one great transfigured Body of Jesus Christ. 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min\n\nL-144 God is revealed in every age by His promised Word to that age. Now let's just look what some of His promises is for today, while we're closing now in these last words.\n\nL-145 Now God is revealing Himself in the evening Light time. Let's see now. We see...\n\nL-146 I just got a bunch of Scriptures wrote down here. As you can see on this page, how many Scriptures is written there. But, we just got about fifteen minutes till twelve. I want to get out. And I haven't gotten hoarse, this morning, speaking. Sometimes these air conditioners here makes me real hoarse. So if Brother Neville don't... You ain't got anything for tonight? [Brother Neville says, \"No.\"--Ed.] Well, well, I'll... If it's all right, I got something. I found a cigarette pack, the other day, laying in the woods; and I got a Message from that cigarette pack, for tonight, the Lord willing. See? So, I got these Scriptures here. And I don't want to run overtime, so you can get back.\n\nL-147 A cigarette pack, speaking. All right. I was starting out through the woods, and there laid a cigarette pack, and I just walked on away. I thought, \"Well, somebody is ahead of me.\" And Something said, \"Turn back and pick that up.\" I thought, \"Pick up a cigarette pack? Not me.\" Something said, \"Turn back and pick that cigarette pack.\" And I went down, there was an old empty pack, and I seen something. I'll tell you about it, tonight, the Lord willing. All right.\n\nL-148 Now we're going to speak about evening Lights, just for a few moments. The Bible predicts that there would come a time, right at the closing time, that the sun would come out, and there would be an evening Light. We all know that. Don't we? We, we're... We who are familiar with our Message today from the Lord Jesus, we believe that there will be a evening Light. And this evening Light... Of course, the great Light will come when Jesus Himself will be manifested here on earth, or up in the Heavens, taking away His Bride, and then the Millennium will set in.\n\nL-149 But we've got one of the most dreadful times to go through, that ever laid before human beings. And I'm just waiting for the hour, and when we can get... everybody can get a chance where you get off from work and spend a few days, and we can get set up somewhere where I can speak on those Plagues and things that's to fall in the last days; and throw about two or three weeks together, and bring that together, if the Lord let's me live to do it and will inspire me to do so, see how those things will be dropped in, and those Thunders. Then you'll find out what that man and them people have been dreaming about, and all these things there, it'll come to pass; see, you'll notice what them revealed, that great thunder a coming forth out of the--out of the skies. Now, of course, the whole bunch of you, you know that I know what that--what that means, you see. And, but let's just wait till the time comes, you see, for it to be, see, now, and it'll be more in season.\n\nL-150 Now, so we are going to read some of these--these Scriptures in here. Now, in the evening Lights come, now, we notice that it'll have to be the same Light that was in the morning. Cause, there's not one sun in the morning and another sun in the afternoon. It's the same sun. Same sun that's in the afternoon is in the morning; the same in the morning as in the afternoon. Now, It said, \"The day itself,\" the day between that time, \"will be kind of like, oh, like a dismal, dark day. It could not be called day or night, in between that.\" [Zechariah 14:6-7]\n\nL-151 See, that's the forming of the Body, from the feet, coming up. When He was here on earth, He was the Son, the Lightness, then He was killed. The Church took His place, then martyrdom and went through the Dark Ages, and begin to build on the foundation coming out. Then where does the sight come from? At the top of the head. See that vision; Nebuchadnezzar? See Him going down, from the beginning of the Gentile age before the Blood was shed for them and made an atonement. They were proselytes brought in. But notice it went right down, right down, right down to the bottom, in symbol, see, brought it down. Then it started right back, coming back, the Church come back from the feet, coming up. Now it's in the head 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min time--head time. Now notice the Light.\n\nL-152 You can't see with your hands, yet it's part of the body. You can't see with the ears, yet it can hear. You can't see with the nose, yet it smells. You can't--you can't see with the lips, though it speaks; see, that was the Pentecostal age. But now it's in the eye time, the seeing. See? Now, there isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye. Is that right? The next is the intelligence, which is Christ Itself, Who controls the whole Body. No moving, motion beyond that. See? Everything else has moved. See? Move your feet, move your muscles in your legs, move everything. Move your... Your ears can move, your nose, your lips, and so forth. But after your eyes, there is nothing moves. That's why they claim that man get baldheaded quick, is because, see, there's no exercise to develop the muscles in--in the hair, the scalp. See? And it's not got a cushion so that they get blood up in there. The blood won't pump through, see, won't go up and furnish blood. Course, the--the hair root lives by blood. And now we find out that that part, you see, there is nothing beyond the eye.\n\nL-153 Now let's find out. \"It shall be Light\" (about the middle day?) \"at the evening time!\" What is Light sent for? So you can see where you're... how to get around. Is that right? See where you're at. \"It shall be Light about the evening time.\" [Zechariah 14:7]\n\nL-154 Now, we take that now and compare it over with Malachi 4. He promised that there would be Light come again in the evening time, see, \"For, behold, I will send to you Elijah the prophet, and he will restore the--the children back to the fathers, and the fathers to the children,\" (is that right?) \"lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.\" [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-155 Now let's take John or... Saint Luke 17:30, and watch what Jesus prophesied there, saying that, \"As it was in the days of Sodom, it'll be the same...\" [Luke 17:30] Now remember, notice, this is at the time that the Son of man would be revealed; the revealing of the Son of man. Now, the Son of man was actually revealed potentially, just for a few moments there, just before Sodom was burned. Now, that Man was Elohim. That was God; and Jesus is God. And God was revealed potentially right there for a few moments, to talk to Abraham, in the investigation judgment. Just for a little bit, the Son of man was revealed; the Son of man, Elohim. Do you see it, church? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] The Son of man, Elohim, was revealed just for a few minutes. For, the very next morning she was burned, (when?) before the sun could come up again. So there can't be no organization left, neither can there be any further advancement than what's going right now, for she'll burn before the day breaks again. The revival is over, across the nation. There ain't going to be no more revivals, big sweeping revivals; this nation never receive it. You might have a intellectual gathering. But, I mean, a Spiritual revival, we've seen all of it. I hope you're catching it. I'm saying it in such a way that--that I hope you get it. See? It's over. A fine minister said, a while ago, said, \"Brother Branham, if I could just have the joy of the Lord in my heart!\" I said, \"Son, the revival is over.\" See?\n\nL-156 Now the stabilizers has been put on the ship. Great fearful waves are out here before us; but we know, just beyond that wave yonder, we're nearing the shore. See? We're nearing the shore. Just stay stabled. Just stay in the Word. Stay with God. No matter how you feel, what anything else; stay right with the Word. Let--let--let it stay stable, when you see all these great big old clouds around us, and storms a coming, and atomic bombs, and everything else they're talking about. But our stabilizer is right straight in the Word. God said it would be here; we'll crest every one of them. Yeah, we'll go right over the top of them. Yes, indeed! They, they can't sink us. They can't drown us. You put us in the grave; we'll come out again. That's just all there is to it. There ain't no way in the world to keep it down there. We'll crest every one of them, 'cause our great Chief Captain is calling at the other side. We're anchored in Jesus, the storms of life I'll brave; I've anchored in Jesus, I fear no wind or wave;\n\nL-157 Whatever it might be, let it come. What may, what will, doesn't make any difference. We're anchored right there in Jesus. If I live, I'll live to the glory of God. If I die, I die to the glory of God. I--I--I just want to just... It's to the glory of God, is what I want to do. When that's all over, I don't want to stay any longer. I want to go to where... to my reward 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min that He bought for me; not what I earned, but what He bought for me, what He give to me by His grace.\n\nL-158 So we see the evening Light's here. And what does it do to have Light, if you don't have any eyes to see how to get around in It? What is the evening Light? The Light comes on, to reveal something. Is that right? If there's something here, you feel and you can't understand what it is, in the darkness, then turn a light on. It's to reveal! What's Malachi 4 to do? See? Do the same thing. What was the opening of the Seven Seals to do, where all these denominations staggering around in this...?... Is to reveal, bring out. If you haven't got any eyes, then what's the use to reveal? There has to be eyes, first, to see. Is that right? To reveal Malachi 4, reveal Saint Luke 17:30, Saint John 14:12, also John 15:24, 16:13. And to also reveal Revelations 10:1 to 7, the opening of the Seven Seals, and the seventh angel's Message; to open up, to reveal, when the evening Light's come. Now if a man... [Malachi 4:5-6], [Revelation 10:1-7], [Luke 17:30], [John 14:12], [John 15:24], [John 16:13]\n\nL-159 In the Laodicean Age, the people were (what?) \"naked.\" Are they? \"Blind.\"What good does Light do to a blind man? If the blind leads the blind, don't they all fall in the ditch? \"Naked, blind, and don't know it.\" Even their mental faculties are gone, their spiritual faculties of mental, spiritual understanding. See? [Revelation 3:14-21] \"Heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God; trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, and despisers of those that are good; having a form of godliness, but denying the Power thereof.\" The power of revelation; they don't even believe in it. See? They don't believe in such things as prophets. And so they don't believe in it. They believe that--that Malachi 4 is to be a certain church or a certain organization. [II Timothy 3:1-8], [Malachi 4:5-6] When he come the first time, he was a man. When he come the second time, with a double portion, he was a man. When he come in the form of John the Baptist, he was a man. See? [Malachi 3:1-3], [Matthew 17:10-13] In the last days, when the evening Lights begin to shine, eyes will become open and you'll see where you're going. Then the Body is already formed, standing upon its feet, taking motion, moving by the Holy Spirit. What? The same One that moved upon the prophets that wrote the Bible, the same Holy Ghost moving in a Body filled with the Holy Ghost, moved in the Holy Ghost, out of every organization, every kindred, tongue, and people.\n\nL-160 A little lady here, she don't belong in this organization, or this organization... belong in this congregation. She comes from somewhere else, and she come in this morning, got a picture there. She was... give it to my son, who was very much astonished. I don't know whether she ever heard about This or not. I don't know. She had a picture of this Angel of the Lord that was on the Seven Church Ages, Seven Seals opened, out there, when it did. Said, looked back through there, and she seen that standing in the sky, in a dream. And she looked back through there and seen that, seen somebody in white, marching forward; and behind it, said it looked... Said, \"Brother Branham, it was you.\" And said, \"Marched in there,\" said, \"behind you, was people of different colors, packing banners; Georgia, Alabama, all different kind of places, marching forward,\" coming up into the headship to where Christ was being revealed into the vision. Oh, hallelujah!\n\nL-161 We're in the last days, and the last hours of the days. Do you see Him now in His Word, and all of His Word made manifest right here before us? Oh, Church of the living God, get to your feet, believe Him with all that's in you. Hold to that little Wheel in the middle of the wheel, let It stabilize every move and every motion that you make. Every thought that you have, may it be controlled by this Tower on the inside of you. Because, God is setting right in His Word of this hour, in the evening Light, showing forth the Light.\n\nL-162 The blindness of a bat! You could turn on a light, and the bat--bat would be so blind he couldn't fly. A hoot owl, all those night prowlers, and things like that, roaches and things, can't see in the daytime. They don't know what it's all about. They can't see. And the evening Lights has come on. Every parable, everywhere we go, to nature, to the Bible, to the--the statues that Melc-... that Daniel saw, and--and the king of that day, all of them saw; and all these things, everybody, every form, every move, every place in the Body, positionally shows us the very hour that we're living in. Not another move can come above it. There was a move of the hand; charity, Wesley. There was a move, of foundation; Luther. Charity, there never was a greater; it was called the Wesley move. They sent missionaries to all the world. One of the greatest moves that was 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min made, in the age before that. Then come the Pentecostal age; then come in the different fingers and things, the Pentecostal age, of tongues, and nose, and so forth. Now it's in the eyes. What good will you need eyes, or need light, if that eyes wasn't there to see? There has to be eyes, first, to see. And then when that come, He opened the Seven Seals and revealed the evening Light, taking all the mysteries that's been hid down through these church ages, and now revealed them as He promised to do in Revelations 10:1 to 7. Here we are today setting in the midst of the Word, and the Word being revealed to us by Jesus Christ. Then, This is God's Word. [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-163 And be His subjects, we must walk close to the Author, to understand It, for It to reveal. \"O Lord, what will Thou have to me, to do? If I must go to the fields and preach the Gospel, or must I stay at home? No matter what it is, if I must be a good housewife, if I must be a good mother, if I must do this, that, or the other? Whatever it is, if I must be a farmer, if I... Whatever it is, Lord, what would You have me do?\" [Acts 9:6]\n\nL-164 Wasn't that what Saul cried out down there, \"Lord, what would You have me do?\" He was down on the ch-... on his road down to--to put all the church into prison. But then he cried out, \"What would You have me do?\" When the Light turned on, as a big Pillar of Fire hanging above him. \"What would You have me do?\"\n\nL-165 Think, that's a good word to close on, and say, \"Lord, what would You have me do? When I see this Scripture so perfectly revealed right now; Lord, what would You have me do?\" Let us bow our heads.\n\nL-166 I ask everyone in here to search out your hearts now and ask that question, \"Lord, what would You have me do?\" And you people, if you're still on the telephone wires out across the nation, you bow your head and ask, \"Lord, what would You have me do? Seeing that we're here in the last days and the last hours, just so perfectly before us, so plainly revealed, what would You have me do?\"\n\nL-167 Dear God, while they're asking You that question; I ask, myself, to You, what would You have me do, Lord, as I realize that each day must be counted for. And I pray that You'll help me, Lord, to live so that each day, it'll be counted to Your honor and glory. I pray that You'll help everyone all across the nation, and those here that's present in the tabernacle as we search out our hearts and say, \"Lord, what would You have me do? What could I do, Lord, to further Your Kingdom and Your Cause?\" Grant it, the God. Search us, our hearts, and try us. If there be any iniquity in us, Lord, any selfishness, any bad motives or objectives, O God, cleanse us with the Blood of Thy Son, Jesus Christ, who we humbly accept His propitiation of His death and His resurrection. And being justified by believing that He did this, we gladly accept the plan of salvation that You give us, to us. Father, we thank You for the Message of the day, what we believe and what we hold onto, to know and believe that it's Your Word and Your Message. Not to be different from the other people, but to try to be more like Jesus Christ Who is our example.\n\nL-168 Dear God, laying here is handkerchiefs, and there is sick people everywhere. And I myself, Lord, am tired and wore out, this morning. I pray that You'll help us, dear God. We look to You for strength. You are our Strength. You've helped so many, dear God.\n\nL-169 The other day, thinking down there in the woods, walking around with Brother Banks Woods, when the doctors... His heart was so bad he couldn't hardly walk around. Then to think how I... little I knowed up there, walking in those mountains after that vision, \"I must get that lion. I must see that lion killed.\" And then coming down there, and standing there in Tucson, at Furr's Cafeteria, and see his clothes all bagging down, his eyes drooped. Said, \"God, if You can show a vision, where a lion is, surely You can show about Brother Woods.\" And then it come, \"Lay your hands upon him.\" And here he is today, back, our Brother Banks again, strong, running up-and-down those mountains. How we thank Thee, dear God. You're the same God to all of us as You would be to Brother Woods. I know You love him, because 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min he's Your servant, honest and sincere.\n\nL-170 And I pray, dear God, that You will deal with each one of us, and forgive our sins, and heal our sicknesses of our bodies. Make us more like You, day by day, Lord, until we come in that full statue of Jesus Christ. Grant it, Lord. I trust that You've searched every heart, now, and we know what to do. We ask for You to bless us now, in Jesus' Name.\n\nL-171 And while we have our heads bowed, is there any here present, or out in the--in the telephone land across the nation, that would just like to, while you're praying, and your head bowed, just raise up your hand to God now. That's all you can do; it's crowded in here this morning. Just raise up your hand to God, say, \"God, make me more like Jesus. I--I want to be more like Jesus.\" God bless you. Out into the land across the nation, hands just everywhere, just a solid mass. Also, mine lifted up. \"I want to be more like Him. Search me, Lord, and find if there be any evil in me; take it out. I--I want...\" What? We're just here so long, yet we're going to leave whether you're... whether, no matter what you are, how rich, how poor, how young, how old.\n\nL-172 Standing yesterday to a--a little, poor bunch of people way up in a mountain, down at the... on the creek. There was a little family there, a man I been talking to about God, so long. Come down, his little wife, seven or eight children; him, a little bitty, spindly thing, out there trying to work, couple dollars a day. And a man let him live in a little shanty. And there his wife up there, nearly ready to have another child, and she had a big broad axe up there, chopping wood, to pull it down; baby on one hip, pulling the wood with another; come down to cut that wood, to can some blackberries, keep from going hungry through the winter. My, how we felt sorry for her! Brother Woods and I went and got the truck, and went over there and cut her wood, and brought it in. She, grateful little woman, just standing there. I felt sorry for her. And we kept praying for them.\n\nL-173 And her little baby took epilepsy. We went and prayed for the little baby, and God healed it. And the other day, her husband had a hernia, and went in... I been talking to him. He smoked, both of them. She used tobacco, and he did, too, typical of mountain people. And then I kept talking to them about it. And yesterday morning when I went in, about daylight, here he come walking out, holding his hands together, and said, \"Brother Billy, I'm a changed man.\" He said, \"I've smoked my last cigarette, and I'm over on the Lord's side.\" She said, \"I just smoked my last one, too.\" Oh, plant the seed! \"I the Lord have watered. I'll water it day and night, lest some shall pluck it from My hands.\"\n\nL-174 O God, be merciful now, I pray, and give us the desire of our heart, 'cause in our hearts we want to serve You. Now, Father, they're all in Your hands, everywhere. They're Your children. Deal with them according to mercy, Lord; not in judgment, but in mercy. We ask in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-175 You love Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen. \"--Ed.] All your heart! Now, you that have the handkerchiefs, can get them. And now, our services, I think they start a little early, seven o'clock, or something like that. Brother Neville will announce it, just in a minute, about when to start. Is there a baptism, I guess, this morning? [Brother Neville says, \"The water is ready.\"--Ed.] The water is ready, if somebody is here and has not yet been baptized in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, why, it certainly is... Water is ready for the baptismal service.\n\nL-176 We appreciate all the minister brothers. I see Brother... How was your meeting, went all right, Brother Parnell? And Brother Martin, and, oh, so many of them here, Brother Lee Vayle. Oh, there's just ministers all over the place. We certainly appreciate you being here, fellowshipping with us around the Word.\n\nL-177 Maybe you might not agree with me just exactly on This; don't ask you to, you see. Only thing, you just consider It. What you tell me, I consider it. If ministers would pick up the tape, and they say, \"Well, I disagree with.\" That's all right, my brother. You maybe shepherd some sheep; you--you feed them whatever you wish to. I'm trying my best to stay right with the Word, for these that's been put in my hands for God, 'cause sheep want sheep food, of course. \"My sheep hear My Voice.\" And that's what we live by, every Word that proceedeth... Not all... Not 65-0822M, Christ Is Revealed In His Own Word, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 127 min just a Word now and then; but every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, that's what the saints should live by. Let us stand now to our feet. While we bow our heads... And Brother Neville, you got something you want to say to them? [Brother Neville says, \"No.\"--Ed.] Brother Mann? All right. Everybody feeling good? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"Ed.] All right. Now let us bow our heads. I'm going to ask Brother Lee Vayle if he'll come up here, or he can. If you can get over there, Brother Vayle, if you can. Brother Vayle is our brother here, a writer of the books. And he's getting the book ready now, The Seven Church Ages, and working with The Seven Seals. And we'll soon hope to have them out pretty soon. All right. Brother Lee Vayle, God bless you.

Dear God, we're grateful to You tonight for this grand opportunity, to come again in the Name of the Lord Jesus, to meet our enemy, Your enemy, out here on the field of battle; with the Word, to drive him away from the midst of Your people; that they might see, tonight, Lord, the Gospel Light. I pray that You'll anoint our eyes with the eyesalve, that it might be opened to the Truth; that we might leave here, saying within our hearts, \"Did not our hearts burn within us as He spoke to us along the road?\" Heal the sick and the afflicted. Encourage the discouraged. Lift up the feeble hands that once hung down. May we look to the Coming of the Lord Jesus, which we believe is at hand. We ask this in Jesus' Name. Amen. Be seated. [Luke 24:32]\n\nL-2 I will try to be briefly tonight, because I know many has come from different sections of the country, to... for the service; or stayed over, some of you, and have to go back, for maybe a ways to get back. And I thank you. This morning I wanted to hear Brother Neville, myself. And I heard him many times, and never heard him any time but what I appreciated him. But this morning, that timely message, I know I had the leading of the Lord to listen to that this morning. Very fine! And I see why you people like to come and listen to him, also. And he'll always do you good, I'm sure, to listen to him.\n\nL-3 I was trying to catch up on some of my interviews today; this morning and this afternoon. I still have many, many, many to go. And I...\n\nL-4 As, I believe, it was Jethro told Moses one time, said, \"It's just too much for you.\" So, we've got plenty of brothers here on your problems. And every one of them has been legitimate, and they are fine things that has to be taken care of. And I would recommend our pastor, or Brother Mann, and other ministers of our Faith here. You can go to them. They would tell you just exactly the thing to do; some people, their children; intermarrying, or things that's wrong. And these man can help you just the same as--as anyone else, 'cause they're servants of Christ. And go to them, and I'm sure they will--they will give you the help that you need. I can't get to all of them. There's just so many, everywhere you go. They just keep accumulating higher and higher, you see. And you want to get to every one of them, but you can't do it. But I'm constantly praying that God, in somehow, will work it out all right for you.\n\nL-5 Now, tonight, we want to go to the Scripture, and read a portion of the Scripture out of Genesis, the 3rd chapter; and just refer back a little bit to some things that we've been talking about, in times past, and see if the Lord Jesus will give us a little bit more to what we will know when we go out. I pray--pray that He will. Now the serpent was most subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest you die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God does know that in the day that you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. [Genesis 3:1-7]\n\nL-6 May the Lord add the... His blessings to the reading of His Word. Now I would like to take a text tonight, out of that, and call: Satan's Eden. Very crude little thing to say, of, Satan's Eden. It kind of matches, in the other Sunday 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min night, I believe, when I was speaking to you here about A Thinking Man's Filter, and a holy man's taste.\n\nL-7 And sometimes these little crude expressions brings us to something; it gets us to study, and puts you to reading the Word. And that's what I want all my congregation to do. \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" So, read the Word; study It. And study It with the eyes of God, to give your intellectuals understanding of how that we should live in this present day. [Matthew 4:4], [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-8 Now to come down, tonight, just to speak to you, to say, \"Well, I could do this or that,...\"\n\nL-9 I like to speak with the people, as much as I'd like to even go home with each one of you tonight. I... God knows that's truth. I'd like to go home with each one of you, and--and eat--eat breakfast with you in the morning, and--and--and go out and squirrel hunt with you tomorrow afternoon, see. I--I'd like to do that, but I--I can't do that. And I would like to go home and just sit down and talk with you; sit on the porch after the service, and speak with you a while, talk to you about your welfare and about God. I would love to do that. Men and women in here; God knows I'd like to do that, but I can't do it. See, there's just such--such a pull and a strain.\n\nL-10 And--and in this nervous age that we're living in... And I'm a nervous person, myself. Today I got my mind made up to something, \"I've just got to do it,\" and tomorrow it's a million miles away from me; something has done cut in and done this and that. And you have a time, trying to keep your wits together.\n\nL-11 But my main achievement is to preach the Gospel through the Church, and do all that I can to bring honor to Jesus Christ in this day, while I'm here on earth, and what time I have left on earth. I come to--to try to say something to you that would help you; something. I studied after I went home this morning. \"What could I say tonight, Lord, that would help those people?\"\n\nL-12 Listening to that mighty message this morning on... Brother Neville brought us, about... I thought it was so wonderful, how he said there, \"A doctor will diagnose the case; but the man that comes with a pan full of needles, he gives the injection.\" So I thought that was really a--a real cute little expression. I thought about that, \"the serum, after the case is diagnosed.\" So that's a very good thing.\n\nL-13 I wanted to speak to you something, to bring something to enlighten to you the promise of God for this age. See? Something, not something that somebody else was in some other day, but something... and when... Them things are all right; we all refer to those things. But I thought I would try to bring something to your mind, with these Scriptures I got written here, that would enlighten you, to know, make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now; to learn the tactics of the enemy, so that you can block everything before it gets to you, see. That's the main thing, is to learn to keep the--the punches off of you, as much as you can.\n\nL-14 Now, let us look now to this great... for a few minutes, this great, sinful day that we're now living in. I don't believe there ever was a day that I've ever read in history... There's been greater days of persecution, when the children of God was put to death on every hand. But to see the deceitfulness of the enemy, we've never had a day like this we're now living. It's the most cunning, deceitful day. And when I see that, it brings this, that, the Christian has to be more on his toe today than he ever was in any age.\n\nL-15 Now, back in the days of the persecution, of Rome, to the Church; a Christian make a mistake, he went into the arena and was fed to the lions, or something like that, when they found him of being a Christian for his testimony. But his soul was saved, because he was a purely, unadulterated believer in God, and gladly sealed his testimony with his blood. As the veins let loose, or holes in his body, and the blood bled out, he would scream up, with real loyal faith, and say, \"Receive my spirit, Lord Jesus!\" [Acts 7:59]\n\nL-16 But, now, the cunningness of the devil now, makes the people believe that they are a Christian when they're not. There is the thing. You don't have to seal... It's--it's a more cunning day than it would be, than when you had to seal your--your life away with your testimony. The devil has set every cunning trap that he can, to... He's a deceiver. And Jesus told us, in Matthew 24, how this day would be that we're living in, the most deceitful day that ever lived, \"so close that it would deceive the very Elected of God if it were possible for him to deceive.\" [Matthew 24:4, 5, 11, 24], [Mark 13:5-6] 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min\n\nL-17 Now let us compare some Scriptures, or prophecies spoken of in the Bible, for today, and compare it with the day that we're now living in.\n\nL-18 In Second Timothy 3, we learn this, that the prophet said, that, \"It would come to pass in this days, that man would be heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.\" Compare that now, just for a moment. We won't... We'll just brief it, because we haven't that much time to go through it all like we should duly take it; but just to highlight it, so that you can see when you get home and study it. \"Heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God; trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, and despisers of those that are good.\" \"Now the Spirit spoke expressingly that these things would be in the latter days.\" That's these days, the prophecy speaking to it. [II Timothy 3:3-4], [I Timothy 4:1]\n\nL-19 Now we read, also, in Revelations... 14, Revelations 3:14, rather, the Laodicean Church Age, that how the church would be in this last age. And it would be, It says, \"It would sit as a widow and have need of nothing. It--it was rich, and increased in goods, and know it not that they were poor, miserable, wretched, blind, and naked, and didn't know it.\" Now, remember, He is speaking to the church of this age, \"wretched, blind, naked, and don't know it.\" That last phrase, that last Word, is what makes it so striking. They think that they are well filled with the Spirit, they're all ready. The Laodicean Church Age is the Pentecostal Church Age, 'cause it's the last church age. Luther had his message; Wesley had his message; and Pentecost had their message. [Revelation 3:14]\n\nL-20 Also, It said, that, \"Because you are lukewarm, neither hot or cold,\" the emotions of the outside, the mental conception of the Gospel; \"because,\" He said, \"you're that way, I'll spew you out of My mouth.\" In other words, it made Him sick to see the church in that condition. [Revelation 3:14-16]\n\nL-21 And, remember, they spewed Him out; and He was on the outside of the church, trying to get back on the inside, in that awful Laodicean Church Age.\n\nL-22 The god of this world today, the worshiped person of this world today, is Satan. And the people are ignorant of worshiping Satan, but it's Satan impersonating himself as the church, see, as the church. They worship Satan, thinking that they are worshiping God through the church, but it's the way Satan has done it. \"Oh,\" you say, \"but wait a minute; we preach the Word.\" [II Thessalonians 2:2-4]\n\nL-23 Look back here at my text, tonight. Satan was the one that preached the Word to Eve, first, \"God hath said,\" see.\n\nL-24 It's that misconstruing that part of the Scripture that applies to the day. He'll let you know all Jesus did was perfectly well. He'll let you know all that Moses did was perfectly well. But when you take the promises that They gave for this day, then That was applied to another age. That's just all he has to do, see, is to get the people to believe It that way, and that--that's all. For, \"You cannot take one Word away from It, or add one word to It.\" But that's what he does. [Revelation 22:19]\n\nL-25 People, ignorantly worshiping Satan, thinking they are worshiping God; as we are warned by prophecy, in Second Thessalonians. That, let's just read that, Second Thessalonians, the 2nd chapter. Let's just get it a moment, if I can, right away. I'd like to read that. Just, I believe, Second Thessalonians. I got the Scripture here. In Second... Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of the Lord Jesus... and by the gathering together unto him, [II Thessalonians 2:1-4]\n\nL-26 Now, see, \"the coming of the Lord, and the gathering to Him,\"as God will gather His people to Him in the last days. \"The gathering of the people to the Lord,\" not to the church, \"to the Lord; gathering together unto Him.\" That ye be not soon shaken in your mind, or... troubled--troubled, neither by spirit, nor... word, nor by letter as from us, as... the day of the Lord is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin (\"man of sin,\" watch what he is now), the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, (that was Judas, see); Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. [II Thessalonians 2:3] 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min\n\nL-27 That deceitfulness of the church of today! See, \"the son of perdition,\" the devil. \"The son of perdition,\" the devil. Then, people worshiping Satan in this day, thinking they're worshiping God. But they're worshiping him through a creed, a man-made denominations and creeds that's brought the people right down to the greatest deception that the world has ever knowed of. No matter how much the Word of God promised for this day, is preached and vindicated, they still won't believe It. They won't believe It. [II Thessalonians 2:3]\n\nL-28 Then why? We wonder why. Why doesn't it; why won't they believe It? When God said He would do a certain thing, and He does it, and still they turn their back from it and turn away from it. Just as Eve knew that what God said, God would do; but she turned her back on it, to listen to what he had to say.\n\nL-29 Just remember, in other ages, it's always been the same thing. In every age, it's always been that Satan tries to pervert that Word to them, making them see some other age.\n\nL-30 Look, when Jesus come, see, Satan was in that bunch of Jewish teachers, and rabbis and priests, trying to tell them to keep the law of Moses, when the very Word said that in that day the Son of man would be revealed, see, that He would reveal Himself. So they was trying, as long as they kept them religious, and on the law of Moses. See what he did? He was trying to tell them, \"That part of the Word is just exactly right, but this Man isn't that Person.\" See how deceiving he is? That's that real day of deception. [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-31 It's been, and now is, Satan establishing his kingdom in the earth. That's exactly why he's doing it, for he wants to establish his own kingdom.\n\nL-32 As a businessman, that's not a Christian, he'll work every scheme he can to make you see something the wrong way. If he's got a--a purpose and a personal gain in making you doing that, making you seeing it that way, he'll show you everything he can, and keep you off from the truth of it, because he's got a feeling only for himself. No matter how much he lies and cheats, and whatever more, he's got personal gain.\n\nL-33 And that's why Satan has done this. And he has worked through the ministry to do it, as God promised he would do. Now, he began by a religious deceit in Eden, and has continued ever since.\n\nL-34 Not by setting up a bunch of communists. Communists has nothing to do with this. It's the church, that's where you have to watch, see. It's not the--it's not the communists that would deceive the very Elected. It's the church that'll deceive the very Elected, see. It isn't communists; we know they deny God, and they're antichrist, sure they are, in principle, but they are not the antichrist. The antichrist is religious, very religious, and can quote the Scripture, and make It look so plain.\n\nL-35 As Satan did back there in the beginning, he quoted everything right down, \"God has said, 'Thou shalt not eat every tree of the garden.'\" See, quote It right out. [Genesis 3:1]\n\nL-36 She said, \"Yes, we may eat of all the trees of the garden, but there is a tree in the midst of the garden that God said not to eat, for, not even touch it; 'cause, the day we did, that day we would die.\"\n\nL-37 He said, \"Oh, surely you'll not die. But let me give you the reason why God said this, is because...\" See, he now what? He quoted this Truth, you see. He said, \"It'll open your eyes, and it'll make you know good and wrong. You'll be like God then, if you can do it.\" [Genesis 3:2-4]\n\nL-38 That's just what he wants to do, and that's just the same thing he is trying to do today. There's been a religious deceit since the very beginning at Eden, and has been ever since. In Adam's time, it was a deceit. In Noah's time, it was a deceit. In Jesus' time, was the same. And now is the same, the same way, a religious deceitfulness! [Genesis 3:4-5]\n\nL-39 Now, we will notice the earth, when God had it under control. Now, when God had it control... had it under His control. Then when Satan took over, by rejecting the Word of God. God one time had the earth under His control. He set it in its orbit. He put it, make it work. He done everything, had it in His control. Now we'll compare that with after Satan took it in his control.\n\nL-40 Now, it took God six thousand years. It didn't take Him that long, but He took that long. Six thousand years, because we're taught that \"one day in Heaven is a thousand years on earth,\" and it was six thousand years, or six days 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min that God built the earth. Now, it took God six thousand years to establish it, plant it with good seeds and to bring forth everything after its kind. Everything must come forth of its kind. All of His seeds were good, and so it must bring forth after its kind. God took six thousand years. [II Peter 3:8]\n\nL-41 Finally, when He got it all made, and finally we... finally arrived with its headquarters, of the earth, in a beautiful spot laying east of Eden, called the garden of Eden. God made the world's headquarters in the garden of Eden, in Egypt, right at the east end of the garden was the headquarters.\n\nL-42 And over the whole situation, He put His son and His son's wife, over all of it. That's right. That's what God did. He put them in full control. They could speak to the winds, and it would cease to blow. They would speak to the tree, and it would move from here to there.\n\nL-43 The lion and the wolf fed together, and the lamb laid down with them. There was no evil. It was perfect peace, perfect harmony, everything in perfection, and when God had it under His control. And notice, He had His... He had His world, He had all in operation. He had everything coming. Everything eating vegetations; nothing to die, nothing to be ruined, nothing to be spoiled. Nothing... It was just perfect.\n\nL-44 And over it all, He placed His beloved children, His son and His daughter, a husband and wife, to control it.\n\nL-45 God was so satisfied! \"And He rested from all His works, at the seventh day,\" and hallowed this seventh-day sabbath for Him. [Genesis 2:2]\n\nL-46 Because, God looked it all over, after He had been six thousand years in molding it and fixing it out, making it come into existence; and put the mountains up, and make the volcanics push the mountains up, and the things that taken place in the eruptions; dried it off, and fixed it the way He had it. And it was a beautiful place.\n\nL-47 There was nothing like it, the great paradises of God! And the great dinosaurs, and whatever more, crawling through it, and of the great animals; no harm in them. They were just as gentle as a little kitten. They had nothing at all; no--no sickness, no sorrow; not one disease germ on the earth. Oh, what a place!\n\nL-48 The great birds swinging from tree to tree, and Adam could call them by name, and they would fly up on his shoulders and--and coo to him. And, oh, what a wonderful place God had!\n\nL-49 And then made one of His attributes from His Own Body. God has attributes in His Body. Like, you are an attribute of your father. And, you notice, you was in your grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's. But, in that, say, we'll take it down to like you and your father. Now, you did not know anything when you were in your father. The germ of life comes from the male. The male has the blood cell; the woman has the--the egg; now, therefore, the blood cell has the life in it. And, then, when you were in your father, you actually knowed nothing about it. But, yet, science and God's Word proves that you were in your father, but you knowed nothing about it.\n\nL-50 But then the father longed to know you. And with the union of connection with mother, then you were made known to father. Now, you are your father's attribute. You look like him, and you've got parts of your body that looks like your father.\n\nL-51 Now, that's the way God was in the beginning. Every son of God and every daughter of God was in God at the beginning. You don't remember it now, but you were there. He knowed it. And He wanted you to become so He could contact you, speak with you and love you, and shake your hands.\n\nL-52 Don't you want your own boy... Isn't it a great day when your boy can come home and sit down at the table? When he comes back from the battlefield, or something another, scarred up; how you'll fix the dinner; you kill the fatted calf, or whatever more, and prepare for him! It's your own flesh and blood, and he was in you. You didn't know him then, but you knew he was there.\n\nL-53 And so God knew that we would be here, but then He put us in flesh so we would be contacted. In order He could contact, He become one of us when He become Jesus Christ, the Son of God Himself, the fullness of the manifestation of God. Therefore that was God's purpose, to display His attributes in fellowship.\n\nL-54 When I was in my father, I knew nothing about it. But when I become his son and was born of him, I was a 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min attribute, a part of my father. And you're a part of your father.\n\nL-55 And as children of God, we are a part of God's attribute that was in Him, made flesh like He was made flesh, so we can have fellowship one with the other, as a family of God upon the earth. And that was God's purpose at the beginning. Yes, sir. That's what God wanted at the beginning.\n\nL-56 He had everything under control. And He turned man over into the garden of Eden, on free moral agency; say, \"Son, it's yours.\"\n\nL-57 What a beautiful place! God was so satisfied, till He just went back and rested from all of His works. Every tree never brought forth thorns and thistles. No berries ever come off of a thorn tree. Everything was perfect. All seeds were perfect. Everything was in perfect condition.\n\nL-58 Then when He went to take a little rest, His enemy slipped in with deceit, and took it over, by misinterpreting His program to His children. When, He put trust in His Own child; as you put trust in your daughter when she goes out at night with a man; when you put trust in your son when he has to go with a drinking boy or a smoking boy. See, He put trust in His son, that he would not do anything wrong, and would keep every Word that He said. But the enemy slipped in; like that greasy slicker that would take out your daughter and misbehave himself; or--or some woman would take, go out with your son, and the same thing. See, he slipped in. The enemy of God slipped in and misinterpreted the Word to Eve.\n\nL-59 Now, he, by this fall, it has took over and possessed the garden of Eden, himself. He took it over. And now he has had six thousand years of deceitful rule; deceiving the people, God's children, as he did then. Because, they were based on free moral agency, to act any way they wished to. And believing that they would act right, or trusting they would act right, then they've come with the wrong act, and sold their birthrights, as Esau did, for the world. And Satan won it, and he took it over. And he's had six thousand years to build up his Eden, as God had six thousand years to bring His Eden to a close. And by deceit, deceit of the Word, or the people, now established his own Eden in this earth, in sin. [Genesis 25:30-34]\n\nL-60 God's Eden was established in righteousness. Satan's Eden is established in sin, because Satan is sin. God is righteousness, and God's kingdom was established in righteousness, and peace, and Life. And Satan's establishment is in sin, and, religious sin.\n\nL-61 Notice how he deceived, his deception, as he said he would. He promised to do this. Did anybody know that? Let us turn to Isaiah, if you want some of these Scriptures. If you... I ought to quote more of them, I guess. Let's turn to Isaiah the 14th chapter, just a moment, and just see what Satan said here, just a moment. In Isaiah 14, we'll read it, and watch what this fellow done. Isaiah 14, begin with the 12th verse. How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars (that's sons), stars of God: and I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation,... the side of the north: And I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; and I will be like the most High. [Isaiah 14:12-14]\n\nL-62 Now compare that over here with our other Scriptures over in Thessalonians, a while ago, how he said, \"He sits in the temple of God, exalting himself above all that's called God, so that he as God is worshiped as God upon the earth.\"\n\nL-63 There is the god of this world that I preached to you about last Sunday. Here he is today in deceit, that treacherous hour, that tremendous time that we're living. It's the most glorious time of all the ages, because we are facing the great Millennium again; we're facing the Eden again. But right at this age, all the deceit and every tactic that he's ever used and been able to deceive with, he's gathered it all together and reinforced hisself; and come down like God, and has put hisself in place of God; religious, and can quote the Scripture and can tell you Scripture, just as Satan did to Eve in the garden of Eden. But leave out one spot of It, is all he has to do, make that gap, where the poison doctrine of the devil can pour through, like the thinking man's Filter we was talking about the other night.\n\nL-64 Now, he said he would exalt himself above the most High; he would ascend above the clouds and the stars, and he 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min would sit there like God, and be above the most High. And he has succeeded in carrying out his threats. He has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats, by the people letting him explain away, in every age, the value of God's promised Word to that age. That's exactly how he's done it. In every age, he explained It away.\n\nL-65 In the days of Noah, he explained that it was impossible for it to rain from heaven, for, \"there is no rain up there.\" His great scientific gospel that he preached in the garden of Eden! He could shoot the instruments to the moon and prove there's no moisture up there. But God said there would come a rain. But Satan succeeded, and poisoned the mind of the people, by scientific research, that, \"it could not be done.\" But it was done. God said it would be done, and it was done. He did. [Genesis 7:11-12], [Genesis 6:17]\n\nL-66 Now, in the days of--of Jesus, he did the same thing. He poisoned their minds again by deceit, see, misinterpreting the Word. \"If Thou be the Son of God, now let me see You do something about it.\"\n\nL-67 Jesus didn't clown for him. He never did. God is not a clown. He don't have to answer anything that Satan asks. He only had... Jesus said, \"It is written, 'Thou shalt not live... Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'\" See, He didn't have to clown, from him. He didn't have to make bread. He could have done it, but He'd a-been listening to the devil, so He didn't have to listen to the devil. [Matthew 4:3-4]\n\nL-68 And again it is religious sin, as at the beginning, so deceitful. Watch it now. It's not just purely old everyday sin, committing adultery and getting drunk, and using God's Name in vain. That's not it. No.\n\nL-69 You remember years ago, many of you here, the oldtimers, remember that sermon I preached, on, The Disappointments At Judgment. The harlot, she ain't going to be disappointed there. She knows where she is going. The drunkard ain't going to be disappointed there. The bootlegger, the gambler, the liar, the thief, he is not going to be disappointed. But, that man who thinks he's right, there's the disappointment.\n\nL-70 That's that fellow, say, come say, \"Lord, haven't I preached the Gospel, have not I cast out devils, in Thy Name?\" [Matthew 7:22]\n\nL-71 Jesus said, \"Depart from you... from Me, you that work iniquity. I never even knew you.\" There's the disappointment, see, that deceitfulness. [Matthew 7:23]\n\nL-72 That's what I'm constantly... that's where I'm so misunderstood. It's not that I want to be different. I don't want to be different, but I've got to be honest. I have a Message, and That must go to the people. Makes it very much misunderstood amongst the people. They think I'm against everybody. They only know, I'm for everybody, and trying my best to bring them what's the Truth, just as it's laid on my heart and the way it's laid in the Bible here. And God proves that to be the Truth, so there is nothing else can be done about it. So, be they look at It, or they don't.\n\nL-73 See, they don't want to see It, because they have already sold out, sold their birthrights to some organization, some denomination; to try their birthrights, to get to Heaven upon the basis of some organized religion, which Satan is the head of every bit of it. God never did have an organized religion, never did. And they sell out to that, where they, a bunch of man, interpret the Word and say It means this and It means that.\n\nL-74 God needs no interpreter. He does His Own interpreting. He doesn't need anyone else to tell Him how to do it. He is sovereign. He said how He would do it, and that's the way He must keep His Word. When He said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe,\" He meant just that. Whatever He said would take place, He said it would happen in these last days, that He would do certain things, and He done it. He has to ask nobody whether it's time or not. He knows what the time is, and what the plan is. [Mark 16:16-17]\n\nL-75 Now, Satan, this deceiver, as spoke of in Matthew 24:24, with so much deceit. Now, we find that by his gospel programs of knowledge, better education, higher ethics, civilization, and so forth, has bewitched the people that wants to serve God, into believing his lie. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-76 Eve did not want to do that, but he showed her how it was more wisdom in it. She didn't know; she wanted to know. She didn't understand, but she wanted to understand. And God told her not to try to understand.\n\nL-77 How can I understand any of these things? I cannot understand them. I believe them. I don't have to understand 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min them. God is faith, and not understanding. We just believe what He said.\n\nL-78 Now, compare God's Eden to Satan's now, after six thousand years of perverting of the true interpretation of God's promised Word to the age. Let's compare it now, and see where we get. Like he did to the church in--in Christ's time, in Jesus, trying to keep--keep back God's loyal sons from knowing the Truth. That's God's. God put His sons here, His attributes, to fellowship with Him by hearing His Word.\n\nL-79 What if your father told you, and you are a loyal son to your father, and he told you, \"Son, don't you go in that water out there, swimming, because there's 'gators in that water\"; and a fellow comes back, said, \"Surely, such pretty water as that, there is no 'gators in it\"? Now who you going to listen to? If you're a genuine son, you'll listen to your daddy.\n\nL-80 And a genuine son or daughter of God takes God's Word first. I don't care what anybody else says about it, they take God's Word first. \"There's poison in the cup,\" and they believe it.\n\nL-81 Having faith in all His Word, His Seeds, brought a Eden of holiness, love, and Eternal Life. That's what God's Eden produced, holiness. And it brought an Eden of holiness, of love, understanding, perfection, and Eternal Life. That's what God is planting, His Word, His Seed. That's what His Church will be at the end; It will be the same thing.\n\nL-82 Notice, here's a thought. Don't forget it. I'll get to it some other time or some other Message. But, you know, God said, \"Let every seed bring forth of its kind.\" Is that God's commandment? Now what good is any preacher, or anybody else, try to make that Word say something else? See, every Word of God is a Seed. Jesus said so, \"A Seed a sower sowed.\" So if Mark 16 is God's Word, it'll bring forth of its kind. If Malachi 4 is God's Word, it'll bring forth of its kind. And every other promise must bring forth of its kind. [Genesis 1:11-12]\n\nL-83 You see, see Satan out here in disguisement? He is trying to say, \"It not, it's not so.\" Do you understand it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] See, Satan say, \"Oh, That ain't for this day. That, that--that's... That was some other time. That, that don't even mean that.\"\n\nL-84 \"Every seed must come forth of its kind.\" That's how God established His Eden. Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] And here it is, that's how God establishes His Church, every Word after Its kind! \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word proceeding out of the mouth of God.\" See? Satan, he'll take something else. But God said, \"Every seed after its kind.\" [Genesis 1:11], [Matthew 4:4], [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-85 If the promise said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\"\n\nL-86 Now the church says, \"Join the church. Recite the creed. Know the catechism.\" There is not such things in the whole Bible.\n\nL-87 But Jesus said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe: in My Name they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; if they take up serpents, or drink deadly things, it won't harm them; if they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" Who is any man to deny That? See? [Mark 16:16-17]\n\nL-88 \"Every seed will bring forth of its kind.\" If you are a seed of God, an attribute, a son of God, then the Word of God is sown in you. See? And then when you hear the Word of God, \"My sheep hear My Voice; a stranger they won't follow.\" You get it? \"Then every seed comes forth after its own kind.\" [John 10:2-5]\n\nL-89 Now we find out, that every seed bringing forth of its kind, there was no death in the new... in that Eden. There will be no death in the new Eden. See, there was no, nothing else but holiness, purity, and Eternal Life.\n\nL-90 Now, by unbelief in all of God's Word, has brought the seed of unholiness in Satan's Eden. We are now entering in where Satan is taking the throne, as the antichrist, in a--a Eden of this earth, a Eden of sin, perverted religion. He started not upon, \"I am Satan. I am the great angel.\" No, not upon that, but upon perverting God's Word. And that's how he's brought his kingdom, in every age. And now in this great deceitful age, ready to take his throne, by his people! He has built hisself an intellectual, educated, scientific Eden; right, scientific preachers, scientific church, scientific theology, everything is scientific. Everything is on basis of knowledge. The whole church is built upon knowledge. It ain't built upon faith. 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min\n\nL-91 One time I went in to hold a meeting to a man's church. It was a great auditorium in the west. A fine man, and he denied these things that we're talking about. But yet, he was... I liked him; fine man, old man. When his congregation went out... It seated about six thousand people. When his congregation went out, in the afternoon service, about fifteen hundred, they were all fine-dressed intellectuals. I sat there and watched them.\n\nL-92 He preached a very good sermon, the man did. And then he asked if anybody wanted to accept Christ; just to raise up their hands. And no one raised up their hands. And finally a woman raised up her hands. He said, \"All right, now you're a Christian,\" and made her for baptism. And then when he went out... He dedicated a baby, kissed the little baby and made a prayer over it, and dismissed the audience.\n\nL-93 When his congregation went out; all fine, scholarly, educated people. Then I was standing on the side, to shake the man's hand and wish him God's speed, as he went out.\n\nL-94 And when I did, here came my crowd in. They couldn't let them in while his crowd was there. Here come mine, in wheel chairs, stretchers, strait jackets, insane, and everything else. You see the difference? That's it. That's the thing I'm talking about, see. See, it's something different.\n\nL-95 When, by scientific knowledge you can make a understanding Gospel, that, you, \"he that believeth on Jesus Christ shall not be condemned,\" see.\n\nL-96 But, \"These signs shall follow them that believe,\" see, he fails to put That in there, see. She believed on Jesus Christ, she is saved, if these signs follow the believer.\n\nL-97 \"And he that heareth My Word,\" not just makes out, not hear It with his ears, but, \"understand It.\" Anybody can hear It; a prostitute can hear It and remain a prostitute; see, a drunkard can hear It; a liar can hear It and still remain a liar. But, \"He that understandeth My Word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life.\" There you are, see. [John 5:24]\n\nL-98 And no man can do that except God foreordained him. Jesus said, \"No man can come to Me, except My Father draws him, and all the Father has given Me will come to Me.\" Amen. It's all the sovereignty and foreknowledge of God. He lives alone and there's nobody tells Him what to do. [John 6:44, 65]\n\nL-99 Now, by unbelief, in no taking all the Word of God, has brought a seed of unbelief, unholy, sinful, hatred, and Eternal death is in this sinful, intellectual church age. Now you got it? In this day, that when the whole world is religious! Did you know that? The whole world is religious. And in this religious age, big churches on every corner; everything, the whole thing winds up in Satan being worshiped. Here it is, right here in the Bible. That's right. And in this intellectual, theological seminaries that's brought out an intellectual person that's been trained how to speak, what to do, how to make their emotions; and everything like psychology, three and four years, to know how to deal with a man's mind. See, it's...\n\nL-100 The Spirit of God is not something that, you, it's schooled into you. It's something that's predestinated into you, by the hand of Almighty God. Your experiences cannot be schooled or taught into you. It's predestinated, by God's hand and God's foreknowledge, into you. That's right.\n\nL-101 Now, it brought forth this great Eden that they now live in, a church world's Eden. They're all uniting together now at the great Ecumenical Council, and going to have the world church all coming under one head, where Satan will be throned, just exactly.\n\nL-102 And the last call is going out, to catch the Bride before She gets into that. For once in that, she's took the mark of the beast, and doomed, she'll never come out of it. That's the reason, say, \"Come out from among them, My people,\" before it goes into him, see. \"Come out from among them, and be ye separated.\" [II Corinthians 6:17]\n\nL-103 Now, hatred and death, and Eternal separation from God, in this Eden; lust, filth, perversion, (how?) by sowing the wrong seed.\n\nL-104 Reminds me of the vision I seen before I ever met the Pentecostal people, of that Man going around the world, in white. You've heard me tell it many times. And one come in behind Him, sowing seeds of discord. 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min\n\nL-105 But he won it fairly, in Eve... in the garden of Eden, by the lust of Eve for sin; the lust for Eve, of sin. Then, if Eve lusted for knowledge, it was sin.\n\nL-106 And when we lust for knowledge, want a Ph.D., LL.D., it's sin to do so. That's strong statements, but that's the Truth. No matter how strong it is, it's still the Truth, see. To lust for knowledge, understanding!\n\nL-107 The thing of it is, is, today we don't try to establish the Word of God in the people's hearts. We are trying to establish ourselves. Churches are trying to establish the doctrine of the church, in a person's heart.\n\nL-108 We are commanded to establish the Word of God. Paul said, \"I didn't come to you with enticing words of man, that your faith might rest up in the knowledge of man; but I come to you in power; in manifestations of the Holy Ghost, that your faith might rest in God.\" There you are. [I Corinthians 2:4]\n\nL-109 Man mustn't establish yourself. We find it amongst... Let God do something for a person and send him out, you find every man trying to impersonate it. See, they're trying to establish themselves. Every man, \"I did this. Me, I, mine, my denomination, me, this,\" establishing themselves. What are we preaching about, ourselves or the Kingdom of God?\n\nL-110 Establish the Word of God. Take out the unbelief and establish the Kingdom of God in a man's heart. And the Kingdom of God cannot be established in a man's heart 'less God made that man thus. He cannot be established in a...\n\nL-111 And, remember, the deceitful part, that man think that it's right. \"There is a way that seemeth right unto a man.\" Every intellectual being seems right. [Proverbs 14:12]\n\nL-112 As I told you a few Sundays ago; when I stood by my dying baby, and Satan standing there and said, \"There is your daddy, died in your arms the other night. There is your wife laying down there in a--in the morgue, and here is your baby going. And you asked Him to answer you, and He pulled your... He pulled a shade down over you. Now, and yet He's a good God, and yet you said He was a Healer. And you, who are standing for what you said was right, you're wrong.\" Oh, every reason, every mental faculty had to agree that it was right; and he was right, that much.\n\nL-113 So was he right when he told Eve, \"Your eyes will be opened, and you'll know right from wrong. And you'll be as gods, that way, knowing right from wrong,\" because God didn't let them see themselves yet, that they were naked. So they knowed they would know right from wrong; and he was right. But, you see, it was contrary to the Word of God. [Genesis 3:5]\n\nL-114 And so does ministers in seminaries, learning man-made theology; it may seem right, it may be a good understanding of the thing, but it's wrong.\n\nL-115 We don't have to understand It. We believe It because God said it's so, and that settles it forever. The whole thing, that's the way to believe It.\n\nL-116 Oh, how Eve lusted to have a Ph.D., see, how she lusted to be smarter than what she was!\n\nL-117 Notice how much alike, man and his wife... Now notice, man and wife, both naked in the garden of Eden, God's Eden.\n\nL-118 Now I'm going to close. I said I'm going to hold just a few minutes. Look, watch now, as closing.\n\nL-119 Compare this now, how much alike that man and his wife, both in God's Eden, without one stitch of clothes on them, and knew it not. For why didn't they know it? For they were veiled to their senses of nakedness, by the Holy Veil, of the Holy Spirit. They could look right at each other, and they didn't know that they were naked. They were veiled with the Holy Spirit, of holiness. They were veiled.\n\nL-120 God's veil, yet today, can look and not lust. They turn their head. It's a Holy Veil, see, Holy Veil. God had their eyes... they were both, one was man and the other was woman, and they did not know they were naked, because the holiness of God kept their eyes veiled. Notice, God hid their conscience from sin, by the Holy Veil.\n\nL-121 Wish we had some time to lay on that, a few minutes. Looky here, \"For he, the worshiper once purged,\" Hebrews, \"the worshiper once purged, has no more conscience of sin.\" Sin has passed from him. [Hebrews 10:2]\n\nL-122 I heard Brother Neville say, this morning; someone might have been asking him why didn't I preach on the Holy 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min Ghost, why didn't I do this. Here it is. The Holy Ghost is the action in you. It's a Life, not an emotion; not some sort of a fleshly evidence. But It is a Person, Jesus Christ, the Word of God established in your heart, to quicken every Word of this age. Right. Watch the Holy Ghost in action, not so much in demonstrations; but, in action, what It does according to the Word.\n\nL-123 Notice now the Holy Spirit, of God's Holy Word, had a man and woman naked, and didn't know it. How beautiful, Life of the Word; the Seed, the Word!\n\nL-124 God said, \"There is a tree in the midst of the garden, the woman. And in the midst of the garden is this tree; don't even touch it. For, the day you eat thereof, that day you die.\" They were holy veiled from it, didn't know nothing about it, daresn't to touch it. [Genesis 2:8-9]\n\nL-125 They were holy veiled. They were safe in God's pavilion. They were alive. They had no death around them. Hallelujah! They had perfect love one for the other, perfect Life forever. They had perfect love, perfect understanding of the love of God. They had God's Word, and kept It. And they were alive and safe in God's Eden, with no death at all around them. [Genesis 2:15-17]\n\nL-126 Then, Satan got Eve to listen to his gospel of theology, the gospel of knowledge, higher schooling, higher ethics, better civilization, higher education, and so forth; then when he got the... her to stop and listen to him a minute, to his reasonings (which we are commanded to cast down), when he got her to listen to it. [Genesis 3:1-10]\n\nL-127 \"Now, looky here, the church is so-and-so. It's been established for so long. We're one of the oldest churches in the country. The mayor of the city goes.\" I don't care what it is, see. If it's against God's Word, be against it. That's your enemy. Anything that's against the Word is your enemy.\n\nL-128 Everything that's for the Word is your brother. He's a part of you.\n\nL-129 Notice, she pulled off the Holy Veil, to see what sex really was; compare that, what lust really would do. She pulled the Veil from off her eyes, the holy thing that God had put over her eyes. She wanted knowledge, to know what it was all about; so she pulled the Veil off to see what it was all about. She listened to the devil, and notice what a place it put her in. [Genesis 3:1-10]\n\nL-130 They have done the same in each age thereafter, always taking the intellectual side; and has now built a kingdom of Satan, knowledge, his seed that he sowed, and has took the world to be an Eden of death.\n\nL-131 Now notice. Now look at Revelations 3, the Laodicean Church Age. You think it in your mind.\n\nL-132 Now notice. She, Eve, is Satan's queen. See, Satan, the serpent, got to Eve before Adam got to her. See? That's right. So he beguiled her, see; so Satan, the serpent, was the husband of Eve before Adam ever knew. See, he beguiled her. The Bible said he did, and she knowed she was naked, then. See? [Genesis 3:13-14]\n\nL-133 Now look at the--the Laodicean Church Age. She, Eve, is sitting as Satan's queen. \"She is rich in worldly goods; blind, naked again, and don't know it,\" just like it was in God's Eden. But now, not because the Holy Veil is over her face, but the lust veil. That, she took off God's Holy Veil, and put on a veil of knowledge, for lust. And now she has a lust veil, that she is \"blind\" to it being sin. She is \"naked\" on the street, \"and don't know it.\" She's a prostitute on the street. Women with these shorts on, in God's sight, is a prostitute, \"and don't know it.\" [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-134 Notice, take our women. Now, if you want to see what condition the church is in, watch the way women are acting. She always represents the church. In Satan's Eden, of sin and unbelief, a religious perversion; perverted kingdom. Instead of taking God's Word, they have took the intellectual learning of man. And instead of taking the Church, they took the organization, and they're bringing it to one great head.\n\nL-135 Now notice, perverted from innocence. Don't miss this now. The church has been with this lust veil on. Notice what it's done to her. It's--it's perverted her from innocence to knowledge. See? The Holy Veil, she was innocent; with the lust veil, she is knowledge. She knows it's pleasant. She knows what it does, see. It's a fruit, a tree to be desired, making one wise. See? She is perverted from innocent to knowledge, from holiness to filth and lust, and from Life to death. 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min\n\nL-136 This kingdom has to die. This kingdom shall die! The God of Heaven will destroy it from the face of the earth. Notice, in this perversion, it's become from a man to a woman, and from a woman to a man, \"and don't know it.\" A very good product of Satan's Eden, if you'll watch the streets today, at our modern people. [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-139 Notice, it was Eve that Satan used to make Adam sin by her power of lust. Now the same, doing the same thing today. Notice, bobbed hair, painted face-e, sexually dressed, see, she does that, and don't know that every one of those things is contrary to the Word of God. To cut her hair, makes her a dishonorable woman, a prostitute. To wear shorts, puts her disgracefully. Put sexy dresses on her, makes her a prostitute. \"And she don't know it,\" not because of the holiness of God; because the lust of Satan. She caused her... She causes her Adam to lust for her.\n\nL-140 She took off the clothes that God dressed her in, back in Eden, for her journey through the--this wilderness. She took them off. She stripped herself down. When, God had her wrapped all over in skins; she's begin to shave a little off each time, now she is back to where she was at the beginning.\n\nL-141 Now she has got her Adam to wearing her underneath clothes. A man put on them little old sissy-looking shorts, and get out here, I don't think there is much man to him. He is the biggest sissy I know of. See? See, she has got her perverted Adam to act like she, see, wearing her underneath clothes. She seen what she could do out yonder when she took off all of her clothes but her underneath ones. That's the shorts. Course, that's the woman's underneath clothes, and here her Adam is wearing them now. Which, according to God's original Word, \"Is an abomination for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man, and a man to put on a garment pertains to a woman,\" from the original Word. Think of it! [Deuteronomy 22:5]\n\nL-142 Now, he now wears her bangs, also. He combs them down, puts a curler in them. Some of the most sickly sights I've ever seen in my life, is some of those kids out here today with their bangs combed down like this, and colored, bleached hair, with some kind of a peroxide something, and bleach their hair, and rolling it in curlers, making bangs. You big sissy! That's a horrible thing to say from a pulpit, but judgment begins at the house of God. You don't even know whether you're a man or woman. And I understand that our United States Army is coming out next in shorts. That's right. See what the perversion is? It's a woman's clothes; wears her bangs.\n\nL-143 The other day I was over, Howard Johnson's; not this one here, but one on the road going out. And I just sat back in amazement. Here come a little boy along, his mouth open. And he had dark hair here, and it combed it over this a way; and put a roller in it, and curled it up around, top of his eyes; looking out the top of his eyes, going around. If I ever seen a perversion! See, he wouldn't believe it. He could prove maybe he was male, but in his spirit he is female. He don't know what side of the house he belongs on. That's right. How perverted!\n\nL-144 That's what Satan does. He perverts the nations. He perverts the church. He perverts the people. He is a deceiver, a perverter of the original Truth. [Revelation 19:20-21]\n\nL-145 God made a man a man. He made a woman a woman. And He dressed them different, and He meant for them to stay that way and to act that way; one is feminish, and the other is masculine. He separated Adam in the garden of Eden, and did this, separated Eve from him.\n\nL-146 Now wears her bangs; she cuts her hair like his, and he tries to wear his like hers. See? She wears his outside clothes, and he wears her inside clothes. Now, that sounds sacrilegious, but I don't mean it that way. It's the absolute Gospel Truth. If you don't know it, then there's something wrong with you; you're either blind or never been on the streets. And she thinks and he thinks that it's right, they're getting along somewhere. Women says, \"Well, it's so hot!\"\n\nL-147 The old Apache Indians out yonder would make you ashamed of yourself. The more heat they get, the more clothes they put on, to keep the sun off of them; oh, make it sweat, so you can have an air-conditioner as they walk. See? They stand right out in the sun.\n\nL-148 You couldn't stand nothing; you would blister and burn. But, you see, it's what you call higher education. Modern science has produced this. Oh, my! There she is, \"naked,\" in Laodicea, \"and don't know it.\" 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min\n\nL-149 She was naked in Eden. See the two kingdoms alike? One is of sin and death; the other one is Life and righteousness. In there she was veiled with a Holy Veil. They were both naked; they didn't know it. They didn't know nothing about it, because they were veiled with God's Spirit. [Genesis 3:10-11], [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-150 And here they are veiled with lust, and they look at one another to... See, Adam could look at Eve, and didn't know she was naked. But now with this lust veil, she doesn't realize she is naked, but she does it under this lust veil to make man look at her. It's the only thing she can do it for. You don't believe that, but you do it anyhow, and man look. And he found out you got so much attraction, till he come around and put some of your clothes on himself. [Genesis 3:10-11], [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-151 Oh, what a perversion! What a age! What a time we're... How deceitful it is! Oh, all these things, \"and don't know it,\" a perfect perverted spirit is in the man. He is veiled from the lust of Satan, and the woman is, too. It's a satanic spirit of a great society. See, they don't know, but they're a organization. Women with shorts on, belongs to an organization. Man dressed like that, is on a organization. I'll give you the abbreviation of it, B.S.S., Big Sister Society, so that's what they belong to. Come out there, a big sissy society, with them little old pants on, big old knotty-looking, dirty-looking thing. I--I... [Galatians 1:7]\n\nL-152 Man, now you may differ me with this, but that's the Truth. You have been perverted and don't know it. You're not, don't act like a man no more. See, coming so soft; and, their son, will be nothing to them anymore; man, and women, too. They are a society. There is a organization. Why? \"John, next door, wore shorts, so why can't I? Luella wanted me to wear them because John wore them, next door. And, well, if--if Susie Jane can wear them, so can Martha Jane wear them, or Susie Lou,\" or ever who her name is, see. See, it's a society. It's an organization. You spiritually belong to it, and don't know it. [Galatians 1:7]\n\nL-153 And if that's so, and we see it's so, so are you blinded. You are blinded to these denominations that Satan has twisted you into. And it's the perversion of God's original Word, and His Kingdom, and His plan for His children. Satan has twisted men and women into these things, and they don't know it. A perverted! [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-154 No longer a son of God! Bangs hanging down in his face, and a pair of shorts on, trucking down the street; a son of God, deacon in a church, a pastor in a pulpit? No, that ain't a son of God. He never came through God's thinking Filter. He wouldn't have them women's clothes on; he sure wouldn't; neither would she have the man's clothes on. See, it's not a son of God. It's a son of Satan, and a daughter of Satan. Hard thing to say!\n\nL-155 Satan has succeeded in perverting and taking over this world, and making it his kingdom; that man was put on, by free moral agency, to choose for themselves what kind of life they desired. And that shows what's in your heart. See? Your voice... You know what? Your actions speak so loud, it drowns your voice.\n\nL-156 Let me go to a man. And say, \"Oh, I... We're all Christians. We belong to church.\" And strip teases hanging all over his office? It wouldn't make no difference what he told me, I would know better; so would you.\n\nL-157 Let a women say she's a Christian, with short hair? Huh-uh! You know better than that, see. Yes, sir. Let her say she's a Christian, wearing paint and make-up, and shorts, and say she's a Christian? You know better than that. The Word of God teaches you better than that. The Word says she can't do it and be a Christian. She is even dishonorable, and everything. How is God going to put a dishonorable thing in His kingdom? No, sir, not at all. No, sir. Theirselves, they shows their desire. [I Corinthians 11:2-10]\n\nL-158 You can't get a dove to eat with a buzzard, not at all. A dove don't have any gall. He can't eat that old a carrion. If he took a bite of it, it would kill him, and he knows it. But a buzzard can eat most anything he wants to. See? He's got plenty of gall.\n\nL-159 So then you find out, that's the way it is with the world today, same thing, \"They are naked, blind, and don't know it.\" [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-160 Satan did it by the woman's lust for knowledge, for sex, which she chose by her own choosing. Now notice, it was Eve that led Adam to the wrong, and it was the woman that took off her clothes before her Adam took off his. See? 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min It's the woman, always. It's always been. It still is the same way.\n\nL-161 It's the church that leads the man astray. It's the church, see, that leads the man that wanted to be a son of God. It's the woman, the church. Not the Bible, God, for the Bible is man. Oh, yeah, \"the Word was made flesh,\" and He was a Man. See? The Bible is man; the church is woman. See? It isn't the church... the Bible that leads the man astray. It's the church that leads him astray. It's the church he went naked with, not the Bible. See? No, indeed. The Bible tells him he's naked. Yes, sir. [I Timothy 4:1], [II Timothy 3:1-5], [John 1:14], [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-162 Now notice how, by sex, desire of sex, she lusted for knowledge, to know what was this, and how, whether this fruit was good or not. And she did it.\n\nL-163 God will take it back someday, though, by a Man. It was surrendered by a woman. But it was redeemed by a Man; the Man, Jesus Christ, which is the Word.\n\nL-164 And then what is it? Notice, in closing. Here not long ago, I made this statement. I got about four or five more pages in there, but I... of Scriptures and things I wanted to refer to. But, listen. Let's close, in saying this.\n\nL-165 Remember, here not long ago, I was teaching you on the Seven Trumpets, the feast of trumpets, and so forth. And I said, \"There is a eighth-day festival.\" So, the seventh day would be the last, that would be the Millennium. But there is an eighth-day festival; which, if it was the eighth, and there's only seven days, would make it the first day again, come right back to the first day. Then, after the Millennium is over, then there will be an established Eden again. God's great Kingdom will be taken back. Because, Jesus fought it out with Satan, in the garden of Gethsemane, and won back the Eden; which, He's gone to prepare in Heaven, to return again, up in Heaven. He said, \"Let not your hearts be troubled.\" [John 14:1]\n\nL-166 When He was here on earth, He said, \"You, you Jews, you've believed in God. Now, I know I got a bad name,\" He said. \"And they say I'm this, that, the other. But, you've believed in God; and as you've believed in God, believe also in Me.\" He was God, manifested. See? \"Believe also in...\"\n\nL-167 \"In My Father's house are many...\" Or, \"In My Father's economy, in My Father's plans is many palaces. I'll go to prepare a place.\" Look how long it is, fifteen hundred square miles! Say, where's it at? He has gone to prepare it. He is Creator. He creates all that gold. The streets are transparent. He is Creator. He is making a place. Over in Revelation 21, he said, \"And I John saw the holy City, the New Jerusalem, descending from God out of Heaven.\" [John 14:2-3], [Revelation 21:1-2]\n\nL-168 \"There was no more sea; the first heaven and first earth was passed away.\" What was our first heavens? Was the Millennium. What's the first earth? Was this. It'll be renovated. Just like it was baptized by Noah, in the days of his preaching; was sanctified by Christ, as He sprinkled His Blood upon it; and be renovated, take all the germs and everything off of it, in the renovation at the end, with a Fire baptism that'll kill every germ, every sickness, every disease, every filth that was ever on the earth. [Revelation 21:1-3]\n\nL-169 She'll burst forth, and come forth a New Earth. \"And I saw a New Heaven and a New Earth. First heaven, this first earth, was passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy City, the New Jerusalem, descending from God out of Heaven.\" There God will be with His true attributes, sons and daughters, where He can fellowship with them in holiness, with their eyes blinded to any sin. There'll never be no more sin from there on. [Revelation 21:1-3]\n\nL-170 Let us strive hard; don't be deceived in this day, but, \"strive to enter in at the gate.\"\n\nL-171 \"For all that will be left out will be whoremongers, lusters.\" \"Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already.\" All with... outside will be ill-fame women, ill-fame man, and so forth. [Matthew 5:28]\n\nL-172 And only those that are redeemed, and in the Lamb's Book of Life, will enter in at the gate. So strive, friends; don't be deceived in this last day.\n\nL-173 This is a great time. Everybody has got money. Everybody can do this, and everybody can do that, and money flowing every way, and big cars, and everything. There won't be one of them in that City. There won't be one car, one 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min airplane. No. It'll be a altogether a different civilization. It'll be again a civilization not of knowledge, not of science, but of innocence, and faith in the living God.\n\nL-174 Let us strive to enter into That. For that's my whole purpose, is to enter into that City some day; and just look back, coming along with me, see every one of you marching, when we sing, \"the saints go marching in.\" I want to be in that number when the saints go marching in. Let us pray.\n\nL-175 Dear Heavenly Father, as the days are closing, and we see it drawing nigh, the promise is drawing nigh. We pray, Dear God, that You'll place that upon our hearts, so we won't make any mistake. Dear God, keep our conscience pure. Keep our hearts veiled, Lord, our eyes veiled from the things of the world, and vain things of the world, vain glory to become some big somebody.\n\nL-176 No matter how big they are, all kings, monarchs, potentates, and everything else has to perish, and they will not rise in the sec-... in the first resurrection. For it's written, \"Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection, on which the second death has no power.\" O God! \"The second death,\" the spiritual death, \"has no power\"; he is redeemed! [Revelation 20:6]\n\nL-177 O God, to think that one of these hours, one will be going to visit the other, and be caught up. \"Two in a bed; will take one, and leave one. Two in the field; I'll take one, and leave one.\" [Matthew 24:40-41]\n\nL-178 O God, help us to be pure in--in the sight of You, Lord, no matter what man thinks about us, what other people say. Lord, let our holy... our conversations be holy. Let it be seasoned with God's Word; so seasonable, Lord, that there's no guile found in us. While we plead, in our own mistakes, that the Blood of Jesus Christ will stand between us and God, that He'll look down upon us through the Blood of Jesus; not upon our own righteous, or who we are, what we've done, but upon His merits alone. God, grant it!\n\nL-179 May not one who sit here tonight and heard the Message, may not one of them be lost, from the least child to the oldest person. May their holy desire be only for God and His Word. We know not what hour He may appear, or what hour He may summons us to answer up yonder at the Judgment. We don't know what hour He may, as it was, take our card from the rack, say, \"It's homecoming time. You've got to go.\" God, help us to keep pure. Grant it, Lord.\n\nL-180 May we live till the Coming of the Lord, if it be possible. May we do everything that's in our power, with love and understanding, understanding that God is searching the world, today, finding every lost sheep. And may we talk to them with seasoned prayer of love and the Word of God, that we might find that last one, so we can go Home, and get out of this old Eden of Satan here, Lord.\n\nL-181 That's all built upon lust, and beautiful women, as so-called in the world, with their advertisements on there, \"We advertise, and want boys to come with jam on their faces, and pretty girls with shorts on,\" right on our radios and televisions; and all kind of filth and gaum, and Hollywood; all kinds of sexy, dirty, filthy dresses for women. And--and man being perverted and taking women's apparel, and cutting their hair like women; and women like man.\n\nL-182 O God, what a horrible hour we're living in! Oh, come, Lord Jesus, come! Come, Lord! Cleanse us by the Blood. Take all filth and guile away from us. Let us live, Lord, let us live under the Blood, constantly, before You. It's our hearts' desire, and our sincere plea.\n\nL-183 Dear God, laying on this plat-... or those, desk, tonight, where the Gospel has been laid. Lord, here lies handkerchiefs and little parcels that go unto the sick and afflicted. Let the prayer of faith, Lord, fall from our hearts now, in Your sight. Then, Lord, if there be any unclean thing in us, Lord, take our... take us to judgment now; and we plead for mercy. Reveal to us what we're doing wrong, Lord, so we can ask, to take the Blood and cleanse us. Heal these sick people and make them well, Father, whatever it go unto, wherever they go. Let it be so, Father.\n\nL-184 Give us the determination to serve You, and You only. Grant it, Lord.\n\nL-185 Grant safety to these dear people that's on the road home.\n\nL-186 Thank You for how You've healed the people. And Sister Shepherd and Brother Shepherd's little boy, hurt on the 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min bicycle, I pray that no evil will come to that; the little fellow riding his bicycle, I pray that he'll be all right. We thank You for Your healing of these others that we've asked for. \"And we know that what we ask, we receive, because we have confidence in the One that made the promise.\"\n\nL-187 Give us of Thy grace, Lord, and forgive us of our sins, we ask in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-188 Do you love Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Do you believe Him? [\"Amen.\"] Are you sick and tired of Satan's kingdom? [\"Amen.\"] Do you believe it's coming to the Millennium, unto His Millennium; His, to His Eden? [\"Amen.\"]\n\nL-189 You believe it's been formed today? Look, everything is based upon intellectuals. All, everything, has to be scientifically proved before they'll believe it.\n\nL-190 And you cannot scientifically prove God. You have to accept Him by faith, \"For he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him.\" [Hebrews 11:6]\n\nL-191 O God, I don't want to know nothing but the Blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses me from sin. I know nothing but Jesus Christ. And as Paul said of old, so say I tonight, \"I know nothing among you, only save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.\" [I John 1:7], [I Corinthians 2:2]\n\nL-192 That's all I know to tell you. That, this Bible, I believe with all my heart (if I know my heart), to be the perfect unadulterated Word of God. By This I live. By This I stand. And if I had ten thousand lives, I'd like to give every bit of it for this Word, for it's the Word of Jesus Christ. And I don't care how much they can try to disprove It, how much science tries to say It isn't trustworthy, and so forth. To me, It's the only thing in the world I can trust, is this Word. He is mine. I love Him. Don't you? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-193 If there's a sin in your heart, if there's a fault in your heart, if you've got anything, pray now and ask God to forgive you. You pray for me; I'll pray for you. God bless you, is my prayer. Till we meet! till we meet! God be with you till we meet again!\n\nL-194 Do you love one another? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] John said, \"Little children, love one another.\" \"Love one another, for love covers a multitude of sins.\" Now let us shake one another's hand. [I John 4:7, 11-12] God be with you till we meet again! Till we meet! till we meet!\n\nL-195 Now be kind to one another. Be kind to everybody. Treat your neighbor right. Keep yourself unspotted till Jesus comes. ... feet; Till we meet! till we meet! God be with you till we meet again!\n\nL-196 You love Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] That's my prayer. You pray for me; I'll pray for you. I got to go back to Tucson now. And I--I pray that God will bless you all. I'm going from there to Canada, and back to Colorado; around, around, around, see. Until...?...\n\nL-197 Brother Tony is over there, and a great thing has happened. Right under the Vatican, in Rome, they're calling for a revival, a meeting, for me to come there and hold a revival in Rome, in Rome. He just returned back. The people is all together. They got a great arena there, seats thousands and thousands, and they want me come for a revival. They want to see the glory of the Lord in the ministry. I don't know. I have to pray over it, see what the Lord will tell me. Oh, my! Remember, pray, all of us together. We're working... We're watching for the coming of our blessed Saviour, Lo, and behold the fig leaves now becoming green; The Gospel of His Kingdom has gone to every nation; And we're near the end, can be seen. 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min\n\nL-198 Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Then gladly away we'll herald the Message of His blessed appearing, Soon He's coming in glory, to tell to one and all; Then awake, ye saints of the Lord, why slumber when the end is nearing, Let's get ready for that final call.\n\nL-199 She'll turn at the west and ride back again, one of these days, just remember. She sure will. And that's right. Until then: Take the Name of Jesus with you, Child of sorrow and of woe; It will joy and comfort give you, Take it, everywhere you go. Precious Name (precious Name), O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven; Precious Name, O how sweet! (how sweet!) Hope of earth and joy of Heaven. At the Name of Jesus bowing, Falling prostrate at His feet, King of kings in Heaven we'll crown Him, When our journey is complete. Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven; Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven.\n\nL-200 Now, on this last verse, let's sing it with bowed hearts now. Take the Name of Jesus with you, As a shield from every snare; And when temptations around you gather, (these things of Satan's kingdom, see, see) Just breathe that holy Name in prayer.\n\nL-201 That's all; then walk away. It works. I've tried it. Just believe it now, 'cause it will work. Just breathe His holy Name in prayer. ... the Name of Jesus with you, As a shield from every snare; When temptations round you gather, (What do you do then?) Just breathe that holy Name in prayer. (The Veil will come over your face then.) Precious Name (precious Name), O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven; Precious Name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of Heaven.\n\nL-202 Let us bow our heads now, while I ask Brother Beeler back there to come here to the platform. [Brother Branham begins humming Take The Name Of Jesus With You--Ed.] Just breathe His holy Name in prayer.\n\nL-203 You dismiss us, Brother Beeler. You dismiss us in prayer. Precious Name, Hope of earth and joy of Heaven; Precious Name (precious Name), O how sweet! 65-0829, Satan's Eden, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 85 min Hope of earth and joy of Heaven.\n\nL-204 Now with our heads bowed, and our hearts bowed.

[\"Sure be really a privilege to have Brother Branham come so often to Phoenix. I think he comes to Phoenix more than anywhere. And we want him to keep coming, just as long as I'm around here, anyway. God bless you, Brother Branham.\"] Thank, thank you, Brother Williams. Good morning, friends. I am... This of the Shakarian family, Brother Williams and Sister Williams and many of them here know about it. I saw that in a vision, about two to three years before she got sick, and it happened.\n\nL-2 And last year when we were here, I believe it was in January, at the convention, it was the time that that priest (what's his name? I forget his name now) was here. [Someone says, \"Stanley.\"--Ed.] Stanley, Bishop Stanley, from the Catholic church. You remember when he brought me the Bible, you know, and he said to me. It was several prophesying, \"My daughter, you are healed.\"\n\nL-3 And he knew that the vision had said that she would not get well. \"She would die between two and three o'clock in the morning.\" Remember that? [Someone says, \"Yes.\"--Ed.] So, two or three o'clock.\n\nL-4 And I couldn't tell Demos. And yet I told her stepmother, right over in the room, right across the place here. I said, \"She isn't going to get well.\" Mrs. Shakarian said, \"Well, everybody is prophesying.\" I said, \"Course, I could be wrong, myself, but I said it. She isn't going to get well.\"\n\nL-5 I told many of them, about three years ago, \"I saw her running for her life, and she went into a bed. And she raised her hands and screamed to me, like that. And I--I couldn't even reach her. And then I seen her die. And I looked, and there was something, there was a clock, and it said it's something between two and three o'clock.\"\n\nL-6 And so the bishop said, \"Well, I'll just watch and see how that comes to pass.\" So, it did come to pass.\n\nL-7 We are certainly sorry. I feel the church has lost a great person, in Sister Florence Shakarian. But, she was a great singer, she was a Spirit-filled woman.\n\nL-8 I was with her mother; her mother was one of the first contacts I had on the West Coast, when her mother was healed. When the doctors... She was in a coma, and all swollen up. And so the--the doctor that was there told me, said, \"Now be real quiet when you pray. Don't make much noise. The woman is dying.\" I said, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nL-9 And he said, then, just kept on telling me. And, well, I didn't even have a chance to open my mouth, like.\n\nL-10 So, it was Brother Demos told me to go ahead and go up and see her.\n\nL-11 So, I went upstairs. And Florence was kneeling on the floor, then a beautiful little girl, and some more women. And went over and prayed for her, and told it. And she was unconscious. And told her she would get up again. And she did. A couple years later, she died. And now God answers our prayers.\n\nL-12 And we know that, we believe that we all have come here by the will of God, and we believe the same way. One by one, we'll each one cross that portal. And that's why we're here this morning, gathered together in this Christian Business Men's Fellowship, is to speak of these things, and prepare for them, 'cause we know they are sure to come.\n\nL-13 Now Sister Florence is a young woman, forty-two years old, Brother Williams just told me, and very young. But before they, she knew that she had this disease, why, I saw a vision of her and told me her outcome. Then, it would be. God knows all about it, and her seeing Jesus in the room before she left. We just don't want to pray for her, because we've done that so much. We just want to thank God for a life that was among us, that inspired us all, as Sister Shakarian.\n\nL-14 And we want to pray for Brother Demos and Sister Rose. And remember, they've had an awful hard hit in their life, 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min in the last... it's his father, and his sister now in his... the last years. [Somebody speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] But, and, yeah, less than, less, ten months; and sister, Sister Edna, also.\n\nL-15 So, I know how to sympathize with Brother Demos. I had a father, brother, wife, and baby, to go within a few days apart, so I--I know how he feels this morning. You only know when you stand in them shoes, that's when you know how to sympathize. And...\n\nL-16 [The amplifying system squeals--Ed.] I did that myself. Excuse me. I hit a little gadget down here somewhere, with my hand. So I'm--I'm sorry I got it too loud, and not meaning to.\n\nL-17 So let us stand now while we... if you can, if it's... Let's bow our head.\n\nL-18 Heavenly Father, we have assembled here this morning to worship Thee, and to give Thee thanks and praise, for sending Jesus our Redeemer, that we have a hope after this life is over, seeing that it's so uncertain that we live here all the time. And, Father, to see the wretched conditions these bodies can get into, we are glad we don't have to stay here all the time. Thou has made a way of escape, down through the valley of death.\n\nL-19 And, Father, we are grateful to You this morning, for the life of one who stood with us, less than a year ago, singing Your praises; Sister Florence Shakarian, as we knew her. And Thou has told us long before, even years, that this was going to happen, that it wouldn't be too much of a shock for us. And we know what You say is true. And then Your Word says, \"A man that is born of woman, is full of few days and full of troubles.\" We know that's true, too, Lord. We know we all must come down through that valley. So we thank You for her life that was, here on earth. And believing by faith, that now, this morning, she has passed from this miserable pesthouse, into a glorious body which can never be sick. And her talents of singing, and the voice she had, and her spirit so richly in-graced with Christ! That she could return this morning, she would not do it by no means; she would have to go through all this again. Which, now it's over, she is with her mother and her daddy. They called their baby, home. So, we--we thank You.\n\nL-20 We also want to pray for comfort, for our Brother Shakarian, our dear beloved brother, knowing the--the life that he has lived, and the torments he is going through in these last days, and how he is. Seeing him aging, and his hair slipping away, and his shoulders stooping, and yet trying to stay on the field for God. God, give him strength today. We pray, God, that You will grant it. To all those who are bereaved over her going, we pray for each one.\n\nL-21 And let us, Lord, as we are thinking of this, remember that we too must go someday. While we're sitting together here in the Presence of the Lord Jesus, we would ask that You would bring this fresh to our memory. And let us check up, as it was, or take inventory of our own lives, that we be under the Blood and in the Faith. Grant it, Lord.\n\nL-22 Now as I try under these circumstances to bring a little message to the people, today, I pray that You will help me, Lord. Strengthen me, for I--I--I need it, Lord. And I pray that You will grant it. And may something be said that would just honor You. And if there be any under the sound of our voice this morning, who is not ready to meet the hour that lays before them, may this be the time that when they'll surrender to Him Who said, \"I am the Way, the Life, the Truth,\" even our Lord Jesus Christ. For we ask it in His Name. Amen. (You may be seated.)\n\nL-23 [Someone on the platform speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] The brother here wants to know if everyone can hear all right. He's got two mikes on. Is that all right? Can you hear? Raise up your hands if you can. Can you hear; raise your hands. All right.\n\nL-24 I'm sorry that we do not have seating room for everyone this morning. And we trust that I won't stay up here too long, just enough to maybe bring us maybe a reading of the Word; that the Lord God will honor His Word that's being read, and will give us of His grace, that we might serve Him by it.\n\nL-25 Now I was told by Billy Paul, this morning, that it might be possible that we speaking next Sunday at the Grantway Assembly of God, in Tucson. If there is anyone here from Tucson, I might not get to see you this week. I'll be at the Grantway Assembly of God, next Sunday.\n\nL-26 So now we just come back from up in the East, and I kind of run myself down a little, by overeating, with overkindness of the people down in the mountains. And--and I got sick, so I haven't felt good this week. So, you pray 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min for me. And...\n\nL-27 [Someone says, \"Too much opossum.\"--Ed.] What you say? [\"Too much opossum.\"] Brother Carl Williams with his sense of humor, and I think we need it right now, he said, \"Too much opossum.\" I don't know about that, Brother Carl, but a whole lot of squirrels. [Brother Branham laughs.]\n\nL-28 So you want to pray for someone this morning, why, I--I certainly appreciate if it would be some of your prayer for me, because I--I need it. Now we want to go quickly into the Word.\n\nL-29 And I don't want to keep you here too long, because I believe there is a telephone hook-up across the nation, on this this morning, goes all the way from the West Coast to the East Coast, from North and South. Many, many assemblies have got this accomodation that you all had here from the tabernacle. It's also hooked up in Phoenix, that everywhere the services is, it comes right in to the... And they gather in churches and in homes, and things like that, do a very fine way. They say it's even better than a broadcast. It's the telephone hook-up, they put a receiver on a microphone, or whatever it is, in the room. And they... My wife said, coming from Indiana last week, down to Tucson, it was just the same as standing right in the room. So we pray that God will bless all those out on the line this morning, wherever they are. Up in New York now it will be, oh, in the afternoon, and different times as it crosses the nation.\n\nL-30 Now over in the Book of Romans, the 12th chapter, and the 1st and 2nd verses, we wish--wish to read this Scripture. I beseech you therefore, brethren., by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, and acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and perfect... good, acceptable, and perfectwill of God. [Romans 12:1-2]\n\nL-31 Now, if the Lord willing, I want to take my subject for this morning, on: God's Power To Transform. That you might not be conformed to this world: but be... transformed by the renewing of your mind, now, and prove that which is that good, perfect, and acceptable will of God. [Romans 12:1-2]\n\nL-32 It's an old familiar text that many of your pastors has used down through your time. It's been used since It was written. But yet, one thing about the Word of God, It never grows old, because It's God. It never grows old. Through every generation now, for pretty near, about twenty-eight hundred years, or better, this Word of God has been read by man, priests, and so forth, and never does It grow old. I've been reading It, myself, for some thirty-five years. And each time I read It, I find something new that I looked over the first time. Because, It is inspired, It is God in letter form. See, It's the attributes of God speaking fore, forth, and is placed on paper.\n\nL-33 Many times, man said, \"Well, now, man wrote this Bible.\" No. The Bible says, Itself, that God wrote the Bible. It is the Word of God.\n\nL-34 And It never can fail. Jesus said, \"Heavens and earth will fail, pass away, but My Words shall never fail.\" And It cannot fail, and being God, because It's part of Him. [Luke 21:33], [Luke 16:17]\n\nL-35 And then you being a son and daughter, you are part of It, and that makes you a part of Him. So that's why we come to fellowship together around the Word of God. [John 15:5-6]\n\nL-36 Now this word transformed, I looked up in the dictionary, yesterday. When, I almost lost track of the time that I was to be up here, when I was looking for a text, and I found this word, or this text, rather, Scripture. And in the dictionary it says that it's \"something that's changed.\" It's to be \"changed.\" Transformed, \"made different than what it was.\" It's been, \"Its character and everything has been changed in it,\" to transform.\n\nL-37 And I thinking this morning, in Genesis 1. This world was without form, and it was void, and darkness was upon the earth; nothing but a complete chaos. And when this world was in that condition, the Spirit of God moved upon the 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min face of the water, and the entire picture was changed; from a total chaos, to a garden of Eden. That is transforming Power of God, that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it. God's transforming Power! [Genesis 1:1-4]\n\nL-38 And we understand that, by reading the Scriptures, that God was six--six thousand years in making this preparation for this Eden. Now, He might not have been that long; but just presuming, and taking it from the Scripture where It said \"one day with God, is a thousand years on earth,\" that is, if God should count time. And say it was six thousand years He had in making the earth, and He had planted upon the earth all good seed. There was just everything was perfect. [Genesis 1:31], [Psalms 90:4]\n\nL-39 I think, many times, when even critics begin to read the Book of Genesis, they begin to criticize It, because it seems like It constantly repeats Itself, or throws you out here and there.\n\nL-40 But if we would just notice for a moment, before we get into our text, that, Moses saw the vision. And God spoke to him. God spoke to Moses face to face, lip to ear. Now, He never spoke to any other man like that, as He did Moses. Now, Moses was a great, one of the greatest of all the prophets. He was a type of Christ. And now God can speak, He has a voice. It's been heard. God can speak. [Exodus 33:11-23]\n\nL-41 And God can write. God wrote the ten Commandments with His Own finger. He wrote on the walls of--of Babylon once, with His finger. He stooped down and wrote in sand one time, with His finger. God can speak. God can read. God can write. [John 8:6]\n\nL-42 God is the Fountain of all grace and Power, and of all Divine wisdom, is in God. So therefore, knowing that, He is the only Creator there is. There is no other creator but God. Satan cannot create, at all, he only perverts what's been created. But God is the only Creator.\n\nL-43 Therefore, He created by His Word. He sent His Word. So all the seeds that He had placed upon the earth, He formed those seeds by His Own Word, for there was no nothing else to make the seed out of. He had placed them, and they were beneath the water. He just said, \"Let there be this, and let there be that.\"\n\nL-44 Now we find out that, many times, it look like the Bible repeating or saying something to what It doesn't, say. For instance, in Genesis 1 we find that, \"God created man in His Own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.\" And then He goes on, and many things happened upon the earth. [Genesis 1:27]\n\nL-45 Then we come to find out, there was no man to till the soil. \"Then God created man out of the dust of the earth.\" That was a different man. \"And He breathed the spirit of life into him, and he became a living soul.\"\n\nL-46 The first man was in the image of God, which is Spirit. John 4, says, \"God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in Spirit and in Truth.\" But God is a Spirit. And the first man, that He created, was spirit-man, and he was in the image and in the likeness of God. [John 4:24]\n\nL-47 And then He put this man in flesh, and man fell. So then God came down and become in the image of man, that He might redeem that fallen man. That's the real Gospel story, to my--to my opinion.\n\nL-48 Now, God, in six thousand years, had planted all these wonderful seeds, or He had spoke His Word. \"It shall be this way. This tree shall be. This shall be.\" Everything was perfect. It was just good. And He commanded each one of those seeds that they would be, they would transform themselves into the plant of which kind of life that the Word of God had spoken in them should be. If it was an oak tree, it was to bring forth an oak. If it was a palm, it was to bring forth a palm.\n\nL-49 Because, the great Creator had just sent forth His Word, and the Word seed was there before the real seed was ever formed. And the Word formed the seed. See, \"He made the world out of things that does not appear.\" See, He--He made the world by His Word. God spoke everything into existence.\n\nL-50 And being God, the Creator, speaking all things into existence, it must have been a perfect world. It was a--a beautiful place. It was a--a real genuine paradise here on the earth.\n\nL-51 Now, as, every place has to have a headquarters somewhere. This convention has a headquarters, and this chapter 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min has a headquarters, and a church has a headquarters. And God has a headquarters. And so this great place, nation that we live in, it's got a headquarters. And so this great Eden had a headquarters, and its headquarters was headed-up in the garden of Eden, or in Eden, east of in the garden.\n\nL-52 And God placed over this, to rule all His great creation here on earth, His Son and His Son's bride, Adam and Eve.\n\nL-53 God was the Father of Adam. \"Adam was the son of God,\" according to the Scriptures. He was the son of God.\n\nL-54 And God made him a helpmate, out of his own body; perhaps a rib from over his heart, so she would be close to him, and made him a helpmate. It really wasn't his wife as yet, no more than it was man as yet; He had just spoke it. And there is where the trouble come, Satan found her before Adam did. So, it was just His Word He had spoken. [Genesis 2:18]\n\nL-55 I say that, I don't want to spend too much time on it. But some of you might get a bit confused, especially some of the people up in the--out in the South, seem to find just a little confusing on the Message that I have from God today, to the people, that about the serpent's seed. And I'm going to go home, the Lord willing, one of these days, to Jeffersonville. I want about a six-hour message, and straighten that all out, see, so it'll put it just in form that you'll know what we're speaking of. And it's THUS SAITH THE LORD. It's just as true as it was when It seen our Sister Florence before she went away, several years. See, It's the Truth. And now, we, maybe it's misunderstood.\n\nL-56 If somebody would come to me, something contrary, I would kind of misunderstand it, myself. I wouldn't want to criticize what anyone says. We're not to criticize each other. I'm not guilty of doing that; I thank the Lord. I have criticized sin and unbelief; but no individual person, see, I--I don't. We are--we are brothers and sisters, striving, we are coming down to where Sister Florence came yesterday morning, see. She, we, we all got to come that way. And it's not my purpose to--to try to criticize a brother or sister that wouldn't agree with you. No, far be it from me to do that! I don't think you'll ever find a tape that I ever called anybody's name on. Which, I have felt that many times the person was wrong, but that's between them and God. But what is wrong, in the way of sin and... And misunderstandings sometimes is not even sin, it's just misunderstandings of people. And I--I think each one of us has a right to express ourself to our understanding.\n\nL-57 Now this great Creator had placed His created son. Now, Adam was His first created son. Jesus was His only begotten Son, see, He was begotten by a woman. But Adam was right straight from the hand of God, in the creation.\n\nL-58 Now the headquarters, with His--His son and His son's bride over all, it looked so perfect. There was a--a man, the head of all of it, His Own son and His bride.\n\nL-59 And every seed was perfect, the palms, and the oaks, and the grass, and the birds, and the animals. And everything was in perfect order with the Commandment of God, \"Don't change your nature. Bring forth of its kind, every seed! Oak, don't you never be perverted into a pawpaw tree.\" See? \"Palm, don't you be perverted into something else. But every seed after his kind!\" And He had--He had watched it through the times. [Genesis 1:11-12]\n\nL-60 And He had spoke the Word. And His great creating Power had formed these things that come up, and even the man and the woman. And they were the head because they were the... they were super to all the other races. And He put them also under a care of the same thing that He put trees, animals, and so forth: His Word. They must not never, by no means, break that Word. They must stay There. \"Don't never take anything from It, or add anything to It! You must live by this Word.\"\n\nL-61 And as long as that creation would have existed like that, Sister Shakarian wouldn't have had to have went this morning, as long as it would have stayed like that, God's great economy! It's what we believe that we are headed back to. We are going back to that spot, that place.\n\nL-62 Where? That seventh morning, when God looked upon it all, and He said, \"It's good. I--I am pleased with it. Yeah, I--I--I am glad I did it. And it's all now under control. And I have put trust in My son and in his wife, that--that they will; make them head of all of it, that they will watch over it all and see that it's all right, that everything will bring forth of its kind. Now he has the power to do that.\" God then said, \"Well, if it's all so good, and it can't be anything else, because it's My Own desire. It's the way I want it. And I have spoke it that way, and My Words has brought it just 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min exactly the way I wanted it. And there it is. It's all good!\" So the Bible said, \"God rested the seventh day, from all His works.\" [Genesis 2:2]\n\nL-63 And everything under control, to bring forth of its kind. Now remember, \"to bring.\" When He put the seed in the earth, the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it, to transform it from a seed to a plant, or whatever it was. His transforming power! Now, God put the seed in there, with potentials that it would be what He said it would be. And as long as it stayed in its right category, it would be just exactly what God said it would be. It had to be that way, because He had made it that way, and made a channel. That, anything that stays in His channel, in His line of Word, it will have to bring forth exactly like His Word said it would do. It cannot move from there. It's channeled just exactly right. So, with everything in the trust in His Own son, that it would be that way, then God said, \"It's all good, so I'll just rest. And each one of those seeds has power in itself, to transform itself into the specie that I desire it to be. That's what it must be, because I have given every seed transforming power, to make out of itself, in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be.\" [Genesis 1:21-25]\n\nL-64 God has never changed. Just the same today as He was then! God is determined to do something. He'll do it. Nothing is going to stop Him. He'll do it!\n\nL-65 Now after it's all so well and set in order, God felt sure now that this would all be all right, and then, when He did, then came in the enemy. I'm going to... God gave power to transform. And I'm going to call this fellow, with power not to--to create again, but I'm... He had power to deform, not transform; but to deform. Now, anything deformed is taken from its original state, there is something that's gone wrong with it.\n\nL-66 Some years ago, on patrol, going up through the corn fields. I would think of, there was a limb had blowed off of a tree, and had fell over on a stalk of corn. And the stalk was trying its best to get up straight like it was supposed to be, but it was deformed because that something had happened. And the stick was laying over it.\n\nL-67 Then we find a wild creeper in the field. Which, many of you man here, and maybe some of you women... if you come from Kentucky. The women uses the hoe there the same as a man, get out in the field with a--with a hoe, we call the old gooseneck hoe, and chop the--the creepers out. For, if you didn't get those creepers out, where the corn was in the row, like this, then the creeper would reach over, grab a hold of that corn, and wrap itself around gradually, so easy, so slyly, that you would hardly tell it was wrapping. And finally it gets stronger and stronger, and it pulls that corn till it's deformed. Pulls it against itself, wraps it around its own vine; deforming it from what it was, to something else. Yet it's corn, but it's deformed corn.\n\nL-68 And we are all still in the image of God. But some are so deformed, as sons of God, that walk contrary to His Word and to His way that--that He had us and provided for us to walk. Setting something, the world twists us out of the way, pull us close to it, and away from that straight, narrow strip that He planted us in, to be sons and daughters of God. Sin has done this evil thing to the sons and daughters of God. [Genesis 1:26-27]\n\nL-69 The deformer! I know this seems to be rather strange to speak of it in this way, \"to--to deform,\" but that's what he was; he deformed, or perverted. Pervert means \"to be changed over, made something different.\" And deform is the same thing, that it's been brought over and deformed, and \"made in another way.\" Yet it's still the same seed, but it's deformed.\n\nL-70 Now we find that this deformer has also had the same amount of time, to deform, as God had to transform. Now he planted his seed, or, never planted his seed, he... in the garden of Eden. Since that time, he has had six thousand years of deforming the Seed of God, the Word of God; to deform It, make It something different; when he... the first time that Eve listened to him, and got herself just one little phrase.\n\nL-71 Remember, first Satan quoted that Scripture just as clear as it could be, \"God has said that, 'Ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden of Eden'?\" See? \"You shall not eat of every tree?\"\n\nL-72 And remember now, Eve said, \"Yes, we may eat of every tree; but the tree that's in the midst of the garden, we mustn't even touch it.\" Now watch him, in his message, twist that Word just a little bit. In saying... Eve said, \"For God said, that, if we do this, that day we 'die.'\" [Genesis 3:2-3] 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min\n\nL-73 He said, \"Oh, surely you will not die.\" See, he was a--a man, he said, \"You, you do this now. And, you, you are kind of an ignorant people. You, really, you don't know all things. But if you would only partake of this, then you would have wisdom, you would have knowledge. You would know right from wrong and be like gods, you, if you would only partake of this wisdom that I have. I know, but you don't.\" [Genesis 3:4]\n\nL-74 Which, it's all right to have wisdom. But if the wisdom is contrary, if the wisdom isn't correct wisdom from God, Divine wisdom, and becomes natural wisdom; I don't care how much science we have, and whatmore, or education, it's of the Devil. I'll prove it to you, the Lord willing, in a few minutes. It's of the Devil.\n\nL-75 Civilization is of the Devil. I just got through preaching on that. All culture in the earth, all powers of science, and everything, is of the Devil. It's his gospel he preached, of knowledge, in the garden of Eden. And he has took that knowledge, perverted knowledge, contrary to the Word and will and plan of God. And now he has had six thousand years to do just exactly what God did, only in a perverted way, and took the same amount of time to bring his own Eden in. Now he has got an Eden here on earth, and it's filled with wisdom, knowledge. That was his gospel at the beginning, knowledge, wisdom, science. Never did God ever cater to such. And I--I want you to watch a minute. He did this, and because that he was a man of worldly wisdom. [Matthew 4:8-9]\n\nL-76 Now, it's hard to say this. It's--it's very hard, because speaking to people who feel the same way I do, and the way I have been for many years. But since the opening of those Seven Seals, of them Angels just behind the mountain yonder, This has become a new Book. It's the things that's been hid, is being revealed as God promised in Revelation 10, He would do it. And we are the privileged people that God has chosen, of the earth, that we might see and understand these things; which is not some mythical, fleshly mind of a person trying to make it up. It's the Word of God made manifest, proven, that It's right. Proven, not by science; but by God, that It's right. God, as I have said before in a message, God doesn't need anyone to interpret His Word. He is His Own interpreter. He says it'll happen, and it happens. That's, He--He confirms it, that interprets it. [Revelation 10:7]\n\nL-77 A few years ago when, we pentecostal people, when the--the other churches told us that we were \"crazy,\" we \"could not, the Holy Ghost was a thing past.\" But we find out that God's promise was to whosoever will, and now we know different. See, and that's just little by little, this thing has opened up.\n\nL-78 And now He promised that the mysteries that was hid in those, all those church ages, would be revealed right at the end time. And He lets us know now. We are at the end time. We're here now.\n\nL-79 Now, Satan is the author of civilization. He is the author of science. He is the author of education.You say, \"Is that true?\" [Genesis 4:16-17]\n\nL-80 All right, let us read in God's Word now, Genesis 4, and let's go back and just see for a minute. I know I may, if I get too long, Brother Carl will probably tell me. [Someone says, \"It's all right.\"--Ed.] But now Genesis, the 4th chapter, and the 16th verse, goes ahead telling here, in the beginning, what God did in order, to place the curse upon the man and the woman, and all that they was to do; and not the curse on them, but tell them what would happen, and curse the ground for Adam's sake. And we find out here now, that Eve had a pair of twins. And one of them was of Satan, and one of them was of God. Now you say, \"Oh, no! No. Now, Brother Branham!\"\n\nL-81 Just a minute. You find me one Scripture, anywhere, that says that Cain was Adam's son. I'll show you in the Scripture where It says, \"Cain was of that evil one,\" not Adam.\n\nL-82 Now notice when she conceived here. We begin at the 4th chapter, first. And Adam knew... his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten... she said now, I have gotten a son from the LORD.\n\nL-83 Course, it had to be. No matter if it was prostitute or anything, it had to come from God, see, because that's His seed, it's the law of His seed, it has to bring forth whether it's corrupted seed, perverted seed, or whatever it is. It's got to bring forth, anyhow. It's His command. 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min And she again bare his brother Abel.\n\nL-84 No more knew him. Adam knew his wife, and she bare Cain and also bare Abel, twins. Satan was with her that morning, Adam that afternoon. [Genesis 4:1-2]\n\nL-85 You see the big fuss in the paper here, I believe, in Tucson now, of that woman bringing forth a colored child and a white child, at the same time. She lived with her husband that morning, and the man that afternoon. And the man would take care, the white man said he'd take care of his own child, but the colored man would have to take care of his own. See? I know that, in breeding of dogs and so forth, it certainly will, if it's in a few hours afterwards. This proves it.\n\nL-86 Now to show where civilization come from, now let us read Genesis over here, in the 4th chapter of Genesis again, and see where. The 16th verse. And Cain went out from the presence of God, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east side of Eden. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after... his son, Enoch.\n\nL-87 Civilization started. Doctor Scofield, here in my Scofield Bible, it says, \"The first civilization.\" Notice, then he begot sons, and they made organs and music. The next one begot sons, and he begin to do other things, wonders, build cities, and--and make instruments of brass, and all kinds of things. See, that's what he did, become the first civilization, which was Cain-ite. He's done the same thing down through the ages.\n\nL-88 Now let's get there with the 25th verse, and watch what the next was. And Adam knew his wife again, now, and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, has appointed me another seed instead of Abel who Cain slew. And Seth... And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: and then began men to call upon the name of the LORD (out of the Seth side, not the Cainites' side). [Genesis 4:25-26]\n\nL-89 See, that great intellectual that we all so hold to! What's communism today, what is their god? It's the intellectual, science. What are we doing, anyhow? Where are we living? Consider these words today.\n\nL-90 Now he has his kind of an Eden, Satan does now. In these six thousand years, he has formed (not created), but deformed God's whole earth; his creatures, the animals, interbreeding, hybreeding; trees, plants, human; even to religion, the Bible, church; until he has got hisself a complete garden of Eden, of science, everything moving by science. Our automobiles, everything that we have, was given to us by science, what man has done. And he has got his great Eden here; to prove the Message is timely, to prove that it's not some other age but Revelation 10! Look at the hybreeding today, to make a better, or, prettier, not a better. Look at little children today.\n\nL-91 I had my daughter to a dentist, yesterday, and he said her teeth was twisting. A brother down in Tucson, Brother Norman, had his little daughter, and her teeth was bucking out. And the dentist says that soon, he believes, that maybe in times to come, that people will be born, teeth growing any way. It's the food that we're eating, hybrid food.\n\nL-92 Did you read Reader's Digest, last month, about Billy Graham, the noble evangelist? Have you been listening to him? I pray for him now more than ever. When he talked to those turned-around collars, and so forth, the other night, laying it onto that clergy. Something has happened to him. One of these days, I hope he sees his position where he's at, notice, now is calling from Sodom, that perverted city. And now notice this in Reader's Digest, Billy had gotten so weak that he couldn't even hold his meetings. And they told him he had to run, take exercise, and so forth. So he runs a mile each day, I believe it is, or something, to get exercise.\n\nL-93 Man is rotten. The whole human race is corrupted. Everything is like it was in the antediluvian time. It's completely upset, turned around, different from the straight row that God planted them in. Sin, through science and deception, has twisted the whole human race.\n\nL-94 Did you read also just below that article, where it said, \"In these days, that little girls and boys are in their middle age, according to physical structure, between twenty and twenty-five years old.\" Think of it.\n\nL-95 In discernment the other night, I picked up a girl twenty-two years old, in menopause, called her out. And that's 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min what her doctor had told her.\n\nL-96 See, it's a fallen, degenerate, hell-bound race of corruption. I know that sounds not ethical. But it's Biblical, see, that it is true; and this race that we're living in, this generation of people.\n\nL-97 Now notice today, hybreeding cattle, hybreeding plants; and science comes right back around, the same science that does it, says, \"That is what's destroying the whole human race.\" You read it the same as I do. Well, why don't they stop it? Is because that they can't stop it. God's Word has said it would be that way. But if they would think for a minute, they are the instruments, as Judas Iscariot, placing exactly the thing that God said would happen. It's doing it just exactly on their own basis of science.\n\nL-98 By his scientific research, in the same pattern he deceived Eve, he also has deceived the church, which there Eve was a type. Now, now Adam a type there again, or Eve, rather, of the church, notice what it did. Through the wandering for knowledge, she slips across the line between right and wrong, by listening to Satan's perversion, or deformity, of the original Word of God.\n\nL-99 And now the churches today has become deformed. Now I'm not talking about the peoples, the individuals. I'm talking about the church world. One is twisted one way, and one twisted another, and, by science. Same pattern that he did. He has carried out his threat, Satan has, of Isaiah 14:12.\n\nL-100 Let's just read that for a minute. In the Book of Isaiah, let's begin the 14th chapter, the 12th verse. How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cast down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! This is Isaiah seeing him in a vision, see, in the age to come. For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation,... the sides in the north: [Isaiah 14:12]\n\nL-101 Satan's purpose, from Eden, was to make his ownself an Eden; and exalt himself above, so the stars of God would worship him, sons would worship him. And he has absolutely carried it out now, and when he's done this and brought it into the church. Which, I won't go in details. Any of you listening to them tapes know about it. That, that's exactly the hour we're living in, and it's Satan that's done it through educational program, better fit, better this, better that. And not knowing, all the time, they're walking right straight into death. Blinded, leading the blind, blinded leaders of the nations, blinded leaders of science, blind leaders of the church, blind leading the blinded. Jesus said, \"Let them alone, they will both fall in the ditch.\" [Matthew 15:14]\n\nL-102 Here notice the type of the two Edens so closely typed together, till almost deceive the very Elected. Matthew 24:24 said that it would be that way. But I want us to stop for a few moments and consider these two Edens, and one thing especially, how the Bible tells us that God's Word did produce that Eden, and how God's Word warns us that the other Eden would come. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-103 Now, we also know that there has got to be another Eden, if we would also listen to the prophet, Paul, in II Thessalonians the 2nd chapter. I could read It if you want to. He who exalts himself; that day will not come, of the Lord, until that man of sin be revealed,... ... he who sits in the temple of God, exalting himself above all that is called God, so that he as God is worshipped as God. [II Thessalonians 2:3-4]\n\nL-104 Think of that! Now Isaiah 14, the prophet said that he saw \"Lucifer, in his heart,\" through a vision under inspiration of God, \"saying he would do that.\" In Isaiah, eight hundred years before Paul, or approximately then. [Isaiah 14:12-16]\n\nL-105 Now here, eight hundred years later, Paul sees him, comes to his position. Notice, it heads up, his Eden; his scientific Eden, with his scientific world, with a scientific bride-church, all under the--the word of \"knowledge,\" great seminaries, great degrees, educational programs.\n\nL-106 Listen, brother, sister, each one of us is going to walk that road that Florence walked. I ask you, in Jesus' Name, to consider This. Not consider me. I'm your brother. That, that isn't it. Consider the Word that I am speaking, of God's 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min Bible. And look through, perfectly vindicated in God's Own Word, in the age we're living in, where we're at.\n\nL-107 These programs are absolutely antichrist, in themselves. Now, he has got to have an Eden, he said he would do it. Here is the simple Word of God saying he would do it, and here we look right out and seeing him do it. He has done it with his intellectual, scientific, denominational bride. He is going to take head, one of these days, in a World Council of Churches that will be set up. All will be with him. Trying... [II Thessalonians 2:3-4]\n\nL-108 The people, not because they're bad people; they were planted in that straight row, like corn, but Satan sowed the creepers, called science, research, education, doctors' degrees. Sometime they won't even let you in the pulpit unless you can produce a doctor's degree from some seminary somewhere. It's all wrong! Not the people; it's the program that's wrong. And now what's it done? It's all headed up again, and brought the whole entire world (through a bunch of hybriding, perversion of the original Seed of God) to another darkened chaos.\n\nL-109 But I'm so glad that God is mindful of us again, that He can still move upon the face of the condition. He promised He would do it, and call a little flock which would be His Bride.\n\nL-110 Notice here again now, how perfect these churches type, or these Edens.\n\nL-111 God, through a Seed of His Word! And there is only one thing that can quicken the Word, and that is the Spirit, for It is the Life-Giver to the Word. And when the Life in the Word meets the Life of the Spirit, It produces whatever the Seed is.\n\nL-112 Now notice what's happened. In the garden of Eden was God's economy of innocence, and that was one of the--the dispensations. The first dispensation was innocent, the people knowed no sin. They didn't know anything about sin. Both Adam and Eve were naked, but they were hid from their nakedness, by a spirit veil over their face. They never knew that they were naked, at all, because they were hid. For, God's veil in their own minds, they didn't know what right and wrong was. And them both standing there naked, showed that the knowledge had not yet come to them, see, that they were naked. The pair was naked and knew it not. [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-113 Now if you'll turn, if you wish to, or write it down, to Revelation, the 3rd chapter. The Holy Spirit predicting this last age, to the Laodicea Pentecostal Church Age in the last days, He said: ... thou art naked, and blind, and know it not. [Genesis 2:25], [Revelation 3:14-21]\n\nL-114 There is God's Seed, under innocence, not knowing at all they were naked, under a veil of the Holy Spirit, veiling them from sin.\n\nL-115 And now in the last church age, we find here that they're naked again, and don't know it. But it's not the Holy Spirit veil. It's the veil that Satan slipped over Eve back there, a veil of lust, the lust veil. They are so filthy till they don't know that they are naked, our women on the street, with shorts on, sexy dress. [Revelation 3:14-21]\n\nL-116 Someone sent me a piece in the paper the other day, of this new dress that they're going to wear, I think, fourteen inches from the hips, or something. And I wonder if our--if our women folks does realize that that is a lust veil? [Matthew 5:28]\n\nL-117 Now you--you would say, \"I can prove, before God, that I am innocent of any adultery to my husband, or I--I... all this.\" But still, at the Judgment, you're going to be called an \"adulteress.\" The Bible said so. Jesus said, \"Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\" [Matthew 5:28]\n\nL-118 \"Blind, naked, and don't know it!\" Not them poor little women out there; there is nothing I got against them. It's that evil! And the system of the church seems to fail to recognize it or stand against it; let them bob off their hair, wear make-up, and shorts and things, under the name of Christianity. What a horrible thing it is! See, they are naked again, in Satan's Eden, and knows it not. They don't know it. [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-119 I believe I see, perhaps, looking across here, the swimming pool, that women out there now. If that woman only realized that what she is doing, but she doesn't know it. She is naked. Her body is sacred. She strips off the clothes that God clothed her with, with skin, for this generation. She constantly cuts it off. She is naked, under the word of 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min \"civilization, higher education, better civilization, higher ethics.\" Let me be sure that this soaks in. It's all of the Devil, and will be destroyed at the Coming of the Lord Jesus. It'll be destroyed, every bit of it. There won't be one thing left.\n\nL-120 And, oh, friend, across the nation, as you are listening to me here in Phoenix, think of those things! You are here subject to them. Now, Jesus said that they would deceive the Elected if possible.\n\nL-121 The first spirit was a... first veil was a holy veil, Holy Spirit, and she wasn't supposed to look out of That. But when--when Satan begin to talk to her about knowledge, she just had to take a little peep at the world.\n\nL-122 And that's exactly what her daughter, the church, has done. You have to see, you have to dress like some movie star, or young men have to act like Elvis Presley or--or Pat Boone, or--or some of those people, under the name of religion.\n\nL-123 Pat Boone is a Church of Christ. Elvis Presley is a Pentecostal. Two demonized characters that's throwed the world in a worse chaos than Judas Iscariot did at the betraying of Jesus Christ. They don't know it. Them boys don't know that. Nothing that I have against those--those boys, man, it's the spirit that's motivating it.\n\nL-124 Just step over on that side one bit, let that creeper just get one little hold around the shuck of that corn, one time, watch what takes place; the corn is gone. Oh, yeah, it's done got him. And that's the way it'll do it. It'll do it every time. Eve had to take just one peep at the world.\n\nL-125 And let me say something to you, brother and sister. In First John, the 2nd chapter and the 15th verse, we can read It if you wish to, the Bible says: ... If we love the world, or the things of the world, it's because the love of God is not even in us. [I John 2:15]\n\nL-126 Now, the word there is not earth; it's a Greek word, is kosmos, which means \"the world's order.\" If we love fashions of the earth, the world, if we love the trend of the day, if we think \"this is a wonderful time, oh, we have all these things,\" if you think that, it's because your thinking is wrong. It is perverted by the Devil. \"For if you love the world's order, and the things of this present world, it's because the love of God is not even in you.\" Remember that. O God! Look what we're looking into! [I John 2:15-16]\n\nL-127 Here I want to stop just a minute and tell you a little story. I heard a chaplain from the First World War. They had throwed...\n\nL-128 Like Satan at the beginning, when he come into the garden of Eden. He could not dig up those Seeds. He could not destroy them. But he sprayed them with poison, and it deformed the Seed, it didn't bring forth its right kind. It deformed the original Seed.\n\nL-129 And that's what all these programs of religion. They are still sons and daughters of God, but it's being deformed. They go to church, wanting to do right. A nun never enters a nunnery to be a mean woman. A minister never goes through school just to be a--a--a bad man. You never join church, and shake hands, put your name on the book, or whatever you do in your church, to be a bad person. You do that to be a good person. But it's the deception, it's the deformity that does it. Satan sprayed it. See? God never had an organization. There is no such a thing anywhere found in the Words of God.\n\nL-130 God is our organization, we are organized in Him, a Body, in God, in Heaven. That's right. Our names are on the Lamb's Book of Life. See? Notice.\n\nL-131 But, see, I know it's very hard, but I--I want you to suffer just a little longer if you will. In the time of the world's war... Excuse me for getting away from my subject.\n\nL-132 But to make this point, I--I wanted to give you my analysis of what Satan done in Eden: sprayed horrible poison spray. Would you like to know what that spray was? I can tell you. I got the formula of it, two words: unbelief, which is contrary to faith, sprayed unbelief, doubt. And science filled its place. Where the cavity is, that went into the Seed, Satan filled that cavity with knowledge and science and civilization, and it's deformed the whole, entire creation of God.\n\nL-133 I know you think I'm getting you on a limb, but I'm on the limb with you. And we're all here to try to find what we can do. We don't say those things to be different. We must be honest. 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min\n\nL-134 We, each one, come down to the end of the road, where we're going to give account for every word. Right now, we know that our voices... When we are born, our first little cry goes all on a tape. It's going to be played back again at the Day of Judgment. Even the clothes you wear will be showed in your face, at the Day of Judgment. Even science has found that, by television. See, television doesn't manufacture a picture, it only channels it. The color of clothes, every time you move, every thoughts in your mind, is absolutely kept on God's record. And that big thing will be laid right before you, every one of them filthy dresses you wore; every time you went to the barber shop, cut that hair that God give you. It's going to be. You'll answer for it. You can't make a move right there, just even the thoughts of your heart while you're doing it, will be played right before you. How you going to escape? \"How shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?\" See? We're not going to escape. Every move, and the thoughts of the heart, is recorded right in another dimension, even the color of clothes you wear. Television, colored television proves it right out, pulls it out and shows it, see, and that's just in one dimension from the three that we live in. See? [Hebrews 2:3]\n\nL-135 Now how the poison has struck the church, struck the earth! Satan's poison upon the Seeds, has put cavities in it and caused it to be deformed. More and more, he sinks deeper into the hearts of the churches, and in the hearts of the people and everything, science, science. Until it's become a place where the human race, by being interbred... I believe every seed should bring forth of its kind. And the human race, and the plant, and all being interbred, has brought us to a place; in eating our food from the earth, which, our bodies, has made hybrid, it's put our whole minds... Now, if our bodies are falling, from twenty to twenty-five years old, because of degenerated cells, by hybrid foods, don't our brain cells degenerate? Isn't that cells, also? That's why Ricky runs through the street here, with this hot rod; while Ricketta, Elvitta's, and many of them, as we would call name, out here half naked before the people, mentally gone, no more conceptions of decency or morals.\n\nL-136 To my little story. This chaplain said he had been down in the hospital, and said so many boys laying in the tent, some... He had just come from the outside. He said he went out there, and some officer told him, said, \"Chaplain, we want to ride out, to take a look at the fields out there.\" They had throwed this mustard and clorine gas, as they did in them days.\n\nL-137 And said, \"I got out there, Brother Branham,\" said, \"there wasn't a bark on a tree, there wasn't a sprig of grass. It was on an Easter morning.\" He said, \"There was some old wrecked tanks down there, the officer had to get record of them, and see if there was anything could be done for them, near the great Argonne Forest. Said, \"When I was standing there by myself,\" said, \"I looked up, said, 'O God, this is the way it's all coming to.'\" That's right, it's all coming. It was all burnt up, no life nowhere at all, grass burnt off; the tree, by that gases, trees killed, everything was killed, twisted, hanging down, where bullets and things riddled it.\n\nL-138 If that isn't a picture of the world today, where Satan is spraying his unbelief, his hybreeding, his science, his knowledge! Until, what it was at the beginning, when God put Adam and Eve in the garden, that beautiful paradise without death, without sickness, without sorrow, and everything perfect in order, look what Satan's DDT has done! She is a chaos. There is nothing left in it.\n\nL-139 He said, \"I started crying. I walked back, I was attracted to a rock.\" Said, \"I just went over there and looked at the rock, pushed it over. Down beneath the rock was a little white flower growing, the only living thing left, because it had been sheltered by a rock.\"\n\nL-140 God, my Rock, shelter us today, O God, when these poisons are flying everywhere in the name of science and education. Shelter us. Keep me until that day, O God, is my prayer. [Someone on the platform says, \"Don't put any time limit, Brother Branham.\"--Ed.] Now I hope that we, each one, are under that Rock, Christ.\n\nL-141 I just preached the other day, many of you heard it. I was going down through the woods, hunting, and I was attracted to turn around. And I looked, and there laid an empty cigarette carton or package, or what you call it. And it's the company, I don't feel I should call their name, but the tobacco company had, they have a slogan, \"A thinking man's filter, a smoking man's taste.\"\n\nL-142 I started walking on down a--a little further in the woods, and Something attracted me, \"Go back to that cigarette 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min pack.\"\n\nL-143 I thought, \"Heavenly Father, I'm going down here to that tree where those squirrels was spoke into existence by You, one morning. Why would You call me back?\"\n\nL-144 And Something said, \"You've got a sermon coming for Sunday. Your text is wrote on it.\" I thought, \"On a cigarette pack?\" I went back.\n\nL-145 And I begin to think, \"A thinking man's filter,\" what a deception that is! If a man was a thinking man, he wouldn't smoke at all. But, you see, people swallow that.\n\nL-146 I believe it was two years ago, when I was in one of the conventions, I went up to the world's fair when it was on the West Coast. And they had Yul Brynner's picture and many of them there. And the scientists, many of them, was in the same hall, about the danger of smoking. How they pull that smoke across a marble, and took a little Q-tip and took up the nicotine off there and put it on a rat's back, and put him in a cage, in seven days he was so full of cancer he couldn't even walk. See? He said... Pulled it through water. Said, \"Filter!\"\n\nL-147 Said, \"Filter? There is no such a thing.\" Said, \"You... Now, this is science themselves. They said, \"You cannot have smoke unless you got tar. Tar makes the smoke.\"\n\nL-148 And the only thing it is, is a gimmick, to sell more cigarettes. When that, if I... Don't hope you think I'm sacrilegious or a fanatic. That devil in a man, that makes him smoke, to kill himself. When he--he wants the nicotine of one cigarette, that will supply his desire, now the company comes around with this deceiving gimmick, and says, \"A thinking man's filter.\" He'll have to smoke four or five cigarettes, to make as much tar in you (to satisfy him) as you did with the one. Americans selling death to their brethren and sisters! I don't get it.\n\nL-149 But yet in there, I thought, \"There is a thinking man's Filter that's right.\"\n\nL-150 Now if a man was smoking, remember, it produces a smoking man's taste. Then, if you cannot have the... fill the desire of a smoke until you get the smoke there and get... has to produce the taste. So you smoke four cigarettes, or five, and pay more for it than you would if you just smoked one regular cigarette. See, it's a gimmick, a sales gimmick; deceiving the people, Americans. When I think of Valley Forge, George Washington; with two-thirds of his soldiers, and no shoes on their feet, on that cold day, to make us the economy that we are! And then Americans sell American, his brother and sister, death, under a false gimmick, for filthy lucre, the root of all evil. The crave of money, love. The whole thing has gone mad, knowing not that this whole thing will perish! But if you don't get no smoke, you can't have the taste.\n\nL-151 Then I thought, \"There is a thinking man's Filter.\" A thinking man's Filter! And I took my text from \"A thinking man's Filter produces a holy man's taste.\"\n\nL-152 So I thought that our denominations has done a whole lot like that, take people in and call themselves Christians that's just any way. Why? They get more in their denomination or organizations. We get more in there because we let them come in under this, that, and the other, and anything. \"That don't make any difference, just so they put their name on the book and say they're a Christian. That's all. Oh, 'by faith you're saved.' You have to believe.\" The Devil does the same thing. Yeah.\n\nL-153 You got to be borned again, and that comes through God's Filter! Now there is a thinking man's Filter. I'm holding It in my hand. It won't produce a denominational taste, but It will certainly satisfy a holy man's taste, you know. [John 3:3]\n\nL-154 How could a bobbed-haired woman ever come through this Filter? How could a woman with shorts on ever come through It, or slacks, when the Bible says, \"It's an abomination to God, for a woman to put on a garment that even pertains to a man\"? And how can a man that thinks anything of himself, get out here and dress like the women, let his hair grow out like a woman, down in his eyes, with bangs, and twirled up like that? He is wearing his wife's underneath clothes. She is wearing his outer clothes. A thinking man's filter? A thinking man won't do that, or a thinking woman 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min won't do it. God's Word won't let it pass through. [Deuteronomy 22:5]\n\nL-155 There isn't one thing could pass through that Word. That's the Holy Spirit, and It brings the Word into you, and It produces a holy man's taste.\n\nL-156 Look at today, Ricketta on the street, lovely, beautiful anatomy God gave to her, and Satan using it. And she'll dress so immorally, not knowing that a week from today she may be rottening in the grave.\n\nL-157 Coming down the street here not long ago. I was preaching at a convention in an Assemblies of God over on the West Coast, in a meeting out to the Southwestern Bible School. A little lady walking down the road, a little... them little clothes on, bikini's, ever what you call it, and fringe hanging out, with a cowboy hat and boots. I was going up the road. I thought, \"Poor little fellow, some mother and dad's child, was put here to be a daughter of God, and has become a bait trap of the Devil.\" I thought, \"I believe I'll just turn around and go back, and tell that kid.\" She looked to be about the age of my Sarah there, seventeen years, sixteen years old, or something. I thought, \"No, I better not. I'll just go up here on the road and pray for her. If somebody seen me stop and talk to her, I better not do it.\"\n\nL-158 Now, and listen, sons of God, you get in that same place, these Jezebels of the day play up to you, but a thinking man will think first. She may be so pretty, it may be \"I could make a hit with her,\" but it'll cost you your soul, boy; some of you girls, to these Rickies! Thinking man's Filter produces a holy man's taste.\n\nL-159 You married man, when you see them women on the street like that, you sons of God, don't you realize what taken place in the first beginning? When science had made women so pretty in the antediluvian world, until the sons of God took daughters of man (not daughters of God), and God never did forget it. They destroyed the whole thing; science, prettier. It used to be... You notice the beauty of women lifting in the last days, is a sign of the end; God has proved it. So, use a thinking man's Filter, you'll have a holy man's taste. It'll cost you your home. It'll cost you your position. It'll cost you everything you got; besides that, your soul! It'll break up your home. It may have another man raise your children, or another woman raise your children.\n\nL-160 Take a thinking man's Filter, it'll produce a holy woman's taste. When you start to the barber shop, or something another, and they tell you, \"You're going to have a headache, you know.\" Take a thinking woman's Filter, what the Bible said, see, then turn away from it. See? Don't you do it.\n\nL-161 I'm your brother, and I love you. Nothing I have against you. God knows. And that's what makes me say the things I do, is because of--of love of God for you. If a man would go out there and they won't tell you, your pastor let you sit around and act like that, he don't love you. He can't love you. I wouldn't want that kind of love for the women. I want to have a holy taste for my sister. I want her really be my sister. Not somebody can say, somebody talk about her being so pretty and how she is, and those sex queens, \"She goes to my... Huh-uh. No. I want her a lady!\n\nL-162 O Lord, keep me under the Rock. Yes. In Ephesians 5:26, the only one way you can get through that Rock, that's, \"Washed by the waters of separation by the Word.\" That's right.\n\nL-163 Now, don't let this Devil spray you with his education. No, no. It'll kill the influence of you. Don't let the Devil take that, \"Well, I belong to the church that my mother belonged to, that my father, my grandmother.\" Don't let the Devil spray you with that. The Bible has already said, on the Seven Church Ages, and things there, it's all gone to seed! That's right. The whole thing is corrupt. The whole thing is a putrified sore. Don't let him spray you, say, \"Well, it's higher ethics. We are more educated than we used to be in old days.\" Don't you let the Devil put that over on you. I've showed you his whole program of civilization, education and science. He's got it right into the church, and don't you listen to that. Keep your head out of them old dirty televisions and things!\n\nL-164 And our text says, \"Be not conformed, but be ye transformed.\" Not go in and say, \"I was confirmed, Sunday.\" No. Go in and be transformed right now, transformed from what you are, to what God wants you to be. [Romans 12:2]\n\nL-165 Now, it depends on what kind of seed that's in you. If an intellectual, educational seed has been placed in you, there is only one thing it can do, deform you, that's all, to a son or daughter of God. It's the only thing it can do. People today, as I look out, they act like they don't even believe there is a God. 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min\n\nL-166 Pardon this expression. If anybody's feelings is hurt by this, I don't mean it. A couple of Sunday's ago I was invited, by my own daughter, to come in to a television set and to watch a religious singing. It's at Sunday morning. I wanted to hear Oral Roberts on his program, I told them to let me know. Said, \"You hear this, this is a great hymn sing.\" My son standing there, told me about it, too. And I turned that set...\n\nL-167 We rent from a woman that has the television in her house. I never intend to have one in my house. No, sir. I don't want that thing in my house. I would blow it out with my shotgun. I don't want nothing to do with that evil thing. No, sir! But took a...\n\nL-168 Let me tell you about you Arizonians here. You seen that analysis the other day, of schools, didn't you? Eighty percent of the children in Arizona schools are suffering with mental deficiency, sixty-seven percent of them was by looking at television. How about that?\n\nL-169 You had better use your shotgun! See? Now, don't let the Devil spray you with that. No, sir. Now people, as I said, people act like they don't have to come to Judgment.\n\nL-170 These boys and girls, they had some Indian family, and a whole lot of stuff. I think a fellow named Mr. Pool is the head of it. And if I ever seen a modern mockery of hymns, it was the way they handled it; a bunch of Rickies standing there, shaking their hands up-and-down.\n\nL-171 I certainly appreciated that young man here this morning, that sang, looked decent, like a real man. I--I like that. When you--you businessmen sometime here get a bunch of these Rickies that stand here, and hoop and holler, and carry on, and hold their breath till they're blue in the face; and that's not singing, that's just making a lot of scientific noise. Singing is \"melody from the heart.\"\n\nL-172 And I thought, \"What a pity! What a shame it is! So how under the name of religion, they act like there is no God! Someone said, the other day, to a boy that goes with my daughter. A Christian boy said, give it a smart remark about Adam and Eve, said, \"Eve going through the garden. Said, 'Children, you see that tree there?' Said, 'That's where your mother eat us out of house and home.'\" Could you imagine, supposed to be a staunch Christian, that would take a promise and a Word of God and throw it off to a hog pen! They act like they don't have to come to Judgment. But God will bring every secret into Judgment. They act like there is no God. [Psalms 14:1]\n\nL-173 I don't want to call them a fool, because the Bible said... the fool, not right. Jesus said it isn't. \"Don't call no man a fool.\" But in Psalms 14: 1, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" See? They, they're not. I don't want to call them fools, but they act like they are. They act like it. [Psalms 14:1]\n\nL-174 So, you see where we're at today, like there is no God. \"I belong to church! And all the whole thing, the Bible, is a big joke. Our church knows where they're going!\" Yeah, right straight to hell. And exactly right on their road, right down through science and education, theological seminaries and things, just breezing them right down the road. The Holy Spirit doesn't have a chance to give a revelation on nothing; the seminary has done got it cut out.\n\nL-175 The Holy Spirit is to lead us; not a seminary, not bishops and overseers, and so forth. The Holy Ghost is our Leader.\n\nL-176 Cain was such a person as that. He was very religious in deed. Now, if religion is all that you have to have, then God was unjust by condemning Cain. Because, he was religious, he was just as religious and sincere as Abel was. Now remember, he thought of God, he worshiped God, he had a church, he built an altar, he made a sacrifice, he prayed, he worshiped, but he was rejected. No matter how... Esau was, also. See? [Hebrews 11:4], [Genesis 4:3-6]\n\nL-177 Religion, see, that is Satan's business; not to kill the whole thing, but just contaminate it. That's all. He ain't going to kill the whole thing. Oh, not communists; no, no, the antichrist is not communism. The Bible said, \"It would deceive the Elected if it was possible.\" Don't notice the iron curtain, but the purple one. Uh-huh. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-178 But, notice, Cain come to worship, but he had the wrong seed in him, serpent's seed. The hiss of the serpent had hissed over him, for he was the seed of the woman. He knew the perfect will of God, but he refused to do it. Did you know that? Satan knows the will of God, but just refuses to do it. 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min\n\nL-179 Notice, he had seen God vindicate Abel's message. Now I want you to think, use your thinking man's Filter now for a minute. Abel's correct message, that God vindicated to be the Truth! Are you drawing now? Uh-huh. Abel's message had been received, and Cain saw it and knowed that God had vindicated that message right. But he just couldn't do it. His pride kept him from it. That's right, his pride kept him from doing it. He seen God vindicate the message. [Genesis 4:3-6]\n\nL-180 So it seems to be now, so hard for people to humble themselves to the Word of God. They, they just don't want to do it. They'll humble themselves to the creed of the church, sure, but not to the Word of God.\n\nL-181 If you want to find this, you go to... I got a Scriptures here, that's what I'm referring to here. Genesis 4:6 and 7, God said to Cain, said, \"Why are your countenance fallen? Why are you all full of temper, walking around? You just heard a message that upset you.\" Said, \"Well, what are you doing that for? Why are your countenances fell, because I didn't come into your church? So why did you do it?\" Are you using a thinking man's Filter? See? [Genesis 4:3-7]\n\nL-182 Or, \"Why didn't... Why you looking like that?\" Said, \"If you'll do well, go do like your brother is doing out there, I'll receive you and bless you. I'll do for you the same thing.\" But he just couldn't do it. He said, \"Now, if you don't, sin of unbelief lieth at the door.\" [Genesis 4:6-7]\n\nL-183 Now when they tell us, \"The days of miracles has passed.\" And they see it so perfectly vindicated and proved, you see, all these things that God promised He would do in the last days, of Revelation 10 and Malachi 4, all those things so perfectly vindicated. What's the matter, brethren? What's wrong, see?\n\nL-184 If they don't; unbelief, which is sin. There is only one sin, that's, unbelief. That's right. You're not condemned because you drink, smoke, chew, wear shorts, do whatever you do. No, that don't condemn you. It's because you don't believe. If you believed, you won't do that. See? A believer doesn't do that. He takes a thinking man's Filter, see, see, or a thinking woman's Filter, either one. All right. But, you see, sin lieth at the door.\n\nL-185 Now notice what that done to Cain, and it's going to be the same today. It made Cain go away, a willful sinner. He willfully was disobedient. Every person will be the same way. Willfully disobedient after he had seen Abel's message so vindicated of God, that it was the truth, and refused to do it. Done the same then. Then he crossed the dividing line.\n\nL-186 There is a line you can cross. You know that, don't you? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now, ministers, both here and out in the--the telephone land where this broadcast is coming across the nation, do you realize that? When you see it is Scripture, and you won't do it, God won't always... He'll... Oh, you'll go on, be blessed. So was every one of Israel, they lived right in the wilderness, and raised children, crops, and blessed, and everything, but \"every one of them Eternally separated from God.\" Jesus said so. Oh, yes, God will bless you right on, but you're gone. Certainly. That's what the Bible says now, that's what He said. Notice, you can cross the separating line. Do you believe that? [\"Amen.\"] Cain did it.\n\nL-187 Let--let's just turn over here a minute, I got Hebrews 10:26. Let's see if I can find that right quick. The Book of Hebrews, the 10th chapter and the... I believe, the 26th verse. I got it wrote out here. Just a minute, if you'll bear with me, and let's just read It a minute. All right, here we are. For if we sin wilfully after that we... received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin, But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and the fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversary. [Hebrews 10:26-27]\n\nL-188 That's THUS SAITH GOD'S HOLY WORD. If we disbelieve willfully after we have seen It and heard It, then we're across the line. There will never be no more forgiveness for it, you have crossed the line. \"Oh,\" you say, \"God still blesses me.\" Oh, yeah.\n\nL-189 Remember Israel, the border lines. When God gave them a promise, over in the Holy Land; in the land, it was good, of milk and honey. And when Moses sent out Caleb and Joshua, and the spies, to go over and spy out the land, and brought back the vindicated evidence. [Numbers 13:23] 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min\n\nL-190 The ten of them said, \"We cannot do it. We're unable. Look at the difficult there. We'll be fanatics. We got these little bitty things to fight with. Look what they got. We, we can't do it. We're not able to do it.\" [Numbers 13:30]\n\nL-191 Joshua and Caleb said, \"We are more than able to do it! God made the promise.\"\n\nL-192 And, remember, they turned back. That was at Kadesh-barnea. And they turned back and become wanderers in the wilderness. And every one of them died, and is lost Eternally. Jesus said so. [Numbers 26:65]\n\nL-193 Don't cross that separating line, see. \"When you know to do good, and doeth it not, to you it's sin.\"\n\nL-194 Israel did the same. After they seen Moses vindicated, and then let Balaam spray them, that precious vindicated Seed. Pastor, don't you (never) say nothing against this Word. Look at Balaam, he was a prophet, and he seen the Seed of God, vindicated. But under his own great denomination that he lived in, Moab seen that bunch of wanderers coming through the land, he sprayed it, and said, \"Well, wait a minute. We're all Christians. We're all believers. Why, our fathers and your fathers are the same. Aren't we Lot's children? Wasn't Lot, Abraham's nephew? Aren't we all the same? Let's marry one another.\" And Israel, as Eve in the garden of Eden, let Satan spray her, he also sprayed Israel through a false prophet. When, the real prophet was with them, with vindicated Word. But by an intellectual knowledge conception, he sprayed them. Think of it now, it was never forgiven, the sin was never forgiven.\n\nL-195 The seeds rotted right in the path of duty, on the road to the promised land. Every one of them perished and rotted, right straight at church, in the line of duty, following God. And let Satan spray that intellectual spray over them, educational, intellectual conception, saying, \"Why, we are all the same, we're all children of God.\" You're not! But he let that false teacher there spray them with that intellectual conception that he had of It.\n\nL-196 And just like the Ecumenical Council is doing right now, see, same thing, \"Why, we'll all join together in one great organization.\" You're whole organizational system is of the Devil. It's the mark of the beast, in the Bible. I'll have the book on it, pretty soon, the Lord willing.\n\nL-197 Notice, in Noah's time, seeing the Word being erected, to float. Now let make a little remark here, the Word being put together for to be transformed from the ground to the skies. Seeing the structure of the thing; but with their intellectual conceptions, laughed in the face of the prophet, Noah, when he was prophesying of the end time. But what did... That structure was made of the Word of God, pitched inside and out, with prayer and faith. When the rains come, all the intellectual conceptions of religions died and rotted right in the... right in their churches, right upon the earth. And the ark floated above it all. The scientific sprayed seed rotted right in judgment. [Genesis 6:8-18]\n\nL-198 What are we trying to do, anyhow, are we trying to establish our church or are we trying to establish the Word of God? What are we trying to do? Where we working at? Are we trying to get the people back into This? What's this great Eve trying to do here in this last days, this church Eden?\n\nL-199 I'm going to have to quit right away, brother, 'cause it's--it's getting too late. [A brother says, \"Go on!\"--Ed.] Just give me just about fifteen more minutes, and I'll stop on my--my Scriptures here. [\"Certainly, go ahead.\"] Yeah. All right. I know. Well, the people probably wants to get in here and clean this up. But I just seem like it's hard for me to quit. [\"Just go ahead.\" \"Well, there ain't no hurry.\"] I'll hurry. All right.\n\nL-200 Look, the great scientific, educational, hybrid Eve today, called the church, what is she trying to do? Is she trying to exalt God's Word, and let the people do the way they're doing? They're not using a thinking man's Filter, or, God's Filter. Look what they're producing. They're exalting themselves. The church is, in her deformed seed of knowledge program, has caused the whole race to be scientifically ignorant of the Word of God. Now I'll catch those remarks, I'm not going to hold on them too long now, to get finished. Scientifically ignorant! When God, right here on the earth, doing the things that He is doing, by His promised Word, and they ignore It and walk away because they are scientifically ignorant. Scientifically ignorant!\n\nL-201 I was smiling then because of Brother Williams here, wrote over here on a piece of paper, \"You can stay at it all afternoon,\" something. But, I appreciate that, that's really fine.\n\nL-202 But the people are--are willfully sinning. It's brought the--the whole system of church world today into a willful 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min sin against God. Why, common decency will prove to you that It's right. All right. A lust veil blinded their eyes, to the Word of God, and she finds herself naked again. You know, God, in Revelation 3, said, \"Come, buy some eye salve from Me, that your eyes might be opened.\" See, the eye salve is His Word. [Revelation 3:18]\n\nL-203 You know, they say, \"Well, this man studied forty years, to get his degrees. He is a BLD, DD, and all this.\"\n\nL-204 You know what Jesus said about that? He said, \"Let a man deny himself.\" Paul did. You say, \"That don't mean that.\" [Matthew 16:24]\n\nL-205 Well, why did Paul follow it up for, then? He said, \"I never come to you with enticing words of man's wisdom, because you would build your hopes upon that. But I come to you in power and manifestations of the Holy Ghost, that your word would be... your faith would be built on the Word of God, not the manifestations of a wisdom.\"\n\nL-206 It seems that people has lost their common decency and modesty. They're not like they used to be. It used to be, when the prophet said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD,\" the people trembled. Yeah, they certainly did. The people moved, for they was afraid. But now they lost all their scare of It. They don't fear God.\n\nL-207 Solomon said, \"The--the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom,\" just the beginning of it. [Proverbs 9:10]\n\nL-208 But the prophet can speak THUS SAITH THE LORD; the people say \"nonsense!\" See, there is not a hope for them. It's, they say, \"Why, we are smart. We're intellectual, we don't have to take that kind of stuff! We know what we're talking about!\"\n\nL-209 It's also an old proverb, that, \"Fools will walk with hobnailed shoes, where Angels fear to trod.\" Certainly.\n\nL-210 Now, what is the transformation? (Quickly.) How do we get it? What does the transformation? God does it by the Spirit of His Word. He transforms. He plants His Seed, throws His Spirit on It, and It brings forth the product. His Holy Spirit transforms the Seed Word in to be vindicated of its kind.\n\nL-211 What kind of a seed you are, that shows just what's in you. You can't hide it. Whatever you are inside, it shows outside. You just can't keep from it. You can't make that tree anything but what it is. See, it's--it's going to be that way. The Holy Spirit transforms the seeds that's on the inside of it. No matter what kind of a seed it is, It'll transform it. If it's evil, it'll bring forth evil. If it's a hypocrite, it'll bring forth a hypocrite. If it's a genuine Word of God, it'll bring forth a genuine son or daughter of God, through a thinking man's Filter. When the Seed comes up, it comes through That, It produces a son and daughter of God.\n\nL-212 One day when the world lay in the darkness of chaos, God... Now listen close, 'cause we're not going to speak... just a little bit longer. Look. One day when the world was again in all kinds of religions, washing hands, pots, wearing different robes and bonnets, and so forth, it lay in the midst of utter chaos. The genuine Israel of God had been so perverted from the laws and statutes of God, Jesus said, \"You, with your traditions, make the Word of God of no effect to the people, by your traditions.\" And look at them holy priests, they call them; and Jesus said, \"You are of your father, the Devil, and his works you do.\" See, that's exactly what He said. [Matthew 15:6], [John 8:44]\n\nL-213 Now when the world lay in that kind of a fix, God's Spirit moved again upon a Seed that was predestinated. He translated and transformed Isaiah 9:6 of Its promise; He, God, was made in human flesh, to save that chaos time. When man was made in the image of God, here comes God, by the prophet foreseeing it... Now remember the Word, the prophet foresaw it, just the same prophet that seen Satan in this last days, see, of this educational program and things he has, religious program. The same prophet, Isaiah 9:6, said, \"Unto us a Child is born, to us a Son is given; and His Name shall be called 'Counsellor, The Prince of Peace, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father.' And of His reign there will be no end.\" And that Word is God's Word. And the Spirit moved upon that Word, and It formed in the womb of a virgin; a man, \"a son is born,\" not created, \"born.\" [Isaiah 9:6-7]\n\nL-214 Satan tried and tried again, to spray It. He took Him up and said, \"If You are what You say You are, then do some of this healing here for me. Show me how You can do it. Turn this, bread, and this stones into bread. Let's see you take a dive, because the Scripture says You'll do it.\"\n\nL-215 You see them religious devils today still saying that same thing? \"If there is such a thing as Divine healing; here 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min lays Brother So-and-so, let's see you heal him.\"\n\nL-216 That same Devil stood at Jesus, at the cross, said, \"If Thou be the Son of God, come down off the cross.\" [Matthew 27:40]\n\nL-217 The Word said He was the Son of God. The Spirit proved He was the Son of God. Isaiah 9:6 was fulfilled. And the other night, many of you in the broadcast heard how that we give sixty-some-odd Scriptures, almost, I believe, about proving that the Scripture said that That was Him.\n\nL-218 Oh, Satan tried and tried again, do everything. One night, laying on the back of a ship, he seen Him asleep. And he said, \"I'll destroy Him right now.\" But he couldn't.\n\nL-219 He tried to tempt Him into doing the wrong thing, but he couldn't do it. Why? He had been sprayed with the repellent of predestination. It can't be deceived. No, no. The Word said He would be here. Amen. There ain't no devil going to bother Him, and no other son of God, that's predestinated to take his place. He is sprayed with a repellent. Satan's poison, denominational doctors don't even touch Him at all. He moves right along, nothing going to bother him, see. It didn't have any effect upon Him.\n\nL-220 \"Well, I'll make You the bishop of all the earth. I have rule over it. If You'll just worship me, come on join my group, I'll--I'll make You the ruler. I'll step down, let You up.\"\n\nL-221 He said, \"Get behind Me, Satan. It is written, 'Thou shall worship God, the Word, and Him only shall Thou serve.'\" Then one day... On this great Person, I'd like to stay there a while. [Luke 4:8]\n\nL-222 But one day, the Spirit moved upon Him again; 'cause there was some Word had been wrote about Him, come from God, through the prophet, \"And He was led to the slaughter, like a lamb.\" And the Spirit moved upon Him, and led Him, and sent Him to Calvary's cross. There He died. And everything that was spoke of Him in His death, was fulfilled, to bring Light and Life to all the predestinated seed of God that was upon the earth. He brought the way to do it. Here is the Seed, the Spirit brings the Life; transforming sons and daughters of God, from the world in this dark chaos, in to be sons and daughters of God. [Acts 8:32-33], [Isaiah 53:7-8]\n\nL-223 Don't stumble at that word \"predestination.\" I know you do. But, listen, It's not my word. It's one of God's Words. You want to read it, read Ephesians 1:5, which, \"He has predestinated us to the adoptions of sons through Jesus Christ.\" See? [Ephesians 1:5]\n\nL-224 Just let me just break it just a minute, just a minute, to break this out of your mind. Look. Just as you were in your father, at the beginning, a germ seed. Did you know that, every one of you? You were in your great-great-great-grandfather, also, did you know that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-225 Read the Book of Hebrews, where that we find that Levi paid tithes when he was in the loins of Abraham, four generations behind him. When Abraham paid tithes to Melchisedec, it was accounted to his great-greatgrandson down below him, and he was then in the loins of Abraham. There you are. See? [Hebrews 7:9]\n\nL-226 You were in the loins of your father, but your father could not have any fellowship with you until you was transformed into a body of flesh.\n\nL-227 My son there was in me. I--I--I wanted a son, but he was in me then. See? He was in me then. But through wedlock, he was transformed into a man like me, and then he become like me.\n\nL-228 And you become like your parents, see, 'cause it was in you, to begin with. Now if we are the sons of God, His attributes... Which, you are an attribute of your father, not your mother; your father. The germ lays in the father. See? And now your mother was an incubator that bear you, bear the seed of your father. See?\n\nL-229 And the earth, in flesh, is also the incubator that bears the seed of God. See, just exactly. Not the world, how great the world is; it's how great the God that made it. See? See?\n\nL-230 Now if you are a son and daughter of God, then you were in God at the beginning. You're His attribute. If you wasn't there then, then you never was or never will be. 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min\n\nL-231 Cause, I cannot bear, from my loins, the son of this man here or that man there, I can only bear my own sons, and they would bear my likeness. Hallelujah. You see it?\n\nL-232 Sons and daughters was in God at the beginning. Now look. You've got Eternal Life, you say. We believe it, that we got Eternal Life. Well, there is only one form of Eternal Life, and that's God. That's the only thing that is Eternal, is God. Then if you've got Eternal Life, that Life that's in you always was, and you were in the loins of God before there even was a world. And when the Word Itself... Jesus Himself is called the Word, and in St. John 1, said, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\" Then you were in the loins of Jesus, and went to Calvary with Him. You died with Him, and you raised with Him. And today we're sitting in Heavenly places in Him, filled with His Spirit, sons and daughters of God. Die with Him, raised with Him. Sure.\n\nL-233 Now then, now, now you can fellowship with Him. You couldn't back there, because you were just a Word in Him, a seed. But now He has manifested you, and now He wants you to fellowship with Him. Then He came down, was made flesh so He could perfectly fellowship with you. See the perfect fellowship? Oh, my, them deep mysteries of God! How wonderful! See, God could not fellowship in the Spirit, so God became man with us. [I Timothy 3:16]\n\nL-234 Jesus Christ was God Himself, manifested, 'cause, He was a son because He was begotten, but it was just a tabernacle for Him to live in. \"No man has seen God at any time, but the only Begotten of the Father has declared Him.\" God built Himself a house, a body to live in, come down so that you could touch Him. I Timothy 3:16, \"Without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness; for God was manifested in the flesh, seen of Angels, believed on, received up into Heaven.\" See? Now He... [I Timothy 3:16]\n\nL-235 You being flesh, and Him being flesh, then you can fellowship with one another, 'cause He was God's attribute of love. God is love. Is that right? And Jesus was God's attribute of love. And when the attribute of love was displayed, which, that was God Himself; all the attributes that hung onto Him, come to Him, \"All the Father has given Me, will come to Me.\" Sure, they had to be predestinated. If it wasn't, you won't be there. That's all. Certainly. [John 6:37]\n\nL-236 Now we can fellowship, was through the--the riches of His Word, and in which you are a part of. You are part of the Word; 'cause He was the Word at the beginning, you're the Word now. See? I'm preaching tonight, or Sunday or one of the days when I get in, about what the Word is, see. And now you are part of the Word.\n\nL-237 Listen. There is one thing I can't do. I can't brag on my ancestors. No, I come through an awful mess. My father was an Irishman. My mother was an Indian squaw, half Indian; her mother was an Indian, drawed a pension. Now, all of them, drunks, most all of them died with their shoes on, fighting, gunfighters, and so forth. I can't brag on nothing about that, 'cause my ancestors and my family tree is terrible.\n\nL-238 But, brother, there is one thing I can brag on, I can brag on my Lord Jesus Who has redeemed me. And with His transforming power planted a seed, by predestination, and I saw It. Whose son am I now? Yeah. I can brag on Him. And I have spent thirty-three years of my life, bragging on Him. If He would spare me another thirty-three years, I'll try to brag more on Him. See? I can brag on my Ancestor, hallelujah, He that redeemed me and planted the seed of Life in here, and let me look down upon this Word, sent down His Spirit and said, \"Here It is. Speak this, and it will happen. Do that.\" And oh, my, I can brag on Him! How did He do it? Through the washing of the water by the Word, the waters of separation, which...?... explain. [Ephesians 5:26-27]\n\nL-239 True predestinated believers will stay with the Word because they are part of that Word.\n\nL-240 Oh, wandering stars, how long will you wonder? You Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterian, outsiders, whatever you might be, wandering stars, from church to church, from pillar to place, and television to television, world to world, why don't you come on? He longs to have fellowship with you. He is longing for you. He wants to transform you by the renewing of your mind, not to the church or to the denomination, but to His Word, which, you are a part if that desire is in you.Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness: for they shall be filled. (See? Uh-huh.) [Matthew 5:6], [Jude 1:13]\n\nL-241 And it's sent His transforming Power, to bring you out of this deformity of religion that you're in. In this 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min deformity chaos that we're in, God has sent His transforming Power, His Word, vindicated, proven, to bring you out of this religious deformity of ignorance that you're walking in, \"naked, blind, miserable, and don't know it.\" Think of it, friends. [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-242 You know, God sent His transforming power to fulfill His Word, and changed the whole body of Sarah and Abraham. Transformed an old man and an old woman, because He promised He would do it.\n\nL-243 And what God promises to do, that He'll do. There is nothing, anything... Any perverted thing, God can't do nothing with it. But He will keep His Word, and He'll send His Spirit! \"I the Lord have planted It. I will water It day and night, lest some should pluck it from My hands.\" The Bible says that. [Isaiah 27:2-3]\n\nL-244 Oh, wandering stars, you with the desire in your heart! You've got to have it, or you wouldn't be sitting here this morning. And you wouldn't be in those churches and auditoriums, and things you're in, out and across the land, if Something wouldn't even bring you in there. Some person spoke to you. Don't go any further. There is a washing of the water by the Word, that will make you white as snow. Oh, sons of God, listen! Don't stay in that deformity. Come out of it. Abraham believed God, and called anything contrary... [Ephesians 5:26], [Jude 1:13]\n\nL-245 You say, \"How would I make my living? How would I do this?\" That's God's business. \"How would I? My associates would turn me down.\"\n\nL-246 God said, \"He that will forsake His own father, mother, wife, husband, homes, houses; I'll give them homes and houses, I'll give them fathers and mothers, and brothers and sisters, in this world, and Eternal Life in the world to come.\" It's a promise, friend. That, oh, that's got to be watered! Every promise God makes comes to pass. Every Seed of God is a promise. [Matthew 19:29]\n\nL-247 And, sister, stop bobbing that hair, because it's an uncommon thing before God. Quit wearing those clothes, it's an abomination to Him! [I Corinthians 11:6]\n\nL-248 You brothers, you man, stop catering to these denominations, in doing the things, and letting your wives do such things. It's unbecoming to Christians.\n\nL-249 Come back to the Word! Take that Word, It'll grow. It's got to grow. God's transforming power that brought It up in the first place, He's just on His road back, taking It back again now. He's going right back again to where it was.\n\nL-250 Enoch was translated, from death, by God's transforming power. What did God do that for? For a type of the rapturing Church that's coming. Yeah. Elijah was the same. [Hebrews 11:5], [II Kings 2:11]\n\nL-251 Jesus' body was quickened after it was dead. And in the grave, Jesus' body was quickened by the Word of God; and transformed, from a dead, cold image, to a resurrected, glorified Son of God. Because the prophet, Psalms 16:10, if you want to put it down, 16:10, said, \"I will not leave His soul in hell, neither will I suffer My Holy One to see corruption.\" O God! [Acts 2:27], [Psalms 16:10]\n\nL-252 That Word has to come to pass, It's God's Word! Plant It in your heart, if you want to go in a Rapture. If you want to be Christians genuine, place this Word. As I believe it was Ezekiel, God said, \"Take that scroll and eat it up,\" that the prophet and the Word would become the same. And every promise in there has to manifest itself, because it's God's original Seed. Don't you let some educated theologian out here try to pump It out of you. Don't you let him spray you with that carnal science and knowledge, and education. Believe God! [Ezekiel 3:1]\n\nL-253 Abraham didn't take the scientific research of his day, say, \"I'm too old to have a baby, I've went too far. I've done this, that, or the other.\" But he called anything that was contrary, to God's Word, as though it wasn't. And he staggered not at the promise of God, through unbelief; but was strong, giving praise to God. He knowed that God was able to perform that what He had promised. [Romans 4:20]\n\nL-254 Oh, wandering sons, deformed by the creepers of this earth! Wandering sisters, that the places and fashions of this world has drawed you! And, sister dear, you might consider me an old crank, but one of these days when you meet what Florence Shakarian met the other night; she sat in this room, too, in this place, as you know. When you meet that, you'll find out that, not me, but this Word is right. Keep out of those barber shops, those fashion shops. Keep out of 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min those things.\n\nL-255 Say, \"Why don't you teach them great things, how to be this?\" Just start with your ABC's, and then we'll come to algebra. See? Just start learning, \"which is your reasonable service.\"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your body a living sacrifice, holy, and acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. [Romans 12:1]\n\nL-256 You just do \"Your reasonable service,\" God will take care of the rest of it; see, just to reason things that you can reason out yourself and do. Isn't it not... Isn't it unreasonable for a woman to strip herself down, and go out here and act like that, when the Bible condemns it? Isn't it unreasonable for a man to pull hisself into such a dogma as we have today, and all this stuff here, and all this seminary stuff, and stuff like that, when it's absolutely contrary to the Word of God? See? [Romans 12:1-2]\n\nL-257 Isaiah's lips, he was just an ordinary man of unclean lips. He said, \"Lord, I'm among unclean people, and I got unclean lips. Woe is me because I've seen God.\" And an Angel come down, got a Fire, Holy Fire off of God's altar, and transformed his lips; from the lips of a wandering man, to the lips of a prophet with THUS SAITH THE LORD. God's transforming Power! [Isaiah 6:5]\n\nL-258 A hundred and twenty fishermen, and--and little old sellers of purple, of women, and those gathered themselves in an upper room and closed the doors, some of them not enough education to sign their own names. God transformed them from fishers, to fishers of man; from men and women on the street, to saints of God, immortal. The transforming Power of God! [Acts 1:13-14]\n\nL-259 Paul, a local church member, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal, or something; down the street he went, with his great defying spirit in him, that he knowed more than any of them. He had come up under Gamaliel, one of the best teachers there was in the land. What happened on his road down to Damascus, get a bunch of people who was believing God's Word? On his road down there, was stricken down, and he heard a Message. And It transformed him from a church member and a church goer; to a prophet of God, who wrote the Word of God, in the New Testament. From a church member to a saint!\n\nL-260 Oh, wandering star, let's stop. Wandering son, wandering Seed that's going from place to place, in this deformity; turn, this morning, children. Please hear me as a--as a man that's trying to stand between the living and the dead. [Jude 1:13]\n\nL-261 Out over the land where the broadcast is coming if you're still hooked up, you that's wandered into the place, please sit just a minute longer. I know it's late here in Tuscon or, beg you pardon me, Phoenix, it's twenty minutes till twelve. And I've had these people here all morning. I've had you away from your work and things. But look, dear friend, you might be away from God forever. Please come back this morning. Won't you? There is room at the Fountain. In a manger long ago, I know it's really so, A Babe was born to save men from their sin. John saw Him on the shore, the Lamb forevermore, Oh, Christ, the Crucified of Calvary. Oh, I love that Man from Galilee, from Galilee, For He's done so very much for me. He's forgiven all my sins, placed the Holy Ghost within; Oh, I love, I love that Man from Galilee. A publican went to pray in the temple there one day, He cried, \"O Lord, be merciful to me!\" He was forgiven of every sin, and a deep peace placed within; He said, \"Come see this Man from Galilee.\" Right. The lame was made to walk, the dumb was made to talk, That power was spoken with love upon the sea; 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min The blind was made to see, I know it could only be The mercy of that Man from Galilee.\n\nL-262 Type that with the ministry today. The woman at the well, He all her sins did tell, How five husbands she had at that time. She was forgiven of every sin, and a deep peace placed within; She cried, \"Come see this Man from Galilee!\"\n\nL-263 Woman, He knew. See, He has read your heart this morning. Man, He has read your heart. Oh, publican, let's pray! Oh, I love that Man from Galilee, from Galilee, For He's done so very much for me. He's forgiven all my sins, placed the Holy Ghost within; Oh, I love, I love that Man from Galilee.\n\nL-264 Won't you love Him, with me, this morning? Oh, wayward, wandering sinner, here or out where you may be, will you accept my Lord this morning? He is the Word, and the Word has been brought to you. Won't you accept Him this morning? Will you just raise your hands or stand to your feet, or something, and pray, say, \"I want to accept Him right now. Brother, I'm willing, I'm willing right now to accept Him.\" Will you stand to your feet, anybody that wanted to be prayed, and say, \"I am...\" prayed for, rather, \"I am a sinner. I want...\" God bless you, sir. Someone else? Everybody pray now, just a minute. Oh, in that manger long ago, (it was in a chaos, you know, the world was), and I know it's really so, A little Babe was born to save man from their sin. When John saw Him on the shore, He was that Lamb forevermore, (same One today) Oh, He is Christ, the Crucified of Calvary.\n\nL-265 Won't you love Him today with all your heart, so you can walk out of this worldly condition that you sit in? You women, you man, oh, what did you sit here all of this time for? It goes to show there is something down in you, there is something there hungering and thirsting. You wouldn't have set here these two or three hours, sitting in this building like this; there is something. Won't you just heed to it today? Let the fashions and science, and all the things of the world, pass away from your mind right now, brother dear or sister dear. The churches are uniting, the great nations are breaking, Israel is awakening, The signs that the prophets foretold; The Gentile days numbered, with harrows encumbered; \"Return, O dispersed, to your own.\" The day of redemption is near, Men's hearts are failing for fear; Be filled with the Spirit, have your lamps trimmed and clear, Look up, your redemption is near! False prophets are lying, God's Truth they're denying, That Jesus the Christ is our God.\n\nL-266 Now, that's true. You know that, all of us, the day that we're living. But He said it shall be Light about the evening time, The way to Glory you will surely find.\n\nL-267 That's the day we're living in right now. The Light will shine just at the evening when the darkness is setting in, twilight time, the evening star. Twilight and evening star, And after that the dark! May there be no sadness of farewell, 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min When I'm at last embarked; For all without is bourne of time and space, And the floods may bear me far, But I want to see my Pilot face to face When I have crossed the bar. Tell me not, in mournful numbers, That life is just an empty dream! And the soul is dead that slumbers, And things are not what they seem. Yea, life is real! And life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; For dust thou art, to dust returnest, Was not spoken of the soul. Lives of great men all remind us, And we can make our lives sublime, And, partings, leave behind us, Footprints on the sands of time; Footprints, that perhaps another, While sailing over life's solemn main, A forlorn and shipwrecked brother, In seeing, shall take heart again. Let us be up, then, and doing, With a heart for any strife; Be not like dumb, driven cattle! Be a hero in the strife!\n\nL-268 Dear God, they're Yours. I've seen two men stand to their feet, Father. I pray, God, that You will take them now. They want to be Your sons. They have woke up from the ignorance of the life that they have lived, and now they want to be afreshed, anewed, with the baptism of the Holy Spirit upon that Seed that's been planted in their hearts this day. Eternal God, the Creator of all things, Who made Your Word, and I believe that You knew these men would do this this morning. I pray, Lord, that You will water that Word, day and night, and never let Satan to pluck it from Your hands. May it be a tree that sometimes, in the Paradise of God, when it's all brought back again, for Your Word cannot fail, it'll be again. For this world...\n\nL-269 And there will not be this kind of a civilization in the world to come. There will be no automobiles or nothing that science has ever done. There will be no such things in the world that is to come. But it will be God's Own type of civilization that He'll set up in the glorious reign. For, in this civilization there is sickness, death, sorrow, graves, and want. But in that Kingdom that is to come, there is no death, no sorrow, no sickness, no old age. O God, it'll all be new there, in Your civilization.\n\nL-270 God, transform us today, by Your Power, by the renewing of our mind, to turn from the meager elements of this world now, unto the Word of God. And may we be renewed by the transforming Power of God upon the Seed that's in our heart, that we believe, unto creatures called sons and daughters of God. This is my prayer to You, Father, for the people, in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-271 Now to you that's out into the broadcast, wherever you are, I want you to receive Christ out there, as your personal Saviour, and be filled with His Spirit. The Words that's been said this morning, may they drop into your heart. And may there you receive Jesus. And you watch your life, and you see what you live afterwards. And take the thinking man's Filter here. When you see yourself doing something that's contrary to this Word, move from it, right quick. See? Because, there is a Filter that keeps death away from you, that's God's Word. His Words are Life, and they 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min will keep you from death.\n\nL-272 And to you people here now that's in the auditorium, I've had you here a long time. I thank you for your attendance. I pray that God will never let this Seed die. I hope you don't think I stand here just to say these things to be different. I say it because of love; and knowing that it's while I'm mortal, as I am now, is the only time I'll ever be able to preach to people. And I love Jesus Christ. He is my Saviour. And remember, I'd have been out there on the street if it hadn't have been for Him. I'd have been out there; all my parents, all my people, were sinners. But God, with His transforming Power, I know it made a different creature out of me. And I can--I can recommend It to you, to be good. And It'll keep in the hours of trouble. Even at death, at the door, you have no fear. There is nothing can separate us from the love of God, that's in Christ.\" May God bless each one of you, and give you Eternal Life. [Romans 8:39]\n\nL-273 How many in here that doesn't have the Seed of God, the baptism of the Holy Ghost? Would you just raise your hand, say, \"Remember me, Brother Branham, that I will receive that Holy Spirit.\" Now you take the Word in your--in your heart, and believe It. Now if you... You can look at you. Go up and look at the mirror, and you can see where you are. See, you can know.\n\nL-274 You say, \"Well, I didn't raise my hand, because I believe I have.\"\n\nL-275 Look at yourself in the mirror, then you see what kind of a spirit is deceiving you, see. Deceived thinking! \"There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is the ways of death.\" Is that true?Down at the cross where my Saviour died,Down there for cleansing from sin I cried;Oh, there to my heart was the Blood applied;Glory... [Proverbs 16:25]\n\nL-276 Just close your eyes, a minute now, and just sing that to Him. Let's just raise our hands up. Glory to His Name, His precious Name! Glory to His Name! There to my heart was the Blood applied; Glory to His...\n\nL-277 I want you Christians to shake one another's hand, who is saved. I am so wondrously saved from sin, Jesus so sweetly abides within, There at the cross where He took me in; Glory to His Name! Glory to His Name, precious Name! Glory to His Name! Oh, there to my heart was the Blood applied; Glory to His Name!\n\nL-278 The Blood has the germ of Life in It, you know. This is to them who doesn't know Him. Oh, come to this Fountain so rich and sweet; Cast thy poor soul at the Saviour's feet; Oh, plunge in today, and be made complete; Glory to His Name! Oh, glory to... Let's bow our heads now as we sing it. Glory to His Name! There to my heart was the Blood applied; Glory to His Name!\n\nL-279 You love Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Paul said, \"I'll sing in the Spirit. I'll worship in the Spirit.\" Let's sing it real softly again, with our hands up.\n\nL-280 You know, the trouble of it, we Pentecostal people, we've lost our joy, we've lost our emotions. As Billy Graham 65-0911, God's Power To Transform, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 146 min said the other night, \"Them preachers, collars turned around, going down South, clapping their hands, and beating their feet up-and-down on the ground, and stomping, they had something they were happy about.\" Well, yeah, I got Something I'm happy about. See? See? Yeah. Yeah, we've lost our emotion.\n\nL-281 Now let's just raise our hands. Don't worry about the tears, they won't hurt nothing, see. That don't hurt. \"He that goeth forth sowing, in tears, will doubtless return again, bringing precious sheaves.\" All right. Glory to His Name, precious Name! Glory to His Name! There to my heart was the Blood applied; Glory to His Name! Glory to His... (O God! Praise God!) Glory to His Name! Sink the Seed, Lord, in the heart! To my heart was the Blood applied; Glory to His Name! Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

It's a privilege to be here tonight. This is my second time to be here in this Grantway Assembly, with my dear brother, Mack, and all this fine staff here, and the joining Christians from different churches, Brother Lee Vayle. And I just met a brother here, that, a--a bosom friend to Brother F. F. Bosworth, and didn't even know Brother Bosworth had gone on to meet the Lord. I said, \"I feel like I met the Elisha that poured water on Elijah's hands,\" when they had been abroad and didn't know that Brother Bosworth had gone on to meet the Lord, at eighty-four years old.\n\nL-2 Now I want to greet the folks who is on the telephone hookup tonight, across the country, all the way from California to New York, and Texas and--and up different parts of the nation, from Maine to California. So, we got a--a system of hooking up these telephones, that's been a great blessing. And now we understand, through our good friend, Brother Pearry Green, that they've got a--a little gadget they can put on your television set, and not only will it be on the telephone but it will be televised right in your television set, also. And they're seeing about it now.\n\nL-3 And, Sister Mack, I'm glad to see you looking fine, sitting here at the organ, tonight. And many of my friends I see from down at Sierra Vista, and Brother Borders... or Brother Roberson, rather, from Indiana; many. I want to say to the folks up at the tabernacle, tonight, look like half of them is down here, and from the tabernacle at Jeffersonville.\n\nL-4 And to my friend up there, Brother Kuhn, that you called in about, concerning that sick, request. I'm praying for it, Brother Kuhn. Just have faith. Don't worry. It'll be all right.\n\nL-5 And down into Texas, Brother Blair, if you are listening in tonight, my brother, just remember this; that God Who brought you through the first time, can bring you through the second. And we are believing that God will grant this to you. And don't you take the Devil's lie about anything. You just remember that God is God, and there is... and He still remains the same yesterday, today, and forever. And we love Him and believe Him, and we are praying for you.\n\nL-6 To all of our friends in California; to Brother Mercier and them up here in Arizona, many other places, Phoenix; and Brother Williams, and you all are hooked up up there tonight, all around, we are certainly grateful; and down in Georgia. And we are certainly thankful for every one of you. The Lord bless you.\n\nL-7 I have a feeling of real welcome here tonight, in this fine church, the Assembly of God here on Grantway, and with Brother Mack, my good friend. God has blessed Brother Mack. I remember one time in Canada, that he was... I was riding back a trail, on a horse, way back into the jungles, and the Holy Spirit spoke to me to get off and pray for Brother Mack. At that time he was in an emergency, and the Lord healed him. And so I'm so thankful for that, and to be assembled here tonight with him, to worship the Lord in this fine Truth.\n\nL-8 A man sitting on the platform, behind me, said, \"Don't guess you know me.\" Said, \"One time you picked me up, as a hitchhiker,\" and, I don't know, somewhere up in Boston or somewhere, \"Detroit, hitchhiking.\"\n\nL-9 And I said, \"Well, I usually try to have a hand out, if I can, for those who are needy.\"\n\nL-10 And so, tonight, we're all needy. And we pray that God will give us a hand tonight, of help, of blessings, and of His grace and mercy.\n\nL-11 Now, I'm kind of prone to speaking a long time, but I'll try not to do that tonight. Cause, the people up in Ohio just called, Mrs. Dauch and the group up there, Brother McKinney and Brother Brown, and all them hooked in through Ohio. We send you greetings, also. It's late up in New York, and I suppose it's about eleven or twelve o'clock, at this time, in New York. And the churches come and waited till this hour, just for the service. We are grateful for those fine friends around everywhere.\n\nL-12 Now before we open the Word, let's just speak to the Author, a moment, while we bow our heads.\n\nL-13 Dear Heavenly Father, we are... our hearts are overjoyed, for the privilege that we have of being alive here tonight, 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min and assembled together with Your people. The people... and who we believe to live forever. We now possess Eternal Life, because, \"You gave Your only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting Life.\" In His pilgrimage here on the earth, He taught us, \"He that heareth My Word and believeth on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life; and shall not come into the judgment, but has passed from death unto Life, because we believed on the only begotten Son of God.\" How we thank You for this great Saviour! And we pray, tonight, that His great Presence will so bless us together here, as we read of His Word and speak on It. Let the Holy Spirit take that to each heart throughout the nation, Lord, wherever people are gathered together. [John 3:16], [John 5:24]\n\nL-14 Bless other ministers who are in the pulpit. We pray, Father, that You will bless this Grantway Assembly; its pastor, his wife, his children; the deacons, trustees, and all the board. And, Father, together may we work for the Kingdom of God, while it's enough Light to see where we're getting around, for the hour is coming when no man can work. And, Father, while we have this privilege, may we--may we redeem the time, Lord. May we, that be granted to us. Heal the sick and the afflicted throughout the land. May the Presence of God be felt in every crack and corner of the nation, tonight.\n\nL-15 We realize that judgment is striking. Great faults are falling in, and the nation is shaking, and earthquakes in divers places. Great historical things that we've heard of in the days past, of judgment, through the Bible, and we see it repeating again today. The prophecy saying, \"As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man. As it was in the days of Lot, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man,\" and we see it happening now. \"Man's hearts failing; perplexity of time; distress between nations.\" God, we know we're at the end time. [Luke 17:26], [Luke 21:25]\n\nL-16 Help us, Lord, to--to take the Message to every crack and corner, to every child that You've ordained to Life. Grant it, Lord. We ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. Lord, bless the reading now of His Word.\n\nL-17 Now many of you like to kind of look into the Bible, where a minister is reading. And I want to read tonight, a couple, three verses out of the Psalms, Psalm 42, just for the way of having a text. And I've got some Scriptures written out here, and I want to refer to them, if I can, as we go along in the next few minutes, to speak on this subject. The Psalm of David. David wrote the Psalms. [Psalms 42:1-3]\n\nL-18 Now while you're turning, I might say this. Many people say, \"Well, is the Psalms inspired?\" Certainly, they are. They're...\n\nL-19 Anything that's--that's in this Bible is inspired, whether it's history, whether it's songs, whatever it is. It's inspired. Jesus said, \"Have not you read what David said in the Psalms?\" And then I think, Psalms, of course, is songs. And if songs are inspired of God, which, I believe they are, and prophetic also, I hope I am standing that day when this song comes to pass. There is going to be a meeting in the air, In that sweet, sweet by and by; Going to meet you, and greet you over there; In that Home beyond the sky; Such singing ever heard, ever heard by mortal ears, It'll be glorious, I do declare! And God's Own Son will be the leading One At that meeting in the air. Oh, I--I want to be there at that time!\n\nL-20 Now Psalm 42. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night, while my... while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? [Psalms 42:1-3] 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min\n\nL-21 I think, David, in the writing of this Psalm, must have been in distress. And it usually takes distress to bring the best out of a man. It, really, that's when God... gets down to when we fast, many times, to get ourself in position to get ourself out of the way. And I think, when David got in these places, then he begin to meditate on the Lord, begin to think about the things.\n\nL-22 Many times, God gets us in--in tight corners where we have to look up. Sometimes we even have to get on our back in the hospital, or a bed somewhere, so we can look up to see where the great blessings of God comes from.\n\nL-23 Now the word I want to speak from tonight, one word out of the Bible, and that is found in the 2nd verse, \"thirst,\" the word: Thirst. I was looking in the dictionary when I was looking up this word.\n\nL-24 I was thinking about a--a sermon one time, I preached on \"Thirsting After Life.\" And I took it out of the Psalms, too, when David said, \"Thy statutes,\" I believe, \"are more precious to me than life.\"\n\nL-25 Then I was looking and thinking about that word \"thirst,\" so I looked up in the dictionary, to see what it means. And here is what Webster says, \"It's a painful desire,\" a painful, when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you.\n\nL-26 Now, it's--it's not an unnatural thing, to thirst. Thirst is a--a natural thing. It's just simply something that God has given us, that we could, to give us a--a desire for something. Sometimes God has, also, has given you a--a control tower, something that sets inside of you, that--that controls these different desires. And this thirst, this control tower that sets in a man's heart, is something that God give him to--to warn him of the desires that's needful for him.\n\nL-27 Now there is two different kinds of thirst. There is a thirst, physically. And there is a thirst, also, spiritually. I would like to read this, what David said, again. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God:... [Psalms 42:2]\n\nL-28 Not some historical, or some something that happened some years ago, or--or some tale that someone told; but, \"for the living God,\" a God that's ever present. And his soul thirsted for that God, not for some historical something. [Psalms 42:2]\n\nL-29 Now we find, God gives the control tower to you, to give to you the things that you need. Now, the control tower in you is what directs you. And this thirst runs in on this co-... tower, control tower, and tells you what you have need of, spiritually speaking. The control tower in the body, and in the soul, also. There is a control tower in the body, that tells you the need that's needed in your body, and it's brought to you by thirst. Also, there is a control tower in your soul, that tells you the spiritual things that you have need of, something in your spirit, and, and you by this can tell what kind of a life is controlling you.\n\nL-30 When you--when you can see what your desires are, then you can tell, by that, what kind of something that's in you, that's creating this desire that you have. See, there is a certain thing that you thirst for, and it--and it can tell you in your soul what this desire is, by the nature of the thirst that you have. I hope that you can understand that. [Matthew 7:16-20]\n\nL-31 There is a--a control tower of the soul, and one for the body, and each tower is a warning caller for the needs of the other. Each one calls to the need for what the caller is calling for, it sends out a wave of warning.\n\nL-32 For instance, the--the flesh thirst to satisfy the desires that's in the body, and the spirit desires for the things that's in the soul, desire is, and many times these war one against the other. We find there, what's a great trouble today, that too many people try to live between those two desires. For, one of them desires the things of the earth, the other desires the things of Heaven.\n\nL-33 Like Paul said, describes it in Romans 7:21, \"When I would do good, then evil is nigh.\" When you try, did you ever have that in experience, Christians? That when you're trying to do something that's worth-while, go to make an effort to do something that's good, then you find out that there is the Devil, on every hand, just to upset you, everything that you'd... And that's one good thing, that. I'd like to say this, that the Christians might know. That when you are--when you are starting to do something, and there is something always trying to upset you in doing it, do it anyhow. 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min That's the Devil there, trying to keep you from doing what's right. [Romans 7:21]\n\nL-34 Now, many times, I meet people that's prone to be a little nervous. When they find out that they're trying to do something, and--and everything is just blocking it off on both sides, they say, \"It might not been the will of the Lord.\" See? Now don't let the Devil lie to you like that.\n\nL-35 The first thing, is find out whether it's the will of God, or not. And then if you want to know whether it's the will of God, look into the Bible. There is the thing that--that sets you straight, is the Word of God; and then if you see it's in the Word of God, for you to do it.\n\nL-36 Like, for instance, seeking for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Many times, I've run into people, say, \"Well, I have sought for the Holy Ghost, and I just couldn't receive It. I don't believe It's for me. Every time I get down, I get sick. And I go to praying, if I fast, I get sick. And if I try to stay all night, I stay up, I get so sleepy. I--I can't get off my feet.\" Remember, that is the Devil. Because, God intends for you to have the Holy Spirit. It's for whosoever will. [Galatians 4:6], [Acts 2:38-39]\n\nL-37 Many times you find, when you're prayed for, in a meeting, for Divine healing, then the next day you find out, no doubt, that the Devil will make that twice as bad as it was the day before. See? Remember, that's just Satan trying to get you away from the blessing that God has got for you. See? Don't you listen to that fellow. See? Always press right on.\n\nL-38 I had an experience with that just recently on the road to Africa. If I ever had any time that the Devil ever did press at me, was to go to Africa this last time. It become one of the--the finest meetings and times that I ever went overseas. I got, I believe, more things accomplished in that little time that I was there, besides my hunting trip, than I ever did at any time. I had always thought that those churches didn't want me there, and come to find out... I had a letter from someone, that it was, oh, they didn't want me there, all the association; and found out it was one man, with a letterhead from an organization, that said, \"We don't want you,\" he meant him and his family. See? So then when I got over there... See, just \"we,\" that was he and his family; and it wasn't the people, at all. So, now it's a great field opened up for us.\n\nL-39 You see, when Paul said, \"When I would do good, then evil is nigh.\" [Romans 7:21]\n\nL-40 You let a young convert come tonight to the altar, somewhere here in this tabernacle, or--or out across the nation; and just remember, tomorrow, mother will be more angry than she ever was, dad will be all upset, and all the school kids. And everything just goes wrong, because it's Satan trying to get you to turn around. He is trying to run you off the Path. \"When I would do good, then evil is always nigh.\"\n\nL-41 Now let us look at the thirst, and let's see whether actually a thirst is a natural thing. I've had people to tell me, \"Oh, I never did. I believe it's just for some people to want to be Christians.\" Oh, no. That's wrong. It's actually something that's associated with every human being. It certainly is true. When we come to this country in the early days, we found the Indians here. And the Indians, though they were heathen at that time, they worshiped the sun or something. As long as they are human, there is something in them, a natural thirst, calling out for God, somewhere.\n\nL-42 Back in the jungles, just recently back there, four hundred and eighty miles from the closest civilization, a little, small town of about three thousand people, of Beira, in Mozambique. We found natives that didn't even... never seen a white person. I found a native girl, she had no clothes on, (any of them hardly have clothes on), and she was sitting up in a tree. And I was tracking the lion, and there was... I heard something like a human being, screaming. This native girl sitting up there, walleyed, holding a baby. And what she was scared about... That's her only protection, is get up a tree, from a lion, leopard or something, or some animal. And she had seen me, and heard it was a human being, but when she looked and seen a white person! She had never seen one in her life, see, and she was scared to death. See?\n\nL-43 But when we find those people, even in that primitive condition back there, they were still worshiping. Before we called the lion in, they poured out some mealie meal (that's what they eat) on a little leaf, and clap their hands, and called on the spirit of some great something they didn't know where (like a patron saint or something, to a Catholic), to protect them, that they wouldn't be killed during the time of the charge of this lion. 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min\n\nL-44 See, it's something natural. It's not an unnatural thing to thirst for God. It's a natural thing. It's just something that you should do. God has made you up like that. And it's no super human, it's just actually a common human being. It ain't just special for some people.\n\nL-45 They say, \"Well, I've seen some people live such a--a victorious life, that they're constantly on the housetop, they're praising God. Wish I could feel that way.\" Well, the reason you are feeling that way, it's the thirst in you. And it's just a natural thing. It's for every person, to thirst for God.\n\nL-46 Now we'll take some of the natural. Thirst is first. Let's take, for instance, thirsting for water. As David said here, thirsting for, of \"the water.\" Thirsting for water, the body is in need of water. And if you don't supply that thirst, you'll perish. You will dehydrate, and you'll--you won't live. If you can't get water to that thirst, to quench that thirst of the natural body you will soon perish. You won't live long. You can live longer without food than you can without water. Because, you can fast for forty days (Jesus did), I suppose, without--without food, but you couldn't do that long without water. You would just simply dry up and die. You must have water. And--and the thirst that comes on you, why, it's to show that the body is in need of something, to keep it alive. The body has got to have the water, in order to stay alive. You are eighty-something percent of water and petroleum, anyhow, and you've got to take these sources in, to keep you alive. As I have said, if you neglect it you'll perish. [Psalms 42:1]\n\nL-47 The thirst also is an alarm. It's an alarm clock, that thirsting. The soul sets off alarm clock, a little buzzer inside of you that tells you that death has lurking nigh. That, if you don't get water pretty soon, you've got to die. And it gets louder and louder, until finally you keep putting it off and you'll die, because it's an alarm clock.\n\nL-48 Like David described it here in the Psalms, \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.\" As the hart panteth after the water brook! [Psalms 42:1]\n\nL-49 I've often thought, as reading of this of David. David was a woodsman, a hunter. And he hunted deer, of course. And many of we, in this day, hunt them. The hart is a deer.\n\nL-50 And we find, if you ever seen the dogs, the wild dogs will grab a deer. And usually they got, like the coyote, a fang. And he can grab the deer right above the burr of the ear, here, and swing his weight. He cuts the throat of the deer, and the deer doesn't have a chance then. But sometimes the--the--the dog, like in Africa there, the wild dog will grab the deer right in the flanks, if he misses the throat. He'll grab, the second time, at the flank. And if the deer is strong enough and quick enough, he can shake the dog off.\n\nL-51 The deer is much faster. The dog stalks him when he's not looking, and when he is up wind from him, and--and he--he don't know the--the dog is near.\n\nL-52 And then, when the wild dog grabs him, if he's real quick, he can throw it off. And, but when the dog comes out of the flank, he has got a whole mouthful of the deer's flesh. Or, when he grabs at his neck sometimes, he'll cut close to the jugular vein, and miss it. And the deer, shaking him, will pull a whole chunk of meat out of the deer's throat, then the blood begins to run.\n\nL-53 And then the dog will come right on the trail of that blood, after the deer. And as the life of the deer begins to dwindle, as the blood, which is the life stream to the body, as that begins to dwindle down, the deer gets weaker. And the dog then, or the wolf, is right behind the deer.\n\nL-54 Now, if that deer can't find water! Now, water has something in it, that, when the deer drinks the water, it stops the bleeding. But if he don't get water to cool him off, then the--the blood keeps flowing out faster; because he is running, keeping his heart pumping. But if he can ever get to water, the deer will live.\n\nL-55 Now there is a great lesson there, see, and David saying here, \"As the hart panteth for the water brook, my soul panteth for Thee, O God.\" [Psalms 42:1]\n\nL-56 Now that deer knows, unless he finds water he's gone. He just can't live. I have tracked them many times after being wounded. When he hits a stream of water, he will cross in and get a drink, go up over the hill; come back down, cross, get a drink of water and go up. You'll never catch up with him, as long as he'll follow that stream. But once when 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min he leaves the stream, if he can't find another water brook somewhere, you'll catch him right away. And now the deer knows that, so he'll stay right with the water, where he can get to it right quick. Now could you imagine a deer with his nose up, he has been caught out somewhere where there is no water?\n\nL-57 And he says, \"As the hart thirsts or panteth (is a thirst) after the water brooks, my soul thirsts after Thee, O God. Unless I can find You, Lord, I'll perish. I--I--I can't go unless I find You!\"And when a man or woman, boy or girl, gets that kind of a thirst for God, he is going to find something. See? [Psalms 42:1]\n\nL-58 But when we come at it, just kind of halfway, \"Well, I'll kneel down and see what the Lord does.\" See, you're not really thirsting yet. It's got to be a thirst between death and Life, and then something takes place.\n\nL-59 The deer, also here he's... We find that he also has another sense, of smell, that sets off an alarm in him when his enemy is near. He is possessed, this little creature, with a--a sense to protect himself. And he's--he's got a little alarm in him, a little something, that he tickles his nose when the enemy is near. You can get in the wind of the enemy, and he knows that you're there, and he is gone. Sometimes a half a mile away, he can smell you and get away, or the wolf or any danger. He is able to sense it because that he is made up that way. He is a deer, by nature. And that sense in him is just one that God give him, senses to him, to live by.\n\nL-60 And I thought, comparing the deer with a man that's thirsting for God, before the enemy gets there. There is something about a child of God, that when you once are born into the Spirit of God, receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit, there is something about the person that can sense the enemy. You can take a man when he's taking the Scripture, and reading the Scripture and try to inject something to that Scripture, that's contrary to the Scripture, a man that's filled with the Holy Ghost can [Brother Branham snaps his finger--Ed.] sense that, right quick. There is something out of the way. When he gets into a place, and--and that little certain sense in there, that it's done to protect your life. You, you mustn't, you mustn't never go for anything unless it's exactly the Word of God. You must stay right exactly with that Word. And, now, and we are secured with that sense as long as we are in the Holy Spirit.\n\nL-61 You can go to read, and like for instance, somebody say, and I go to read in Mark 16, and say, \"And these signs shall follow them that believe: In My Name they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; or take up serpents, or drink deadly things, it would not harm them; if they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-62 Now, then, you find a person get up there and say, \"Now, that was for the apostolic age.\" That, now, right quick, if you have received the Holy Spirit, you've been endowed with that sense. It sets it off. There is something wrong there. See? They try to explain it away, that it's for another day, that really you don't need those things today. But Jesus said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\" See, there is a little something sets off in you, a little buzzer, in knowing that that's wrong and that's the way of death.\n\nL-63 Cause, Jesus said, \"If we add one word to This, or take one Word from It, our part is taken out of the Book of Life.\" See, not one Scripture. We must take It just the way It's written. And God watches over His Word, to perform It, and we know that It's got to be just right. [Revelation 22:18]\n\nL-64 So therefore, no matter what a church would say, what anyone else would say, if you're born of the Spirit of God, you become part of the Bible. God told Ezekiel, he, the prophet. He said, \"Take the scroll and eat it,\" then the prophet and the scroll became part of each other. And that's the believer when he receives the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible, and the Spirit of God is the Word of God. \"My Words are Spirit. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\" Hebrews 13:8, \"He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" And when you are a part of that Word, oh, then let something come up contrary to that Word, [Brother Branham snaps his finger--Ed.] there is a little buzzer sets off right quick. See, It's to warn you that death is in the road. We should never do that. There is also... [Ezekiel 3:1], [John 1:1, 14], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-65 These thirsts are just natural. They are natural for the Christian. They are natural for the human being.\n\nL-66 There is also a thirst for success. So many people today, how we school for this thirst! We just noticed, they started the university up. And we go down there, and people spend thousands of dollars to send their children to the 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min school, and--and to universities and colleges, and so forth, to get an education, \"To be successful,\" they call it, \"in life.\" But now I have nothing against that, now, that's all right. But, to me, you could get all the schooling in the world, and still you haven't found the right success. That's right. Because, that will just temporarily make things a little easier for you here. And there is... But when you die, you leave all that behind you, and this entire economy that we have.\n\nL-67 I was saying it the other day, at Phoenix. It stand quoting again, that, \"All this modern civilization, the whole educational program, the whole scientific program, is all contrary to God's Word and His will.\" Civilization is absolutely... There will never be a civilization in the world that is to come, like this one. This is a perverted civilization. God had His first civilization upon the earth, when He spoke His Words and they come up, every seed of its kind, and in that civilization there was no death, sickness, sorrow. And now we take the things that is in the scientific world, that was put here to hold it together, and pervert it into something, and that brings death.\n\nL-68 Like the atomic bomb. I don't know the formulas of these things, but I might say this wrong. They take uranium, to split a--a molecule, and a molecule breaks into atoms. What does it do then? It just annihilates, almost, just destroys. Everything that we do!\n\nL-69 We take medicine, put this formula with this formula, to cure this, and put it into us. And what do we do? We tear down something else.\n\nL-70 Now I guess you read, read last month's Reader's Digest, that it said that, \"In this age that we're living in now, that, young men and women reach middle age between twenty and twenty-five years old.\" Think of that. Little girls in menopause, and twenty, and twenty-two and twenty-three years old, middle age. You see, what's done it, it's been this hybrid food and stuff we're eating. See, it's the stuff, the food and the--the life that we're living. Scientists has brought it to us, and, in doing so, they're killing you.\n\nL-71 I was in Africa where I'd see them boys that never had a dose of medicine in their life. They eat meat that had maggots in it. They drank out of a pool that it looked like would kill an ox. And I was shooting a target at two hundred yards, and I couldn't see it with a pair of seven-fifty binoculars. And a man my age was standing there, telling me where it was hit, with his naked eye. Now, if all this modern culture has done something... I feel if I had his eyes and his stomach, I would be a pretty good man. Yeah.\n\nL-72 But there you are, you see, that's what science, education, civilization, we're destroyed by it. We destroy ourselves. It started in the garden of Eden, and runs on for today. But, thirsting for success! Then, we thirst for fellowship. We go, we want fellowship.\n\nL-73 It's like a young man and a young woman. Now, it's not unnecessary or not (I mean) unnatural for a young man and a young woman to--to love one another. It is a thirst for love. It's their age, and they--they love one another. And it's not unnatural, that's just a natural thing for them to do that.\n\nL-74 Now we find many things, in the life that we live in the natural body, that we thirst for. It's just something sets in us. We want to do it, we absolutely feel that it's necessary. And it is necessary that we do it.\n\nL-75 We find many women, in these days, thirst for beauty. Now there isn't a woman... It's a natural thing for a woman to thirst to be pretty. That's--that's her God-given instinct and--and her beauty that God give her for her mate. And now we find out that women want to be that way. Why is it? It's just because it's something God gave her. And it's not wrong for women to be pretty. They should be.\n\nL-76 And, you know, they are the only creature that--that the female is prettier than the male, it's in the human race. Every other animal, take the--the cow to the bull, the doe deer to the buck, the hen to the rooster, the mother bird to the father bird, always you find the male is big and pretty. But on the human race, showed there is where the perversion come, it turns around; and it's the women so is--is pretty, and they lust to be pretty.\n\nL-77 Not like some of these weird creatures we see on the street of this day; no, no, not that kind of pretty. No. That's the horriblest-looking sight I ever seen in my life. Yes, sir. That is the perversion that's perverting the true thirst.\n\nL-78 Now, the true thirst that a woman should have, would be to \"adorn themselves in modest apparel, and to have a 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min Christlike spirit,\" I Timothy 2:9. Now that's a way the woman should thirst to be. Now if you want to be pretty, that's the way what makes you pretty, see, is a Christlike spirit, and adorned in modest apparel. [I Timothy 2:9]\n\nL-79 Oh, my, some of these people today out on the streets! You can't tell a man from the woman, and it's a--it's the most horrible-looking thing that you would... I wouldn't, it's--it's... I--I never seen anything like it, like human beings. It's beyond human. Eyes painted way up like that, and, you know, them funny-looking lizard eyes, and all them funny-looking clothes. And, why, it don't even... All so out of form, they don't even look like a human being. And some of them boys out here, with their hair combed down, their sister's, rollers in front here, you know, why, it's a complete perversion! That's right. It's--it's--it's Satan, and Satan is the perverter.\n\nL-80 When God made everything in the garden of Eden, it was lovely, then Satan come in and perverted. Satan cannot create nothing. There is only one Creator, that's God. But Satan perverts the original creation. And now he's got into (this I want to speak tonight about) perverting the--the original creation of thirst.\n\nL-81 Now, a woman, as I said before, wants to be pretty. There is something in her, that she is feminish and she wants to be that way.\n\nL-82 But the way they are on the street today, hair cut like a man, wearing man's clothes; and then man turn around, wearing women's clothes, and a haircut like a woman. See, it's a perversion, the whole thing! Your food is perverted. Your life is perverted. Your thirst, perverted. Your desire is perverted. It's a day of perversion!\n\nL-83 I was speaking here, not long ago, on Satan's Eden. God took six thousand years, and made a perfect Eden. Satan come over and sprayed them seeds, and deformed them. Now he's got six thousand years, and he has got his own scientific Eden, right back again on a perversion of the right.\n\nL-84 And this is the age of hybreeding, hybreeding. They even have got the--the churches today, till they're hybrid. That's right. They get in here, they just go to church, it's a lodge instead of a church. A church is a place where people come together and worship God in Spirit and in Truth. And today it's a lodge. We go there and have a little time to shake hands, and fellowship, and some black coffee in the back of the building, then go home till next week, and we done our religious duty.\n\nL-85 Now it's a perverted age. And Satan is perverting these thirsts that God put in you, to thirst. Satan is perverting them. Now if you want to know the right, perversion...\n\nL-86 If you, the women, wants to be pretty, take I Timothy 2:9, that's that \"adorning themselves in modest apparel--apparel, with a Christlike spirit, meek, subject to their husbands,\" and so forth. That's the way that you should be adorned, your life you live. [I Timothy 2:9]\n\nL-87 He perverts the true nature of God, and the true thirst of God, of the body and soul, by lust for sin. Sin, a perversion! Now we find out, a person today, the way they've took that perversion; thirst for God, the thirst for to be pretty, and all these thirsts. For, for water, they've turned that into satisfying that with drinking. The thirst for joy, everybody wants to have joy; thirst for fellowship; all these great thirsts that God put into us, that we might thirst after Him. God made you to thirst after Him, and we try to satisfy it with some other kind of a thirst, with some other kind of a perversion of the correct thirst. See how it's in the natural? See how it's in the spiritual? We think, as long as we join church, that--that settles, that's all we have to do. Well, that is absolutely wrong. No.\n\nL-88 God wants you to thirst for Him! \"As the hart panteth for the water brook, my soul thirsts after Thee, O God.\" See? See? [Psalms 42:1]\n\nL-89 Now, if that deer was panting for the water brook, what if somebody come along, and another buddy deer could come along, and say, \"Say, I'll tell you what I--I could do. I know where there is a mud hole down here.\" Well, the deer wouldn't want that. He, that wouldn't do him any good.\n\nL-90 And there is nothing can satisfy that thirst that's in the human being, until God comes in. He must have It, or die. And no persons has a right to try to hush or satisfy that holy thirst, that's in him, by the things of the world. No, sir. It's ungodly to do so. And if you thirst for God, don't shake hands with the preacher and put your name on the book. If 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min you're thirsting for God, there is only one thing to satisfy it, that's, meet God. If you're thirsting for God, that's the only way you can meet Him, is to do that.\n\nL-91 And then there is a great danger, also, if you don't watch what you're doing in that time. If you're thirsting for God, be sure it's God you find. See, be sure that it's your thirst is satisfied. But if Satan has been able to pervert you, from these natural appetites, and that he'll do if he can, he'll--he'll simply make you try to be satisfied.\n\nL-92 A man get out, what makes a man gets drunk? Is because he is worried and tore up. There is something lacking in him.\n\nL-93 I was at Mayo's, here not long ago, and I was up there on an interview. And then it was told in this, that, talking about drinking, and I told them that my father drank. Said, \"What made him drink? I said, \"I don't know.\"\n\nL-94 He said, \"Is because that there was something that (he) wasn't satisfying him, and he thought he could drink to throw it off his mind.\"\n\nL-95 I caught it right then, see. It was really God, was the only thing can satisfy that thirst. God Himself is the only thing can satisfy that human thirst, is to accept God.\n\nL-96 Now Satan takes these things, as I said, and perverts them. Then if you're--if you're... If you won't give that thirst the right place in your life, and won't thirst and take the things that God provided to stop that thirst with, to quench it, then Satan will lead you to some of his stagnant cesspools of this world. You must have it somewhere. If you can't find food, you'd eat from a garbage can. See? And if you--if you couldn't find water, and you was dying, you'd drink out of a--a pool of any kind, because you are perishing.\n\nL-97 But there is no reason for that, when you're thirsting for God, because God is a living God, not some historical something. \"My soul thirsts for Thee, the living God,\" Something that gives living waters, Something that satisfies. [Psalms 42:1-3]\n\nL-98 There is another nature, natural, just a natural thirst, in that thirst of the soul. You might say, \"Brother Branham, is that soul thirst, is that natural?\" Yes, that's natural for a soul to thirst. And it's, for God made you this way, that so that you would thirst for Him. He wants you to thirst after Him. Now, God made you like that. He didn't have to make you like that, but He did do it. And if He hadn't have made you like that, so that you would thirst, there would be an excuse at the Judgment Bar, say, \"I--I--I never did thirst for God.\" But, there is no excuse, you do. You will make it somewhat; you might make it your wife, you might make it your car, you might make it something else, you might go to church and try to satisfy it. And I have nothing against going to church, but that isn't the satisfaction. It's to find God, the living God, the God of Heaven, into your soul, that satisfies that longing and thirsting that you long for.\n\nL-99 Now, for, He made you so you could thirst for Him, for His fellowship. Now, there is genuine thirst for fellowship. Now we like to meet with one another. We're doing that tonight. We meet here together tonight because we like to fellowship, one with the other. Why do we do that? Because there is something in us that we want to meet one another. That's just natural. And now we meet on a common ground here, that is, because we are all thirsting for God. See? And then we meet here on this regular, common grounds here of fellowship. In the church tonight, here, might be many different denominational views, and so forth; but when it comes to that thirst, we can meet on a common ground, one ground: we all thirst. Some might believe in sprinkling, the other one in baptism, and one in pouring, or so forth; but when it comes to the thirst for God, we--we come on one mutual ground. And God made us so that we would do that, thirst for Him and for His fellowship. I don't know anything... [Acts 2:42], [Ephesians 3:9], [Philippians 3:10], [I John 1:3, 6, 7]\n\nL-100 When I was a little boy, I remember I was raised in a real poor family. And I remember of many times I would go out with fellows. I couldn't dress like to go out to a decent place. But, I--I don't know, there is something about people, that I liked. I liked to get with them. But I was, more or less, what is called, the black sheep. And when I got saved and found that Something in me, that I thirsted for, a--a Friend, Somebody that would be a buddy to me, Somebody I could 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min trust, Somebody you can set down to and talk your troubles over with. And when... I found that real true satisfaction when I found Jesus Christ, that real true Satisfier that takes away all--all.... quenches all that thirst, and gives you Something that--that just looks like that there is just nothing to take His place.\n\nL-101 And now how Satan tries to pervert this satisfying of the soul, that thirst for the soul! He tries to give you everything to satisfy it. And he is so deceitful in these days of perversion. This is a perverted world. It's a perverted race. It's a perverted people. Everything is perverted, and has perverted so gradual until it's become the most deceitful age that any human being ever lived in. It's more deceitful than it ever was.\n\nL-102 Now you just--you just can't imagine of how deceitful the nation's got, even with our own brethren, like American people.\n\nL-103 I was speaking sometime ago. I was in the woods a few weeks ago and found a--a--a cigarette pack laying in the woods. And it said on there, \"A thinking man's filter.\" And I went on down through the woods a little ways, and I come back; kept bearing on my mind, \"A thinking man's filter, and a smoking man's taste.\"\n\nL-104 Well, I was at the World Fair, couple years ago, remember they had that Yul Brynner and all them over there, when they was making demonstrations with cigarettes. And how they took that smoke and put it across a piece of marble, and took a Q-tip and raked up that nicotine off of there, and put it on the back of a rat. In seven days, he had so much cancer he couldn't get up on his feet. See, from one cigarette! And then they showed how that when that goes into the human lung. Some of them say, \"I don't inhale. I just puff it in my mouth.\" Shows how it gets in the saliva and goes right down just the same, into the throat, see.\n\nL-105 And then this man said, \"You see so much talk about a filter.\" He said, \"Now, if you have a desire,\" there is a thirst, you see, \"a desire to smoke a cigarette, one natural cigarette might satisfy that desire for the time being. But if you've got a filter, it takes four cigarettes to satisfy,\" said, \"because you're only getting about one fourth of the smoke.\"\n\nL-106 And said, \"A smoking man's taste\"? See, you cannot have smoke unless you get tar. And when you got tar, you got cancer. So there you are, see, it--it's just a gimmick. And I think of a--a tobacco company that's in this nation, and--and it lives by this nation, and then with a gimmick like that, to absolutely deceive American citizens, to deceive them. A thinking man's filter? It's only a gimmick to sell more cigarettes.\n\nL-107 Then I thought of that thing, \"A thinking man's Filter,\" I thought, \"that's a good idea.\" So there is a thinking man's Filter, that's this Bible. A--a thinking man's filter will take this Filter, It'll produce a righteous man's taste. See?\n\nL-108 Now, you cannot pull sin through the pages of this Bible. No, It stops it. It filters it out. Now, you can go to church, and just take anything, but you can't come through this Bible and have sin. It will not do it. It filters out all sin, and It gives a holy man's taste. Because if the man is thinking that he wants to be holy, and be like God, and be a son or a daughter of God, then he wants the right kind of a Filter. So He stops all sin on this side the Bible, and He can only bring the Holy Spirit through the Bible, that wrote the Bible. It's a holy man's taste, to have this thinking man's Filter.\n\nL-109 Now we find how deceiving it is today. Matthew 24:24, Jesus said, \"In the last days, that, the two spirits would be so close alike until they would deceive the very Elected if it was possible.\" How close! How, what a deception of--of right and wrong, we have today! [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-110 Even in our--in our government, in our politics, we--we haven't even got a man that we could put up as a politician, that will absolutely stand up for what he thinks is right. Where is our Patrick Henry's and George Washington's, and Abraham Lincoln's of today? Just as our President said there, \"The way, if they want communism, they can have it, whatever the people wants.\" If that ain't a--a man that won't speak his conviction! A man will stand on a principle, that will stand on what's what a principle... just want to go the--the--the way of least resistance.\n\nL-111 And that's the way that the people has got, in the church. They want to come join church, and they say, \"Oh, well, that--that's it, I--I've joined church now.\" You are trying to satisfy that great holy thirst that God put in you, that control Tower trying to turn you to the right thing, and you try to satisfy it with joining a church, quoting a creed, or something like that. When, it's nothing but the very Presence and filling of God Himself in your life, that will satisfy that. 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min\n\nL-112 He won't be satisfied with a creed. You will never pull a creed through that Bible. No. There is not even the Apostles' Creed, so called, will never come through There. Show me in the Bible where the Apostles' Creed says, \"I believe in the Holy Roman Catholic church; I believe in the communion of saints\"; when the Bible said, \"There is one mediator between God and man, and that's the Man Christ Jesus.\" You will never pull that through the Bible. [I Timothy 2:5]\n\nL-113 You will never pull all these dances, and shorts, and things that the people are doing today, these twists and watusi's, and all these things, through God's Word. You'll never pull this modern trend of civilization through that Bible. It's against it. See? And you try to satisfy that thirst, but, you see, it'll... This Bible will only satisfy a righteous man or woman's taste. This Holy Spirit, that they would laugh at, and said, \"You've gone out of your mind.\" But That satisfies that longing, that something that the world knows nothing about. They have perverted themselves, from true baptism of the Holy Spirit and the Word of God, (unto what?) unto the cesspools, the cesspools of the church, of dogmas and creeds, and--and denominational differences, and so forth. Say, \"You a Christian?\"\n\nL-114 \"I'm Methodist. I'm Baptist. I'm Presbyterian.\" That don't mean one thing to God, not one thing. You can't pull them things through God's Bible here. And you're trying to satisfy that holy thirst that God give you, to thirst after Him. Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-115 Now, you know that David said here, \"for the living God.\" Now, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\" Then there can be no satisfaction until this Word, which is God, becomes alive in you, then you see God Himself fulfilling the promises that He made in the Bible. [John 1:1, 14], [Psalms 42:1-2]\n\nL-116 Now we have different interpreters of the Bible. One church interprets It this way, another one interprets It that way, and another one this way. Some don't take but a little bit of It; some take here and there, a piece of It. But God is His Own interpreter. When He makes a promise and fulfills it, that's the interpretation thereof.\n\nL-117 If I promised you I would be here tonight, and here I am, that's the fulfilling of my promise. If I say I'll meet you in the morning, and I'm there, that's my promise. There ain't no need of making any other excuses, I've got to be there.\n\nL-118 And when God makes a promise, and then comes around and fulfills that promise, that's the interpretation of the promise. And I would dare anybody to take God at His Word, and see if every Word in that Bible isn't the Truth. That's right. That's what that thirst is in there.\n\nL-119 You say, \"If I would have lived in the days of Jesus, I would have done so-and-so.\"\n\nL-120 Why, you are living in His days. What are we doing about it? What are we doing? You say, \"Well?\" What you done, perhaps what the Pharisees done. They belonged to church, and denied Jesus Christ.\n\nL-121 We always say today, people try to say, \"We compare. We've got to compare Bible leaf with Bible leaf, Scripture with Scripture.\" That isn't the Truth. No, it isn't the Truth. \"This Greek word means this, and this means that.\" The Greeks themself, way back in the Nicaea Council, and them writers back in there, they had different forms. One believed this way, this Greek scholar meant this, and the other one said this one meant it this way. And they fussed over It. We don't need interpretation of Greek scholars or Greek words.\n\nL-122 \"To know Him is Life,\" the Person, Christ Himself! Not comparing. It's a revelation that God built His Church upon. And if we don't build upon that same Church... The Bible said, \"Abel, by faith!\" And faith is a Divine revelation. See, faith is a Divine revelation. All right. This whole Thing is built upon the revelation then, and unless this is revealed to you! Jesus said, \"I thank Thee, Father, that Thou has hid these things from the wise of this world, and revealed it to babes such as will learn.\" See, now, the whole thing is built there, you've got to know the Person! [Luke 10:21], [Hebrews 11:4]\n\nL-123 And you cannot satisfy that by joining church. You've got to find the Person, God Himself, which is the Word and--and interpretation of Hisself today, the promises that He made today. The people that He was going to have in this 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min day, \"the Church without spot or wrinkle,\" don't mean a denomination; it means the persons, the individuals without spot or wrinkle. \"Be two in the bed, I'll take one and leave one; two in the field, I'll take one and leave one.\" But when God, that holy thirst to be like Him, and then you see that His Word is in you, vindicating Itself, that you are God's servant. Whatever God says, you just toe right up to it, then you're coming through the right process then to satisfy that holy thirst that's in you. [Luke 17:34], [Ephesians 5:27]\n\nL-124 Oh, of course, the people will laugh at you, and say, \"You've lost your mind. You've gone crazy.\" But remember what they're drinking from, see. Look where they are at. Could you imagine a big artesian well spurting up fine water, and somebody down at one of them holes down there, with dead tadpoles, and creeds and everything laying in it, drinking down there, looking up and making fun of you? Oh! Why, he doesn't know, he doesn't know what a--what a thirst-quenching Stream you're living at. That's exactly right.\n\nL-125 We got a living God. Not one that died nineteen hundred years ago and stayed in the grave, but One that raised again. Hebrews 13:8, says, \"He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" The same Holy Ghost that fell on the Day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's here now. He is the satisfying Portion, because He is the Word. That's right. The Holy Ghost wrote the Word, He interprets the Word. The Bible said, in II Peter, that the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible, \"Man of old, moved by the Holy Ghost, wrote the Bible.\" [Hebrews 13:8], [II Peter 1:21]\n\nL-126 Now, you can't do it, you can't satisfy that holy thirst with nothing less than God Himself living in you, in the Person of the Holy Spirit. Education, culture, joining churches, reciting creeds, going to belong in a fellowship; all these things are very good, but they absolutely will not stop that holy hush, that--that holy thirst, rather, won't hush that holy thirst.\n\nL-127 I was listening to Billy Graham, the great evangelist, the other night. And I tell you, I pray more for him now than I ever did, when I seen him really rapping it to them, the way they did. He said, \"That bunch of clergymen coming down the road, them collars turned around!\" Going down there where they had no business to go, sticking their nose in something. But they was going down the road, [Brother Branham claps his hands--Ed.] clapping their hands and patting their foot. Well, they looked like unholy-rollers. Now, you see, but they got something they--they believe in. They got something, it excites the soul. They got something they was excited about. Some woman went and stuck her head in something down there, and they thought she was a martyr, and she had no business to be into. Now we find that these men [Brother Branham claps his hands] had something they could clap their hands about. They were happy. They were doing something.\n\nL-128 Well, if you can do that for a--a principle that you think is right here; and then stand in a church and somebody clap their hands or pat their foot, the deacons would lead them out the door. See, they have turned their people to a filthy cesspool of creed and denomination, instead of feeding them on the blessed holy Word of God, that's delivered by the Power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nL-129 See, they try to, they quench their thirst by saying, \"I am Doctor So-and-so,\" or come out of a certain seminary or a certain school. But that don't mean one thing, not a thing. But, you see, they, they try to satisfy themselves, say, \"Now God will recognize me because I am His pastor. God will recognize me because I am holy Father So-and-so, or Bishop, So-and-so,\" or--or something like that. They are trying to satisfy their thirst there, when you can't do it. \"I got a Ph.D., LL.D. I got my Bachelor of Art. I got this.\" That's all right. But, to me, that just means you're that much farther away from God. That's right. That much further away from God, all the time!\n\nL-130 You only know God by an experience. You cannot educate This into you. It's borned into you! It's something that God gives you. Education has nothing to do with It. One of the greatest men in the Bible couldn't even sign his name, Saint Peter. That's exactly right, him and John, the Bible said, \"They were both ignorant and unlearned.\" But it pleased Jesus to give him the keys to the Kingdom, because he was thirsting for God. Amen. Thirsting for God, fellowship. Yes, sir. Oh, my! [Acts 4:13]\n\nL-131 I think of Isaiah, that young man, oh, a fine young man, he was down there in the temple, one day.\n\nL-132 The great king, and he put his face towards him and thought he was one of the greatest men. Which, he was a 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min great man. He was raised up, fine parents, a good mother and dad. But when he went out, his politics was clean, and he made things right with God. And Isaiah looked at him and thought he was a great man, put him for an example. But don't you (never) put no man, but the Man Christ Jesus, for your example. All man will fail. After a while, he got to a place; he was--he was king, but he tried to take a priest's place and went into the temple, and he was stricken with leprosy. [II Chronicles 26:16-21]\n\nL-133 Then Isaiah was all worried, so he goes down to the temple and he begin to--to pray, he thought he would go down and pray a while. And now, look, that man was a prophet; but down there in the temple was a young man, he was crying out to God, one day, and a vision fell before him. And when he did, he seen Angels, Cherubims, with Their faces covered with Their--with Their wings, and Their feet covered, and flying with two wings. And They were going back and forth, up-and-down through the temple, crying, \"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.\" [Isaiah 6:1-3]\n\nL-134 And Isaiah, that great thirst that he had had, he--he perhaps was schooled. He--he probably had a good education. He had a--a marvelous conception of what God ought to be. He--he had heard the priests. He had been in the temple. He had been raised to be a--a believer, but, you see, he had never come face to face with It before. See? He--he had a desire to do right. He wanted to be right, but he just had the educational side. He had the theological side of It.\n\nL-135 But when he got there in the temple that day, and he seen these Cherubims waving these wings back and forth, and realized that these Angels ministered in the face of God. And them Angels didn't even know what sin was, and, to stand in the Presence of God, They had to cover Their holy faces, to stand in the Presence of God. Then that prophet cried out, \"Woe is me, for I am a man of unclean lips. All of my theology, theology and stuff that I've learned, all of my marvelous conception that I had of God, I am face to face with it now.\" He said, \"I'm a man of unclean lips, and I dwell with people that's unclean lips.\" All their teaching of the laws, and things they had done, had never reached that place to where he come into the Presence of God, and seen God with his own eyes; and His trail, when He was sitting up on High, in the Heavens. And there he was, face to face with reality. And he cried, \"I'm a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among unclean people.\" [Isaiah 6:5]\n\nL-136 And then it was that the Cherubim took the tongs, and a coal of Fire from the altar, and touched them unclean lips. And turned him from a coward, or from an educated man, a teacher, to a prophet that the Word of God could speak through. Sure, while he was in the Presence of God, It was something different. That thirst that he had had, had reached that place then, till he was filled with It. [Isaiah 6:6-7]\n\nL-137 And let me tell you, friend, I don't care how many churches you join, how many names you put on, which a way you go, and whether you are sprinkled, baptized, or whatever you are; until you meet that Person, Jesus Christ! That, that's the only thing that will really satisfy.\n\nL-138 Emotion won't do it; you might jump up-and-down and shout as long as you want to, or you might run up-and-down the floor, and you might speak in tongues as much as you want to. And them things are holy and good. I don't say--I don't say nothing against that. But until you meet that Person, that satisfying Portion, that Something that takes every fiber in your body; not by emotion, but by a satisfaction!\n\nL-139 I used to see a little sign, said, \"If you're thirsty, say Parfay.\" There used to be a little drink, when I was a boy, called Parfay. I remember coming down the road, oh, from fishing, I had been up to the pond, old stagnant waters. And I was about starved to death, and I seen a sign say, \"If you're thirsty, just say Parfay.\" And I started saying, \"Parfay, Parfay.\" I got thirstier all the time. And I--I... See, I--I--I got so I couldn't even spit, after a while, I was so--so thirsty.\n\nL-140 Well, you see, that won't do it. There is nothing will satisfy it. I don't care, you can drink cokes, you can drink anything you want to, with them sweetened by carbonated waters, and so forth, there is nothing that will satisfy the thirst like a good cool, cold stream of water. That'll quench that thirst. All these other things are substitutes.\n\nL-141 And why would we want to take a substitute, when there is a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost that satisfies every fiber and longing in the human soul? Then stand right in the face of death, like the great Apostle Paul said, \"O death, where is your sting? And, grave, where is your victory? But thanks be to God, Who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!\"That's the experience, brother, that satisfies that holy hush that... or that holy thirst that's in you. 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min It satisfies it. You don't have to do anything else about it. Yeah, It cleanses the lips. [I Corinthians 15:55]\n\nL-142 And there also, just people who live upon the emotion, upon the... Some people say, \"Well, we got a lot of that in our Pentecostal movement.\" And they will go in, which is fine, they'll pat their hands [Brother Branham claps his hands--Ed.] and play the music. The music stops, \"sh, whew,\" a bucket of water went over everything, see. Now we--we do that, we--we got in a habit of doing that. We got, we--we... It's just become one of our customs.\n\nL-143 Let me tell you something. When you're worshiping God, in the Spirit and in Truth, when it becomes a custom for you to do it, because you think you ought to do it; because you think, if you don't shout, or jump up-and-down, or dance with the music, your neighbor is going to think you're backslid; you are drinking from a stagnated stream. Right!\n\nL-144 Until It fills every fiber, until the Holy Spirit Itself bubbling in you; I don't care whether the music is playing, whether they're playing Nearer, My God, To Thee, or whatever it is, the Holy Spirit is still ringing the glory bells in your heart. That satisfies. That's God's satisfying Portion. Anything less that That, you're done.\n\nL-145 You might speak with tongue like men and Angels, you might give all your goods to feed the poor, you might prophesy, and you might have knowledge, understand all the mysteries and all these things, and you still become nothing (I Corinthians 13) until that satisfying Something that can only quench that thirst. [I Corinthians 13:1-5]\n\nL-146 \"My soul thirsts for the living God, like the hart panting for the water brook. Unless I can find It, I'll perish.\" When you get to hungering for God like that, something is going to take place. The Holy Spirit is to lead you to those great fountains of God. Yes, sir. [Psalms 42:1]\n\nL-147 Now, there is a good thing, to worship in the Spirit. That's true. But sometimes you have Spirit without Truth. St. John 4, said, \"We worship God, Spirit and Truth.\" And Jesus is the Truth. That's exactly right. And He is the Word. [John 4:23-24]\n\nL-148 The streams God sent to satisfy you, in the natural, Satan has polluted every one of them. He has put the poisoned dope in every one that he could get into. That's right. He took that great stream, of the church.\n\nL-149 That, that was God's way. Jesus said, \"Upon this Rock I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell can't prevail against It.\" [Matthew 16:18]\n\nL-150 Now there is different arguments of that. The Roman people, the Catholic says, \"He built It upon Peter.\" See, and if that be so, Peter backslid, in a few days. So, It wasn't. It sure wasn't built upon Peter, Petra, the little rock. And then the Protestant says, that, \"He built It upon Himself, Jesus Christ.\" Not to be different, but I differ with them. He never built It on either one.\n\nL-151 He built It upon the revelation of Who He was. He said, \"Blessed art thou, Simon, son of Jonas, flesh and blood never revealed this to you, but My Father which is in Heaven has revealed this to you.\" Not by knowledge! You didn't learn It by books. You didn't learn It by joining church. You didn't learn It in the shouts. You did... But the Holy Ghost Itself has brought the Person of Jesus Christ to you, then, \"Upon this Rock I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell can't prevail against It.\" That holy thirst has been satisfied in the Person of Jesus Christ. There you are. That's the thing that we want to look for, satisfy that thirst with That. All right, we find that we must. [Matthew 16:17-18]\n\nL-152 Knowledge? Oh, my! Knowledge is a great thing, we fill up, and today we're full of it. But you see, knowledge... as I was saying the other day, speaking on that subject of knowledge. There was a man standing outside, was talking to a friend of mine standing there, said, \"If a man don't believe in education, why is he reading the Bible?\" They...\n\nL-153 I thought, \"Well, if they didn't get what the Lord Jesus said, how are they going to get a dummy like me, what I say?\" They couldn't even understand Him, as plain as He was.\n\nL-154 He said there one day, \"Except you eat the body, the Blood, drink the Blood and eat the body of the Son of man, you have no Life in you.\" He didn't explain It. He walked on. That's right. See? [John 6:53]\n\nL-155 \"Well,\" they said, \"this Man is a cannibal. We want Him... to eat His body, drink His Blood. He is a vampire. See, He wants us to become a vampire.\" See? Them intellectuals!\n\nL-156 But He said, \"My sheep hear My Voice.\" See, It would come to the Elected, God had elected by foreknowledge. 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min \"And those who the Father... No man can come to Me except the Father draws him. And all the Father has given Me, they will come, they'll understand It.\" [John 10:27]\n\nL-157 Them disciples couldn't understand It, but they believed It. See? That's right. If you believe It! I can't understand many things. I believe It, anyhow, see, because God said It was so.\n\nL-158 Knowledge. You know, Satan's gospel is knowledge. Did you know that? He preached it in the garden of Eden, to Eve, and she was deceived by his knowledge gospel. Now, and has polluted the whole human race, with it. That's exactly right. They've took educational programs, put them in the church. They're all right out there, but not in Gold's Word. No, sir. You don't know God by education. You don't know God by--by--by knowing how, learning mathematics and pronouncing big words. [Genesis 2:15-17], [Genesis 3:1-8]\n\nL-159 Paul, he was a smart man. But when he come to Christ, and received the Holy Spirit, went to the Corinthians, he said, \"I never come to you with enticing words of man's wisdom,\" though he could have done it. Said, \"I come to you in power and manifestations of the Holy Ghost, that your faith would be in God, not in the wisdom of some man.\" [I Corinthians 2:4]\n\nL-160 Now sometimes we make the church programs, they also call for their--their pastor. The church goes to vote the pastor, they say, \"Well, this pastor, now, he has got two degrees in college. He learned four years of psychology. He took this, that, the other.\" And they'll vote that kind of a man in (why?) instead of a pastor who believes in God's Word being inspired and being God, and will preach the Word regardless of how people feel about It.\n\nL-161 God told Ezekiel, you know, said, \"Preach that whether they believe It or not. You preach It, anyhow.\" See? Right. Whether they accept It, or not, that ain't it. They didn't accept Jesus. He went right on, preaching It just the same. See? [Ezekiel 2:4-5]\n\nL-162 Instead of a real pastor that will really preach the Word and believe in God, they--they--they try to bring in the--the intellect, the man who has got the best education; the man who can stand in the pulpit and don't take but just about fifteen minutes, so they can get home right quick, and go (some) do something else, and Ricky can get his hot rod and start out, and they can go to the twist parties and everything. And it's, oh, it's--it's just it's--it's nothing else but a hybrid educational pollution. That's right. That's just exactly what it is. That's right. But what is it? It satisfies their taste, see, it satisfies a worldly church member's taste. It don't satisfy a saint's taste. He'll take the Word every time!\n\nL-163 But they say, \"Oh, well, now them people is just a little off at their mind. See, they just don't, they don't get it. They, they're trying to live in a day gone by.\n\nL-164 Isn't it strange! I come out here in the West, and I find out they're all trying to live in a day gone by, they always want some of the old-fashion cowboy days. And go down in Kentucky, the old-fashion hillbilly days, they want to act like it, have programs of it. But when it comes to old-fashion Religion, they don't want nothing about It.\n\nL-165 Old-fashion days? I come down here in the rodeo time, I seen they had a big woman down there, that green stuff under her eyes, and short bobbed hair, a cigarette in her mouth. Why, if they'd have seen that back in the old days, they'd have thought she was cankered somewhere. They, they'd--they'd--they'd have put her in. What if your mother would have walked out, dressed like you and your daughter dress today, what would taken place? They'd a-had her in the insane institution. Sure, she come out without her skirt on. Well, now remember, it's the same thing today.\n\nL-166 Man is rottening in their flesh. If they're going through the middle age, between twenty and twenty-five years old, their brain cells are rottening too. They haven't got... People has got so they haven't got enough understanding. They don't know what decency means. They don't know the difference between right and wrong. And, oh, though, their educational program, they...\n\nL-167 Did you know, education, I can prove it to you, is of the Devil? Not to read and write; but, I mean, putting their education in your church.\n\nL-168 What does communism lay on? Science, education, that's their god. Satan, see, that's what he introduced to Eve. 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min That's what they're still holding to.\n\nL-169 Now it's got over in our churches, got over in the Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterian, Pentecostals, and all. Some education, intellectual, some great so-and-so and something like that, that just throws him farther away from God. It's wrong. Yes, sir. Now, we find out, that (they) it satisfies their desire. When a--when a--a church would vote-in something like that, it goes to show what's in that church's mind, what their desire is, what their thirsting is for. They want to say, \"Our pastor is wide minded. He don't mind us mix-bathing, and he goes with us.\"\n\nL-170 A little girl told my Sarah, the other day. Her pastor had been to Africa; and when he come back, she stripped off her clothes, that night, with a pair of little tights on, and done the watusi for him, to entertain him because he had been to Africa. The Watusi is a tribe over there, you know. Boy, I'd like to see one of my girls, in my congregation, try to do something like that, watusi?\n\nL-171 See, it goes to show! And a pastor would sit and look at one of his congregation, a little (sixteen or eighteen years old) girl out there stripped off like that, and let her get by with that, that shows that he come out of a cesspool, himself, a man of God do a thing like that. Certainly.\n\nL-172 That sounds flat, but I realize I'm preaching across the nation, too. But you know this also, brother, sister, let me tell you, that's the Truth.\n\nL-173 A vulture wants dead things. That's right. And that's dead! That's exactly right. Plainly shows, it just plainly show here what is their head and their control tower, what it's giving them, see, what's in their soul. Their soul longeth for things like that.\n\nL-174 Their soul longeth for a high intellectual church, where the people dress real fine, and the pastor takes fifteen minutes, or twenty. And if you go over that, they drawed him back on the deacon board. And he mustn't say nothing about sin. He mustn't say anything about wearing shorts, and wouldn't say nothing about people doing this, that, or the other. He mustn't mention that at all. If they do, the board will have him throwed out. See what it is? That's their thinking man's filter.\n\nL-175 The Bible said, in First John 2:15, \"If you love this world system, or the things of this world, it's because that the love of God is not even in you.\" [I John 2:15]\n\nL-176 Now what about all this carrying on they done today, in the name of the church; practicing square dancing in the church, bunco, bingo, parties, teenagers rock-and-roll, twists, all these stuff! Look at this Elvis Presley, a devil standing in shoes! Pat Boone, Ricky Nelson, the biggest impediment this nation has ever had! That's right. They say, \"Oh, they are very religious, they sang Christian songs.\" It oughtn't to, the church oughtn't to even permit a thing like that! Some of these guys go out here, and--and tonight they're in a--a roadhouse out here, dancing and playing music and everything, and the next night they come to the altar and weep, and the next night they're playing music on the platform. Oh, goodness, gracious! How far can filth, how far could filth go, anyhow? Yes, sir. Prove himself first to be a man of God, not all this stuff just because he can beat an old guitar or something.\n\nL-177 By your desire, you can tell who is on the throne of your heart. By what you love, that's what tells. You, you say, \"Well, I think them things are all right, Brother Branham.\" Well, just remember now, in your heart, you know what's there. Yes, sir. By what is feeding your soul, what your soul is thirsting for, and you can see it satisfies that; if it isn't this Word, then there is something wrong, because the Holy Spirit lives on the Word only. See? [Psalms 42:1-2]\n\nL-178 I want you to see another great danger, just before we close, if you are not--if you're not guilty of any of these things that I've mentioned, and, that is, the danger of neglecting a thirst. See? You say, \"I have a holy thirst. But I--I'm not guilty, Brother Branham, of just go and joining church, and things like this.\" But, see, to neglect a thirst! If you neglect to satisfy a thirst of water or food, you will die. And if you neglect that thirst in you, for God, you will spiritually die.\n\nL-179 You call for revivals, you wait for your church to have a revival. Well, that ain't--that ain't the revival for you. The revival ought to begin right in you, when you begin to thirst for God. There might not be another member, of the church, wanting that revival. If it breaks out in you, it will break out other places. See? But, see, you neglect that thirst. 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min\n\nL-180 You neglect to milk the cow, when the cow is... the udder is full of milk; and if you let that cow stay like that, she'll go dry. That's exactly right. If you neglect to take a drink of water, say, \"I just ain't going to drink anymore,\" you'll die. You neglect to eat food, you'll die.\n\nL-181 So if you neglect to give the Holy Spirit the Word of God, you'll die.\n\nL-182 You Christians, you Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Pentecostals, Assemblies of God, Oneness, Twoness, Threeness, whatever you are, see; don't care, that don't matter nothing to me, I don't think it does to God. See, you're an individual, you're a unit. You'll never go to Heaven as a church, a--a--a denomination. You'll go to Heaven as one single person, between you and God. That's all. I don't care what church you belong to.\n\nL-183 And if you neglect to read the Bible and to believe the Bible, and the Holy Spirit to feed upon That, you will die. Jesus said in St. John 4:3; the Scripture I got right... Jesus said that, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word,\" not just part of It. [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-184 We take a little, bit here. I call that a Bible hitchhiker. They say, \"Well, I believe This, but now let's go over here, see.\" See?\n\nL-185 You've got to take It, Word by Word. Jesus said, \"Man shall live by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" Did you know that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] [Matthew 4:4]\n\nL-186 And, you know, we've made--we've made the day that we're living in, we--we made this day the... a--a--a religious perversion.\n\nL-187 My daughter called me in, not long ago, and said to me, \"Daddy,\" in the next side of the house, she said, \"come over here, we're going to have a religious program on.\" It was a singing, hymn singing, and there was some little Ricky reading it up there. And if I ever seen a sacrilegious movement, it was that! Them guys up there, and people, looked more like it was a floorshow. Supposed to be an Indian tribe, and they were carrying on, and--and jump up and box at one another.\n\nL-188 Where, what's went with the sincerity, where is those old-fashion hymns we used to sing, and rejoice in the Spirit of God, and tears roll down our cheeks? And now we try to hold our breath until we ain't got enough breath in us, till our face turns blue, to try to show that we are some sort of a singer. See, we've copied that off of Hollywood, and all these programs that we see through this intellectual hymn sing and training of voice. I--I like to hear good singing; I like to hear good old-fashion, heartfelt, pentecostal singing. But I sure hate to hear that squeaking they call singing, today. That's right. I think that's the most ridiculous thing. It's a perversion. That's right.\n\nL-189 I like to see a man when he's a man. I hate to see one with his wife's underclothes on out here, and slipped up along the side; and--and a roller hanging down here in front, and two cones of hair hanging down like bangs, cut in front. That, I--I couldn't call that a man. He don't know what side of the race he belongs on. See? That's right. You see the woman, look, the woman is trying to cut her, make her hair like the man; the man is trying to make his hair, bangs, like the woman. The man is wearing his wife's underneath clothes; she is wearing his overalls. See, just a perversion, right around.\n\nL-190 And that's the same thing it is with nation, with people, with churches, with everything. O God! Where is the end of the thing? The Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, that's the end of it.\n\nL-191 So, if you neglect to feed the Holy Spirit the Word of God! Jesus said, \"Every Word shall be by the Holy Spirit.\" And listen now. If you try to feed It the wrong thing, if It's the genuine Holy Spirit in you, It'll know the difference. Now, remember, the Word of God is what the Holy Spirit feeds on. It don't feed on enthusiasm. It don't feed on education. It doesn't feed on churchgoing. It doesn't feed on theologies. There is a lot of difference between an inspired something and a theological standpoint of it. [Matthew 4:4], [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-192 All those theologians in the days of Jesus, my, they had word by word, page by page, all laid out, the Messiah had to come this way! That's exactly what it was. And they, every one, missed it. You know what Jesus said when He come, said, \"You are of your father the Devil, and his works you'll do.\" [John 8:44] 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min\n\nL-193 It wasn't revealed to them what the real Word was. See, they missed those little corners, like they're missing today. \"If you'll belong to this and belong to this, you'll be all right.\" Don't you believe that. You've got to belong to Christ. And if there is Something in you, hungering for Christ!\n\nL-194 Just remember, when you were in your father's loins, you were with him then. But your father didn't know you then, and you didn't know your father. And you had to come and be born. God made a way through your mother, for the--the seedbed, and then it come. And then you become a man or a woman, whatever it was, then you recognized your father, and your father could have fellowship with you.\n\nL-195 Now, remember, if you've got Eternal Life, your Life was in God at the beginning. And, the Life, God is the Word. And then when the Word was made flesh in Jesus Christ, God coming down to dwell in His Own body, made Himself the Son of God. When God came down to dwell in that, you were in Him when He was crucified. And you were crucified with Him, and you died with Him on Calvary. You was buried with Him, on the mountain. And you rose with Him, on Easter morning. And now you're setting together in Heavenly places, in Him, and now you've got fellowship with Him. See? [John 1:1, 14]\n\nL-196 God Himself become one of us. \"No man has seen the Father, any time, the only Begotten of the (Son) Father has declared Him.\" That's, God became a man, so He could fellowship you as a man. See? And now you are--you are flesh, and He is flesh. God is made flesh among us, in the Person of His Son, Jesus Christ. And in Him was God. He was God, nothing short of God. He was God. \"God manifested in the Son, Jesus Christ,\" which made Him Emmanuel, as the prophet said He would be. [John 6:46], [John 1:14]\n\nL-197 Now see, then, you had to be before the world was ever formed, your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life. And then what can you eat? The Holy Spirit lives by the Word of God. And now in Revelation 22:19, the Bible said, \"Whosoever shall take one Word out of This, or add one word to It, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.\" See how deep it is? You cannot, the Holy Spirit won't live on the things of the world. [Revelation 22:18-19]\n\nL-198 Like a dove bird and a crow. A crow is a big hypocrite. A crow, that fellow can go out here and can eat wheat all day long; and go over there and fly on it, an old dead carcass, and eat it too. He can sit in the field and he can eat with the dove, wheat, and go over and eat on the dead carcass.\n\nL-199 But the dove can eat wheat all day long, but it can't eat on a dead carcass, because it's a dove. And a dove don't have any gall. One bite out of that dead carcass, it'd kill the dove. See, it has no gall. And that's the way it is, no bitterness.\n\nL-200 And that's the way with a real, genuine Christian. They don't want the things of the world. They just eat the Word of God, and That alone; what's clean, the thinking man's Filter. See, they come through That, and That alone. The dead things of the world, it stinks to them. [I John 2:15]\n\nL-201 Look at the old crow in the days of the antediluvian destruction, flying from body to body, eating them old dead carcasses, he didn't come back to the ark. But the dove could find no rest for her feet, see, she come back to the ark where she was getting grain. And that's the way we do, we live by the Word of God. [Genesis 8:5-12]\n\nL-202 In Psalms 42. David must have wrote this Psalm, Psalms 42, when he was a fugitive, when he said, \"My soul thirsts after Thee, as a hart panteth after the water brook.\" Look, he cried. David was a fugitive. He had been... He had the anointing oil on him, he knowed he was going to be king. The prophet had anointed him king. Now notice, and there he was, he had a little bunch of soldiers, made up of Gentiles, and so forth, was up on top of the mountain. Where, his own beloved city, because of their sin, they were garrisoned all around with the Philistines. And David, on that hot day, it must have been when he wrote this Psalm, \"As the hart panteth for the water brook.\" [Psalms 42:2], [II Samuel 23:12-17]\n\nL-203 Notice David in this condition. He looked down, he looked at his beloved city. And he remembered when he was a little boy, he used to take the sheep out by this certain pool there. It was a great, great water country, and also bread country, down there. Really, Bethlehem, means \"the house of God's Bread.\" And then when David remembered going by there and drinking that good cool water, and here he was laying up here now, a fugitive, away from his own people. 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min He had no place to go, and his soul must have cried for that good cool water. [II Samuel 23:14-15]\n\nL-204 He had some servants there that, my, just the least of his desire was a command. And they, three of them, fought their way through that line of Philistines; fifteen miles, seven miles, or something, down and back; cutting their way through, and brought him a drink of that water. But the soul thirst... [II Samuel 23:16]\n\nL-205 His body, he was up there, probably had to drink out of anything he could get a hold of, some old goat skins and things, with some old hot water in, on that hot day. He thought, \"If I could just lay down and quench this thirst that I have! If I could just go down there to Bethlehem and lay down by that spring, and drink!\" [II Samuel 23:14-15]\n\nL-206 And when they went down and got the water, and brought it back, his soul thirst was so greater, not for Bethlehem, but from Jerusalem; his soul was. So he sacrificed the water, said, \"I wouldn't even drink it.\" He poured it out upon the ground. See, his soul was more thirsty for God, than it was to satisfy the quench of a good... his thirst of his body, with a good cool water. He poured it upon the ground. [II Samuel 23:16-17]\n\nL-207 See, the House of God, the soul-cooling waters of Jerusalem, which is above! Jesus said, in John 6:33, \"I am the, Bread of Life. I am the Bread of Life.\" Bethlehem, \"house of God,\" our church, earthly church of God, the church that's here on earth. We love to go to the church here on earth, but greater is Jerusalem, which is above, which is God. Jerusalem above, which is God! Greater is that soul's thirst, to be there with Him, than it would to be just to satisfy yourself with joining a church somewhere. See, joining a church don't satisfy that thirst. David proved it here, the waters right from the house of God, see, he poured it out upon the ground; to find favor, to get a good cool drink from God. Even on that... Greater than the thirst that's in you, is that thirst of the soul-thirst for God. [John 6:33]\n\nL-208 Notice Jerusalem, the word. \"Jerusalem is from above,\" the Bible said, \"which we're... is the Mother of us all.\" And Christ is our Mother. We realize that God is our Mother, for we are born of Him. The word simply means \"peace,\" Jerusalem, Shalom. Or, Shalom, which means \"peace,\" Jeru-shalom, see, means \"peace.\" [Galatians 4:26]\n\nL-209 Greater should be the thirst of any soul, for the waters of Life, than to say you belong to a church; the thirst of the soul can't be satisfied, the real true thirst. It can be perverted. You can think you are all right when you join church, but that isn't It. That won't satisfy the genuine holy thirst for God. It just simply won't do it. It just... It's just not there.\n\nL-210 Now David said, in Psalms 42:7 here, \"When the deep calleth unto the Deep, at the noise of Thy waterspout,\" the soul's call. [Psalms 42:7]\n\nL-211 Look, I've often used this as an illustration. If there is a fin on a fish's back, it had to be put there for him to swim with. He has a need for that. Now what if he'd say, \"I'm going to be a different fish. I'm going to be a smart, educated fish. Uh-huh, I--I'll just... I'm going to believe some real theology! I believe I don't have to have that fin\"? He wouldn't get very far in the water, would he? And that's exactly right. [Psalms 42:7]\n\nL-212 What if a tree said, \"Now, I know there had to be an earth first, for me to grow in. That's right. I'm supposed to grow here. But I'm going to be a different tree, I want them just set me out here in the middle of the street, so I can be noticed\"? See, he wouldn't live very long. See? That's right.\n\nL-213 \"When the deep calleth to the Deep.\" It takes more than joining a church. It takes more than shaking hands with the preacher. It takes more than living a good, straight life. It takes something to satisfy inside of you, that pours down from God, into the soul. \"The deep calling to the Deep, at the noise of Thy waterspouts, O Lord. The deep calling to the Deep!\" [Psalms 42:7]\n\nL-214 What kind of a thirst could we think was in us tonight? We, as Pentecostal people, where are we getting to? What kind of a thirst is in us? What kind of a thirst is in me? What kind of thirst is in you? Don't try to hush that holy thirst for God.\n\nL-215 Years ago, when they used to have gold out here in the mountains. I read a story, many years ago, it's always stuck with me. It said there was a--a prospector went out here somewhere beyond the mountains here, and was prospecting for gold, and he struck a rich claim. And he come back, thinking; when he got to the city, what he would be, his troubles was all over. And--and he--he tried to--to say, \"Tomorrow I'll get in and I'll...\" Just one day's journey, 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min he would be into the city, and he would have the gold. And he had big sacks full of it.\n\nL-216 He had a dog with him. Not comparing now the dog to the Holy Spirit, but as I'm making an illustration. But this dog...\n\nL-217 Through the night, the prospector laid upon his bed, and--and he begin to think, \"Now, tomorrow I'll--I'll take all my gold in, and I'll become just what I've always wanted to be. I--I--I always wanted to be a rich man. I--I wanted to own fine things, and so forth.\"\n\nL-218 And--and then this dog begin to bark, and because there was an enemy approaching. And he--he went out there, and he said, \"Shut up!\" And so the dog quieted down. And no more than got back in bed, he started like he was going to go to sleep, and the dog started again, just jumping at the chain. And he went to the door again, said, \"Shut up! I want you to know that tomorrow I'm a rich man, see,\" and that was his great dreams. But the dog started barking again.\n\nL-219 And finally, he got so discouraged, he went and got his shotgun and shot the dog, and killed it. He said, \"I won't have no more use for you, anyhow. Tomorrow I'm a rich man. I will become a rich man, tomorrow.\"\n\nL-220 And he sit the gun down in the corner, turned his back over to the door, went to sleep. And the man had been following him, for days, slipped in and killed him. He wasn't a rich man, see, he stopped that warning buzzer that was trying to tell him his life was at stake.\n\nL-221 And, brother, sister, you will never be able to... Don't never try to hush that holy calling in your heart, see, by joining a church, by reciting a creed, by belonging to a certain organization.\n\nL-222 There is only one thing can satisfy it, that's the Person, Jesus Christ. \"As the hart panteth for the water brook, so my soul thirsts after Thee, O God. My soul thirsts for the living God!\" See, there is something in you, that wants to see the moving of God. Your soul thirsts for It. Don't stop anything short of That. [Psalms 42:1]\n\nL-223 Don't let some pastor tell you, \"You just have to shake his hand, join the church, or belong to this organization.\" Don't you kill that holy hush. It's warning you. Some day will come when you'll come down to the end of the road.\n\nL-224 Like a little lady in our city we come from. She told the... A little girl went up there to church, and a very fine little girl. And she was coming down the street. She had long hair, you know, and her hair pulled back like a slick of the peeled onion, nearly, and her face looked... no make-up on. And this girl used to make fun of her, said, \"If you didn't have that flat-headed preacher you got up there,\" speaking of me, said--said, \"you could look like something decent. But you look like something out of an antique shop.\" And, oh, she just really raked her over the coals, every time she could see her like that. Said, \"Our pastor is broad-minded.\" Said, \"He--he--he knows them. That, why you do like that? That don't mean anything, how you dress or think.\" It does! God's Bible says it does. We shall live by every Word! [Matthew 4:4]\n\nL-225 So this little girl never paid a bit of attention to her, went on. She is a missionary now.\n\nL-226 So then this--this young lady took a social disease, and she died. A friend of mine pumped the embalming fluid in her when she was dying. He told me, said... After she was dead, he kept smelling the fluid. She had a hole eat in her side, social disease. They didn't even... Even her parents didn't know what was wrong with her. And she died. But before she died...\n\nL-227 She taught Sunday school. And all of her little Sunday school group come in, they wanted to see her when she went off to Heaven, the Angels come and pack her away. And her pastor outside, smoking a cigarette, walking up-and-down the hall in the hospital. And they was all going to sing when she was going to die, you know. They knowed she had to die. Doctors said she was dying, so they was all going to see the Angels come, pack her away.\n\nL-228 And all at once, when she faced the reality! Now, she was a loyal church member, she was a Sunday school teacher, and a loyal church member of a fine big denominational church. But when she started to struggle, death struck her; her eyes bulged out, and she said, \"I'm lost!\" She said, \"I'm lost! Go, get the pastor!\"\n\nL-229 He put his cigarette out, and walked in, said, \"Here, here! Here, here! We'll get the doctor to give you a hypo.\"\n\nL-230 Said, \"I don't want no hypo.\" Said, \"You deceiver of man! I'm dying, and I'm going to hell. And I'm lost because 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min you failed to tell me the Truth. Go get that little Gooduse girl, and bring her up here to me, real quick. She is right.\"\n\nL-231 Wait till you face the reality once. Don't you try to stop that holy hush. Don't you blast It away with some modern, educational, double-barreled shotgun. You listen to that warning of the Holy Ghost, tonight, that's warning you, \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.\" And He is the Word. Let us bow our heads just a moment. [John 14:6]\n\nL-232 I want to quote one more Word of the Lord Jesus, while you're thinking about it. Jesus said, in Matthew 5, \"Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst.\" It's even blessed to have that thirst in you. Have you come to a spot that your--your--your whole system has been so polluted by denominationalisms, and little cults and clans, and things, little church orders, social, like joining lodges, and so forth, from church to church? Has the Devil been able to put that water of pollution, and you're slopping out of it, like a hog in a trough? When, you don't even know what the real quenching thirst of God; to see Him, a reality, by the Holy Spirit living in you, and manifesting. If you're--if you're that way tonight, if you're still thirsting for God, let me tell you: [Matthew 5:6] There is a Fountain filled with Blood, Drawn from Immanuel's veins, Where sinners plunged beneath the flood, Lose all their guilty stain. That dying thief rejoiced to see That Fountain in his day; There may I, though vile as he, Wash all my sins away. Ever since by faith I saw that stream Thy flowing wounds supply, Redeeming love has been my theme, And shall be till I die.\n\nL-233 If you've got that thirst tonight, to know more about God, and to come closer to Him, will you just raise up your hand now while every head is bowed, say, \"Pray for me.\" O God, look at the hands!\n\nL-234 Out into the land where the broadcast is coming now, from East, North, West, and South, you in them rooms, raise up your hands to the pastors and whatever is there, that you desire; you, something in you, thirsting for God. That holy thirst!\n\nL-235 Don't satisfy it. Oh, you say, \"Brother Branham, I--I shouted once. I danced in the Spirit.\" Don't, don't, don't take that. No.\n\nL-236 Wait till that satisfaction comes, the satisfaction Portion of the fullness of the Holy Spirit comes in, then these joy bells of shouting, and speaking in tongues, and dancing in the Spirit, will come. You won't have to do it by the music. You will do it when you're going down the road, in your car. You will do it when you're sweeping the floor. You will do it when you're driving nails in the wall, with your carpenter work. Wherever you are, that Joy unspeakable and full of glory! Now let us pray. [Acts 2:1-4]\n\nL-237 Dear Heavenly Father! Long, lengthy, drawed out, this little Message tonight, but, Dear God, may Your Holy Spirit deliver the--the meaning to every heart. Right in this church, tonight, there was just multiplied numbers of hands up, all the way around the halls and everywhere. We--we pray, dear God, for them. Oh, may that satisfying Portion of God, which is Christ, the Hope of Glory, the Hope of Life in you, may It come to each one of them.\n\nL-238 Way out across the nation, from California, way up in New York now, where it's early in the morning, they're listening in up there; over in--in New Hampshire, and down along in Boston, and all the way down in Texas, through Indiana, out into California, and around. O God, look at those hands; look what's beneath them, Lord, that heart there that's hungering and thirsting. 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min\n\nL-239 This perverted day, where the Devil has blinded people's eyes, just to join church, and say, \"That's all you need.\" And they still look at their own self and see the way they do, and the desire they have to be like the world. [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-240 When, the Bible tells us, \"If we even love the things of the world, the love of God is not even in us.\" [I John 2:15]\n\nL-241 Just think, Father, how perverted that he can make that real true Word, how that they can say, \"Oh, we believe the Bible, but not This. We don't believe This. We believe This was for another age. We believe this is That,\" because, some denomination has twisted their minds into that cesspool.\n\nL-242 When, Jesus said, \"Whosoever shall take one Word out of This, or add one word to It, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.\" [Revelation 22:18-19]\n\nL-243 Dear God! Think of the disappointments there at Judgment, when people has lived a good, clean, holy life, went to church just as loyal as they could be, and lost.\n\nL-244 Think of those Pharisees, how, from little boys, they trained in the Word, come up through schools and everything, holy (had to be, or they'd be stoned to death), and Jesus said, \"You are of your father the Devil.\" [John 8:44]\n\nL-245 How that Israel went down there! And let this be a warning to the Pentecostals, Lord, across the land. How that Moses, a prophet, came down into Egypt, to fulfill the Word of God, to bring the evening light to them! How they seen the great miracles of God! How they followed him, crossed the Red Sea, was baptized unto him, went into the wilderness and eat Angels' food that fell from Heaven. And then refused to take all the Word, when they come back from Kadesh-barnea... to Kadesh-barnea, from the--from the promised land, and said, \"they're like giants; we can't do it.\" When, God said, \"I've already give you the land\"! Border line! Jesus said, \"They are, every one, perished. They are dead,\" lost, without God, though they done all these things. They seen these miracles; enjoyed, danced up-and-down the seacoast, with Miriam, when they beat the tambourine. And only three, out of the two million, went in. [Exodus 16:15], [John 6:49, 58], [Deuteronomy 8:19-20]\n\nL-246 We realize, Father, that when the sperm, the genes from the male and female, come together, there is only one, out of a million, that's accepted. One germ from the male finds the fertile egg of the woman, the female, and a million others perish.\n\nL-247 There is a million, two million, come out of Egypt; two, Joshua and Caleb, entered the land. One out of a million. Father, I--I tremble when I think of that. Think, across the world today, five hundred million Christians, that would be five hundred if You should come tonight. O God, let us remember that every Word of God stands, a memorial. We must believe It. We must obey It. [Numbers 26:65]\n\nL-248 And when You said, \"Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.\" And, God, You are still calling, tonight, and the promise is as long as You call. [Acts 2:28]\n\nL-249 And clergymen has twisted the minds of those people, and directed it by an educational, denominational school of theology, to a thing to say, \"Oh, you just believe.\" The Devil believes also, but he can't receive the Holy Spirit. Judas Iscariot was a... done all the--the rest, the disciples did, preach the Gospel; but when it come time for him to get the Holy Ghost, he showed his colors. [James 2:19]\n\nL-250 God, may the people of the land tonight realize that, without that experience, they are lost. May it be tonight that their souls will be satisfied with Thy Portion, Lord, as we commend them into Thy hand. They are Yours, Lord. We're only responsible for the Word. I pray that they will believe with all their heart, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. We ask in Jesus' Name. Amen. I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min On Calvary's tree.\n\nL-251 Oh, is He your satisfying Portion? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Oh, my! You love Him with all your heart? [\"Amen.\"] Now, them Words are sometimes cutting, but let's just sing in the Spirit now, see, each one of us now. Let's shake hands with the brother setting next to you, sister, and just say, \"God bless you, pilgrim,\" as we sing it again. [Brother Branham shakes hands with the people.] I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree.\n\nL-252 Now we shook hands with each other. Now let's just close our eyes and sing in the Spirit, raise our hands to Him. I love Him, I love Him, Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree. Oh, isn't He wonderful? Wonderful, wonderful, Jesus is to me, The Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God is He; Oh, saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame, Wonderful is my Redeemer, praise His Name! Oh, wonderful, wonderful, Jesus is to me, Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God is He; Saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame, Wonderful is my Redeemer, praise His Name!\n\nL-253 Oh, are you enthused about your experience with Christ? [Congregation rejoices, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Isn't He wonderful? Doesn't He satisfy? I once was lost, now I'm found, free from condemnation, Jesus gives liberty and a full salvation; Saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame, Wonderful is my Redeemer, praise His Name. Oh, wonderful, wonderful, Jesus is to me, Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God is He; Oh, saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame, Wonderful is my Redeemer, praise His Name!\n\nL-254 Do you believe that's Scriptural? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] The Bible said, \"Clap your hands. Make a joyful noise unto the Lord.\" You know, I always wanted to play music. My daughter, Rebekah, is taking piano. My little boy is taking trumpet. But I--I did learn an instrument of ten strings, [Brother Branham begins clapping his hands]. Wonderful, wonderful, Jesus is to me, Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God is He; Saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame, Wonderful is my Redeemer, praise His Name! 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min Do you love Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] We'll walk in the Light, a beautiful Light, Come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. We'll walk in the Light, it's such a beautiful Light, It comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world.\n\nL-255 [Brother Branham begins to hum, \"Jesus, the Light of the World,\" and then the congregation also hums with him.--Ed.] Worship God with everything you have. When the saints go marching in, When the saints go marching in, Lord, I want to be in that number When the saints go marching in. Oh, when they crown Him Lord of all, When they crown Him Lord of all, Lord, I want to be in that number When they crown Him Lord of all. Oh, when the sun refuse to shine, When the sun refuse to shine, Lord, I want to be in that number When the sun refuse to shine.\n\nL-256 Do you love that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now I wonder if you got your feet converted, you don't dance anymore, out there for the world? See? Let's pat our feet, to the Lord, to the Lord. Is your hands converted, you don't steal anymore? Your lips are converted, you don't lie anymore? Just don't get religion in your head, get it all over you. That's it. It takes the whole man. That's right. Now let's pat our feet. When the saints go marching in, When the saints go marching in, Lord, I want to be in that number When the saints go marching in. Oh, when the saints go marching in, When the saints go marching in, Lord, I want to be in that number When the saints go marching in. Now let's just raise our hands. When the saints go marching in, When the saints go marching in, O Lord, I want to be in that number 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min When the saints go marching in. When they crown Him Lord of all, When they crown Him Lord of all, Lord, I want to be in that number When they crown Him Lord of all.\n\nL-257 Don't you love Him? [The congregation rejoices, \"Amen! Glory! Hallelujah!\"--Ed.] Then we'll walk in the Light (He is the Light, you know), It's a beautiful Light, It comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Well, shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world.\n\nL-258 Do you believe He is the Light of the world? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Do you? Paul said, \"When I sing, I'll sing in the Spirit. If I worship, I'll worship in the Spirit.\" See, whatever you do, do it all in the Spirit. That's right. And the Spirit brings the Word to Life. Is that right? That's right. Yes, sir. All ye saints of Light proclaim, Jesus, the Light of the world; Grace and mercy in His Name, Jesus, the Light of... Then what do we do? We'll walk in the Light, beautiful Light, Come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world.\n\nL-259 Sorry to confuse you players, like that, but I just get carried away. I don't know no better than just to worship. That's the way you do it. Yes, sir. I'm thankful for this opportunity, Brother Mack, to come and fellowship with you and your church here tonight, all these fine people.\n\nL-260 And you that raised your hands for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, I trust that you'll meet Pastor Mack here, or some of them, and go back in a room here. And just remember, when God spoke the Word in the beginning, and said \"let there be,\" there had to be! And He said, \"Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.\" See, it's got to happen. Come to visit your pastor here, and stand by him as he preaches the Gospel. [Matthew 5:6], [Genesis 1:3, 6]\n\nL-261 Now let's sing again that good old song, I just love that, \"We'll walk in the Light.\"\n\nL-262 Jesus said, \"I am the Light,\" and you are in Him. See? How do you get into Him? Joining Him? No. Shaking? No. Baptism of water? No. \"By one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body, which is the Body of Christ.\" And in that Body is nine spiritual gifts operating through the local body, the local church. That's apostolic, if I ever knew of it. That's right. So we'll keep in the Light, in the beautiful Light, It comes where the dewdrops of mercy... [Brother Branham speaks to Pastor Mack--Ed.] All right,...?... Shine all around us by day and by... [Brother Branham speaks to Pastor Mack--Ed.] Been a real pleasure. [Brother Mack says, \"Thank you, brother. Thank you.\"] 65-0919, Thirst, Grant Way Assembly Of God, Tucson, AZ, 112 min Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

[The children give Brother Branham a gift.] Thank you. [A sister says, \"Just a little gift, Brother Branham, the children saved their pennies and nickels. And...?...\"] Thank you. Thank you, my little brother. Thank you, children. I sure thank you, very, very much. And God bless you.\n\nL-3 You know, Jesus said, \"Insomuch as you give unto the least of these, you have done it to Me.\" You're the men and women of tomorrow. If there is a tomorrow, you will there. [Matthew 25:40]\n\nL-4 [Blank.spot.on.tape. A group sings another song--Ed.] I believe I could preach four hours now, after all that. I was beginning to think I was getting tired. No wonder you little girls can sing so well, you little girls and little boys; listen how your big sisters sing, and your mothers, wonderful singers. That's really pretty. Who is this little girl that led that song, aren't you the little girl I met across there? Sure have a beautiful voice; all of you. You just... I believe the best singing I have ever heard, is right here. You all practice that all the time? [A brother says, \"No. That's how we sing.\"] Well, I tell you, you--you certainly are blessed with some real good singing.\n\nL-5 I like good singing. I just love real good singing. I've always said, when I get to Heaven I want to get where they're singing, and listen. I never could get my fill of singing. You know, singing gives courage. You know that, don't you? The soldiers, when they're going to battle, you know what they do? They play music and sing, and things to give them courage. And when we're going to battle, we sing, and--and it gives us courage to go on.\n\nL-6 I thank you little fellows for that nice gift. And it's... Mrs. Branham, and from Rebekah, and Joseph, and Sarah, and all of us, we thank you very much. It's hard to say, how to tell them little fellows, \"No. You saved your pennies. I--I don't want to take it.\" You know how I feel, I don't want to take it. But yet I looked in here and they had a ten-dollar bill in this card. I thought, \"Can I take that?\" I thought, \"How can I do it?\"\n\nL-7 But I remember a little story I want you to know. One day there was a widow woman, she had a bunch of children, perhaps her... them little children's papa was gone. And she only had two pennies. And she come down the street, one time... And it was tithing money, just pennies like you all saved, and she threw it into the treasury of God. Jesus was standing there, watching her. And I have wondered, \"What would I have done if I had been standing there?\" I would probably run up and said, \"No, no, sister, don't do that. We--we don't, really don't need it. You need it for them children.\" See? Now, I wouldn't have let her done it. But Jesus let her do it. See, He let her do it. Why? He knows it's more blessed to give than it is to receive. He knowed what He would do for her, see. So I thank you little fellows, with all my heart. [Mark 12:42-44], [Acts 20:35]\n\nL-8 I want to thank each and every one of you, for this fine time of fellowship, Brother Leo and Gene. This has actually been three days of worship, for me. Even out in the jungle, when I try to let myself go and think I was hunting, I somehow or another, I look at you and hear you talk. I had the privilege this afternoon to visit your homes. I never seen, walked into any, I'm going to call it a village, that I ever seen so many clean, neat homes and people, and so much respect for Christ and the Gospel. I--I never seen it anywhere. And you're certainly started on the right road, just keep going and God will be with you. And I got to see some of you. I seen, the other day, these sisters, I didn't even know them, 'cause all I could see would just be about their eyes and nose, out from under one of those hoods. And now I believe I know you better, through the courtesy of Brother Leo and Gene, who taken me around and visit your homes; and get to shake hands with the--the little children, the prophets and prophetesses of the age to come, if there is an age to come.\n\nL-9 You know, Jesus loves little children. You know, He does. And there was a little boy, one time, named Moses, 65-1031A, Leadership, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 56 min we're going to talk about him in just in a little bit. And he was a very fine... You know what made him, helped make him a fine boy? He had a good mother to raise him. See, that's what. She taught him about the Lord. And you little boys and girls has got the same kind of mothers to raise you, teach you about the Lord. Just mind them.\n\nL-10 You know what, you know what the first Commandment is in the Bible, the first Commandment with promise, with a promise? May be a little hard for you to understand these Commandments. The first Commandment, is, \"Not to have any other god but Him.\" But the great Commandment... And the first Commandment that has a promise to it, see, is to the children. Did you know that? See, He said, \"Children, obey your parents, which may lengthen the days upon the earth, that the Lord thy God has given thee.\" To mind your parents and do what you're doing, it may give you longer life upon the earth, that the Lord has given you, more time to serve Him. [Ephesians 6:1-3]\n\nL-11 I hope, today, that I'm looking at a bunch of preachers and singers and evangelists of the day that is to come, if there is a day after ours.\n\nL-12 And there is only one thing up here, you--you kill a fellow with kindness. I eat till I couldn't eat, and I--and I never was treated so much. If I had been an Angel, dropped out of Heaven, I couldn't have been treated any nicer. The only thing I can say to you, is, \"Thank you.\" And when you're down Tucson way, I might not be able to treat you that nice, 'cause I don't know how; I haven't got the manners to do it, but I'll do the best I can. Come down.\n\nL-13 Brother and Sister Shantz, I want to certainly thank them. And I had the privilege of meeting your pretty, young daughter, and son, this afternoon. And--and for letting us have his home here open for worship. There was such things taking place in the Bible day, you know, that the Gospel was... I know it sounds very little. We, we would think it isn't. But this is just the same as God... to God, as them was in that day.\n\nL-14 Remember, if there would be another many years, they would look back here and say, \"If I'd have only lived in the days up there at Prescott! If I'd have only lived...\" See? Now we are living in that day. See? Then we come down to the end of the road, then we wait for our reward at the big Day.\n\nL-15 Now we're going to open the Word of God and read. But just before we do, let us speak to Him just a moment.\n\nL-16 Dear Jesus, I cannot express my--my feelings and my gratitude towards Brother Mercier, Brother Goad, and all these fine people and their little children, of how kind they have showed us since we've been here. The kindness is beyond anything that we expected. And we know that they were lovely and sweet. But we didn't know that we would be treated in such a real royal way. And, Lord, I pray that Your Presence will always be in this camp of people, the Holy Spirit will fill every heart here, and You will give them Eternal Life. And may we, as we enjoy today, may there be an endless Day that when we'll meet in the Presence of Him Who we are worshiping and love, and give all praise for these things. Till that time, Lord, keep us loyal to Him and to His Word. In Jesus' Name we pray. Amen.\n\nL-17 Now, I had you so long this morning, I'll try and make it real quick this afternoon, and talk in a way that may be to little fellows, and the older will understand, too.\n\nL-18 I want to read a--a Scripture here, found in the Book of St. Mark, and I want to read from the 17th verse of the 10th chapter of St. Mark, a portion. And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeling down and asking him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, and that is, God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I done, obeyed, observed (rather) from my youth. Then Jesus beholding him loved him, this young fellow; and he said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasures in heaven: and come, take up thy cross, and follow me. And he was sad at this saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions. [Mark 10:17-22] 65-1031A, Leadership, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 56 min\n\nL-19 Now to the children, and to the adults and all, I want to make this little Message just as timely as I can, and as quick as I can. And I want to take for a text, \"follow Me,\" and I want to take for a subject: Leadership. Follow, and someone to lead; Leadership, and \"follow Me.\" The young, the people, the...\n\nL-20 Remember that, the first step that any of us ever made, somebody led us. You mothers remember the first steps that junior and the little girl made, and they don't remember it no more. But somebody led you to your first step. I remember Billy Paul when he made his first step, Joseph and all of them, when they made their first step.\n\nL-21 It's usually a mother that gets to lead a child to its first step, 'cause she is home while the daddy is out working, trying to make a living. But, it's, they make their first step. And at nighttime when they come in, the father, he is always saying. \"Oh, dad,\" she said, \"Johnny and Mary,\" the little boy or girl, \"can walk! Come and look!\" And just one step, maybe mother had to hold; had to hold mother's finger, 'cause you was kind of weak, and kind of turned sideways, you know, and fall down a little. So you had to hold to mama's hand, to make your first step.\n\nL-22 Now, somebody helped you, when you made your first step. And your--your last step you ever make in life, somebody will be leading you. See, that's right. I want you to remember that. Your first step, somebody led you. And your last step, somebody will be leading you.\n\nL-23 We have to be led. You know, God likened us unto sheep. And did you know a sheep can't lead itself? He'll wander away and stray away, and he--he just can't lead himself. And he has to have somebody to lead him. And sometime... The shepherd is supposed to lead the sheep. Now that was back in the days of the Lord Jesus, He was the good Shepherd that led the sheep.\n\nL-24 But today, you see, we're living in another day, everything is changed and perverted. You know what man has to lead sheep today? A goat. And you know where that goat leads them? Right into the slaughter. Them little sheep don't know where they're going, so the goat goes up a--a pen, up at the slaughter, and the sheep don't know no more than to follow a leader, so it leads them right up into this slaughter. And then the goat jumps over the track, and the sheep goes in and gets killed. See, the goat, a wrong leader.\n\nL-25 But Jesus, the good Shepherd Who led the sheep, He led them to Life and held their hand. See, but somebody has to lead the sheep.\n\nL-26 The first is the mother's kindness, then the father's word. After the mother gives you your first step, then you look to your daddy, all of us, for wisdom, because he is the head of the house. And he usually... Not that he's any smarter, but he--he's just made a leader of his family, so we follow what our daddy says do. When he says, \"Now, son, I would like for you to do a certain--certain thing,\" then we listen to him because it's wisdom. But listen, see, he has learned a whole lot and we've got to ask him, to see what he learned, and then we can profit by his, what he has learned. He tells us, \"Now don't go and do this, because I did that. My father told me not to do it, but I did it, and it caused this to happen to me, something bad.\" So, see, we'll... Then he, daddy, tells us how to do, and what to do right.\n\nL-27 Then after mother leads us, till a time we have to get a little wisdom, to understand, from daddy, then we get another. We get another leader, and that's a teacher, a good school teacher. She tries to teach you and give you an education, to fit you better in life, for a place, a position that you can--you can read your Bible and you can read the songs, and you can learn of God and read, yourself, you see. And then, another thing, maybe you'd have business, and somebody write you a letter, mama, daddy, somebody write you a letter, you couldn't read it. See? So the teacher, she has you then, and she leads you to--to--to learn to write and to read. And it's a good thing, a good teacher, to teach you right. But now after you leave that, you, after you leave the teacher, one teacher after the other one, from a little primer, a little first grade, on till you get out of high school or go to college. Then when you leave college, and then the teacher is through leading you. See?\n\nL-28 Now, mama has taught you to walk, see. Papa has taught you how to be brilliant and a nice young man, and how to take care of yourself and behave yourself. The teacher has taught you an education, how to read and write right. But now you are leaving papa, you are leaving mama, and you are leaving the teacher, now somebody has to take you from here on. Now who do you want to take you from here on? [A child says, \"Jesus.\"--Ed.] That's right. Jesus, to take you 65-1031A, Leadership, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 56 min from there on. Now, that's a very good answer, very fine. Jesus takes you from there on.\n\nL-29 Now you see this young fellow that we're talking about, he is called the rich young ruler. Now, this fellow, he had been guided pretty well. Now, his mother had taught him to walk. And, you see, he was yet a young man, maybe just out of high school, and a very popular young man. And by being well trained, maybe walked correct, and so forth, how his mother had taught him.\n\nL-30 And he had been a--a successful young man, too, because, look, he was already rich. And he was just a--a young man, maybe eighteen years old, just out of high school, and he was rich. Now, you see, he had the right kind of a teacher to teach him to walk right. And he had a right kind of a teacher, his father; till even at yet a young man and he was--he was rich in money, he had made him a lot of money. He might have been a real... He was a ruler, even at that age, very successful. See? And now he had a--a teacher that had taught him, taught him the right thing, how he would. He had his education.\n\nL-31 And then another teacher this young man had had, which that depends on how you're raised up, but this young man had a religious teaching in his home. [Mark 10:20]\n\nL-32 Now, some children, did you know there is a lot of little children that don't have any religious teaching at home? Their father and mother don't believe in God. And their father and mother, drink, smoke, fight, and run out, at one another, at night, and things, and don't cook their little boy's and girl's suppers, and things. Aren't you glad you got a real good Christian father and mother? Now, when you have children, don't you want to be the same kind of a father and mother as your father and mother is? See? Now, but that's all good.\n\nL-33 Now, this young man had had, and he had a religious teaching. See, that was far beyond what some of them had, 'cause they don't have religious teaching. But this young man had had religious teaching, because, see, because he said he kept the Commandments since he was a boy.\n\nL-34 Now you all got good religious teachers, too, each one of you. And you little teen-age girls and boys, you all had good teachers, your father and mother here in this camp, got everything that you... every potential that you know, that's possible, for you to make a real good man and woman, a servant to God.\n\nL-35 Because, remember, you're going to die someday, or either be translated into Heaven. And if you die before His Coming, you will be raptured first. Did you know that? Did you know those who are dead... If mama and papa dies before you do, and Jesus doesn't come in our generation, do you know these, papa and mama, will come forth first, glorified, before you? See? The trumpet of God shall sound, and the dead in Christ shall rise first, and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them. We'll be changed like that. We've got to remember, that's the main thing in life. You understand now? That's the main thing in life, we got to do, is to get ready to meet God. [I Thessalonians 4:16-17], [I Corinthians 15:51]\n\nL-36 Now, just religion won't work. See, this one young ruler here, he said, \"Good Master...\" Now remember, before I say it. He had been taught to walk right. He had a good education. He had been taught business. And was rich, and was a ruler, and had religion. But he was confronted with another problem, and it confronts all of us, Eternal Life. Religion doesn't give us Eternal Life. Religious, is a covering, but it don't give us Eternal Life. And yet, him taught with the best teachers there was, he was yet lacking something. And the young man knew it, because he said, \"Good Master, what can I do to inherit Eternal Life?\" [Mark 10:17-25]\n\nL-37 Now, you, you believe Jesus is God, don't you? So He knew the thoughts of the young man, so He said, \"Keep the Commandments.\" He went right back to his religion, to see what he would say about his religion. He said now, in other words, \"Keep your religion.\" [Mark 10:17], [Mark 10:20]\n\nL-38 He said, \"I have did this, since a boy,\" little boys like you. \"My mama and papa, and my priest, taught me religion. But I know, in my religion, that I still don't have Eternal Life.\" See? You can be good. Don't steal. Don't smoke. Don't lie. Don't lie to papa and mama. Don't tell that first lie, 'cause, one tell one, then it's easy to tell another one, see. But you mustn't do that. Don't tell the first one. Did you know your body is not made to lie? You know, they got a device now, it's--it's on your nerves. They can put a 65-1031A, Leadership, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 56 min little band around your wrist here, and put one across your head, and then you can say there, say you say, \"I--I--I lied about that, but I can say it so easy that they--they will believe that I'm telling it the truth.\" And you can say...\n\nL-39 They would say, \"Was you at a certain place, like did you sit in that Brother Shantz's trailer, while Brother Branham preached, Sunday afternoon on this day?\" And you say, \"No, sir. I didn't sit there. No, sir.\"\n\nL-40 You know what that lie detector will say? \"Yes, sir, you did. Yes, sir, you did.\" You say, \"I did not.\" It'll say, \"Yes, you did.\"\n\nL-41 Why? Because a lie is such a horrible thing. The body wasn't made to lie. And it's such a horrible thing, till it upsets the whole nerve system, when you lie. Whew! Upset like that, will give you ulcers, fungus growth, it'd kill you. And then a lie is a bad thing, 'cause, see, you're not supposed to lie, to steal, to do any of these things. Now, so this young man had probably been... he hadn't lied, he never stole, and he was conscious that he needed ever, Eternal Life. So he said, \"What can I do to have It?\" And Jesus is showing here now that religion won't do it. So He sent right back to him, and said, \"Keep the Commandments.\"\n\nL-42 He said, \"Master, I have did this since I was a little boy, or little, when just a little bitty fellow I did this.\" But he knowed he didn't have Eternal Life. So He said then, \"If you would enter into Life, Eternal Life, want to be perfect, then go sell what...\" [Mark 10:17-25]\n\nL-43 See, now, it's all right to have money. See, it's all right to have money, be rich. And be a ruler, that's all right. But it--it's the way you act after you become that, see.\n\nL-44 He said, \"Go sell what you've got, and give it to the poor, them people that hasn't got anything; then come, follow Me, and you will have treasures in Heaven.\" But the young man had so much money till he didn't know what to do with it. Now, see, he was very popular, that young man was. [Mark 10:20-22]\n\nL-45 And he--he--he was well equipped for life, the way his father and mother, and the priests and all of them, had equipped him, but still he knowed he was lacking something. Now I'm talking to the adults. He, he knowed he was lacking something here. He didn't have Eternal Life. He knew it. See?\n\nL-46 Religion won't produce Eternal Life. Forms, sensation, you feel something; you--you could get scared, and feel something. See? Crying, that's good; shouting, that's good; but that still ain't It, see. You are confronted with Eternal Life. You say, \"Well, I have been just a staunch Baptist, Methodist, or Presbyterian, or Pentecostal.\" That still isn't the question.\n\nL-47 This young man was, too, he was taught in the religion of the day, but he still didn't have Eternal Life, so he wanted to know what to do. He had been guided successful, to This. But when he was confronted with It, he refused to be guided to Eternal Life, or to be led. His other leaders had had such a hold on him until he didn't want to turn it loose. See? [Mark 10:17] Now, that is something like what Brother Branham is saying. Some of it a little too deep for you, see.\n\nL-48 Education is fine, you should go to school and learn. See, that's good, but that won't save you. To have plenty of money, that's good, you could raise your children, give them good clothes and things. And like papa and mama has worked for you all, and things. That's good, but that still won't save you. See? Or, you could get in a laboratory and learn how to put different things together, or split atoms, or whatever they do, and--and get in a--a rocket and--and go to the moon, but that won't save you.\n\nL-49 You've got to face one thing, Eternal Life, and there is only one Person Who can give That to you. Mama can't give It to you. Papa can't give It to you. Your pastor can't give It to you. Your leader here can't give It to you. Everybody that gets Eternal Life has got to come to Jesus Christ. He is the only One Who can give That part. [John 3:16], [Romans 6:23] 65-1031A, Leadership, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 56 min\n\nL-50 Your teacher can give you an education, she can teach you; you have to learn it. Your--your mother can teach you to walk; you have to learn to walk. Your father can teach you how to be a businessman, or what; you have to learn that. But only Jesus can give you Eternal Life. See?\n\nL-51 Your priest, your leader, or so forth, can teach you your religion, you can learn the Message that we are trying to teach, but still that won't give you Eternal Life. You've got to accept the Person, Jesus Christ. You understand that, all of you? Got to accept the Person, Jesus Christ, to have Eternal Life. Now, but sometimes other leadership gets so much influence on us till we don't know what to do then when that--that time comes.\n\nL-52 Now, what a fatal thing it is to reject the leadership to Eternal Life, because, see, that's Life that never can end. Now, the education, that's fine, that'll help us here. Business, that's fine. Money, that's fine. Be a good boy and girl, that's fine. But, you see, when life is finished here, that's all. You understand? You adults understand? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] See, that's all. But then we've got to accept Jesus Christ, for Eternal Life. Jesus alone can lead you to That. [Mark 10:22]\n\nL-53 And though, see, this young man had achieved all these things in school, and by his parents and everything, he--he lost the greatest thing that he could have had, the leadership of the Holy Spirit, for Jesus said, \"Come, follow Me.\" [Mark 10:21]\n\nL-54 And you girls that's just getting out of school, you graduate probably, some of you, pretty soon, and you young boys; the greatest leadership there is is Jesus Christ, for that's the Leadership to Eternal Life. Now, this Leadership confronts every human being, they are given the opportunity to choose. And that's one great thing we have in life, is to choose. Someday... You know, papa and mama, they chose to have a nice little boy and girl, like you--you all are.\n\nL-55 Then, you--you have a right, after a while, to choose whether you want to learn from the teacher, or not. The teacher can teach you, but you can just be a--a little bad boy, you just won't learn; a little, bad girl, won't listen at all. See, you--you have a choice to do that, yet you're little. And mother say, \"Did you get A's on your report card?\" \"No, I got very poor.\" See, now you can...\n\nL-56 Mother say, \"Now you have to study.\" And you have to do that then, keep studying like mother told you, like daddy told you. See, you have to study. But you have a choice, you can do it or not do it. You can say, \"I don't want to.\" See, you have a choice. After a while, you'll have a choice of what girl you are going to marry, what boy you're going to marry. You have a choice everywhere in life. And then you've got a choice, again, to whether you want to live after this life; or just be a good, popular person, a movie star, or a dancer, or something another.\n\nL-57 And look at these little girls here with that pretty voice, a while ago, singing. That child had to cultivate that voice, and she'd be an opera singer, or some singer. I hear these little boys' voices, these boys, you could be like an Elvis Presley, selling your birthright. See, you don't want that. See, it's a talent God gave you, and you've got to choose who, where you're going to use that talent, for God, or whether you're going to use it for the Devil. See?\n\nL-58 Brother Leo here, your brother, see, now he had a talent, to come and lead people. Now what's he going to do with it? Is he going into business and make hisself a millionaire; or should he come out here and make a home where people that wants to come together and get all you little children? See, you have to choose what you're going to do.\n\nL-59 Each one of us has to make a choice. And it's confronted to us. But we're all confronted with this one thing: \"What are we going to do about Eternal Life? We going to live hereafter, or not?\" Then we have to come to Jesus, to get That. The opportunity of choosing, that's one thing God gave us. He don't force something on us. He just lets us make our own choice. So you have to not be forced, but just make your own choice.\n\nL-60 Now let's just follow this, adults and all now, for a few minutes, and the children, all together. Let's follow this young man, and the choice that he made, and see where it led him. 65-1031A, Leadership, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 56 min\n\nL-61 Now, these girls with that pretty voices, these young boys. Now maybe you come up and be you would have a voice to sing. Now just take that one thing, you could, my, you might someday take it, \"I...\" You know this boy called Elvis Presley? You've heard my tapes. You've heard how I don't degrade the boy, but that boy was had the opportunity that you all got. See, and what he... He found out he could sing. And watch what he did, just the same thing Judas did, Judas Iscariot, he sold out Jesus. Jesus gave that boy that good voice. And what does he do? Turn around and sell it out to the Devil. See, he's got to come to the end of the road. See? He refused to walk with Jesus.\n\nL-62 Now this young fellow here, this rich young ruler, he did the same thing. Let's follow and see what he done. No doubt, with the great man that he was, probably a handsome young man, dark hair combed down on the side, nice clothes. The young ladies thought, \"Boy, that's a handsome young man!\" Oh, they would. He would maybe wave at them, and they would flirt back with him, and things.\n\nL-63 And he thought he was a great fellow, person, see, because he was handsome, he was young. He wasn't looking down there at the end of the road. He was just looking here. \"I'm young. I'm handsome. I'm rich. I can buy anything I want to. I can take these girls, and, boy, they all like me. And they know I'm a great man.\" And, see, he had all that. He had followed the instructions of his father, and everything. \"And I'm very religious. I go to church.\" And now he could follow that, see; very popular, rich, and famous. And, and he...\n\nL-64 Just like today, like you had the opportunity to become a movie star, see, or something like that. Most young kids today, you talk to them, they know more about these movie stars than they know about Jesus. You see? And, see, you--you children are learning about Jesus. Where they sit down, and some play come on on a movie, or something another, they know the actors and all there, all about it. They know all that better than That. You tell them about the Bible, they don't know nothing about Bible. See, it's making the wrong choice. Now, some singer selling their God-given talent, for fame!\n\nL-65 Then we see him at life's end. Let's follow him a little further. You know what the Bible says about this young fellow? He become more successful. So, sometimes success don't mean that you've made the right choice. You know what he did? He went out and had all big times, and throwed big parties, and spent lots of money and everything, on the girls and everything. And then he got married and maybe had a family. And--and he--he just increased so much till he had to build new barns and things. And he said, \"You see, I didn't follow Jesus, and look what I got!\" See?\n\nL-66 You may hear people say that, and I have, \"Well, look, He's blessed me.\" That don't mean it all. See? And after a while his barns swelled till even he said, why, even, \"Soul, take your rest. I've got so much money and so much success! And I'm such great man! I belong to all the clubs. And I have the riches of the world in my hands. I own great sums of land and sums of money, and, why, my, there everybody likes me, a very fine person to be.\" But you know, the Bible said that, that night, God said to him, \"I'm going to require your soul.\"\n\nL-67 Then what did happened? Now there was a beggar, a poor old Christian that layed out there by his gate. And just when they... [Luke 16:20] Up in Jerusalem, over there, they--they eat up on top of the house. And the bread crumbs fall off like this, and the pieces of meat, and so forth, hit the floor when they drop them. And they don't pick them up, because everything in Jerusalem, the old city, it--it's... Is it all right to say a little joke here? They're f-o-b. You know what that is? Flies on the bread, flies on the beef, flies on the butter, f-o-b, flies on everything. They got out in the street, in the gutters and everything, and fly in and get right up on it.\n\nL-68 So these people up there, they get up on top of the--of the building. And they eat, and then they drop this off, and then they sweep that off. And the dogs, in the streets, eats the crumbs. And he let this poor old Christian lay there in the street and just eat the crumbs that dropped from his plate from his bed, or from his table.\n\nL-69 And then when he got in, after a while, he had sores, and he didn't have anything to put on his sores. His name was Lazarus. And the dogs come and licked his sores so he could try to get well. 65-1031A, Leadership, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 56 min\n\nL-70 Well, you know, after a while, this rich man, when, he saw he had money to buy all kinds of medicine, if he got sick, have all kinds of doctors. But, you know, sometimes doctors can't help us, medicine won't help us, nothing can help us; we're at the mercy of God. And he come down to the end of his road; the doctors couldn't help him, and the nurses couldn't help him, and medicine couldn't help him, and he died. And then when his soul left his body, see, it left all of his money, all of his education, everything that he had, all of his popularity. They give him a great big funeral, maybe half-masted the flag, and--and the mayor of the city come, and they, and the preacher come and--and said, \"Our brother now has gone to Glory,\" and all like that.\n\nL-71 But the Bible said, that, \"He lifted up his eyes in hell, in torment, and looked way across that great gulf there, and seen that beggar that had been laying, there in his door, over in Heaven. And he cried, 'Send Lazarus down here with a little water. These flames are tormenting.' Said, 'Oh, no. See, you took the wrong choice in life.'\" [Luke 16:23]\n\nL-72 See, when he come to the end of the road, to step out of life! He had been led by religion. He had been led by education. He had been led by the influence of his--of his success. But, you see, he had nothing to hold his hand, those things end there. You understand, little fellow? You adults do. What I'm... See, he had nothing to hold him. His money couldn't hold him. His friends with the doctors couldn't hold him. Medicine couldn't hold him. His priest, his religion, couldn't hold him. So, there was only one thing for him to do. He had--he had refused to accept Jesus, Eternal Life. So what did he have to do? Sink down into death, into hell. What a fatal mistake that young man had when he refused to walk with Jesus, be led by Jesus. He refused to do it.\n\nL-73 So many young people are making that mistake, today, refusing to be led by the--by the Lord Jesus. Now we see what a fatal thing it is to refuse Eternal Life and be led by Jesus, a Leadership, when He said, \"Come, follow Me.\" [Mark 10:21] See what this handsome little man said this afternoon? When you get out of school, when you get away from, you need another leader, but let that be Jesus. And Jesus is the Bible. Do you believe that? This is Jesus' Life and His Commandments to us, in letter form. So we have to look into This, to see. This is the blueprint. This is the map that He told us to follow, to--to begin Eternal Life. Now we find out that this young man was lost.\n\nL-74 Now let's take another. Would you like, would you have time to take another rich young ruler, that made the right move? Would you like to hear that? All right, we'll try it now. Now let us take another rich young ruler who was confronted with the same thing. Now we see where that boy went, that lived a pretty good life, but died and was lost in hell. And now here we're going to talk about another young man who was confronted with the same thing. He was a rich man, a young man, and was a ruler, and, but he accepted the leadership of Christ; like the little boy told us a while ago, that we should let lead us. He accepted it. [Hebrews 11:23]\n\nL-75 The Scripture for this is found, if you want to look it up after I get through, see, is in Hebrews, the 11th chapter, and the 23rd to the 29th verse. Let me just read It. Is that all right? You'll bear with me just a little bit, won't you? You don't mind if I don't, will you? See? So we just... We'll just read this, then you say, \"I heard Brother Branham read this out of the Bible.\" See? And you know it's there then. It wasn't what I said, it's what He said. Now you listen here, of what the Bible said here of this nice fellow, see. Now look.By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.By faith Moses, when he... come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; (listen)Choosing rather to suffer the affliction with the people of God, than to suffer the pleasures of sin for a season;Esteeming the reproach of Christ... [Hebrews 11:26]\n\nL-76 Way back in Moses' time, it was still Christ. See? He is the only One has Eternal Life. See?\n\nL-77 \"Esteeming the reproach,\" to be called a fanatic, holy-roller, or something like that, you know. See? Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of... reward.\n\nL-78 Now you know what that means? It means this, that, Moses was borned a poor boy, real poor. His father's name 65-1031A, Leadership, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 56 min was Amram. His mother's name was Jochebed. And they were real poor, but they were Christians. They worked hard. They was in slavery. They had to make mud bricks, and things, for the old king. You know what? That king's daughter went down, one day, to the river where mother...\n\nL-79 Moses' mother, Jochebed, had taken him and put him in a little raft out on the river like that. And the old crocodiles had eaten up all the little babies; and they were killing them, throwing them out into the river. But she put him right out there. And you know how she got them crocodiles away from him? She made this little--little ark she put him in, she made it out of pitch. You know what that is? It's turpentine. An old 'gator would come up, say, \"Hum, a little fat Hebrew, I'll get him!\" Hear him crying like that. Went over there, \"Whew! What a smell! Uh!\" See? See, the mother was led, how to protect her baby. So he backed off from it, he didn't want nothing to do with that. [Exodus 2:1-10]\n\nL-80 And then he went on down the river, a little farther. And his little sister, named Miriam, followed him down the river, watched what...\n\nL-81 And then Pharaoh's daughter come out and was going to get him, you know, and she pulled him out. You know, all... You know, your mother thinks you're the prettiest child in the world; see, she should do that. But the Bible said this little boy was really pretty, really a fair little boy. And, oh, he was just screaming and kicking his little heels. He was missing his mama, see. And so you know what happened? Then God put in Pharaoh's daughter, the king's daughter, all the love that a mother could have for a little baby. Her heart just fell for him. She said, \"That's my baby.\" [Exodus 2:1-10] But, you know, she was a young woman. See, them days they didn't have these bottles that you, the babies, was raised on, so they had to go get a mother that was, had had a baby, and had, that could nurse.\n\nL-82 So Miriam was right there on hand, she said, \"I'll go get you the right mother.\"\"Well, you go get her.\" [Exodus 2:5-7] You know who Miriam went and got? Moses' own mother. That's right. Yeah, went and got. That was wisdom, wasn't it? And so then went and got Moses' own mother. And she said, \"I'll take and raise the little boy for you.\" She said, \"You know what, I'm going to give you three hundred dollars, a week, to raise that baby. And you can stay in the palace.\" See how God does when you trust Him, see, when you're sure of faith. That baby was a prophet, see, and she knowed. So they went into the palace and--and she raised Moses, and the mother, the own mother, and got three hundred dollars, a week, to take care of everything. Just think of that!\n\nL-83 And then, you know, after a while, after that went on for a little while, Moses begin to get old enough to read and write. She taught him how to read and write. And then she told him, said, \"Moses, you are borned a correct child. Your father and I have prayed. God has revealed to us that you're a prophet, and you're going to be a deliverer of the people, in the days that is to come.\" [Exodus 2:9-10] And you know, when he got big, then what was he? He was adopted into the king's family. Oh, my! He didn't have to...\n\nL-84 And he looked out on his own people, and they didn't have no clothes. They were Christians, and they were crying. And them old taskmasters whipping them with whips, and the blood fly out of their back. His--his cousins and uncles, papa and mama, all of them; whipping them with whips, out there in them mud pits. And so, but Moses, being something way down in his heart, he knew that they were God's promised people. He knew it.\n\nL-85 Now, the next thing he was going to do was to become king. He would be king over everything, a rich man, my, all the money of Egypt. And Egypt controlled the world, at that time. But, look, the Bible said, \"he esteemed the reproach,\" to be a mud dauber like out there, a Christian. When they made fun of them, and laughed at them, kicked them. If they said anything back, they killed them. See? But Moses chose to go with that group instead of being called the king's son. [Hebrews 11:23-28]\n\nL-86 Look at that! See, because he seen the end time! See that rich young man? But he seen Jesus, like we see Him in a vision, that the end time is what is going to pay. Now, and he accepted Christ's leadership, and Moses esteemed the reproach greater treasures. [Hebrews 11:26] 65-1031A, Leadership, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 56 min\n\nL-87 You know, sometime when you little boys in school, little boys will say bad words and they want you all to say them. You little girls, little girls will say bad things and want you all to say them. You say, \"No. I'm a Christian.\" They say, \"Ah, you big sissy!\" You know, go onto you like that. See, stand up, say, \"I'm glad to be that.\" See? Cause, see, that's what Moses did. He esteemed the reproach of Christ greater treasures than all of Egypt. Now let us follow him, led by Christ, and see what he did. [Hebrews 11:26]\n\nL-88 Now, see, this young man was rich, the first young man, but he didn't want Christ. He didn't want to be a follower of Jesus. And so we find him very popular, perhaps become a movie star, and great everything, in all the--the things that he could do, and everything he wanted. But when he died, he didn't have anybody to lead him. So, his education, that was good; his money, that was good; but when death come, that was all, he couldn't use it no more. He couldn't buy his way up to Heaven. And he couldn't, by his education, he couldn't go to Heaven. See?\n\nL-89 But this young man now, he had all these things. He had education, too. He's smart. He went to school, and his mother taught him, and--and he had a good education. And he was real smart, till, even he could teach the Egyptians. He taught his teacher, he was so smart. Look how smart he was. But, you know what, above all that smartness, above all that he had, the potentials he had, he still said, \"I'll forsake it all, to follow Jesus.\" You know what they done with him? They run him out. He become a--a mud slave like the rest of them.\n\nL-90 But one day when he become a grown man, he was herding sheep on the back side of the desert. And what happened? Anybody tell me what happened? What was it? [A child says, \"There was a Fire in the bush.\"--Ed.] That's right, there was a Fire in the bush, and It attracted his attention. He turned aside. And you know what? [Exodus 3:3-4]\n\nL-91 Instead of teaching children, now the children are going to get up and teach me. [Brother Branham laughs--Ed.] So, and this little boy here, he is right on the--right on the mark. Who is your daddy? [The child says, \"Mr. Shantz.\"] Mr. Shantz is your daddy. That boy has been taught, hasn't he? Each one of them little bright eyes looking the same way, one to get ahead of the other one, you see. So now look, he did, and that--and that--that bush attracted him, on fire, and he said, \"I will turn aside and see what it is.\"\n\nL-92 And God said to Moses, \"Take off your shoes, the ground you're standing on is holy. I have chosen you to go down and deliver My people. I'm giving you power; you can smite the earth with plagues, you can turn the water into blood, you can bring fleas and lice. Nothing is going to harm you. I choose you.\" Why? Because he chose Christ. See? You choose Christ, and He chooses you. See? Now He said, \"You chose Me, and I have chose you to go down there in Egypt.\" [Exodus 3:5]\n\nL-93 And look what he done. He led two million people, two million people out, his people, and brought them into the promised land. And, now, he followed. We follow him all through the wilderness; and you children has heard Brother Leo and Brother Gene, and your papa and mama, tell you what all taken place in the wilderness, how he brought bread down out of heaven and fed the hungry people, and all these things. And now we find out, he is an old man now, he's real old, he is one hundred and twenty years old. And he is in the wilderness.\n\nL-94 And the people didn't treat him nice, even. See, sometimes people that call themselves Christians don't treat you nice. But Jesus always treats you right. See? See? So we find now that the people rebelled against him, but he stayed right with them, anyhow. And he was the leader, and he had to stay with them. And the Angels of the Lord talked to him. Wouldn't you love to have that happen to you? Then make the right choice, and choose Jesus, and He'll do it.\n\nL-95 Now, then we find out, the end of the road, he got real old. He couldn't preach no more, and his voice got low. So he blessed Joshua, and went up on top the hill, to die.\n\nL-96 You know what happened when he died? There, what, what happened? [A boy says, \"He died, and then He raised him from the dead.\"--Ed.] That's exactly right. That's exactly right. Now you say, \"Where is that at?\"\n\nL-97 Now, just a minute, the boy is right, see. He was raised up from the dead. Now, and...?... See? See? Now look. He 65-1031A, Leadership, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 56 min raised him up from the dead. Why? Because, eight hundred years later, here he was over in Palestine, standing with his Leader yet, Jesus, who esteemed the reproach of His Name greater treasures than all the riches of Egypt. He esteemed... His Leader was standing there. You know, He was called... [Matthew 17:1-3], [Mark 9:1-5]\n\nL-98 In the--in the Bible, you know, there was a Rock that went with Israel. And when Moses got ready to die, he stepped up on this Rock. And that Rock was Jesus. You remember when Jesus was talking, in--in St. John, the 6th chapter? Well, he said, \"Our fathers eat manna in the wilderness!\"\n\nL-99 Said, said, \"My Father gave you that manna.\" He said, \"Yeah, they eat manna. That's right. And they're, every one, dead, because they wouldn't keep on going on, see.\" Said, \"They're, every one, dead.\" But said, \"I am the Bread of Life that come from God out of Heaven.\" [John 6:31]\n\nL-100 \"Our fathers drank from a Rock. Moses smote the Rock,\" and said, \"and the waters came forth.\" He said, \"I am that Rock that was with him.\"\n\nL-101 And look, when Moses died, he stepped onto that Rock. You know what happened? The Bible said that \"Angels\" come and got him. What a difference from that other young man! That young man, see, when he died, he didn't have nobody to hold him, so he just sank down through the darkness, into hell, and he's there now, there. Then when Moses stepped out of life, when he went, he had took a Leader. His mama led him right, his father taught him right. And then when he got to be of age, a young man, then he said, \"I see Eternal Life, if I will go down with these poor, neglected people, and walk with them, because they are God's people. I don't have to. I could be a king, but I don't want to be a king. I can have all the money there is in Egypt, 'cause I'm going to be owner of it. I don't want it. I would rather walk with Jesus,\" and then when he walked through life. And then when he started to step out of life, there was his Leader that takes him by hand. [Hebrews 11:24-26]\n\nL-102 Don't you want that Leader? Don't we all want that Leader to hold him by His hand? Hundreds of years later, he was seen with his great Leader. He had led. He made the--he made the choice, of his youth, and so therefore God was holding him.\n\nL-103 You know what? The rich man is in hell, that one young rich man that refused. See, now remember, he had education, he had religion, he went to church, he was a good man, but he refused Jesus. See? [Luke 16:22, 23]\n\nL-104 And this young man, he was educated, and he had religion, but he wanted Jesus. See, Moses would have been a much richer man than--than this young fellow would have been, 'cause he just had some money, probably farms and things like that, and maybe politics and so forth, but Moses was to be king over the earth. And he forsook all of that.\n\nL-105 And you know what, children? When there is no Egypt, and when there is no treasures, there will still be a Moses, because he chose the right thing. See? He chose the right thing to lead him.\n\nL-106 When there is no more big pyramids! You read about the pyramids in Egypt? One of these days, they'll be dust, under the atomic bomb. All the riches of the world, people will throw it in the air, and scream, and say it's cankered into their flesh, and scream and howl. See, it will pass away.\n\nL-107 But them who accept Jesus to lead them, they'll never die. They have Eternal Life. Though they die naturally here, Jesus will raise them up again.\n\nL-108 You must make a choice. Your choice will determine what your eternal destination will be. Remember, Jesus asks each one of us, \"Follow Me if you want Life.\" See, leadership, \"Follow Me. You'll have everlasting Life.\" And I'm sure, even to us adults, we get something out of this, too. If you want Life, you have to accept It. You want religion, you accept it. If you want... What you have to do, what you accept, that's what you'll get. But to me and to you, and to these little children, remember, you have an invitation. Jesus said, \"Follow Me, and have Eternal Life.\" That's what we want to do, don't we? [Matthew 8:22], [Luke 9:23-25], [Mark 10:21-25]\n\nL-109 Now how many of you wants to really follow Jesus, and you say, \"Well, well, when I get big enough and old 65-1031A, Leadership, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 56 min enough to make my choice, and to do what... I don't care how much money I got, how poor I am, how much people laugh at me, or everything else, I want to follow Jesus. I want to make Moses' choice, not the rich young man\"? How many wants to do that right here? Now you really want to do it?\n\nL-110 I want you to stand up with me. I want you to put your left hand on your heart, and you hold your right hand up. I want you to close your eyes now and bow your head, and just say these words after me. [The congregation repeats each phrase after Brother Branham, in the following prayer--Ed.]\n\nL-111 Dear Jesus, [\"Dear Jesus,\"] I pledge my life to You. [\"I pledge my life to You.\"] I have heard this sermon, [\"I have heard this sermon,\"] where two young men made their choice. [\"where two young men made their choice.\"] I do not want to go the way of the rich young ruler. [\"I do not want to go the way of the rich young ruler.\"] But I do want to go the way of Moses. [\"But I do want to go the way of Moses.\"] I am just a child, yet. [\"I am just a child, yet.\"] Lead me, Dear Jesus, [\"Lead me, Dear Jesus,\"] to Eternal Life. [\"to Eternal Life.\"] Amen. [\"Amen.\"] Now you bow your head.\n\nL-112 Dear Jesus, one day, in Your pilgrimage here on earth, they brought to You such little fellows as I have been speaking to this afternoon. And the disciples said, \"The Master is too tired. He preached this morning. He preached, this and that, and He is too tired. Don't trouble Him.\" But, Jesus, You said, \"Suffer the little children to come to Me, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.\" [Matthew 19:14]\n\nL-113 Lord God, today receive these little boys and girls here, in this school of righteousness, here where our brother has come apart into the side of the wilderness here, to bring out the families that desire to separate themselves from the things of the world, to sojourn only for You. And now their little ones are here, watching the lives of their father and mother, as we--we are examples in all that we do. O Dear God, Creator of Heavens and earth, guide our feet, Lord, that we'll not do nothing before these little ones, that would put a stumbling block in their way. For it is said, it would be better that we have a millstone tied at our neck, and be cast into the sea, than to offend one of these little ones. You said, \"Their Angels always behold My Father's face which is in Heaven,\" the great Angel, and guardian Angel, over each of these little souls.\n\nL-114 As they sat this afternoon with their little eyes wide open, looking and answering the questions, and listening at the little baby stories of the Bible, of how these two young man took their choices, and each one of them dedicating their lives to You. O Jehovah God, lead them, protect them. And may they find this great Leader, Jesus Christ, that will lead them when father and mother and the teachers are finished with them. May You lead them to Eternal Life, as You did to Moses, as their humble, little, child prayer went to You. I give them to You, Lord, as Your servant, as trophies and gems for Your crown. Use them, Lord, to honor You, on earth. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-115 And you little ones, fellows, can... Now you feel better about it now? You know Jesus is going to lead you and guide you. Don't you believe that? And Jesus is going to make you little boys just like Moses and Miriam, the prophetess and the prophet, going to make great people out of you.\n\nL-116 Now, we older people, that have accepted Him, don't we want Him to lead us on, too? I want Him to lead me on, guide my feet, hold my hand. See? And even when I come down to the river, I--I want to have a hold of His hand. We all want that, don't we?\n\nL-117 Dear Jesus, lead us, too, Father. Now we're fixing to separate from each other. I must go back to Tucson. I must get ready for the meetings coming. God, I commit this group of people, Brother Leo and Brother Gene, and all the followers here, into Your hands, that You will bless them and love them, forgiving all their iniquities, healing all of their diseases, keeping them ever in love and fellowship, and encouraging those who would have... be get weary. And sometime Satan might come along and cause them to be discouraged, but, remember, You went through the same thing, discouragement, forsaken by--by men of this earth, and people. And sometimes very dearest of friends, even to relationships, we're forsaken. But there is One that we have chosen, He will never leave us or forsake us.\n\nL-118 Lead us, Lord, to Life Eternal. I pray that You will grant that we can come together many more times, on earth, and speak of Thee and talk of Thee. And then in that great Day, when the world is finished and all the time has faded 65-1031A, Leadership, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 56 min into Eternity, may we meet in that great Kingdom, as unbroken families, to live together hereafter forever. Grant it, Lord. Until then, may we work, labor with all of our might, while the sun is still shining. For we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-119 God bless each one of you. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] By His counsel guide, uphold you, With His arms securely fold you; God be with you till we meet again! Till we meet! till we meet! Till we meet at Jesus' feet; Till we meet! till we meet! (Thank you, brother.) God be with you till we meet again! God bless you all. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

[Brother Branham and congregation hum Only Believe--Ed.]\n\nL-2 It would be kind of hard for anyone to express themselves in a--in a time like this, to say how much I appreciate this privilege of being here this morning, and--and among you, to minister the Word of God, which I'm sure you are acquainted with. And--and I want to thank Brother Leo and Brother Gene, and all you people, for this grand opportunity.\n\nL-3 And as I was hearing the--the first hymn, to the last, there is something about that singing, it's a worship that you just don't find no more. And is always a great privilege for me when I come up here, about once a year, or twice, to get to just fill yourself up with that goodness of them songs.\n\nL-4 And I was thinking this morning, when Brother Leo announced the song of They Come From The East And West, and about my wife singing that when I left to... left her and--and Billy and Rebekah, to start this great revival, of a spearhead of it, rather, as it swept the nations. And then was thinking, as I looked across this pretty, clean-looking bunch of ladies. I remember Meda then was one of them, she was a little black-headed girl. And now she is like myself, we're getting old and gray, and our times are running out. And yet with this grand Hope, that we'll be gathered together again in Him, where there will be no more time, old age, nothing to hinder us or bother us.\n\nL-5 I don't believe that I know any place that I have ever seen in my life, especially with this many people, where there was so many nice Christians with this love. Don't never let that die among you. Just remember.\n\nL-6 I used to have a little... the saying amongst the people. My wife's name was Hope; my first wife, Billy's mother. They used to... There was three of us then, that was Hope, and myself, and Billy. They used to call us, \"Hope, faith, and charity.\" And so seemed to have a burly faith, like, in those days, to believe that this Word was true; and, what God had promised, He would do.\n\nL-7 And, but, you see, \"The greatest of this is charity, is love.\" Like Brother Leo expressed this morning. \"Love! Where there is tongues, it shall cease. Where there is prophesies, it'll fail. But when charity, which is love, it always will endure.\" See?Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious WordShall never lose Its Power,Till all the ransomed Church of GodBe saved to sin no more.Ever since by faith I saw the streamThy flowing wounds supply,Redeeming love has been my theme,And shall be till I die. [I Corinthians 13:8] I think there is nothing greater than love. And love, if we can't express it... Now, we can say that we have love, we're just saying that. But when we can really express what we've said that we have, then we show it in ourselves.\n\nL-8 Now we're not a perfect people. We make our mistakes. We do things that's wrong. But, you see, love covers all of that. We're willing, when we see our mistakes, to come back and apologize to one another. Yeah, that's--that's warriors. That's, that is really men and women that's gallant. Any man can go out to the battlefield, that's got nerve enough to walk out there; but when he gets knocked down, then get up and try it again, see. There used to be a song that a young man and young woman used to sing in the church, \"If I fall or if I fail,\" see, \"if I fall or if I...\" I forget how it goes. \"Let me rise and try again.\"Forgive me, Lord, and try me one more time. (See? See?)If I fall or if I sin, let me rise and try again.Just forgive me, Lord, and try me one more time. [I Peter 4:8]\n\nL-9 And with as many as a hundred and twenty people here together, you are bound to--to find things sometimes, the enemy will sweep in among you, and through your minds, and--and start this, that. Just stop when he does it. Think 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min back, think of this morning, think of the times when you're sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. [Ephesians 2:6]\n\nL-10 Some of you are plumbers and some are carpenters and some this, that, and the other. You rub arms with the world each day, when you're out there. But when you see those things, and great temptations rise, just remember these little, sacred places where you're sitting together, with the only thing that lasts. Your jobs will fail, one of these days. Your health will fail. Even your life, here on earth, will fail. But then That won't fail. And if He is the center of all things, then let's keep your minds on the center Post, what has drawed us to this.\n\nL-11 My, this nice, clean-looking bunch of people! I don't mean so much your clothes. Your clothes are clean, of course, and things, your faces. I think these little ladies here, not a speck of lipstick on a one of them; all of them with long hair, young and old, middle-age and all. Yes. See? Well, you just don't realize what a treasure you got here, see, in this little chapel service.\n\nL-12 I want to thank Brother and Sister Shantz, also, and for this privilege of being in their home. And this is their home now, that they have sold their property, I think, in Canada, and have come down to sojourn with us. We don't have no more earthly possessions. We're seeking a City to come, Whose Builder and Maker is God. [Hebrews 11:10]\n\nL-13 And I thank Brother Leo and Gene, for the trueness they have been, to the vision that was given to them when we first met. No doubt but what he has told you many times. It's strange, I didn't see it just like this. I knew there was something ahead. When the young fellow came to me as a... with a dream that he had had of a pyramid, standing up in this pyramid. And he climbed up to where I was at, and I was standing out in a saucer, a plate, or something like a light. He said, \"Brother Branham, how you get up there?\"\n\nL-14 And I said, \"Brother Leo, God has to put a person in this position up here.\" I said, \"Now that you've seen, return back to the people and tell them that you believe it's of God.\" And little knowing then when I had a place. I--I love the boys, and I wanted to put them in a position where I could be with them. And they started making tapes. But, you see, as far as myself, they'd have still been making tapes, as far as I know. But what a greater thing God has did for them, than to make tapes, see. Most anybody can make a tape, that's got the intelligence to turn on a tape recorder, or can sell. But it takes guidance of the Holy Spirit to guide a little group together like this, this morning, and keep them together in harmony and unity, and still clinging to the Message.\n\nL-15 God, may You--may You grant, to this people, long life here on earth, happiness and joy, and then \"enter into the joys of the Lord\" at the end of the road.\n\nL-16 We are now ready for a battle, the Trumpet is to sound. The hymns have been sang, now comes the Word. I think, as I stand here, that you know... Yes, you probably do.\n\nL-17 But to hear these comments of these young soldiers here! And myself getting old, and listen around, and your faith and confidence, and what you've placed in to believe the Message that--that I have been given of God. Now, if it wasn't for you all, the Message would do no good. See, it's--it's got to be somebody to believe It. And as long as It's coming from God, there is going to be somebody believe It, you see. God has made a way. He, He has affixed His great economy like that, that, when He sends forth Something, there is something there to meet that Something. The Deep responds to the call of the deep. It's--it's got to be that way. [Psalms 42:7]\n\nL-18 I like the word that Brother Gene used in prayer this morning, \"In His august courts.\" I feel that way when I cross that bridge down there, to--to come in where God is reverenced and respected. And always keep it that way. No matter when the enemy...\n\nL-19 Now remember, don't forget this; Brother Leo and Gene, especially. Now, you think Satan is going to let this go on like this, without a hinderance? Oh, no. He sure won't. He is going to fly in, one of these days, just like a whirlwind. But when the--when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of God raises a standard against it. Just keep lifting yourself up in prayer before God. Cling to one another. Hold to God. For, if you love one another, it shows you love God. \"This will all men know, that you're My disciples, when you have love one for the other.\" [Isaiah 59:19], [John 13:35] 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min\n\nL-20 And I thought, a while ago, \"What beautiful singing! What fine voices! What a fine group of men and women, husbands and wives; young, old, and middle-age, sitting together here.\" I thought, \"Well, they ought to have it down in Prescott, they ought to be down there and ought to have a little radio broadcast like that.\" Then, you see, that wouldn't be just exactly what God has called these young men to do. See? See? The Bride is being called out, see, called out, now my work is out here, to call. And then things like this, and where you colonize yourselves together, and holds himself, where you want to bring up your children, each one watching each day, like the eye of an eagle watching over their young, so that you won't... If you see anything wrong, then you call that person aside and pray over it, and things like that. Keep it pure, holy, so the Holy Spirit can have a place to visit.\n\nL-21 God likes to be worshiped. And when you worship Him, it just isn't exactly singing a song as we do, but singing it in the spirit of worship, you see, then you feel the Holy Spirit bounce back.\n\nL-22 And I see great big young man here, just think of the day that group of young fellows sitting there, young boys and their little wives sitting along here, and big, rough man sitting there and just cry like little babies. Why, look at today, they're out here on the street, living in adultery and filth of the world, and things.\n\nL-23 And to think that you can come apart and gather like this, where as the Psalmist said, \"Behold how sweet and pleasant for brethren to dwell together in unity.\" It's like the anointing oil that was on Aaron's beard, that ran to the hems of his garments. Which, that anointing oil... Which, you know what the anointing oil done, it preserved him to go in the Presence of God. See, he had to be anointed with that oil before he went in the Presence of God. And when brethren can dwell together in unity, it's likened unto that oil. We then enter into the Presence of the Lord, with that anointing of brethren together in unity. Oil represents the \"Holy Spirit.\" [Psalms 133:1-2]\n\nL-24 Now can we have just a word of prayer before entering into the study of the Word. Heavenly Father, as our brother has expressed this morning, the entering into the august courts of the Lord! Now, Father, we realize this group of people here, and now what I say, I'll have to answer for at the Day of the Judgment. And this is Your children. Bless them, Father, continually. Bless Brother Leo and Brother Gene. May they be led by Your Holy Spirit, to guide these people, as we make this pilgrimage to the sunset. And then, O Holy Ghost of God, guide us to the Son. Grant it, Lord. Break the Bread of Life to us, through the Word. And we're... Now we realize that we're in battle now. We're putting on pieces of armour, out here on these soldiers, which they'll have to fight with, in the hours that is left in life. And I pray, Lord, that You will rightly place every piece where it belongs, where they can be shielded against the--the enemy whenever he comes against them. Grant it, Lord. We pray in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-25 Now, I'm rather slow in--in speaking, because I'm--I'm not a trained minister. I know there is people here that's smart, intelligent, intellectual, and have laid that aside, to come over now and to break themselves down, in humility. Great Paul, the apostle, I think of his words when he said that, \"I did not come to you with the enticing words of man, because there you would place your faith in that, but I come to you in the power of the Spirit.\" See, the great things that he knew he had, he laid aside. And I feel this morning, like man here, like Brother Hughy and sister, teacher here from the mission fields, and many of you people who are really intelligent and smart; and I--I feel very little to stand here with no more education than I have, before you. But I... And then to see that you people, like that, would--would humble yourselves to them things, lay it aside, and sit down and listen to a person that hardly knows their ABC'S, that makes great people out of you. It isn't he that can stick his shoulders out, and walk out and... It's he that can humble himself. [I Corinthians 2:4]\n\nL-26 I think, character, it's measured by... man, not by the muscles on his arm or by the callouses in his hands, but the bag in the knees of his trousers where he has prayed. I think that's what makes man.\n\nL-27 Now I want to read, this morning, some of the Bible. And I like the Word. Don't you? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now we've worshiped the Lord, and we'll continue to worship Him. Now let's worship Him as a--a cutting sharp-edged Sword, as It moves through us, to find out where we're standing. And--and I--I say It, because this is one place I feel that I could--could teach the things that I want to say this morning. 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min And then, course, Brother Leo and Gene, and them, will--will exercise upon them, when we leave, and will bring the points out as I heard him so graciously mention in his message this morning. That, he catches that. But you can't say it from the platform like this or on them tapes, but, see, just sit down and study them. Just keep studying them, over and over. It's hard to understand. So many people misunderstand It! And did you know, little--little flock, it is--it is that way amongst all humans? It always has been.\n\nL-28 If they could not understand our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, (even His apostles, see) then how could we expect to understand It in this day, you see. He said, He would say things that is straight, you know, and He wouldn't explain them. He would just say them. Said, like for instance, \"Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink His Blood, you have no Life in you.\" [John 6:53]\n\nL-29 Now what, now what if a--what if a doctor had been standing close, or a nurse or something, in that congregation, that day, He was talking to? Well, they said, \"This Man is a vampire, see, wants to drink His Blood.\" See, He never explained it. He just said it. But later on, Paul came along and explained it out, how it was taking communion, you know, \"eating His Flesh and drinking His Blood.\" And so He just said those things. [I Corinthians 11:24-26]\n\nL-30 And finally, at last, the apostles one day, even after the resurrection, there was one was leaning upon His shoulder, John He loved. He was a young man. And He said, \"What is it to you if this man tarries till I come?\" There went out a saying among them, that John wasn't going to--going to die till Jesus returned. Jesus did not say that. He just, what He said, \"What is it to you if he does tarry?\" And then, of course, you read in--in a word, how that--that God then... That was said for a purpose. These things are all for a purpose. God took that young John and lift him up in the Spirit, and saw His Coming, plumb over into the--the age that is to come. See, said, \"What is it to you if he tarries?\" He didn't tarry him, physical; but--but the Word that He spoke through him, it's brought us to this age where we are now, you see. So, it all works together for good. [John 21:21-22]\n\nL-31 In Romans, a very familiar chapter, I want to take a--a few verses here, and about the first two or three verses, two verses, I think it is, and read. And, in this, try to explain It the best that I know how, by the help of the Holy Spirit. Romans, the 12th chapter. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. [Romans 12:1-2]\n\nL-32 I thought that was so beautiful for this group this morning, what you done did. Now, \"And,\" and is a conjunction, as I understand.And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. [Romans 12:1-2]\n\nL-33 That's what we all want to do, is, \"Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our mind, to do the perfect and acceptable will of God.\" Now that we have been saved, as we are; and that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit, as we have; now we want the mind that was in Christ, to be in us, that we might be transformed from the natural things of life, and be brought in to do the perfect will of God, by transformation, of God's Spirit, by His Word. Now my subject is: The Power Of Transformation. [Romans 12:1-2]\n\nL-34 I may leave my Bible here. Now, it used to be, years ago, when I was a young man like these man, I--I didn't have to set down my Scriptures and--and things when I was studying. But now since I am getting old, why, I carry me a little book. And--and when I get something, why, I jot it down, have to put it on the Scripture. And used to, I just had that line of Scriptures right in my mind, I just come right down.\n\nL-35 But, dear friends, I'm not young like you all, this morning. But I am old, and I have been through many hard battles, see; and, by going through those hard battles, brings you where you are this morning. See? So, I'm sure you understand that. God has put me through it, that my life might open up a way, to say \"this is It, see,\" then you all run over that road. But before me, there was someone opened up the way for me to go. See? And we open up the road, one for the other. And as you see, sometime, an old veteran getting old, and his marks all over him, and as Paul said one time, \"I bear in my body the marks of Jesus Christ.\" You see? How Timothy looked upon those marks, I guess, with 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min reverence, as he commit it to young Timothy. [Galatians 6:17]\n\nL-36 Now, \"transforming.\" I used to work for a Public Service Company, where we had transformers, and to transform. Now the word is, the word means, in itself, something like... To transform, means \"something that's been changed, something that's changed from one thing to another.\"\n\nL-37 And as I want to speak, for the next forty-five minutes or an hour, on--on the transforming, I would like to--to use this text. And I--I may say some things, in here, that seems very strange. And as Brother Leo had just said, \"Take It and just study over It, a little while.\" See, just think of It for a little bit. To be transformed is to be \"changed and made something different.\"\n\nL-38 Like a--a tadpole, it's transformed from a tadpole to a frog. See, once, he looked like a catfish, he swims around, he's--he's got a head and his tail, and everything looks just like a--a catfish. Then, after a while, he begins to lose, he loses the tail, and he's--he's transformed from one specie to another.\n\nL-39 I think that's what Paul must have had in mind, when he said, \"Be ye transformed by the--by the renewing.\" Let's see, let me get that right. \"And be not conformed,\" you know what conformed is. ... be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,... [Romans 12:1-2]\n\nL-40 \"Renewing of your mind.\" The things that you once thought upon, to be precious, lay that aside and be transformed to something else; what you was one time, to what you are now. See? ... by the renewing of your mind, that you might prove... that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. [Romans 12:1-2]\n\nL-41 Oh, that's what we all want to know, how to do it. See? We are here, we love Him; He saved us, now we want to know what to do. And we're trying to take a little step this morning, to raise up just a little bit higher. Sometimes we have to hit things that... You just hold on for a few... till we see what it comes out to be.\n\nL-42 Now in Genesis, the 1st chapter, \"The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\" We realize that the water... And--and the Bible said, \"In the beginning back there,\" that, this, \"the world was without form, and was void.\" There was nothing but just a darkness of chaos. And--and what a horrible shape it must have been in. Nothing but way into the darkness yonder, without light or anything, and the churning of the water, and that wandering star twisted around and around the orbits out there somewhere. It must have been a--a terrific mass of--of--of something lost, like it was, couldn't find its way. [Genesis 1:1-3]\n\nL-43 And that's what we become when we become wandering stars, away from God, just without hope, without God; without, just churning around, out in darkness, not knowing when we... where we're going. And God took that great chaos of darkness, and transformed it into a garden of Eden, see, by His Word. That's how we're transformed, by God's Word. When God said, \"Let there be light,\" and that mass of creation out there come over in around the sun, and begin to revolve around the sun, and became a garden of Eden because it obeyed the Word of God. It done the perfect will of God, for it was transformed from chaos, into a garden of Eden, by the Word of God. [Genesis 1:3-5]\n\nL-44 Now that's what we are here for. That's my Message, has been all along, is the Word of God. We must hold to That regardless of what other things take place. Always stay with that Word. Always check out your motives and objectives, if it is according to the Word of God. If it isn't, leave it alone. See? But if it's with the Word of God, and lines up with the Word of God, then, that, you hold to that.\n\nL-45 Now God sometimes... Just like your little group here this morning. He lets it not happen just overnight, He lets, God... We're the one that gets in a hurry. God is never in a hurry. He just says it, and--and it's going to be. For, when He says anything, it's got to be. It's just going to be! He, He lets it take its time. He let...\n\nL-46 The Hebrew children, them famous characters of the Scripture, that was standing on God's Word to be true, they said, \"Our God is able to deliver us from this fiery furnace. Nevertheless, see, we won't bow to the image, because it's against the Word, see. Although, if He slays us, He'll raise us up again, you see.\" See, and they... He let them walk right up to the edge of this great furnace, and drop into it, before it seemed like He even paid any attention, like He 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min wasn't even watching them. But He is always watching, though. He is always watching for this. [Daniel 3:17-18]\n\nL-47 Now God said, \"Let there be light.\" And six thousand years it took this Eden to come into existence, and we are taught in the Scripture, \"For one day upon the earth is... or--or--or is a thousand years, with God; a thousand years upon the earth, is one day with God.\" So it took six thousand years to make this earth, and to bring it into an Eden. But, you see, it was God, the great Master of all intelligence, and He--He had in His mind what He wanted to do. [Genesis 1:3], [II Peter 3:8]\n\nL-48 Just like when the man that built this trailer, when the man that... When you brethren here that designed this park, how you would make it, it was in your mind, you kept working that vision out. That's the way God did about the world. He worked; it was in His mind. And, if you notice, it come like by evolution, like He was learning more all the time, making something greater and greater. But, see, He was above it all, and just let it evolute up to that, you see. Everything He begin to bring upon the earth, from botany life, and fish, and so forth; it come on into birds, and the animals; and then something in His Own image, a man; and stopped there, see, because it was up to His perfection, of what He wanted. [Genesis 1:11-27] That's the way you start, like this trailer. You might lay the frame down, and you say, \"What are you doing?\" Like you, when you all moved the first rocks away from this corner here. \"What are you doing?\" See, it didn't look like it would be like it is now. It looks like a little Eden, because it was in your mind what to do, and you just kept working up.\n\nL-49 Now we want to be transformed, ourselves, by the renewing of our mind. See, not what we have on this earth, what we are going to look for on this earth; but what we are coming to, in the world that is to come. Transformed by renewing of our mind! [Romans 12:2]\n\nL-50 Now, six thousand years, God taken to make this, and we see in Genesis 1. Yet, now we see that, in this, God had a--had an objective that He wanted to bring to pass. And so many people, in teaching on Genesis, back here in the 1st chapter and the 2nd chapter, and 3rd chapter, especially, \"It looks like that God repeats Himself. Oh, He says, He went ahead and said all these things that He did. Oh, how He... 'Let there be light, and let there be this, and let there come forth,' and there wasn't even one thing yet.\" Wasn't nothing. There wasn't a light. That--that old world was still floating out there in that darkness, covered over with water. But, see, He had spoke His Word, and then that's when He was speaking.\n\nL-51 Now we notice here in Genesis 1, He said, \"And He formed man in His Own image, in His Own likeness, in the image of God made He (He made) him, male and female.\" See, He was making man, He just spoke the Word. Then we find out, after His many days had passed, maybe hundreds and hundreds of years, there was still no man to till the soil. Nobody to till the soil, so then God formed man out of the dust of the earth. See, He had spoke the Word, and then the Word had to take place. [Genesis 1:27], [Genesis 2:5-7] Now, when He said, \"Let there be light.\" Maybe there might have been hundreds of years, maybe eight hundred years, before there ever was a light, but it come to pass because God said so.\n\nL-52 And God is going to have a Church, I don't care how many dark ages we go through, and whatever more. He is going to have a Church without spot or wrinkle, whether we are part of it or not, because He has already said it was going to happen. It's going to be there. And--and He commanded, to--to transform it into the plant life and every life that He put forth. He said these words, like, \"Let there be a palm tree. And let there be an oak tree. Let there be a fir.\" Look down in the desert, where we live down here in Tucson. Out on there, there is cactus, jumping cactus, all kinds of cactuses. Just thirty minutes from there, is sherman pine up on top of the mountain. Now, this cactus will not grow up there, and neither will that sherman pine grow down here. Now, where was the Intelligence that planted the seed? See, they had to come from somewhere. It was God's Word, \"Let there be,\" and it was.\n\nL-53 Now we find out, all this, after He had made it, transforming it into its kind and its life, and--and it was all put in by the Word of God, the Creator. It all, we find out, that this all headed-up in a headquarters, called the garden of Eden. And God put His son, and His son's bride, over it all. See? This great creation, see, He had a reason for it. He made everything so pretty! He made the flowers, and the life, and the birds; and there was no death, no sin, no sorrow, no 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min sickness. And then all this great thing headed-up into one big headquarters, which was the garden of Eden. [Genesis 2:5-9]\n\nL-54 And there He put His son, Adam, and Adam's bride, wife. Now you might say, \"It was his wife.\" Potentially it was his wife, but he had never... never really been his wife yet. Like in the Scripture, we find out, where It said, \"Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.\" See? Now it was his wife when he made the promise to marry her, or to have her; but yet it wasn't his wife, yet, because he had never knew her as a wife. [Matthew 1:20] So that's the way it was here, the reason I said, \"God's son and his bride.\" Adam had never knew his wife as a wife, but yet it was his wife, potentially. Just like the Church now, and Christ.\n\nL-55 Now, then, all could rest, because all of God's good Word seeds, that He had spoke, had brought forth of its kind. The earth come over, there was light. There was sunshine when He let the sun shine. Now why did He make the sun shine? He had in His mind, see, that, if the sun don't shine, the flower won't grow, that He speak into existence. He makes everything to meet its purpose, whatever it is. Like a tree, it bears a certain acorn, or it bears an apple. He makes the fruit of the garden, and so forth. It's all for His purpose. And everything had come to pass, and He had spoke it. Now the only thing He had to do, after spoken it, He... speaking it, rather. He could go to rest, because He had spoke it, and it was all has to come to pass because He had spoke it. I don't know how much it had to go through before it come to pass, how many rejects and whatever more. But it had to come to pass, because He said it would come to pass. He had spoke it.\n\nL-56 The same thing it is about having a Church here in the last days. He is going to have a Bride. \"He is able of these stones to rise children to Abraham.\" If we don't follow Him, He'll get somebody else that will follow Him. See? He is going to have It, because He has already spoke it. Whatever He says, it has to be that way. It cannot change. It must come forth that way, because He said it would. [Matthew 3:9]\n\nL-57 And all this great thing that He knowed would come to pass, after He--He had spoke it, He could take a rest. Everything under control! His seed was His Word, and His Word is a seed. Jesus said it was. And everything would be all right, because He had said for it to bring forth of its kind, transforming only to its kind. See, His Word had to be of Its kind. If He said a \"palm\" tree, He didn't mean a palm and oak mixed together. He meant a palm tree here, and an oak tree here, everything positionally in its place. [Genesis 1:11-12] Oh, if we could only learn that, that what part of the Word we are, we must take our place, no matter what it is.\n\nL-58 I think of a little sister here in the wheel chair, sometime, how many faithful prayers has been made over it. Then we don't understand, so we just commit it to God. And with... She is a flower here among you, with her pleasantness and everything. See, that we can get up and go around, how she would long to do that, but yet she is pleasant just the way she sits. I always get inspired to watch the little lady, see, because she... We all believe in healing. We've seen God do miracles far beyond that, see. And she knows that, too, see, but she's willing to take her place.\n\nL-59 See, whatever it is, that's what we want. And I believe it was David, said, \"I would rather be a doormat at the house of the Lord, than to dwell in tents with the wicked.\" You see, no matter what it is, \"take my place.\" [Psalms 84:10]\n\nL-60 Sometimes you have to separate from everything that's dear on earth, to you, to take your position that God has called you to. I'm sure you can read between the lines, what I'm saying. See? Sometimes the very dearest person on earth, you have to shake hands with them; just take your position in Christ, to where God has called you. See? But what is God doing? Transforming you from what you was. Maybe a daughter or a son, or whatever it is, from a lovely family sometimes, He places you somewhere else. Because, it's His way of doing it, see, by the renewing of your mind, to obey the Word of God, regardless of what the price is. See? These things don't come... It didn't call...\n\nL-61 Our redemption wasn't a cheap thing, it was the Son of God had to die for us. See? It isn't... Things of value come of great price. To bring this Message, it wasn't easy. See? No, it isn't. I had to forsake everything that was dear to me, even my own people, everybody. But you see the value of it is, you see, is to do the will of God. And to do that, which knowing that 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min there is something in me, when they used to say... Well, they was going to put me away; thought I lost my mind. \"Baptizing in the Name of Jesus Christ, contrary to the church. And all these things!\" They said, \"He is crazy.\" But, you see, no matter what they said, there is something has to be done. And God just takes a person, sticks him in His hand, and say, \"Do this,\" and you do it. [Acts 22:3]\n\nL-62 What a price it might have been to Saint Paul; taught under Gamaliel, the greatest teacher of the day. And they come down... And the very thing that he considered heresy, the things that he thought that was the worse things that could have happened to the church, he comes right around and becomes a partaker of It. A strange thing! \"And how God works in wonderous ways, in strange, odd ways, His wonders to perform.\"\n\nL-63 When God had spoke it, He knowed His Word was a seed; and it could, it would bring forth of its kind. Now, it was commanded to bring forth only of its kind, and it will always do that if man don't tamper with it. And so would God's Church and everything else, bring forth of the kind like it was at the first, if theologians didn't tamper with that Word, trying to put It somewhere else, or something else. God has spoke It. And no matter how much they can, they try to contaminate It and tamper It, and so forth, It's going to bring forth of Its kind. There is just nothing to stop It.\n\nL-64 I hope I don't sound like I'm yelling at you all. [Brother Branham adjusts a microphone--Ed.] Is that too loud? [Congregation says, \"No.\"]\n\nL-65 And, see, now we find everything in order. God spoke it, and He said, \"Let there be, let there be. And let there be an Eden. Let there be beautiful flowers. Let there be My son, in My Own image, stand over there in the garden of Eden, and let his bride stand by his side.\" Oh, how beautiful, what that was. And the Father, He was a Father, you see, so there come His Own children coming forth. And He made a paradise for them. God loves to do things for His children.\n\nL-66 Don't you remember how, you mothers, and how no matter how; if you had to allowance the table, if Junior needed a good pair of shoes that he liked, you--you'd do it, see. Whatever it was, to do something for your children! Dad, how you'd work a little harder, to get something for the children. See?\n\nL-67 Well, that just shows that we are way down here, a parent. He is the extreme Parent, see, and how much more! No wonder the apostle said, \"Eye has not seen, or ear has not heard, neither has it entered the heart of man, what God has for them, in store, that love Him.\" We just can't conceive in our mind, we, our mind isn't eligible of thinking the right--right direction what God has for store, in us that love Him. See, we, I can imagine what it will be, I can think what it will be, but I--I... my mind is not--not--not capable of thinking how great it is. It's beyond that. Could you imagine what Heaven will be when we'll all be there, and young, and no sin? And no... Oh, what a beautiful place! But, see, it's beyond that. See, we, it can't even enter the heart of man, what God has for them, in store. He spoke it, and it's going to be so. [I Corinthians 2:9]\n\nL-68 Now after all this beautiful layout that He had there, of His... I don't mean to say it in that word, layout, but kind of like the... Don't the mother, before the coming child, don't they call that layette? They get the... all the little booties and everything ready, you know, just for the arriving of this little portion of love that God is sending, getting that. That's what God did for Adam and Eve. He created this garden of Eden. He had spoke it. It was in His mind. And when He says it, then it has to happen.\n\nL-69 Bear that on mind now. What He says, it must happen! See, He can't... Nothing can--can hinder it, nothing can keep it from happening. There is nothing can keep it from happening. God said so, that settles it! God said it, it's going to happen.\n\nL-70 Now He had all this in mind, and He said, \"Let there be.\" Now, that's Genesis 1, see, \"Let there be this. Let there be that. Let there be.\" He was sowing seed. \"Let it be here. Let it be here. Let it be here.\" And He knew it was going to be that way, because it cannot change.\n\nL-71 Now that gives us faith, then. And what He said Here, it's going to be. So let's let that Seed fall into our hearts, that we might be the bedding grounds of That, see, into our hearts. And let us act out this place that He has placed us in, in the last days. See, \"Let the Seed fall in our hearts, Lord. Let Thy Word fall in my heart.\" Let there not be any unbelief! 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min [Matthew 13:23]\n\nL-72 Like Abraham, when he was an old man, looked like impossible. \"How they going to do that? How is he going to be this way?\" He never considered that. He just received the Word of God, and went on believing it, and God brought it to pass. Now, God had said all these things, so he knew it would be. And it did, He brought forth of its kind.\n\nL-73 Now that He had transformed then, all the seed into the living creature and creation that it was supposed to be, it came up just as He said it would. He said, \"Let it be.\" Maybe hundreds and hundreds of years passed, but here we find it a beautiful Eden, and the big birds a-flying. Them birds didn't have to die. And the wolf and the lamb were feeding together, and the lion, the leopard and ox. And there was no killing, no death, no sorrow. And there was Adam and Eve, walking in the garden of Eden. Every seed bringing forth, it never could do nothing else. It never could do nothing else, because God said, \"Let it be that way.\" It had to be that way.\n\nL-74 Oh, how I would like to stop here just a minute, to say, see, there is where we are facing, yet, the completion of that Word.\n\nL-75 Now God said, \"Let there be.\" And here it come up, first, perfectly, just exactly. Now, this tree can only bring forth that tree. This tree can only bring forth this tree. And Adam, a son of God, can only bring forth a son of God. See, you get what I mean? It's every thing after its kind, and so God could say, \"Well, I'll just rest now.\"\n\nL-76 And did you notice, it was very few words that God ever spoke, actually, from that time on? He committed it, after the fall, to His prophets, and they bring forth the Word now, you see. God rested, He didn't have no more to do. They just go to His headquarters and knock on the door, say, \"Father, what is it?\" And He sends the Word down by them. See, He has a system, and the way of doing those things.\n\nL-77 \"Let it be just...\" And that's the way it was, everything, of its seed bringing forth of its kind. Now when everything looked so pretty, and everything coming to pass just to what God had said, now here comes that slimy, dirty deceiver.\n\nL-78 Now that's what I'm trying to warn you all here about. When you see God's Seed begin to take hold, to grow, watch out for that fellow coming in just as slick as he can be, quote Scripture just to who wouldn't have it, see. Watch him, 'cause he is a deceiver.\n\nL-79 I'm going to call it, instead of a--a conformer, being conformed, he is a deformer, deforming the things that's been conformed. He is a deformer, and, he, a deformer, or a perverter, or a corrupter of the original Seed and the original program.\n\nL-80 Now you see here, like in your group here this morning, you got a program, you got a vision. Now watch for that corrupter, oh, he'll be sly and slick as he can be, you see. But keep your vision, boy. See, keep holding to that.\n\nL-81 Now also we find out that, when he come in, he deformed that seed. And he corrupted that seed by getting into the bedding grounds, which was Eve, and corrupting that seed, with a corruptible seed, before it could get there, to corrupt that beautiful garden of Eden.\n\nL-82 Where--where, Heaven, the only thing that that is, is just the restoration. Where we are now, we are on our road back to that original beginning of the creation of God, back to the garden of Eden again; husband and wife, without--without any--any sin or anything, to live Eternally. But the--the tran-... the...\n\nL-83 Now, now He wants us to transform our minds, by the renewing; or transformed, be transformed by the renewing of our--our minds.\n\nL-84 Now Satan comes in and puts in a deforming to the Word, making It say something that It isn't. Now that's what he did in the beginning. And now notice, this is going to sound awful strange this morning, to--to people, if I don't wait and base too much thought here before I get to my regular thought that I wanted to--to get to you. Is this, that, the deformer came in; and as God had took six thousand years with the original Word, to bring forth every word of its kind, and everything that He made would be God's Own Word bringing forth of its kind, now the deformer has took six thousand years, and to deform that Word of God. And what has he done? He has brought hisself to a new type of Eden, Satan's Eden. That's where we're living today. 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min\n\nL-85 How did he do that? How could it happen? Now the striking part is how he did it. And that's where we have to, what I'm here for, to lay this down before you, so that you can study of it now, and with the brothers here, and so forth, in the weeks to come, that you can see how Satan did this. And watch how cunning he is, and how sly he is.\n\nL-86 Now, he deformed these seeds. Now, he could not destroy them, he just deformed them. Now we realize that sin is righteousness perverted. It's just a--a lie is a truth misrepresented. See, anything. An adultery is the right act, that God ordained, just took in the wrong way. See, anything. And death is a perversion of life. Death just takes, see, deforms life.\n\nL-87 Now he had six thousand years to do it with his poison spray. And how did he do it? Now this is the striking part. And listen close now. He did it by civilization. Now that sounds strange, but that's what. I'm going to make a statement here that will keep you guessing, maybe, for a few minutes; I hope not. But did you realize this? Now I'm not trying to support ignorance. But did you know that civilization, science, education, and the things that we cherish so great today, is the very instrument of Satan, even civilization? Civilization never come by God. Civilization come by Satan. Now I'll prove that to you by the Word, just in a few minutes.\n\nL-88 Civilization is not of God. For, let me show you; in this civilization, the more civilized we get as we work through science, we are always killing ourselves. See? And this civilization has built up to its pinnacle now, and we got death in this civilization. We got sin in this civilization. We got sickness in this civilization. That can't be of God.\n\nL-89 So, God, in the Mil-... His great, Own great Kingdom that is to come, we will have a civilization, but it'll not be anything like this. It won't be by science. It'll be a faith civilization, by the Word. See?\n\nL-90 This scientific civilization we have, is exactly Satan's trap, and that's what he has killed the people with. That's what he is killing us, every day, with. That's how, as we eat, each day; instead of living, we die. They have so perverted everything, to even take just so much of this and mix it with this, and hybrid this and that, that, till it's dying. It's a dying race. And no matter what you try to do, you die.\n\nL-91 You seen that picture last night, of those Africans. You know why... They never had penicillin. Them people live longer than we do. They don't even know they... Germs don't bother them. See, why, a germ would throw up his hand and surrender at them. See? Because he, see, he don't, he... They don't. Why? They haven't all been... See, we'll take, science to figure out, like a penicillin or something they'll place in us, to--to take this disease out, and it tears down something else, and makes a bedding ground for something else. See? Now, he don't do that. See?\n\nL-92 Now any, many of you people come from farms. Anyone knows that a good healthy plant never needs to be sprayed. It's--it's got a repellent on it itself, of life, and a germ won't even get on it, on a real--on a real healthy plant. It's this hotbed plant, it's this hybrid plant you have to baby!\n\nL-93 For instance, some of you fellows here are Westerners here. Look back in the time of the old longhorned cow. Today you say you got a better beef with your--with your Hereford. Have you? You haven't. That old longhorn cow, not taking up for the old girl, but she could, she would winter out here like a deer. Oh, she was skinny and everything, but she was twice...\n\nL-94 This Hereford, you pull hay under him, when you take his picture, up to his tummy, nearly, to show his beef to the hock. And what is it? You turn him lose out there, he would die. He couldn't winter it if he had to. You have to feed him, and everything else, to take care of him, baby him around. He's a hybrid. See? But a real, genuine old longhorn, just turn him loose.\n\nL-95 That's the way today with our Christians. We got so many we have to softsoap, to beg them, put them, make them a deacon in the church, pat him on the shoulder, and make him some great position in the church. Or, if you don't, why, he, he won't--he won't come in, if you don't let this one do this, and this one do that. It's babying.\n\nL-96 Could you imagine genuine Christians being that? They were rugged. They were burly. Could you imagine Saint Paul being that type of a Christian, could you imagine Saint Peter, \"Being now--now, if you don't make me general overseer, well, I don't know, I might go join So-and-so\"? They were rugged man. They were men of faith. They lived 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min with God. They walked with God. They were men of few words. They served God, day and night, constantly. You didn't have to spray them and baby them, and offer them this, that, or the other. They were man, rugged! They were genuine seeds, not hybrid in denominations.\n\nL-97 \"If you, the Methodists don't treat me right, I'll go to the Baptists. The Baptists don't treat me right, I'll go to the Pentecostals. If they don't treat me right, I'll go back to the Catholics, or whatever more.\" See, they, it's a hybrid, have to keep them sprayed, \"Yes, Doctor Reverend Brother So-and-so.\" That ain't Christianity.\n\nL-98 Christianity asks--asks no titles, it asks no favors. It only knows God. It's original seed. It loves God, and loves one another. There is no spraying on them, and babying them, and patting them around, and saying, \"Yes, well, this sister, well, I think it's all right for her to have short hair, and this one not.\" And--and. there is no such stuff as that, and let them get by with this. It's--it's rugged, it's the Gospel! Lay it out there, let it fall where it will. Christians love it. Must I be carried Home, to Heaven, On a flowery bed of ease, While others fought to win the prize And sailed through bloody seas?\n\nL-99 Must I be patted on the back, and this, that, and the other, and babied? I expect my place out yonder with the rugged. I expect not to come up there with no trophy scars at all. If I must fight, if I must reign, increase my courage, Lord!\n\nL-100 See, let me stand like a Christian. Not to be a--a hybrid plant. Have to be babied and petted, and brought into something. You're not brought in anyhow, Christianity, you're borned in it. You become a new creature, you're a seed of God, that comes into the earth.\n\nL-101 Now, now we find out that he sprayed this poison spray, and that spray was the spray of modern understanding, education, science, and civilization, the very things that we cherish so much. Did you ever stop to think that our great enemy, in the natural life today among the nations, is communism? What is the god of communism? Civilization, and education, science. That's right, isn't it? That's what they live on and thrive on, is science, scientific, sciences, a god of science. Now if you would just... and with the poison spray of this modern civilization, science and education.\n\nL-102 Now let me prove to you that education and civilization come from the Devil. Now let us turn back here and see, if you want to, in Genesis, the 4th chapter. All right, now let's begin with the 16th verse of Genesis 4. Fourteen here or... Genesis 4, pardon me. Now notice Satan.\n\nL-103 You people that follow these tapes, with our--our brother here, now you've heard me preach on the Serpent's Seed. And that cannot be denied. That was opened up in one of those Seven Seals. It was hid.\n\nL-104 Now if children has come up under that kind, see, under that kind of teaching, that's what their parents was, they have the nature of their parents, their denominations, and so forth, they have to believe that. See, they believe that because they're borned under that parent. But today we're not borned under that parent; our Parent is the Word. And the Word... \"Well,\" say, \"I was borned under God, too.\" For that age. But this is the climax age, this is the age beyond those denominations.\n\nL-105 There had to come forth, must come forth; God ordained it so, that there must come forth, them Seven Seals must be opened. It was supposed to be done in this Laodicean age. And I think, beyond any shadow of doubt... Not as we brag; we have no brag, only on Jesus Christ; none of us. We only brag on Jesus Christ. But we are thankful with the... for the privilege of knowing by any... beyond any shadow of doubt, God has chose us in this last days, and has proven it by the signs in the Heavens and in the earth; and every one of them coming right straight back to the Word, to prove that it's so, this age that we live in, the Message and how It is. We're not a cult. We're not a bunch of fanatics. We are servants of God, that's been called by the Holy Ghost. You'll have all kinds of names tacked to you, but that don't mean it's so. [Joel 2:30], [Acts 2:19]\n\nL-106 Now remember, Satan's son was Cain. Now I think you all been through all the tapes, which, I see your libraries out here, of them. Now remember that Eve become pregnant by Satan, and in the same day... We got a case of it in 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min Tucson now, that a woman, if she becomes... she lives with two man, she can have two different type of children. We know that. I knowed it in breeding dogs and things, and so forth, if it's right away.\n\nL-107 So Satan, that morning perhaps, met this evil one, which was the serpent; not a reptile, but a beast; most subtle, cunning, smart, of all of the beasts, just under man. And man is beast, himself, and we are--we are mammal, warmblooded animal. [Genesis 3:1], [II Corinthians 11:3]\n\nL-108 And--and Satan was the next link here, this serpent, was the next thing to a man, from a chimpanzee, stand between man and--and the chimpanzee. Now science is looking for that missing link. And it's so hid by taking him down, and even not a bone in him looks like a man, see, making him a reptile.\n\nL-109 Now we find now, that, this fellow found Eve in the garden of Eden, this young woman that knowed no sin, knowed not what her nakedness was. And he knew. He was smart, subtile, wise. And he told her, \"The seed, the--the fruit was pleasant and it was desirable,\" and when he lived with her that morning. And then, see, then, the afternoon, she persuaded Adam to do the same thing, telling him what it was.\n\nL-110 And then Adam deliberately, knowing he ought not to a-done it, walked out with his wife and did this act. Which, finally he would have come to it anyhow. But, see, it had to be that way, the wisdom of God, 'cause this then, that, displays His attribute to be a Saviour, Father, Healer. You've heard me preach on that, see. Now if that hadn't have been done...\n\nL-111 He just let them out there on free moral agency, to let them act. He couldn't make them do it, and then still be just. But He could put them equal with Him, and free moral agency, and then let them do it themselves. And He knew they would do it.\n\nL-112 And so then, you see, then when Adam lived with, she brought forth twins. And one of them was of Satan; and one of them was of Adam, which was of God. Cain and Abel.\n\nL-113 And that happens. We got a case there in Tucson now. The--the white woman lived with her husband one morning, and that afternoon she lived with a Negro. And one of the little boys... There was two little boys was born. One of them was a little kinky-headed Negro, and the other one is a--a blond-headed kid, real pretty. And--and, think now, she is trying to make the white father take care of both children. And he said, \"I'll take care of my own, but not his. Let the Negro man take care of his own child.\" So, you see, it's true.\n\nL-114 There is always twins. And that's the reason... Don't forget this, little flock. The church in the last days is going to be twins, \"so close that it'll deceive the Elected...\" Matthew 24: 24, see. The church is going to... It's a Pentecostal move. It's so much like the real thing, till it would deceive the very Elected if it was possible. And a little later on, if I get the chance, I want to explain what, how that election comes. See, it's going to deceive them because it's almost like the same thing. See, just two fathers, that's all; same mother, same church, same movement, same thing. The bedding ground is the same, where the Word falls; but one of them, like here, is perverted. You understand? Say \"amen\" if you did see. [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] See, one of them is a perversion, because it's the wrong father. Which, I will prove someday, if God will let me, that denomination is the mark of the beast. See, it's the wrong father, he is stirring people to an organization instead of to the Word. See, it's the wrong father. It's a Cain move. [Matthew 24:24], [Jude 1:11]\n\nL-115 When I go home this time, I'm preaching on the subject, The Trail Of The Serpent; the beast at the beginning, and the beast at the end; and trail him right through the Bible, and show how he heads up. See? And you all get that on the telephone, you see, if the Lord permits us to do it. And now just watch how cunning that fellow is, how he's just exactly just... Well, they're just like Judas and Jesus there, both brothers in their tribe, just like Esau and Jacob. And--and like the--the crow and the dove, sitting on the same roost. And everything is a twin, in--in this great warfare that we're in.\n\nL-116 The enemy uses deception, like he did to Eve, \"Oh, God has said? Surely, but--but surely...\" See? See, trying to reason it beyond what God said originally, \"Thou shalt die!\" He said, \"Yes, God said That, but surely...\" See that spray over it? See? But what God says, God keeps, He don't need 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min any help from Satan. He keeps It. So, don't never be deceived by that. Now we notice, then, that it brought forth of its kind. Now in Genesis here, we find out, after the spraying of this poison of knowledge.\n\nL-117 Now, science is knowledge. And all we hear is science, science, science, science, the great subject in school, science! Today, a better automobile, a better this, a better home, a better house, a better this\" a better that. What are we doing? Dying, all the time. Created an automobile, we quit walking; quit walking, we would turn to blubber. Well, we don't have man anymore; we have jellyfish. That's right.\n\nL-118 And the woman, all she does, throw the clothes, and then [Brother Branham taps something--Ed.] press a button, there it is. When, your mammy used to walk to the spring, and pack water, and chop wood, and boil over a kettle somewhere, and--and fix her clothes like that. And we're so soft, if they'd do it, it would kill us. But, we can't help it, this is the age we're living in.\n\nL-119 Even science says now, that, \"Little girls are coming into menopause, young women between twenty and twenty-five years old.\" I met them right in the line. \"And young men go through their middle age, between twenty and twenty-five years old.\" My mother... My wife went through, about thirty-five to forty. My mother went through, from forty-five to fifty. See how they're degenerating in this last days. Because why? We're working more on science.\n\nL-120 Hundred and fifty years ago, the only travel a man had was by horse or by foot. And now he goes by jet, almost by a thought. See, science has done it, and that's of the Devil. Now you say, \"That right, Brother Branham?\" Yes, sir.\n\nL-121 Let's take Genesis now, 4. And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD,...\n\nL-122 Now watch the first thing he done. (You tell me when you think we got enough here, 'cause I'll just stop on this anywhere.) See, \"Cain went out from the Presence of the Lord.\" There he made his mistake. And there is where you will make a mistake, and there is where I'll make the mistake, the very minute we walk out of the Presence of God. ... Cain went... from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.\n\nL-123 See how religious it was, went around to the \"East\" side, East side. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and Enoch builded a city, (see, civilization), he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. And... Enoch was born Irad: and Irad be-... and Irad be-... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] ... took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other was Zillah. And Adah bare Jabal: and... the father of such dwelt in tents, and of such that has cattle. And his brother's name was Jubal: (I guess, J-u-b-al) he was the father... as such as handle the harps and organs. (See, music; science, see, coming in.) And Zillah,... also bare Tubul-cain, an instructer of every a-r-t-i-f-i-c-e-r of brass and iron: (in other words, kind of molding, putting it together), and the sister of Tubal-... Tubal-cain was Naamah. And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. If Cain shall be avenged seven times, truly Lamech seventy... seven folds, or sevenfold. [Genesis 4:17-24]\n\nL-124 Now notice, as soon as they went out from the Presence of the Lord, they started building cities, they started making instruments; they started in science, to making brass and iron, and--and playing music, and so forth. See? See? Now where did it come from? Who went out? Cain, the serpent's seed. You understand it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"-Ed.] Cain went out. And, notice, he went out from the Presence of the Lord, and started working in science.\n\nL-125 Now look where he is still working, see: science, education, cities, culture. It's of the Devil. Who started it? The Devil. Who is it of today? The Devil. Atomic bombs and things, to destroy us with. We live in it. We have to live here. We are a being, we have to stay here. But God's great civilization won't have any of that in it. See? And science is taking--is taking the natural things and perverting it to do things that it wasn't intended to do.\n\nL-126 And so is scientific religion! It takes the Word of God and makes a church organization out of it, instead of doing the things that it's supposed to do. 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min They say, \"The days of miracles is passed.\" The Bible said, \"He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" \"There is no such a thing as Divine healing.\"\n\nL-127 \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. These signs shall follow them that believe: In My Name they shall cast out devils; they'll speak with new tongues; if they take up serpents, or drink deadly things, it won't harm them; if they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" What? Then, all nations, everybody, every creature! \"Lo, I am with you, even to the end of the earth, end of the--of the world cosmos, the whole thing, end of the consummation.\" He is absolutely there! [Mark 16:17-18]\n\nL-128 And now, see, they take science, and say, \"Oh, well, as long as we gather together and join church, and we become this, or a good straight member. We pay our...\"\n\nL-129 See, it's--it's not saying, \"Oh, there is no such a thing as God.\" You heard my tape on the false christs in the last days. See, not the false Jesus (Satan knowed better than that, see), but it's false christs. Christ means the \"anointed one.\" And they are actually anointed, anointed with (what?) the Holy Spirit, to do signs and wonders. And they do it.\n\nL-130 But, see, when it comes down now, we're in the last age, not back in the Pentecostal age there. We are over here in the last age. And the first age begin with the Word, which was Christ. And the last age has to end with the Word, which is Christ. And these other things, these shucks and so forth, as I have explained, is just carriers of the Word, to serve its purpose until It comes into the full stature, see, of what the original grain was.\n\nL-131 Now the 25th verse. And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. And to Seth... And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: and then men begin to call on the name of the LORD. [Genesis 4:25-26] See how that serpent's seed went off into science, education, cities, and music, and great things, and education, and science, and so forth.\n\nL-132 But the seed of the righteous one, who it was... See, Eve didn't have a seed. You know that. The woman doesn't have a seed, the female. She has an egg, but not a seed. But she... appointed him, a seed, see, appointed by God's appointment, she took the seed. And the great Seed, course, from the woman, was that God gave. See, God appointed her a seed instead of the one that Cain slew; that, the enemy, death, serpent's seed slew God's seed, in perversion there, you see. God appointed, through the woman, a Seed, which is Christ, see, to bring back the original seed again. You see it? And so you see the perversion brought death through education and intelligence, and what we call today, science and religion, and so forth, it brought death. But she... appointed him, a seed, and then man began to call upon the Name of the Lord, and begin to come back to the Word again. See?\n\nL-133 And remember, follow that seed, as we will track it in a few weeks, on this serpent. You follow that, it switches right through the Scripture. Watch it. Them two vines grow right together, as you heard my Message on \"the vine.\" They come right up together, and so close together that it would almost deceive the very elected, if possible, in the last days when it come to the head. It puts forth a grain just like a wheat, but it isn't a wheat, see, it isn't. It's a shuck, yet.\n\nL-134 Now, see their civilization, education. I think I've got about ten more Scriptures, you see, wrote down there, but I think not to go through that. But we understand by this, that education, science and civilization, is of the Devil. That's right. It isn't of God. It is of the Devil. Now, I don't say you shouldn't have it. No, certainly not. A little later on, I can, we'll prove that; that God...\n\nL-135 Just like you wearing clothes, you women, us man. We wasn't supposed to wear clothes, in the beginning. But, see, being that we live in this age we do, we must wear clothes, see. It's appointed to us to do that. We must wear them. But in the beginning, we didn't have to, see, because we knew no sin. But now we have to.\n\nL-136 Now we have to have automobiles. Now we must go to places and visit, and so forth, in automobiles and science, 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min and so forth, but it isn't of God. It is not of God. Educations, but they're...\n\nL-137 God's form of education, civilization, science, is in its original condition, see, it goes beyond this what we're doing. Now look, they take certain things and put certain things together, and it makes a chemical that will destroy. Now leave them in their right position, they're all right; put them together, they're all wrong. See? See, it brings death.\n\nL-138 And when you try to take the Word of God and put It in religion of this world, you bring death to yourself. It kills the subject. See what I mean? It kills the person. You say, \"Well, now look, you believe in God. Oh, now, you don't have to believe that. If you--you--you... our church.\" Right then, that's the boom that kills the--that kills the subject.\n\nL-139 You've got to let everything fall aside, and take the Word only. Stay right with that Word. Don't leave. When God said so, that's just what it is. I don't care what education can prove.\n\nL-140 In the days of Noah, they could prove there was no water up there in the skies. But God said there was coming some down, and it come. That's right.\n\nL-141 They say today, \"There is no fire up there, to fall.\" But watch it fall, one day. Uh-huh. \"How we going to do this and do that?\" Watch God do it. He will. He said it would do it.\n\nL-142 And that Seed will take a hold somewhere. Glory to God! The only thing He's looking for, today, is a bedding ground, somewhere that It can bed.\n\nL-143 It'll start in somebody, and they'll pervert It, and spray It like he did Eve. It started in Eve, for her to bed forth and bring forth sons of God, not sons of Satan. But she was a bedding ground, and it fell in the wrong place. So will the Word fall in an unbeliever, or a doubter, or a skeptic. It'll make a church member out of them, but never a son or daughter of God. You tell them to let their hair grow; they'll laugh in your face. You tell them to do this or that, or the man to do it, they'll laugh in your face. It's not sons of God. It's the wrong bedding ground, yet they're holding the Seed. See the false anointed ones? They're anointed, yes, with the Holy Spirit, speak in tongues, and do signs and wonders; but it's of Satan.\n\nL-144 Jesus said, \"Many will come to Me in that day, and say, 'Lord, Lord, have not I cast out devils, and--and worked great and mighty works and wonders in Your Name?'\" He said, \"Depart from Me, you workers of iniquity.\" [Matthew 7:22-23], [Psalms 66:18]\n\nL-145 What is iniquity? David said, \"If I conceive iniquity in my heart, God will not hear me.\" See? Iniquity is something that you know that you ought to do and you won't do it. You know better, but won't do it. It's iniquity, see. You know they should stay with the Word of God, but for the church's sake, or somebody else's sake, or something else, you'll stray from the Word of God and do what the organization says. \"Well, I don't know. My church says we should do it this a-way, and I believe it this a-way.\"\n\nL-146 See, and it's right before you that you shouldn't do it. That's iniquity. \"Depart from Me, you that work iniquity.\"\n\nL-147 Look at the great Saint Paul, in I Corinthians 13, he said, \"Though I speak with tongue of men and Angels...\" Now you that want, or somebody want, to lay onto that that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost? Paul said, \"Though I speak with tongues like men and Angels, and have not charity\" like you all have here among you, \"I am nothing.\" See? [I Corinthians 13:1-2]\n\nL-148 You can speak with tongues, yes, because It's the Word. A preacher can take this Word, and go forth and preach It, and say that Word, and that Word will grow. But the preacher could be a hypocrite, himself. It's the Word. See? But the true living creature of God takes all of the purpose, the Word. \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out.\" And you add something else with That, you got a perverted plant. [Matthew 4:4]\n\nL-149 If I start out here with a wheat, and put a--a cocklebur with it, and would interbreed them together, if it could be done so by the pollen, and put in there, I got a wheat cocklebur. See? It looks like a wheat, and yet it's a cocklebur. It ain't genuine life, it can't reproduce itself again. See? It'll come forth, but it can't reproduce itself. A--a--a donkey can breed to a mare horse, and she'll bring forth a mule, but that mule can't breed back to a mule. It's a 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min hybrid.\n\nL-150 \"Let every word bring forth of its kind.\" See, it can breed once. And the church can come as an organization, once, but it can't rebreed itself; it brings out another organization. Lutheran can't breed to the Lutheran; it brought out a Methodist. And a Methodist brought out a Pentecostal. See, it can't rebreed back, because it's dead. It can't start a revival. Where did God ever start a revival in an organization? Look over your history. He never did. It's the organization that forms behind the revival.\n\nL-151 When Luther, the man of God, came forth with the message of justification, behind him come the Lutheran church. They could never could build up.\n\nL-152 Then God sent a man by the name of John Wesley, there come a revival behind that. What'd they do? Organize it, never could rebreed itself again. See, it's sterile.\n\nL-153 Hallelujah! But the Word of God shall ever endure! That's right. It'll bring forth Its kind.\n\nL-154 Here come a Pentecostal along, he can't; look what it done, organized. It can't rebreed itself. They can have Oral Robertses and everything else, all over the country, it cannot do it. It'll hang right back to that old natural breed of the mule. It cannot! No matter how many injections it has, it's still; how many of the spiritual affairs it has, and whatever it has. And you, you're adults, you know what I'm talking about. No matter how many husband and wives it has, and whatever more, and how many little sisters it builds up out here, and little churches and organizations, it cannot breed a revival. It's finished. It crossed up to the world, from the Word of God, and it cannot reproduce itself again. God will raise up some other something and start His Word moving on; and if it organizes, it'll die too! That's right. It cannot reproduce itself, because it's a hybrid. That's correctly.\n\nL-155 Look at your hybrid corn today, they say, \"That's the best corn.\" It's--it's a killer. It's what's killing you. Your lives wasn't made for... Your bodies wasn't made for that. Your bodies was made for the original grain. That's the reason your fathers and mothers, and so forth, lived longer. That's the reason they were tough. Man, seventy and eighty years old, was rough and tough. See, they lived on the natural things. Watch these old mountain men out here, live on deer and--and the original grains. Put a man in here, in the city; here he comes along, a big slop, at about thirty-five, forty years old. Soft? Certainly! Well, I get off the subject, don't I?\n\nL-156 Notice, but I'm trying to get it over to you, that's civilization, what we call culture. Culture, you hear so much about that. Now, did you ever hear what my estimation of culture was? It's a man that ain't got nerve enough to kill a rabbit, but can eat a bellyful of it after somebody else kills it. So, I, that's what I--I--I--I think of culture, you see. That's, that's right, see. We don't...\n\nL-157 God don't come by... It isn't culture a man into God. You don't civilize him into God. He is born, a seed of God, from God, always was God, and can never be nothing else but God. You're not cultured into It.\n\nL-158 Now, how he has his kind of Eden, and by a deformed seed! Satan has made his great even, his great Eden now. What is it? Culture, science, beautiful churches, high steeples, fine polished preachers, education: \"DA., D., Ph.D., LL.D., Doctor of Literature, Doctor of Divinity, Doctors!\" Every time you pronounce that, it just takes him that much farther from God, just throws him plumb away. And the congregations don't want somebody stand up there and use the words of \"hit, hain't, and tote, and carry, and fetch.\" They don't want that. They want some beautiful something. [Hebrews 9:22]\n\nL-159 That's the same thing Cain had on his mind, their daddy, at the beginning, offered flowers and fruits of the land. When, God wanted sacrifice, the man with the revelation of God! It was blood; not a pear, or a peach, or a plum, or whatever it was, or an apricot, as they say now. It was the blood that brought us out of the garden of Eden, a--a degraded blood, a woman that let the seed of the wrong person be planted into the womb and start it.\n\nL-160 Now we find, to prove the Message is just timely, what I'm speaking to you about, to prove it, look about days of hybreeding today, trying to make a prettier specie. Look at hybreeding. Look in the plant life. Here last summer...\n\nL-161 It was this summer, it was, I had a little old wild flower; he was showing me out there a few minutes ago, it come 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min on my mind. A little wild flower I had in the bed here, I had to water that thing twice a day, to keep it alive. It was a hybrid. But it originated from another little yellow flower, which was put together with something else, to make this flower.\n\nL-162 And that little guy stood out there, when, you could dig ten feet in the ground and couldn't find even enough moisture to spit. See, it was--it was--it was just living in the dust, and it was just as pretty, and it didn't have to be watered. It was the original. It wasn't hybrid. There was nothing mixed to it, it was genuine flower.\n\nL-163 And this was something mixed with it, have to water it and pet it, and baby it. See? This you didn't; no bugs got on it. We have to spray it, and everything else, to keep them; and the flies and gnats and things, them off like that. If you don't, it'd kill them. You don't have, a gnat wouldn't come near him!\n\nL-164 Oh, that's a real, genuine, born-again Christian. You could tempt him with anything you want to. He is still a Christian. Tempt her wherever you want to be, she is still a Christian.\n\nL-165 A little lady from one of the brothers here, some of your people, their church wrote me a letter the other day. Said, \"Daddy don't want me to go to a baseball... or a basketball game, Brother Branham. We believe...\" She said, was twelve years old, said, \"Brother Branham, we believe you have the Word of the Lord, in what you tell us now.\" Said, \"I kind of think daddy is wrong. But,\" said, \"what you say, I'm going to believe.\" Now, that sweet little girl, see.\n\nL-166 So I thought. \"Well,\" I said, \"honey, look if you are a Christian, you're a Christian anywhere. No matter where you're at, you're still a Christian. But,\" I said, \"you see, on the basketball floor, what daddy is thinking about, you hear them kids swearing and carrying on like that. I still believe you'd be a Christian. But, you see, daddy is more advanced in life than you are. See?\" Now, I said, \"Now you are twelve years old, and you said you had a little sister, four. Now she wants you to cut paper dolls. 'Oh, go on, I ain't got no time to cut paper dolls.' See, you are farther advanced than little sister.\"\n\nL-167 Now that's where the church ought to be today, further advanced in the Word of God. Not Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostals, Presbyterian; but advanced in the Word, to sons and daughters of God. Uh! All right. All right. The Message being timely, proved.\n\nL-168 By science, by his science and research, you see, they have tried to pervert everything, make a different seed, make a different something, make it prettier.\n\nL-169 Look at our sisters. I remarked a while ago, about how pretty they looked. Oh, you might stand them up out here in a world's contest with some of this Gloria Swanson's, or some of these stripteases and things over here in California, and they'd miss it a million miles. But their name ain't on that book of fame; it's on the Book of Life, see. Uh-huh. \"A meek and a humble spirit is a great treasure to God.\" And the Bible said for--for our women to \"adorn themselves with a meek and humble spirit, subject to your husbands, and sweetness.\" That's what's a great price in the sight of God. See? That's right. [I Peter 3:4]\n\nL-170 Not all this here, that's what they done; they, Max Factor, has beautified women, outwardly, which is of Satan. All that stuff is of the Devil. Did you know that? Certainly. It's all of the Devil.\n\nL-171 Now I remember my little wife when she was pretty and young, she didn't wear make-up. No. She come up, I baptized her in the Name of Jesus, when she was in little knee dresses like that, see. But now she is getting old, she said, \"I'm just getting so wrinkled.\"\n\nL-172 I said, \"You know, as you get older, my eyes get dimmer. I remember you the way you was, and I remember and know in my heart what you are going to be someday. See? See? See, with a quiet and sweet spirit that you have, God will get us together again over yonder. That's that, then we'll never be changed then.\" So why...\n\nL-173 But, you see, in the days of Noah, when the sons of God saw the daughters of man, were pretty, they taken unto them women, for wives. See, the sons of God saw the daughters of man, 'cause they were sexy and--and dressed like that. They, they lusted for the women, and they went for them, see. [Genesis 6:2] 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min\n\nL-174 I'm thankful that you sons of God see beyond that, see, how that women make themselves. See?\n\nL-175 But what is it? It's all pretty. It's a hybreeding. Take some of them, wash their face, they... you wouldn't know what you'd have. See? And that's right. Maybe enough temper to fight a buzz saw, and--and nasty, and--and ornery, and filthy, and run around with other man.\n\nL-176 I don't care what, my wife, I--I respect loyalty in any woman. When I was a little boy, I always said, \"If a negro woman wanted to be loyal, I would shed the last drop of my blood to keep her that way.\" See, I respect what's right, the right thing. I've tried to live by that, all my life. I was young then, now I'm old, I haven't changed my ideas a bit. See?\n\nL-177 Science, in the same pattern Eve did, he also has done to the church, pervert her over. He carried out his plans today, through his hybrid church, his modern Eden that we have today. We are living in a scientific Eden, Satan's Eden, a scientific Eden. [Isaiah 14:12-14]\n\nL-178 If you'd want to turn to it, in Isaiah 14:12. I'll quote it to you, if you want to, if you want, 12 and 14. ... Satan said in his ownself, I will exalt myself above the most High. He would have a kingdom, that it would be even the sons of God would worship him. [Isaiah 14:12-14] And that's just exactly what he's done. He's done it through church, religion, like he started in the beginning, religion. He's done it.\n\nL-179 Also as the prophet Paul seen, in II Thessalonians the 2nd chapter, that he--he heads up in E-... his, the great scientific Eden in this day, in scientific, in education and civilization. And has made, hisself, and will finally head up in the ecumenical council, where all churches will have to bow to him. And see what it is? It's that spirit of delusion working among the people; sons of God, which are made in the image of God; and daughters of man, which is made in the image of man; has taken them under falsehood, like he did Eve. And has formed, hisself, through his own gimmicks of science and education and culture, till he's got himself a modern, scientific, death Eden.\n\nL-180 Where, God, by His Word, spoke, and He had an Eden without death; no science, no education like we have today, or no civilization.\n\nL-181 You see it now, understand it? See, now he has got his Eden. Look, all the churches worship him. That's what, in Second Thessalonians here, He said. ... that man who calls himself God, sitting in the temple of God,... And all... upon the earth shall bow down and worship him, whose names are not written in the Lamb's book of life... before the foundation of the earth. [II Thessalonians 2:4]\n\nL-182 See, it's a modern Eden. Now what's he doing, himself? He is moving himself, Rome, his final great eating, Eden place.\n\nL-183 You see where that pope come over here the other day? Did you notice all them thirteen's that happened then? He spoke thirteen words, had thirteen taking communion, spoke in Yankee Stadium, which is thirteen. Everything was thirteen.\n\nL-184 And our nation's number is thirteen, appears in the 13th chapter of Revelation; thirteen stripes, thirteen stars, thirteen bars, thirteen numbers on the coins, thirteen stars on the coin, everything is thirteen, and a woman.\n\nL-185 Here comes the pope, the head, to the woman; the false antichrist to the false bride, of science. Which, our world, our American eastern world here, or Western World, has led the world, in science. Comes to her, in his scientific church, and now all Protestants is bowing to him, see, on thirteen. You see it? Everything is in a thirteen. Our whole nation, everything else, is thirteen, a woman's world. See, here we are, we got it. It turned into a woman's world in the garden of Eden, but it'll be God's world someday. Notice now. Now, also, these prophets and things has foretold it.\n\nL-186 And now all again has come like it was before God moved upon the earth, it's become a spiritual chaos. Certainly, it has.\n\nL-187 Here notice the second Eden typed closely to the first, to deceive, almost to take the Elected. Notice now, that. 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min I'm going to compare here, just a few minutes. Now I'm going to have to stop, 'cause it's eleven o'clock, and so listen. These two Edens, how this Eden has tried to type, just like Satan did at the beginning, to Eve in the real Eden, the first Eden. Just watch them, typed together now. See, we got it, now everybody understand clearly, a scientific Eden we're living in. See? Now, it wasn't God's Eden.\n\nL-188 God's Eden doesn't come by science, education, culture. It comes by the Word, see, calling all these things as though they were not. And notice, in the garden of Eden... Let's just compare them a little. Now notice.\n\nL-189 The man and his wife, hid in the garden of Eden, the pair was naked and didn't know it. Is that right? In God's Eden, the pair was naked and didn't know it.\n\nL-190 Now they are naked again and don't know it, Revelation 3, the Laodicean Church Age. Because thou... art naked, miserable, poor, wretched, blind, and don't know it. [Genesis 2:25], [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-191 Now, in God's Eden, they were naked and didn't know it. And now in Satan's Eden, be it by science and education, they are naked again and don't know it. What a perversion!\n\nL-192 Look at today. Look at man, trying to wear his wife's underneath clothes; and she is trying to wear his clothes. And he is trying to let his hair grow like hers; and she is cutting hers off like his. Oh, oh, oh, my! Man trying to be women, women trying to be man, a perversion! [Deuteronomy 22:5]\n\nL-193 That's the same thing the church is doing, same thing, the Laodicean Age. Notice.\n\nL-194 The reason that they didn't know they were naked, in the beginning, there was a Holy Spirit veil them from nakedness. They didn't know it. The Holy Spirit was over their eyes, they seen nothing but their brother and sister, see. The laws, they didn't know they were naked. Holy Spirit!\n\nL-195 Now the spirit of unholiness, uncleanliness and lust, has veiled them; education, science, \"Why, it's scientific. Wear shorts, it's cooler.\" The Indians teach you better than that. They wrap up in a blanket, to be air conditioned, see, and put on them. See, education has absolutely come back to a time, the very thing that they think has brought them to culture and civilization, has put them back in ignorance again, worse than they was in the first place.\n\nL-196 Schooling, education, look at schools! Look down there at university, other night, them boys! How many babies is born by them young ladies there, to them young ladies each year at the university! You think! You say, \"This is street trash.\" And them boys, them \"twenty-one jewels,\" they call them, with lipstick on, and--and hair banged, and rolled up on curlers and hanging down. They say that. And dirty-necked, filthy! You say, \"Well, that's just street trash.\" Is it? It's students of the university.\n\nL-197 They got on a big drunk, the other night. And they didn't know what to do, and so, to have kicks. And drinking and adultery, and everything like that, wasn't enough for them. They broke the bottles, and run up to women's door, and knock on the door; they come, punch them in the face. Cut one girl's eye completely out, and a lot of them disfigured for life. You think they'd let that out? No.\n\nL-198 Two of their boys riding up-and-down the street, and two young married women sitting on--on the steps, and they insulted the women. The cops picked them up and put them in jail. The dean come down there. And the whole thing is thriving on that university, that's the only works they got there. Said, \"Them is my kids. You turn them loose.\" They turned them loose.\n\nL-199 There you are; civilization, education, leads to death and chaos, and hell. Don't you listen to that stuff. Notice now.\n\nL-200 Eve just had to take a little peep, to see what the world looked like. You know, a lot of times, \"We have to just wear a little bit of this.\" Or, you know what I mean, just have to take a little bit of a peep, to see. Now in St. John or... [Romans 6:11], [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-201 First John 2:15, God said, \"If you love the world or even the love of the world, the love of God is not even in you.\" The things that's out there are dead. You are circumcised, cut off from it. You don't want the things of the world, you're dead to. They're dead. You don't want anything dead. It's rotten. It smells. How could a living something want 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min something that's filthy like that? See, you are alive in Christ. The Word makes you alive. [I John 2:15]\n\nL-202 My, when I think of it in this day that we're living, called education! You can't even get in the pulpit unless you got a Doctor's Degree, and so forth.\n\nL-203 It reminds me of a chaplain, one time, coming out of the army. He said--he said, \"Brother Branham, it was right after the First World War.\" Said, the chaplain said, \"Sergeant come by and said, 'Chaplain, you want to ride out to the battle front with me, out on the Argonne,'\" out there from La Salle, Lorraine, France, you know. And said, \"I went out towards the Argonne Forest.\" And said, \"He was taking number of so many tanks had been blowed up.\"\n\nL-204 And said, \"It was on an Easter morning.\" Said, \"I just got through... I walked through with a nurse, and she was giving those wounded boys, an American rose, you know, one an American used to. Them boys grabbed that rose, and just scream and cry, 'cause they knew it come from home.\" See, it was from home. And that's the way I think we do the Word, see, grab It, \"O God!\" It comes from Home, see.\n\nL-205 Said, \"I seen them, freak. Up in my heart...\" He said, \"I went out there and said... And the--the captain went on out to take a number of how many tanks had been destroyed, and things like that.\" Said, \"The Holy Spirit said, 'Go over to that little rock.'\" And he looked around. Said, \"They throwed that mustard and chlorine gas and,\" said, \"just burnt all the leaves off the trees. There wasn't a living thing left, and here it was Easter!\" He said, \"What an Easter! What an Easter, when not even grass on the ground, not nothing!\" And said Something attracted him to a rock. He pulled the rock over, said, \"There was a little Easter flower under it, had been kept under the rock, all through the poison gas.\" And said, \"I thought, 'O God, keep me under the Rock of Ages, till all of this poison is passed, and let me bloom in that Land yonder.'\"\n\nL-206 We could stop right here, if you wish to, 'cause I--I got so much here, I'd never get to it, anyhow, see, of things. So maybe I can come back again and get it to you.\n\nL-207 Oh, I just got through preaching the other day, \"A Thinking Man's Filter,\" you all have read That, see, \"produces a holy man's taste.\" Think, brethren. Whatever you do, think! Ephesians 5:26, in there said. [Ephesians 5:26]\n\nL-208 And we had talked, talked about the word of predestinated, you see, that stumbles so many of them. It's God's Word. He, He uses it, \"for we are predestinated by the Word of God.\" And it, in that we... When you're predestinated, why, it has to happen, because it is that. God, God chose you because He knowed what you would do from the beginning. [Romans 8:29-33]\n\nL-209 And don't let the Devil spray you with education and poison, and stuff like that, \"You have to be modern. You have to be this.\" You don't have to be nothing but sons and daughters of God. And if you're borned of the Word, you do. Notice that spray. If you take a seed, a good seed, and you spray it, it'll--it'll kill it. And when they spray this denominational stuff over the top of you, it'll ruin the influence of the original Word. If they tell you, \"You have to do this. Why, the other girls do it. The other men do it.\" Don't you believe that. It'll ruin God's influence of His Word upon you. You know that. [Mark 7:7-13]\n\nL-210 Our text says, \"Don't be conformed,\" sprayed, \"but be transformed,\" the seed that's in you.\n\nL-211 People of today act like they don't even believe there is a God. Did you know that? They act like that. Now, I don't want to call them fools, but they act like it. Cause, Psalms 14:1 says, \"The fool hath said in his heart, \"There is no God.\" You shouldn't call a person a fool. But they certainly act like they are, 'cause they don't... They act like there is no God. This Word is just ignored. [Psalms 14:1]\n\nL-212 Look, here the other day, they called me over in the room to watch... Billy Paul, I believe, or some of them, had said there was a--a religious program on the television. We don't have television. There won't be one in my home, never. But there was a... You want them, that's up to you. But God told me not to do it.\n\nL-213 And when we moved in there, I rented from this sweet old sister up there, she had a television 'cause they had to have it for her to rent her house. And I let them look at a religious program, so they--they called and said there was a 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min Gospel singing on.\n\nL-214 And you talk about a bunch of Rickies, up there act like they did, call themselves Gospel singers! It was a discredit to Jesus Christ, to see the way they was carrying, shaking themselves, and--and these Rickified hair cuts and everything, you know. Just, it just--it just looked--it just looked like it was a mockery!\n\nL-215 Cain was such a person, religious in deed, certainly. But he had the wrong seed in him, see, and therefore it brought forth the serpent's seed. Satan had hissed over this seed of Eden, and that's what brought forth a Cain. He put his poison upon it.\n\nL-216 He, Cain, knew the perfect will of God. He knew the perfect will of God. Cain knew it. Why? But, he refused to do it, he proved then to be the serpent's seed. When he seen the perfect will of God, he refused it. He had seen God vindicate Abel's message. He knowed that was the will of God. See? He seen God vindicate Abel's message. And what did God say to him? And He just, He said, \"Do the same, do worship like your brother, and--and you'll do well.\" But did he... He seen the perfect will of God, but he didn't want it. See, he wanted to add something to it. [Genesis 4:6-7]\n\nL-217 And these theologians see this Bible, they read It, but they don't want to do It. See? It shows the serpent's seed. They have seen It vindicated, and so simply before the people, but it seems like it's so hard for people to humble themselves to the Word of God.\n\nL-218 Don't you all find, when you're talking, you women, to girls, about wearing long hair, and they say, \"Why you got your hair long?\" See? \"Why do you wear your skirts down, long?\" You go to talking to them, they kind of give you the shoulder. Isn't that right? See, they know that's right, if there--if there is any lady in them. See? They know that's right. But, you see, they can't humble themselves to That. See, that's what.\n\nL-219 See how Cain did? He couldn't humble himself to the vindicated Word of God. He couldn't do it.\n\nL-220 Oh, even the Pentecostal say, \"Glory to God! Hallelujah! I cut my hair, and speak in tongues!\" Huh! That shows right there there is something wrong, see, the seed is bringing forth something different. [I Corinthians 11:5, 15]\n\nL-221 A Seed cannot. A Seed of God cannot bring forth a bob-haired woman. It cannot do it. Just can't do it, 'cause the Bible said so. See, It can't do it. No, sir. Now it seems so hard to humble to God's Word.\n\nL-222 Notice it in Genesis 4:6 and 7, just reading off some Scripture here. \"Do as Abel did.\" He said, \"If you--you see what your brother...\" Said, \"Go ahead and do what Abel did, do the same kind of a service that he did, and--and I will bless you. If you don't, sin layeth at the door.\" Now, sin is \"unbelief.\" \"If you don't do as Abel did! You seen I've vindicated him, and made him right. Now if you don't do that, then it shows that--that sin, unbelief, lays at the door.\" See? [Genesis 4:5-8]\n\nL-223 And today they see what God vindicates. They see what God is a-doing. They see all these things happening. They know about it. God is showing His signs in the heaven above and on earth below, and all these things like that, and they see what is taking place. But they won't do it. See, Satan, serpent's seed; smart, come out of seminaries, educated to the spot, every word, every everything, stand in the pulpit just as correct, and every word has to be exactly, the grammar has to be right, and everything that. See? Sure, they can't humble themselves down, a guy like that. See, they just can't do it. They don't. They just can't do it. [Acts 2:19], [Joel 2:30]\n\nL-224 Now, \"If not, sin lies at the door; unbelief lays,\" then he become willfully disobedient. \"And when you know to do good, and do it not, to you it's sin,\" if you know what's right and you don't do it. See? Then he become willfully disobedient after the Word had been vindicated, then he crossed the separating line, then he was ousted from Eden when he crossed. There is a line to where you just go so far, and, if you would go any further over on the other side, you're out. You know that, don't you? There is a line. If you don't believe it, you read Hebrews 10:26. That's the Scripture I was referring to there, see. For if we sin wilfully after... we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin, [Hebrews 10:25-27] 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min\n\nL-225 That's the New Testament. Is that right? \"If we sin willfully after we receive the Knowledge that's been preached to you, read to you, proved to you; after we see the knowledge of the Truth, and you go ahead and unbelieve, willfully, there is no more sacrifice for sin.\" But a... fearful looking... to the fiery indignation, who shall devour the adversary. [Hebrews 10:26, 27]\n\nL-226 Is that right? You can cross that line. Like the children of Israel did in their journey, coming through the wilderness, Israel did the same. After they heard Moses' message and seen it vindicated; listened to a false prophet that said, \"Oh, now look, children, we're all the same. We should marry one among another, and we should do this.\" And Moses had told them different, and seen God vindicate it. Because, Balaam seemed to be a more instructive man than Moses was, see. He had come from a great nation where there was great people, and was all organized together, the land of Moab, great armies, and great things that the people in them days would have feared. And here come a prophet down, a prophet, anointed one, false anointed one, see, come down to an anointed one (look how close), and taught the people, and many of them went after that. Don't you never forget that. See, went after the thing that wasn't the Word, the vindicated proven Word!\n\nL-227 Don't let someone come in here and tell you something different. Watch what God is vindicating and proving.\n\nL-228 Now if them people looked back, and say, \"Moses! God appeared in the skies. And the man spoke into existence, fleas, flies, frogs; took out of existence, boils and diseases. Opened up the Red Sea, and we come... And fed us manna out of heaven. Oh, that's our prophet!\"\n\nL-229 But here come another prophet down, \"Glory to God! I'm a prophet, too.\" Say, \"Now, you all, I'll tell you. Now, now you understand, I use better grammar than Moses. And I am this way and that way, see,\" and so forth.\n\nL-230 And the first thing you know, they fell for it. And every one of them perished right in the wilderness. Not a one of them lived. They never did. They won't be in Heaven, not one of them. Jesus said.\n\nL-231 They said, \"Our fathers eat manna in the wilderness!\" See, Pentecostal, is right, see, they had really come through all the experiences. \"And our fathers eat manna in the wilderness!\" [John 6:47-50]\n\nL-232 He said, \"And they are, every one, dead.\" Death is \"Eternal separation.\" They'll never rise again, although they had been through all these experiences. Figurative speaking, they had spoke in tongues, and danced in the Spirit, and everything. [John 6:31, 49]\n\nL-233 But when it come to the showdown between the Word between two prophets, one of them on the Word, and the other one off the Word; both of them, prophets. You understand? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] One on the Word, and the other one off the Word; both of them, prophets, proven to be prophets. But one was with the Word, see. False anointed ones in the last days, see. One... Prophets, both of them, prophets; one on the Word and one (one) vindicated by the Word, and the other one was not vindicated by the Word. Cain and Abel, again. See the two, false--false and true? All right.\n\nL-234 But every one of them rottened in the wilderness, and perished. Their souls are dead, and gone. And they were right in the path of duty, going to church and the very things that God ordained them to do, but accepted a false teacher, who wasn't vindicated by the Word, to be proven to be right. Yet, he was the Doctor of Divinity, and whatever more you want to call about a real prophet, but wasn't proved spiritually by the Word and by the signs of God. And they perished in the wilderness; righteous, honorable, religious people, died, and will never be in Heaven. [John 6:31, 49]\n\nL-235 See where we got to walk? Understand? [Congregation says, \"Yes.\"--Ed.] Don't let it slip.\n\nL-236 Same as in the times Noah's seed-Word erected a floating transformation from the earth to the sky. It sounded crazy to the people, to have a little cult like Noah had. And he told them, said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD. God has spoken, and there is coming a rain.\" Science, and the educated and religious of that day, said, \"Look at that old quack. He is getting old, his mind is slipping.\"\n\nL-237 See, but he was right, because he was a vindicated prophet. And then, at the end time, his message was truly 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min vindicated. What would he do? He transformed from the earth to Glory, by an ark, of the Word that he was preaching. It was transformed.\n\nL-238 The scientific spray rotted the rest of them into judgment. They rotted upon the waters of the judgment, of the flood.\n\nL-239 What are people trying to do today, in this great scientific age of education, the Eden church, restored again to its Eden, scientific condition, instead of the Word? Are you exalting the Word of God? Is people trying to exalt the Word of God, or are they trying to exalt themselves? Which is it, wonder? The church.\n\nL-240 His deformed seed, knowledge program, has caused the whole race again, by scientific, to be scientifically ignorant of the Word of God. Scientifically ignorant of the Word of God! That's a big mouthful, isn't it? But, they are. Say, \"It can't be\"?\n\nL-241 It was when Jesus came. The day that Jesus came, them--them man knowed that Word of God, just by letter. Didn't they? Sure. But they were ignorant of Who He was, when they seen God on the wings of a dove, perform and do just exactly what He had said He would do. And He done just what the Word said. \"If I do not the works of My Father, then don't believe Me.\" But He did just as the Word said He would do. And they were scientific man in them days, but scientifically ignorant, to willfully sin. [John 10:37]\n\nL-242 Lust had blinded. They need God's Word to show her, to show her nakedness. In Revelation 3, said, \"I counsel of thee to buy from Me salve, that your eyes might be opened, that you might see your nakedness.\"\n\nL-243 The salve is God's Word, the healing of the eyes that brings you from natural things of the world, and transforms you, by the power of God, into His Presence. Then you see! You say, \"I once was lost, now I'm found. I was blind, but now I see.\" See, it would be different. [Revelation 3:17-18]\n\nL-244 That's what the church's call is today, is, \"I counsel thee to come buy of Me salve for your eyes, that you might be anointed with My salve, and then you'll see.\" [Revelation 3:18]\n\nL-245 Let the Holy Spirit come upon any person that's truly got something down there! A healing comes from the inside. Let that healing come from the Spirit that's in you. If it's a genuine Spirit anointing the genuine Seed, It can't do nothing but bear a son or daughters of God. But the genuine Spirit can come upon a--a cocklebur seed, the rain can fall upon a cocklebur, and it will make it live just the same as It falls upon a wheat and makes it live. \"But by their fruits you know them.\" See? And we're a fruit tree, of God, bearing His Word. [Matthew 7:15-20]\n\nL-246 Jesus said, \"Let a man deny himself, and follow Me. Let him deny his education, deny his knowledge, deny his degrees; take up his cross and follow Me.\" [Mark 8:34]\n\nL-247 People has lost their common thoughts of decency. I'm running little Scriptures down here, just for... I was going to give myself about five minutes on it, ten, see. People has lost their common decency among one another. They are--they are not like they used to be. Man of age, of brothers and I, here, know, and women. People don't act like they used to be. They've lost their common understanding. The--the--the mental--the mental effect it's had upon the people of these modern scientific day that we're living in, has caused people to lose their natural reasonings. They can't regard somebody, a woman, as a sister and a brother. It's something filthy. As soon as they...\n\nL-248 And the women have to dress themself so immoral, to get out amongst people. And they say, \"I'm a good woman.\" Well, what is she putting herself out there like that for? She is blinded. \"Well, if--if your... If one of these sisters here, of--of little age, if your mother or my mother would have walked out on the street, the way one of these women, they would have put her in the insane institution; she didn't even have enough mind to know to put on her clothes. Well, if it was insanity then, it's insanity now. It's still the same type of woman. See? But they've lost all their decency, all their understanding. They've lost theirs. And with modern understanding, with culture and education, \"It's healthier, to be it.\" It's sinful and death! Notice. They are, oh, not like they used to be. When the...\n\nL-249 And notice in the church life. It used to be, in the church life, long ago, when the prophet had something to say, THUS SAITH THE LORD, the people moved. They stayed right with It. They moved. But now, \"I don't like that guy. 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min Vote him out.\" Huh! See? Uh-huh. See, they don't have understanding no more. The people just don't move by the Spirit of God anymore.\n\nL-250 God's Word is His Spirit, and His Word comes to His prophet. And the Word is supposed to transform you from what the things of the world are, into the image of sons and daughters of God. And the Word can only come through these prophets, as they spoke. And it had to be compared with the Word, and show that it was the Word. Then if you accept that Word, It'll transform you; from a son of God, or a daughter... or, from a son of the world, the daughter of the world, to a son and daughter of God. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-251 Look at you in here. How many has had that experience? Every one of us. We've had that experience. Because, It was spoke, It was believed, and the Word came forth and fell into the bed of the heart, and there It growed right out of it. See?\n\nL-252 Transforming yourself, His Holy Spirit transforms the seed Word into Its likeness. Like if a pear tree brings forth a pear, an apple tree an apple, things like that; His Word will bring forth sons and daughters of God. That's what it is supposed to do.\n\nL-253 One day when the world lay in darkness and chaos again, the Spirit of God moved upon, in the predestinated seed. A predestinated seed, the predestinated, it was transformed. It took Isaiah 9: 6.\n\nL-254 Now, that prophet standing there, what a--a man that had a sway over the nations, the people. The religious people of his day believed him; not all of them, they never did. But, this prophet, they had seen that man speak things and it was exactly right. What he said was perfect, and it come to pass. And, here, this man has to stand up before his people, and say, \"A virgin shall conceive,\" oh, out of reason. But, you see, God didn't speak it, Himself, He speaks it through His prophets. Now, there wasn't nothing wrote in the Bible about that, but this prophet stood up, said, \"A virgin shall...\" In Isaiah 9:6, \"Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; His Name shall be called 'Counsellor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God, Everlasting Father.'\" Now if \"a virgin shall conceive,\" that Word was spoke, which was a germ, the bed has to be there to receive it in, someday. He searched through the lands, there wasn't any. He went through the lands, there wasn't any. [Isaiah 7:14]\n\nL-255 And pretty near eight hundred years later, that predestinated seed found a bed, and she come to growing.\n\nL-256 Just like God did at the beginning, \"Let there be light,\" and maybe eight hundred years later come forth the light. \"Let there be a tree,\" it come forth like that again, everything that He said.\n\nL-257 Here is a predestinated seed bringing forth Emmanuel, \"God with us.\" \"And to Him shall the Gentiles seek,\" and That Whom we seek to today, Jesus. You see, predestinated seed! [Isaiah 11:10]\n\nL-258 Satan tried to spray it, like he did Eve. He tried to spray it, but he failed. With His repellent on here, He was a predestinated seed. They couldn't take Him in, to make Him a Pharisee or a Sadducee. They couldn't make Him belong to any organization. He was God's predestinated, spoken Word. Satan couldn't throw his unbelief on Him. He had a repellent on Him. God, spray us with a repellent, is my prayer. That's right. [Ephesians 1:5]\n\nL-259 Then the Spirit moved on Him and sent Him to Calvary, to the cross, to bring Light in this day, and Light to all the predestinated seeds to the Church of this day, transforming sons and daughters of God, into His Presence.\n\nL-260 Don't stumble at the word \"predestination.\" I've went through that, you see. I want to show you, Ephesians 1:5. See, just as you were, look, just as you were in your father; as I said the other night, just as you was in your father at the beginning. If you wasn't, you wouldn't be here. But, you see, it had to go to a bedding ground, in order to bring you forth. And now you're his son, you're his daughter. See, it's a seed. And then if you ever... [Ephesians 1:5] If you are a Christian now, a genuine predestinated seed, you was in God before there was a... You always was in God. The germ of your life, which is an attribute of God, which was His thought.\n\nL-261 Say, for instance, this pretty little lady sitting here, see. God said, \"In the day there will be a girl, her name will be So-and-so. She will be this, thus, and this,\" and even know to this very hour, \"she would sit and listen at the Message, 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min dressed in a red dress.\" See, that was His thought. Whoever your husband is, and whoever he is; and He would bring this together, and you would sit here in--in this--this city at this day. There could be no way for you to fail it, see, because you're growing. And as long as you're seed inside, growing, you have to produce just exactly what the seed said you would do. That's exactly. It's His Word. He keeps His Word. He watches over It.\n\nL-262 You was in your father, as a germ, and you come forth as a daughter; you, you, every one of you, brothers and sisters, you come forth. If you wasn't in your father, then you wouldn't have been here.\n\nL-263 And if you wasn't in God... If you believe the message of the Bible, and the present Message of the day, a vindication of It; the reason you are sitting here, because you were predestinated to set here. You wouldn't have been here, otherwise; you would have been on the street, maybe drunk, some of you; and some of you out here and running around with some other man's wife; and you women out, married, and running around with some other women's husband, or something like that. See, but you were predestinated to be here. See, you can't help it. You have a Father, He is God, and you were a seed. [Ephesians 1:5]\n\nL-264 And when He come to a place, He's got you now to where... You was in Him then, as a thought, now you are a person that can fellowship with Him. See? Like you was in, you was in your fathers, at the beginning, but now you are sons and daughters, so you can fellowship with your parent. Now we're sons and daughters of God, who can fellowship with our Father, God. See, it's just as beautiful! Don't you like that? [Congregation says, \"Yes!\"--Ed.] Then you become like Him. And if we were sons, then you're attributes, and was in His form at the beginning.\n\nL-265 And, remember, if you was in Him at the beginning; and when Jesus, which is God, the Word made flesh and dwelt among us; then you were in Him and stood the insults that He took. You went to Calvary with Him, in Him. You died, in Him. You arose, in Him. And now you are seated together in Heavenly places, in Him. See?\n\nL-266 If I'm an American, I stand all of her shame, I stand all of her glory. Ever what she was, I am. I'm an American citizen. I was... I landed on Plymouth Rock. Yes, sir. Yeah, I landed on Plymouth Rock. I signed the... I was in the hall that morning when they signed the Declaration of Independence. I signed it with them. I'm part of her economy. I signed the Declaration or Independence. That's right. I was with Washington, at Valley Forge, when he crossed the river. I was there that morning. I prayed with him. I was. You were, as an American. If you're an American, you was. For, everything America is, you are. I hoisted the flag--flag on Guam. I helped them do that. I took every fort. I bore her shame, as a revolutionary. Whatever she was, I am.\n\nL-267 And whatever Christ was, I am. What He is, I am. O God! If He is considered a fanatic, so must I be. If He was a--a Beelzebub, by His works of His Spirit, I am too. Whatever He was, I am. Whatever He was, you are. [John 12:26]\n\nL-268 We must be the makers of her immortality, her freedom or her fame, her glory or her shame. We must be that. We must be the Church, the Bride of Jesus Christ. I lived with Him on the earth, when He lived. I died with Him when He died. I rose with Him when He rose. I'm assembled and am seated with Him now in Heavenly places, because I'm part of Him. Wherever He is, there I am. \"Where My servant is, there will I be also.\"\n\nL-269 Now He can fellowship with us and through us, and rest His Word with us. Which, we are a part of His Word. We... If He is the Word, and we are part of Him, then we are part of the Word. And how can I deny I got a hand? No matter how much some idiot would, excuse me, some science would say that--that I haven't got a hand; I got a hand! I know I got a hand. I use it.\n\nL-270 And I know I got a God. I got a Saviour. I feel Him in my soul. I, I'm part of Him. That's what this Word says, that's what I am. And if I deny one part of This, that would be like denying I got an hand, an ear, an eye. I couldn't do it and remain a human being, in my right mind; neither can I deny any of God's Word and remain in my right, the right Spirit of God. I've got to take what the denomination says or what God said about It. See? You cannot do it.\n\nL-271 Now, \"transforming.\" He can transform us through His Word, that we can rest, because we are a part of It.\n\nL-272 And now there is many things, in talking about my natural birth, there is many things in my natural birth that I can't brag on. I'll tell you, I ain't got nothing to brag on. My mother was a sinner, to begin with; my father was a sinner. And they come out of a bunch of cutthroats and gun-fighters, and most of them died with their boots on; drunks and 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min bootleggers, and everything else, out of Kentucky. My mother, a half Indian. And I--I've got nothing to brag on. I can't brag on my family tree.\n\nL-273 But, glory to God, there is one thing I can brag on, my Second Birth, which comes from Jesus Christ. I can brag on that Parent that we have, for He is my Father. He is my Saviour. He is my Redeemer. I can brag on everything that He has--He has done for me, because now I become His son. I am no more a son of Charles Branham, I'm a son of Jesus Christ. That's right. I can brag on my Birth now. I can't brag on my first birth, there is nothing, I'm ashamed of that. But I'm not ashamed of my Second Birth. No, no. I'm not ashamed of my Second Birth. How did He do it? \"By the washing of the water by the Word.\" That's right. [Ephesians 5:26]\n\nL-274 Truly predestinated believers stay with the Word, and they won't pervert It. It can't be perverted. Oh, sons and daughters of God, why can't we have this great fellowship that we ought to have, with all the sons and daughters of God? We should have it. But they just won't do it, that's all, 'cause they're not truly sons and daughters from the...\n\nL-275 See, as I said the other night, I was going to... I had that wrote down here, but I haven't got time to get to it. I'm going to leave it, quit now.\n\nL-276 That little inside of the inside, that's where you start, which is your soul; then come from that, you're a spirit; and then you become a living being. Now, the living being has five senses, to contact; the second has five senses. That's the outside body: see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. The inside body has love and conscience, and so forth, five senses. But the inside of the inside, the control tower, it's either God or Satan.\n\nL-277 And you can mimic any of these things you can contact, like--like the--like the Christian; or you could cast out devils, like a Christian. But the inside control tower, the beginning, the origin, isn't of God, it'll never return to God. You understand it? Did not Judas cast out devils? Did not Caiaphas, the one who condemned Him and put Him to death, even prophesy? But he couldn't stay with the Word. See? That's right.\n\nL-278 Transformed from the church and the world, into sons and daughters of God! Notice this, in closing now.\n\nL-279 And now how the wandering sons of God, wandering out there in the world, some of them this denomination, from denomination to denomination, like wandering stars, never stable. Like a leaf on the water in the autumn. We used to see it, Leo, back in the East there. The leaves would blow down on it, and every little wind would blow it from this side to that side.\n\nL-280 But God wants us to be stabled. \"Anchored in Jesus, the storms of life I'll brave. Anchored in Jesus, I fear no winds or wave,\" see, whatever it is. Many of you remember the Inch Cape bell, when you was in school, boy and girl in school.\n\nL-281 Abraham and Sarah's body was transformed, to meet the condition of the promised Word. See, they were old. Abraham had received the promise, and Sarah, when he was seventy-five, she was sixty-five, past menopause; lived with her since she was a girl, was a half-sister. And, to keep that promise, both of their bodies was transformed, from an old man and woman, to a young man and woman, to meet the promise of the day. [Genesis 18:9-14]\n\nL-282 Glory to God! That makes me feel so good. See? I don't care what I was, I don't care how I come here, we can be transformed to meet the promise of this day. When, we can dwell together in unity and sweetness of the Holy Spirit, and live as brothers and sisters.\n\nL-283 Enoch, his whole body was transformed, to meet a type, in God, and he was taken to Heaven without even seeing death, Enoch was. Elijah done the same. [Genesis 5:24], [Hebrews 11:5]\n\nL-284 Jesus' body was transformed from a dead, cold form, pulped, beat until His bruises and His--His ribs stuck through His back. And--and His heart was run through, with a spear probably that wide, stabbed right through His heart, and Blood and water came. Even the moisture from His body, left, and the Blood run down the spear, and off His feet, and trickled onto the ground. And He was so dead until the moon and stars said He was dead, the earth said He was dead; had a nervous prostration, the--the rocks shook out of the earth, and everything. Everything said He was dead; even God hid His face. He was dead. But His body was transformed. Why? Because God said, \"I'll not leave His soul 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min in hell, neither will I suffer My Holy One to see corruption.\" There is no way to do it. [Psalms 16:10], [Acts 2:27]\n\nL-285 Some of these days, our bodies may be stretched out in a casket. We may come... You may come and look upon me laying in a casket. I may come and look upon you, might have to say the last words over you, or something like that. But you will never keep us in the grave. They may lay rocks over you. They may bury you in the sea. They may do whatever they want to, but the transforming Power of God...\n\nL-286 In II Thessalonians, said, \"I would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning those that are asleep. For we say this to you, too, by the Commandments of the Lord, that the trumpet of God shall sound, and the dead in Christ shall rise first; we which are alive and remain,\" as the song said this morning, \"shall be caught up together with them, to meet the Lord in the air.\" [I Thessalonians 4:13, 15-17]\n\nL-287 The transforming Power of God, that's taken us from the chaos of science and education, and the things of the world, and the understanding of this modern day, has transformed us now into sons and daughters of God. And even death itself can never hold us in the grave. \"We'll be changed, in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye.\" \"Oh, you mean to say?\" [I Corinthians 15:51-53]\n\nL-288 I mean to say that that's the Truth! Jesus, that Word stood on the earth, which was the Word, the One that was raised up, and raised Lazarus. He said, \"I am the Resurrection and Life; he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die.\" There is no way to stop the living Word of God! It's got to rise again. [John 11:25]\n\nL-289 And from out of this chaos of this modern scientific Eden that we're living in, of culture and--and science and education, all this modern stuff, we'll rise! \"This robe of flesh we'll drop, and rise and seize the everlasting prize,\" someday. We'll go through the air, and this will all be over. For the Word of God that's brought us from the modern thinking of our mind, transforming our mind into the renewing of our hearts towards God, and our spirits; that same Spirit that spoke that, has transformed us this far, and It also will take us into His Presence, into His Glory, with a glorified body. [I Corinthians 15:51-54]\n\nL-290 \"They shall build houses, they shall inhabit them. They shall plant vineyards.\" In all of our scientific search; we plant a garden, our sons come along and take the fruit from it, and his sons comes and takes it from him. And they plant, and another one eats; and they build, and another inhabit. \"But long will be the days of My servants, they will be there and their offsprings with them. They will build, and another will not inhabit. They'll plant, and not another eat thereof.\" What? The very God, the very prophet that the Word of God said \"a virgin shall conceive,\" promised us this! [Isaiah 65:17, 21-22]\n\nL-291 How do we get it? We are potentially there right now, see, because God said so. It has to be. When He raised Lazarus there, said, \"Don't think this is strange, for the hour is coming when all that's in the grave will hear the Voice of the Son of man, and shall come forth; some to shame, and some to Life.\" [John 5:25, 27-29]\n\nL-292 What is it? Transforming, transforming by the Word of God, making us sons and daughters of God, and will also give us Life in the world to come. Oh, my! What more could I say? Listen not to other things. Covet not this world's vain riches, That so rapidly decay, Build your hopes on things Eternal, They will never pass away. Hold to God's unchanging hand! (Let's sing it!) Hold to God's unchanging hand! (Here it is!) Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God's unchanging hand! When our journey is completed, If to God we have been true, Bright and fair our home in Glory, 65-1031M, Power Of Transformation, Pine Lawn Trailer Park, Prescott, AZ, 122 min Our enraptured soul shall view. Hold to God's unchanging hand! (Be transformed!) Hold to God's unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God's unchanging hand!\n\nL-293 Don't notice science, what it can prove, if it's contrary to the Word. See? Don't notice the church, what it says, if it's contrary to the Word. For we hold to God's unchanging hand!\n\nL-294 Times change, science changes. Hold that Hand that can't change! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God's unchanging hand.\n\nL-295 Father God, in the Presence of You, as we assemble here this morning in this, taking a lengthy, long, drawed-out Message, and, O Lord, I pray that You will place them Seeds out in the hearts of these people. Remember, Lord, we pray, that we are frail, and our structure is frail, and we... sometimes we don't know which a way to turn. Dear God, You turn us and lead us by Thy great Spirit, Lord. Help us. Never leave us alone, Father. You promised You wouldn't. \"I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee. I'll be with thee.\"\n\nL-296 And, Father God, we pray that You will guide our Brother Leo, and Gene. Make them, Lord, the kind of a leaders that You would have over this people here; not using their own thoughts, but let the great Holy Spirit direct them in what to do.\n\nL-297 Bless these men and women, these young children, like, Lord, to me. And I--I--I pray that You will keep them in long life. Let, if it be possible, Lord, let us live to see His Coming. We believe we will, because we see everything is so close now. It's so close! Grant it, Father. We commit them to You, with ourselves, now, to serve You, in Jesus' Name. Amen. I'm sorry I kept you that long. Brother Leo. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

It's a privilege. A greeting to Brother and Sister Green, and all that's here this morning. And it is a privilege that I feel I have given to me, to come to this place of worship, to make a few announcements.\n\nL-2 I don't want to take Brother Green's time here, because I heard Brother Green several times, speak, and I certainly was influenced, and as he brought the Word of the Lord to us, and so humble about it. Yesterday he said, \"I don't get the Word from the Lord as maybe It would come in revelation, as--as It's been sent, but,\" said, \"I like to--to stress upon what has been said.\" He said, \"Like when Paul wrote something in the Bible, I come here to stress upon what he said.\" Said, \"I have no message, only just to stress on what's already been said from the Lord.\" I thought it's really remarkable, a--a young fellow like that, and hear him make a remark like that. [I Corinthians 11:4] Now let's just have a word of prayer together.\n\nL-3 Dear God, I hardly know how to start, for I feel You are here today, and in Your Presence we always feel so little. And I--I thank You for this privilege. Now, Lord, that Thou has granted this place to us, we pray that You will meet with us every time that we meet here. And may Your Great Spirit move over this city! May we be able to bring this Gospel Message that has been given to us and presented to our hands in this last days, may It be fulfilled, and You get every soul out of Tucson and around about, that You've ordained to Life. Grant these things, Father, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. [Acts 13:48]\n\nL-4 I think I want to read a little verse of Scripture here this morning, just before I say these words that I wish to say. It's found over in Acts, the 7th chapter of the Book of Acts. And while you're turning to that, we'll begin at the 44th verse. [Acts 7:44]\n\nL-5 Now we're going to Shreveport this week, this coming week, for a series of services, and now we're going to try, if the Lord willing. Brother Moore, Brother Jack Moore, a very good friend of both Brother Pearry and I, and we love Brother Jack. The Message, I think, kind of baffled him a little, especially on some of the things that we hold dear and believe, that--that It came to us through the opening of the Seven Seals, as we believe It, such as, \"serpent's seed,\" and \"Eternal security of the believers,\" and--and so forth, some of those Messages. That, maybe to others... We don't think This is hard, but, It, you've got to open your heart to Truth. We believe that we're living in the--the end time. That's just so real to us, that we're just at the end of the road. [Genesis 3:15], [Hebrews 6:4], [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-6 And to speak in some other man's church, well, you want to honor that man's hospitality, of--of giving you that opportunity to come into his church. And I, certainly, knowing that they don't believe in That, and I would honor them enough that... There is plenty more that I can speak on there, besides bringing That in; unless it's just the Holy Spirit happen to push It a little, you see, then I would certainly say as He said. And I don't know no better than to do that, and I hope I never learn any better than to do that. See? Let's just say It the way He says It.\n\nL-7 Now let us read just a--a verse or two here out of the--the 7th chapter of the Book of Acts, beginning with the 44th verse. Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he has appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen. Which also our father that came after brought in with Jesus unto the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David; Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. But Solomon built him a house. Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, Heaven is my throne,... earth is my footstool: what house will you build me: saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest? Has not my hands made all these things? [Acts 7:44-50] 65-1121, What House Will You Build Me?, Tucson Tabernacle, Tucson, AZ, 27 min\n\nL-8 Upon This, the reading of this Scripture, I want to say the few words that I want to say before Brother Pearry brings the morning message.\n\nL-9 I find this one of the great moments of my visit to Tucson. I come here because that I was led to come here. I come here because that the Holy Spirit, through a vision, sent me here. I know that might seem strange, maybe. But He, as far as I know, anything that I know of God, I was sent by a vision to Tucson. I've wondered how I ever was sent to this desert place. And then here where there is...\n\nL-10 Spiritually speaking, over the city, I don't know of any place that's any more spiritual dead, than in the city of Tucson. There is war between the churches. There is fusses between the congregations. There is no unity, and everyone grabbing, and holding, and squeezing, and trying to get this one, and proselyting. It is a desert, spiritually speaking, also. [I Corinthians 3:4-6]\n\nL-11 But then I read in the Bible, that where God called Moses away from his loved ones and all that was dear to him, and sent him into the wilderness, to write the Laws of the Bible. That was the Old Testament, the first four Books, Genesis, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy, Exodus. He... I never said them just in routine, but that's four Books. That really is the Old Testament. Because, the rest of It was what the prophets said, in the Psalms of David, and so forth, but the Chronicles of the kings. But this was the fundamentals of the Old Testament. Was Moses wrote them after he was called from his homeland, where he had been born and brought up among his people, and was sent into the desert, to write this Book of the Old Testament. [Exodus 3:10]\n\nL-12 Then I find that in the Book of the New Testament, where Paul, which is the author, or not the author, but the writer of the New Testament. He also was drove out from among his people, and, by the Spirit, into Arabia, where he was three and a half years, to find the inspiration. And Paul is the chief writer of the New Testament. Now, there is Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, but they were scribes that just wrote what Jesus said as they followed Him along. And, but, you take the Book to Timothy, and to the Romans, and to the Hebrews, and so forth, Paul received inspiration to write the New Testament; taking all the Old Testament as a shadow, and setting it in order. And God honored it, and made it the New Testament. [Galatians 1:17-18]\n\nL-13 And now if the Old Testament had to be drove from the... the writer had to be drove from his people, into the wilderness, to get inspiration to write the Old Testament. And in the New Testament, the writer was drove by the Author, into a desert place, to get the inspiration to write the New Testament. And the Books are sealed with Seven Seals; it would also require the same, I believe, in these days, to open those Seven Seals. To leave what you hold dear, to what you cherish, and a little home that was given me by the people, and amongst all my people and friends, and a church that was flourishing, and had nothing lacking; and to--to leave that, pull right away from it, and move away, out into a desert where you knew nobody, and everything against you. [Revelation 5:1-5]\n\nL-14 But there is something about God, that He drives a man to do things that's beyond any thinking of his own, so it can be to the glory and honor of God. And I feel that, not self honor, but I--I feel it a privilege that it was to leave everything that was called dear to me, to get here into this wilderness and suffer like I have never suffered in my life, here in this wilderness, or this desert. But I believe, that in doing that and obeying what God commanded to be done, God has opened to us the mysteries of this last day. And we are here with this Message.\n\nL-15 Now, there was many people who followed me, and that's not unusual. Usually a person we... The people love one another, and it, love, will drive you to do things you don't think you would do. And many of you left your homes, you left all, just to go, come out here in the desert.\n\nL-16 Many has called me, many has asked me, \"Shall we come to Arizona? Would it be a good place for us?\" Well, as it was said about Moses and them, it was no place of fruit, no place of pomegranate.\n\nL-17 Here there is not much work to do, and living is high, and the cost of living is high. It's really a rough place to live, is Tucson, Arizona; wages are poor, and--and food is high, and rent. It's--it's a horrible place to live, in that manner. But it's healthy, it's dry. And we sometimes... We mustn't get our minds fashioned on things of this earth. [Colossians 3:2] 65-1121, What House Will You Build Me?, Tucson Tabernacle, Tucson, AZ, 27 min\n\nL-18 We must look to a leading of the Holy Spirit. But one thing that troubled me in coming here, and telling people, well, \"you should not come\" or \"you should come,\" that I leave up to each individual, the way God leads that individual to do. I think every one of us should do that, be led by the Spirit, on what to do. [Romans 8:14]\n\nL-19 And many of you here are from around Jeffersonville, and of the congregation there, and you have come out here. Now, the thing that bothered me, was a place of worship.\n\nL-20 And I realize, as I read in the Scripture here, of Stephen and his address just before his death; for they stoned him immediately afterwards, for his message. As he was speaking, he said, \"our fathers,\" talking of the Hebrews in the early day, how that they tried to find favor before God, to build a place for worship. He said that, \"Solomon built Him a house, or a building.\" We are acquainted with the story. [Acts 7:47]\n\nL-21 But I like his next words, \"Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in houses that's made with hands,\" and another place over in Isaiah. He said, \"'A body has Thou prepared Me; see, sacrifice and offerings, and buildings, and so forth, but a body has Thou prepared Me.'\" Well, we realize that he was speaking then of the body where God tabernacled, in Christ. [Hebrews 10:5], [Acts 7:48]\n\nL-22 But I believe today, that the inspiration has come to--to Brother Green, to move here, him and Sister Green, giving up their place back in the east, also, too, back in Texas, to come here with... to start with nothing; just simply by an inspiration, feeling that they should do it. I appreciate men that will follow the leading of Christ, regardless of the cost it costs them. [Romans 8:14]\n\nL-23 Though the whole world, maybe your very best friends, think that you're wrong, but it isn't wrong to you. As long as you feel there is something behind it, it's God moving you; it's never wrong, and it'll always pan out right.\n\nL-24 See this young couple, a talented young man. I ain't saying this because he is sitting here. And this young lady with her babies, with his family to raise, and he has quit his job and everything, to move here.\n\nL-25 I realize that years ago I was called in the ministry. I've never made a successful pastor, because I got a roaming, rambling spirit. I can't be satisfied anywhere. Just wherever the Spirit moves, I've just got to move with It, because I have a Message. Jesus said, \"I must preach in this other town also.\" [Luke 4:43]\n\nL-26 But there are those who are shepherds that watch the flock. I'm so grateful that Brother Pearry followed the leading of the Holy Spirit, and today we have a tabernacle. It's a small one. That's just good enough to start with, to see what the Holy Spirit... Not knowing, let's just move step by step. Now, I believe, if God has spoke to Brother and Sister Green, to come here, and has opened up a place where our children; instead of on Sunday morning riding their bicycles, and on the streets and running around, they have a place to come to worship, instead of us sitting around and listening to something that we've heard on radio, which is all right. [Romans 8:14]\n\nL-27 But we, as this group of people, we have a Message for this day. We, we believe that God has given us a Message. And Brother Green, is, I don't want to call him my associate, because we are... Well, it is, also, my associate, we are together in this Message. Brother Green preaches the same thing and Message that I believe in. He has left his home, he has left his people, he has left his church. He was, I believe, he was a district superintendent or something, of one of the organizations, and give the whole thing up when he heard This. He left everything that was dear to him, also, to come to the desert, just to support what God is giving to us now.\n\nL-28 I say I believe it's not only should be in our heart, it should be our duty to back him up, everything that we can, to attend the services, to come here to worship, and to make this a place where God can reveal to us the things that He has for us to reveal. And as his word said, \"The Message doesn't come to me through the giving of the inspiration, as it does to maybe to some of us, but,\" he said, \"I am here to back up what God has given.\" What a statement! And I believe, if we will all cooperate together, we'll put our hearts to it.\n\nL-29 I know that each one of you, if you feel like I do, I am so hungry to see the Spirit of God moving, I just can't hardly stand it. Some experiences I just had up in the mountain, just to feel that once again, that Something that when I was first saved was so glorious to my heart! And we can come into a place, we can sit and we see it among us, that we 65-1121, What House Will You Build Me?, Tucson Tabernacle, Tucson, AZ, 27 min are drying. As we sit here in the desert, I get among my brethren, they talk with me and I talk with them; always, in a little way of watching, feeling out there with the Spirit, as it was, to see just the condition of that brother, to see what's wrong. I begin to feel us all reclining, getting away from the Spirit. It's become too natural a thing to us. We must worship in the Spirit, where the Spirit of God... Not only our Message should be the flame of the hour, it should be the flame in our hearts. See? It's got to be in our hearts, or we can't--we can't rightly present It to the people. The Spirit has to pack the Message, Itself. And I'm trusting and believing in every one of you, to be a real Christian. [John 4:23-24], [Philippians 3:3]\n\nL-30 Now they need Sunday school teachers. They're going to need a staff. And I want to say this so that you will thoroughly understand. This is my church.\n\nL-31 I've been here three years. And I had one door open to me, that was Brother Mack asked me to come preach. God bless him. I haven't been invited by any other people; not nothing against them, they're alright. Brother Brock, a good friend of mine, Brother Gilmore, many of these Pentecostal brethren here, are very, very deep good friends of mine. I love them; nothing against them. I understand their position. They can't invite me in there, and them remain in their organization. See, they can't do it. Because, if they do, they're kicked out. So you see their position. I had the same thing to face. But now may it always be, \"Seek ye first the Kingdom of God,\" the will of God. [Matthew 6:33]\n\nL-32 And now that, Brother Green, God has sent him in here and opened us up a church of like precious Faith that we believe in, we ought to be very grateful to God, and attend every service, take every place that we can. And if we are asked and called on, to pray, to seek, to do, let's be soldiers right at the... just anxious to do it. See? [II Peter 1:1]\n\nL-33 Keep the Message honorable, and live the right kind of life. Don't let no smut come upon It. We're living too late now. We're--we're too late in the hour. Let's live It clean. Or, my life, your life, all of our lives needs to be picked up, before God.\n\nL-34 Our young people just ride around, from place to place, from show to show, and drifting further and further away from God. Right. Now, that's the truth. I see it in my children, and I see myself getting to a place where not... You, you've got to assemble ourselves together, to worship God; the Bible said so, \"When we see this day approaching, that much more come together.\" If there is only two people here, you be one of them. Now that's... And if we come together and worship together, then we just, something another about it, Jesus said, \"Where two or three are gathered in My Name, there I am in their midst.\" [Matthew 18:20], [Hebrews 10:25]\n\nL-35 Now, as I've said before, Brother Green told me, and he said it. My wife come, told me what he said when I was away. That, and he said this morning, that, \"The pulpit was open at any time.\" Now usually... That's, open for me to speak.\n\nL-36 Now, usually, I had to drive all the way to Jeffersonville, Indiana, to give a Message that God gave me, to bring it to the people; go all the way to Jeffersonville, Indiana, and each one of you stringing across the country, and hooking up the wires and things, to get the Message, because that's what we're living on. See, that's what we're here for. Well, we don't have to do that no more.\n\nL-37 God gives me a Message, I can walk right here to the pulpit and preach it, and feel free to do it. See? And I believe, by that, that God Almighty will bless you if you will just stand by this church now, this group of people. Not only that, but let's go out and see if we can't get others to come in. See, let's speak to others everywhere, speak to them about our church and what it means. What our church... We're here. We want you to come, bring in strangers, and I'm sure it will be good for all of us. See? We have a building, which we are thankful for. We're thankful for this place, to gather together.\n\nL-38 But, \"Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, see, 'For Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool; and where is the place of My rest? But a body has Thou prepared Me.'\" [Acts 7:48-49]\n\nL-39 And we are a Body of Christ. So as we move from one building to another building, I believe, in bringing our Messages, and we'll come down and have healing services. And anything the Lord reveals to us to do, we'll have it right here in the church, until it swells out so big you'll have to take it somewhere else, and somewhere else, until Jesus 65-1121, What House Will You Build Me?, Tucson Tabernacle, Tucson, AZ, 27 min comes. God bless you. [I Corinthians 12:27]\n\nL-40 [Brother Pearry Green comments, and then asks for Brother Branham to ordain him--Ed.] Bow our heads.\n\nL-41 Dear God, as we stand here on this platform, which represents, right over the altar here, we realize that we are a--a dying race of people, as far as this earth is concerned. We look out upon the streets and see sin wrote everywhere, and that the Glory of the Lord is swiftly departing. And we know, when the Glory of the Lord goes up, so will the Church go with It. God, we want to be there. Just a few days ago, standing here on the street corner, just across the street, watching that parade go down the street; and seeing those old First War tanks leading the way, then come the big heavy Sherman tank, behind that followed on and on and on, then the gold-star mothers; the little broke-up family, with a crying wife, and a little ragged boy lost his daddy, an old mother had lost a son. Oh, how sad to stand on the street corner and watch something like that pass! Then noticing, just as they passed this building, the music changed to \"Onward, Christian Soldiers.\" Playing their marches, behind; but when they passed this spot!\n\nL-42 Dear God, I'm thinking of another great time coming, and that will be the resurrection, when the old-timers will come forth first, saints, the patriarchs. \"For we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep; for the trumpet of God shall sound, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.\" Then when we see that great... just those people going, marching up through the skies; and we'll be standing, waiting for our change, knowing that we'll fall in line, also. God, make us faithful soldiers. [I Thessalonians 4:15]\n\nL-43 Only those who have really associated and been in the war would know what that really meant, to see those tanks rolling by. And, God, we think that those who have been in the battle of life will know what it means, when we're waiting our turn to fall in position and place, in the resurrection, to go up.\n\nL-44 And this, my young brother, standing here, well trained, ready, dressed, waiting for an old man to lay hands upon him, one who is an old veteran been up there in the front line, knowing that he must join the battle, too. Dear God, with these unworthy hands I lay upon my brother, in representation of Yours. Bless Brother Green, dear God, who I bless in Jesus' Name. May he carry this Message, Lord, into this city and wherever You'll call him. May he be loyal, filled with the Spirit, living a life above reproach. God, let him have the hearts of the people, that he might teach them and lead them and direct them in the path that we all desire to walk. Grant it, Lord.\n\nL-45 Bless his faithful wife, his little children. Bless our efforts here together, as Christian brothers here on earth, that we must carry this Gospel to the ends of the world. Send Your Spirit upon him, God. We pray in Jesus Christ's Name, as we give him to You. Amen. God bless you, Brother Pearry. Carry the Word of God! [Matthew 24:14] Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P.

So it's a... We're glad to be here. I believe, the last time here, I told you: each time we come, there is someone missing. And if we shall come back next year, the Lord tarries, there'll be somebody missing.\n\nL-2 One was very, very close to me in heart, spirit. That was Brother Lyle. I've always had a welcoming, coming in, standing back there and listen, in Brother Jack's study, of the old quartet singing. They're singing in Glory, tonight. Well, there's one of those voices already over There, waiting for the other three. I guess I'll never hear it here on earth no more. But I certainly am looking forward to hearing it again, Brother, Sister Moore here, in that Land where they'll... it'll never be dimmed.\n\nL-3 Brother Palmer was a great servant of Christ. I can remember Brother Jack telling me about his--his dedicated life to God. They were carpenters, together. And said he would be eating his--his lunch, have his sandwich in his hand, eating a sandwich and reading his Bible. See? He done some mighty great things, Brother Palmer did. He's a good carpenter, a good father to his children, a lovely family. He raised them all to serve the Lord. As far as I know, they're all saved and filled with the Holy Ghost. And that's a great contribution to any man in these days, boys and girls. But, see, all that he ever done won't amount to too much until serving God, lest he served God. And tonight, what he had done here on earth, his good deeds, he's gone to his reward, to be with them. God rest the soul of our brother. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-4 I know, as long as this is a tabernacle here, and I--I know he'll... his voice will still be here. You can hear it. Sister Anna Jeanne and--and her sister, playing the organ and piano, how they never had to wait. Brother Palmer just stand here and he just pick the song up, go on. They'd catch it. And I never... I looked forward to hearing him lead the song.\n\nL-5 To his children; to his wife; and to Brother Jack, his bosom friend, they been friends for all these years; and Brother Brown, Sister Brown, all you tabernacle: God bless you. I miss him, too. God rest his gallant soul, until we meet him in peace. Let us bow our head.\n\nL-6 Gracious Heavenly Father, just speaking of this great servant, I missed him, tonight, him shaking my hands, and that cunning little smile he always had when he said, \"God bless you, Brother Branham,\" when we'd walk in the door. I know he's come up to Your House, tonight. So I pray, dear God, that You'll let the fruits, his works that follow him, be great, continuing on with his children, his wife. We pray that You'll bless her, Lord. You said You would be a husband to \"the widows that were widows indeed.\" I pray for our Sister Palmer and for all the children. I know how to sympathize with both, losing a companion and also losing my dad. So, Father, while we're here, tonight, we pray that You'll prepare our hearts, also, for that hour. We don't know. It might come as sudden as his did. We don't know when it will come, but we know it's got to come. So we pray, God, that You'll search every heart that's in here, tonight. God, don't leave mine out. Search mine, too, and try me. Lord, if there be any evil in us, take it out. We want to serve You. That's our full objective, is to serve You. Pour out Your Spirit upon us, tonight, and the rest of this week. Bless this tabernacle by the name of the Life Tabernacle. May it receive full blessings of that name and be full of the Life of God, this week, to save every lost soul, to fill every believer with the Holy Ghost, and renew the hopes that's in us, Lord, again. We pray that You'll also heal all the sick and the afflicted that comes among us. May Your great Holy Spirit be here, Lord, and just heal. And anoint each one to believe. Grant these things, Father.\n\nL-7 God, help me now. If it fall, has fall my turn to bring the Message. I pray, God, that You'll just let the man part stand to one side. May the Holy Spirit come in and move upon us, Lord. May the Holy Ghost take the meeting, Lord. We know that we're so insufficient. We could not do it, none of us. We don't claim to be able to do it. But, Lord, we know that Thou art the One. So we're looking to Thee, Lord. Move, Spirit of God, and fall fresh on us. We ask in Jesus' Name. Amen. 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min\n\nL-8 Now I want to pass greetings on down the line, to the churches now that's hooked up across the state. We're on the telephone hookup, which is a fine little system that we have been able to get, through our Brother Pearry Green from Beaumont, Texas. And the churches, completely, that's following the Message, all the way across the United States, is hooked up, tonight. We send greetings, up and down the West Coast, all the way from Vancouver down to Tijuana, Mexico, through San Jose, Los Angeles. All the groups over in there, we greet you from Shreveport. Also, all the way to Prescott, Arizona, to the group up there that's waiting on the Lord, we send greetings to you, and to Tucson, also Sierra Vista. All the way to New York, up and down, across the nation, the Lord bless you, each one. Wish you were here, tonight, this beautiful old state of Louisiana, where it seems like a second home, to me. I...\n\nL-9 You know, you people up in New York, you all kind of laugh at you a little bit, the way you talk. I'm right at home tonight. Yeah. Everybody down here, you know, they said, \"Hello, d'ere, Brother Branham. You bring Sister Branham and all the young'ns and come over to see us.\" Oh, my! That makes me feel good. That's real English, to me. Not disregarding you people in the east and the north, and different places. But, you know, I guess I was just born an old Reb' and have to stay that way. I--I kind of like it, myself. It's real English.\n\nL-10 I was at a Business Men's breakfast, here not long ago, and they said, \"We will now stand and sing the national anthem.\" And I stood up, said, \"For my old Kentucky home, far away.\" Well, to me, that was the national anthem, all I knowed about it. So, we send you greeting. Now to the...\n\nL-11 I believe they're going to try to broadcast the breakfast, also, the Business Men's breakfast, Saturday morning. Brother Green will tell you, as he's at the microphones out there now. So he'll tell you what time the breakfast starts, and what time, each night, to tune in. We thank you very kindly. Pray for us.\n\nL-12 Now, to the local assembly here, and Brother Jack's tabernacle, I just going to ask you a favor, tonight. Being that I was going to give my thanksgiving Message across the--the nation, tonight, to our local churches that's following the Message. In this, I--I may be a little lengthy. And then, again, I may preach some Doctrine. So, if so, and you don't agree with It...\n\nL-13 Just like I always said about eating cherry pie, when I run into a seed. I don't throw the pie out. I throw the seed out, just keep on eating pie. So if I happen to mention something tonight, I... Well, that's one reason I took this invitation, tonight, to be here, to bring my thanksgiving Message to the groups across the country, was because Brother Jack always so freely open his door and says, \"Preach what's on your heart.\" So I feel real at home.\n\nL-14 So it may be that in here, in the local assembly here with Brother Jack, there might be ministers and some people that would disagree with Doctrine. Usually I have the courtesy not to mention doctrine in a man's pulpit, that has invited me to come speak for him. So, after tonight, I suppose I'll just be praying for the sick and doing the regular service. But I thought I would let you know beforehand, that if something that I say that might be disagreeable, why, just allow it to my ignorance, I guess, and know no better. And pray for me.\n\nL-15 So now let us turn in the Word, to a chapter here. I wish to refer to many places tonight, because I've got several Scriptures and little notes wrote out here in a tablet.\n\nL-16 I remember the first time I climbed on the platform at Life Tabernacle, twenty years ago. I--I didn't have to write down my Scriptures and reference. I was just twenty years younger then. But now I've done passed twenty-five, so I... the second time. So I've... can't remember it like I used to. I have to write my Scriptures down, and sometimes brief down something another I want to refer to.\n\nL-17 And now the Lord bless as we read out of God's Word, and the Book of Romans, the 7th chapter. Now, I want to kind of teach this like a Sunday school lesson.\n\nL-18 I know there is people standing. And at the tabernacle, usually, at Jeffersonville, we want to greet you all, tonight, too, know that you're hooked up there at the tabernacle. And looks like be at the tabernacle, tonight, if you were down here, the people around the walls, and overflowed. Now, I suppose you're that way, too, all the people that's up in that part of the country, that come in for the Message. 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min\n\nL-19 Now we are going to use this like a Sunday school lesson. And it's not directed to anything, any certain persons, or anything; just to the Church, the Body of Christ that we're trying to lead to deeper thoughts and higher objectives, believing that the Coming of the Lord Jesus is at hand. We believe that. Much more, it's twenty years closer than it was the first time I come to Shreveport. Oh, so much has happened since that time! Now we're looking forward for the Coming of the Lord, in our generation. I'm not looking for revival in our generation. I'm looking for the Coming of the Lord, in our generation. [I Peter 4:7]\n\nL-20 Now in Romans 7. Trusting that you have your Bibles open, everywhere now, across the country. We want to read closely now. This--this Message out of here, it seems like it's on marriage and divorce, but it really isn't. To me, it's a prophecy for the Church in the last day. Let us read. Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he liveth? For the woman which has a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then if, while her husband liveth, she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be joined or should be married to another, even to him who is risen from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the flesh,... motions of sin, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. [Romans 7:1-5]\n\nL-21 And now let us pray. Dear God, we have just read what we believe to be the sacred Word of God. And that's what we are believing, that not one jot or one tittle shall in nowise pass from This until all is fulfilled. And we believe that our Lord told us, in Revelations the 22nd chapter, that, \"Whosoever shall take one Word from It or add one word to It, the same, his part, will taken from the Book of Life.\" [Revelation 22:18-19] And we see that, by misrepresentation of this Word, as Satan misrepresented It to Eve, caused her to doubt one Word, threw the whole human race into a fallen chaos. Just one Word! [Genesis 3:1-4] Then we see in the middle of the Book, came our Lord and Saviour, and He gave us this quotation concerning It. \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" [Matthew 4:4] Then the solemn warning in the last Book, of the Revelation of Jesus Christ, \"Whosoever shall add a word or take a Word away, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.\" [Revelation 22:18-19] O God, knowing, seeing how fragile we are, knowing that we're walking on the brittle threads of life, of this mortal life, not knowing what time that we're going to be summoned to answer on High. Let us, O Lord, lay aside everything in our heart, everything in our mind, and look straight to Your Word, tonight, and for You to come and interpret It with living oracles. Grant it. May Your Spirit fall upon us and anoint the Word to our heart, that we might go from here, this evening, better people than we are now, that we might have a closer insight on Jesus Christ. Grant it, Lord, that we might understand the day that we're living in, and the preparation of God for His people in this hour; this great, crucial, dark time that we're now living in. God, anoint it, not only speaker, but hearer. And, together, make our hearts to tremble at Your Word. \"For the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.\" Grant these things, Father, for we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. [Psalms 111:10], [Proverbs 9:10] 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min\n\nL-22 I'd like to title these few remarks that I was going to make here, and some Scriptures that I would like to follow up closely behind, if the Lord willing, to the--the thanksgiving Message, to the invisible, of: The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ. The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ. Doesn't sound like a thanksgiving Message. Though, any Scripture, we're thankful for all of It.\n\nL-23 I am thankful to God, to be living in this time, of the closing scenes of this world's history. I don't know. If I would have had a say-so before the foundation of the world, and the God would have laid out the whole program to me, and said to me, \"I--I want you to preach. And now what age do you desire, to go to the earth to preach?\" I would have chose this age, for I think this is the golden age.\n\nL-24 I certainly would have loved to have been here during the time of His visit to the earth. But, still, I think this right now is a greater time, because it's a time that He's coming to take the people that He's redeemed, nearing the resurrection when all the redeemed will come forth. What a glorious opportunity we have, to speak to a dying people, great time! We are enthused about it. [I Thessalonians 4:16-17]\n\nL-25 And we know that history is closing out. The world's history will soon be over, then we're going to step into a new day, to the great Millennium. That, as one believer, I believe in the... in a Millennium, a Millennium reign with Christ, a thousand years upon the earth; the physical return of the Lord Jesus, to take a physical people, glorified, by His cleansing Blood. [Revelation 20:6]\n\nL-26 Paul here is giving an illustration, in our Scripture, about the law and grace, and illustrating it like marriage and divorce. This passage is very seldom preached on, because it's, more or less, pertains to, like, marriage and divorce. But it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce, of how that he's trying to set in order here that we, as a--as a Church, can no more be married to the world and to Christ, at the same time, and--and be legal and lawful about it, than it can be for a woman to be living with a husband while she's got a living husband. And I have my own thoughts of that, and I believe that what the Bible says is the Truth. [Romans 7:1-5]\n\nL-27 Now, but I believe, also, is to my belief, that it unfolds one of the great mysteries of prophecy. And I hope that the Lord will help us, tonight, as we deliver this to our waiting people across the country.\n\nL-28 It was said, one time. I was reading, when I was writing the note for this, I--I could not exactly remember the book that it's in. But I--I'm sure this is right, that, one of the books I read on Mr. Moody, Dwight Moody, in Chicago. We have a great listening church in Chicago, also, tonight. That, Mr. Moody, after reading Romans 7, ran into the street, and the first man he met, he said to him, \"Do you know grace?\" And the man replied, \"Grace who?\" Mr. Moody said, \"The grace of God.\"\n\nL-29 So, it so thrilled him when he seen what, how grace had separated us from the law, and how, that what part grace played. Well, now, anything that I want to do, is when... I always told the people, when I cross the line, on the other Side, I'd like to stand up and sing. Amazing grace! How sweet the sound, That saved a wretch like me! Grace, precious grace! More of grace to know!\n\nL-30 \"For it's by grace we are saved; not by what we can do.\" What we can, whatever we do, is not counted to us. Grace is what saves us. \"By grace are you saved, through faith.\" [Ephesians 2:8]\n\nL-31 May I add to this Woman, Grace. May I place Her in the Bible, also, is called the elect Lady, this Miss Grace I'm going to talk about. Know, the Bible declares, said, \"To the elect Lady.\" That, if you notice, \"elect\" come from the word \"elected Lady.\" One Lady, amongst all the other ladies, was elected. [II John 1:1] Like, the virgin was to bring forth the body of God, on the earth. She was an elected woman. God chose Mary. And, also, God has chose an elected Lady, which is His Bride. She's elected. I hope we're members of that, tonight, across the world, across the nation, rather. [II John 1:1] 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min\n\nL-32 The illustration here, showing the relationship of Bride to Christ, the elect Lady: and how She was to be brought to Him; where She would come from; and how that She would be brought to Him. The Church here, in illustration that we got in view, is illustrated by a woman. Which, a woman is always a type of the Church, because the Church is considered a Bride. A Bride, She is the Bride of the Lord Jesus, the Son of God. [I Peter 1:2]\n\nL-33 Always, if you'll watch, watch the conditions and the conduct of women, and you'll see where the church is.\n\nL-34 Now, this, some of these remarks may seem strange to some of you, but it's complimentary to the Message that I have from the Lord, that I'm trying to get to the peoples. The... You watch everything in the natural, how it's happening, nature, and watch it. It runs sure with the spiritual, also.\n\nL-35 Now, if you'll see the conduct of women in the world today, watch the conduct of the worldly church today. Just watch. Of course, now, there is also the conduct of the spiritual Bride, the Church. See? Watch That, also. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Because, the natural so call, claim to be Bride.\n\nL-36 Now, please let me say again to the local assembly. Don't feel bad now. I'm--I'm speaking to all out across the country, to the, what I think, the elect Lady. So if there happen to be ministers in here, that doesn't agree, well, just hold your peace for a little while. See? Notice. Just listen.\n\nL-37 Notice this character. When you see women just go on the rampage, just doing anything they want to do, watch, the church is doing the same thing. Notice. But watch when, the spiritual Bride, when She begins to have a revival, when She begins to come back and line Herself up with the Word of God. Watch then again, you see, how that the Scriptures, at that time, There'll be a Message sweep out to catch that Bride, catch that Woman, Elect. For, as the world, Satan, the deceiver who deceived the first bride, to sinning against the God, by misbelieving His Word. [Genesis 3:2-4]\n\nL-38 And now, today, as we see the church natural, in your intellectual gospel, going further and further away from the Word, in social gospel; we find that the women of the world, on the streets, members of such, is carrying themselves in the same atmosphere. You can't tell them. They've lost all sense of common decency, the people have. See? And that's the way the church has. And you can see it going straight to the ecumenical council, just as certain as anything in the world, and right into Rome as hard as it can go, see, 'cause it's prophesied. And there she is. That's her behavior. [II Timothy 3:1-6]\n\nL-39 But then watch again to the spiritual Church, how that group of people, called out, the Elected, through every revival. In Martin Luther, it happened the same way in the reformation. It happened the same thing in the time of John Wesley. It happened the same thing when Pentecostal first started. They dropped them women right back in line with the Word, and then they drift away. There she goes right back over into chaos. But then the time that the people are ready to line up, there is a Message comes forth, and they line with It. , [Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26], [Revelation 3:5, 12, 21]\n\nL-40 Luther was the messenger of one day, of justification, and the Church lined right with it, some of them. The rest of them continued on. Wesley come with sanctification, the Church lined right with it. Pentecost come with the restoration of the gifts, the Church lined right with it, the Elect of that day; and then faded away, went right back off in denominationalism and went right out with the rest of them, all of them right down along the line. [Revelation 3:1, 7, 14]\n\nL-41 Now, but you notice, when the people begin to try to line with the Word, there comes a fresh Message from the Word of God, right straight to the people. And they catch that Message and line up, every time. It's just in God's... We have that.\n\nL-42 We have families. Every family in here is custom to that. Sometimes everything will run fine for you, for years. Then, all at once, you'll hit a spell where, we say it many times in the South here, \"When it rains, it pours,\" and everything goes wrong. You're going through a night time. Then there's a day break, then a night time. Everything runs in continuity.\n\nL-43 The prophet, Paul, here is saying that a woman cannot remarry until her first husband is dead. She cannot remarry 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min as long as her first husband is living; she, by no circumstances, at all. She must remain single as along as her first husband is living. And if she should do such a sin, \"she shall be called an adulteress.\" I'm speaking of the natural now, to type it with the spiritual. If this woman would commit such a sin, then she is marked, \"an adulteress,\" if she has two living husbands at the same time. Therefore, she has forfeited, by doing this, her rights to God and Heaven, by doing so. She sure has. She is an outcast from the economy of God, according to the Scriptures that I've just read. [Romans 7:2-3]\n\nL-44 So is the church, when she tries to mix creed and denomination with the Word of God. She can't be married to a denomination, and be the Bride of Christ, at the same time. She's got to be dead to one or the other. The law says so, here. There's plenty of laws in God's Word. And that's His law, Paul speaking the same thing here. She cannot be married to a church of worldly creed, and be the Bride of Christ, because (she) one is contrary to the other. Now, remember. Say, \"Well, we believe this, but we don't believe That.\" [Romans 7:4]\n\nL-45 If you're married to Christ, Christ is the Word of God. In Saint John, the 1st chapter, said, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the same was made flesh and dwelt among us.\" Christ was the living Word. He always was the Word. He is still the Word. He always will be the Word. He was only the manifestation of the attributes of God, for He was the Son of God. [John 1:1]\n\nL-46 And any son is the attributes of his father, and just as you were in the genes of your father, in the body of your father when he was a young boy. You were in him. Yet, he could not have fellowship with you, because he didn't know you. But then, through the bedding grounds of a mother, you were brought forth into the earth and become in the image of your father, then he could fellowship with you. [I John 3:9]\n\nL-47 And so were you, sons of God and daughters of God, before there even was a moon, stars, or a molecule. You were sons and daughters of God, for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning. For, there's only one form of Eternal Life, and that was you, before. You don't know nothing about it. Neither did you know when you was in your earthly father, but you are manifested, too, in his image. In the image of God you are made, and you were manifested for the glory and the fellowship of God. [Ephesians 1:4]\n\nL-48 And, therefore, as sure as your gene had to be in your father, before your natural birth, your spiritual gene had to be in God, because you're an expression of the attributes of His thoughts, before the foundation of the world. Right. No way around it. That's right. Now, now we notice, then, that Life being in you, God's Life being in you, from the foundation of the world. [Ephesians 1:4]\n\nL-49 Now, now, you cannot mix denomination creed with the Word, because they're too contrary, one to the other. That's exactly what Satan tried to do with his intellectual conception to Eve. He said he admitted that God said it, but he said, \"Surely, you'll not die.\" See? And they believe that. [Genesis 3:4] And that's what creed has done, tonight. Denomination has separated the people from the Word of God. Didn't Jesus say, when He come, \"You, through your tradition, have made the Commandments of God of no effect to the people\"? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] And through our creed, we have disassociated the fellowship of the Holy Spirit to anoint the Word of God that's laced out for this generation. We have separated the people so, by denomination, that they cannot have a chance to see It. [Matthew 15:6]\n\nL-50 Now, God, He, every generation, He adds a new part of His Book. It all goes together. Like my body was built. I'm told it started in the spine, but wasn't all spine. It went from that to ribs, and from lungs, and to hands, and arms, and feet, and so forth, and it come on out to be the person that I am. And so was God manifested in the beginning. And finally He was appeared as Jehovah, God the Father. Then He appeared as God the Son, in Jesus Christ. Now He's appeared as God the Holy Ghost. The same God, all the time, three manifestations of the same--same God. [Hebrews 9:26] Now, we find in this, that, each generation, God has lotted His Word from the beginning.\n\nL-51 Just like evolution came. Just like first thing God created, probably, was... Let's say He created botany life, first. Then He created animal life, next. Then He created human life, next. Kind of an evolution, rising higher. [Genesis 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min 1:11-12, 20-21, 25-27]\n\nL-52 So has it been in God and His Church. Justification under Luther. Sanct-... That's pulling His Bride out, now. He's creating His Bride. Justification under Luther; sanctification under Wesley; and so forth, you see. He, the evolution of the Spirit being given more and more, 'cause the Body is building, coming to the Head, which is Christ, the Body of Christ. [Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26], [Revelation 3:3, 12, 21]\n\nL-53 Now, She, as a woman, if She is married to Christ the Word, She cannot be married to a church denomination at the same time, for She's bound by it. She shall... cannot live with both husbands at the same time. They're contrary, one to the other. One is God-sent, the other one is man-made, so they're contrary. Said, \"Let every man's word be a lie; Mine be the Truth.\" God said that. [Romans 3:4], [Romans 7:3]\n\nL-54 Just as much contrary to one another, as law was to grace, as Paul speaking of here. One must be dead, to have the other. \"And if she tries to mix them, she shall be called an adulteress.\" Oh! Think of it. New York, Arizona, across the nation, think of it. God said, \"If she's tried to be married to two at the same time, she shall be called an adulteress.\" What adulteress can enter Heaven? Would God marry an adulteress? Certainly not. He asked us not to do it. \"She shall be called an adulteress.\" [Romans 7:3]\n\nL-55 Then, her children, if she is an adulteress, her children is illegitimate. Illegitimate! Illegitimate to what? Not to the church, but to the Word. She is illegitimate. What a picture of this Revelations 3 here, of the last-day, Laodicea church age! What an illegitimate group! What a denominational mix up! Lukewarm, carry on and call themselves Christians, and deny the Word of God, \"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof,\" as the prophet said they would be. [II Timothy 3:5], [Romans 7:3]\n\nL-56 Marriage is the oldest institution in the world. Marriage was performed first, and instituted, in the garden of Eden. [Genesis 2:23-25]\n\nL-57 A woman is entrusted with certain characters that she must not defile. A woman is trusted to that. There's not a creature on earth like a woman. There's no female dog, there's no female of any kind, entrusted with the character that a woman is. [I Timothy 2:9-15]\n\nL-58 A woman was not even in the--the beginning of the creation, because God knowed that she would fall. All other females could not commit adultery. She is the only one that can commit adultery. If she had been made like the original, that would been discomplimentary to God's great wisdom. See? She was made a by-product of a man. [Genesis 2:21-22]\n\nL-59 But because she was cast over in that side, she has also been given a sacred charge from God, for redemption. She's got characters that she must not defile. [I Timothy 2:9-15] If she would mar them, she is defiled for lifetime. No matter how much she is forgiven, she can't be justified. I'll strike that in a little bit. Got a Scripture on that, in a few minutes. She can be forgiven for her defilement, but she cannot be justified in this life. It's always with her. Notice now. She's been given this. She may be forgiven, but not justified. [I Timothy 2:9-15] Her body is given to her, a sacred trust from God. No female dog, no bird, no other animal, no other creature like that. No. She is the only one. By it, she is... The reason it's so sacred, she is to bring forth life into the earth. Her body is the bedding grounds of life, therefore that's the reason she is give this sacred trust. [I Timothy 2:9-15] Now here is where you may disagree, many, you theologians. That's what defiled the whole human race, is that adultery at the beginning. Her bedding ground was marred. She brought forth those twins, Cain and Abel. One act, two children. Search the Scriptures. Uh-huh. [Genesis 4:1-2]\n\nL-60 Notice now. We find that her body is the bedding grounds, and therefore it's a sacred trust, not to defile that. Now, I'm speaking now, bringing this to an illustration, to show you where the Church stands. I'm not speaking of you women. Whatever you are, that's between you and God, or you men. But I'm speaking of the Church and Christ. [Romans 7:4]\n\nL-61 Now, this she is given, to bring forth life that only God Himself can give. Her husband might be the germ bearer, but God has to produce the life. That's right. It has to come. All life has to come from God. Any life has to come from 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min God. It's perverted, and that's what makes it sinful, but life has to come from God. He's the author of life. Now she has a sac-... one... [Psalms 36:9], [John 1:4], [Acts 17:24-25]\n\nL-62 I want to name three things here that she must not get away from. Now, I'm speaking, keep the church in mind while I'm speaking this to the natural woman, as Paul is here, in 7th chapter of Romans. [Romans 7:1-6]\n\nL-63 She has a sacred trust of virtue committed to her by her Lord, a certain virtue. Nothing else holds it but a woman. Right. That's committed to her by God. She must not defile that virtue. [Romans 7:3]\n\nL-64 If she even does something wrong, she must confess that to her husband before he takes her, and make it right. The same as the church that was married to the law, has to come also before Christ, before the second marriage. She has to confess that. If she doesn't, and she lives with her husband for ten years and then confess it, he has a right to put her away and marry another woman. That's the Scripture. Fornication is unclean living. [Leviticus 5:5], [Proverbs 28:13], [James 5:16], [I Thessalonians 4:3-4], [I Corinthians 7:2], [Matthew 19:9]\n\nL-65 \"Joseph, fear not, take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.\" He was minded to put her away privately, see, after he'd already engaged to her. When you're engaged to her, as far as God is concerned, you're married to her. [Matthew 1:20]\n\nL-66 Notice now. She has a sacred trust of virtue that's been given her, trusted to her by the Lord. God gave her that virtue. Just as it was in the garden of Eden, she can say \"yes\" or \"no.\" She has a sacred trust of womanhood committed to her, that she must not break. The womanhood I'm speaking of here is her conduct, her character around men. Not letting every man... [Matthew 19:9]\n\nL-67 Looks on these screens and see these movie stars kissing, and hugging, and slopping, and around, over these women. A woman does that, is of a bad character. She might be virtuous, otherwise. But, see, in her heart... When, those glands, sex glands, are in the lips. The man kisses a woman, he's actually, potentially, committed adultery. Sex glands are in the woman's lips and in the man's lips. He could kiss her on the hand, it wouldn't mix through their sex glands. But the sex glands is in the lips. And see all this nonsense in the--the Hollywood today, of all this slopping and loving around with women, and so forth, and little girls looking at all that. No wonder our morals are rotten and decayed, and filthy, see, because it's put before the children. That's right. It has to be that way for the last day. [Matthew 5:27-28, 32], [Mark 10:11-12, 19], [Luke 16:18], [I Timothy 2:9-15]\n\nL-68 Now keep the church in mind. She is kissing and slopping, and mixing around in everything else but the Word, let the Devil, and education and scientific searches, and so forth.\n\nL-69 When, scientific, education, everything, is absolutely contrary to God. The whole system of civilization that we have now is absolutely antichrist. Educational system is antichrist. Civilization is antichrist. It's against God. You say, \"Against civilization?\" God will have a civilization, one of these days, that won't have any death associated into it. This modern civilization come by Satan. I'll prove that to you, if the Lord willing, tonight, out of the Bible. All these things are of Satan. Our new civilization will have none of this in it. She has this sacred womanhood. [Matthew 4:8-9]\n\nL-70 No wonder that men act around women the way they do, is because women act around men the way they do. She characters herself out here with a pair of shorts on, and skin-tight, and men's clothing and things, out on the street, twisting around. No matter what she says, she might be as virtuous to her husband as she can be, but, in the sight of God, \"She is an adulteress.\" \"Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.\" And she presented herself to be that.And that's exactly what the church has done with the world. [Matthew 5:28], [I Timothy 2:9-15]\n\nL-71 Notice. That's committed to her: sacred virtue, sacred womanhood, and then sacred motherhood, honor her husband. [I Timothy 2:9-15]\n\nL-72 Just look today. In certain cities, many cities, they even have big parties in what call society, church members, too. Set their hats in the floor, and they all get drunk and pitch their keys into it. Each woman goes and picks a key out of the hat, for the man she'll live with over the weekend. All kinds of such parties! Which, I've got so much to say here, if 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min the Lord willing, I haven't got time to go into it. Such a filth!\n\nL-73 And the church is just as bad, right, committing adultery with everything, and she has no business to be going into. She should stay with the Word. [Romans 7:4]\n\nL-74 Buildings are all right. Hospitals are all right. All these other things are all right. Educational programs, that's all right. We have to live here, have to read, write. That's one of the economies.\n\nL-75 Like, we wasn't supposed to put on any clothes, at the beginning. I'll preach on that, later this week, the Lord willing. But we have to wear clothes because God gave us clothes. But, in the beginning, we didn't need them. We were veiled. [Genesis 2:25], [Genesis 3:7, 10, 11]\n\nL-76 Now she is veiled to her sin. She don't even know she is sinning, see, as she was then. By the... Now she is veiled by the Devil; then she was veiled by God. The difference of it. [I Timothy 5:6]\n\nL-77 Now we find out that she has been given this sacred trust that she must not break: of womanhood, act, have her character, raise her children, be honorable to her husband. [I Timothy 2:9-15]\n\nL-78 Now days, they pay a bit more attention to it than nothing in the world. You ought to set in my office some time and see men bring in their wives, where they try to get right with God and confess of all the men they lived with, and everything else, since they been married. Oh, you say, \"That's...\" No. That's Pentecostals. Uh-huh. The others won't come. So it's...\n\nL-79 I'm speaking of how it can get away, when you get to mixing up with the world, the church, and all the fashions and things that we have. We're no more like the original pentecost was than day is from night. We've drifted off somewhere, into some dark chaos somewhere, and lost. [I John 2:15-17], [Romans 12:2]\n\nL-80 What a sacred trust! What a responsibility to a woman! Now see why she's a type of the Church, which has the same responsibility. As a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood, to her virtues, to her husband, the Church has a sacred responsibility to prayer and to the Word, and to Christ, just the same as the woman has. [I Timothy 2:9-15]\n\nL-81 And as a woman drifts off with another man; when the church goes off on these institutional programs, and building programs and schools, and so forth. I have nothing against them. They're all right. They serve their purpose. But they're not...\n\nL-82 Jesus never said, \"Go, make schools.\" He said, \"Preach the Word.\" [Mark 16:15], [Luke 9:60], [II Timothy 4:2-3]\n\nL-83 That's where they neglect It. Not make institutions, hospitals, and so forth. Them is all right, but that's not the Church's duty. Their duty is to preach the Gospel, but we've done everything else but that. And we've drifted in, just like Satan did, and mix it up with some Gospel, something else, and something else, till it's got a conglomeration of nothing. Corruption, even our whole, the whole world! Watch the trend of the world. [II Timothy 3:1-5]\n\nL-84 Reading Reader's Digest, here not long ago, where young girls are going through their menopause, and men, the change of life, between twenty and twenty-five years old. They're going through their middle age. Corruption, (why?) because of scientific research of food and stuff that's broke down, from the natural things we should put in our body. We are nothing but a bunch of dying corruption.\n\nL-85 Now, that's what the church is, also. It's in the same condition. [II Timothy 3:1-5]\n\nL-86 She's a type. She has the same precious virtues by Spirit, given to Her, to preserve the Spirit and the Word, and never commit adultery with anything of the world or anything. Stay virgin to the Word, as a woman is to stay virtuous to her husband. It's a sacred trust, to honor Her Lord's Word above every man-made creed, wisdom, denomination there is. The Church is given that trust. [I Timothy 2:9-15]\n\nL-87 If they say, \"Well, my church...\" I don't care what your church believes. If it's contrary to the Word of God, stay away from it.\n\nL-88 The Bible said, \"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, forever.\" Mark 16 said, \"These signs shall follow them 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min that believe.\" If a church preaches different from That, don't you. You die to that thing. Be born again, into the Word of God. \"Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.\" That's how far It was to go. \"These signs shall follow them that believe, in all the world, and every creature that will believe.\" See how we got away from It? Sure. But She is responsible for It. [Hebrews 13:8], [Mark 16:15, 17]\n\nL-89 But now look what, Hollywood, has took the virtuous things from our women. I'm setting here looking at dear old woman, Sister Schrader, many of the women here, and back, and Sister Moore over here, the older women that remembers a few years ago. If their mother, or even them, would have walked out on the streets, the way some of these women walk today, church members, they'd have locked the woman up for being insane. \"She forgot to put on her skirt.\" Well, if it was insane then, it's insane now.\n\nL-90 Well, look, the whole world proves it's insane. Look at the murders and things that's going on now in the world. See? Insanity! The whole thing is coming to fulfill Revelation. We may get to it, this week. Where, those hideous things, them is not natural. That's spiritual things, that make people scream for the rocks and the mountains, and everything else, to fall on them. [Revelation 6:15-17] The complete, total insanity this world will go into, right away, it's almost there now. Why, you see the footsteps of it. There it is. It--it's marching right out on the street, right down the church pew, total insanity, do things that a human being wouldn't think of doing and being civilized.\n\nL-91 Look what Hollywood has done to the woman. Look how it is. It's robbed the sacred virtues of the woman. On and on, we could go. See? All this she lost. How did she do it? Because there was a subtle instrument called the church, like there was in the garden of Eden. A subtle person, the Devil, walked into the church just like he did in the garden of Eden, and deceived her into it. She is deceived. The woman thinks; she don't mean to be wrong. [Genesis 3:1-6], [I Timothy 2:14]\n\nL-92 Eve didn't mean to do wrong. It wasn't willfully. But she... The Bible said, in Second Timothy, First Timothy 3, \"She was deceived.\" And deceived is not when you willfully do it. It's when you're deceived into doing it. [II Timothy 3:1-9]\n\nL-93 And that's just exactly what's happened today. She's been deceived, by television, by magazine, by these people, these, all these fine things that they're going, out on the street. Modern girls, they look at magazines and they look at pictures. They look on the street. They see the clothing in the shops. How Satan, that great instrument of--of hell, has come down amongst the people and deceived them into these things! And the woman thinks she is all right. And she is dead and don't know it. She is far from God. See how she lost all this, and how subtle it was? [II Timothy 3:1-9]\n\nL-94 Today, I want you to notice. Jesus spoke of it. Also, if you'd like to read it, Jesus made mention that this thing would come to pass. Did you know that? In His last hours, just before His crucifixion. Let's just read it, Saint Luke, the--the 23rd chapter, and just for a moment, like a Sunday school lesson. Begin with the 27th verse, I believe I got marked out here. Jesus going to Calvary. Listen as I read it. All right. Saint Luke 23:27, I believe, is where we have it. My note has got it that way. Yeah. Here it is. And there followed him a great company of people, and... women, which also bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. For, behold, the day--days are coming,... that they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the womb that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. [Luke 23:27-31]\n\nL-95 Think, today, a disgrace for her to have a child. See? Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and hi-... and the hills, Cover us. For if they do these things in a green--green tree, what shall they do in a dry? [Luke 23:27-31]\n\nL-96 Speaking of the day that when women wouldn't no more want children. They want a dog or a cat, or something 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min like that, but she don't want children anymore. Why? \"She is old Mother Hubbard if she has a child.\" See? She don't want. That's the--that's the remarks of Hollywood. It don't want his woman to be an old Mother Hubbard. So she'll, he'll have some operation performed to himself or her, one, that'll keep them from having children. They don't want no children.\n\nL-97 Jesus spoke of it. And what did He say? \"At that time they'll begin to cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on them.\" [Revelation 6:16]\n\nL-98 She'll practice birth control, so she can go to parties. She can't be bothered with a baby nursing her. \"It'll disform her. When she's pregnated, it'll be, it disform her. She won't look like she used to.\" And her husband, ignorant enough to let her go that way. She won't give him a child. [Luke 23:29]\n\nL-99 Jesus spoke of it. And He said, that, \"When they were doing this, at that time they'll go to crying then for the rocks to fall on them.\" It's Coming of the Lord. [Luke 23:29-30]\n\nL-100 They pay great sums of money for cats, dogs, to mother. That's right. She must mother something, because it's a God-given nature to her.\n\nL-101 I notice. I hunt big game. An old bear in the fall of the year, when she has been bred to the male bear, she's got cubs then that's born. They're pretty good-size cubs, maybe weigh a hundred pounds or better. She'll make them scat and hibernate to themselves, because she's going to bring forth some more cub. They're born in February. The bear knows nothing about it.\n\nL-102 They're born in little sacks. How that God has them open these little sacks, themself, little... like little cellophane sack. They find their way around. Their mother is sound asleep. She hasn't eat anything since October, and this is February. They come around and nurse her till the middle of May.\n\nL-103 Then when she sees her cubs, they're pretty good-size cubs, weigh maybe fifteen, ten or fifteen pounds apiece. They nursed her. How she gets the milk, that's God's idea. She lives, herself, and produces milk for the cubs. And then if her breeding doesn't take, and she don't have any cubs, she'll hunt up them year, last-year cubs, and mother them all summer long, because it's God-given instinct. She has to mother something. And if a woman won't have a baby for her husband, she'll take a dog or a cat, or something. She's got to mother something. It's a nature. But to bear a child for her husband, and raise it to the service of God, that's entirely all out of her line. She should. Oh, she'd... Oh, she'd be so disgraced, if she did, by her sin-loving society of this 1965 type of women. [Luke 23:29], [I Timothy 5:6]\n\nL-104 A true picture of the modern church today! Neither does the modern church want any of these here, screaming, shouting, tongues-speaking, Acts 2:38 young'ns around her. Yeah. Yeah. See? Yeah. She don't want any of them whooping, and crying, and screaming, \"Amen! Hallelujah!\" Why, such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination. They had one like that in one of the churches, why, they'd throw her out right quick. \"Why you letting such stuff as this go along?\" [Acts 2:38], [Luke 23:29]\n\nL-105 So, you see, she's pregnated with something, 'cause she's bringing forth members all the time. But she don't want none of them screaming, hollering, blabbering, Acts 2:38, miserable creatures that she thinks they are. It would certainly embarrass her. It would ruin her and her educated, ethical, scientific society church that she belonged to here. They would throw her out, at the next council. She can't have it. So she don't want to be pregnated with the Word, because that's the only kind that the Word can bring forth. [Acts 2:38], [Luke 23:29]\n\nL-106 Born of the Spirit of God, it has the Spirit of God in it. No intellectual church-join and creed-going, bobbed hair, painted face; there's no such a thing as that in all of It. You don't find that in the Word of God. You find an old-fashion, sanctified, Holy Ghost-filled child, born of the Spirit of God, screaming, hollering, shouting, praising God. [John 3:16], [Acts 2:38], [I John 3:9], [I John 4:7], [I John 5:1, 4, 18]\n\nL-107 That's altogether out of the reaches for her. She don't want That. Oh, no, sir! No, indeedy. What does she do then? So she brings forth a pair, a painted-face, short-wearing, Jezebel society, illegitimate \"cats,\" they call them, I think it is. See? I think they call it cats. See? \"Look at that cat going there,\" they say, or something like that, you know. [I Timothy 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min 2:9-15]\n\nL-108 She was born, or married, connected with her first husband, the first Adam, by the adulterous wife of Eve, Adam's first wife. You say, \"Adulterous?\" She sure was. But, oh, she claims that this Adam, this first Adam, is dead. \"Oh, sure, he died a long time ago. I'm reborn, again,\" she said, \"and I'm certainly married to the Second Adam, Christ, the Word.\" [I Timothy 2:9-15]\n\nL-109 How? Notice what she loves. Watch her lover, you want to see who she is in love with. The Word says This, but she said, \"My church says this.\" Then who she in love with? Who is her husband? Her own fruits prove what she is. Exactly right, shows what she is. Notice. She was born, first, to Adam, 'cause that's her natural birth. See? And she never left that. That's a lover of the world. She claims that she is born the second time, to Christ. But her lover, notice, is Adam, yet, because she loves the world.\n\nL-110 And another--another thing, notice what kind of children she is bearing. That tells what their papa is, whether it's the first Adam or Second Adam. If the Church brings forth a child of the Second Adam, he acts the Second Adam's way of acting, like they did on Day of Pentecost. That's the really true Second Adam's children. See? Right. Their nature is like his and hers. Yes, sir. Her daughters, painted-face, bobbed-haired, wearing men's clothes, trousers. The Bible said for her \"not to do it.\" She cuts her hair. \"It's a shame to her.\" You say, \"Shut up, on that.\" [I Timothy 2:9-15] That's what the Word says. I'm only pointing out nature. That's what she does.\n\nL-111 Her sons, her sons born out of her, rely upon education, schooling, some Bible school, so-called, some great college that's supposed to be a long time ago, hatching them out, in some sort of an incubator style. Denominational-seekers, religious Cain-like, just illegitimate to the Word as Cain was; right, just as ill, illegitimate as Cain was, sure, denominational-seekers. You see what it is? [II Timothy 3:1-5] God never did organize a denomination. He's always been against it. His Word is against it.\n\nL-112 But they hold right onto it, so you see what they're bringing forth. That shows who their papa and mama is. Exactly. Exactly. Just as illegitimate as Cain was. That's kind of a child he brought forth from Eve. They got away from the Word, then see what she brought. That's just exactly what the church has brought, the same thing. [Jude 1:10-11]\n\nL-113 Can prove it to you, by the Word, that that's where education and civilization come, through Cain. That's exactly right. For they claim... But they--they claim to be sons of God, but they're denominational-bred, denominational school-scholared, everything else. That's exactly right. Subtle, smart! My! So was the serpent, their father. Right. Just as subtle and scientific preachers as Cain was. See? It's exactly the same thing. You say, \"Brother Branham, is that true?\" [Genesis 4:16-17]\n\nL-114 Turn to Genesis 4:16 and find out. Get back here in Genesis 4:16, just a minute, you'll find out how it happened. And Cain went... from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after... his son, Enos. [Genesis 4:16-17]\n\nL-115 On down to Tubal, on down, for they begin, come designers of instruments, music, and so forth. Civilization came by Cain, right, building cities, instruments. Scientific men come by Cain, the serpent's seed. Now notice the 25th verse. And Adam knew his wife again; [Genesis 4:16-17, 25]\n\nL-116 Now, he knew her once and she had two children. Search the Scripture. She had Cain and Abel. One act, and two children. You say... [Genesis 4:16-17, 25]\n\nL-117 They told me, not long ago, it couldn't be, happen. We got a case in Hollywood. Hollywood? We got a case in Tucson right now, up in court. A woman gave birth to a colored child and a white child, at the same time. They say she 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min can't do it. She can have two fertile seeds, too. They got it right in court now. I know dogs will do it. Animals will do it. And she's got there, the white man said, \"I'll support my own child, but not him.\"\n\nL-118 And the woman made the confession. She lived with her husband that morning, and the colored man that afternoon. \"If it's in,\" the doctor says, \"in the space of twenty-four hours, it'll happen if there's another fertile seed there.\" And there she did it.\n\nL-119 And that's exactly what happened here. Cain that... Satan, that morning, in the serpent; and Adam, that afternoon. When she... And she had two children. Now, Adam knew his wife again (the second time); and she bare a son,... [Genesis 4:16-17, 25]\n\nL-120 Remember, there is nowhere in the Bible that said Cain was Adam's son. Said, \"He was of that evil one,\" not Adam, \"the Devil.\" ... knew his (the second time), and knew... and had a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed... (That wasn't the real Seed.)... appointed me another seed instead of Adam, whom Cain slew. So... And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: and then began men to call upon the name of the LORD. [Genesis 4:16-17, 25-26]\n\nL-121 Not out of Cain's, that generation genealogy, but out of Seth's genealogy. So, \"Cain is the evil one.\" There come the serpent. [Genesis 4:16-17, 25-26]\n\nL-122 Now notice. The Bible plainly says here, that, \"Her first husband must be dead,\" not just put away. He's got to be dead. [Romans 7:3-4]\n\nL-123 I just got through preaching on Marriage And Divorce, and you all know about that. I'm not speaking now, altogether, this congregation here, but out across the nation. All right. Now you see what happened there, in Marriage And Divorce. When it...?... The Seven Seals was opened, that brought out the real Truth of it. [Luke 16:18], [Matthew 5:31, 32], [Matthew 19:3-11], [Mark 10:2-12], [I Corinthians 7:10-15]\n\nL-124 So, to be married to the Second Adam, Christ, the Word, you must separate yourself by death, from your first denominational husband, 'cause there isn't a one of them that can take all the Word of God. Just show me where that one is at. \"Oh,\" you say, \"mine.\" The other fellow says his, too. Put them together, and you find out you're both wrong, soon as you denominate. Read Revelation 17. So, you see, you've got to be dead from that thing. [Romans 6:2-23], [Revelation 17:1-15]\n\nL-125 Now, I'm not speaking this local assembly. I'm speaking altogether across the nation. You must be dead to your first husband. If you're united to Christ and still married to a denomination, you're an adulteress. You are Laodicea. [Revelation 3:14-22]\n\nL-126 A Church across the nation, we're following Jesus Christ, the Word. To be in the Bride, you have to be remarried to the Word of God, which is Christ. \"In the beginning was the Word; the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelled among us.\" [John 1:1, 14]\n\nL-127 As long as you hold to man's tradition of denominations, you are called, in God's Word, \"a adulteress.\" As long as you're a denominational creed-seeker, belonging to a denominational church that denies the Word, you are \"an adulteress,\" what the Bible said. [II Timothy 3:1-5], [Romans 7:3]\n\nL-128 Jesus said, \"You cannot serve two gods at the same time. You either serve God or mammon.\" Mammon is \"the world.\" \"He that loves the world, or the things of the world, the love of God is not even in him.\" The Seed of God can't be in him the same time (the love of God) the love of the world is in there. When the Seed of God is operating through you, that's the Word of God. The love of the world can't be in there at the same time. Now where is the short hair, and the shorts, and the painted faces? Now where is it at? [Matthew 6:24], [I John 2:15] You can't be virtuous to Christ, the Word of God, and serve a man-made denomination at the same time. It's contrary to the Word. Paul said here. \"Whereabouts?\" Romans 7. [Matthew 6:24], [Luke 16:13], [Romans 7:3-4]\n\nL-129 Neither can you bear God's sons, of His Word, to this illegitimate denominational group. You cannot do it. In your incubator, you cannot bring forth a Word son of God. I'm speaking to the church. But still you claim to be very 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min religious. So was Cain, the prostitute Eve's son, very religious, built altars and offered sacrifice, and paid his tithes and done everything that any other religious man would do. But he failed to keep that Word. He failed to have the revelation. [I John 3:12], [Jude 1:11-12]\n\nL-130 And the revelation is the only thing, the revelation of the Word. What is the... What is a revelation? Jesus said, \"Upon this rock I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell can't prevail against It.\" Faith is a revelation; because Faith has been revealed to you. [Matthew 16:18] \"Abel, by Faith, offered by revelation (Faith), offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain.\" [Hebrews 11:4] Cain thought they eat apples. They still got that idea, but it wasn't. It was an adultery, serpent's seed. And there when the Seven Seals opened, it declared it and proved it. My book is just out on it. Think, we have a thousand here now. See? Notice. That's Scripturally, from Genesis to Revelations. [Genesis 3:15]\n\nL-131 At the end time, both trees are coming to the seed and proving themselves. Here we are, right today, Laodicea and the Bride, just as clear and pretty as it can be in the Scripture, and right before your faces. \"You can't serve God and mammon.\" You can't be a virtuous Bible-believing Christian and associate yourself in the denominational affair. You just can't do it at the same time. One has got to be dead, and let the other one live. [Matthew 6:24], [Luke 16:13], [Romans 7:3-4]\n\nL-132 Neither can you bear God's Word son. Neither can the church bring forth. They don't want one--one of them, a screaming children, shouting and speaking in tongues, and all them things. They, you can't do that in a denominational church. They won't have you. They don't bring them like that. They take them up and shake their hands and say, \"If you believe, you've got It. As long as you put your name on the book, that's all you have to do.\" See? It's--it's illegitimate children to the Word, still claim to be religion. [II Timothy 3:1-9]\n\nL-133 So pregnated with Satan's wisdom and knowledge, the church has become! They send their people away to school, to learn how to say \"amen\" just right. They learn them how to say all this, and be very intellectual. What is it? It's pregnation of the Devil. What did Satan pregnate Eve with? To disbelieve the Word, for intellectuals, intellects, and it ruined the whole creation. That's exactly what she's done in the Word today, the church. She's pregnated herself with Bible schools and colleges, and things like that, reading, writing, arithmetic, and they know no more about God than a Hottentot would know about an Egyptian night. They know all their creeds, their prayer books, everything else, but know nothing about God. [II Timothy 3:1-7]\n\nL-134 They know when the Word is vindicated, when God spoke back there and lotted out His Word to each generation as they come along. Here come Noah along, and he preached that generation.\n\nL-135 Now, what if Moses would have come along, said, \"Let's build an ark\"? He'd been all out of style. But he was a prophet. He had the revelation of God.\n\nL-136 God vindicated it to be the Truth. He brought the children about, Israel out, and showed the Pillar of Fire before them, and vindicated the prophet; and said just exactly what He would do, and He did it. They said, \"Let not God speak. Let Moses speak, lest we die.\" [Exodus 20:19] He said, \"I'll speak to them no more like that, but I'll raise them up prophets, and they'll speak.\" [Deuteronomy 18:18]\n\nL-137 There stood Isaiah standing there, said, \"A virgin shall conceive.\" A man like him in a day when... How is a virgin going to conceive? \"Unto us a Son is born: a child is born, a Son is given. His Name shall be called: Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God, the Everlasting Father. Upon the throne of His father, David, He'll reign. There'll be no end to His Kingdom.\" How is it going be? He didn't know. He just spoke what God said. It's beyond any imagination, intellectual. It's beyond any scientific research. It's the Word of God. [Isaiah 7:14], [Isaiah 9:6, 7]\n\nL-138 Now we school our seminary students in all kinds of Bible theology and things like that, man-made theology, got a bunch of church just exactly a Laodicea, like God said it would be. Oh, my! When I look at that, and makes me shiver. Pregnated with intellectual conception! You've got to be a high school graduate before you can even enter. You've got to have... got to stand before a psychiatrist before you can be ordained. 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min\n\nL-139 Would you imagine Peter, James, and John going before a psychiatrist? Remember that hundred and twenty up there, couldn't even sign their own name? Stand before a psychiatrist, see if they... if all of their... if their reflex was just right, and so forth? They had a reflex, but it wasn't the intellectual conception or scientific research. It was through the Power of God. When It struck them, they knowed nothing to do but act out what the Holy Ghost said do. They didn't pay any attention to any intellectual, what the church said, and what the priests said, what this said, that said. They moved by the Spirit; fearless men. [Acts 2:1-4]\n\nL-140 First John 2:15, He said, \"If you love the world, or the things of the world, the love of God is not even in you.\" See? So how can you be pregnated with the Word of God which condemns the world, condemns Hollywood, condemns all of its fashion, condemns all these parties and carrying on, and so-called that they have in the name of religion? It condemns it. How can the Word pregnate a person: how can a bobbed-haired woman, painted face, wearing shorts? [I John 2:15]\n\nL-141 How can a preacher, goes out here to a seminary, and looks at Acts 2:38 and sees that there's not a person in the Bible ever baptized in those titles, and then still say he's pregnated with the Word of God? Telling you a lie! He sold his birthright. He's committed adultery against the very Thing that he said. He is put away, in divorce. God is going to have a virtuous Church, just exactly, a Bride. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-142 Bible said, \"The Word is not in you.\" So what kind of a children are you bearing? Pregnated denominationals. There has been no death to separate you from your first lover. [John 8:37] \"What will the Joneses think if I go to crying and speaking in tongue? What will they think if I'm rebaptized?\" What a nonsense! Are you married to Joneses? Are you married to the church? Are you married to Christ, the Word?\n\nL-143 Now, that's why she is still bearing his children. What kind of children she have? Here is some of their names they call today: cats, beatles, monsters, rickies, rickettas. Cats, beatles, that's church members. Sure. They're all his sons, sons of Cain, which is the sons of the subtle beast, just as smooth as they can be.\n\nL-144 Now take a good look for a moment, with your own spiritual insight, at your soul. Just look around. I'm speaking 'cross the nation now. Look just a few minutes, you out there in the Branham Tabernacle, you in the tabernacles on the West Coast, and Arizona, and everywhere you're at. Look at yourself for a few minutes. You say, \"That Message you're preaching, Brother Branham, is wrong.\" Look at yourself a little bit. Let the Holy Spirit search your minds with the Word, you'll agree with the Message. Let Christ, the anointed Word, search out your own conscience. Let Him get into you, see if That's right or not. And that's just one or two things I mention, when there hundreds of them.\n\nL-145 Does the Bible agree with a woman bobbing her hair? [The congregation says, \"No.\"--Ed.] Does the Bible believe, agree with three, baptisms in the name of \"Father, Son, Holy Ghost\"? [\"No.\"] No such a thing. Does the Bible agree with woman wearing man's clothing? [\"No.\"] Well, just take them three there, when there's hundreds of more. Search it out in the Light of God's Word. [I Corinthians 11:5-6, 10-15], [Deuteronomy 22:5]\n\nL-146 You say, \"I'm a church member.\" So was Cain. So was Eve. The Bible predicts, in the last days, that the Laodicea will be the same. [Revelation 3:14-21]\n\nL-147 Let the Holy Spirit search your conscience, and you'll agree with Daniel 5:12. When the queen come in before Belteshazzar, and said she found out that there was a prophet, Daniel, was among them, and he was a dissolver of doubts. You let the Holy Spirit. He is the Prophet of the day. Let Him come into your heart right now and examine with the Word of God, and the doubts about the Message will be all dissolved. He dissolves all the doubts. You find out, it's exactly on the Word for this day. [Daniel 5:12]\n\nL-148 You cannot preach Luther's message today. It goes in It, but that's the feet. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Cannot preach Wesley. Cannot preach Pentecostal. We're plumb beyond that. They denominated and died. They're the stalk. The stalk come up with the blade, that's the first condition of the church. Now, that there don't look like the first grain that went in the ground, the wheat. The second come forth is a pollen. That still don't look like the grain. Looks more like it. It's coming more in the image of the real grain. But the blades don't sure look like the grain that went in the ground. It's a carrier of the life that was in 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min the grain. But what did it do? It denominated, just like all other nature fits in with it. It died.\n\nL-149 Then what? The life run right up into the tassel. It's got whole lots of little--little balls hanging on it, looks like little--little grains in it. Look like it's a real grain, but it isn't. Then it drops down into the shuck. And what does it bring forth? A shuck.\n\nL-150 Now, you take a grain of wheat, when the wheat is first coming forth. And Jesus said, \"A corn of wheat.\" And you take that wheat and open it up. You pulled off the stalk. You looked at it. You say, \"We got a grain of wheat.\" Be careful. It's just exactly like the grain, but there's not a bit of grain in it. It's the shuck.\n\nL-151 There's the Pentecostals, \"So much,\" as Matthew 24:24 said, \"deceive the very Elected in the last days, if it was possible.\" But you pull leaf by leaf back, you ain't got no grain. The grain is right back in the back of it. See? [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-152 And then the Life comes out of that denomination, goes into the grain. Then what happens? When the grain begins to grow, and to get bigger so It can cover over something, the denomination pulls away from It. Why ain't we got a denomination out of This? They never will be. It's the grain. It can't go no farther. We're at the end time. So what does It have to do now? Lay in the presence of the Son, to be ripened, that's exact, the Word to be ripened into your heart, to bring forth and live what we're talking about. Yes, sir. [I Peter 4:7]\n\nL-153 Then you'll have no more doubts, if you let the Holy Spirit reveal It to you, like the queen said about Daniel.\n\nL-154 You may say, \"What's this all got to do with thanksgiving? What you talking about, Brother Branham? Here it is, quarter to nine. You didn't say nothing about thanksgiving.\" What a Message for the occasion, to me! Yes, indeed.\n\nL-155 The pilgrim fathers were very thankful for their new-found way of life, being separated from the old English denominations and creed. They could marry to the new, anointed Word for their age; that's right, the new, anointed Word of their age, for their day. So can we be thankful, as pilgrims, like Abraham, separated ourself from the things of the world, all of our associates. Abraham was a pilgrim. God has separated us from all the dead religions. I'm speaking across the nation now, all the dead creeds. And to what? Separated us, and opened to us a new land, a new Message for this day. Pentecost dried up and died, like Luther, Wesley, and the rest of them. It's no more than a bunch of churches pulled together. Good people in there, yet, has got to be come out.\n\nL-156 What did He do? He opened up the Seven Seals of the last Message. You notice that? The Seven Seals, which, all the mysteries of the seven church ages was sealed with Seven Seals. The reformers didn't have time to do it in their days. They didn't live long enough. But this blessed revelation of the Seven Seals, it's open to us in this last days, from a prophecy that went forth to Arizona. [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-157 How I asked God, the other day, \"What are You doing with me out here in this desert?\" Did you know Moses wrote the New Testament... or the Old Testament? He certainly did. First four Books gives the laws, everything; Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. He wrote the Old Testament. To do that, he had to leave all of his associates and loved ones, and go into a desert.\n\nL-158 Paul wrote the New Testament. That's right. He wrote Romans, and Romans and all the rest of It there, Hebrews and Timothy, and so forth. And to do that, he had to separate from hisself, and go down into Arabia, into a desert, for three years, get the revelation of God. [Galatians 1:15-18]\n\nL-159 \"Oh,\" you say, \"how about Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John?\" They were scribes that just wrote what Jesus did. Paul separated, put the Word together. That's right. Well, then, look, if it taken that, and had to go to a desert, away from their loved ones.\n\nL-160 Remember what, What Time Is It, Sir? How many ever heard it? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Was it exactly right? [\"Amen.\"] Then we've got the revelation in this last days, for the Message of the Lord God to gather His Bride together. No other age has it been promised. It's promised in this age: Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, Saint John 14:12, Joel 2:38. Those promises is just exactly like John the Baptist identified himself in the 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min Scripture. [Malachi 4:5-6], [Luke 17:30], [John 14:12], [Joel 2:28]\n\nL-161 Jesus identified Himself. What'd they say? \"Away with such a person!\" \"John is a wild man.\" The church wasn't able to receive it. That's the pattern. Neither will the church receive it today.\n\nL-162 But, to the Elected, God is calling to the Elected. They know it: calling the virtuous Bride, the Word, the last-day Church, the elected Lady of our Lord Jesus Christ, Word. If... Jesus is the Word. How many believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] All right. Then, the Bride is always part of the Bridegroom, so the Bride will not be a denomination. It'll have to be the Word, manifested, to be the Bride of Christ. He promised to do it. He said how He did. Never uses... loses His pattern. He always did it by the pattern. He done it, every time, by the pattern. He does it again, calling out His virtuous Bride in the last day, the lovely Rebekah waiting for Her Isaac. What a beautiful time! [Ephesians 5:23]\n\nL-163 Here it brings into view, the two books that's going to be mysterious to you when you read the book of The Seven Church Ages. The two books: book of life, said, one says you can put your name on, you never comes off; other one says you take his name out of the Book of Life. This brings it perfectly in view, right here. I'm going to stop a few minutes, maybe, on a few notes here, and catch this before we close. [Revelation 3:5], [Revelation 13:8], [Revelation 20:12, 15]\n\nL-164 Life is a sacred thing, to God, and it's recorded in a book. God is the author of life. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] [Psalms 139:16], [Genesis 5:1]\n\nL-165 Our natural life here, we have, is just a perversion. It really should be the right life, to begin with, but it's perverted by the natural birth. The first life, or your first union, you were joined in at birth, by nature, a natural act. A natural human being associated, man and woman together, associated together in sexual affair, which brought your first life here, and that's associated with sin and death. How can you miss seeing the serpent's seed? [Romans 7:4-5]\n\nL-166 When you see the woman, a by-product; not another female like her; made in that order, knowing that she could be deceived. God knowed. If He didn't know the end from the beginning, then He wasn't God. If He isn't infinite, if He isn't... And He can't be infinite without being omniscient, omnipresent, knowing all things, Eternal. So He knowed all things, and He had to make that woman.\n\nL-167 The man didn't have a wife. The wife and the man was the same thing. He had the feminish and masculine spirit in himself. [Genesis 1:27], [Genesis 5:2] He had to separate, take a by-product, after the whole creation made. No female created by God, in the original creation, can do a thing like that. She was made thus, to do it. He knowed she would do it. If He didn't, He wasn't God. [Genesis 2:20-25]\n\nL-168 But, see, the attributes that's in God had to be displayed. He--He was to be a Saviour. And to make everything perfect, the way He had it, then there could be nothing lost. Oh, don't be children. Be men and women. We're at the end road. Notice. [II Peter 1:4]\n\nL-169 Now, it was nature, associated with death. Your first husband, that had rule over you, was your nature by natural birth. Natural, you love the world because you are the world, and part of the world. That right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Your desires was, by nature, to love the world which you're a part of. You're a part of nature. You believe that? [\"Amen.\"] And that's your natural thing. [Romans 7:3-4]\n\nL-170 That's the reason you have to be born again. You have to separate; you have to die to that first husband. You can't live with it. You just can't say, \"Well, I'll divorce him, and hang him up here till occasion.\" No, sir. No writing of divorcement! He dies. The nature of the world has to die. Every speck of him has to die. You have to be reunited, again, with another Nature. [John 3:16], [Acts 2:38] Your name of your first nature, was born, and put in a book of life. All your deeds was wrote in it, too. Everything you done under that nature was put in a book, called the book of life. [Psalms 139:16]\n\nL-171 You notice, in Daniel, when he come to \"the Ancient of Days, Whose hair was as white as wool. Ten thousand times ten thousands came with Him, to minister to Him; the--the Bride. And then the books were opened.\" \"And 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min another Book was opened, which was the Book of Life.\" See? There is saints already there, the Church, the Bride. \"Another Book was opened, which was the Book of Life.\" [Daniel 7:9-10]\n\nL-172 Now, you, but when you were separated from that union, by spiritual death. Your natural desire is to cut your hair. Your natural desire is to wear shorts, paint your face. Your natural desire is to be intellectual, smart man, know something better than the other. That's what Eve wanted. That's the very thing she wanted. [I Corinthians 11:5-6, 9-10, 13-16], [I Timothy 2:9-15]\n\nL-173 \"Well, say! You little two bit, two-by-four preacher, stand up there and tell me? I've got a Ph.D., LL.\" That just makes you farther away from God, every time you add one thing. See? See? That's right. It's true. See?\n\nL-174 That's what Eve took. She was pregnated with that kind of a pregnation. That's what the church is today, by Bible schools and intellectuals. And, look, every one disagreeing with the other, a big mess just exactly what the Bible said, \"Babylon.\" [Genesis 3:1-6]\n\nL-175 The Bride knows where She stands. She is very few. There won't be many saved; just a very, very, very few. You say, \"Well, there, said, 'thousands.'\" Yes. But they've come up through the two thousand years, too, on every age where It come out. Ever... [Matthew 22:14]\n\nL-176 Luther's age and that group; and then died off, and they went, denominated; then Wesley; and then come pentecostals, and so forth. All the little out branches of Baptists, Presbyterian, Methodists, Nazarenes, Pilgrim Holiness, and so forth, see, all those branched off from there like the leaf.\n\nL-177 But, remember, when it went down; and the grain begin to ripen. You find, before that grain can ripen, everything in that stalk has to be dead. Hallelujah! Can't you see where we're standing? Life is in the grain again. What is it? Just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground, the same Jesus in the Bride form, same power, same Church, same thing, same Word. The same Word sucked up through these and come out here, and come to a head here. And all that Life that come through here, picked up its people. Now it's forming up into a head, for the Rapture. Speaking on that tomorrow night, or next night, one, the Lord willing.\n\nL-178 Well, you separated from your first union, by spiritual death. Now you are born again, or remarried again, to the new spiritual union; of not your natural life of the things of the world, but of Eternal Life. That germ that was in you at the beginning, found you. [Romans 7:3-4]\n\nL-179 Now, your old book is gone, with your old union. Now, your name in your old, in your... has been transferred. Now, you say, \"Do you mean to tell me that my old book...\" God put it in the Sea of His Forgetfulness. You stand perfectly before God. [Romans 7:2-6], [Hebrews 8:12], [Hebrews 10:17]\n\nL-180 Now, your name is now in the new Book; not the book of life, but the Lamb's Book of Life, what the Lamb redeemed. Not the old book of your natural union, but your new, Bride. Hallelujah! Your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life, your marriage certificate, hallelujah, where your true Eternal germ, from the beginning, takes hold. Now you're not only forgiven, but you're justified. Glory! \"Justified,\" Romans 5:1 said. Yeah. Romans 5:1 said, \"Therefore being justified by faith.\" [Revelation 21:27], [Romans 5:1]\n\nL-181 Look up the word. The word don't mean forgiven. The word means justified. It don't mean you're forgiven. For instance, you heard I got drunk and--and done some evil things, and everything. Then you come around, say to me. You found out I didn't do them, then you come around, say, \"Brother Branham, I forgive you.\" Forgive me? I didn't do it, at the first place. See? Now, if I did do it, I'm guilty. But you could forgive me, and I wouldn't be guilty. But yet I'm not justified, because I actually done it.\n\nL-182 But the word, justified, is though you never done it. Amen. It's not even regarded, at all. How is it done? In God's Book of the Sea of Forgetfulness, your old book and marriage is divorced and dead. It's not even in the memories of God. Amen. You are justified. \"Therefore being justified.\" It was accused. You was accused. You never done it, in the first place. The old union is in the Sea of God's Forgetfulness. You wasn't married to it, to begin with. He, the Bridegroom, bore your shame, Himself, for you, in your place. He took your place, for you were predestinated for Him, 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min to be in His Bride, before the foundation of the world. The Bible said so. You are the predestinated Seed.\n\nL-183 How did you come to do this? You were deceived into it by your first marriage, to your adulterous parent, Eve. It's no fault of your own. By your natural birth, you come after Eve, who committed adultery. That's the reason you was born an adulteress. You're a sinner, to begin with. That's right. You was deceived into it. You had no... No, you, it ain't your fault.\n\nL-184 You never did it. Because, that little germ that was in you, was to be you, before the foundation of the world. God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life.\n\nL-185 Like my little eagle story, all of you has heard it. A hen... Old farmer set a--a hen, one time. So he didn't have enough hens out... eggs to go under the hen. So then he found an eagle egg, and they put it under him. When the eagle was born, it was the funniest-looking chicken them chickens ever seen, little old eagle going along. And the hen would go, \"Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck.\" Little eagle said, \"I don't know what that thing sounds like, but I'm following her, anyhow.\" And they went out in the barnyard and begin to scratch in manure piles. And she, \"Cluck, cluck, cluck. This is good. This is good. You join ours. And this is what...\"\n\nL-186 That little old eagle, he couldn't eat that stuff. See? He just--he just went along with the chicken because he didn't know. He didn't know what to do. And then she went out there, and she would get this or that. The little eagle just... he just had to stomach it, but he--he didn't know how to do it. But he had seen all the chickens doing it, but there's something different. He didn't like that.\n\nL-187 So, one day, the mother knowed that she had laid two eggs. So she begin to hunt for that other one, flying around, searching, like the great Holy Spirit. One day he flew over the barnyard, that denomination. She looked down there, and she seen her baby. She screamed. It was the Voice of something that echoed from the inside of him. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Oh, That sounds right! Oh! Let a real predestinated-born germ, predestinated by God, hear the Word of God, It's music to him. He knows It's the Truth.\n\nL-188 He's tired of that denominational stuff, anyhow, \"Join us. Come, go with us. We got a social party. We got this. We got...\" It just didn't sound right, to the little fellow. She said, \"Son, you don't belong in that group, anyhow. You belong to me. You're mine.\" He said, \"Mama, that sounds real. How am I going to get out?\" \"Just make a jump. I'll catch you.\" Uh-huh. That's all you have to do.\n\nL-189 The anointed Word of God being vindicated before any man that's born to be a son of God, with the predestinated germ into him for this hour, he'll see God's Message as sure as there's a God in Heaven. Martin Luther saw It for his. Wesley saw It for his. The pentecostal saw It for his. Now what about you? See? They went into a denomination. Here is the Word condemning it; telling you what we're to have today, and just exactly Malachi 4 and all these other promises for the hour. What do you see? What are you looking at? Amen. Here we are. The real, genuine eagles hear. \"My sheep know My Voice. The stranger they'll not follow.\" [John 10:4-5]\n\nL-190 Why? It was put in there by predestination. You were foreordained to a son of God. You were in God before the foundation of the world. You're only manifested in this day for His honor and glory. How can you do it without honoring His Word, and stand with every Word of God? Yes, sir. Which, you are a part of that Word, by predestination. Because, look, the God is the Word. You believe it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Well, then, if... He always was the Word. \"In the beginning was the Word.\" And if the Word was God, then you were in God. The Word, the part that you're to play, was in God before the foundation of the world. He seen you. He knew you. He predestinated you to it. [Romans 8:29-35], [John 1:1-5]\n\nL-191 I tell you, just as that eagle recognized that voice, so does a--a real, born-again Christian recognize the Voice of God speaking through the Word, when they see It anointed and a vindicated. Look. He looked up There. He didn't see this old hen cluck-cluck around here, \"Join us and go over here. And go this, and go to this and that.\" He saw a--a being like he wanted to be, sailing in the air, screaming, free, up in the highs, above all the vultures and things of the 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min earth. Hallelujah! He wanted to be that because it was in him to be that. [John 10:15-18, 26-30]\n\nL-192 And a man that's born of God, a son of God, has to have the nature of God. He has to be like God. He honors God. He is part of the Word of God. And in this last days, of this Bride taking form, just exactly the same power that He was in at the beginning, has come up through these organizations, and so forth, and come out for the Bride. He can't be nothing else but that.\n\nL-193 They ought to have seen It, them Jews in their days, when they seen It manifested there before them, as the prophet said He was. He said, \"Search the Scriptures; in Them you think you have Eternal Life. They are They that testify of Me. If I do not the works of My Father, don't believe Me. But though you can't believe Me, do believe the works that I've done.\" [John 5:36-39] They said, \"Our fathers eat manna in the wilderness for forty years. We know where we're at.\" He said, \"And they're every one dead,\" that's, Eternally separated. Everyone died. There was only three, two come out of a million, two million. That's one in a million. [John 6:49]\n\nL-194 Why, an injection, the sperm from male and female, there's usually one egg fertile. There's one egg, one germ that's fertile, you ever seen hybreeding in cattle. Notice. Here is a--a million eggs; here is a million germs; and when they are--are discharged, to come together to the womb, coming through the tube and into the womb, they meet. One of them is eggs. A million eggs; a million germs. There's only one egg in there fertile. There's only one germ fertile. They're all alive. You can watch them little calves beating around in there, a speck that you could put on a match stem.\n\nL-195 And Demos and them is listening in tonight, and he remembers when we took them. He took me down there, showed me how that worked. Test tubes, and put just in enough that you could put on the end of a match. It was thousands of little calves and bulls in there, but it's only one of them can live. Only one of them! And here is a big ball of them, here. And you'll notice, one will crawl out from among this one here, go right over, the germ come over here; and an egg will come from among these other eggs over here, and they'll meet together. And the rest of them die. Yet, they're alive, but they die.\n\nL-196 Because, there is Something, Someone made this one fertile, and ordained this one, too. It's predestination, my brother. Sure. God has to determine whether it's going to be boy or girl, red-head, black-head, or whatever it is. It's determined by God. More mystery than a virgin birth, to me. But, notice, the rest of them die.\n\nL-197 There were two million people come out, sung, shouted, done everything. Spoke in... not ever spoke in tongues. But they shouted, and--and give God glory, and danced up-and-down the sea, and done everything that all the rest of them did, but there were only two went into the promised land. Caleb went in, Caleb and Joshua, only two. That's one out of a million. It's one out of a million in natural birth. Every one of them had the same blessing. Oh, you Pentecostals, I hope you don't wake up too late.\n\nL-198 One out of a million. Look. There is supposed to be five hundred million so-called Christians in the world today. If Jesus would come, there'd only be five hundred go with Him, then, if that statistic would run true. Why, there's more than that missing every day, over the world. They know nothing about it.\n\nL-199 \"'I understand,' said the scribes, 'you know that... ' Why does the scribes say that--that, 'Elias must first come'?\" They said to Jesus. He said, \"Elias has already come and you didn't know it.\" See? He did just exactly what the Scriptures said was to happen to Him. See? \"So must the Son of man suffer. Under...\" They didn't recognize Him. Yet, they were all in the church. All claimed to be alive. [Matthew 17:12]\n\nL-200 You set a real, born-again Christian, a real servant of God, hear that Word of God, he'll come right out through every denomination, to that real fertile ground, by the Word, the bedding ground. He'll just do it. I don't know how he does it. God has ordained it to be done.\n\nL-201 You was deceived in the beginning, by your first marriage. Now you know what's true. Just like I said, the little eagle when he heard the Bridegroom's Voice, he went to It, the anointed, vindicated Word of God for the last day.\n\nL-202 Noah was the vindicated Word for his day. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Well, his 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min message won't work today.\n\nL-203 Moses was the vindicated Word of his day. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] It won't work for now. Jesus was...\n\nL-204 John was the vindicated Word. You believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] It wouldn't work in the days of Jesus. Certainly not. No, sir. \"Law and prophets were until John; since then, the Kingdom of Heaven.\"\n\nL-205 The apostles, them who set forth the Bible. Here come Luther out, in reformation, his words, that, his church, won't work today. Wesley's won't. Pentecostal's won't. It worked in their day.\n\nL-206 But it's another day. This is the opening of the Seven Seals. I know It sounds strange to you, but God has vindicate it so perfectly. There's no--no question in It. Just perfectly! I ain't scattering that to the local assembly here. I'm speaking to the people out across the nation. See? Do what you wish to.\n\nL-207 Now notice the anointed Word of his day, of which you are a part, by predestination. You immediately, like, knew. When you heard That, you knew right quick that you was an eagle. You also realized that you wasn't a denominational chicken, to begin with. You knowed there is something wrong there. There is something wrong, that's right, for you know that you were trapped into it, at the beginning.\n\nL-208 He, the Bridegroom, took away your shame, \"And put it in the Sea of Forgetfulness, by the washing of the Water of the Word and the Blood of Life.\" That's what the Bible said. Your first husband that you were married to, the world; the anointed Bridegroom, which foreordained you, has washed you by the washing of the Water. By \"the church\"? [Congregation says, \"No.\"--Ed.] That don't sound right. Does it? [\"No.\"] You might find that in the almanac, but not in God's Bible. \"By the washing of the Water by the Word.\" In the Word! See? By the...\n\nL-209 You are standing completely justified, as though you never did it at the beginning. This is my Message to the Church now. As you... as we go off the air, just in a minute. You are standing, if you're standing on God's Word and with God's Word, every amen, every jot, every tittle. Where you standing? I'm trying to tell you, pull away from them shucks. And get out here in the wheat, where you can get ripe before the Son. I hear the coming of the combine. You're standing complete, justified, like you never did it in the first place. Hallelujah! [Acts 13:19], [Romans 3:24], [Romans 5:1, 9], [Romans 8:30]\n\nL-210 Talk about a thanksgiving! I feel real good. I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of.\n\nL-211 You are the pure, virtuous, sinless Bride of the Son of the living God. Every man and woman that's born of the Spirit of God, and washed in the Blood of Jesus Christ, and believes every Word of God, stands as though you never sinned at the first place. You are perfect. The Blood of Jesus Christ! How can you... If a man... [Acts 13:19], [Romans 3:24], [Romans 5:1, 9], [Romans 8:30]\n\nL-212 If I was supposed to die in the morning, a man took my place, I cannot die for that sin. Somebody took my place. And Jesus, the Word, took my place. He become me, that a sinner, that I might become Him, the Word. Amen. Let me hold true to It, not the church. The Word! Amen.\n\nL-213 Oh, that spiritual union of Christ and His Church now, when the flesh is becoming Word, and the Word is becoming flesh, manifested, vindicated. Just what the Bible said would happen in this day, it's happening, day by day. Why, it's cumulating so fast out there, in those deserts, and things taking place, that I couldn't even keep up with it. We're near the Coming of Jesus, to be united with His Church, where the Word becomes the Word. Call of the Holy Spirit, searching the hearts! [I Corinthians 15:51-54], [I Thessalonians 4:15-18]\n\nL-214 You're standing, completely. You never sinned at the first place. God don't even know. It's in the Sea of Forgetfulness. You never did it. You were accused of it, by the accuser. But really, from the beginning, you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God. You're standing there, washed. And your old book of divorcement is put away, and it's dead, absolutely out of existence, even in the mind of God. [Romans 8:30]\n\nL-215 You're the virtuous Bride of Christ, washed in the Blood of Christ. Precious, virtuous, sinless Son of God standing with a pure, unadulterated Bride-Word that He washed by the Water of His Own Blood; that become flesh and 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min manifested, that He might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the Father, before the beginning, the same as He was. He was that great attribute of God, called \"love.\" [Revelation 19:7-8]\n\nL-216 Whatever you are, you are servants of God, whatever God wants you to do, where your place is. \"God placed in the Church, some apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors...\" He placed that by virtue of His Own predestination. And you were that, to begin with.\n\nL-217 Your first wedding was annulled. It was. You never done it, in the first place. Because, there's only one thing could do it, that would be God come down, Himself, and took your place in a form of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, and washed you by the Water, of the washing of the Water by the Word. The Word; not the denomination! The Word washed you. But if you won't stand in the Water of the Word, how you going to be washed? You're still as spotted as Eve was. Oh, dear dying Lamb, Thy precious Blood Shall never lose Its power, Till all the ransomed Church of God Be saved to sin no more.\n\nL-218 What is sin? Sin is \"unbelief.\" Unbelief in (what?) the Word; unbelief in God, which is the Word.\n\nL-219 Pure, unadulterated; oh, hallelujah; leaving soon for the skies; amen; standing ready. Think. Your garments, washed by the Water of the bleeding Word! The Word become Blood. The Word bled for you, and you are washed in bleeding Word. The Word, bleeding! The Life of God in the Word, and the Word was bled for you, that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes, and be cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the Water of the Word, and makes your mind and heart stayed on God and on His Word.\n\nL-220 Now, how you know It's true? When God comes down and vindicates It and prove. You say, \"Well, I didn't believe It that way.\" They didn't believe It Jesus' way, but God proved It. They didn't believe It Noah's way. They didn't believe It Moses' way. They was willing to take Balaam's word for It, \"We're all the same, so let's just associate together.\" \"Separate yourself,\" the Bible said, \"from unbelief.\"\n\nL-221 Hallelujah! Now notice. You're not only that, but you're going to the Wedding in the sky. And you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated, unmerited grace, a wedding band of grace unmerited of your own. God did it, Himself. He knew you before the foundation of the world, so He slipped the wedding band on you There, put your name on a Book. What a thanksgiving! Hallelujah! Praise our God!\n\nL-222 Now, in closing, I might say this. We all know that the modern church, Pentecostal, in its present condition, all the denominations together! I'll throw them all in one bundle, 'cause they are. Remember, He's going to bundle the weeds, first, and burn them. Take the... He takes all the wheat stalks and burn it all up, first; then He take, come and gets His wheat and takes it Home. They're all gathering in a bundle, bundle of Methodists, Baptists, Pentecostals, all going to Ecumenical Council. That's all. They're all burned. See?\n\nL-223 We all know that the modern church, in its present condition and its present state, is in no condition to finish up the great commission that God gave the Church for this day. How many Pentecostal can say \"amen\" to that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Right. See? It's in...\n\nL-224 We're oneness, twoness, threeness, this, that, other, fuss, fight. One is this, and one is that, and other. And every one of them, afraid to face the Word, right down to the test. See? They know. You tell them about It; they say, \"I--I can't help it. I can't believe That. I don't care what he does. I...\" See? See? See? Shows what mammy and pappy you have. \"You might be a state presbyter some day. You might be this, that, or the other.\" You better be a son of God.\n\nL-225 Now, we know that the church could not, the Pentecostal church, by no means, by no means, could carry out the last-day Message, in its present condition. Could it? [Congregation says, \"No.\"--Ed.] Why, it can't even agree on one or two Words in the Bible. How you going to do it? It can't do it. So, you see, denomination is out. That's right. It's going to be an elected people that's elected for it. See? 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min\n\nL-226 Now know, and so do every one of us know, that the whole rank of denominationals, Pentecostal and all, are dead, that is, to the born-again Christian of the Message. Uh-huh. Your first husband is dead. You know he's dead. God let it die. It's finished. All of its scientific, intellectual, educational, scientific ways of its so-called Bible schools and things is perished. What's it done? Separated, oneness here, and trinities here, and twoness here, and over here, and down here, and such a mess up, and call themselves Pentecostals.\n\nL-227 Why, I went to a young man, other day; is listening right in, right now. And a young woman, she belonged to a certain church. She said... I said... They separated. I said, \"What's the matter?\" Said, \"We're a different faith.\" I said, \"Oh, I'm sorry. Are you Catholic?\" She said, \"No.\" She told me the denomination church she belonged to, a Pentecostal. I said, \"What are you?\" He's Pentecostal, too, but another denomination. Oh!\n\nL-228 You know, the Roman Catholic church started off, Pentecostal? How many knows that true? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] It taken it two thousand years to get where it's got now, just don't take nothing of the Scripture no more. Nothing. Why, the Pentecostal, in twenty years from now, will be worse than they are now, it keeps on going the way it is now. Why, sure. See? What is it? What is it? Look who their papa and mama is. Let their women cut their hair. They can do nearly anything they want to. \"As long as they belong to the church, that's all is necessary.\"\n\nL-229 Oh, no wonder, no wonder the damnation of God heaps up! God put It right before your eyes. You shut your eyes and fail to look at It. Yeah. Shutting up your bowels of compassion, when you see the true Word of God and these Seven Seals being vindicated and proved to be so. And witness in the heavens, across the nations and everywhere else, by great signs and wonders that He promised He would do, then you shut up, say, \"I--I don't know. I--I can't help it. I...\" See? Oh, my! It's dead, and don't know it. Sins and trespasses! You're dead. Oh, my!\n\nL-230 We all know that the church in that condition couldn't finish up this last day. How could it bring Malachi 4 in? How could it do it? They don't even believe in such a thing. How could it believe, bring in Luke 17:30? How could it bring in all these other Scriptures that's promised this last day? It couldn't do it, because it denies It. \"As it was in the days of Lot, so shall it be in the Coming of the Son of man.\" [Malachi 4:5-6], [Luke 17:30] Look at the condition, Lot, that Sodom was in, in that day. Look, condition the church of the day. Look what happened to Abraham, the Elected. Look what happened to Lot and them down in Sodom. Look at the Billy Graham and Oral Roberts, them down there amongst those denomination. Look at the elected Abraham Church, pulled out.\n\nL-231 Look what kind of sign, that Jesus Himself, the incarnated God standing there in human flesh. You say, \"That was an Angel.\" The Bible said It was God. Lord God, Elohim, standing there in human flesh, showing that He would so anoint His Church in the last days. It'd be God working in human flesh again. \"As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be at the Coming of the Son of man.\" Same kind of a thing. They see it right there in the Scriptures. Read the... \"Search the Scriptures, for in Them you think you have Eternal Life.\" And They are They that testify of This. See? See? [Luke 17:28-30], [John 5:39] So we know they're dead. God let it die in its own selfish, scientific, educational program.\n\nL-232 All the Pentecostals used to talk about--about sending their kid away to Bible school, back when old Brother Loyate, them was around here, and they'd run you out of the church. \"But, oh, now it's the greatest thing. My son is away in Bible school.\" He's digging his grave. So, now, you think they could take It, today? You think I'm trying to support ignorance? I'm not. I'm telling you there's a difference between this intellectual age that we're living in, where the church has been pregnated with science and all these so-called \"figured out\" and everything. You don't figure out God.\n\nL-233 Well, them--them priests had God figured out so perfect. They knowed how the Messiah was going to come, but He come so different from what they had figured out. It wasn't scientific. \"How could this Man, being an illegitimate Child? Where did He go to school at? Where did His education come from? Where did He get this learning?\" 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min \"Why, You try to teach us? You're born in fornications.\" See? Oh, for goodness sake! See the same thing repeat again? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] See it repeat again? All in their religious science, religious science according to what their Bible school said, that's the way they want It. \"That's the way It has to be, or It isn't.\"\n\nL-234 God just fools them, every time. It always comes different. It did in Noah's time; did in Moses' time; did in Christ's time; did in John's time; did in disciples' time; did in Wesley's time; did in Luther's time; did in Pentecostal time; and so has it again. It don't change Its pattern. Always comes the same thing. Only reformers through them seven, six ages, till the seventh. And Revelation 10 said, in this hour it'll change. And it did.\n\nL-235 Now we're closing, in saying this. Finish up the great commission, how could they do it? We know they're dead. God let it die in this scientific age, all of it, so--so He could (do what?) open up the Seven-Seal mystery to the undenominational Bride. How can a denomination accept those Seven Seals, when It's absolutely contrary, serpent's seed and all those other things? The whole, full seven mysteries is contrary to what they been taught, because they took the old school from their Bible school.\n\nL-236 And the Seven Seals of God, when It was opened there on the mountain, God will let me die right now at this pulpit if That ain't the Truth. And I foretold you, a year and six months before it happened, what He told me, \"Go to Arizona,\" and what would happen out there in the desert. And there's men setting right here, tonight, was standing right there and present when the seven Angels come down. And even mag-... The magazine, Life magazine, packed the article of It. It's right there in the observatory, everything. Now they don't even know what It's all about. [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-237 And everything has been said, oh, even to the destruction of California, coming up now, and all these other things. And how I told them how many days it would be, how it would be where this big earthquake happened in Alaska, and that would be the beginning of the sign of time, and what would take place. And just word by word, what It said, it's never failed one time. You've never seen It fail. And It can't fail, because It's God's Words. \"And Heaven and earth will pass away, but It can't fail.\" That's right.\n\nL-238 God had to open up those Seven Seals, not in a denomination. I've always been against it. But, out of denomination, He might take a Bride, not a denominational bride. He couldn't do it. It's against His Own Word. He opened those seven mysteries in there. That shows forth, brings forth those things that's been hid since the foundation of the world, might be revealed in the last days, to sons of God. They brought That forth now before the people, that they see It there, you now, to this undenominational Bride. Oh, my!\n\nL-239 There is your two books. One of them is the Lamb's Book of Life. Your name on There is predestinated on There. It can't go, because you can no more take that away than nothing, see, because it was foreordained to be on There. But the regular book of life, can take that off at any time. See? You don't repent, it's off, anyhow, 'cause you're going to stand the Judgment. The Bride don't even stand the Judgment; goes in the Rapture. Just as... I say this, in closing. It's getting late, so it's almost nine-thirty. And we're going to be out of here by nine-thirty, the Lord willing. Just real reverent now, listen. One time...\n\nL-240 Saying this now, this goes across the nation. In New York, now it's twenty-five minutes after eleven. Way up in Philadelphia and around through there, those dear saints setting there listening, right now, in churches all around. Way up, way down around Mexico, way up around in Canada and all around, across. Two hundred miles, anywhere within the North America continent here, almost, people is at it, listening right now. Thousands times thousands, listening.\n\nL-241 That's my Message to you, Church, you that's a union, spiritual union by the Word, that you're dead to these old husbands. You're born anew. Don't try to dig him up. He's dead. If you're a born-again Christian, that little germ that was predestinated to you, it's Word coming on Word, on Word, on Word, on Word, and come into full statue of Christ, that's right, so He can come get His Bride. Now we're just ready for one thing, that's the Coming of the Lord.\n\nL-242 There is your name on the Book of Life. The Book of Life is the Word of God, 'cause the Word is God, and God is the only thing that is Life. So your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible become on Word. And if 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min you're here to do that, won't It vindicate that Word? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Won't the Church vindicate Itself? Won't Malachi 4, all these other things, perfectly, perfectly vindicate Itself and show that That's what It is? [\"Amen.\"]\n\nL-243 When Jesus come, He said, \"If I do not the works is promised for Me to do, don't believe Me.\" Which one of the groups did He join? He said, \"They all... You're of your father, the Devil, and his works you do.\" See? See? [John 10:37], [John 8:41-44] We're in the last days, Church. That's my thanksgiving Message to you.\n\nL-244 Now, before closing. One time I was up in Glacier National Park. We heard, all day long, that they had a--they had a fall, a glacier fire that was going to fall at night. So the people was busy, all day long, getting that thing ready, because they was going to pour that fire out, that night. They put a liquid fire falls, like a great glacier of water. But it's... Looked like a rainbow, almost, when it comes out, of that fire falling out of this glacier. All around through the park, wife and I, and children, walked around through the day. We want to stay to see that fire exhibition. So it--it--it was promised us that we would see it, and we'd witness it again. They said they have it ever through the summer seasons and so forth. I said, \"Well, will we be able to see it?\"\n\nL-245 Said, \"We promised it tonight. We're promised that.\" Said, \"They're up there getting it ready now.\"\n\nL-246 After all had been made ready for the event! That's what's taking place right now. All has been made ready for the event, a Church being pulled out for His Name's sake, taking His Bride out from amongst the world, these denominations and all the world, and the filth and things of the world. Everybody; the event was made ready. Everybody was standing out. They said, \"Now keep watching, right up on top the mountain there.\" That's the way It's always come. That's the way It's to come this time. That's the way It always come. Not through a denomination! Never did God use a denomination, never!\n\nL-247 The reformer goes forth, he gets the Word of the Lord. And then when he dies, they build a denomination out of it. That's what the Pentecostals and all did. When the new issues, everything, that's just the way. That's the way the thing come out. A new word added, then they build a church out of it, made a denomination, separated themself. It had to be that way.\n\nL-248 Now, you can't beat--you can't beat nature. Nature falls in the same routine, all the time: stalk, leaf, tassel, so forth, shuck, then the wheat. Now notice. All was ready. Everything had been kindled and made ready. And everybody was standing out. I had my head sticking up; my arm around my wife. We was looking. And children standing there, all of us looking up, like that. My! It was something, 'cause we was expecting it. It was promised to us.\n\nL-249 Amen! The Word promises This. \"It shall come to pass, before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come, behold, I will send unto you Elijah the prophet. He shall turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers.\"...?... \"It shall come to pass in the last days, I'll pour out My Spirit from on High.\" \"The former and latter rain shall come together in the last day.\" All these promises, through the Scriptures, been given. We're looking upward. Watch at the true Bride across the nation this hour, looking up. Church, He is coming, one of these days. Just as sure as He come the first time, He is coming again. Get everything ready. Separate yourself from shuck. Lay before the Son. Keep looking up. Be under expectation. [Malachi 4:5-6], , [Joel 2:28-29], [James 5:7]\n\nL-250 All at once, we heard something from the top the hill, a voice come down through the loud speaker, said, \"All things are ready.\" Then this man, standing right there by the side of me, said, \"Let the fire fall.\" Here it come, pouring down across that mountain, a glacier of fire and blazes a licking, a sight to behold.\n\nL-251 Brother, let's get all things ready, for one of these days the Fire is going to fall. We're going up. Now let's get ready for the Fire-falling time. We're in the last days, we all know that, and we're ready for the Coming of the Lord. The thing to do is separate yourself from all sin. Separate yourself from anything that pertains to the world. \"Don't love 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min the world or the things of the world.\" \"Let no man, by his creed, deceive you.\" You stay right straight in the promise of God, the Word of God. And that Word, if It's a Word for this day, God vindicates It so. If He doesn't, it's not the Word for this day.\n\nL-252 The Word that fell on the Day of Pentecost will not work this day. No, sir. That was for Pentecost. This is for the Bride, going Home of the Bride. We got something different. The Pentecostals represented that, again. We're in the Bride age. No more than the--the Word of Noah would work in the days of Moses; no more than Moses' law would have worked in the time of Paul here. He tried to tell them, \"You are dead to that, and you cannot have that.\" [I Thessalonians 4:15-18], [I Corinthians 15:51-54]\n\nL-253 Church, you who I'm speaking to, tonight, across the nation, if--if you've separated yourself from denomination and all the filth and things of this world, and all those things that keeps you in man-made creeds and orders and things like that, you separated yourself. Look up. Get ready. The Fire is going to fall, one of these days. God is going to let Him come, and a sight to behold. Would you be ready when He comes? Would you be ready to go up with Him when He comes? The secret Rapture of the supernatural Bride, \"She'll be made mor-... from mortal to immortality; be changed, in a moment, in a twinkling of eye. We which are alive and remain shall not prevent them which are asleep.\"\n\nL-254 The other day, on Armistice Day, I was standing down there in Tucson. My little boy wanted to see the parade. I was studying, and I didn't have time to do it. I had a lot of sick calls and things. So he said, \"Daddy, they won't take me.\" He said, \"Take me.\"\n\nL-255 I said, \"All right.\" Brother Simpson, I think he's here; and his little boy wanted to go. So I jerked them in the car and run down. I stood there on the corner and watched. And after while, I heard, way back in the distance, a muffle coming, \"womp, womp,\" drums, beating. I stood there. I thought, \"Well, these little fellows, they really read all these books about army. They'll really like that.\" I noticed, coming up first was the old World War I tank. There they come up, little bitty fellows like that. There was next come, after that; was the next come after that was the big new tank of the Second World War, the big Sherman tank with a muzzle break on it. Then come the next, and the next, and after while come the Gold Star Mothers.\n\nL-256 And then, after while, come twelve veterans that's left, in the whole state of Arizona, from the First World War; twelve veterans. After that, come a float, the unknown soldier, the little white cross. There stood a sailor, marine, and a soldier, standing guard; a little partition on the float. On the other side was an old gray-headed mother, setting with a gold star pinned on her, a little lovely wife crying, her husband was dead; a little ragged boy, his head turned sideways. His daddy was killed. And then behind that come more and more and more, and then to the new army. I stood there. What a sight to behold, but how sad!\n\nL-257 I thought, \"O God, one of these days I'm going to behold another sight.\" They'll come forth a resurrection day, which, \"The first will be last; they which are last will be first.\" The old prophets will come breaking forth, first, and they see that procession going, marching up in the air. \"And we which are alive and remain shall not hinder them which are asleep. For the trumpet of God shall sound, the dead in Christ shall rise first.\" We'll fall right in line with them going in, hallelujah, all down through the age of Luther, Wesley, Methodist, Presbyterian, on down to the last age, who received the Word in their age. God bless you. Get all things ready, and the Fire will fall. [I Thessalonians 4:16-18]\n\nL-258 Let's bow our heads just a moment. I wonder, in this visible audience tonight, while I've held you here for... till nine-thirty. Is there one here, is there a dozen here, how many here, and says, \"Brother Branham, I'm ashamed of myself, the way I've lived. I have catered a lot to a denomination and men. I know that I'm not up with the Word of God. I'm just going to ask you to pray for me, Brother Branham\"? Raise up your hand. God bless you. God bless you. Just look, way up into the balconies, around. God bless you. \"I know...\" Now don't be ashamed. Now, don't be.\n\nL-259 And out yonder, across the nation, from New York to California, from Canada to Mexico, you people that's gathered in those churches where those faithful little groups that's believed this Message with all their hearts. They've 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min come out, come out of great tribulation, come out through those denominations. They're germs of Life. Do you feel the urging, tonight, like the little eagle, that you hear Something that's a little different from what you've heard, but, yet, in your heart you know it's the Truth? You, in there, there's a pastor standing there somewhere. You got your hand up. I'm going to pray for you.\n\nL-260 These things wasn't done in a corner, friend. Remember, \"Strait is the gate and narrow is the way, and but few there'll be that will find it.\" Don't go with that crowd that's moving on yonder, friend, that Laodicea Church Age. It could jump up-and-down, dance under music, lukewarm. Didn't say it was ice cold now. It said, \"It was lukewarm,\" that's the Pentecostal, \"and don't know that it's miserable, wretched, blind.\" Blind to what? The Word, to the manifestation of the Word, because It never come through their organizations. They cannot receive It. [Matthew 7:14]\n\nL-261 And you ministers down there in Tucson, tonight, I don't hold you responsible for that. God does. I was there for three years. I told you I wouldn't start a church. I didn't. Brother Pearry Green started it. I was there three years, and not one time did you invite me to your pulpit. I set in Tucson for nearly three years. God will take me from the desert one of these days. This Message must live. I tried my best to get in to you. I--I know the reason you did it. You hear? Only reason you did it, your denomination would kick you out. And you know, many of you I've talked to, there at Furr's Restaurant, and you know it's the truth. Shame on you. Come out of it. Get out of there, brother. If there's any Life in you, you'll be like that little eagle I just spoke of, you'll hear the Word of God. Remember, you're going to hear This for the last time, one of these days. We're real close now. Won't you come, tonight?\n\nL-262 Dear God, we set solemnly now, a thanksgiving day it really is, Lord. I am grateful, Lord, to be living in this day. This is the greatest day. Paul the apostle longed to see this day. The great men of old longed to see it. The prophets longed to see it. They looked for this day. Abraham looked for this day, for he sought for a City whose Builder and Maker was God; it hangs right above us, tonight. John seen the Spirit of God descending out of Heaven, bore record, knowed that that was the Son of God. And, think now, He's choosing His Bride.\n\nL-263 Dear God, out across the land everywhere, speak to their heart. You're the only One can change their heart. If that wasn't Seed put in there at the beginning, they'll never see It, Lord. They're just... \"The blind will lead the blind. They'll fall in the ditch,\" as sure as anything, because Your Word says they will.\n\nL-264 Now, Father, being that we see across the country, around the world, in Africa, dozens, dozens through South Africa, Mozambique, all across the country, little assemblies taking these tapes. And so will this tape go to twenty-some odd, different nations. They're beginning to see It and pull away, hundreds and hundreds of them. Won't take many, Lord. Then when the last member is received into the Body, Christ will come. Lord God, I'm asking the Bride, tonight, the ones that I feel has pulled away and waiting. May they separate themselves from everything in the world. They must lay in the Presence of the warm Son Light of the Son of God, bathing in His Word, in His love. Grant it, dear God.\n\nL-265 May these people here, visible, that held up their hand, tonight, dozens of them though this great tabernacle. I pray, God, that new Life will come into them. I pray it, for across the nation and even around the world, where the tape will be played, that they also will receive this thanksgiving Message and know, by the hints and things that's been throwed, what they must do. I pray it, Father. Grant it. Bless them. They're Yours.\n\nL-266 I know it's customary now, Father, that we ask the people to the altar. I pray, dear God, that in every mission, everywhere around, and in across the world, that they will come to the altar: the black, the white, yellow, brown, wherever they are; the rich, the poor, the indifferent, the beggars, whatever they are. The denominationals, those who set self-styled and self-centered, O God, \"Naked, miserable, wretched, blind, and don't even know it.\" You said it would be that way, and it's that way. So I pray, Father, that You'll call every Seed, tonight. And everywhere around the world that This may fall, may It catch that little eagle that knows the Voice of his Lord. Grant it, Lord. I commit them to You, in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-267 Now with your heads bowed, here in the visible audience. Would some here, that hasn't been saved, not even 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min given your heart to God, don't you think you ought to be thankful for what Jesus did for you? To think, that you are a sinner, that you're an alien from God, and yet Something at your heart, knocking. [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit--Ed.] How do you know but what you are one of those little eagles! You are miserable, and will be miserable, till you surrender to It. Why not make this one of the greatest thanksgiving you ever had, when you received Jesus Christ as your Saviour.\n\nL-268 Will you come up here and stand at the altar? I'll pray with you if you will come, any sinner, man or woman, boy or girl, church member or not church member. Church member doesn't make you a Christian now. The altar is open. Will you come, any sinner that would want to come, receive the Lord Jesus Christ. Would like to really quit...\n\nL-269 Some of you denominationals that would like to quit feeding on that chicken food, of saying, \"You belong to this and it's all right.\" You really want to know what the real baptism of the Holy Ghost is? Come, find out.\n\nL-270 The altar is open. We're ready. Just come right up, out--out of your seat. Come right on up and kneel down here at the altar, this brother that's just come. \"Thanksgiving, O God, I'm so thankful to You. That, all my life, I've knowed there's been something, Lord. I've never been satisfied. I've tried. I--I thought, 'Next year, I'll do it. The next week, I'll do it, next time I hear an altar call. I will, some day.' I put it off, and put it off. But, Lord, I know there is something wrong with me. I'll always believe that there was something different. And now, Lord, tonight, I'm thankful for a preparation that's been made by the Son of God, that my sins, actually my unbelief, would be washed away from me. I'm coming, tonight, and kneel down to accept the great thanksgiving blessing that Jesus Christ did for me when He died for me at Calvary.\"\n\nL-271 Will you come? Now there's people kneeling around the altar here. Why don't you get up and come? You've wanted to do it. You've tried it.\n\nL-272 Just think of Brother Lyle Palmer, our good, precious brother. He was setting in the yard, so I understand, looking at his little girl playing croquet out there, or something, and he pitched over in the chair and was dead before he could even make a move. You don't know what time you're going to leave here. You just don't know what time that you're going. It may be yet, tonight, so why not come and settle it now?\n\nL-273 Come on, people. Can't you feel Something tugging at you? I--I know there's many of you here that should be right here at the altar, and just this six or seven people here is not what is setting in here. Now, if you believe me and watch here at the platform, things happening, you believe me now. One day my voice will be stilled. You won't hear it no more. You might wish you would have come.\n\nL-274 You say, \"But, Brother Branham, I been a church member.\" That don't make any difference what you've been. So had--so had Nicodemus been a church member. So had John, Peter, James, Paul, all the rest of them been church members. Paul was a church member until something happened one night, or one day it was, and he come. He was a changed church member then, to a son of God. Won't you come? Oh, he was trained. He was intellectual. He knowed he was trained, one of the greatest-trained schools there was, Gamaliel, one of the finest teachers there was in the land. But he knowed he needed something. Won't you come? Once more I ask you. In where... Here or around the nation, I ask you, wherever you are, in what assembly you are, at this thanksgiving hour. Remember, I'm being taped here; not only here, but in Heaven.\n\nL-275 You know, it's scientifically proved that every move you make is recorded. They prove that. Remember, television proved that. The television doesn't--doesn't manufacture the picture. You're the picture. It just transmits that what you're doing, into a channel. You're there, anyhow. See? When you move your finger, that move goes around the world. Every time that you put on a dress, your looks goes around the world. It's on a record. Every thought that goes through your mind is on a record. And some day the record is going to quit playing, it's going to be put in the album.\n\nL-276 And then at the Judgment it's going to be come back. There you stand with bobbed hair, claiming to be a Christian. There you stand with thoughts in your mind against the Word, and it's right in your mind. You can't hide it. Remember, television, science even knows that's true. You standing right now, knowing that you should be here, 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min remember, when this is recorded. At the Day of the Judgment, that same thought that you're having will be coming right back through your mind again. That will be right on record. The whole world will see it played. Why don't the world.... Looking at you, on the Day of the Judgment, all the Angels there.\n\nL-277 \"If you're ashamed of Me here, when your picture is being made now, at the Day of the Judgment I'll be ashamed of you. For, I anointed My Word, sent It to you. You wouldn't believe It. You hid yourself behind something.\" [Mark 8:38], [Luke 9:26]\n\nL-278 \"Oh,\" you say, \"I'm good enough. I've done this. I've danced in the Spirit. I've spoke in tongues.\" So does the heathen. \"I shouted.\" So does the heathen. How can you turn back on the Word then? Why not? Why not come to Him now? Why not? Why not? Why not come to Him now? Why do you wait, dear brother? Oh, why do you tarry so long? Jesus is waiting to save you A place in His sanctified Home. Put you one of the members of His Body! Why not? Oh, little eagle, come now. Oh, why not come?\n\nL-279 Lord, I'm thankful. I'm very thankful. Thanksgiving to You, Lord; not for natural food, yet that. But, Lord, the end time is here. I'm thankful for this spiritual Food, Lord, the spiritual Food of the Seven Seals was promised to be opened. You say, \"That'll be something different.\" No, no.\n\nL-280 You can't add one word. And take... It's already in There, just hid. It's sealed. How many understands that? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] See? You say, \"Well, that's a mystery will come forth.\" Oh, no. It's already Writ. You can't add one word to It, or take one from It. See? It's already in There. It's just got to be revealed in the last day.\n\nL-281 Won't you come? Come on now, friend. If you can't understand, come. Kneel down, talk to Him about It. If I can't make It plain to you, He will, for He is a--a Dissolver of all doubts. ... in His sanctified throne. Oh, why won't you come? Why not? Why not come to Him now?\n\nL-282 Remember, there's a recording making of this, not only on this tape, but God's great record. Each one of you, every move, when you bow your head, bow your heart, what thought goes through your mind, remember, it's being recorded right now in Glory, and the record is going to be played on the Day of Judgment. Where is your decision? Oh, how you'll want it changed, at that Day.\n\nL-283 I'm just going to wait, 'cause there's many, many, around the altar now. See? Maybe one of them, if I held just a little longer, there might be another one out there, might be somewhere in New York, it might be somewhere in Philadelphia, out in California, Arizona. Somewhere, there might be another one coming. Pastor, wherever you are, don't give the altar call up now.\n\nL-284 We may never see another Thanksgiving. This might be the last one, and records will be put up, tonight, for the last time. The tape will run out, one of these days. The record will be cut and will be in God's album. Then it's going to be played back, what your thoughts is now. Don't say you didn't know different. You do. \"But no man can come to Me, 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min except My Father draws him. And all the Father has given Me, they will come.\" ... come to Him? [John 6:44]\n\nL-285 I believe, if I was setting out there somewhere, and I had the least thought, I'd sure take up here as hard as I could. Oh, why not? Why?\n\nL-286 Are you finished? You sure you're not grieving His Spirit now? Let's keep our heads bowed then. You sure you haven't grieved His Spirit? You sure you've done just exactly what He told you to do? You positive now? Remember, you--you might not never have another chance. The record may be finished up, tonight. This may be all of it. This may be the last tape for you. Are you sure you're ready now? If so, I leave it in your hands, in the Name of the Lord Jesus.\n\nL-287 Now while the choir is singing softly, I'm going to pray for these that's down here. I'm just kind of a very odd sort of a Christian. I believe that God has to do the saving. I believe God has to plant the Word. \"I the Lord,\" says the Bible, Isaiah, \"I the Lord hath planted It. I'll water It, day and night, lest some should pluck It from My hand.\" Before I ask anyone to come around the altar with these people, I want to pray for them, myself. Let's bow our heads now. [Isaiah 27:3], [John 10:28]\n\nL-288 Dear Jesus, I just quoted Your Word, that Your prophet said, and I know the words of the prophets are true. And You said, \"I the Lord hath planted It.\" Why, certainly, You put It on the Lamb's Book of Life, before the foundation of the world. \"I the Lord hath planted It, and I'll water It, day and night, unless some should pluck It from My hand.\" These, probably, Lord, has heard a many altar call. But You're still watering at It, Lord. [John 10:28-29] Here they are, tonight. May they just turn loose, tonight, Father, from all of the things of the world, all the sins and troubles that's in their heart, and just sanely, reverently, in their heart, turn loose to Your Word, right now, say, \"Lord Jesus, down in my heart, I've always believed that there was something for me, that I never have received yet. Though I've tried, as the expression has been made tonight, to follow the hen, but there was something seemed strange to me. It didn't sound just right. Then, tonight, I feel that I'm coming now closer into the arms of the living Word. I'm coming here just as reverently, in my right mind. I've settled down here by this altar. I want salvation, Lord, so bad. I'm so hungry! I want You, Lord, to hold me in Your arms, tonight. Not through any emotion, but through the Spirit of love, take me into Your arms, dear God.\n\nL-289 \"I'm Your child. I feel that I'm that eagle they were talking about. Catch me, Lord. I'm jumping. I raised up from my seat, and knelt down here. Catch me, Lord. I'm jumping. Bring me on Your wings, Lord, away from these things of the world. Let me fly away from the filth of this world, from my bad habit, from all my denominational tradition. Let me come only to You, dear God, that Your Holy Spirit might pour into me the forgiveness of all of my doubts. May I, tonight, become Your child, fresh, born, and a new creature, tonight. Catch me. Carry me away, beyond the clucking of the hen. Carry me away, to the Eagle's nest, where there that I could be nurtured by the Word of God, until I'm able to fly.\"\n\nL-290 Grant it, dear God. Take them. They are Yours. This is my prayer with sincerity, praying over dying people. Grant it, Father. I offer this prayer in their behalf. For the glory of God, I ask it. Now with our heads bowed.\n\nL-291 I wonder, around the altar now, it's you that's knelt here. Many of you has claimed to be Christians, but you've felt that there's always something, somewhere, that you didn't possess. You might have done all the religious act. You might have shouted. You might have done all things. Might have danced in the Spirit. You might have spoke in tongues. And no one can say anything wrong against that. That's true. That's all good. But, you see, that's gifts of the Spirit, without the Spirit. If the Spirit was there, that feeling wouldn't be feeling condemned like that.\n\nL-292 Do you really, sincerely, here at the altar, believe that right now, while you're here, that just the act of turning yourself loose, not an emotion now, but in genuine, unadulterated faith, that God will receive you and nurture you with His Word until you are eagles, yourself, and can fly? If you do, and you want God to do that, raise up your hand, you that's around the altar down here. God bless you. Each one has their hands up. Now, real quietly, I'm going to ask consecrated men and women who really know God. 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min\n\nL-293 Most of them, it's very strange, it seems like it's that way, altar calls that I make is mostly all men. You know, in a regular run, it's women. But it's all men here. I think there's one woman at the altar, tonight, maybe two. It's usually the women. But, somehow or another, I guess it seem like women think I talk against them. I don't, sister. Three, I believe, somebody said they see. I can't see over the top of the altar here. All right.\n\nL-294 Some of you consecrated Christians come here and stand with me in prayer just a minute. On the altar, wherever you are, on the platform, somebody that really knows God, just knows how to stand here just a few minutes for prayer with them, then we'll dismiss the audience. Everybody be real reverent now. Don't leave. Just come here and stand around.\n\nL-295 Some of you people that really believe This to be the Truth, that we're entering another age. We're entering the Rapture Age. You know the church can't go in its condition, and it can't get any better. It must get worse. How many knows that? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] It's got to get worse. And it can't go like this. See? It's got to be Something, and It's moving right now, friend. It's--it's--it's on, the move is on for the Bride. That's the Truth. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD. [I Corinthians 15:51-54], [I Thessalonians 4:15-18]\n\nL-296 Move up now, consecrated Christians that wants your--your record to find out that, these who come sincerely, that you want to come and offer prayer with them, as your brothers and sisters, come up around the altar. Stand around here just a moment, for prayer. Someone else want to come, stand around here? Just kneel down by them. Just walk, where you men around those men; you women. Sweetly, humbly ask prayer for them. Dear God, help...?...\n\nL-297 \"I surrender all. I surrender my denomination. I surrender my first wedding. I surrender my first husband. I surrender everything, Lord.\" ... -der all. All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all. I surrender all, I surren-...\n\nL-298 You surrender your own idea? Can you surrender your own ideas, to God's Word? All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all. I surrender all, I surrender all. All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender.\n\nL-299 All that believe now, in the audience, stand up. Let's sing it, together, now. I surren-... You all surrender, ready to sing it now? I... To Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surren-...\n\nL-300 Now, you around the altar, if you really surrender, raise your hand up to Him, sing, \"I surrender all. I surrender denomination. I surrender denomination. I surrender church. I surrender myself. I surrender my idea. All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all. To Thee, my...\" I surrender all, I surrender all. All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all. 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min Do you really mean it? I surrender all, [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]\n\nL-301 You here now at the altar. You here that's around the altar, that's prayed. The church has prayed for you. You prayed, yourself. Now there's only one way you can be saved, that's, \"By faith are ye saved, and that by grace.\" The grace of God spoke to you, brought you to the altar. You're seeking God's blessings. You're seeking His Word. You're seeking the Holy Ghost. You're seeking the favors of God. And if you are, and you can, really, with all your heart, surrender it. Now, don't look for any emotion. Look for a Truth, a Truth that's from your heart, by faith. \"Lord, I'm willing to do anything that Your Word commands me to do. I surrender myself, with all that's in me.\" [Ephesians 2:8]\n\nL-302 If you believe that with all your heart, I want you to raise up to your feet, turn around to this church, the audience, and raise your hands up, and we'll sing it together with them, \"I surrender everything that's in me, God. As best of my knowledge, everything that I am, I surrender.\" Step up on this platform here, you that's at the altar. Step right up here on the platform, brethren, right up here, all of you, and brothers and sisters. Looky here, church.\n\nL-303 [A sister says, \"Brother Branham, I belong to church, but lately I'm not--not even in it no more.\"--Ed.] Surrender? [\"The Lord knows where I want to be led by Him. I want...?... to church. And I want the Holy Spirit, be filled with the Spirit. And I'd sooner die, if that's what it takes.\"] Yes. That's right. Do you surrender every bit to Him and His Word? A sister here, out of a denomination. She said, \"I belong to a denomination.\" We don't have to call it. She's a worker in there. But she said, \"Brother Branham, I want to get out to the Truth. I want something deeper than that.\" See?\n\nL-304 Let me quote His Word. \"Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.\" [Luke 6:21]\n\nL-305 Now, you here on the platform, that just come, if you are ready to surrender everything that you are, everything, to obey the Word of God. Nobody told you, this week, what to do. Now, if you're ready to surrender right now to Him, just raise up your hands, like this, to the audience. Now, you here on the platform, let's sing it together now, I Surrender All. Everybody, together. All right. I surrender all, Now really mean that!...?...\n\nL-306 Do you really mean it? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Say, \"Amen,\" once more. [\"Amen.\"] Say, \"Lord,\" [\"Lord,\"] \"search me.\" [\"search me.\"] \"Try me.\" [\"Try me.\"] \"And give me an opportunity.\" [\"And give me an opportunity.\"] \"This is all I could do, tonight,\" [\"This is all I could do, tonight,\"] \"is give myself to You.\" [\"is give myself to You.\"] \"You know the hunger of my heart.\" [\"You know the hunger of my heart.\"] \"You know my desire.\" [\"You know my desire.\"] \"Your promise was to fill that desire.\" [\"Your promise was to fill that desire.\"] \"Now I accept it.\" [\"Now I accept it.\"] \"And I surrender to You.\" [\"And I surrender to You.\"] All together.

Box 4951 Naperville, IL 60567 USA Email: thevoice1017@lwbcast.org 65-1125, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 146 min http://www.lwbcast.org/ Works Is Faith Expressed"}, {"id": "65-1126 - Works Is Faith Expressed.txt", "text": "L-1 Thank you. It's good to be here, tonight, again. I didn't know how they ever found out I was going to pray for the sick. Everybody come in to be prayed for. You know, I believe if you follow the leading of the Spirit, it's all right. That's the best, that's a Message that never fails.\n\nL-2 Now, I was setting in the room today, after... a certain minister that's just so dear to my heart (three of them), three of my real good friends, they told me they was coming to go to lunch with me. And I thought, \"Well, that was just fine,\" you know.\n\nL-3 So I--I just eat a little bit of breakfast 'cause I was sure they was going to pay for it, you see, and I... have a good full dinner. So 12:00 come, and 1:00 come, and 2:00 come, nobody there yet. So there was... the police was chasing a criminal, down there in the yard, and so I went down to see that episode. I couldn't find Brother Jack at all. So, I come to find out, the hotel man had give him the wrong number; and he was ringing the wrong door, all the time, where I--I wasn't at. I'll let him pay for me, one again, though, sometime. Him and Brother Tracy, I was sure glad to see them and Brother Brown tonight. That just seems like we ought to go back in Arizona again.\n\nL-4 I can remember coming across the desert the other day. I told my wife, back there, I said, \"Here's where Brother Jack set in the back of his little Chevrolet.\" Brother Brown and him argued all about the--the original creation, whether it was done in six days or whether it was done in six million. That was a good one.\n\nL-5 They get so arguing, they get out and get a handful of rocks, and one get behind one pole, and one another, and throw rocks at one another just as hard as they could. They couldn't settle it that way, say, \"I can out run you.\" Down the road they'd go; Brother Jack, a little short fellow, just as hard as he could twist; and Brother Young with them long legs, you know. I never laughed so much in my life!\n\nL-6 Then, Brother Jack got back in the car and pulled off his shoes. Brother Sharritt had give us a big sack of oranges, and he half cleaned them up before we got to Shreveport.\n\nL-7 You know, them's golden days, though. Yes, sir, they're golden days. I know it sounds joking, funny, but it's the truth. But we... there's something about that, as you get older and begins to linger on your mind. You think of those days that you wished you could live again, that's right, our younger days. And as we get old, they all become pictures. I'm so glad it was pure and holy, and brotherly fellowship, in love. Knowing that we're going to a land where we'll never get old, where... that great Land, yonder, where we'll never, never grow old or never die.\n\nL-8 One of our precious brothers, so dear to us all, he just crossed over in that Land. And everytime I come to this platform, I--I guess I'll think of Brother Lyle. I looked over last night and seen little Judy setting over there, and my heart was just pounding, I was thinking of how she felt. And I know when dad died how... But we only have to go through those schools of sufferings to know how the other fellow feels.\n\nL-9 I believe I'm looking at an old minister friend setting here. I just can't call him. Is that right? You used to pray for the sick here, all the time, years ago? Gerholtzer, that--that German name, I--I never could get it picked up just right. Brother Tracy had met him out there. And I knowed him about ten years, and I said, \"You haven't aged six months in that ten years.\" We are living in a world that must cease someday.\n\nL-10 Now, tonight, I was... Had you real late last night, I'm going to try to not do that tonight. Finish my story; I was thinking about, tonight, preaching on a--a subject of the Rapture, to the church. How the conditions, as I see it in the Scripture, what conditions the Church will have to be in for the Rapture, and what will take place just before the Rapture takes place, and how it will take place. And we all believe in the Rapture, don't we? We believe in It. And then, all at once, Something just said, \"Pray for the sick, tonight.\" And I was just eating dinner with a little Mexican brother there, I went down and picked him up on the street. I guess he's here tonight, he and his wife.\n\nL-11 And then someone come, and give me a testimony. Said, \"If... On the grounds of the church,\" she said, \"there's a 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min man there with... I believe it was about a year ago, that he had come into the line of discernment.\" And I was thinking, tonight, of having just a old-fashioned prayer line, like Brother Jack and Brother...\n\nL-12 Brother Young Brown used to give out the prayer cards for me. And I found him real honest and never catch him selling a card or doing anything wrong, he's real straight. And we have caught them trying to do that, you know. So--so we... Brother Young, he was right on the job all the time, and faithful. And I remember, he used to stand and take up the cards, and bring them through the line. I'd pray for them and we'd go along, just that unadulterated faith those people had, if they could just get near you they'd get healed. And I think there was twenty healings to the one, to what we have now.\n\nL-13 Then, this story come in this afternoon about a man, he's probably here now. That he was in the prayer line, a year ago, somewhere, and--and he had... said, in the discernment was told that he had had the mumps. And the doctors told him, after the mumps fell, that he could never have a girl baby, and he always wanted one. I think he had boys. But in the vision from the Lord, it told him, \"But you're going to have that girl baby.\"\n\nL-14 And he said he's got the little girl here tonight. I don't know the man, might... would--would he be in the audience, or the--the person that I'm speaking of? Somewhere? I don't know, somebody just told me about it, outside. Oh, here's the baby hanging right--right in here, setting right out there. That's fine. That's very fine. What a sweet little fellow. It wasn't so far to walk over everybody to... real cute, little baby, I'd have her come out here and give the testimony. Maybe she will by tomorrow, or some time when we're having our services.\n\nL-15 Now, tomorrow morning is the Business Man's Breakfast. Have you announced it as yet?...?... That's fine.\n\nL-16 And now let's have a little--a little lesson on Divine healing. How many believes in it? Oh, my, going to be a great night, when you have faith like that. People who believe it, that's what it takes. It's for the believers.\n\nL-17 Now, then, I got me a pencil and begin to write down some text and so forth, and the... and then Billy knocked on the door and said, \"Daddy?\" I said, \"Wait just a little while, I haven't got it finished yet.\"\n\nL-18 He said, \"But, Brother Jack's waiting on you.\" So, I--I had to come on. I stuck, didn't have no paper clip, I got one of Meda's \"johnny pins\" or some kind of a pin here that they called a \"bobby pin.\" That's what it was, \"bobby pin,\" just some kind of a pin. And--and I don't know much about them things, you know, and I just seen it laying there. So, now to make a paper clip here, to separate what I was... had some notes for in the morning; separate them, one from the other one.\n\nL-19 And as you get older... it used to be I could just remember them Scriptures and things just so easy. But, you know, kinda hard to do. Do you find that trouble, Brother Jack, yet? That's right, yeah. I told Brother Jack, here not long ago, I said, \"You know, Brother Jack,\" I said, \"I'm getting so I can't remember.\" I said, \"I start to say something, and I have to wait.\" He said, \"Is--is that all the farther along you are?\" And I said, \"Well, isn't that far enough?\"\n\nL-20 He said, \"No.\" Said, \"I ring up somebody on the phone and say 'What'd you want?'\" I thought you was kidding me then, Brother Jack, I found out that's pretty true. Yes, sir. My, how you forget. But let us have all of our deeds done right, because they're in a book, a record that is to be played at the day of the judgment.\n\nL-21 Now, we're like one big family. And I don't suppose we're hooked up tonight, across the country, as I was preaching my message last night. I think it's just maybe the local assembly here. So, last night, I sure appreciate your courtesy of standing... I don't try... I didn't try to take advantage of Brother Jack. But he's always told me, \"Say what you want to.\" And so I just come here... the platform and preached a little doctrine. But... so just a... I believe it's just... some of my denominational brethren.\n\nL-22 I had a dream, the other morning. I don't dream very often, I'm not a dreamer. But I--I dreamed that I seen a man, a young fellow in shackels, he was trying to get out, and I said... Somebody told me, said, \"Those are horrible people, 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min don't have nothing to do with them.\" And I seen this young fellow getting out of his shackels so I just let him alone. I thought, \"I'll just see what he does.\" So he got out, and he was a nice fellow. And I seen others trying to get out. Now, this is only a dream. And I walked over this a-way and I seen a--a brother, Roy Borders, a very good friend of mine, lives in California. Looked like there's something wrong, his eyes was half closed, and great big... maybe cancer or something over his eyes. And I... someone was trying to pull me away from him. I screamed, \"Brother Borders! In the Name of the Lord Jesus, snap out of that!\"\n\nL-23 And he just barely could speak, saying, \"Brother Branham, it'll have to take something more than this. I just can't grasp it, Brother Branham. I just can't grasp it.\" I said, \"O Brother Borders.\" I love him.\n\nL-24 And someone pulled me away, and I looked, and it was a lady standing over here. The... when I was a little boy, I--I used to haul groceries from the grocery store to the peoples. And her name was Mrs. Fenton, she lives in Jeffersonville yet, a personal friend to the wife and I.\n\nL-25 And she said, \"Brother Branham, deliver us from this.\" Said, \"This is a house of hell.\" And said, \"You've been misunderstood.\" And said, \"These... And you--you misunderstood these people, too.\" Said, \"These are fine people, but...\" And I looked over there, and like a great big cellar, or--or big walls, down beneath a great big cave; and great iron bars, eight or ten inches thick. And people, out of their mind, twisted arms and legs, beating their head like that. And she was crying, saying, \"Deliver the people, Brother Branham.\" Said--said, \"Help us, we're in trouble.\" She herself, I know her, she belongs to the... I believe the Church of Christ, or the Christian church, called Church of the Brethren. So she...\n\nL-26 I looked around, and I said, \"I wished I could.\" And go on, looking around; and I... my little, bitty body and--and them great, big iron bars; and those poor people in there. And you couldn't get to them, them iron bars was setting close together. And I looked, and they were beating their head like they were out of their mind.\n\nL-27 And I seen some lights flickering around in there. And I looked up, and there stood the Lord Jesus with a--a--a lights of rainbow around Him. He was looking right straight to me, said, \"Deliver those people.\" And He went away. And I thought, \"Well, how could I deliver them? I--I haven't got strength enough in my arms to break those bars.\" So I said, \"House of hell, give away to the Name of Jesus Christ.\" And all the creaking and popping, and--and the rocks a-rolling, and--and bars a-falling; and people running, screaming, \"Delivered!\" and screaming at the top of their voice, and was all delivered. And I was screaming then, \"Brother Roy Borders, where are you? Where are you? God is delivering His people! Where are you, Brother Borders?\" I've wondered about that. You know, Brother Borders is very scared. You know the prophecy, all... many of you do, you take the tapes and so forth, about the West Coast.\n\nL-28 There's a man setting right here, tonight, that was there when that happened (when we were standing there, on a hunting trip), a minister who was listening in last night. With a blinded eye, he just come up there and he said... introduced himself. He had on colored glasses, up in the mountain. He said, \"Brother Branham,\" said, \"I'm Brother McHughes.\" He said, \"I--I helped sponsor one of your meetings once, in California.\" I said, \"I'm glad to know you, Brother McHughes.\"\n\nL-29 So there was about twenty man standing there. We was out javelina hog hunting. And I said, the day before going up the mountain, I said to Brother Banks Wood... All of you know him, a personal friend. I said, \"Brother Wood,...\" Picked up a rock and threw it up in the air, and it came down. And I said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD, 'Something's fixing to happen.'\" So, he said, \"What is it, Brother Branham?\" I said, \"I don't know, but within twenty-four hours you'll see. Something's fixing to happen. That's a great sign.\"\n\nL-30 And the next day... that was one late afternoon. The next day, about ten o'clock, we were fixing to pull out. 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min Everybody had their javelina hogs, and we were standing there. And Brother Mac Knelly, you know, and all of them, they were dressing them out, and--and Brother Borders and I; and Brother Roy Roberson, a crippled veteran, a very dear, precious friend of mine, and he was standing there. And I looked up, and Brother McHughes said, \"Brother Branham, does the Angel of the Lord ever appear to you when you're on these hunting trips?\" I said, \"Brother McHughes, yes. That's right. But, I come out here to kinda rest.\" He said, \"All right, Brother Branham,\" said, \"I didn't mean to disturb you.\" I said, \"You didn't disturb me.\"\n\nL-31 And I just looked around, and I seen a doctor looking at his eye. Now, I didn't know him, he had on dark glasses, which is awful bright and sunny in Arizona. And I looked at it, and I seen a doctor tell him, say, \"Sir, I been doctoring that eye for years, two years, something like that.\" Said, \"The allergy that you have in your eye, you're going to lose your eye. It's eating back into the sight, and there's no way I can stop it.\"\n\nL-32 And I said, \"What you asked me that for, is because of your eye. Them sunglasses is just because you got a bad eye.\" He said, \"That's right.\" I said, \"Your doctor,\" (described him) \"he told you, a few days ago, that 'You're going to lose that eye because the--the allergy is eating into the sight of the eye.' And he's been doctoring it for a couple years, and he can't stop it.\" He said, \"Brother Branham, that's the truth.\"\n\nL-33 And I started to turn around and look, and I seen a--a woman much older than he, kind of a dark complected. They're originally from somewhere up here in Arkansas. And so she raised up her--her--her skirt and showed her limb to her son, and she said, \"Son, if you see Brother Branham, tell him to pray for my feet.\" And had long tumors hanging between her toes and things.\n\nL-34 I said, \"Your mother's a gray-headed woman, and she raised up her skirt, pulled back her--her stocking and showed you her feet, and said if you saw me to tell you to pray for her.\" And he said, \"Oh, mercy.\" I looked back and I seen him standing there with no glasses on, vision, I said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD, God healed your eye, and heals your mother, too.\"\n\nL-35 About that time, I turned around... Now, there's man setting here, was standing there. I said to Brother Roy Borders... or Brother Roy Roberson, put my hand on his shoulder, for he's a veteran, I said, \"Brother Roy, get under something, right quick, something's fixing to happen.\"\n\nL-36 He said, \"What do you mean, Brother Branham?\" I said, \"Don't talk! Get under something, quick!\" And I turned and picked up a shovel, there by the side of the place, and walked off from them 'cause I knew it would come where I was at.\n\nL-37 Right beside a great canyon, eight or ten times higher than this building, it's a \"box\" canyon; like a fire come down from the Heavens, like a whirlwind, just a few feet above where I was standing. And ripped the rocks right out of the mountain, went out through and cut the tops of the mesquite trees off, for a hundred yards out. Everybody running, and trying to get under trucks and everything else. It went back up again and clapped like a great thunder. Went back up in the skies again, and come down again. And done that three times. And when it was all over, they come over and asked, \"What did it mean?\"\n\nL-38 I said, \"I want to tell you, it was a judgment sign. In a few days, a great earthquake's going to strike on the West. And it won't stop. California, Los Angeles will sink. It's going down. She'll slide right into the ocean.\" And two days after that, the Alaskan earthquake shook Alaska.\n\nL-39 And then, the last meeting I had in California, while speaking, and didn't know nothing happened till I got on the street, It told California, said--said, \"Capernaum, Capernaum, the city that's called by the name of the angels,\" (that's Los Angeles) \"you've exalted yourself into heaven, but you'll be brought down into hell. For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom that's been done in you, it would have been standing till this day.\" [Matthew 11:23] 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min\n\nL-40 Now, the last few days, the great roaring and popping. Then, here come out a paper of science, said, \"It's all honeycombed, it's got to go under.\" They just know it.\n\nL-41 And you watch, the water will come plumb back into the Salton Sea. Los Angeles is doomed for judgment. I tell you before it's happened, that you might know when it does happen. I never spoke that by myself. And I've never had Him to tell me one thing but what happened. And you can bear record of that. That's right. When? I don't know.\n\nL-42 I went out, and they told me what I said. And I listened, went back and searched the Scripture. You know, Jesus said, almost in them same words, about Capernaum; and Sodom and Gomorrah was--was in the bottom of the Dead Sea, I suppose was then. And later, about a hundred years later, Capernaum slid into the sea, and it's in the sea. The same God that put Sodom in the sea for its sins, the same God that put Capernaum in the sea for its sins, the same God will put Los Angeles in the sea for its sins, that city of--of corruption.\n\nL-43 Brother Roy Borders is scared to death. I don't know whether to... what that meant that, or what. I don't know. Let us pray.\n\nL-44 Lord, it's so good to testify to real listeners. We believe You, Lord, help our unbelief. And we realize that we're going right down the road now to the end of the world. Just what time, we don't know. But that secret catching away of the Bride; one of these days, Lord, we'll be--we'll be raptured, caught up with Him. And we're waiting for that day. Prepare our hearts, Lord.\n\nL-45 There's many, look, laying here on these cots and stretchers, man and women who are bound by the enemy. There's people setting out there, perhaps, if You don't touch them, they'll die of a heart attack. Maybe some of them is eaten with cancer.\n\nL-46 And Father, Thou knows the heart of every man. You know whether it's true or not true. And we say these things because that we know what You have done, Your great power has delivered so many. We're witnesses of it, though they try to tell us that \"those things doesn't happen.\" But it does Lord. We are witnesses.\n\nL-47 I pray tonight, Lord, that somehow You'll build faith in these peoples' hearts, that every one of them will be delivered, all these sick and afflicted people. May it be so simple, Lord, just let us, as we try to teach the Word. Let the Holy Spirit take my mistakes, Lord, and correct them in the hearts of the people. And make it a real, real night that the... that He can bed Himself into the heart of each believer here. We set this night for that purpose, Lord. May those who are not saved, above all things, be ready; get ready now, while the doors of Mercy still open. We ask this in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-48 Now we're going to turn to the Scriptures, to start with, and in...\n\nL-49 Someone laid a--a note here on the desk, and said they \"took up an offering\" for me tonight. That wasn't necessary, don't do that. I can't take it back. I remember one time, in Calgary, Canada, they took up an... this offering was taken up. Brother Jack was trying to tell me... My wife setting back there; she, the children had an old two rooms we were living in, she had to put a blanket in the door to keep the--the door shut so the children wouldn't get pneumonia. And she said... He said to me, said, \"Brother Branham, that's not fair to treat her that way.\" So, you remember the case. They took up, I forget how many thousand dollars.\n\nL-50 And I said, \"Oh, take it back, Brother Jack.\" He said, \"Now, how we going to do it?\" So, I bought the place and it's there. So, to the glory and honor of God. We kept it for a couple years, the wife and I, as a gift from the church to people.\n\nL-51 And then I thought, \"That doesn't sound right. I brought nothing into this world, it's certain that I'll take nothing out.\" So I turned around and lotted it, and deeded it back over to the tabernacle. That when I'm finished, well, some other servant of God, if there is a tomorrow, will use it then. See? So, thank you very kindly, friends. God bless you, for it.\n\nL-52 Now, in James, the Book of James, the 2nd chapter. We want to read, beginning at the 21st verse. And now, I just about... A little while to teaching, and then we'll start praying for the sick just as quick as we can, and 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min get just as many people through this prayer line as we possibly can. And let's, too, remember also... I don't want to forget Sister Anna Jean and Brother Don, and them, I think they're over in Thailand somewhere. Aren't they? To where? Bangkok, and--and the mission fields. There's so many things you think about in the daytime, you want to mention before the people. Then when you come here, you--you can't think of it, you're ream right down on that lesson.\n\nL-53 And now, in James here, the 2nd chapter. And we're going to begin with the 21st verse of the 2nd chapter of St. James, and read a--a portion of It. The 21st verse of the 2nd chapter. Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon a... the altar? See thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works... faith was made perfect? And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. [James 2:21-23]\n\nL-54 Now, my subject tonight... And hold your Bibles now, 'cause I got several Scriptures written down here. If we don't get too long, I'll refer to many of them. My subject is: Works Is Faith Expressed. Now, remember: Works Is Faith Expressed. Works show that faith has already took a-hold, see. See? Now, we choose this because we... I believe that it might help us to understand. Now listen real close, and we'll go into it like a Sunday School lesson.\n\nL-55 Here James is expressing in his teaching, from Genesis 22:1-9, what man seen in Abraham. Let's just go back, I've got the Scriptures kinda marked out here. In Genesis, the 22nd chapter, and the lst to the 9th verse. And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abram... Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him... for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. See, He didn't even tell him which one it was. You just go ahead when God speaks, you go on moving. See? And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled an ass, and took two of his young man with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went into the place... which God had told him of... told him. And on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off. And Abraham said unto the young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. [Genesis 22:1-5]\n\nL-56 Now, he had in his mind now, he's going up to kill his son, 'cause God told him to. But look at the Scripture here. ... I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again unto you. (He and the lad.) And Abraham took the wood and the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and the knife; and they both went... them together. And Isaac spake to Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering? And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for the burntoffering: so they went both of them together. And they came to the place which God... told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound his son... Isaac his son, and laid him upon the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing that thou hast not withheld thine son, thy... from me... thy only son from me. (What a work!) [Genesis 22:5-12] 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min\n\nL-57 Now, we find here that James is justifying Abraham by his works.\n\nL-58 But now, in Paul, in Romans, the Book of Romans, the 8th... the 4th chapter, 4:1 to 8. I won't read it all, but just read part of it. And what shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found? For if Abraham was justified... (You remember, we took the word last night, \"justified.\")... by works, he has whereof to glory; but not before God. For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness sake. And to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. [Romans 4:1-8]\n\nL-59 Now--now what Paul is referring to here, is what God seen in Abraham.\n\nL-60 Now let's... if you... if we was not turning too much, we'd go back again to Genesis, the 15th chapter, and the 6th verse; 15:6, I believe is right. We'll begin at the 5th. And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now towards the heavens, and tell the stars, if thou are able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness. [Genesis 15:5-6]\n\nL-61 Now the two man that were talking on faith: Paul justified Abraham by what God saw in Abraham; but James justified Abraham by what man saw in--in Abraham. See, now, James said, \"He's justified by his works.\" [James 2:21-24] Paul said, \"He's justified by faith.\" [Romans 4:1-8]\n\nL-62 But see, Abraham believed God, that's what God saw in him; he believed It. But then when he went to acting as though it was already done, that's what man saw in him. [Romans 4:1-8], [James 2:21-24] And that's the same as it is to us, because our works express what faith we have. But if we're afraid to act on what we believe, then we do not believe It. See, you've got to believe It. [James 2:21-24]\n\nL-63 Abraham's works was expressing his faith he had in God's promise. Now, Abraham, remember, he was ninety years old... a hundred years old, and Sarah was ninety years old. And now they were well stricken in age, past child bearing, had been for many, many years. And they had lived together as husband and wife since they were young, and no children. But yet, God told him when he was seventy-five years old, and Sarah sixty-five, \"You're going to have a baby.\" And he believed God's promise. He believed It. Now, see, he made ready everything for this baby. See, that's what God saw, when he believed God; and man saw what he did to express what he believed. (And that's the same thing that works tonight, the same way it is with us.) It has been revealed to him. See, it had been revealed to him, so he believed it so, and was acting as though it had already took place. [Genesis 18:9-10], [Hebrews 11:11], [Romans 4:1-8]\n\nL-64 Now, let's just stop there, just a minute. Sometimes we misunderstand It. People gets emotion, and they try to work on emotion. That won't work.\n\nL-65 Now, I'm like Brother Gerholtzer here, we're--we're old man, and we've been in the... this a long time, and we've seen the pros and cons, and--and everything. And praying for the sick, around the world, and seeing the--the disappointments of people, and seeing the--the \"Hallelujahs\" from every side. Then, all this, we learn by. Now, when as boys, and we started preaching this, Brother Gerholtzer, like we started to swim. The first thing, you know, it used to be that I'd get out, and I would... Brother Jack, I've had Brother Brown to walk me on the street, night after night, to try to get myself around to myself. I'd stand there, like a little kid, splashing the water, seeing visions, you know. And I'd just stay there till Brother Brown...\n\nL-66 I remember one night, I never will forget it, up in San Jose or somewhere. He come to wake me up, I hadn't slept for several days and I didn't know I was talking to the man, but said that I told him. Started crying, said, \"I'm going home.\" See?\n\nL-67 \"Why,\" he said, \"you can't go home.\" There's a meeting going on down there. 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min I said, \"Well, I'll be ready in a few minutes to go home. See, just beyond, beside myself, almost. See, I was a boy then.\n\nL-68 Like you're learning to swim, you know, you splash the water and go across the pool, and \"huhhh, huhhh, huhhh, I made 'er!\" Now, after you learn to swim, more graceful is the stroke, and it don't \"wear you out\" so much. See, that's it, you learn how to do it; and cut every corner and make it better, and that's more of a ease. See?\n\nL-69 A little boy that never walked, would try to walk down this aisle here, he would fall down a dozen times and be \"wore out\" before he got there. But anyone who knows how to walk, an athlete, would walk right down that aisle and never even notice doing it. Well, he had that to start with, that's what he is now.\n\nL-70 Well, that's the same way with preaching Divine healing or anything else. As you go along, you begin to learn. If you don't learn, there's something wrong. See, you've got to learn, and you've got to learn how to accept God and what it really means.\n\nL-71 We allow it, sometimes say, \"Well, this guy didn't have enough faith, this guy didn't do this and this. There's a reason there for that, there's a reason. Sometime it's unconfessed sin. You could pour a gallon of oil on a person, and scream till you got hoarse, it'll never move that devil. No, sir! You've got to confess that. That's what discernment does, say, \"Go make that right, bring that out.\" [James 5:16]\n\nL-72 But it's so slow doing that, you see. And then--then the rest of them get impatient, and they say, \"Ah, I never got prayed for.\" But we want to find a way now, that... what takes place, the real basic of Divine healing. [James 5:15-16]\n\nL-73 Now, a gift, just like I said last night, \"A gift is wonderful, but you can't base your Eternal destination on gifts.\" You cannot major on a minor, and a--a gift is a minor. And Satan can impersonate any gift God's got, he can make something just exactly like it, see, exactly. Therefore, we got to watch that. [I Corinthians 13:2, 13]\n\nL-74 Like sometimes I express about shouting; I've seen demons shout, see. Speak in tongues, I've seen demons speak in tongues. Sure, he impersonates It. It isn't a genuine, but it impersonates It, you see, makes it look like it's real. And people sometime, who don't know the difference, declare this to be \"real\" when it isn't real.\n\nL-75 And the same thing they do about Divine healing. They think, \"Well, it's a hocus-pocus, or something like that.\" It isn't. It's a genuine, unadulterated faith in what God said to be the Truth. And that anchors! And when it anchors, there's nothing going to move it. It's going to stay there. And therefore, cutting these corners,...\n\nL-76 Now, faith is \"a revelation from God.\" Now, faith is a revelation. There's where I want to stay, there, just a moment. It's a revelation. He has revealed it to you by His grace. It's nothing you did. You didn't work yourself up into faith. You never have faith; it's give to you by the grace of God. And God reveals it to you, therefore faith is a revelation. And the whole Church of God is built upon the revelation. [Romans 1:17]\n\nL-77 A Baptist minister told me, not long ago, he said, \"I just can't accept revelation.\" I said, \"Then you cannot accept the Bible. You cannot accept Christ, because He is the Revelation of God. He's God revealed in flesh.\" Therefore, the whole Church is built upon Divine revelation. [Matthew 16:15-18] Jesus said to (I believe it was Peter)... said, He said, \"Who does man say I the Son of man am?\" He was talking to His disciples. \"And some said You're 'Elias,' and 'Moses,' or 'One of the prophets,' and 'Jeremiah.'\" He said, \"But who do you say?\" He said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" [Matthew 16:13-16] Now, the Roman Catholic church says, \"He was speaking to Peter, 'Upon this rock I'll build my Church.'\" The Protestants said, \"He was building It upon Himself.\"\n\nL-78 Now, they could be right. But, to me, both of them's wrong. It was upon the spiritual revelation of who He was. \"Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, Peter. But My Father, which is in Heaven, has revealed this to you. And upon this rock,\" the revelation of who He is; upon the revelation: He is the Word, and the whole... \"Upon this rock I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell cannot prevail against It.\" It showed the gates of hell would be against It.\n\nL-79 Abel, by faith, revelation, (no Bible written in those days)... by Abel, by faith, offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that which Cain. Which God testified, \"He was righteous.\" How? By faith. How? By revelation! By 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min revelation, Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice, because it was revealed to him that it wasn't fruits of the field, it was the blood. [Hebrews 11:4] That's why some people can believe It, and some can't believe It, some try to make-believe It.\n\nL-80 In a audience of people, where a prayer line comes through, you'll find some... and they were all good people, we'll say. There's some that's trying hard to believe It, trying to work themselves into It. Some just can't do it at all. And others, it's just by grace, it's just given to them. Now, there is the difference. See? That does it. That's the real revelation, because faith is a revelation from God. It must be revealed first.\n\nL-81 Jesus clearly expressed this when He said, \"No man can come to Me except My Father draws him first, or reveals Me to him first.\" You ought to read that. It's St. James... or St. John 6:44 and to 46. They didn't know who He was. They thought He was just an ordinary man. They thought Him just to be, as people does today, some prophet. He was the Prophet, He was an ordinary man, but there was more than that. [John 6:44-46]\n\nL-82 Just like last night, speaking... When you get the book, you're going to see maybe a little confusion there of what I said, \"The two books of Life.\" It's the same Book, but one of them was your natural birth, the other one is your spiritual birth. One leads out to the other one, just like a stalk of wheat. Whenever you talk to me, you talk to me as a living person. But there's a part of me here, is that person, that must perish. That's the Book that the name comes off of. But the Eternal one, the Predestinated one, the Elected one, the name never can come from there because it was always on It. It can never be taken off. You'll notice it in the book, so we save your confusion. You'll find it that way. Because, I think, Brother Vayle, who put the right grammar to it, reminded me of it today. I said, \"That's right.\" [Revelation 21:27], [Philippians 4:3], [Revelation 3:5], [Revelation 13:8], [Revelation 17:8], [Revelation 20:15], [Revelation 22:19]\n\nL-83 The Baptists believe there's two separate books. And in one way it is two separate books, and another way it isn't two separate books. I'm two separate people... I'm body and soul and spirit, three separate people, but I'm... only one makes me as a being. [Revelation 20:12], [Revelation 21:27]\n\nL-84 There's only real one Book of Life. Like there was one germ of--of the wheat that come up through the stalk, and went through the tassel, and out through the husk, and into the wheat; all the way along there, you say, \"Now, that's a wheat laying there.\" It isn't the wheat, it's the stalk, but together it's the wheat. See, it's the wheat because it's all one stalk, but the wheat is what you're talking about, the grain at the end of it. The others was a carrier, it must perish. And that's the one--one place sounds like you can have your name taken off the Lamb's Book of Life, and the other place you can't do it. So, that's what it is. It's all in that great revelation there, which was made known during the time of the Seven Seals. Why is it, how some people can't believe It? [Psalms 69:28], [Revelation 3:5]\n\nL-85 Jesus said that \"No man can come to Me except My Father draws him first. And all that the Father has given Me, will come to Me.\" No man can understand in who He is, or how It is, except it be revealed to you by the revelation of God. And then faith in that, you act accordingly. See? Here we see plainly that God is revealed in Jesus, and only those who were foreordained to see it, will see it. Be sure to read this Scripture, I omitted it then, that St. John 6:44 to 46. I omitted it because I thought maybe we'd have... maybe not enough time to go through, because that clock up there just keeps moving. [John 6:44-46]\n\nL-86 And so we... You notice, \"No man, no man can come except My Father draws him first. And all the Father has given Me, they will come.\" They'll recognize It. No other man can do it, no other person, no matter how good, who you are, It's got to be revealed to you. Then you see who Jesus Christ is. [John 6:44]\n\nL-87 Now, here, predestinated plan is in plain view. Just as other seed, the Word of God is a Seed and must have the ground prepared beforehand. If you sowed seed, just throwed it out there on the ground, it would do no good, the birds would pick it up. You throw it among thistles and thorns, it'll choke it out pretty soon. Jesus' parable said so. So the ground has to be made ready first. So, God, in sovereign grace, prepares the heart first. He prepared you before the foundation of the world, to receive Him in this age. He foreknew you by his foreknowledge, and ordained you to Eternal Life. He knew you, therefore He prepared you. [Ephesians 1:5-11]\n\nL-88 That's the reason you staggered out of these things, and staggered into what you have now. It was God leading you 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min to the place where He had ordained for you to be. It... or if--if--if this ground isn't prepared beforehand, it can't grow. That's the reason the seed of faith, when you're preaching faith, see the discernments of the Lord, and see what takes place, and all the gifts of the Bible working; people working, said, \"Oh, hallelujah, I believe It.\" And come up, and find themselves disappointed. See, the ground has to be foreordained. And you know when It strikes it. [Psalms 37:23]\n\nL-89 Like my little eagle, last night. He knew when he heard that scream of that mother eagle, \"there's a lot difference between that and the cluck of the hen.\" See, because he was an eagle from the egg. Not... he wasn't made an eagle right then, he always was an eagle. And a Christian always was! That's the reason the divorce, when you're divorced, because you were trapped into it, see, by your first parent, Adam and Eve. You become a sinner by nature. You didn't want to be, but now you heard the Gospel, and \"faith cometh by hearing,\" revelation comes by hearing. There is a little something inside of you. [Romans 10:17]\n\nL-90 Another man setting right by you, say, \"Ah, I don't believe that stuff. Nonsense! I don't believe that. Nothing to that!\"\n\nL-91 Like they did on the Day of Pentecost, they laughed and said, \"These men are full of new wine.\" They know it was... It was a great thing to those it was happening to. Why? It was God revealing Himself to the individuals. While others laughed, these were rejoicing. It was an individual revelation, which is faith; faith that's revealed. If it wasn't faith, then it wouldn't even be there. It was faith. [Acts 2:13]\n\nL-92 Just seeds has to have the ground prepared first. \"Therefore, all He foreknew, He called. All He called... All He foreknew, He predestinated.\" If you want to read that, Romans 8:28-34, and also Ephesians 1:1-5. See, all He foreknew, He did call. All He called, He justified. And all He justified, He has already glorified. There's nothing out of order. We think there is, but look in the Scriptures. It's just hitting exactly the way God's Word said it would. We see the Message is rejected, today. Isn't that just what the Scripture said they would do? Sure, all these things are ordained of God. [Ephesians 1:1-5], [Romans 8:28-34]\n\nL-93 Oh, It should make you walk happy. That's the trouble with we today, so much difference than the Christians of old. When the real, true revelation of Jesus Christ being Emmanuel dwelled in the hearts of those man, they were rugged people. But today we're patted by denominations, with, \"Oh, I tell you, they ain't got the Revelation. You come over here.\" You're depending on their revelation. If their revelation isn't according to the Word of God, then it's wrong; mine or anybody else's, that's where the showdown comes. The Word of God tells which is right and wrong!\n\nL-94 Any seed has to have its ground, of course. \"Therefore, all He foreknew...\" See, He already knew what was going to happen. Notice, Jesus said again, about the Seed, \"Some fell on rock, others in mixed ground.\" See, over where there's thorns, thistles, and everything else, It couldn't grow. And others on good ground, good ground, good soil, which had been prepared, already prepared. [Mark 4:3-8]\n\nL-95 All the man out here, he's like as a chicken, he's looking along, trying to find. He hits into this, and he hits into that, but after a while there comes a sudden Scream from Heaven. He recognizes It right quick, \"That's the Word of God!\" See, he knows It because there's something in his heart that's been told to him, revealed to him about It. [John 10:16, 27]\n\nL-96 Notice, the prophet Isaiah said, \"A virgin shall conceive.\" What a strange saying. How a--a man in his right mind could say that? There had never been a virgin conceive. \"A virgin shall conceive!\" Now, he didn't worry about saying It, he just said It. How's she going to do it? And that's not his business! He is just to say what God said He was going to do. God revealed it to him, showed him the vision; revealed it, and it was right. [Isaiah 7:14]\n\nL-97 Just the same God that told me that little baby would be borned by that man who couldn't have the child... have a girl. Like others and things, how it sounds strange when the doctor says, \"It can't happen!\"\n\nL-98 But when God says, \"It's going to happen,\" it depends on what kind of a word that falls in. Remember, the prophet stood up there and His Word went forth.\n\nL-99 Like God, in Genesis 1, He said, \"Let there be light. Let there be this. Let there be that.\" Created man in His Own image, image of God created He them, male and female, and there was nothing on the earth yet. Then, we find out in Genesis 2, here, He made man in His Own image. There was no man to till the soil, after the rest the creation. What 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min was it? It's His Words, He was speaking It. And when He spoke, He said, \"Let there be light.\" There might of not been light for eight hundred years afterward, might not a-been no light, but He said It! And as long as He said It, \"Let there be a palm tree. Let there be an oak tree. Let there be this,\" them seeds was forming down beneath that water. That's right. And in the season, in the time, in its own season, it brought forth! It can't fail; it's God's Word. It just can't fail. It's been expressed. [Genesis 1:3, 7], [Genesis 2:7]\n\nL-100 Now, one day, God talked to man, face to face. But in time of Moses, when the fire was falling, they said, \"Let God... Let Moses speak; not God, we might perish.\" [Exodus 19:19] Therefore, He said, \"I'll not speak to them like that no more. I'll raise them up a prophet.\" That's the way God's system always was.\n\nL-101 Now, here's a prophet standing; now, he's under inspiration; he isn't thinking about his intellectual, \"Now, wait a minute. If I'd say that, well, you know, the people would think I'm insane.\" See, that's his intellectual; there he's listening to Satan, just like Eve did.\n\nL-102 And as long as the doctor says that \"You can't live. You can't get well. You can't do this or that.\" As long as you listen to that, that Seed will never fall in that kind of ground and do any good. It can't. But when something tears all of that away, and It falls in that bedded ground, there's nothing can tear It out.\n\nL-103 Now, no matter how long it takes, It's going to happen. Now, He said, \"A virgin shall conceive.\" Did you know it was eight hundred years before that happened? God foreknew the woman, who she'd be, what her name was, where that Seed would fall into. Do you believe that? Sure, He did! And from a literal womb would come forth this great miracle. God knew about it, He just revealed it to his prophet who was faithful and spoke the Word. Without even thinking about what It was, he just said It. He never tried to reason It out. [Isaiah 7:14], [Matthew 1:23], [Habakkuk 2:3]\n\nL-104 If you try to reason out... What if this man, this woman, or this man setting here, or somebody try to reason, \"And I been crippled all these years. The doctor says, 'There's not a possible chance'\"? Well, there might not be as far as he knowed, and that's true.\n\nL-105 But if something can tear away them weeds, if God by His grace; not the preacher, not nobody else. But God to place into your heart a revelation, that, \"I'm going to be well,\" there isn't nothing going to keep you setting there. There's nothing can hold you there, you're going to be well! But until that does happen, you're going to set right where the doctor says you're going to set; until that happens. It has to be revealed. It's the grace of God that reveals it.\n\nL-106 Now, notice, God knew the woman It would come to. Notice Isaiah, there was no question. Isaiah didn't say, \"Wait a minute, Lord! Wait--wait just a minute! What did You say to me? A virgin's going to conceive? Oh! What? Now wait, Father, there--there--there never was such a thing as that done.\" He didn't hesitate, he just said, \"A virgin shall conceive!\" Right. [Isaiah 7:14]\n\nL-107 Notice Mary: \"Now, now Lord, wait a minute. You know I--I never knowed a man. This is impossible! Nothing like this never happened! Ohhh, oh, no, nothing like this ever happened. How am I going to have this baby? I don't know any man, so it can't happen! Uh, Angel, you're just mistaken. I've got an optical illusion. You know, my church says, 'These days are gone.'\" Nah! It would never have fell in such a place as that. Mary never questioned.\n\nL-108 She said, \"How can it be? I know no man.\" [Luke 1:34] He said, \"The Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee. That's how it's going to happen.\" [Luke 1:35] She said, \"Behold, the handsmaid of the Lord!\" No question! [Luke 1:38]\n\nL-109 See, Isaiah, when God produced the Word by thought (revelation) into the heart of Isaiah, It fell into the right grounds, it was a prophet. That prophet didn't care for any man's wisdom. He didn't care for any man's intellectual. He didn't care about the person of anybody. He was a dedicated channel to God, and God spoke and he spoke. That's all. Whether it hurt, whether it didn't; whether it sounded crazy, whether it didn't sound crazy; didn't make any difference to him. It was God, not the man. [II Peter 1:21]\n\nL-110 And when that Word went forth, now It becomes a Seed, It has to fall somewhere. If God said It, there's bound to be a womb somewhere for It to fall into. Just as He said, \"All things are possible to them that believe. If you say to this 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min mountain, 'Be moved,' and don't doubt in your heart, you can have what you said.\" See, there's got to be somewhere that's right! [Matthew 17:20]\n\nL-111 Notice! Now, we find that Isaiah here spoke It. The virgin Mary, as soon as... The grounds was already broke up. She had been a virgin. She hadn't \"run around.\" The grounds had been already prepared, or predestinated by foreknowledge of God. Even said, \"She was a virgin.\" Right then God knowed what her name would be. Her name was on the Book of Life in Heaven. [Isaiah 7:14]\n\nL-112 Then, It was vindicated. Man then (to man) saw the expression of It by their works, when it was already done. Now we look back and say, \"Sure, It was done,\" 'cause we see the works that was done.\n\nL-113 Noah's works expressed to man, what his faith was in God's promise. Now, God met Noah, and He said, \"Noah, it's going to rain. I'm going to destroy the whole earth with water.\" Now, it never had rained, that's the impossibility. Well, now, Noah got... Said, \"Prepare an ark of the dimensions that I'll tell you about.\" And him being a carpenter, and he went to work and begin to take his foot adze, and everything to cut the boards, and fix it up there with the shittim wood, and put the pitch in it just like He said. And do you imagine what people thought about that man? [Genesis 6:14-17]\n\nL-114 They said, \"That man is actually crazy, because he says, 'It's going to bring water out of the heavens,' and there's no water up there.\" But, you see, Noah didn't think about that. His works was expressing to the people what his faith was and what God said would take place.\n\nL-115 That's the reason the genuine Christian separates himself from everything but the Word of God, no matter what the people think, what anybody else says. He's separated because... He isn't just saying that; if he is, it won't be long till his works will be make known. He'll fall back and slip this a-way, and join this one, this one, start... he'll--he'll show what he is. But if he's a genuine, if the Word of God has bedded into him, then It's going to bring forth Its kind, you'll see that man preparing for that great hour. See, that's the way Noah did. [Numbers 16:9]\n\nL-116 Moses, with a stick in his hand, came to take the people from Pharaoh. Now, could you imagine... Moses, the Bible said that he was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. He was smart, he could teach their intellect things. He was taught all their wisdom. He didn't need to catch up on his education. Now, just think about a man out there in the wilderness, with all that education, and then God appearing to him and said, \"Moses, take this stick in your hand and go down there in Egypt, and bring my children out with this switch you got in your hand. Just lick the whole thing with this switch.\" [Exodus 5:1]\n\nL-117 Now, what if Moses would had said, \"Sir, just a moment, I thought I was talking to an intelligent being, this great 'I AM' that you say you are. Now, how in the world will I ever take this little, old crooked stick I got here in my hand, and take over an army of million of man, armed with spears, fighters? And I'm not a fighter, I'm a shepherd. How can I ever do that?\"\n\nL-118 There was no question! Why? Why? The Ground in his heart! He was a predestinated person. \"Gifts and callings are without repentence.\" God had told Abraham that He would do that, and there was the ground prepared. [Romans 11:29]\n\nL-119 And Moses took this stick and went down there and took that nation out of a nation. When he come with a stick in his hand, and told Pharaoh, \"Let them go!\" Pharaoh seen in Moses the works, that he had faith in what he was going to do, or trying to do. He had faith in the promise of the God that had made the promise, he went down to take it over. No other man would have done that, and no other man could have done it, he was ordained to do it. God, beforehand, had told Abraham that that's just what would happen. And when the time of the promise drew nigh, there was a little boy borned, a fair child. And the parents, Amram and Jochebed, was not afraid of the king's commandment. See, there was something, the grounds was already prepared. [Exodus 8:1, 20-21]\n\nL-120 O God, I hope I'm speaking to ground prepared, tonight! If the Seed can fall in the right place, and it's going to be some-... If it isn't, it won't happen. 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min\n\nL-121 That's the same thing. They say, \"Brother Branham, that kinda takes it away from us.\" If it does, it takes it away from Christianity, too. See, you can impersonate anything. But if the... if it really falls in, the Word of God falls in the right kind of ground, it's going to bring forth its kind. It's got to, because It's a seed.\n\nL-122 Noah... Moses, his works, expressed faith in the promise of the God that he believed. Pharaoh, the man, could see what was. Not... he couldn't see how Moses was going to do it, but he knowed Moses believed what he was talking about or he wouldn't be standing in the palace there with a stick in his hand. Said, \"By this stick, I'll take them out from you.\" An old man, eighty years old, not an athlete; old man, stooped shoulders, and whiskers hanging down to his... probably his waistline; and gray hair, if he had any. And there with that stick in his hand, saying, \"'I'm going to take them out, let the people go,' THUS SAITH THE LORD. And if you don't do it, God's going to judge you.\" Amen! Why? That's... See, it... Was he afraid? Why, just one arrow, one spear, anything else would have ended it. He was fearless! He knowed exactly where he was standing; said, \"God will smite thee, Pharaoh.\" Yes, sir.\n\nL-123 For God told him, \"You will come to this mountain again,\" and he knowed he was going there. [Exodus 3:12] Hallelujah! We know where we're going too, at the end of this journey. God has promised! There's a Land beyond the river. Be fearless in your testimony. Amen. If it's revealed to you, you are fearless. You don't care if the whole world... what they say; you're fearless. When it's revealed to you, \"This is the Truth coming from God,\" then you can't be fearless. If not, you can't be.\n\nL-124 David, with a shepherd's sling, expressed to the whole Israelite army, the faith that he had in their God. Now, there was Goliath on the other side, and he stood out there and made his boasts. Many times bigger than David, he had fingers fourteen inches long. And he was a mammoth, big fellow, the Philistine giant. And here was David, the smallest one, he was even too little to be in the army; too much of a runt, they couldn't use him. So, his brothers was out there in the army. And, then, Goliath was making his boasts. [I Samuel 17:40, 50]\n\nL-125 But David, now remember, it was revealed to David. He thought, \"Here is the armies of the living God, standing in their own land, and there's a boasting uncircumcised Philistine out there.\" We'll call him \"cancer\" tonight, we'll call him \"paralytic.\"\n\nL-126 Why, David was no kind of a match for him, not with any kind of a weapon; he was no match. That man's shoulders was probably ten, twelve foot across; he was probably standing fourteen, fifteen foot high. A spear like a weavers needle, probably twenty foot long, the blade on it maybe four foot across. [I Samuel 17:37]\n\nL-127 And a little David standing there with a little piece of leather, goatskin or sheepskin, with two pieces of string tied to it. But it was revealed to him! Revelation struck him! Amen! He said, \"The God that took me out of the paws of the bear, that took me out of the paws of the lion, how much more will He deliver that uncircumcised Philistine in my hand!\" [I Samuel 17:36]\n\nL-128 His brothers, way more able to do it. Saul, head and shoulders above his army. But, you see, it wasn't revealed to them. Amen. There it is: they believed it could be done, they believed that God could do it, but it wasn't revealed to them; but it was revealed to David. So there's the difference, right there. If it's absolutely revealed to you that God is going to heal you, you're--you're going to get it. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] You're going to get it. I don't care what's wrong with you, what the odds, it may be worse than David and Goliath. But if it's revealed to you... [I Samuel 17:46]\n\nL-129 And notice, when it's revealed, David become fearless. He said, \"Today I'll cut your head off!\" Amen. Quickly! Our God, by grace, in that crucial moment when decision had to be made, that same God that produced the grace in that day, and dropped that seed of faith in that little hunchback-looking boy, seeing in his heart; that same God, in this crucial moment, could take that woman from the wheelchair, that man there, if you can believe it, with all her trouble. When that little grain of faith is revealed to you. And I don't care how long it takes,... [I Samuel 17:45-47]\n\nL-130 Now notice the giant, on the other side, didn't believe it; neither will the cancer. He laughed, he said, \"Am I a dog? You send a kid out here to fight me?\" Said, \"I'll pick you up, on the end of my spear, and let the birds eat your flesh.\" Why, he had all the... all, everything for his side.\n\nL-131 But, you see, that didn't shake David at all. Why? It was revealed to him. He had faith in what he was doing. He 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min knowed he was going to do it. And he did it, is because that it was revealed to him and he knowed where he's standing.\n\nL-132 And if God would just spoke that, right down in your heart tonight, said \"You're not going to be laying in that bed. You're not going to be setting in that chair. You're going to be well,\" there couldn't be anything change your mind in it.\n\nL-133 But until that's happened, every preacher in the world could pray,... I don't say it wouldn't help you; it would, it'd encourage you. But until that faith... See, the healing power is in you. It don't come from the preacher. It comes to you by revelation, by faith. \"Not by power, not by might, but by My Spirit,\" saith the Lord. \"My Spirit, by grace, reveals this to you.\" And there's nothing can take it away. By faith, revelation! Then, David to prove his works,... [Zechariah 4:6]\n\nL-134 Now, some of them said, \"I know you're naughty.\" His brother said, \"You come up here to see the battle. Now, you run back over where them sheep was.\" [I Samuel 17:28]\n\nL-135 He said, \"Let me speak to Saul, the general.\" You see?\n\nL-136 And Saul said, \"Now, son, I admire your courage, but, you see, you're nothing but a youth. And he's a warrior from his youth, you're no match for him.\" [I Samuel 17:33]\n\nL-137 He said, \"I was tending my father's sheep,...\" He could base it on something! Amen. O brother! And the God that saved your soul, can't He heal your body? It's just the same, reveal to you, He's your Healer as He was your Saviour. See? But it's got to be revealed first, that's the difference. He had something to base his faith on. [I Samuel 17:34-36]\n\nL-138 Said, \"Now, this never happened before.\"\n\nL-139 But said, \"The same God that delivered me from the paws of the lion, will deliver me from that uncircumcised Philistine.\" \"How do you know, David?\" \"I believe it.\" \"Why?\" \"It's been revealed to me.\" And he said... [I Samuel 17:37]\n\nL-140 He knowed what he was talking about. Because when the giant said, \"I'm going to feed you to the birds\"; he said \"I'm going to cut your head off.\" There's the difference, see. And he did it!\n\nL-141 Samson, caught out one day (off guard) in a prairie, and here come a thousand Philistines upon him. And he looked down on the ground, and there's where a mule had died, and he picked up the old jaw, jawbone, dry as it could be, and took out after those Philistines, beating them over the head with this old dry jawbone of a mule, and as far as I know, not a tooth ever fell out of it. And them Philistine helmets was probably a inch thick ('cause they beat one another with war clubs in those days), to keep a man from beating them on the head. But he took the jawbone of that mule and beat down a thousand Philistines, and the jawbone never broke. He just kept beating them, like that, as they come up. So, the rest of them took off for the rocks, see, they was getting away from him. Why? He believed it! [Judges 15:15-16]\n\nL-142 Sometime, to show you,... I want to tell you something else. Work on that pulsation, that spare of the moment, like Joshua did, like Mary Magdalene, all those. Just that moment when something is revealed to you, grab it. Hold to it, that spare of the moment.\n\nL-143 Yes, it was revealed to him. He went to meet these thousand Philistines. Now what do you think when those Philistines said, \"Now, look, coming there, that little shrimp; only about four feet and a half tall, to begin with; with seven little curls hanging down his back, like mama's little sissy, see; come along there with a jawbone of a mule. And look at us, what a great army we are! Isn't that ridiculous?\" But what was he doing? He was expressing to those Philistines what had been revealed to him by God. He grabbed the jawbone and took off, because that's what He put in his hand; He put that in his hand, that's what he believed: he could do it! And by doing so, he was expressing to those Philistines what God had put in his heart to do.\n\nL-144 John the Baptist expressed his faith by his works, and when he said \"There stands One among you now.\" Just 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min think of that. St. John, I got the Scripture, St. John 1:26, see. He said... [John 1:26]\n\nL-145 They said, \"You say, 'The Messiah's coming'? Why,\" said, \"man, what's the matter with you? We been looking for Him for four thousand years.\"\n\nL-146 He said, \"He's standing right among you now.\" Hallelujah! So is He tonight! Uh-huh.\n\nL-147 He expressed his faith by his revelation, because it was revealed to him that... he knowed he would baptize the Messiah. He was a man, thirty years old. He knowed he had to be there somewhere; he had never knew who He was, and there He was standing right among them. He said, \"There's One standing among you now, who you know not, and I'm not worthy to loose the latches on his shoes, but He'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost. And He's right among you now.\" He expressed it, his faith, because he knowed, in his day, he was to see and baptize God's Messiah. So, you see, the people could see the expression upon him, in the way he was preaching and the way he was acting, was expressing that he had a true revelation from God. [Matthew 3:11]\n\nL-148 Now, to prove that it was true, walking right out of the crowd come the Messiah; just an ordinary young man walking down through there, dressed like other man. John said, \"Behold, there's the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.\" [John 1:29]\n\nL-149 \"How do you know Him?\"\n\nL-150 He said, \"He that said to me, in the wilderness, 'Upon whom thou shall see the Spirit descending, that's the One that'll baptize with the Holy Ghost.'\" [John 1:32-33]\n\nL-151 See, he knew Him because there was supposed to be a sign about that time. (Are you catching It?) John knew just about the hour, 'cause he was a prophet. It was revealed to him, that he know would be about that time, he'd see a sign. And when he seen that sign, he said, \"He's standing among you.\" He knew It was there. [John 1:26-27]\n\nL-152 Oh, I see the sign that the end time is here. I see the things that's promised, for this end-time Message, coming to pass (unfolding) just exactly like the Scripture said. And I know that the time is at hand! I say that without hesitance. I believe it's right at hand, for I see the signs that He said would happen just before that time. It's ready to happen now.\n\nL-153 John expressed his faith in what God had revealed to him. Therefore, works is faith's testimony. When they see you acting like you're healed, then they'll know you got faith that you are healed.\n\nL-154 What does testimony say? Saying this: \"I have it now, 'cause I received God's promise. It is now working in me. I am making ready for it to happen.\" Uh-huh. See, that's what you testi-... your works does. Well, sure!\n\nL-155 Here, some time ago, next to my last trip in Africa; I was just over there this spring, but trip before that. There was a little baby that had club feet, and one foot... leg shorter than the other one. It never wore shoes in its life. Oh, it was a most horrible deformed. And I prayed for the baby that night, they had watched and seen those things done, they prayed for the baby. And the next morning I went down, walked by a shoe store. And I walked in there, and there was the man buying the baby a pair of shoes to wear. He believed it! Uh-huh.\n\nL-156 Like this man over here, that believed that God would give him the baby. Sure, he believed it was going to happen, made ready for it. \"I'm making ready.\" Although no physical results seen as yet, but that didn't make a bit of difference. He believed it, like Abraham, \"called anything contrary as though it was not so.\" There!\n\nL-157 Therefore, if your intellectuals does tell you... Oh, here's the stinger now. If your intellectuals does tell you that \"This is the Truth, God is the Healer of sickness,\" your mind can witness that \"That is the Truth,\" but if there is not the bedding ground in your heart (faith, to fall in) to express it, it will not happen. Though much... no matter how much this outside man can reason it with the Scriptures, and say, \"it's right,\" that still doesn't make it Right.\n\nL-158 How many takes the tapes? Did you get my sermon, not long ago, The Anointed Ones Of The Last Day? Did you believe that? See, it said, \"There will be antichrists. Antichrists would almost deceive the very elected, if possible.\" Can it through... It can't, because it's impossible, they're elected. See? All right.\n\nL-159 But He said, \"The anointed ones.\" See, Christ means \"anointed,\" but these were anti. They were anointed, but anti, 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min against Christ in their teaching. Now, they could do anything that the rest of them could do. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-160 Now, remember, you're in a cycle of three, but you're one person. Like Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, cycle of three, but one Person. Three attributes of the same God: fatherhood... Three offices like: fatherhood, sonship, and Holy Ghost. And you are: body, spirit, and soul.\n\nL-161 Now, the outside body has five inlets to it, to contact your earthly home: see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. The inside, which is a spirit, it has five senses: conscience, and love, and so forth. But the inside of that, the soul, has one thing. That's where you live.\n\nL-162 The Spirit can come out here and anoint you to do certain thing, and you do it, but that don't mean you're saved. Think of it. Caiaphas prophesied. Judas cast out devils. See, the Spirit anointed him. This rain falls on the just and the unjust, the weeds can rejoice with the wheat. But it's what it is at the core. There's where you can, intellectuals, can accept and say, \"Oh, sure, that looks good. I believe that.\" That still don't do it. No, sir. And the spirit can actually make witness of it, and still it isn't so. Because if that soul hasn't come from God, it can make all the impersonations out here, but it cannot be real. You can act healing, you can act like you have. You can act like you receive it. Christians can act like they're Christians, and act and be ever so good at it, but that don't mean they're saved. That's exactly right, see. The Spirit can be there, the real, genuine Spirit. The Holy Spirit can anoint you, that still don't mean you're saved. It's that inside soul that never dies, it's got Eternal Life. It always was Eternal Life. See? It come from God, it goes to God, it's the soul. [Hebrews 6:7-8]\n\nL-163 Now, notice that, it's got to be. Five, f-a-i-t-h, outside; spirit, J-e-s-u-s; on the inside, y-o-u. See? That's how standing here, looking at you, I don't know a one of you. The spirit can anoint me, still I don't know none of you. But when that inside of the inside breaks in, that's God.\n\nL-164 That's where the outside can reason. You take a man, say, \"Well, you know, I--I know I'm not supposed to commit adultery. But, you know, then the spirit tells me I shouldn't commit adultery. But, you see, way down in there is still that thing in there.\" See, it'll kinda govern around, and better watch it.\n\nL-165 But when it's directed from the inside, it throws all the rest of it together. That's the guidepost. That's the control tower, the inside of the inside. The soul controls the spirit, the spirit controls the body.\n\nL-166 So an outside whitewash don't make any difference. Them religious people back there, that Paul called \"whited-walls,\" and so forth, they were (outward) just every way the... a believer, and they had prophesies among them, and everything else but the inside of the inside (\"the soul that disbelieveth\"). [Acts 23:2-3]\n\nL-167 That's the reason I say people can jump up and down, and speak in tongues, people can shout, lay hands on the sick, and heal the sick and so forth, by faith; all these great things there by the Spirit, still be lost. Anointed ones.\n\nL-168 Notice Jesus has said, \"Only believe, for all things are possible to them that believe.\" Faith and works are husband and wife, they work together. The husband works with the wife, the wife with the husband; they identify one another. [Matthew 19:26], [Mark 9:23], [Mark 10:27]\n\nL-169 Like a man says he's \"married\" and yet he can't produce and show that he has a wife, you doubt his claim. See? A man said, \"I'm married.\" \"Where's your wife?\" \"Oh, oh, I--I don't know about that.\" See? See? Be kinda hard thing for me to believe him. I say, \"Well, where is your wife?\" \"Well, I don't know.\" I--I ain't going to believe it.\n\nL-170 So, you see, if you have what you say you have, \"I have faith.\" How you going to show me you got faith? By your work. See? \"I am married.\" \"How do I know you're married?\" \"This is my wife.\" See? There you are. \"I am married, this is my husband.\" 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min \"I am healed.\" \"How do you know?\"\n\nL-171 \"My works shows my faith.\" See? See? Now, what--what you're speaking of: your faith is what God sees in you, your works is what the other people see in you. [Matthew 21:21-22]\n\nL-172 That's for difference between James and Paul here, explaining about Abraham. They never contradicted one another, they was both the same; married.\n\nL-173 So is faith that doesn't produce works, anyone has a right to doubt your testimony. Now do you hear it, before we start the prayer line? If your faith doesn't produce works with it, you can't make anyone believe that you're healed. Say, \"Well, I don't know.\" See? \"Why, yeah, sure, I got all the faith in the world.\" You don't. Because, if you are... got faith, then works is married to faith. They're husband and wife, one--one identifies the other one. [James 2:21-24], [Romans 4:1-8]\n\nL-174 Let's think of Abraham for just a few minutes. Abraham got that holy union in complete, see, he got the whole thing together. He called things, contrary to his faith, as though it was not; and acted on the same principle. I can imagine, after about twenty years, somebody come by and said, \"Father of nations? Huh! Abram, you said your name was 'Abraham,' which means father of nations. Just how many children do you have right now, Abraham?\" See?\n\nL-175 That didn't stumble him a bit. The Bible said, \"He staggered not at the Word of God, through unbelief.\" He went right ahead making ready, keeping all the booties ready and the bird-eye and everything, he was \"going to have the baby.\" That's all. [Romans 4:20]\n\nL-176 Even Sarah said, \"You know what's going to happen? You're going to have the baby, but I tell you the way we're going to do it. Hagar now is my maid, I'm going to give her to you.\" Cause, polygamy was legal then. \"And she'll have a baby, and I'll take the baby myself.\" But Abraham didn't believe that. Nope, he wouldn't do it. But Sarah was inspired to do it.\n\nL-177 So, God told Abraham, \"Go ahead and listen to her,\" but He said, \"yet this is not what I promised you. This is not the way I promised it.\" [Genesis 16:1-4]\n\nL-178 Now watch, he called anything \"contrary,\" and his body then dead, and Sarah's womb the same. Now, he was an old man, a hundred years old. Sarah was ninety years old. Now notice! The deadness of Sarah's womb or the deadness of his body wasn't even brought under consideration.\n\nL-179 Listen to this. For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. For if it was by the law... was by the law be heir, faith is made void, and the promise is... none effect: Because the law worketh wrath: and where there is no law, there is no transgression. [Romans 4:13-15]\n\nL-180 Listen to this, now. Who against hope... \"Against hope,\" all hopes was gone! Oh, every time I go to feeling a little \"blue,\" here's the chapter I turn to, Romans 4, see. (As it is written, I have made thee a father of... nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and called those things which were not as though they were. (\"God said so!\" See?) Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of... nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. [Romans 4:18]\n\nL-181 Now listen, 19th verse. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither... the deadness of Sarah's womb: He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong... giving glory to God; [Romans 4:19-20] 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min\n\nL-182 At a hundred years old? Look, his body now dead (his manhood), and Sarah's womb dead. He's... It wasn't even considered. When it's revealed to him, that dead is not considered. You're a paralytic, or whatever you are, that isn't considered. The wheelchair's not under consideration. Or the little boy, maybe paralyzed, whatever it is (I don't know), it's not under consideration. Don't even consider it.\n\nL-183 \"But the doctor said, 'He'll never get out of here.' The doctor said, 'She'll never come... '\" That's not even considered. \"Well, look, I'm an old person, I'm getting middle aged.\" I don't even consider it.\n\nL-184 And we are the children of Abraham (Hallelujah!), not as Isaac was, but his Royal Seed (through Jesus Christ) by the faith that he had, Abraham's Seed coming forth in the last days to shine like the stars. Abraham's children! \"Considered not his own body now dead.\" Neither even considered it! It wasn't even brought into question whether God would do it or not, God said he would do it! Why? It was revealed to him. Is that right? [Romans 4:19]\n\nL-185 When it's revealed to you, when it really... something... You can't make it happen, it's got to be revealed to you. Then you don't even consider anything else: how impossible it is, don't consider what the doctor said, you don't consider what mama said, what papa said, what the preacher said, what anybody else said. You just consider what God said!\n\nL-186 \"He considered not his own body now dead, neither the deadness of Sarah's womb. It wasn't even brought under consideration. Oh, my, that just shakes me. Body dead, nor the deadness of Sarah's womb, not even brought under consideration. [Romans 4:19]\n\nL-187 No circumstances will be considered when faith finds its bedding ground! When a germ gene from a man finds the--the egg in the woman, and both of them fertile, something's going to happen. Hallelujah! The doctor can say, \"You'll not have a baby. I can prove that your--your genes are dead in your body, and her eggs will never be fertile.\" But let that fertile egg, let that germ twist itself to that egg one time, watch what happens; that little boy or that little girl comes on the scene. Why? Faith has found its bedding ground. Works goes to work, cell on top of cell, and here comes the little fellow. Amen. God, have mercy upon us. O God, if we was rugged Christians like we should be! If we were man and women, you could take God at His Word. You can't do it until it's revealed to you. (I got to hurry)\n\nL-188 Notice, the holy faith of God was united with the holy works of his prophet. Remember, God's holy faith was revealed to Abraham. He received it, and by there he started with his holy works, by believing. The seed of promise had a place to grow. What if he said (Abraham) \"Well, you know, Sarah, after all, it's been twenty-five years since God made that promise\"? Huh-uh! \"If something would a-happened,\" see. But it wouldn't. God knowed it wouldn't.\n\nL-189 What if the virgin Mary said, \"Well, now, wait a minute! A--a virgin conceive? Well, they'll throw me out of my church if I go in and say such a thing as that\"? Now, she would have thought those thoughts if it hadn't been that prepared bedding ground. When that prophet said, \"A virgin shall conceive,\" that settled it. See?\n\nL-190 \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\" If a bedding ground is laying there when that Word drops there, it takes a-hold. There's nothing can stop it. [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-191 Now, quickly, while we finish. See, the Seed had a place to hide. God knew it, or He would have never give the promise to Abraham. Now listen, real close now. God knowed where that promise was going to; He never even called Abraham till he was seventy-five years old, but he was His predestinated servant from the beginning, so was Sarah.\n\nL-192 Notice, remember, he had no Bible to read from. He didn't have it as easy as we got it today, to read His Word and see others who've took It. Remember, he only had It by revelation, and that's the real thing. Same as it was by Joseph, in Genesis, there was no Bible. Remember, Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. None of those characters in there had any Bible to read till after Moses. Is that right? They didn't have a Bible that we got, to help us along in our cripple condition. They were rugged man who... was revealed to them by God, and they stood right there. Nothing moved them. Now, do you think that we can still have that rugged faith? If It's revealed to you! 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min\n\nL-193 Pardon the expression, or the testimony at this time, just before closing. I remember that up here in \"Twin City,\" I think Brother Brown and them was with me; and I was taking the life of Joseph, in the Bible. And I read that Bible, there was a man there was nothing against! Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all of them, had something against them, but not Joseph. What a man, a perfect man, a perfect type of Christ!\n\nL-194 When I read that, I just got to crying, one day, in my little ol' hotel room. And I went over in the closet where I had my clothes hanging, pulled the door together, and I said, \"God, I want to thank You for a man like Joseph, a man who once lived on the earth, a--a man in flesh like I am, a man that could believe You and take Your Word.\" He was hated of his brothers. He couldn't help being spiritual. He saw a vision. He could interpret dream. All of them hated him for it. He couldn't help that, that's just what he was. [Genesis 37:4-5]\n\nL-195 See, it just wasn't to the others. They ought to have loved him, but instead of that... When he told them, sometimes things against them, \"Oh,\" they say, \"here comes that dreamer.\" See? And they hated him without a cause.\n\nL-196 I said, \"Why did they do that?\" And yet that man never moved, he stayed right there. See? I said, \"Thank You, Lord. O God, thank You for such a man.\" And right then the Holy Spirit revealed to me, said, \"You'll have a son, and you'll call his name 'Joseph.'\" I got up from there and thanked the Lord.\n\nL-197 Becky, setting back there, had just been borned about a... she was about a year old. She was with cesarean, it runs in my wife's family to be cesarean; 'cause they don't unhinge like the woman should, the bones are solid like a man, and she had to be cut from her mother. And the doctor told me, he said, \"Brother Branham, don't you never have another child by this woman.\" Said, \"Her womb is as thin as a balloon.\" He said, \"You'd better let me tie those tubes.\"\n\nL-198 I said, \"No, I wouldn't... don't think about doing that, 'Doc.'\" He said, \"Well, you--you--you'll... She shouldn't have another child.\" Said, \"You're going to ruin her,\" said, \"she'll die.\" Said, \"We had an awful time there,\" said, \"you just... she just did come through.\"\n\nL-199 And then the Lord told me I was \"going to have a son\" and his name would be called \"Joseph.\" I never was scared about it. All of you... many of you remember it.\n\nL-200 I went forth announcing, \"I'm going to have a baby and his name's going to be Joseph.\" How many remembers it? Sure! All around, out over the country, everywhere, telling people, \"Going to have a baby, his name's going to be Joseph.\"\n\nL-201 Just the same as that little boy was raised up, in Finland, from the dead. Brother Jack was right there when it happened. Told you, two or three years before it happened, \"There'd be a little boy,\" how he'd be dressed, where he'd be laying. \"God said so!\" \"How is it going to be?\" \"I don't know! But it was revealed to me that it was going to happen!\"\n\nL-202 It was revealed to me, \"I was going to Arizona, and there I'd meet seven Angels. And they would tell me then what... a Message that I was to preach.\" And that was the Seven Seals. It happened! How many remembers me saying that? The tapes and things will go to that. And it happened! Magazines, everything else, took the picture of It. That Light there in the air, they can't even understand It yet. There it was.\n\nL-203 I remember calling Brother Jack and asking him about that, Christ being standing there, and Brother Jack said, \"That's in His glorified state.\" See? I love Brother Jack. He's one of the best theologians I know of, but I just couldn't hit it just right.\n\nL-204 I was standing there, I said, \"Lord, how is this? Young man here\" I said, \"with hair like wool.\" And He said, \"He is wigged.\" Watch in the book, before it ever happened, I said that. And that day when that happened, it went up. And then you turn that picture sideways, if you've got Look Magazine or Life Magazine. Turn it sideways. There He is, just perfectly, Hoffman's Head of Christ, looking right down where I was standing; there It is in the magazine! How many's ever seen It? Course, you've all seen. There, looking right back, proved exactly the revelation 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min was correct.\n\nL-205 Why wigged? Why, the old English judges, the Jewish judges, used to wear a--a--a wig, they do yet in England; when he's... that's supreme authority, he wears a wig. And that showed Him standing there, wigged by Angels' wings, He is the Alpha and Omega. He is the Supreme Judge, and none other but Him. He is to look upon as Alpha and Omega. And there He was a young man, no more thirty years old, wearing a wig of white. Showing that He was Supreme, God, \"The Father hath committed all judgment unto the hands of the Son.\" Hallelujah! The revelation is never wrong! Speak It anyhow, no matter what it sounds like, goes right with the Word. Now remember, four years later, my wife...\n\nL-206 We knew we was going to have a baby. Everybody said, \"Is this Joseph coming?\" I said, \"I guess it is, I don't know, but I'm going to have Joseph.\" When it was borned, it was Sarah. Then a man called me up, and laughed in my face, he said, \"Say, you know what? You meant Josephine!\" (The man died. The man died.) I said, \"Sir, I said, 'God told me I was \"going to have a son\" and I would \"call his name 'Joseph'\"!'\" There was three people that left a certain denominational church and come to our church, and heard me saying that. When Sarah was borned, they said, \"Why, he's a false prophet.\"\n\nL-207 I said, \"Wait a minute, Lady, I never said when, neither did God say when. He told me, was 'going to have a... ' He was going to... told Abraham, they was 'going to have a Isaac,' but Ishmael was borned in between that time, but it didn't take It away.\" I said, \"God said I'll have this boy and we'll call his name 'Joseph.'\" The doctor said, when he come up, he said, \"Reverend, I'm going to tie those tubes now.\" Said, \"I...\" I said, \"Don't you do it!\" I said... He said, \"Well, you might get married again and have that boy yet.\"\n\nL-208 I said, \"I'm going to have it by her! God said so!\" I couldn't read it out of the Bible but it was wrote on my heart by revelation, by faith; God said so! Didn't want to stagger at the promise of God through unbelief. Some of them said, \"You meant 'Josephine.'\" I said, \"I meant 'Joseph.'\" Doctor said, \"She can't have another baby.\" I said, \"She will have another baby.\" Four years passed, finally she was going to be mother again.\n\nL-209 Then a woman, (a false prophecy sent forth across the country) writing words, said, \"Now Meda's going to die, during this time, because I was sent to lead Bill.\" And it said that \"He won't listen to me 'cause I'm a woman, and God's going to get even with him now by killing his wife.\" I said, \"God sent Jesus Christ to lead me.\" See? And I said, \"I'm led by the Spirit.\"\n\nL-210 Poor little Meda. We had a nurse that had been healed there in a meetings, you all know, Mrs. Morgan, (and one of Mayo's nurses, the worse cases). Well, she's on the record, \"dead,\" about twenty years ago, with cancer, \"sarcoma's cancer,\" in Louisville, right on the Baptist hospital record. She's nursing in--in Jeffersonville, in the hospital, now. She's been there for all these years, 'cause God said \"She'd live.\"\n\nL-211 And, so, Meda loved her, and she said, \"I want Margie come with me, Bill, I don't feel like going to the hospital.\" I said, \"Don't make... We love Margie, but Margie's not our God, Margie's our sister.\" And I took off up to Green's Mill. She'd got me all tore up, course I love her, and I went up to Green's Mill. And I... And she said, \"Bill, do you think I'm going to die?\" And I said, \"I don't know, but the baby is going to be born, anyhow. You're going to have a Joseph.\" She said, \"Is this him?\"\n\nL-212 I said, \"I don't know, Honey. I can't say, but God said we're 'going to have Joseph,' and we're going to have Joseph. I don't care what anything says, we're going to have Joseph. For the same God that's told me all these revelations, told me that, He never failed on others and He won't fail on that.\" 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min I went up to the mill to pray. And started over there, seen that Light hang between two trees, said, \"Go back to you're--were, to the book.\" I went back to this...\n\nL-213 The Bible was... and laying in my car. And when I did, the wind had blowed it over to where Nathan was setting, and David; said, \"Go tell My servant David; I took him from that sheepcote, from feeding those few sheep of his father's, and I made him a great name like the great man.\" (not all the--the greatest name, but just like great man; never made him a Billy Graham, but a... give him a name, you know) Said, \"Well, I done that, but\" said, \"I can't let him build the temple, but his son...\" And just as soon as It said, \"His sons,\" oh, my, there it was.\n\nL-214 I said, \"Joseph?\" That's right. Right there, in the house I went. And there's the little fellow, so big she... she's a big ol' boy, she couldn't hardly walk, going out through the field. I run, throw my arms around her, and I said, \"Honey! Joseph is coming. Joseph is on his road.\"\n\nL-215 Anyone knows, with cesarean, you can't let the baby drop. That night the baby dropped, the water broke, everything else. Next morning, at seven o'clock, we went over to the hospital, the doctor said, \"Oh, mercy, goodness.\" I kissed her good-bye, said, \"Honey, it won't be long, Joseph will be here.\" Went up the steps, she went like that on the operating table. A few minutes, the nurse come back, said, \"Rev. Branham?\" I said, \"Yes, ma'am.\" She said, \"You got a fine, seven pound, three ounce, boy.\"\n\nL-216 I said, \"Joseph, son, welcome.\" Yes, sir! Why? Why? What is it? It wasn't written in the Bible that would happen, but the same God of the Bible that revealed it to Abraham, we didn't consider the deadness of her womb, the impossibility to being that way. You don't stagger at the promise of God through unbelief, but you give praise to God, know that it's got to happen! I don't care what doctor says, everything else will come in all kind of a way, but don't you believe it, it's a lie of the Devil. Yes, sir, true. Faith goes about, together with works, to create the promise. (Let's hurry.) [Romans 4:19-20]\n\nL-217 Just exactly as it said, \"Rahab the harlot,\" James said, \"was justified by works.\" But why? Her faith! She said, \"I hear that God is with you.\" She didn't want to see how Joshua wore his hair, or how he wore his clothes. She said, \"I understand that God's with you.\" That's all was necessary, she made ready. Just as true vision today, (I'm closing just in a moment) true visions from God today, it's a promised Word for the day. Say, \"These visions, Brother Branham, where do you get that?\" People stumble at that. Did not Acts 2:17, said, \"It shall come to pass in the last days that your young man shall see visions, your old man shall dream dreams\"? Isn't that right? That's what the Bible said. [Acts 2:17] All right, now if that's so, also look at Malachi, the 4th chapter, and find out if this isn't promised today. How can you have faith in It? The Bible said so!\n\nL-218 Now you take Luke 17:30 and read it. Jesus said, \"As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man. Just like it was at Sodom. Now, look at the position of the world today: Sodomites. Look at that Billy Graham and Oral Roberts, them two witnesses, down there witnessing to the denominational churches. One to the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian; the other to the Pentecostals. This one, that one, and the other one. [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-219 But remember, Abraham wasn't in Sodom, he was already called out. And there was One stayed and talked to him! And the One stayed and talked to him, showed him a sign. With His back turned, He said Sarah was going to have the baby that he had waited on. Amen. With His back turned. And he called It, \"God, Elohim.\"\n\nL-220 Now, that brings to pass today, because we have faith. And I know this is of God, is because this and other Scriptures point to this hour. Revelation 10, said that \"in the hour of the seventh angel's Message, when he begins to sound forth his Message,\" not in a healing service, but the Message that follows the healing service.\n\nL-221 Jesus went forth and preached; he said, \"He healed the sick, and everything. O that young Rabbi, that prophet, 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min He's a great fellow. We want Him in our church.\" But one day He stood up, said, \"I and My Father are One.\" Oh, my. They didn't want Him no more then. Yeah. Oh! [John 10:30]\n\nL-222 \"Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood!\" He didn't explain It. Said, \"Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, you have no Life in you.\" [John 6:53] Why, I imagine, them doctors and nurses said, \"This fellow's a vampire, trying to get us to drink his blood.\" See, they didn't understand It. He knowed it. But them disciples, they might not have been able to explained it, but they set there and believed It anyhow, amen, for It was revealed to them. Yes, sir. They knowed It, the Scriptures had declared It. It could be asked then to me, this that you might say, \"Why do you have faith to believe in these visions, when--when there's so many false impersonations goes forth?\"\n\nL-223 I'm going to speak a little something, strong, just for a minute now. When so many false impersonations are around, remember, my brother, they are also spoken of that they should be here at this same time. That's exactly, just as it was in the times of Moses. Moses went down to perform the works of God before the people, and there was Jambres and Jannes standing there. But who was first to do it? Then these other ones was impersonators, 'cause there had to be a original first for them to impersonate. If that had been the original... Uh-huh. Nah, we're not--we're not lost, we know where we're at. See? See, by the Scripture and by the revelation of God, that's why you still stand. [II Timothy 3:8]\n\nL-224 \"Why, this man, he sees visions and so forth. He does this, and he run around with this man's wife. He believes in--in three gods, and all these things.\" That don't stagger It a bit. And here's one thing they can't impersonate: the Word! No. They can have all these things, they can speak in tongues, they can shout, dance in the Spirit, and still be devils. Uh-huh. That's right. That's right. But this Word measures them up. See? That's exactly right. This is where it comes to. As Moses, and Jambres... And remember, He said, \"As Jambres and Jannes withstood Moses, in the last days these impersonators would rise on the earth again.\" Did He say it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] So, we got them. [II Timothy 3:8]\n\nL-225 But that didn't stagger Moses. When Moses turned around and done a miracle in the Name of the Lord, and here stood these impersonators, done the same thing. That didn't stop him, say, \"Well, I guess I had better quit and go off the field.\" He stayed right there. For what? It was revealed to him. Hallelujah! He knowed by the Word of God. He knowed that the Word would finally catch up with them. He knowed there'd come a time when the Word would manifest Itself, and they couldn't go no further.\n\nL-226 So have I knowed this, all these years. See? That's right, that the time would come. When any miracle that God sends, a real miracle, there's always a change in the whole system. If God sends something into the church, and the old system's not changed, He sent it in vain. When a message goes forth in signs and wonders, there is a Message follows that. When Jesus went forth healing the sick, then come His Message, \"I and My Father are One. I am He.\" See? See, they--they didn't believe That. They believed His miracles. Said, \"If you can't believe Me, believe those miracles.\" Said, \"They testify to you, who I am.\" Oh, my. Glory! Who was first? Moses! Then they impersonated him. But the great truths still remains the same between the right and wrong, they cannot accept the Message! They cannot accept the Message that's unadulterated, from the Word of God. [John 10:30]\n\nL-227 I don't care, Judas could have done all kind of signs and wonders; but, when he come to receive the Holy Ghost at the Day of Pentecost, he showed his colors. That Devil can come right up and impersonate right to the very thing, till it comes to this Word, but he can't take all that Word. He can bring it all up, maybe to one Word like Eve did, the Devil did to Eve, but he can't cross it all. Because the only... the whole thing is the Body of Christ. See, Word now. Neither could... They could not, cannot take the Message now, neither could Jambres and Jannes take Moses' Message. They could not do it. Their works of impersonation was made known, because they could not be able to follow God's Word vindicated by His anointed prophet. See? [John 17:12], [Hebrews 10:39]\n\nL-228 They could not follow Israel out. Why? They were denominational, Egyptian babies! They could not follow that Word. If they did, they had to leave Egypt. The Nile was good to them, and they couldn't do it. Although they could 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min impersonate the works, and do what Moses did, but their folly was made manifest when it come time to leave. Then God really poured out it, on them.\n\nL-229 Same now! They might do all kind of false impersonations and things, that don't do nothing but magnify the right thing. And any believing child knows that's the Truth (uh-huh). Here you see in plain view, then, the works of their folly of their impersonation. If you'll... if your work is the true Word and vindicated by It, by your faith, it will manifest (and the--and the promise of God) in Its original written Word.\n\nL-230 Jesus said, \"If I do not the works...\" (Listen close!) \"If I do not the works...\" (Let me add this to It.) \"That is, if I do not the works the Scriptures tell you I will do, then... do that in My age, when I come, what the Messiah was supposed to do when He come. If the things that I do, if God doesn't vindicate that Word that He said would happen, if My life doesn't make that Word live just exactly what It said It would do...\" (Don't miss this!) Jesus saying, \"You know what the Messiah's supposed to do. Then, if that Word that's written, and then It don't manifest Itself through Me, then I am not He.\" (Amen!) \"Then the day that I speak of is wrong, what John said about Me was untrue. And then if I'm not that Messiah, if those works that Messiah was supposed to do. He is to be 'the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me,' and you haven't had a prophet for hundreds of years. And if them works that I do, that God promised, if they aren't manifested in my present life, then I am not He. But if the promised Word of this age is vindicated in Me, then I am He and the promise is come to you.\" (Oh, my, don't see how much plainer It could be!) \"If the promise isn't...\" (Oh!) [John 10:37-38]\n\nL-231 \"Then if the promise of that day is manifested in My ministry,\" said Jesus, \"then I am He. So if you can't hardly believe who I am, then look at the works that's promised for this day.\" (Amen!) \"Look at the works that's promised. If them works isn't fulfilled, every one of them in Me, then don't believe Me, because I've told you wrong. If you can't believe Me, just look what the Bible said will happen in this day. If it isn't happening, then it isn't right. If these false things isn't here, and all these other things, and things that's supposed to take place; if it isn't here, then I'm wrong. But if it is,\" Jesus said, \"then I'm He.\" (Amen!) \"I am He that was promised to come.\" (Oh, my, same works that was promised, in His day, vindicated Him to be that Messiah. Don't you believe that?) [John 10:37-38], [John 14:10-12]\n\nL-232 Well, now, brother, if the work of Luke, the 17th chapter and the 30th verse, the promise of Jesus Christ, just before His coming, that the world would turn back to Sodom and the messengers would go out, and the things would be done just exactly; if that isn't taking place, then don't believe me that I've told you the Truth. But if it is taking place, then believe that It's Him, \"In that day the Son of man will be revealed.\" Amen! The Son of man will be revealed in a body of flesh, you people the Church, just exactly like it was before the days of Sodom, a called-out group away from all of them, setting out, believing the promise of God. Glory! [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-233 Then, the works that the Holy Spirit is doing today, by these visions never failing, promises never failing, all the apostolic signs promised in the Bible, of Malachi 4, and, oh, the Revelation 10:7, all of that is being fulfilled; and proved by scientific, every other way. And if I haven't told you the Truth, these things would not happen. But if I have told you the Truth, they bear record that I've told you the Truth. He's still the same, yesterday, today, and forever, and the manifestation of His Spirit is catching away a Bride. Let that faith (revelation) fall into your heart, that \"This is the hour.\" Now let us pray. [Malachi 4:5-6], [Revelation 10:7]\n\nL-234 Dear God, who was manifested in the flesh in the person of Jesus Christ, that raised up from the dead, the third day, according to the Scriptures, and ascended on High, and sent the disciples out to disciple all the world, and said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\"\n\nL-235 God, to the Pentecostal church of this day, the restoration of the gifts; may, Lord, those man, maybe some of them present here, some of them hearing the tape around the world, may they realize that this is the calling out of the Bride, not a Pentecostal message. The Pentecostal message was to restore the gifts back in the Church. But this is the calling forth of the Bride, another Message that was to come just before Sodom was to be burned. Let them understand, dear God. Faith, I believe You, because It's revealed by Your Spirit through the Word of God and has been vindicated and made manifest to the whole world. Certainly, Lord, in the minority, always your groups are that way. But You said, 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min \"Fear not, little flock, it's your Father's good will to give you the Kingdom.\"\n\nL-236 So, I pray, God, that man will look away from their intellect, look away from what they might think is right, and look into the Scripture. And was spoken last night, let the people here think like the queen did in the days of the great destruction of Babylon, she said, \"There is a man among you named 'Daniel,' was in your father's kingdom. The pentecostal father was in his kingdom, and He is a dissolver of all doubt.\"\n\nL-237 And now, Lord, let the Holy Spirit that was in the Pentecostal kingdom, the kingdom that was in Martin Luther's, was John Wesley's, and--and on through to John Smith and Alexander Campbell, and down through the age. He's a dissolver, He dissolved the thoughts. And the--the people in the days of Luther, that man, \"The just should live by faith.\" The Methodist, He dissolved all the doubts, that \"They should--they should be sanctified,\" And in the days of the Pentecost, they spoke in tongues, give the manifestations of the Spirit by Divine healing and so forth, It dissolved all the doubt in the pentecostal's heart. But, O God, they denominate. They went right back out to take man's ideas. Therefore, now when the Bride is being called as You've promised it here in the Scripture, reading It before the world, night after night, and we watch It with our eyes. God, may It dissolve all the doubts in the people's heart. May they flee quickly to the open Son, to be ripened, to be taken into the garner and not be left in the stalk to be burned, but may they go to the garner tonight. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Thank you for your attention. Let God deal with your heart.\n\nL-238 Now, do you... We got prayer cards give out. Now, we're going to take about twenty minutes now, for a prayer line. We want to line up real quick, and come across the platform and pray. And now, I don't know how many cards was give out. I never even asked Billy one thing. I just said, \"Did you give out... Go down there and give out some prayer cards.\" And he come back and picked his mother and I and them up, just a while ago. Now, I--I... did...\n\nL-239 Well, did you start with a hundred, or one, and one to a hundred, or what? [Brother Billy Paul says, \"One to a hundred.\"--Ed.] One to a hundred. All right.\n\nL-240 Let's have prayer card number one. If you got it, hold up your hand so I can see. If you can't... If you can stand up... if you can't, we'll pack you. Prayer card number one, right quick. Who has that? What'd you say? A, number one. (excuse me) A, number... This lady here, do you have that card? Come right here, will you lady? A, number two. Have you got it, someone? Raise your hand quickly. Right here, lady, come. Number three. Got a card? You got a card? You all... Don't have any cards? In this... in... All right, you don't have to have it. Three, four, five. A, one, two, three, four, five. Let's see, there's one, two, three, four, five. A... All right, here they... Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. All right, just line up, just start lining up.\n\nL-241 Now, if you can't come, wave your hand like that so they can pack you. I've asked these people here, that don't have cards... Don't have to have, I'm just a-asking you. Now look, you--you crippled people here, I suppose you had to come early 'cause you just... I told him \"early.\" Now, you don't have to have a card, if you've got that faith like I taught. See, if it's revealed to you, all right. If it isn't revealed, no matter if you be in a dozen prayer lines, it wouldn't help a bit. You know that? Do you believe that? See? I might pray, I do all I could, get down on my knees, and lay hands on you, anoint you with oil, anyway you wanted to, and pray... Until God, by grace, reveals that in your heart, that \"It's over,\" then it's done. You don't even have to be in the line or nowhere, it's done anyhow.\n\nL-242 All right, four... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. All right, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty. Is anybody I've called that's got a card and can't raise up? Raise your hand, got a card and cannot raise up. All right. ... only believe, I can see poor, little, old Anna Jeanne setting, playing that all night, nearly, sometime. I want everybody real quiet and reverent in here. ... only believe; Now, prayer cards one to fifteen, I believe it was. ... only believe, They're getting a little crowded here, so let's--let's just start. What do you say? 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min ... possible...\n\nL-243 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... Now, you're getting too many. That's more than we called. That's all right. Stand still, just where you are. Don't no one... Just... you'll get... you get prayed for, but just... See, just wait till they call your number and then, you know, you don't have too many standing here. If the Lord should do something, you'd blind it off from the people and they can't see it, you see. God bless you. Now let's pray for these handkerchiefs while they're getting ready.\n\nL-244 Dear God, here's handkerchiefs laying here that comes from the sick and afflicted. This faith that we just been talking about, Lord; I remember You saying, in the Bible, in the Book of Jude, \"Earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints.\" And from the body of the saints they took handkerchiefs, not because they were special people, but because they were believing people. They were man of like passion as we are. They said, \"Elijah\" was like that and he \"prayed earnestly that it wouldn't rain.\" And, God, he prayed that so the people would repent. You revealed it to him to pray for them, to pray in that manner to fulfill Your Word. No doubt you showed the prophet a vision. And, Lord, tonight I'm praying for these people to be healed. I'm not Elijah, he was taken into Heaven, but his Life and Spirit still lives on. So we pray, dear God, that You will honor the prayers of Your people. And honor all of us now as we'll pray for these handkerchiefs, that when they're laid on the sick they will recover.\n\nL-245 We realize, Father, that we're a--a dying generation of people. We're heading... faced--faced with Eternity. The world has gone insane. Murders; little girls being cut to pieces and ravished. The people, man wearing their hair like women, women like man, they're just perverting. The race is dying. The world's a-dying. Everything's a-dying. The church is dying.\n\nL-246 O God, bring Life. Bring Life, O God, Life of faith. Reveal to these people, Lord. I can only pray and lay my hands upon them. But You're the One that can heal them, and You alone can heal them. I pray that You will, Father, to each and every one. Grant it, with my hands upon them, and asking with all my heart; in the Name of Jesus Christ, heal these people. Amen.\n\nL-247 Now, is this mike alive, brother? Now can you hear that all right? Everybody hear that? Raise up your hand. Now, someone was on my heart, going to these people here, setting here in this--this chair, cots and stretchers... they \"didn't even get a prayer card.\" See? But, look, brother, see, these people got prayer cards, but that don't mean they're going to be healed. There's people setting out there in the audience, maybe... That--that--that don't mean they're--they're--they're going to be healed. That--that doesn't say that--that they will or will not be healed. That all depends on their faith in God. How many knows that to be true? That's all, just your faith in God. Now, how many knows that that's true? No matter how religious you are, how good or how bad you are, unless the grace of God drops that into your heart, you'll never get well. Now, how many knows that God has done it, has done it all along, great miracles, signs and wonders? And now, you're coming tonight, standing in this line, not because you were chosen to stand in this line by God, that isn't it; you just got a prayer card, just happened to be at your... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]\n\nL-248 Procedure is just exactly like my honorable Brother Gerholtzer here, started his ministry many years ago. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... with faith in God, believing God, believing that God healed the sick by faith. And it never has changed, but God has added in this last day, gifts, gifts that He promised. God did it be-... not because He had to, but because he promised to. And if He promised, then He has to do it; because He has to keep His Word.\n\nL-249 And he promised you the same thing, that is, \"If you could believe that it would happen.\" If you can't believe It, it just won't happen. Now, I can't make you believe, neither can you make yourself believe. God has got to give it to you. It's a gift of God, to believe. Not your faith, God's faith. Your intellectual faith might believe it fine, but unless the faith of God is down in your heart... See, your intellectual faith can accept, to do that. And just keep believing it with all your heart until God does reveal it to you. See? Just keep believing it until God does reveal it. But until He reveals it...\n\nL-250 You say, \"Brother Branham, what'd you say there?\" \"Yes, sir!\" God sent a prophet up to Hezekiah and told him, \"'You're not coming off that bed,' THUS SAITH THE LORD. 'You're going to die there on that bed.'\" That right? 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min\n\nL-251 But that prophet turned... or that king turned his face to the wall, and cried out in bitter tears, and said, \"Lord, I need fifteen more years. I beseech Thee, Lord, to hear me.\" Now, the king was the greatest man in the world, in politics; but, the prophet was, in God's sight. That was God's king; but it was God's prophet. So, God revealed to the prophet to take some... boil some... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] You know? Understand?\n\nL-252 Now, that you might understand now, because I've preached the Scriptures here, \"As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man.\" In the days that the church is being revealed? No! \"In the days that the Son of man is being revealed.\" What is revealed? Made known! That right? Reveal! The day that the Son of man is being revealed, it'll be a day like Sodom and Gomorrah. Is that right?\n\nL-253 Now, look what happened. They had two main messengers, down there in Sodom and Gomorrah, because there was a bunch of lukewarm Christians down there. Is that right? And they had two main messengers (now listen close) down in Sodom and Gomorrah, preaching. But one of them who stood out here with Abraham's group. That right?\n\nL-254 Now look! We have never, in all the history of the church, ever had a universal messenger to the church that his name ended in h-a-m, till now: G-r-a-h-a-m, which is six letters, G-r-a-h-a-m. But Abraham's name was spelled: A-b-r-a-h-a-m, seven letters. See? So the universal church, being the letter of man (six, man-make organization), yet has received their messenger. They've had a Sankey, Moody, Finney, Knox, Calvin, so forth, but never a \"h-a-m.\" Is that right? But they got it, and he's a messenger, sent from God, and he's battering them walls as hard as he can, \"Get out of here! Repent or perish!\"\n\nL-255 But remember, the Elected, predestinated, foreordained covenant, Abraham and his group got a messenger, too. Uh-huh. Watch what He did. He gave them a sign that the time was near for the fire to fall. Now, it's fire now we're looking for, atomic fire, the wrath of God.\n\nL-256 Now, that Messenger did something. He spoke about a women that He had His back turned to, and told her--and told her she was doubting what He was saying, told her her conditions and what was going to happen. Is that right? Did He say that the Son of man would reveal Himself in the same way in that day? Well, do you believe that's the Truth? Well, here stands a woman,...\n\nL-257 And in the invisible union of the Church, the Bride to Christ, that Messenger is here now, which is Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever.\n\nL-258 Now, He only speaks through His prophets. The Bible said so! \"He never does anything but first He makes it known to His prophets,\" Amos 3:7. He always has done it. He never changes His pattern. See? And the prophet can only speak, if He's true, what God tells him. Is that right? That's true. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-259 Now, do you believe He could tell me what's the matter with this woman before I even look at her? Do you believe it? Why, she's suffering with cancer. That's right. It's on her breast. She's got a boy, on her mind, he's suffering with a kind of a mental condition, nervous condition, and complications. That's right. Do you believe that? And that's true, isn't it? Do you believe now that your faith was saying that, has anchored, that you got it, you're going to have it? Then go, and the Lord Jesus will make you well. See? See? Do you believe? With all your heart?\n\nL-260 Now, do you believe, without looking at this woman, the Lord Jesus can tell me what's her trouble? How many believes that? Now, you know... and I've never even... I... only thing, I just seen a skirt. I don't know, couldn't tell whether it was man or woman; but just standing there. I want her to believe. Do you believe, lady? Here, the patient, do you believe? Raise up your hand if you believe. If you believe with all your heart, you can have that baby that you're asking God for. See? See? You believe? You have faith in God? Now, that don't heal, that just identified. That's the works that identifies the faith of the Presence of God, His Word made manifest.\n\nL-261 This woman is wanting a great thing, too. That's not a baby, but she's wanting the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. I tell you what to do. If you'll get rid of them cigarettes, God will give you the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. Go, believe It, see. Do you believe? Have you faith in God?\n\nL-262 This man standing here, is a man I've never seen in my life. I don't know him, but he's suffering with something 65-1126, Works Is Faith Expressed, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 125 min wrong in his chest. He had a fall that did that, not long ago. He isn't from here, he comes from Arkansas. He's a preacher. Go on home and preach the Gospel. See? See? See? I've never seen the man in his face.\n\nL-263 There's a woman standing here, I don't know the woman, never seen her in my life. God knows her. If He can reveal what her trouble is, or something about it, would you believe? All of you? This is only a work identifying the faith that I have to preach what I've told you about, tonight. That's what God revealed, and this is the works proving It. Now, you have to have faith to get well.\n\nL-264 This woman here, I don't--I don't think I know her. Yes, I don't know her but I know somebody she knows, 'cause I see him standing here before me. She's suffering with a headache. Isn't that right, lady? Do you believe that God will heal you? Pearry Green's sister. That's right, and I never seen her in my life. That's right. I seen Pearry Green standing here, looking at me, going like that. That's right. I don't know where Pearry Green's at. Do you believe? How much do you believe? If you can believe, all things are possible. If you can't believe, nothing can happen.\n\nL-265 That little lady with gray hair, setting there looking at me, right here, do you believe God? Do you believe that God can reveal to me what you're thinking about there? Got a tumor on the breast. You believe God can take it off for you? Yes. Have faith and believe. Now, what did she touch?\n\nL-266 The woman that touched the border of His garment, the Bible said... You that want to get the Bible, He said, \"He's a High Priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities.\" Isn't that right? He's that High Priest and He's standing right here, now people are touching Him. [Hebrews 4:15]\n\nL-267 There's a little, thin woman, raised up her hand, setting right here. I never seen her in my life, but she just then touched something. Here's what it was. She's praying to God. She has trouble in her chest, she also has a stomach trouble. God heals you, if you'll believe It. You must believe. \"All things are possible to them that believe.\" [Mark 9:23], [Mark 14:36]\n\nL-268 There's a man setting way back in the back, looking this a-way (about the second row, coming this way), suffering with asthma. Do you believe God will heal you, sir? If you believe It, God will make you well. You can have what you ask for, if you believe It.\n\nL-269 There's a woman setting right here, looking at me, across here, gray-headed. If you believe with all your heart... Do you believe It? All right, that gallbladder trouble will leave you then, if you believe It.\n\nL-270 What do you think about It, laying here on the cot? Do you believe that God can heal you? If God will tell me your trouble, will you believe Him? If you'll believe, that cancer will leave you and you'll get well. Why don't you rise up, and take your bed, and go home? Do you believe? Will all of you believe? Well, now, what about right now? Has God dropped that faith in your heart? Everybody in here, raise your hand. If God's dropped that faith in your heart, let's lay your hands on one another, right down along the line here. Put your hands on... Right now, quickly, while the Holy Spirit is a-moving, put your hands on one another. The man's up, running down the line, praying for others.\n\nL-271 Let's stand to our feet and give God praise, everybody. There's no need of going any farther. Identify Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever; you, what your afflictions are, whatever it is. If you believe Him, stand upon your feet, right now, and believe.\n\nL-272 Almighty God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, send forth Your power and heal this group of people just now, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Glory be to God! God bless you. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

Such an introduction as that, why, I don't know how I'm ever going to live up to that one.\n\nL-2 But just setting there talking, Brother Noel and I, I don't believe I've ever met a person just exactly... We all are made in different molds, but by the same God. Like Brother Jack Moore, he's certainly been... Brother Noel was just saying, \"Since I've been here with him...\" That's his son-in-law, and how he had learned to love him and respect his wisdom and things. And that... I can say \"amen\" to that. The many fine thing... times that we've had together, he and I, and Brother Brown, Brother Boutliere here. Fine man of God that I really love them with all my heart.\n\nL-3 And as I see we're all not getting any younger, well, I just think of the time now that watching us as we change since about twenty years ago crossing the deserts, and so forth together as younger man. But just knowing that there is a Land where we'll never get old. We'll meet there again someday.\n\nL-4 Last night when I was leaving the tabernacle, there was a little lady laying back there on a cot, and she said, \"Brother Branham, years ago...\" I think she had been paralyzed. She said, \"You told me...\" I forget what the woman's remark was now, something like this, I hope that I don't misquote it. Said, \"That this affliction I had would be for a purpose,\" or something, that she would have a baby. And she couldn't understand how that would be done and her in that condition.\n\nL-5 There stood a young, handsome-looking young man, he said, \"I'm the baby that she had.\" Said, \"I'm the baby that she had.\"\n\nL-6 And so many things has happened along the road, we don't even have time here to talk it over. We will on the other side.\n\nL-7 And this Business Man's chapter. I do not belong to any organization, I guess as you all know, but I... This is the only group that I'm connected with, pack a fellowship card, is... They are interdenominational, it's just business man. They have been a great asset to me and to the type of ministry that the Lord our Father has given me. It's... it wasn't exactly that I don't like the organization; it's just a ministry that's given to me, and if I am not loyal to that call, then I'll be a disloyal person to God.\n\nL-8 And, I'm thinking, just before I left Tucson, maybe many of you were there, one day I was in Los Angeles speaking to the chapter. And there was... I had just raked the organization maybe a little--little hard. I--I didn't mean to be that way. If you mean that to be mean, then I'd be a hypocrite. You mustn't do that, no, that's just throw off on someone. But I had talked about a tree that I saw in Brother Sharrit's yard. It had about five different kinds of fruit on it. And I said, \"I never seen a tree like that in my life.\" It was a... it had grapefruit, it had lemons, it had tangerine, tangelo, oranges, everything growing on the same tree. \"Well, I say, I sure don't get that. What kind of a tree is it?\" \"It's a orange tree.\" And I said, \"Well, that grapefruit?\" Said, \"Yeah.\" I--I said, \"How could it?\" Said, \"That's grafted.\" And I said, \"Oh, I see.\"\n\nL-9 He said, \"They're all of a citrus family, and any tree that's of a citrus family be... can be grafted.\" I said, \"I understand.\" Then I started shouting just a little bit, you know, 'cause I am nervous and emotionally. So, he said, \"What's the matter?\" 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min\n\nL-10 And I said, \"Well, I was just thinking of something.\" And I said, \"Now I want to ask you a question.\" I said, \"Now, next year when the blooms come on, there won't be oranges, tangelos, grapefruits, lemons; there'll all be oranges because it's in a orange tree, won't it?\" He said, \"No, no. No, each branch bears of its own.\" Said, \"I see.\"\n\nL-11 So that still was sounding real good, because I'm... you know I'm... course I got a degree out of Hartford and all of these other universities, you know. So--so I'm... watch nature, that's the best university that I've ever found yet, the Creator's university. So as I watch that, I get my sermons from the way I see nature acting.\n\nL-12 And I said, \"Well, that just makes me feel real good.\" He said, \"What's the matter?\" I said, \"I just thought of something.\"\n\nL-13 So, that day, I was preaching on that. And I said, \"Now, you see, when the church first started out, it was... Jesus said...\" I was preaching John 15. \"'I am the Vine, ye are the branches. And every branch that don't bring forth fruit will be cut off, burnt.'\"\n\nL-14 And somebody just down on my neck real hard on that, said, \"You see, I thought if you was actually once filled with the Holy Ghost and saved, you said, 'they couldn't get away from it.'\" \"That's right.\" He said, \"What about that?\"\n\nL-15 I said, \"Now you're talking on a different subject. He's talking about fruit-bearing there, not the Vine; He's talking about fruitbearing, and not the Life. He said, 'Well, just cut the tree back so it will grow, bear fruit.'\" He said...\n\nL-16 And I said, \"Now, see, this tree, when it started out, was all genuine, Bible Christians. Then along come a branch called Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian: lemons and whatmore.\" And I said, \"You see, it thrives on the name of Christianity, but it... It's living off of that Tree, but it's bearing its own denominational kind. See? But\" I said \"if that orange tree ever puts out another limb itself, it'll bear oranges like it did at the beginning.\"\n\nL-17 There happened to be, setting up there, a head of a great... one of our greatest Pentecostal organizations. I don't know how to make it so that everybody will understand that it isn't my idea that--that I'm--I'm against those brethren, sisters; that is wrong. I'm so misunderstood, and I don't know why. See? People think I don't even believe in people going to church. That's a million miles from the Truth. \"We must assemble ourselves together, and that much more as we see the day approaching.\" See? We must come together in unity. We might not...\n\nL-18 If I lived in a city and they had nothing there but a... well, some church (I don't want to call any name), but just any church, if they only believed one thing, that Jesus was Divine, all the rest of it was wrong, I'd go to that church. If I can't get a whole loaf of bread, I--I'll take a slice. See? I'll go listen, worship the, Lord, and show Him that I'm doing my part. I want Him to know I'm alive. I'm--I'm... want everybody to know what side I'm on. I assemble with the Christians, and there worship and--and serve the Lord.\n\nL-19 But it's so hard, I... used to bother me so bad, and then I found out even our Lord was misunderstood in so many things. He'd say anything, and they'd... be misunderstood. I guess it just has to be that way. But those who are wise will understand. See? The Bible said so. They'll catch It.\n\nL-20 So this morning while saying this... And I said, \"Now, they--they live off of the name of Christianity, but they bear the wrong kind of fruit. It has a denominational fruit. They set a thing, and they're living right off of it, and living off the very Life.\"\n\nL-21 It's what I was trying to say last night, that spirit can be baptized into that Spirit and still not be a Christian. See? You're living right off of the same Life, but the fruits you bear tells what you are. See? That's right. See? They can do all the signs, and pray for the sick, and heal the sick, and open eyes, and cast out devils, and--and do all these things, 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min living right off of the same Life that's in there, but still it's a lemon. See? That's right. \"The fruits, you're known,\" Jesus said. And so then we find out... [Matthew 7:15-17], [John 15:1-27]\n\nL-22 And when I got off the platform, this great leader raised up, he said, \"You didn't mean that,\" he said, \"we know that we're all grafted in.\" Well, that is true that we are grafted, stump grafted, that's right; but not in the Vine, grafted. So then he said... begin to kinda--kinda slur me back a little bit.\n\nL-23 And there was a young fellow there, I think it's some movie star's people. His name's Danny Henry, and he was a Baptist boy. Well, he come to the platform to put his arms around me, and he said, \"Brother Branham, I hope this don't sound sacrilegious, but\" said \"I believe that could almost be the 23rd chapter of Revelation.\" And I said, \"Thank you.\"\n\nL-24 And he started to say something else and he started speaking in tongues, a Baptist boy. And when he did, there was a--a woman from here in Louisiana, she was a Frenchman, kind of a big heavyset woman, she wrote down the interpretation.\n\nL-25 Well, then there was another young fellow setting over here was a Frenchman, he wrote down what he said. They compared the notes, and they both was the same. And then a big, light-headed boy standing way back in the back, at Clifton's Cafeteria, come walking forth. He said, \"Let me see those notes.\"\n\nL-26 I went to see what they was, and all three of them was the same for the interpretation. He was the interpreter for the U.N., French interpreter. And it said this: Because thou has chosen this straight and narrow way, the harder way, you've done it at your own choosing. But what a glorious decision you've made, because it's MY WAY. See? And said... and went ahead and said then: This in itself is that which will bring to pass, and make and bring to pass, the tremendous victory in the Love Divine.\n\nL-27 You see, always, even in French, the verb before the adverb there in the--in the--in the interpretation. So in that I couldn't say... Moses, he made his choice, he had to make his choice. We all have to make our choices and do the best that we can. And God... I respect any man's message that he's given about God. I... whatever it is, I respect that with all my heart.\n\nL-28 Now, I see some young Brother come a while ago, Brother Stringer, I think from down in Louisiana... or Mississippi, brought us some pictures here that you seen us watching it. It was of the Angel of the Lord, when It appear. How many's heard the story? I guess every one of you here's heard it. You've had it on tape, and so forth.\n\nL-29 Now, that was told me one morning at ten o'clock, standing in my room in Indiana. Told me I would be at Tucson, be early in the morning, I'd be picking a cocklebur (what we call there, a goat-header) off of my trouser leg. And seven Angels came and bursted this, and ground bursted and everything else, to... rocks rolled out of the mountains, and seven Angels stood there.\n\nL-30 And I said, \"Well...\" I told my wife, and she's somewhere present this morning, \"You get everything ready 'cause no way a man could exist that,\" I said, \"come out of that. I'm going to Tucson, my work is finished here on earth. I'm going home to be with the Lord Jesus.\" \"Well,\" she said, \"are you sure?\" I said, \"Yes. Yeah, no one could--could stand that. There's no way of doing it.\"\n\nL-31 I just preached The Seven Church Ages. That's where I had called our gallant, little Brother Jack Moore to ask him about this, Jesus, in Revelation 1, standing there with white hair and everything.\n\nL-32 I said, \"He was a young Man.\" And that's where the revelation come about that being a wig on, and not Him; He's wigged (and I couldn't understand it), as being Supreme Deity. And the old judges used to in Israel, had to be white-headed. And the white stands for purity. And the English judges till this day, in supreme courts of England, put on a white wig when they come out, because there's no other law above theirs on earth. See? And they're supreme judge. [Revelation 1:8-17] 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min\n\nL-33 And I remember I went there in Arizona and everything, I was trying my best to... scared to death. I went to Phoenix meeting. Remember I preached the sermon, Sirs, What Time Is It? Remember that? I said that I seen that, I said, \"Before it comes to pass, remember, THUS SAITH THE LORD, 'Something's going to happen.'\" You've probably got the tapes in your library of tape now. And there I said, \"You remember now the visions that never fails. 'Something's going to happen.' Remember!\"\n\nL-34 And a few days after that, I was getting nervous, and I thought, \"What this? Am I going to die? If... I hope it's quick so I can get over it. I don't want to linger.\"\n\nL-35 And one morning the Lord said, \"Go up in the top of Sabino Canyon.\"\n\nL-36 And I was up there holding up my hands, praying. I felt something strike my hand. It was a sword. Now, you can just imagine how you'd feel, standing there by yourself and here's a knife in your hand about that long. I pulled it down and looked at it. It was just a knife, one of them... and I'm scared of a knife, anyhow. And it had a--it had a--a metal, something like one of these knifes, like pot metal or something, real sharp and narrow. Had a sheath around it here, where the dueler's used to, to keep from cutting one another's hands, and--and it had a pearl in the handle here. Just fit my hand exactly. Well, I rubbed my face and looked back. Right on that same spot, the other day, I saw a little, white dove come down. I'll tell you about that later on.\n\nL-37 And I was holding that in my hand, I thought, \"That's strange. Now, Lord, I... am I losing my mind? There's no one here. I'm miles from anybody and here is a sword. I had my hand up, and where did it come from?\" And I thought, \"That's the strangest thing. Now looky here, it's a sword; see, hit it, and it was a sword.\" And I said, \"There's nobody here standing here. I'm up on top of these rocks, plumb on top of the mountain.\" And you couldn't even see Tucson from there, it was so far down.\n\nL-38 I thought, \"Now, that's a strange thing. Now, it's got to be in this vicinity somewhere, Somebody that could create and make a sword and put it in my hand.\" And I said, \"It could only be the very God that created a ram for Abraham, could create those squirrels,\" that you've heard. And I said, \"Here is the material, three different kinds of material in it, and I'm holding it in my hand just as real as anything else I could hold in my hand.\"\n\nL-39 And I heard a Voice, said, \"That's the King's Sword!\"\n\nL-40 And I thought, \"Now, where did That come from? Was right along there in them rocks somewhere.\" And I held up my hand like that, and I said, \"A king's sword.\" And I looked around, and the sword was gone. And I said, \"A king's sword.\" That's to... they knight with--with a sword, I think that's right, the army or someway, they knight with it. Then I said, \"Well, that's what that was probably for. It means that maybe I'm to lay hands upon ministers, or something like, that, to make them ministers.\" And then I...\n\nL-41 A Voice spoke back again, said, \"The King's Sword!\" Not a king; the King's Sword! See?\n\nL-42 I thought, \"Now, I'm either beside myself, my mind has slipped, or there's something taking place, there's somebody standing around here by me.\"\n\nL-43 And brethren, these things are true. I don't--I don't know how to tell you, you've always seen it always happen like this. See? See? And it's... I couldn't understand it. So... It's the strangest feeling.\n\nL-44 Just then I thought, \"Now, ever Who that is that's talked to me all my life, since a little, bitty baby boy, is standing right here, and I can't see Him at all.\" I said, \"The King's Sword?\" That would be... God is the King. \"And what is this sword?\"\n\nL-45 \"The Word, It's been placed in your hand.\" Said, \"Don't fear of death, it's your ministry.\"\n\nL-46 Oh, my! Down off that mountain I went; crying, screaming, top of my voice, jumping over rocks. I went down, told my wife, I said, \"I'm not going to die, see, it's--it's--it's my ministry.\" (I told her to get with Billy Paul here, and take the children. I said, \"Now, I don't have anything, but the church will see that you all don't go hungry and things, and I'll--I'll meet you across the border.\") And--and she... I said, \"No, I'm not going to die, it's something about my ministry.\" 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min\n\nL-47 A few days after that I was coming out from a meeting; had a three page telegram, was from over here at Houston, Texas. And that man that criticized me so bad the night that the Angel of the Lord was taken, the picture of It taken there at Houston, he called me up, he said... sent a telegram, the wife said, \"I know, Brother Branham, you're busy. My son, Ted Kipperman's sister's boy, is setting in the death row to die in the chair.\" Said... (what if that was Billy Paul?). He said, \"He and a little girl has got to die.\" And you all read it in the paper, of course. And said, \"Only hope we have is for you come and hold a meeting and get the people together.\"\n\nL-48 And Raymond Huckstra had already wrote me several times, but you know, I had planned there at that meeting to go on a hunting trip with Mr. McAnally and them. And I thought, \"Well, if I let them kids die and don't put my effort forth, I'll never be able to go hunting again.\"\n\nL-49 So I said, \"All right, I'd come.\" I come over to Houston, had the meeting, and course the... they never killed them, they just... they give them life. And that's what they wanted them to do, just give them life. So that's about twenty-one years, I guess, in--in Texas.\n\nL-50 So then, and going back, I went up in the mountain and I went with Brother Fred Sothmann. He's here somewhere. Brother Fred, where you at? Right here. Brother Fred Sothmann, Brother Gene Norman; one day, the second day setting there, the Angel of the Lord came right down into the camp where we was at, and begin to tell about their children and things they were doing.\n\nL-51 I left and went back on the hill. And I had already got my javelina, and I was trying to chase one around to Brother Fred. So I found where they had been eating on the side of a hill, and I said, \"Well, now, I'll tell you what I'll do, Brother Fred.\" I said, \"Now, you go over on that point in the morning.\" We go up there at daylight, climb up over the mountain. \"And go there at daylight, I'll get over on the other side. Now, I won't shoot one, but if they run this way, I'll shoot in front of them and turn them back. And pick out a big one.\"\n\nL-52 \"All right,\" he said.\n\nL-53 So Brother Fred went over there. And Brother Gene Norman (I don't think Brother Gene come, did he?), he was--he was on the other side. Many of you know Gene Norman, a bosom friend of many, fine brother. And he went down a little below. Where, them pigs, they just wasn't there that morning. And I could see Brother Fred, wave at him, he was about a mile away from me. Well, I thought, \"Where could they have went?\" I went down into a great ravine, and come down, I thought, \"I'll see if I can find where they're at.\" Started back up. It was just a little after daylight, the sun was just begin coming up.\n\nL-54 And I went around a great big chasm, oh, my, hundreds and hundreds of feet, just great rocks in the great canyon there, them big walls. And it was kindly getting... the sun was raising up, about seven o'clock, I guess, or something like that. And I set down and I was looking around, I happened to look down on my trouser leg and there was that bull-header, burr. And I said, \"You know, that seems strange. You know, the Angel of the Lord told me I'd be about forty miles northeast of Tucson, I'd be picking a bull-header off of my leg.\" You remember it? Do you? Yes, sir. See? I said, \"That's strange.\" I was holding it.\n\nL-55 And just as I looked up, I seen about twenty hogs about five hundred yards from me, come out eating this little phyllary and laid down. I said, \"Now, if I can just get Brother Fred and get him around to that point there, he'll get his hog right there. But I know he's about a mile or two from me now. So,\" I said, \"if I could cross over this little ridge without them seeing me, up by this little juniper tree there,\" I said, \"if I get around this side, there's a deer trail comes down this side, I can run up there and get out of the way. And hang a little piece of paper here where I know which one of the fingers to go out on, on the canyon, and get Brother Fred there just in time.\"\n\nL-56 I throwed this little bull-header down, forgetting about That. And started across the hill real easy and looked back, they didn't see me, and run down and hit this deer trail. I had a great big black hat on. I started running up through this canyon real fast, and it happened.\n\nL-57 The whole earth shook, everywhere. Rocks that size rolled down, dust flying like that. And I looked, and standing before me stood seven Angels; just exactly the way it was. I felt like I was standing way up off the ground. First, I 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min thought somebody had shot me, you know, with that black hat on; looked like a javelina hog, anyhow, you know they're dark. I thought somebody had shot me, such a... right close. And I--I seen then what it was. Well, as soon as... I got my commission, and the Scripture, \"The Seven Seals which is the seven mysteries.\" See?\n\nL-58 Someone said to me, said, \"Now...\" Oh, he said, \"Well, now, someday the Lord probably (you seeing visions, Brother Branham) will reveal to you what these things are, we can all get closer to God and have more power than we get in speaking in tongues and things.\" I said, \"It can't be that way.\"\n\nL-59 Cause, see, I believe the Word to be the Truth. And the Bible said, \"Whosoever shall add one word or take one Word from It.\" It has to be in this Word. See? It's the mysteries that the people's overlooked. Well, right there is where come my Message of Serpent's Seed and the true Belief of the security of the believer.\n\nL-60 I'm not disgrading my Presbyterian brethren there, and some of you Baptist brethren on the way you have security. I'm not saying this to be different, but you didn't have it just right. See? That's right. See? But, I had it wrong, too. But when an Angel stands from Heaven and tells you, and here it is right in the Scripture, That's true. See? That's right. See, He always speaks exact with the Scripture.\n\nL-61 In there I watched it until that circle went up, started sweeping up, and they turned into like a mystic light, like a fog. Just exactly the way... How many seen the picture of It that was taken in Houston? Remember that? See? Well, that's just the way this was. It turned into the same thing, It kept going higher and higher.\n\nL-62 I was running and running, trying to find Brother Fred and them. After while, about a half hour later, I could see him way down, waving his hands; and Brother Gene coming, waving. They knowed something had happened. And so then I got with them. That's Brother Fred setting right there.\n\nL-63 As it went up, I didn't know that the observatories and things, plumb into Mexico, was taking that picture. Life magazine packed it as It went up. And many of you... Here's Life magazine packing the picture of It. A mysterious thing here, and they said they don't know where it come from; it's too high. It's above all the spheres and everything else to be... It's too high for fog, because it's thirty miles high and twenty-seven miles across after it got up that high. There's not even humidity or nothing up there, you see.\n\nL-64 And they thought of a plane; so they checked all the places, no planes up that day. See, they have to, on account of shaking windows and things. \"There's no planes up.\" Here it is right here in the magazine, will tell you the same thing. And--and it went on and on. And today right in the...\n\nL-65 Here it is in Science magazine, where, they can't understand it, they don't know what It is. Tucson, at the university, a friend of mine went over the other day and was talking to them about it. Said, \"We can't understand what...\" I said, \"Don't say nothing, won't do no good. 'Cast not your pearls before swine.'\" See? It's to the Church, to the Elected, the called-out. See?\n\nL-66 And then each one was coming, saying, \"Brother Branham, I see your picture here. I see this. I...\" You know how it is. But that--that long sweep as this brother has on here where it... Excuse me. [Brother Branham gets the photograph--Ed.] Here's the way It started up, sweeping up. Actually this was on the right hand side. And you all remember I said, \"The noted Angel was the one that talked to me, was on the right hand side,\" even before it happened. You remember? His wings pointed back like that. That's exactly the wings of that Angel as it went up. See, as it... So they started taking the pictures because it was so mysterious. But when the last picture, when It formed Itself into the skies and so forth, this is it as Look here packed it. You see how it rose up just as they begin to see it, you see. And there comes the--the real main and last picture, when it formed.\n\nL-67 They don't know where it come from or where it went, they don't know yet. Science is completely stumped about it, don't know what happened. But we know; \"there shall be signs in the heaven above.\" We know it. See? And He promised these things. See? And the only thing that this was permitted to be taken...\n\nL-68 But I know we're just home folks here this morning. If I ever impress you brethren or sisters as a know-it-all, 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min please forgive me. I don't mean to be that. I'm stand... setting here this morning talking before man who are scholars, man who are smart; I--I'm a illiterate, I can't even pronounce my Scriptures right. I got a chapter to read this morning, I'm... was going to ask one of the brothers here to read it for me, 'cause I can't even pronounce the names in it, First Chronicles 13, (if you will, Brother Jack, you can be hunting it up), for my subject. I--I can't even pronounce those names, I'm letting him do it, 'cause he can pronounce them.\n\nL-69 And I know I'm talking to smart man. But, brethren, these things are done that you might not look at my illiteracy, but believe that I'm telling you the Truth. It's God telling you the Truth. That's the Truth. See?\n\nL-70 Now, and when I speak of denominations, I'm not meaning for you to be so cruel and... No, I don't mean for you not to go to your church. Go to your church, what you're supposed to do. But just don't join up with them organizations, because one day I'll be telling you and prove it by the Scripture, it is the mark of the beast. And you just remember, it's the mark.\n\nL-71 I'm preaching... I wouldn't preach it in Brother Jack's church, he'd tell me, \"Go ahead and do it\"; but I'm going to the tabernacle, it'll be about four hours long. And my subject is, \"The beast at the beginning and the beast at the end, through the trail of a serpent.\" See? Takes about four hours. I got my Scriptures all laying out. The beast from the beginning, he was the beast at the Garden of Eden, he's the beast at the end, and show that he's a religious person and a denomination (that made the denomination); and come right through the trail of it, and prove it to you by the Scriptures that it is. I didn't know that till the Holy Spirit give it to me the other day up there.\n\nL-72 Now, in this, I was watching this one day, standing, and something said to me... looking at it, and I thought... Brother Hickerson, one of my trustees... or deacons at the church at Jeffersonville... If I don't believe in going to church, why do I have churches? We had them all across the country, hooked up the other night, every two hundred square miles had one of my churches.\n\nL-73 Now, this--this picture, I was standing, looking at it, and something... I was standing in my room. Something said, \"Turn it to the right.\" I listened.\n\nL-74 I know that sounds like somebody's a little mentally upset, but, you see, as I said the other night, all these great things are so scholarly... Now, I'm not against that. Remember, we have to have... Send your children to school and get education and so forth, but I'll tell you right now, it won't do them no good in the world that is to come, 'cause there'll be another civilization. All this... so far above this. That civilization won't even have any... it won't have any schools in it, it won't have any death in it, won't be any sin in it. This has all that; no matter how much civilized we get, more and more death is added all the time. See? That one will be without death. But now we have to have school, we have to wear clothes, we...\n\nL-75 I was going to speak this morning on Satan's Eden (many of you's got the tape of it), Satan's Eden. He has made another garden of Eden, and six thousand years it's taken him to make it, just like God did His at the beginning. God made His Eden, and Satan corrupted it. Now Satan's made his own Eden, and God's going to destroy it (that's right) and put His own. [Genesis 2:8-25] Something said to me, \"Turn it right.\" I thought, \"I think I'm looking at it right.\" Said, \"Turn it right.\" See?\n\nL-76 I thought, \"Maybe that Voice means turn it to the right.\" And when I did, you see what it is: Hofmann's Head of Christ, at thirty-three. Here, look in here, see His black beard, His face, His eyes, His nose, and everything else. See the part in His hair here coming up. And He's wigged with that white Angel wig to show that the Message of Him being God is the Truth. He is the Supreme Judge of the universe, Supreme Judge of Heaven and earth. He is God, and nothing else but God. He is God expressed in human form called the Son of God, which the Son was the mask. And if that don't make our Message exactly right: identified by the Scripture, identified in service, identified by His Presence, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Therefore those Seven Seals are the Truth, brethren. Might disagree with them, but just set down and study with a open heart one time, just let the Holy Spirit lead you from... [Revelation 1:8-17] 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min\n\nL-77 Here, when Brother Jack... I called him before preaching this and talked to him one time about \"What was this white wig?\"\n\nL-78 He said, \"Well, Brother Branham, I declare it to be that it was in... was after His resurrection in His glorified body.\" I was talking to Brother Jack. And there's... I don't know of anybody in the world that I'd rely on anymore of their teachings on theology and things as I would like Brother Jack Moore and Brother Vayle, and such man as--as that, real theologians that's read all kinds of books and different angles from everything. Well, but, you see, even with that, and my bosom friend, I--I--I just couldn't receive it, there was something there just wouldn't take it.\n\nL-79 And then when it come, this, then I see what it is. Here's His dark beard. You see It, I guess. See? His dark beard and dark hair, His eyes, nose, everything, just perfectly, and even the part in His hair coming over on this side. He is God! See? And He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And this is Look magazine... or Life magazine. I think this is the... I forget what issue it is now; oh, May the seventeenth, 1963. That's when it come out, if anybody wants the magazine. It's the same picture that's got Rockefeller and his--his wife on the back of it. And this is the new Science magazine that \"it's still a mystery.\" [Revelation 1:8-17]\n\nL-80 What did I say these things for? That it might give you a little view of the things that we're trying to say, that God is identifying both in heavens and in earth to be right, these discernments, visions. We have plenty of impersonations, we always. But remember, before there can be a bogus dollar, there has to be a real dollar first; first has to be a real dollar, and then they're made off of that. Just like we had a real Moses and a real Aaron, then we had a Jambres and Jannes after them. You see how it all comes? They see it and then they try to impersonate that, when there's truly one original. That's right. Not saying that to harm or to degrade, or misplace something, but just for Truth; to know that I... [II Timothy 3:8]\n\nL-81 I'm getting to be an old man, and I know my time ain't too long. If Jesus, tarries, I may... could stay a little while; but I know that someday this heart's going to make its last beat, and I'm entering into a great, dark chamber there called death. But when that comes, I don't want anything to have to look back for, to try to repent for. I want, when I come to that time, to be clean and pure by the grace of God. I want to wrap myself in the robes of His righteousness, when I enter there, with this one thing in my mind: I know Him in the power of His resurrection; and when He calls, I'll come out from among the dead and live with Him forever. And it's my purpose here now to try to get every man... not to change your theologies or nothing, but to increase your faith in God's promise of this day. Now let us pray:\n\nL-82 Dear God, we are a grateful people this morning, but yet, Lord, we're living in a dark world that... There isn't a one of us here this morning, Father, but what feels that we--we want a closer walk with You, we want that--that touch of You in our lives that can tender us and make us flexible so that You can change us at anytime, mold us into sons and daughters of God. That--that's our purpose here, Father, that's--that's my only objective that I have is to try to--to live before You and to get Your Word and speak It back to the man and women that... not to be a different person but to try to honor Him who's give me Life. Grant it, Lord.\n\nL-83 May there not be a person here today... Or--or if... We're hooked up this morning, across the nation, again. May there not be a person that's in the sound of our voice ever have to go into that great chamber not knowing You in the power of Your resurrection. If there be sinners somewhere across the country, that... or in this building, this great auditorium, setting here this morning. If there are those who don't know You, may this be the day that their conscience will be shook, woke up, and they'll realize that they don't know what minute that we may be called or summoned to answer for our lives, on High. And if our name is still on that stalk book, doomed we'll be; but if it's in the Lamb's Book of Life, the real Life, then we are saved.\n\nL-84 And may, Lord, as that Life travels from the blade into the pollen, into the shuck, then to the grain, while they're passing through this morning if there be some Life that goes into the grain that's laying back in that stalk, bring it out today, Lord, may it follow the moving of the grain, for we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-85 Sorry to take so much time. I forgot about this even being on the radio time out there, the phone time. 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min\n\nL-86 Now let us turn for our reading. And Brother Jack, have you got your Bible there? While I'm finding my Scripture, I'll ask Brother Jack to read this Scripture because I cannot pronounce these names right. All right, in First Chronicles 13!...?... [Brother Jack Moore reads First Chronicles, the 13th Chapter: And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader. And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us: And let us bring again the Ark of our God to us: for we--we enquired not at it in the days of Saul. And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it. And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave--drave the cart. And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. And when they came to the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, and because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before the Lord. And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place was called Perez-uzza to this day. And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me? So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed--Obed-edom in the house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.--Ed.] [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-87 Thank you, Brother Moore, for the reading of the Scripture for me. Now, sorry I couldn't read that myself, but I--I couldn't do it.\n\nL-88 Now I want you to turn with me to Mark 7:7, and we'll read the first seven verses of St. Mark the 7th chapter. Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem. And when he saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashed hands, they found fault. But the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they'd washed their hands... eat oft not, holding--holding the traditions of the elders. And when they came forth from the market, except they'd washed, they eat not. And many other things were--were they... which they have received of the... received to hold,... the washing of the cups, and of pots, and brass vessels, and of tables. Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hand? He answered and said unto them, Well has Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrine the commandments of man. [Mark 7:1-7] 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min Let us pray.\n\nL-89 Dear God, honor Your Word now, and may It accomplish that which It is purposed for. Use us as instruments to speak It, and our ears to hear It from You, and our hearts to receive It. We ask in Jesus' Name, for the glory of God. Amen.\n\nL-90 Now, my subject for a few moments is this... I... We are on the national telephone hookup this morning. And I understand that my good friend, Roy Borders, is listening in, pretty well tore up about last night. I'd forgot that we were on the radio... or this hookup last night. Roy, wherever you are, if you're over in San Jose in the church there, or either down to Brother McHughes' church, or wherever you are, don't fear, my brother, everything will be all right. Set still, you just... He'll make it known to me, Roy; don't worry, son, have faith in God.\n\nL-91 My subject this morning is: Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will. Now, that's a strange text, and I trust that the Lord will reveal this to us now. Remember, \"Trying to do God a service without it being the will of God.\" Now, that seems very strange. But, in this, maybe God can help us.\n\nL-92 Another thing I'd like to say this morning, that we're glad to have in our midst a friend of mine, a very dear friend, a young fellow. Many of you people on the radio now can... or the... on the telephone hookup, knows who this is. Today is his birthday, ninety-three years old, Brother Bill Dauch setting here before me, ninety-three years old.\n\nL-93 Several years ago the doctor said, \"He cannot live.\" I just noticed him setting here now. Under oxygen tent, and his lovely wife called me and said, \"Brother Branham, if you expect to see your old friend, Bill, alive, you better come at once.\"\n\nL-94 And I... One of my tires was cut on the side, my wheel had been knocked out, and I tore a tire off of my car trying to get to him. I was just coming from a--a--a station, filling station, and coming from the restroom where I had stopped in Ohio trying to get to him, and walking out I saw a vision. And there stood Brother Dauch, standing in the church with his hand out; it changed, and I seen you coming down the street and shook my hand. Said, \"Go tell him, 'THUS SAITH THE LORD.'\"\n\nL-95 He was about ninety years old then. He had a heart attack with a heart block, and a complete heart failure. Very shrewd doctor. The man is not... he don't want... No, I won't say that. He's just a man who can afford... get any doctor he'd want. He had a very fine Jewish doctor who met me in the hall and said, \"There's not a chance for him to live.\"\n\nL-96 And I went in and slipped my hand under the oxygen tent, I said, \"Bill, can you hear me?\" He nodded his head. I said, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD, 'You're not going to die now.'\"\n\nL-97 A week from then, when I got in the pulpit to preach my Message, here come Brother Dauch walking up through the building. And when I went over to Furr's Restaurant, across... I mean the Blue Boar, across in Louisville, here he was getting out of the car, coming down the street, holding his hand out; just exactly according to the Word of the Lord. And that's three or four years ago; and here he sets all the way down here, in Shreveport (crosses the nation, not by plane now, by car) uh-huh, setting here this morning. \"Happy birthday, Brother Dauch.\" That's from all across the nation, from everywhere. \"God bless you!\"\n\nL-98 I baptized him, after being a trinitarian, I baptized him when he... was one of my first meetings, when Brother Banks Wood had to let him have his clothes (he's a good-size man, as you see), and he went into the pool and I baptized him at about eighty-five or ninety years old, in the Name of the Lord Jesus. He said he never could feel right until he found that security of something. Then he received a birth-day where he'll never grow old. That's right, that great Land. He even is expecting to live to see the Coming of the Lord; it can be done. But if he would sleep, he... and we are awake at that time, he'll come first. Right. So, Brother Dauch, there's no way now to miss it. You're exactly on the line. Stay there, my brother, and God bless you. And I thank the Lord for a good man like that, and for giving him all of these years.\n\nL-99 In the Book of the Chronicles, \"Trying to do God a service without it being His will.\" God is sovereign, first, we want to understand that. The people today are wondering why we can't have a revival. Do you believe God's sovereign? 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min See, the Bible speaks this way.\n\nL-100 And we try... As I was discussing with a group of my fine brothers, Baptist brethren, not long ago, and they said, \"Brother Branham, we can only have a revival when we take the Word, word by word, page by page, letter by letter.\"\n\nL-101 And I said, \"I believe too, page by page.\" He said... I said, \"They've been trying to do that all along.\" He said, \"But we must find the Greek interpretation of the Word, what the Greek says.\"\n\nL-102 I said, \"I haven't read too much, but reading the history of the church, and the Nicaea Council, and the pre-Nicaea Council, and Nicaea fathers, so forth, they were arguing back there about the Greek. That's two thousand years ago. One said, 'It means this,' and one says, 'It means that. The Greek word means this.'\"\n\nL-103 Just like our language; the word see. Use the word see, you could mean \"a body of water, I understand,\" or many things. Bored, \"to be boring a hole, make a walk,\" or--or \"you bored me,\" or \"you paid my board,\" or it could mean any... many things. And those little vowels, and so forth, just change the whole meaning. So you'll never do it like that. God wrote It like that, because...\n\nL-104 And all of the Word is inspired, and He said that, \"I thank Thee, Father, that Thou has hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent, and will reveal\" (amen) \"to babes such as will learn.\" It's a revelation of Him, as I said last evening, \"Will reveal It to babes.\" [II Timothy 3:16], [Matthew 11:25], [Luke 10:21], [Psalms 8:2], [I Corinthians 1:19-21, 27-31]\n\nL-105 I said, \"It won't work, sir.\" I said, \"A revival will never come until God, the sovereign God, sends it; and then He might take up a little nitwit that can't even sign his name, and do it with it, that knows not even good English let alone the Greek.\"\n\nL-106 That's what He done in the time when Peter preached at Pentecost, you know, he couldn't even sign his name, ignorant and unlearned. But God does things in such strange way to our intellectual thinking. That makes it God. If He'd got a bunch of theologians and dignitaries, and so forth, they'd said, \"That smart Caiaphas, you see, he had it just right.\" But God went down and got fishermen that couldn't even sign their name, and that's what He took. That's God, He takes something that's nothing and makes something out of it to His Own honor. He took a chaos and made a Eden. Uh-huh, it's God. [Acts 4:13], [Matthew 11:25], [I Corinthians 1:27]\n\nL-107 Now, if there's anybody got the mechanics for a revival, is our noble brother, Billy Graham. But the mechanics is all right, but the mechanics won't move it, it takes the dynamics to move it. You can build an automobile, put fine seats in it, make fine pistons and--and prove by science what it can do; but unless the dynamics is there, she's just a dead piece of goods. So, in the Welsh revival, one of our late revivals before our Pentecostal, no one knowed what started the revival, just a bunch of people.\n\nL-108 Now, when we get all... our friend, Billy Graham, will get all of the Presbyterians, and Lutherans, and Pentecostals, and everything together, go into the city and there they'll have a great gathering together of thousands, and thirty thousand will come (in two weeks) and give their hearts to Christ; go back another two weeks and you ain't got a one. See, that's the mechanics. But let God in His sovereign grace just speak to some little nitwit, as so to say, a little nobody; let His Spirit fall into a city and man can't go to work, women can't wash dishes, the maid can't make the bed, a-screaming and crying with their hands up in the air. That's revival, that's in the will of God.\n\nL-109 It was said that some noblemen from the church went over to the Wales to understand, or figure out what all the mechanics was in the revival, during the Welsh revival. And when they got off the ship with their tall hats on, and their round collars; see him come down the street, a little policeman, swinging his club around and around like that, whistling; they said, \"My good man, could you tell me where the Welsh revival is?\"\n\nL-110 He said, \"Yes, my brethren, you're standing in the middle of it!\" Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. He said, \"You understand, I am the Welsh revival,\" said, \"because the Welsh revival's in me.\"\n\nL-111 That's sovereign! That's what God does, and He alone has a right to send a revival. Not get the mechanics 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min together, it's pray for God to send the dynamic--dynamic.\n\nL-112 He only reveals His Word in the predestinated. Now, when I use the word predestinate... Now, it's a bad word to use in public, especially when we have mixed crowds between the Arminians and the Calvinists. And not a... I've asked you not to think I know It all, but they're both wrong according to the Scripture. Grace is what God did for me, works is what I do for Him. See? Then you've got It. If you climb out on either one of the limbs, you'll sure find yourself out on the end of the limb and can't get back. The Book of Ephesians pulls it together, I think.\n\nL-113 Now, but the word, when I use it, predestinated, don't think that I'm... that's the only word I know how to--to make... It's God's foreknowledge, see, that He knowed. He--He can't say... He--He died that all might be saved, He did, but by His foreknowledge He knowed who would and who would not. See? That's what He knows, I don't know it and you don't know it, so we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. [I Peter 1:3]\n\nL-114 Now, but God has His Word set, and has in all ages. His foreknowledge has caused Him to set in the church, and in the people, certain things that He did from the beginning. And then the Gospel that's being preached to that age is only revealed to that certain people, the rest of them don't see It. See? \"Thank Thee, Father Thou has, hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent, and reveal It to babes such as would learn.\" See, that's predestination. Not that He did it by, you say, \"I'll choose you, and don't choose you.\" By His foreknowledge, He knowed what you would do. [Matthew 11:25], [Luke 10:21], [I Corinthians 1:19-21, 27-31]\n\nL-115 By Him being infinite... Do you believe He's infinite? If He isn't, He can't be God. Then, you think, being infinite: He knew every flea that would ever be on the earth, how many times them fleas would bat their eyes, how much tallow was in each flea, every blade of grass it would ever set on; that's infinite. We are finite, we stumble in darkness. God likened us to sheep, and we must have a leader. And that leader's not man, that leader is the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Christ among us. \"A little while and the world seeth Me no more.\" His physical being was raised up to the Throne of God, where the Spirit was on the Throne; now Christ is on the Throne, Jesus. \"A little while and the world seeth Me no more, yet ye shall see Me, for I'll be with you to the end of the world, even in you.\" The, Throne of God, of Christ, is erected into your heart; and He's setting on God's Throne, but in the Millennium He sets on His Own Throne; which, He swore that He'd raise up this Man, His Son, David's Son, to set on His Throne. [John 14:19]\n\nL-116 Now, He reveals these things by His foreknowledge to those who He has ordained to these things, otherwise they don't see It. Standing right there, looking right at It, and he can't see It.\n\nL-117 How many ever seen that picture of a cow in the bush, that you just have to look and look? Did you ever see that? Or, seen the picture of Christ in a bush, or in the sky, or clouds? See, that painter has got that so fixed up till you have to look at it just a certain way. Well, then, when you once see it, you can't see nothing else but that. Every time you look, there it is. How many's seen those pictures? Well, sure you have.\n\nL-118 Well, that's the way Christ is, Himself, the Gospel, the Message is. When you once see the Message of the hour, there's nothing else you can see but That. That's all. Everything else is gone, the rest of it's just a filler, see, see, when you once see the Message! [Matthew 13:45-46]\n\nL-119 That's--was in Noah's time. When Noah and his group... see how... When they saw the Message, nothing else mattered. When Moses' group saw It, nothing else mattered. When John's group saw It, nothing else mattered. When Jesus' group saw It, nothing else mattered. When the apostles' group saw It, nothing else mattered. When Luther's group saw It, Wesley's group saw It, Pentecostal group saw It, nothing else mattered, they pulled away from everything. Why? By His foreknowledge He predestinated these things to happen.\n\nL-120 He chooses His own person by His foreknowledge. Like He said in Romans 8 here, that Esau... that the--that the election of God might stand sure. That Esau and Jacob both borned of holy parents, twins, that His election might stand sure and true, He said, \"I hate Esau, and love Jacob,\" before either boy was borned. See? He knows what's in man, He knowed it from the beginning what it was, therefore He can make everything work just exactly on clock time. We get all nervous and flusterated; you never seen Him flusterated, they don't. See? Everything's working all right, just exactly, the clock's ticking. [Romans 9:10-16] 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min\n\nL-121 These things that's supposed to happen, all these women with short hair, and these man wearing their... like they got hair like their wives. I see them, absolutely, have these roller-curlers in their hair, curl it up here in front. What a perversion! That's the results of Satan's Eden. And look...?... She's trying to cut her hair like her husband. Her husband's letting his hair grow like his wife. And she is wearing his clothes, and he's wearing her underneath clothes. See, there you are. She's getting masculine, and he's getting feminish. See, it's Satan's Eden, contrary to what God made it at the beginning. That's the Truth. [I Corinthians 11:1-11], [Deuteronomy 22:5]\n\nL-122 If I don't get started, we'll never get into this. But these things, and the way for Him to do it, and who will do it, that's His Own chosen way, He chooses. That's the way He wants it done.\n\nL-123 As I heard Brother Pearry Green, our pastor at Tucson, preaching the other night about how that God made things some way (I forget what his text was), but he said, \"That's the way God likes it, that's the way God does it.\" Well, that's right.\n\nL-124 Now, who is it among us that's going to tell Him, \"He's wrong\"? Who would dare to stand up in God's face, and say, \"You're wrong, Lord, You should do it the way I want it done, the way Dr. So-and-so said it should be done\"? Who is that far gone in their mental faculties, to say a thing like that? No, you wouldn't come out and say it, but you think it!\n\nL-125 Like on my Message of the Antichrist, \"There shall rise false christs.\" Now, He didn't say false Jesuses. See, nobody would stand still to be called \"Jesus,\" in the term of the Lord. But false christs means \"the anointed.\" [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-126 Oh, they, each one thinks they got anointing, \"Glory to God, he can do this and do that!\" But put him on the Word test and find out where he comes out at, see, on the Message of the hour. They had anointing in the time of Jesus, but not on Him. [Matthew 24:24-26]\n\nL-127 They had anointing in the time... Even Dathan had anointing in the time of Moses. He said, \"Now, don't you think you're the only holy one among us, God's got plenty. We'll just start an organization here, a group of man.\" [Numbers 16:1-3]\n\nL-128 God said to Moses, \"Separate yourself from him,\" and He opened up the earth and swallowed them up. He had give His original Word to Moses, His prophet; that's the only way He ever did do it, and the only way He ever will do it. He doesn't change His plan, see. [Numbers 16:20-35]\n\nL-129 So our ideas is wrong, His ideas are right, always. And don't try to tell Him that He's \"wrong.\" No matter who we think is best qualified, it isn't us to say who's best qualified. Now, there's where you get in your organization.\n\nL-130 Some little brother filled with the Spirit will go into a city and build up an organi-... build up a--a nice group of people, and at the conference they'll meet, and all the holy brethren get along, you know, and say, \"You know what? I believe little Jones here,\" (he's just a little pick among them) \"I think he ought to have that nice big tabernacle, I think. Don't you think that's right?\" No, my. There he goes. And then the congregation's scattered. See? Separate these! God does the separating, He's the one Who does it. But they all, each one, wants to take this little one, put him over here, and this one down here. That's man's idea. [Numbers 16:19-21, 25-26]\n\nL-131 Man has the keys, but God holds the keys actually. They give the disciples, the holy church, the keys; and watch the first time they used it, when Judas had felled by transgression. They got together and cast lots; and the holy brethren. Who would say they wasn't holy brethren? Who say they wasn't holy? But they cast lots, and it fell on Matthias. And when he... What did he ever do? Nothing. But Paul was the elected one! Amen. That was God's choosing: a little, hook-nosed, sarcastic, high-tempered Jew. Not the Matthias, the D.D., you know, he--he was... But Paul, God chose Paul; the church chose--chose Matthias. See? You have no right to tell God He's \"wrong.\" He knows what to do, He knows what the man's made out of. [Acts 1:16-26], [Acts 22:1-14]\n\nL-132 Who would ever... That church ever chose Paul? Oh, no, never. Said, \"That guy's the one that's putting us all in jail.\" But God said, \"I'll show him what he'll suffer for Me.\" He know what. [Acts 9:15-16] 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min All right, no matter who we think is right, God knows who's best qualified because He knows the heart of man, He knows. [Acts 9:1-16]\n\nL-133 Nor does the revival, or does these things, happen at the time that we think they ought to happen. We think, \"It's this time right now, glory to God!\" I notice in our chapters and so forth of the Business Man, \"There's coming right away, hallelujah, a great revival!\"\n\nL-134 Don't be deceived, \"He has already come, and they did to Him what was list.\" See? But they think there's a revival. Is it happening? No! It's done, and dead, it's over. Uh-huh. Notice, this is lamp-trimming time, coming out and going in. \"They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.\" [Matthew 25:4-7], [Matthew 17:9-12]\n\nL-135 Notice here in our text, notice David, king of Israel, he was the one who got the revelation of bringing the ark of God back to his place; that, they never consulted it in the days of Saul 'cause Saul had backslid. So they never consulted the ark at all, the covenant, in the days of Saul, 'cause he had backslid and got away from God. So David, quickly, with inspiration... Now notice this, it's a very treacherous text if you don't get it right. And I feel that the hour is coming where we should be man instead of babies. Uh-huh. We should have strong meat instead of milk. [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-136 Notice David, king of Israel, the king had just been freshly anointed the king; or elected king, Saul... Samuel anointed him by the will of God; and he was absolutely God's chosen king, no doubt to it. And here he is, and inspiration strikes him. It was revealed to David. He got the revelation, nobody else had said nothing about it. \"Let us go and fetch the, ark, 'cause that's the will of God that we have the ark here with us, that we consult God by this ark.\" Very, very gallant thing. Don't you think so? All right. [I Chronicles 13:1-3]\n\nL-137 Remember, but, him being king, and got the revelation, he overstepped his place. There was a prophet in the land by the name of Nathan, he was the one that was ordained to get the revelation. There's anything to be spoke, He said, \"The Lord doeth nothing until He reveals it to His servants the prophet.\" But, you see, David being king, with the anointing upon him... Now, is that the Scripture? Anointing upon him, and got a true revelation; but it was wrong. Because Nathan was the prophet of that age, and the revelation never come to Nathan, and when the revelation come to David he never even consulted Nathan about it. He's just going to go ahead and do what he wanted to do. Uh-huh. [Amos 3:7], [II Samuel 7:2-4]\n\nL-138 But notice who David consulted here in the 13th chapter, \"But he consulted the captains of thousands and of hundreds,\" back to his congregation. See? \"Now, don't you think we should do...?\" That isn't it. Now, he was trying to do God a service, but he wasn't ordained to do it; see, 'cause God had a way. [I Chronicles 13:1-2]\n\nL-139 Just the same as God could have spoke to the--the king about his sore and getting well, but He didn't, He had a ordained way of doing it, that was His prophet. So He spoke to the prophet, Isaiah, told him to go back and tell Hezekiah what would happen. [Isaiah 38:1-8]\n\nL-140 Now, Hezekiah was talking face to face with God, and--and God could talk to Hezekiah, of course, but He made certain channels! You understand it? God has His Own set way of doing things: sending revivals, talking, speaking, whatever it is. He has His way of doing it, and we are nobody to tell Him how to do it. He does it the way it pleases Him to do it. [Isaiah 38:1-8]\n\nL-141 So, you see, David, being inspired... Now, you remember I said the, anointing, the false anointing? Remember the Holy Spirit can come and anoint a person, and still it's out of the will of God. Here, It proves it right here. See? We have to go through God's way of doing it, not our ways, God's way of doing it. Cause, David, being a king, anointed, anointed with the Spirit of God upon him (a type of Jesus Christ), but that wasn't God's channel. [I Chronicles 13:1-5]\n\nL-142 When all the congregation, \"it pleased them,\" the Bible said. Notice, captains of thousands and of hundreds, also the priests and theologians thought that was \"wonderful.\" There is your Bible schools and everything else, they thought it was \"wonderful.\" Even all of the people agreed, and the priests, and--and all of them agreed that the king's anointing was right. Notice! But God had not promised to reveal His Word in Its season to them. God had His way of revealing His Word, but not to them. Remember, it was contrary to God. [I Chronicles 13:1-5] 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min\n\nL-143 Something like in the days of Micaiah the son of Imla. Do you remember that story? Judah and Israel were separated, and they had two different kingdoms, and Ahab was the king over one kingdom. And Jehoshaphat was over the king--kingdom of Judah, I believe it was; and Ahab was over Israel, Jerusalem. [II Chronicles 18:1-20]\n\nL-144 Notice, and then here come in a bunch of alien and took off part of the God-given land that God had give to Israel, and these Philistines up there, Syrians, were holding that ground and was feeding their own children off of the ground that belonged to Israel. And so they needed that ground to feed their own children and their own families. God gave them... That was their God-given rights. [II Chronicles 18:1-20]\n\nL-145 And so Ahab calls down Jehoshaphat, and said, \"Come down.\" He said, \"Looky there what our enemy's doing. Is it right that we, the people of God, with a God-given right that we should have this land, it belongs to us, God through His prophet, Joshua, divided this land, it should be ours; it belongs to us, to our children, and here the communists has took it over, and we have... We're so hungry, and they have got our God-given rights. Don't you think that we should go up there and take our land back? If you'll join your forces: if you Methodists, and Presbyterians, and all, and Presbyterians, and Lutheran, and so forth, all take the ecumenical council here now, we'll all set together, and we'll take the thing.\" (I'm saying and speaking in a parable now) \"We'll go get it.\" [II Chronicles 18:1-20]\n\nL-146 \"Why,\" he said, \"certainly, we're all one.\" Uh-huh. Now, the Bible said, \"How can two walk together except they be agreed?\" See? There where that great man, that great Pentecostal man, Jehoshaphat, got mixed up with the wrong crowd. And that's what happened to our Pentecostals today. There's some real man in there, but they're mixed up in that denominational crowd. Get out of that thing! It's cursed of the Lord! [Amos 3:3]\n\nL-147 Notice now! There he was, and he said, \"Yes, that sounds reasonable.\" Said, \"Our church is here, is our people; after all, we're all Jews.\" Uh-huh. \"Sure, we'll go up with you.\" But is just enough religion left in Jehoshaphat to say, \"Don't you think we--we should consult the Lord first?\" See? \"I think it'd be a good idea.\" [II Chronicles 18:1-7]\n\nL-148 Why, Ahab, \"Of course.\" Said, \"Why, oh, sure, I should have thought of that.\" \"Well, is there a man of God somewhere? Have you got a prophet?\" \"Ah, I got four hundred of them. I got the whole council down here, the whole denomination. They're Hebrew prophets.\" Now remember, the Bible said they were \"prophets, Hebrew prophets,\" not heathen prophets, Hebrew prophets; a school of them, a theological seminary. \"Well, bring them up!\" [II Chronicles 18:1-20]\n\nL-149 And the kings dressed themselves and set before him to impress the prophet. And here come, I believe it was Zedekiah come up, the great chief of the district councilmen, or ever what he was, come up there among them. He made hisself two big horns, he said, \"I have heard from God. THUS SAITH THE LORD, 'With these horns you'll push the Syrians plumb out of the land.'\" [II Chronicles 18:5, 23] \"O glory!\" everybody thought that was wonderful, fine.\n\nL-150 Watch how close it gets to that razor edge now, between right and wrong. And remember it'll fall on one or the other sides, till it comes down sometime like a honed razor between the difference of right and wrong. It's got to be every Word of God; not just almost every Word, but every Word! And it's got down today, not to Lutherans, not to Methodists, not to Pentecostals, but to that honed age, in this age where the antichrist anointing is so perfectly, it would deceive the very Elected, they'll fall on the wrong side if they don't watch it, like a wedge. Watch! Be careful! We're not living in a Pentecostal age now. We're passed that age, just the same as it's passed Lutheran, and passed... See? [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-151 Notice. Now the prophets all prophesied, four hundred of them, well fed, well fixed, Hebrew prophets gave them witness, one accord, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD, 'Go up, the Lord is with you.'\" [II Chronicles 18:5]\n\nL-152 Jehoshaphat said, \"Well, that--that sounds all right. But,\" said, \"have you got another one?\" \"Another one? We got the whole denomination here, we got the whole council gathered out here. Why do we need 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min another one?\" He said, \"Ah,\" said, \"I thought maybe there might be another one.\" [II Chronicles 18:6]\n\nL-153 He said, \"Oh, yes, there is another one, but he don't even belong to this council.\" Uh-huh. \"He's an outcast. It's Micaiah, the son of Imla, and I hate him.\" See? Said, \"They won't receive him into fellowship, and he's just a common outcast to begin with. And he's constantly, everything he prophesies, he just won't encourage my seminary a bit.\" Uh-huh. \"And he does all these things evil, he's always prophesying evil against me, just to be different.\" [II Chronicles 18:7]\n\nL-154 \"Oh,\" Jehoshaphat said, \"don't let the king say such a thing as that. But I'd like to hear what this, man's got to say.\" Said, \"Well, we'll find him.\" So they sent out somewhere in the wilderness, and they sent a man. [II Chronicles 18:7-8]\n\nL-155 Said, told him, said, \"Now, on your road back now, I want to tell you something. Do you want to get back in the denomination again?\" See? \"Do you want to have fellowship with all of them again? If you do, say the same thing the district presbyter says, say the same thing the bishop says, and they'll bring you right back. Now is the time to do it.\" [II Chronicles 18:12-13]\n\nL-156 But could you imagine a anointed, true prophet of God compromising on one Word of God? No indeedy! He said, \"As the Lord lives, I'll only say what God says!\" We need a son of Imla. \"As the Lord lives, I'll only say what He says.\" That's right, \"What He says.\" So when they got down there before the people, all the prophets, they said, \"Now, you say they... He said, \"Wait, give me tonight, let me see what the Lord's going to say.\" So, that night, the Lord appeared to him in a vision and told him what to say. [II Chronicles 18:12-15]\n\nL-157 The next morning he said, \"What do you say, Imla?\" when they was all standing out... I mean \"Micaiah, son of Imla,\" said, \"what do you say now? We're all here together, all of the priests, and all of the prophets, and all of the kings, and everything setting here together. What do you say now at this great council?\" Said, \"Go on up,\" said, \"but I seen Israel scattered like sheep having no shepherd.\" And Ahab said, \"What did I tell you! That renegade can only prophesy evil against me!\" [II Chronicles 18:16-25]\n\nL-158 How could he say anything else when God was saying the same thing? A prophet's supposed to be the mouth of God speaking, not his own thinking. His... You see, he's com-... so completely yielded to God, he don't want to hurt nothing, but he has to say what God says, 'cause he has no control of It hisself. See? He said, \"Now, didn't I tell you?\" [Amos 3:7-8]\n\nL-159 And then up come the--the big man with the horn, and smacked him in the mouth, he said, \"Which a-way went the Spirit of God when It went out of me?\" In other words, let me try to break that down, \"Looky here in... Looky here, I want to tell you something, Micaiah. Do you realize that I am a master in the Scripture? Do you realize that I have the anointing?\" Or, \"the Baptism,\" we'd say it today. \"Do you realize that I have that?\" [II Chronicles 18:15-25]\n\nL-160 Imla said, \"I'm not doubting that.\" He said, \"But listen! The Spirit of God has told me, and bore witness with all my four hundred here, that we're 'going to push the Syrians out of the land.' And who are you to come around and say that our great king is going to be slain?\" He said, \"The Spirit of God told me that.\" [II Chronicles 18:1-20]\n\nL-161 Let me just break it down so you'll understand it. And maybe we find Micaiah say, \"Last night in the vision, sir, I saw God setting upon a Throne. And I saw all the host of Heaven gathered around Him, uh-huh, and they were having a council in Heaven. They said, 'Who can we get to go down and deceive Ahab? Because under the Throne here is a prophet, a true prophet, his name is Elijah. And he has prophesied by My Word and said that \"That wicked Ahab, because he slew Naboth, the dogs will lick the blood of that wicked man,\" and we've got to make That come to pass because It's already been spoken, It's THUS SAITH THE LORD! It has to come to pass, got to be there. And how are we going to do it?'\" [II Chronicles 18:1-20], [I Kings 21:17-26]\n\nL-162 \"Then down from the creeping regions of the lost, way down in there come a spirit moving up, he said, 'I'm a 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min deceiver, and if I can do a service to You, I'll go down and get in his prophet.'\" Because they was so organized, they'll only understand one thing, and that's a little emotions. \"'And I'll cause them to prophesy a lie. And I'll get Ahab to listen to those dignitaries instead of Your real prophet; 'cause he'll examine everything he says with your Word, he'll examine his visions by the Word, he'll examine everything he does by the Word, and if it ain't with the Word he wouldn't listen to it. But if it... I can deceive these others, and I'll... they... Ahab's got so much confidence in that great unity together of their safety, so they go around together and they'll get together. And I'll cause Ahab to listen to them, go out there. And that's how we'll do it.'\" [II Chronicles 18:1-25]\n\nL-163 \"God said, 'You can do it, you're a real deceiver; you go on down.'\" [II Chronicles 18:18-22] And then Zedekiah smacked him in the mouth, said, \"Where was you...?\" [II Chronicles 18:23] He said, \"You'll find out when you're setting in the inner cell.\" Uh-huh. [II Chronicles 18:24-26] He said, \"Go up!\" said Zedekiah to the king. Said, \"Go up and return in peace!\" [II Chronicles 18:27]\n\nL-164 Ahab said, \"Take that fellow and put him into the prison. Put him in shackles, feed him bread of sorrow and water of sorrow. And when I return back with my victory from out here, which my prophets has told me that 'this revival is sure to happen,'\" said, \"I'll tend to that fellow!\" [II Chronicles 18:24-26] Listen at Micaiah's last words to that man: \"If you return at all, then God never spoke to me.\" Oh! [II Chronicles 18:27]\n\nL-165 See, God has His way of doing things. These man thought they were doing God a service. Be careful! Not emotion, not enthusiasm, not imaginations, but it must be \"THUS SAITH THE LORD,\" must be right. All right, no matter... We find these things so.\n\nL-166 Notice now when David had made this great proclamation, and it seemed like that it was good, a good thing to do. There we find out that the... (Am I tiring you? Am I too late to have another?) David made this great proclamation, he consulted not the prophet.\n\nL-167 Now, anyone knows that Amos 3:7 says that God promised that He would never do nothing until first He revealed it to His prophet. Through the church ages we've had reformers; but promised by Malachi 4 that there would be a prophet in the land in the last days (because it has to fit that pattern, see) before the end time come. [Amos 3:7], [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-168 Before Jesus come the first, Elijah come, Elijah of Malachi 3. Matthew 11 says so, \"If you can understand it, this is who was spoken of, 'Behold I send My--My messenger before Me.'\" Now, He's prophesied, all theologians believe that; that, in the last day, the Spirit of Elijah is to come, too. It has to come five times, God uses that Spirit: Elisha, Elijah, John the Baptist, and for the Gentile church, and then for the Jews in Revelation the 11th chapter. That's, God's g-r-a-c-e, f-a-i-t-h, Je-s-u-s, Jesus, the--the letter five. Can't stop at four, it has to go to five. See? Notice! [Malachi 3:1], [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-169 Now, He promised that, so that sets the Bible just exactly to this day, and the Sodom and Gomorrah. And Elijah was not... That wasn't Elijah; That was the Spirit of God on Elijah; Elijah was just a man. Now, we've had Elijahs, and Elijahs' coats, and Elijahs' mantles, and Elijahs' everything. But the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ. He is to come according to Matthew the seventeen-... Luke 17:30, says the Son of man is to reveal Himself among His people. Not a man, God! But it'll come through a prophet. Now, He never had two major prophets at the same time, never, in the world. See? No matter how much there's... two--two heads can't... It has to be one head. God has to get one man under His control. See? There's one God; there was Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but one God over it all, notice, and just used them offices. So has He with Elijah, the Spirit of Elijah; he used that Spirit, but the same God controlling It all the time to fulfill His Word. [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-170 Now, notice in this now, David thought he had everything in order. And he was inspired. See how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man? But it's got to be in the order of the anointing. The outside spirit can be anointed with the Holy Ghost, and the soul as dark as pitch. The cocklebur grows on the same water that builds... puts life into the wheat, puts life into the cocklebur; but at the bottom of the cocklebur, it's a cocklebur life. It's rejoicing, and blooming, and got life, and doing everything that the wheat does, but the soul of it is cocklebur. See? False teachers can rise, teaching all kind of trinitarianism and everything else, and be anointed with the Holy Ghost, and perform just as many miracles as the 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min true Gospel can. But by the Word here, that's what does it. See what I mean? Now, it's all right to teach this, I guess, I'm--I'm in a interdenominational tabernacle this morning, in--in this hotel here. [II Peter 2:1-5]\n\nL-171 Notice, watch what we're saying. Now, well, listen. David had all the emotion that the real revival had. Notice! They shouted, they screamed, they danced, they really got something out of that anointing. Sure did! All like a real revival, but, you notice, God was not in it. God was not in it. He had a prophet setting right there in the land that they ought to have knowed. See? David should have knowed that.\n\nL-172 Same thing today, we got all the mechanics, like the great denominations, crusades of our time, but the result's turning out the same as it was then; our results of our great crusades, and all of our big fine reason, our big buildings, and our big... building thousands, and adding members and things, it turns out the same way, all a flop. I'm not saying that to be different, I'm saying that to be honest before God Who's Book I'm standing by this morning. See? All turns out a flop, same results.\n\nL-173 Now let us see what happened when God (in His time and age) and His prophets are not considered, just depend on theology, priests, denominationalism like we do today. Now, closely. It all gets messed up. If the true Spirit of God there, It'll direct it into the Word; not just one place in the Word, the entire Word for the entire age. See?\n\nL-174 The Day of Pentecost, the Spirit directed it right into That, to Joel 2:38. See? The day of Luther, It directed it right into That; Wesley; in this last pentecostal move; but this is another age, this is the calling out of the Bride. Not two thousand years ago at Pentecost, or the repeat, or the return. Pentecost... [Joel 2:28]\n\nL-175 The Holy Spirit was in Luther, the Holy Spirit was in Wesley; it's God's Word being anointed. And the, Holy Spirit returned to the people of the age and they begin to have the restoration of the gifts. They found out, by yielding themself to God, the Holy Ghost spoke in tongues through them. They laid their hands on the sick, and they was recovered. They danced in the Spirit. See? That was the age of the reformation bringing the church back into order. And the last order of the church was placing the gifts into the church; like Luther placed justification, Wesley placed sanctification, Pentecost placed the gifts. But what did they do? The same mistake, as nature has patterned to the wheat stalk, they denominated (which is against God, contrary to God).\n\nL-176 Now, we find out that when... Then when these stalk gathers comes together, they form their own idea. And no matter... When the \"new issue,\" as they call it, come forth out of the Assemblies of God, what did they do? They couldn't receive It. No matter how much Truth it was, the baptism in the Name of Jesus Christ, they were already the General Council. Man had done took it over, the Spirit had done left them. Right! And then this come forth... I've talked to some of your best leaders; they say, \"Well, what would we do now?\" They would embarrass themselves. When, they know it's the Truth; if they don't, they're spiritually blind and ignorant to the Bible. Not saying that nasty, now, saying that reverently. Cause, there's not a place in the Bible where anybody was ever baptized using those titles, \"Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\" And never was used till after the ecumenical council, the Roman Catholic church. Their own catechism witnesses the same thing. It's a Catholic dogma! Not a Bible doctrine, but a Catholic dogma. And you Methodists brought out your catechisms and everything just like they had, just gradually growing out of it. And now when you come to Pentecost, and spread out some of those dogmas, you still held on to them.\n\nL-177 But now is the Bride-calling, now is when the Seven Seals has been opened, now when the complete things that the reformers left has to be opened; and only Malachi 4 can do that, because it takes the revelation straight from God to an individual to do so. That's right! It can't come to a group, never did. One man! That's what God promised in the shadows of the coming for His Bride, an Eliezer. See? [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-178 Notice when priests, ministers, and so forth, get their own inspiration, and truly anointed. David was anointed. The Bible said so. But, you see, he went through the wrong resource, he went to the wrong channel. He channeled his anointing on the wrong side, to the people and what they thought, to the captains, what they thought, instead of to God's holy channel to find out what THUS SAITH THE LORD was, \"Is this the time for this? Is this the season for this? Is this the will of God?\"\n\nL-179 Then if he's a true prophet of God, he'll go before God first, say, \"Father, what is it?\" like Nathan did later on to 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min David. David said, \"Is it right for me to live in a house of cedar, and the ark of my God under tents out here?\" [I Chronicles 17:1]\n\nL-180 And look at Nathanael, said, \"David, do all that's in your heart, for God is with you. You're a anointed vessel of God.\" [I Chronicles 17:2]\n\nL-181 But that being a prophet, and his mistake, and God's duty bound to His prophet. That night He appeared to him, said, \"Go tell My servant David, I admire his courage, I love him for this, 'cause he's a man after My Own heart, and I know it's time that My ark would be that way, put under something, but I just... It ain't the season for it to happen. I'll let his son do it, but I won't let him do it.\" [I Chronicles 17:3-15]\n\nL-182 Then here come Nathan with, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD, David, the great revelation you had is as wrong as it was when you brought the ark up.\" (Uh-huh! Uh-huh! See?) \"Don't you do it. Don't try it! But God said He'll have 'your son to do it.'\" There! See? There you are!\n\nL-183 David was anointed to say that because aforehand he could see it, just as Abraham sought for a City on the earth. You know, he was looking for It because he was going to live here someday, Abraham is, in that City. And he went around looking for It. And right on the same grounds where he looked, it was just above him then, and will return in the Millennium and he'll live in that City. But being a prophet, he was ordained and inspired, he knowed there was a City somewhere, and he was looking for It. But, you see, the whole revelation of it was hid from him, it wasn't for his age. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... on down to John, where he saw It coming down from God out of Heaven. That was the City.\n\nL-184 See, everything has to be in its season. You plant your wheat in the spring and... or in the fall and cut it the next summer. See? It's got to come up through the stalk, then come up through the tassel, and shuck, and on into the... It's got to be in season. All nature runs in continuity. The Spirit of God made nature, and all God and nature in continuity. All the things that's put in the temple was a pattern of what He saw in Heaven.\n\nL-185 You see a tree struggling trying to live, that means there's a tree that don't die. You see a man struggling for life, it shows that there is a tabernacle waiting somewhere that don't die. \"If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting.\" The good Heavenly Father permitted me to walk behind that curtain one day and see it. How many heard the...?... See? Looking a-pass the curtain of time. There it was just the same as I'm preaching to you all, there they stood. Souls under the altar crying, \"How long?\" Not just a myth, somebody who had intelligence: \"How long, Lord?\" See? While we feel that now, as our age, like Brother Bill Dauch setting here at ninety-three. There's something longing for that young man again. There's something... You'd give anything. How I'd like to. Brother Jack, and all the rest of us. Go back, Brother Gerholtzer, in here, into that young manhood. What do you want to do it for? To be young and run around again? No, sir! Because we feel we'd have more time to glorify this God that we love. [Revelation 6:9-10]\n\nL-186 And my dear brethren, I have this Message this morning, there is a Land beyond the river that they call that sweet forever. There we'll glorify Him through the ages, and all the ages, and Eternity. Why do we feel that? Because the deep is calling to the deep. And as long as the deep's a-calling, there's got to be a deep to respond to that call or there wouldn't be no call. Before there can be a creation, there has to be a creator first to create the creation, or there's no... That shows the very evidence that there is. [Psalms 42:7]\n\nL-187 Notice these priests, all out of line. Notice the anointing, all right, nothing wrong with the anointing. Same with you Pentecostals, but watch what channel you're moving in now. The day has changed since Pentecost, something else for us. If there'd been no prophet in the land, perhaps David would've been right. That's right. But there stood Nathan, vindicated, ordained, witnessed by God to be a prophet.\n\nL-188 Watch! The ark in the Bible always is a type of the Word to us, because it was the Word of God in the ark. And was... Notice the ark that they brought up, look how they did it. It was not put in its original God-ordained position. Now, God said back here in the Law that it must... how it must be done, how this ark must be moved, and who it must be moved by. But David, under his anointing... 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min\n\nL-189 My brethren, don't you miss this. And my sisters, you who want to be women preachers and so forth, don't you miss this. No matter how much your anointing is, you've got to get in God's provided position. David's anointing was all right, but in doing it he got enthused and stepped over the boundary line. What did he do? He stepped over the boundary line. Instead of putting the ark in its original position, he carried it on a new cart and not over the hearts of the Levites. It was supposed to be carried on the shoulder of the Levites, which is over the heart. The Word is not in the mind, It's in the heart! \"Not on a new cart.\" What was that? Some... Represented something new, David did there, spoke of every denomination there'd ever be. God's Word is not to be by... carried by state presbyters or bishops, and so forth, of denominations. It's the Baptism of the Holy Ghost in the heart of man, and not in some ecclesiastical move. The Holy Spirit is a treasure of God's love in the heart of man and women to obey. See? [Matthew 24:24], [I Chronicles 13:7], [I Chronicles 15:2-4, 12-15]\n\nL-190 Was on the shoulders of His ministers, His ministers was the Levites. Put it up over their left shoulder and packed that ark like that, because it was up over their heart. They had the burden of the Word on their heart. Amen! Now you got the burden of your denomination on your heart, the burden of your congregation: whether you're going to build this, or do that, or do something else. The burden of how many more you're going to get to your denomination; instead of the burden of the Word of the Lord, till that people will see only the Word of God and nothing else. But you got It on a new cart now. See? They're packing It up here in the ecumenical council even, shouldered. I don't want to get critical, and may God help me. I just telling you the Truth. [I Chronicles 15:15]\n\nL-191 Now, influenced by creeds and ecumenical councils, the Word, the real Word of the season of that age was ignored, because they had a lot of emotion. But David, the anointed king... He was king, but he was anointed king. You say, \"I'm a minister, anointed.\" Then stay a minister, don't try to be a prophet. See? If you're evangelist, stay evangelist.\n\nL-192 Remember Uzziah, in the days of Isaiah, the young king... the young prophet. Uzziah was a great man, anointed man, God blessed him; blessed hisself. Yeah, I preached on that to you here one time. And one day he got so highly up till he thought he could just take the office of a priest, and he took the... finally went in before the Lord, and the... them priests told him, \"Don't do that, Uzziah!\" But he got exalted. The prophet couldn't tell him nothing. The priests knowed their order, they was keeping their order, he said, \"That's not your order, Uzziah. Don't do, that!\" [II Chronicles 26:1-5, 16-21]\n\nL-193 Well, he made them \"Shut up!\" And he went with the--with the fire, in to offer, take a priest's job; he was anointed king, not a priest. And those priests was trying to tell him, \"You're a wonderful king, you're anointed, God has blessed us now; but you're a king, not a priest.\" [II Chronicles 26:16-21]\n\nL-194 And you pastors shouldn't never tell a prophet what to do, or you evangelists tell a pastor. See, each one has his office if it is perfectly identified. [II Chronicles 26:16-21] So he went in with the fire, and was stricken down with leprosy and died. Now here's David, king, David's trying to do the same thing here. He's taken it upon hisself. \"Well, that's fine, got to go. Looky, lots of people. What do you say, captain? You have ten thousand.\" \"Glory to God, David, I feel the Spirit.\" Oh, he did! He did feel It. \"What do you think, David? Do you feel It?\" \"Glory to God, It's all over me! Let's check it and see if it's right, let's see. Where does the ark belong?\" \"With us! Belongs among us.\" [I Chronicles 13:1-7], [I Chronicles 15:2-4, 12-15]\n\nL-195 \"Who should we consult? Sure, the ark. Just the same thing as that ground belonged to--to Israel instead of the Philistines. That's right. They belong to us. And as I feel the anointing, too.\" The captains of hundreds, all the congregation, \"Glory to God!\" They clapped, and they shouted, and they danced, and jumped up and down. [I Chronicles 13:1-7], [II Chronicles 15:2-4, 12-15]\n\nL-196 They had the Spirit, but what do you think Father was thinking? \"How I've sent Nathan, that prophet down there! They know what to do, and so does David, but now he's just all enthused and stepped right over his boundary line and went to do this.\" [I Chronicles 13:1-7], [I Chronicles 15:2-4]\n\nL-197 All right, notice, \"carry It on the shoulders\" was God's original plan. There is five must's. I want you to put these 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min down, if you're... I see you're writing. (And it's twenty minutes, twenty something minutes after ten, so I'll try to be through by eleven, if possible. I'll hurry just as quick as I can.) No matter how sincere a man may be in doing God a service, no matter how sincere, how much anointed, how much of a Presbyterian, Baptist, Pentecostal; no matter whether you're a bishop, deacon, whatever you are, pastor, evangelist, prophet, whatever it might be; there's five must's that must be considered first. No matter how much anointing, how good it seemed, how the people shouting, everything the Spirit's a-doing, there is a must. [I Chronicles 15:12-15]\n\nL-198 Now, my brethren, while you're getting your paper ready, can you understand now why? Now remember, you've all thought, and have been taught among you, not... (see, I'm speaking across the nation)... that I did not believe in speaking in tongues. I do believe in speaking in tongues, but you can still speak in tongues and not have the Holy Ghost. First Corinthians 13, says, \"Though I speak with tongue of man and angels, I ain't nothing yet.\" See? That's the anointing of the Holy Ghost, that has nothing to do with the soul inside you. You can speak in tongues and deny the Word. I've seen it done, and you see it too. See? A woman can preach the Gospel and... See? They can do all... They cut their hair, and still shout and speak in tongues and everything else. Uh-huh, that's exactly right. You got to line up with the Truth of the Word. [I Corinthians 13:1-3]\n\nL-199 Notice! No matter how sincere a man may be, no matter how great he's used of God, no matter what he is, he must be this: must be... The thing that he's speaking of must be timely by the Bible. Somebody say, \"Well, Moses back there.\" I know what Moses did, but that not what God's doing today. \"Well, back yonder, thirty years ago, Luther said...\" That might be fine, but that's not what He's doing today. \"Well, forty years ago, Pentecost fell.\" But that's not what He's doing today. See? It must be timely. [Ecclesiastes 3:1-8]\n\nL-200 It must be according to the Scripture. It must be in season, the second one. Thirdly, and it must be according to the way that God's Word spoke it would be. [Luke 16:17], [Matthew 5:18-19], [Ecclesiastes 3:1-8]\n\nL-201 And you say, \"Glory to God! The Holy Ghost fell on me, hallelujah, just like It did on the Day of Pentecost.\" But that might be different today. It fell on David, too, didn't it? Sure, It did. Fell on Uzziah, but it was wrong! See, you got to go deeper than that now. See? You got to go deeper than that. Now, don't feel hurt, just--just be reverent. See? [I Chronicles 13:1-7], [I Chronicles 15:2-4], [II Chronicles 26:16-21]\n\nL-202 And notice, and it also must come to the man of God's choosing. Not a denominational choosing, none of the people's choosing, but according to God's choosing. And if it's a message from God, of a great revelation from God, it must come to His prophet. Now, if you want the Scripture of that, it's Amos 3:7. See? Now, it must. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-203 There's five things it must be: It must be in season. It must be at the time God said it would be. It must be written in the Word of God. It must be in the season of God's time, see. And it must be by God's choosing. [Ecclesiastes 3:1-8], [Matthew 5:18-19]\n\nL-204 And God doesn't need any of us to interpret His Word, God is His Own interpreter. He don't need our seminaries. He don't need our wisdom, it's nonsense. See? Eve got that, uh-huh, and missed the Interpretation by her wisdom. [Isaiah 46:5-13]\n\nL-205 Say, \"Oh, boy, that guy's a smart man.\" Well, that don't mean a thing. Sure. Ahab was a smart man. Belteshazzar was a smart man. Satan was most cunning and crude, subtle, nobody could withstand him, none at all.\n\nL-206 I don't depend on... none... no wisdom, just depend on God. See? How is God? He is the Word. And then how does God interpret His Own Word? Listen close now, don't miss these things. How does God interpret His Own Word? By making It come to pass, not just one here, but all of it for that season. [Isaiah 46:5-13]\n\nL-207 Not say, \"Noah go out and preach,\" the inspired, but, \"Build an ark, put doors in it, fix it this way, and that way.\" What if he put the door on top instead of the bottom? What if he put the window on the bottom, the door on top? See? It's got to be instructed according to the time, because that's exactly what God's going to use it for. It must be that way, and it must come by inspiration. [Genesis 6:8-22]\n\nL-208 I heard a guy say one time, said, \"I believe that man prays for the sick, I believe it's fine. But as being a prophet,\" said \"I believe he's God's prophet; but as a teacher, why, he's a 'Jesus only.'\" What a... What kind of a person would you 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min call that? A man doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\nL-209 The very word prophet means that \"he is a revealer of the Word of God,\" the Interpretation only comes to that. And that's why today we're in such a need of this great person that's supposed to be sent to us in the form of the prophet Elijah, because it'll be the revelation of God made known to us by vindication, showing that it's the day and the hour and the season that God promised it to be in. And, remember, he'll be spoken against; always has been, always will be. Rejected, just like the shuck will pull... First he'll be accepted, because the shuck only holds the wheat until it's able to get forth to the sun. Pentecost will only sheltered the Message, give It an open door until It gets scattered, and then the shuck will pull away, and the wheat will lay in the Presence of the Son, see, to ripen. [Daniel 2:47], [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-210 There won't be any denomination, you just remember. Brother Jack here's a historian, many of you here are. There's never been a revival but about three years after the revival they started a denomination on it. Is that right? And this last great miracle move of God in this last days, it's went twenty years; and it's a million miles from a denomination, going further away all the time; the shuck's pulling away, no cooperation, no nothing with It. See? Always it pulls away from It. There can't be no more, it's a wheat now. But we're plenty green. Uh-huh. That's right. Have to lay in the Presence of the Son to be mellowed up, that's all of it. Plenty green; we haven't got the sincerity, the sacredness, the thing we ought to have in our midst, to know that the Spirit of the living God, moving in His Word and showing us the things yet.\n\nL-211 We have false impersonators rise up. What's that to do? To deceive. The Bible said they would. \"As Jambres and Jannes withstood Moses, so, will these in the last days.\" See? They do the same thing, come right along impersonating It, just exactly. See? Be careful! Watch the Doctrine of the Bible. Watch the message that follows them signs! Still the same old school of message? Forget it! [II Timothy 3:1-9]\n\nL-212 God sent the miracles and signs to attract attention of His people. When Jesus come just healing the sick and so forth, so did the prophets. They thought, \"Oh, glory, He's a-coming, He's going to be a Pharisee. He's going to be a Sadducee.\"\n\nL-213 But He said, \"You generation of serpents and vipers.\" Said, \"You're of your father the Devil, his works you'll do.\" Said, \"Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His Blood, there's no Life in you.\" He didn't explain It. He didn't have to explain It. Hallelujah. That was for another season. Uh-huh. He just said what He had to say, \"I always do that what is pleasing to the Father, and that's keeping His Word. If I don't, My life and My works don't compare with His Word I'm supposed to do, then don't believe Me, I'm not Him; but if it does, then believe the works if you can't believe Me,\" He said. Notice now these must's that must be done. [Matthew 3:7], [Matthew 12:34], [Matthew 23:33], [Luke 3:7], [John 8:44], [John 10:37-38]\n\nL-214 Now, see, God had not revealed the thing to them by His provided way, He had revealed it by inspiration, but it was in the wrong channel. See, inspiration will go fine, but if it's in the wrong channel, it'll be channeled wrong. Like you take a bullet and shoot it directly to a target, it's making its way right to the target, but a puff of wind can blow it out. Now, in your automobile, you go down the road sixty, seventy miles an hour and a puff of wind blows you, you can straighten your wheels back up, throw it back on the road again. But you can't a bullet; ain't nothing there to straighten its wheels up, it misses the target. See, it must travel in its original channel.\n\nL-215 So must the Word of God travel in Its original channel. No little puff of wind's going to blow It off, no little denomination that's going to blow It off, no little persecution's going to blow It off, It's directed to the point! It's going to hit there, too. And then God... When It hits that point, God will vindicate It, \"Bull's-eye!\" Uh-huh, exactly what He said He'll do. Here it is in the Scriptures, this, \"THUS SAITH THE LORD, 'It shall come to pass!'\" Here it is. See? There you are.\n\nL-216 Now, God had not revealed it in His provided way. So they went about to do it apart from His Word, and apart from the season, just the same as they have now. When man, no matter how sincere, trying to do Him a service outside of His provided way, they always mess it up. Like Balaam, Balaam thought he was doing God a service. 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min\n\nL-217 Do you think God lies? Does God ever change His mind? Well, people act today like He did. When He said for women not to cut their hair; they say, \"We can cut it, Dr. So-and-so said we could. Brother So-and-so said you're just too narrow-minded.\" Uh-huh, uh-huh. See?\n\nL-218 \"Well, can this happen? This happen?\" \"Yeah, uh-huh, So-and-so said so.\" God don't change His mind.\n\nL-219 Do you believe Balaam was a prophet? The Bible said he was. Do you believe he was a prophet? Now, remember, Balak come to him and said, \"Go down and curse this people, for they're all over the face of the earth. They're not even a denomination, not a nation, they're just a scattered bunch; and we are the dignitaries of the land. Now you go down there and curse them people, and I'll pay for it.\" And Balaam done exactly what a prophet should do, he said, \"I'll not go. You just wait here, overnight, let me see what God says do.\" [Numbers 22:5-12]\n\nL-220 So he went in, he said, \"Lord, there's some people out here with me that come, wanted me go down and curse some other people down there.\" Said, \"What do You want me to do about it?\" God said, \"Don't you go, for them's My people!\" Balaam went out, said, \"Go on back to your house. I can't go with you, God told me not to do it.\" Now, there's God's original Word: \"Don't go!\" Well, then they went back, said, \"You know, your bishop wouldn't listen.\" [Numbers 22:12-30]\n\nL-221 \"Well,\" the king said, \"tell you what we do. He needs a little money, I believe that could persuade him. Or maybe I'll make him state presbyter, maybe I'll get him some great something to do. I'll might make him the bishop, you can't tell what I might do. Here, I'll tell you what I'll do. You fellows ain't got enough education to persuade him anyhow; your his and hain'ts, and tote and fetch and carry, ain't right. He wouldn't listen to you, we'll send a real educated bunch down, more dignitary.\" They went down there, said, \"Doctor Balaam, Doctor Balaam, greetings to you. I bring you salutations from the king.\" \"Morning, brethren.\" See? \"Now, Doctor Balaam...\" And, oh, the vocabulary, how it was really poured on. And said, \"Now, the king has said that he will exalt you, and he will also give you great honor. And, you know, they only offered you so much money to take this charge, but the king says he'll triple it, quad-triple it, if you'll just come to take it.\" Then, Balaam, got to get itching hands. He got foolish ideas and he stirred his mind. [Numbers 22:12-30]\n\nL-222 Now, remember, he called God by it, anointed, but he stirred God right away from the original plan. And that's exactly what Pentecost has done! To be popular, you Oneness, you Trinity, for popularity you denominated to be different, you organized and you're dead! You'll never rise again. But, you see, you ought to have stayed with God's orig-... He pulled you out of that Assembly to make you a people, but you organized and went right back into the same puke you come (excuse me) out of, the same stuff you come out of, \"As a dog goes to its vomit and a hog to its wallow.\" I'm sorry I said that, forgive me, that's not right for the platform here. See? I just said that in the flesh. Notice now that that's what I mean, to vomit. I should have said it like that. The word was all right, but just misused. See? It was used all right, but just a missound, uh-huh...?... Vomit, \"As a dog returns to its vomit.\"\n\nL-223 If the Assemblies of God, the General Council, organized Pentecost at the first place and got them into that so they could not accept the revelation, don't you know, Oneness, you done the same thing. How could you receive a Message of \"serpent's seed, Eternal security,\" and these other things that's come forth? You're so tightly organized till you won't even let It in your door, uh-huh, uh-huh, same thing Balaam did. But God didn't change His mind.\n\nL-224 So Balaam went over and said, \"Lord, now look, I really got an opportunity now to be somebody. You know I been a nobody, but I got a opportunity to be somebody. What do You say about it now, Lord?\" Now, he should never have said that! He knowed exactly what God said do! [Numbers 22:5-30]\n\nL-225 So do every one of you that's baptized in the name of the \"Father, Son, Holy Ghost,\" on these other issues of the 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min Bible that's supposed to be in this day, you know what to do about It, is accept It! When you see God plainly vindicate \"It's the Truth,\" that's God interpreting His Own Word. But will you do it? No, your organization won't let you do it!\n\nL-226 Many of the ministers there in Tucson that's listening in this morning. Brother Gilmore, I have nothing against you; Brother Brock, First Assembly, and Friendly church. You man, I was there all that time, you wouldn't even let me come in. I... Sure, you couldn't, you can't and remain what you are. You can't accept revelation, 'cause you're denominated. And listen, just as Uzziah was killed because he was under that false inspiration, so is many true Christians losing their experience back in those old dead denominations, because they're putting their hand on the Ark when they're not ordained to do so. Now you can believe It, or not believe It, that's up to you. God's your Judge. God never did take back His Word. What He said the first time, He says for every time. [II Chronicles 26:16-23]\n\nL-227 He told Balaam, \"Don't you go!\" And then Balaam come back, said, \"But Lord, could I go?\" Now look! God said, \"Go on!\" Now, He give him permission to go. There is a permissive will of God, and not the original will of God. You see what a trouble he got into? [Numbers 22:12-20]\n\nL-228 And any man that builds anything, any organization, or anything outside of upon the Word of God, it's shaking sands and will fall! It'll die as sure as anything, because the Word of God is a growing Body of the Bride. You can't have it all foot, all arm, all thigh. These things come in their season.\n\nL-229 And Pentecost, you made it all one thing, therefore you can't accept new revelation. That's the reason you stay right where you're at and die; moves on. (So much, going to wear you out.) But God doesn't change His mind, His first decision is exactly right. So God doesn't change His mind, He just let you go on in your permissive will. \"God's a good God,\" as Oral Roberts says. He's also a fearful God!\n\nL-230 Look, just like you say, \"Glory to God, I want to speak with tongues!\"He'll let you do it, but that ain't no sign you got the Holy Ghost. Remember what Thomas said, the old doubter? \"Unless I have some evidence, got to stick my fingers in His nails, His hands, and in His side, I--I--I--I won't even believe It.\" Now, there you are, the same thing. Jesus said, \"Here you are, Thomas, stick your hands in here then if that's what you want to know.\" See? See? Now, if you're the Thomas, right, go ahead. But what did He say? \"How much greater is their reward who has never seen and yet believe.\" Uh-huh.\n\nL-231 Notice, notice, by doing this, he caused the death of sincere man; putting his hand on the ark when he shouldn't have done, it. A great, sincere man, think the anointing and everything was just right, but the ark was moving in it's wrong way. \"The oxen,\" the Bible said, \"stumbled,\" not the Levites. The oxen stumbled and the cart was being pitched over; and a sincere man, with his heart full of love, put his hand upon the ark to hold it back, and was stricken dead because no man could touch that ark but a Levite. See how God keeps His Word, keeps His channel, keeps His order? Uzziah was smitten with leprosy. Here is David, altogether caused the death of a man, and a great disaster; being anointed with the Spirit, both of them, but out of God's channel. Is that right? He died. Oh, it scared David to death, it called the--the name of the place, as Brother Jack read it. See? He marked him there. [I Chronicles 13:1-14]\n\nL-232 How many times denominations has done the same thing to sincere believers. The Catholic church, the Methodist, the Baptist, Church of Christ, even the Pentecostals, has caused a-many spiritual death with that same thing. When It come, with these things, they found... and they can't go no further, because that's what their denomination believes.\n\nL-233 Look today, the big crusades, same thing. They don't do nothing but make them more a \"twofold child of hell, worse than they was in the first place.\" Makes them harder, really, come to the Truth. Have one of these big revivals, and all of them come in, carry on a little while, and go back out and they start all this sin again. Hear of another revival, say, \"Ah, I had so much stuff; I tried it, there's nothing to it.\" See? They don't know the channel. Don't see.\n\nL-234 I heard our great evangelist Billy Graham, set one morning at a breakfast like this, and he said, \"I...\" Here, he puts up the Bible, in Louisville, Kentucky, said, \"There is God's example.\" And that's true, the man said the truth. He said, \"You go... Paul went into a city and had one convert, come back a year from then had thirty out of that convert.\" Said, 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min \"But I go into a city and have thirty thousand converts, and come back in six months and can't find thirty.\" He said, \"You know what's a matter?\" Said, \"You lazy preachers,\" said \"you set around with your foot upon the desk and--and call these people by phone instead of visiting them after supper and talking to them.\"\n\nL-235 Oh, my heart was burning. I thought, \"O great man of God, I hate to disagree with you here, but who was the lazy preachers on Paul's one convert? What he done, he took him into the Word, he took him into the Message, he took him to where he found God; his heart was on fire, he set the country afire! And only thing you do is put them in a Baptist or Methodist church, or something, no wonder there's nothing to burn.\" Uh-huh. Yes, sir!\n\nL-236 Then look what the Word has promised for today. Let's find out whether it's Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostals, or what, for today. Now you can go to read your Scriptures. Take these Scriptures I've been quoting to you. Also Revelation...\n\nL-237 If I had time, I'd read it, but I just haven't. I got about twelve or fourteen more minutes. I got to close on time, at eleven, if I get out right.\n\nL-238 Notice Malachi 4, Revelation 10, Seven Seals. Didn't the Bible say... Now watch! There was a Angel, a Messenger from above; and a earthly messenger. And each messenger was for the age of the church. He said, \"In the days...\" speaking now, \"there came a angel, messenger\" (word angel, English word means \"messenger\"). \"... came down from Heaven, and He put His foot on the land and sea, and swore by Him that lives forever that time shall be no more.\" Is that right? A rainbow around His head, and all these things just taking place. That Angel was Christ! Certainly! But what did He say? \"But in the days of the seventh angel, the seventh church age.\"\n\nL-239 Always it's right at the end of the church age where they got the thing so... the ecclesiastic so messed up until God sends a messenger, and that's the Message to that church age. Then they take his message, 'cause he just lives a little while, and God... then they take his message instead of carrying it on with the rest of It, they make a--a denomination. And then they come make another denomination; another messenger, take another one.\n\nL-240 You all seen in my book, it'll all be drawed out in The Seven Church Ages, which He told me; which I stand by as a witness to God to be judged at the day of Judgment for It. It come from God, not from my thinking. Notice, here. I thought--I thought different from that, if I was going to have my own thought. Like Brother Jack told me about the Angel there, how that \"That Christ was a glorified body.\" But it wasn't, it was showing that the Message being right, the Supreme Deity, He was God. See? Just the very thing I had been preaching from the Word. The Word always bears record of the Word. Now, quickly now, as we are fixing to close in a few moments.\n\nL-241 Now, He said, \"In the days of the Message of the seventh angel, the earthly angel, seventh church age, then all these mysteries that's been lost back through these other six church ages should be revealed right then.\" Well, that's exactly what those Angels said. Here is the Seven Seals, or the opening of these mysteries. And you try to get It before those denominations. Contrary to what they... Brother, they close up like a clam, but they've always done it. But it's season! [Revelation 3:14-21]\n\nL-242 How many knows that this is the seventh church age? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen!\"--Ed.] The Laodicean Age, a lukewarm that God spues out of His mouth. And they spue God out of their mouth; there's not another age in the Bible where Jesus was found on the outside trying to knock, get back in. They put Him out, no cooperation. Who is Jesus? The Word! The Word was put out. The husks throwed out the wheat! He said, \"I stand at the door and knock, and any man in those shackles out there will hear My Voice.\" O God, have mercy! [Revelation 3:14-21]\n\nL-243 It was at then, when that man died, that David with the anointing saw what he had done wrong. O David, you pastor, can't you see your dead creeds and denominations you're holding on to? Can't you see what it's doing? It's killing a Uzziah. Spiritually dead, and you wonder why there ain't no revival; letting your women cut their hair, paint their face, wear shorts; send your boys away to ricky schools, and so forth like that, where half of them comes home homosexuals, and everything. 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min\n\nL-244 Notice David's objective: he was bringing the ark to his own house. That wasn't the capitol, that wasn't the place, it belonged in Jerusalem. But David was bringing it to his own house, he wanted the revival to be on his own denomination. \"Oh, if you're Assembly, all right. If you're Oneness, all right. If you're Pentecostal, okay.\"\n\nL-245 Like somebody said, said, \"Brother Branham, how you ever have anybody to listen to you?\" Said, \"I can see Billy Graham, he's got every denomination in the country with him. I can see Oral Roberts, every Pentecostal hangs right to him. But,\" said \"you're against the whole thing.\" Uh-huh. Said, \"How in the world do you ever get anybody?\" I said, \"It's God!\"\n\nL-246 \"I the Lord hath planted it before the foundation of the world. I'll water it day and night unless some of them should pluck it from My hand,\" Isaiah. \"I'll water, I planted it. I put their names on the Book before the foundation of the world, by predestination. I'll water it, just keep on moving. I'll furnish the water, you just spray It out.\" Right. See? \"I'll water it day and night unless one of them gets plucked out of My hand.\" There you are.\n\nL-247 Want It come to the city of David, the city of Jerusalem. There was no place ready for it at that time, and so is it today. These great mysteries that's been unfolded by the Seven Seals, there's not a place in any denomination... would have to quit being a denomination to take It. All the way from Luther on down to the Pentecostal Oneness, there's not a place can receive It. Neither can a man receive It and stay in his denomination. He'll have to follow the wheat or go with the shuck, either one he wants to.\n\nL-248 Christ is our Ark, the Word. They want their denomination. He cannot, notice, cannot be carried on the new carts of the denominations, His Message cannot go on the cart of a new denomination when It's supposed to be bore and come on the heart of a prophet. It cannot. He promised it, It would be thus, and that's the way It must be. [I Chronicles 15:14-15]\n\nL-249 So the denomination will never receive It, neither can they receive It. And they're just as blinded to It as the Jews was when they hung Jesus to the cross, when Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, they don't even know what they're doing.\" Don't despise them, but just pray. For what if you was in that same condition with your eyes so blind that you can't wake up and see what's going on?\n\nL-250 Neither could they see that That was their very God. When He was hanging there on the cross, and them singing the 22nd Psalm in the temple, two hundred yards away, \"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me? They pierced My feet and My hands.\" See? \"All My bones, they stare at Me. Why has Thou forsaken Me?\" And there, the very God that they had sung about, blind enough to have Him tacked to the cross, and didn't know it. [Psalms 22:1, 6-11, 13-19]\n\nL-251 Now, don't the Bible say that the Laodicean church, that thinks that she's so great by her denominational members, she'd be \"naked, miserable, poor, blind, and don't know it\"? What does the blind mean? The blind means for this Laodicean church like it did the ending of the Jewish church, blind to the very Christ that they had on the outside, knocking, trying to get in; \"naked, miserable, poor, wretched, blind, and don't know it.\" O God of mercy! [Revelation 3:14-21]\n\nL-252 Why can't the wheat lay out in the Presence, that Son Light, to see the hour we're living in? Yes, Christ is our Ark, but His original way to do it. Then here He is... They had His Spirit all right, we know that. They wait upon the Lord, see His plan on His original Word in Its season to be vindicated, that's what we should be doing right now. And He--He reveals their faith by His Word, seeing Him confirm every plan that He promised, not man's schemes of denomination, not making members for our own ark.\n\nL-253 They got a Methodist ark, a Baptist ark, a Presbyterian ark, everybody's going into this ark for the great tribulation coming; \"Glory to God! I was baptized in the Methodist ark, the Presbyterian, the Pentecostal ark.\" There's only one Ark, that's Jesus Christ, and He is the Word!\n\nL-254 Notice, God told the prophet, said, \"Eat the scroll,\" in the Old Testament. The prophet of the New Testament, He said, \"Eat the little book.\" Why? That the prophet and the Word would be one! See? That's the Ark, the Word of God. [Revelation 10:9]\n\nL-255 God has promised His Word, how It would be fulfilled and how It would come to pass when He chose His Bride, 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min how it would be done. It's happening right before you, in the Name of the Lord, and that's by the original Word! The evening-time Message is here. [Zechariah 14:7]\n\nL-256 How many remembers Haywood when he wrote: It shall be Light about the evening time, The path to Glory you will surely find.\n\nL-257 Yes, the evening promise of the Seven Seals, of Revelation 10, Malachi 4, Luke 30 and 10. Read Deuteronomy 4, 4: 1 and 4, then 25th and 26th verse, and see what He said about for this last day. This was Moses saying to Israel to \"Keep every Word, don't you add one thing!\" Moses, that prophet had been up there and seen that Word of God. And It was wrote out to him and a-vindicated by God's Own hand writing It. He said, \"You keep every Word, don't you add one thing to It or take one thing from It.\" You can read that in the 25th and 26th verse of Deuteronomy 4. [Revelation 10:1-7], [Luke 17:30], [Deuteronomy 4:1-4, 25-26], [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-258 Notice! Don't you add to It, don't you take away from It; 'cause if you do, God will take your part from the Book of Life. And it shows that you wasn't His seed.\" [Revelation 22:18-19]\n\nL-259 Remember! Everything that God has promised us, everything that God's spoke to us, everything that's been told to you in the Name of the Lord, it has happened! God has never made one promise null, but He's kept every promise that He said, has told us, has been the Truth for these twenty years, Shreveport. I've preached to you through the power of God, and the courtesy of your pastor, and I take you to record today. Even to women passed bearing; man, children, afflictions, healing, prophesy, things that would happen, not one of them has ever failed! Now, stay away from those denominations, they're leading you to death.\n\nL-260 Samuel stood one day, and they said, \"We want a king, we want to be like the rest of the world.\" Well, Samuel said, \"Don't take that king. He'll take your sons, and daughters, and he'll do this and do that.\" He said, \"Yeah, I know you're right.\" [I Samuel 8:4-22]\n\nL-261 But Samuel said, \"Listen to me. Did I ever take any of your money? Did I ever beg you for a living? Did I ever tell you you had to give me so much salary to hold a meeting for you?\" Now judge yourselves, even now! See? He said, \"Did I ever tell you anything in the Name of the Lord but what come to pass?\" Not one thing. [I Samuel 12:3-5]\n\nL-262 \"Oh, yes, Samuel, you never did beg us for money, you never did want big things. Samuel, that's true, and everything you told us in the Name of the Lord come to pass. But, Samuel, we want our denomination anyhow!\" \"Then go take it. It's up to you.\" That's right. [I Samuel 12:3-5]\n\nL-263 You can think you're doing God a service, and if you're going out of God's way of doing it, you're going to keep messing it up, on and on. O church of the living God! Please forgive my Irish way and my sense of humor, but in the sincerity and sacredness of my heart, you Assemblies of God, you Oneness, Presbyterian, Methodist, whatever you are, flee for your life. Remember, get out from there. Nations are breaking, Israel's awakening, (getting ready for that remnant) The signs that the prophets foretold; The denominational days are numbered with harrows encumbered, Return, O dispersed, to your own. The day of redemption is near, Man's hearts are failing for fear, Be filled with His Spirit, Have your lamps trimmed and clear, Look up, your redemption is near.\n\nL-264 Do you believe that? We're at the end time, we're here. The handwriting's on the wall, the second Coming is at hand, the Bride is being chosen, watered, drawed out.\n\nL-265 Now, that don't mean drawed out from church, that means drawed out from denominationalism. You must go to church, but don't join any organization. Jesus went with all the organizations, but He never joined a one of them. 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min Neither did He side with any of them, no indeed, but He was among them. There's where the Light's got to be scattered. And you stay right where you are, scattering the Light. See? That's what God's using you for. A hungry-hearted people, let them know that Jesus Christ is real, just the same as He was yesterday, He is today; and will be forever.\n\nL-266 It is possible, a man or woman with all sincerity, trying their best to do God a service, and stirred it in the wrong way. With a genuine anointing of the Holy Spirit upon them, but stirred it contrary to God's plan for the age, and chaos the whole thing. Now, if you believe that's the Truth, say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen!\"--Ed.] We just read It. Chaos the whole thing by not coming God's provided way to do it. Let us pray.\n\nL-267 O church, here and across the nation, listen to your humble servant this morning. Will you? Look where you were at a few years ago when this first started; now look what impersonations has capitalized on It, and great millions and billions of dollars has flown into the organizations. See? Still away from the Word of God. Buildings and organizations is not the way God stirs His Spirit. He stirs It right into His Word, to make It live. And if you were ordained from the beginning of the earth to that Word, every Word will come right on top of the Word. Like a human cell will not have one human cell, and the next the cell of a dog, and the next the cell of a cat; it'll be human cells. But it's got to have a cell first to start with. Is that right? say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Well, if it is the Word cell to start with, the other Word cells are ordained to make it a full body.\n\nL-268 Don't be children, only in love, but be man in Spirit and in judgment. Judge ye whether I've told you the Truth or not. Judge ye whether It's the Word of God or not. Judge ye whether it's the hour we're talking about or not. Judge ye whether these things are promised. Now, are they vindicated? By things that there's not a human being in the world could do it. But It's become so common to us till we're letting It flow right on a-past us. Wait, church, wait.\n\nL-269 If there's one in here this morning that doesn't know Jesus Christ, doesn't stand justified this morning, your sins all gone as though you never had sinned, and you want to be that way... 'cause remember, one day, maybe today, maybe in the next five minutes, but one day that heart's going to stop. And that inside of the inside is going to take its flight to stand in the Presence of God to be judged according to what you do with this Message this morning, according to this Message that you see. Not... It ain't me, I'm just a mouthpiece. Like this microphone, it can't say a thing 'less I'm talking in it. And neither could I say anything unless God was talking through it, but you see God's vindicated it to be the Truth. You want to be a real Christian.\n\nL-270 Now, we have no place for an altar call, but right at the table where you're setting. The place is packed and jammed, overflowed. I couldn't call you to an altar, there's no altar here to call you to. But the altar is in your heart. Won't you let that little conviction that \"Jesus Christ is real\" move right up close today and call the rest of His body to you, manger Him in your heart? If He isn't there, would you raise your hand, and a sign to Him, saying, \"Lord, fill me, fill me with Your Word and with Your Presence, that I might live by You\"?\n\nL-271 While every head is bowed, every eye closed, all across the nation, raise your hands here in the visible audience and out there too; and I'll offer prayer for you. That's all I can do, I cannot fill it. God bless you. I cannot fill it. God bless you; and you. God can fill it. God bless you. Hands are going up here in the visible audience, everywhere. \"Fill it. Fill me, O Lord. Fill me.\" And now, after I... Thank you, sister. Thank you, brother. God bless you. After I... God bless you, sister dear. You. After... I think now I've caught the most of the sincere, trying to be, I want to raise my hands with you.\n\nL-272 O Lord, never let me come to a standstill. Continually, Lord, let me not stop at one thing, let me just move on, Lord, till I've completed everything that You ordained for me to do. Regardless of the price, regardless of the cost, regardless of the critizism, how hard the cross is, I'll remember the cross that You bore. So this consecrated cross I'll bear Until death shall set me free; Then go home, a crown to wear, There's a crown for me. Must Jesus bear the cross alone, 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min And all the world go free? No, there's a cross for every one of His sons, There's a cross for me.\n\nL-273 Dear God, the Word has gone forth. It cannot return void, It'll find Its place somewhere. If the seed has already been planted, It'll water it till it grows. And none can pluck it from Your hand, \"All the Father has given Me will come to Me, no man can pluck them out of My hand. My Father has given them to Me before the foundation of the world\"; when the plans were all drawed up, as so, Jesus was given His Church, His Bride.\n\nL-274 The bogus marriage of the world, to these denominations. You came and died into the world, You redeemed Her, You justified Her, She never did it at the first place. She was trapped into it, blind. And as the song says: I once was lost and now I'm found, I was once in Laodicea, blind, but now I see. And it's grace that taught my heart to fear, It was grace my fears relieved; How precious did that grace appear The hour I first believed. And the water of God fell upon my soul. I was parching.\n\nL-275 God, at this little altar of every heart present here and around the nation, may the waters from under the altar of God gush out this morning upon Your Church; and water it, Lord, for the season's just about finished. Give it Life, the Waters of Life, that it might be able to lay in the Presence of the Son to be ripened for Your great garner.\n\nL-276 Father, I pray for them. But the stalk must dry, so I cannot pray for it; it must die, so it is dead. But I pray for the wheat, Lord, that's forming into the Body of Christ. Grant, Lord, that the fresh waters of God will keep Its cheeks bathed with tears of joy and understanding until the combine comes to take it Home. In Jesus' Name, I commit it all to You, Lord; the results is Yours. Amen.\n\nL-277 [A sister in congregation gives a message--Ed.] Amen.\n\nL-278 So Father, God, we thank You. And, Father, we pray for our little sister, handsmaid here, for her strength. I'm thinking of a time that when I--I walked in the presence of her, how that the Spirit came upon her and gave the same message that the Angel of the Lord gave on the River that day: \"As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of the Lord Jesus, you are sent to forerun the second.\"\n\nL-279 Seeing it shaping up now into the wheat part, God, we thank You for everything You've done. Our hearts are filled beyond speaking. I feel so full, Lord, I just don't know how to say anything else. But thank You Father, again, for all that You have done for us. Through Jesus Christ's Name. I love Him,... Let's just sing to Him, now. Remember, He's here. Because He first loved me, And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree.\n\nL-280 Does it make you feel real little, real little? All emptied out, just ready for the Spirit, see. Hold to God's unchanging hand! Hold to God's unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God's unchanging hand! Covet not this world's vain riches, That so rapidly decay, Build your hopes on things Eternal, (no denomination, now) Hold to God's unchanging hand! 65-1127B, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will, Washington Youree Hotel, Shreveport, LA, 37 min Hold to God's unchanging hand! Hold to God's unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God's unchanging hand!\n\nL-281 How many is trying to do that? Raise your hand. Now reach right across the table, put your hands in one anothers' hands, like this. Together... You can be seated, that's all right, or whatever you want to do. Listen closely. Let's sing it together now. This represents our unbroken chain of the love of God. We're holding one anothers' hands because we believe in God. We touch each other because we're brothers and sisters, the same vibrating Spirit, the Eternal Word of God dwelling in our hearts being made manifest. When our journey is completed, If to God we have been true, Fair and bright our home in Glory, Our enraptured soul shall view! Hold to God's unchanging hand! Hold to God's unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God's unchanging hand! (Spirit of the Lord!) Hold to God... Just get your mind on Him, see. This is the kind of meetings we must set in in the future. ... unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, (The Word is the only thing that is Eternal.) Hold to God's unchanging hand! Covet not this world's vain popularity, education, That so rapidly decay, (Look at it today, what it's done.) Seek to gain the heavenly treasure, They will never pass away! Hold to God's unchanging hand! Hold to God's unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God's unchanging hand!\n\nL-282 [A sister speaks in another tongue. Brother Branham begins humming Hold To God's Unchanging Hand. Another sister gives an interpretation--Ed.]\n\nL-283 How we thank You, Lord. As we set in this solemn moment, almost like a funeral, for we're facing the burial of a dying, dead world; a dying, dead church. O God, gather Your wheat quickly, Father. Come quickly, Lord Jesus.\n\nL-284 Bless Thy people, Father, bring sincerity and deepness to the hearts of the people. May we get off of those fragile bubble dances, settle down into the deep riches of the honey of God. Grant it, Lord. Keep our hearts established with love and sincerity.\n\nL-285 Bless Thy people everywhere, Father. As we leave this place may we go in the Name of the Lord Jesus to speak that which is sincere, that which is Truth, that which is right, may we shun that what's wrong, Lord. When a man begins to lie to us, may we quickly turn our back upon him, turn our back to all dirty, filthy jokes and things of the world, and just turn our back and walk away. Help us, dear God. Mold us, make us, break us, and make us into the images of sons and daughters of God that we might act with the virtue of the Holy Spirit. We commit ourself to You, with our hands in each others', in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's stand.

It's good to be back again tonight. Thankful we have this opportunity again now to serve the Lord. And after keeping you so long last night, I feel it wouldn't be fair to keep you long again tonight.\n\nL-2 Just back there listening to an associate brother of ours, in the Lord, that just come from Indiana, stirred by a strange dream. He's never be in Shreveport before, in his life. But he dreamed, the other night, that he come to Shreveport, not by his car. And he come with a... or come somewhere, to a church where I was speaking. He said, after I had preached and prayed for the people, said, \"'Something's going to happen.'\" Said, he \"was back the next day.\" And he said, he \"knew the building, how it looked.\" Said, \"There's a--there was a civic auditorium across the street, but they never went in the auditorium.\" Said, \"It was on this side, in a stone building that had a wing to it, and the building set just like this.\" And the--the boy is a dreamer, I've seen his dreams and know that they're true.\n\nL-3 And he said--and he said, \"Then on the last night\" that I \"was speaking and praying for the sick.\" And I said, \"'Something's fixing to happen.' And sounded like a clap of thunder.\" And said, \"The people begin screaming.\" And said, \"As the thunder begin to go away, well,\" said \"It made a voice, and begin speaking.\" Says, \"That speaking was going on, that through these lattices (windows up here) come the Glory of God, moving in, in the form of the Pillar of Fire.\" He's never seen It. He's heard us talk about It, but he's never seen It himself. And said, \"There It was, come through the windows up like that, and formed that Light like you see in the picture, right above the audience here.\" And said, \"It was rumbling off something.\" And said, I \"stood, and said, 'That is Jehovah God.'\"\n\nL-4 And said he \"was reminded of (when thinking about It) when Moses called the... brought the people out of Egypt. And they said, 'Let Moses speak, and not God, lest we die.'\"\n\nL-5 He said, \"Everybody was laying on the floor, their hands up, screaming.\" Said he \"was screaming, too, 'Lord God, I love You! I love You!'\" And his wife shook him and woke him up.\n\nL-6 See him going down the aisle right now, Brother Jackson, a former Methodist preacher. And he was so disturbed, till he come down; and said when he walked in, he \"was so astounded,\" just exactly the way he had saw it in a dream. I don't know what it means. The Lord's kept it from me. But something could happen, seeing Brother Jackson dreamed that, knowing him as an honest, real--real man, servant of God.\n\nL-7 And I--I know of him dreaming dreams, coming to me, and the Lord give me an interpretation, it'd be just perfectly like that. Even to, one time, my going to Arizona, he had the dream of it.\n\nL-8 And he's very much disturbed. He's with his wife, he brought her. She's to be mother right away, and the only way he could go was by airplane. He didn't have a penny to come, and somebody give him the money. And so it's kinda worked out mysteriously, so something could happen; we hope so. We don't know just what the Lord will provide for us.\n\nL-9 Now, we are grateful to the Lord to be living in the day that we're living in, just before the coming of Jesus. As I have said before, it's the greatest time of all history. I'd rather be living right now than any time, to... on earth.\n\nL-10 I see here in front of us, again tonight, is my good friend, Brother Dauch. I mentioned him in the auditorium this morning. Brother Dauch is ninety-three years old today, how blessed it is. He contributes his long life to the glory and praise of God, ninety-three today. \"Happy Birthday\" to you, my brother! And I know out, down, around the country where they're listening in tonight, they also wish Brother Bill Dauch a \"Happy Birthday.\" He's a very personal friend of Oral Roberts, many, has helped so many in the Gospel way, and everything. He's a great friend of ours.\n\nL-11 Glad to see Brother Mann here, another Methodist preacher, saved and baptized with the Holy Ghost, and in the Name of Jesus Christ, setting here. He's, also, one of our associates from Indiana. And I understand Brother Hickerson's setting here by him, one of our deacons from Jeffersonville, Indiana (they're listening in up there tonight). And I understand that Brother Wheeler, one of the other deacons are here somewhere. And I--I haven't located him just 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min yet, somebody pointing their fingers over and I'll catch him after a bit; setting over, way over to the right, yes. Brother Banks Woods, if you're listening in tonight, your brother was here last night. I seen him as I went out, Brother Lyle. Jehovah Witness; the whole group was converted. Lyle was brought in because a vision of the Lord.\n\nL-12 Lyle was setting in the boat there that day, when the day before it was told him that \"something\" was \"going to happen concerning a resurrection of life.\" He was a real Jehovah Witness, too! But that morning, setting there, fishing, and he caught... Well, he had a great, big ol' (that Kentucky fashion, you know)... a big hook and a little, bitty fish swallowed it. And he just pulled gills, entrails and all out, throwed it out on the water (little, bitty sunfish), and he said, \"Well, little fellow, you shot your last wad.\" The little... flipping along on the water, died, the wind blowed him up into some pond lilies.\n\nL-13 And the day before, setting, I said, \"The Holy Spirit tells me that 'there'll be a resurrection of some little creature.' Perhaps there'd be a--a kitten, when I get back home, 'cause just...\"\n\nL-14 When we was trying to dig some fish bait, Brother Woods and I, who's listening in tonight, my little girl which is a young woman setting here, engaged to this lanky soldier (I see him), she come up, she said, \"Daddy...\" Her and the other little girl, said, \"We...\" Now, anybody can have any kind of pet they want, but I sure don't like a cat, so she... or no Branham. So we... she said, \"Oh, we found a poor ol' cat out here, Daddy. It's--it--it's eat something and it's... somebody's poisoned it, it's all swelled up.\" Said, \"Daddy, it's going to die right away, can we get a little box and keep it a couple days?\"\n\nL-15 I said, \"Let me see the cat.\" Well, they went and got the cat. I seen what was going to happen, so give her a box. And next morning, was about seven or eight kittens there, you know. So my little boy, Joe, picked one of them up, and squeezed it and dropped it on the ground; and just--just... little fellow lay there wiggling around and around, killed it.\n\nL-16 And I said to Brother Lyle, his brother, I said, \"You know, it may be that it'd be that little kitten raised up, like we have seen the Lord do things.\"\n\nL-17 Brother Lyle, just new in the way. The Holy Spirit had just told him he was married, and what he had done, and the evils he had done, the things he had done. Well, he thought Brother Banks was telling me them things. But when It really brought him right out, and told him what he done the night before, that was--that was too much for him. He couldn't get it.\n\nL-18 Then, the next morning... While we fished all night, with little fish, we was catching some for bait. But he just throwed that little fish in the water, quivered, flabbed over. About a half hour later we were setting there, and I was... I said, \"Brother Lyle, you let the fish swallow the hook all the way down in his stomach. See?\" I said, \"Take the fly line here, flip it over, the bait out like that; just soon as he touch it,\" I said \"then just hold him and then bring him in.\" I said, \"He... don't pull him out like that, don't swallow it, you catch the fish.\" He said, \"Well...\" He had a great, big ol' line hanging over, said, \"This is the way we do it,\" like that.\n\nL-19 So, just about that time, I heard Something coming off the top of the mountain up there, a whirlwind, whirling around and around. Here It come down like that, and the Spirit of God come over the boat, said, \"Stand up on your feet.\" Said, \"Speak to that dead fish. Say, 'I give you back your life.'\"\n\nL-20 And that little fish had been laying there for a half hour, with his entrails in its mouth, and its gills. I said, \"Little fishy, Jesus Christ gives you back your life. Live, in the Name of Jesus Christ.\" Flipped over on his back, and down through the water he went as hard as he could go.\n\nL-21 Brother Lyle, are you here somewhere? I--I seen you last night. Whether he's inside, outside, or where he's at, raise your hand if I can see you. [Someone in congregation says, \"Balcony\"--Ed.] What say? In the bal-... Oh, yes, way up in the balcony, through the windows back there. That's the man, a Jehovah Witness.\n\nL-22 He said, \"Brother Branham!\" He was all excited, he said, \"Uh, it's--it's good to be here. Isn't it?\" He said, \"Uh-uh, do you--do you... Uh, do you think that meant me, that--that--that, that I called that little fish, said, 'You had shot your last wad'?\" Said, \"That--that--that meant something for me?\" 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min I said, \"Nah, nah, just a confirmation.\" He was all upset about it.\n\nL-23 Well, we travel along and you see those things happening, knowing... Now, just think, what was it to show? I had a-many little spastic child on my prayer list, praying for it, but when the vision come it was for a little ol' fish about so long, about two inches long or three. Looked like the hook was as big as the fish. But what it was, was to show you that God looks on the little things too. See?\n\nL-24 One day when lepers was laying all over the country, He used His power and put a curse on a tree. It begin to wither, when there was people laying everywhere needing that healing power. But, you see, He wanted to show He's God over everything, whether it's small, whether it's big, whatever it is. He's still God over all things, all the creation. So we love Him because... That--that gives us to know, if He's interested to speak the Word of life into a little insignificant fish laying there dead, on the water for a half hour, He can certainly someday speak Life into His children. No matter if your body be no more than a spoonful of dust, He'll speak, and we'll answer Him someday. He's God who's interested in everything, all that we do, all that we say, everything. He's interested. Now let us bow our heads, everywhere. [Matthew 21:19], [I Thessalonians 4:16]\n\nL-25 I wonder now, before we pray, if there's anybody tonight that's interested in Him, but yet you haven't got your reservations yet for the other Land where we're going to see Him. You know, you can't come in without reservations. And you haven't made them yet, but you would like to be remembered in prayer now, that everything will be made right between you and God tonight, would you just raise up your hand; you'll say, \"Remember me, Lord\"? You're... just let Him see your hand. God, grant it. [Matthew 22:1-3]\n\nL-26 Heavenly Father, as we stand tonight between the living and the dead; and these things that's happening in these days, mysterious, sure they're mysterious; but God, You know whether they are true or not, You are the solemn Judge of the heavens and earth. And we say this, Lord, just to encourage the people (some of the things that Thou has showed us), that they might be encouraged to love You and believe You, serve You, and to know that no matter how little the deed is, good or bad, You see it. I pray, dear God, that You'll bless every one of those hands tonight, and the soul and spirit that motivated that hand to go up. And I pray, God, that this will be the night that their reservations will be made for that Land beyond the river. Grant it. [Hebrews 4:12]\n\nL-27 Heal the sick and the afflicted, Lord, both here, all out across the land where the--the--the broadcast through the phones are coming in. Bless those out there that's unsaved, all the way from California to New York, from Canada to Mexico. Grant, Lord, that every person under the sound of our voice, tonight, will be saved from their sins, healed of their sickness, because of Your Divine Presence. [Matthew 10:7-8]\n\nL-28 And this our Brother Jackson, who's flown all the way down this thousand miles here, to be here because something strangely stirred his heart; \"And they shall dream dreams, and see visions.\" Dear God, Thou hast kept it a secret from me, what this means; I don't know. But if You shall visit us, Lord, prepare our hearts now for that visit. That we might be under expectations, not knowing what You will do, and not knowing if You have promised to visit us by this dream; we do not know. But we are--are just quoting those things that we do understand, that You promised to visit your people, and we pray that You'll make Yourself real to us here. In the Name of Jesus Christ we asked it. Amen. [Acts 2:17], [Matthew 18:20]\n\nL-29 Now, tonight, after keeping you so long last night and this morning, and I kinda getting a little bit hoarse. I got a little piece of hair I got, I wear over my bald spot here when I'm preaching. But I forgot it this time, and this air, sweeping through these windows, is begin to give me a--a little bit of hoarseness. I used to... I'd have to close meetings, but since I got that, then I don't bother with it no more, I just go on. And I forgot it, and it's... I've... kinda can feel it, so your prayers will be appreciated. And now, these are two services each day, that they are... kinda get... You know, when you got a lot of miles, it... you can tell it.\n\nL-30 So now to you people in California, and out in Arizona, we all send greetings across the nation. Brother Leo and the group that's waiting on the Lord up at Prescott, invited now, and all you people around Phoenix, a week from tonight, we're to be over in Yuma at the banquet. They done sold out all their tickets over there and got a bigger 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min auditorium, and they can't place the people. So come early, you all, to--to get in. Then we're going on into Los Angeles from there, next Monday... next Sunday, Sunday night. And so we're looking to see you all over there. God's rich blessings rest on you all.\n\nL-31 To you in New York, and you that are around up in Ohio and different places, soon I want to preach the message of The Trail Of The Serpent (the beast at the beginning, and the beast at the end), at the Tabernacle. Billy will send you a note for that, when we're going to speak it, 'cause I do that in the Tabernacle because it'll, at least, be four hours or more long.\n\nL-32 So now... so I want you here, here and wherever you are now, to turn to the Book of Job. Very strange Book to preach from, but I want to just use a few notes here now.\n\nL-33 And then, tomorrow morning, here at the tabernacle, there'll be Sunday School services at... We start here at what time? [A man says, \"Nine-thirty.\"--Ed.] Nine-thirty. And then I have the privilege of speaking here again tomorrow. And the Lord willing, I wanted to speak on the subject... if He's willing, now, as I was studying this afternoon, to show you that, \"There's only one place that God will meet a worshipper.\" Uh-huh, only... And--and can tell you what that place is, and what the Name of that place is, where God will meet the worshipper.\n\nL-34 And then, tomorrow night, I'm going to ask a favor, that is, for a healing service. And I--I want an old-fashioned healing service. And if the Lord willing, I want to speak on a subject that alarmed me today... When Brother Moore and I were talking out together, my precious brethren, we were discussing Scriptures. And how lovely it was to be with them brothers, like old times. And he said, \"You know, Brother Branham, all the preaching you ever done for us here in Shreveport, The Lamb And The Dove was one of the most outstanding messages you ever brought us here at Shreveport.\" Said, \"I guess with your Message so strenuous to you today, you never get to one like that.\"\n\nL-35 \"When I miss That, I miss my Message.\" Love is my dear dying Lamb, Thy precious Blood Shall never lose its power, Till all the ransomed church of God Be saved, to sin no more. Ever since by faith, I saw that stream Thy flowing wounds supplying, Redeeming love has been my theme, And shall be till I die.\n\nL-36 Tomorrow night, if it be the will of the Lord, I want to preach on a subject on: On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove. Tomorrow night, \"The Lord coming down on the wings of a Dove,\" that is, if the Lord willing, my voice don't get too bad. Now... so, pray for us.\n\nL-37 And then I want an old-fashioned prayer meeting like we had at the beginning, no discernment, just simply give everybody a card that wants to be prayed for. Now, you must have a card, so be here early so Billy can give you a card and keep it lined up. If you don't do that, people just keep doubling back, and doubling back, and doubling back, and there's no end to the line. Anybody can have a card. I want Brother Jack to stand by me at the prayer line, like you use to, and Brother Brown to bring the people to me instead of Billy Paul. I--I--I--I want--I want an old-fashioned prayer line, and we'll just pray the way we used to years ago.\n\nL-38 I'm glad tonight to have another associate brother with us, just looked around and recognized then and seen him, a few minutes ago, Brother Gordon Lindsay. He's one of the old timers, was with us a long time ago. Doing a great job, printing, he's printing my book now: The--The Seven Church Ages. We hope to have it ready again, The Seven Seals. If he happens to read that before he prints it, we're going to have a theological discussion. I can just feel it coming. But he knows I'm no theologian. So... But we're looking forward to tomorrow night. If you're in, Brother Lindsay, be here tomorrow night. If you are, drop around and be with us on the platform for an old-fashioned prayer meeting.\n\nL-39 How many would like to see one of them old-timers again, where we bring the people up? That'll be fine. Now, 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min bring out your sick and afflicted, tomorrow night, for that purpose then.\n\nL-40 Now, if you got the Book of Job, the 42nd verse... or 42nd chapter, and the first six verses of the 42nd chapter of Job; very strange. Brother Ted Dudley, if you are listening in tonight, over in Phoenix, you remember you and I talking one time, about a week or two ago, and we referred to this? I told you, \"Someday that would become a text to me.\" And I want to use it tonight. Then answered... Then Job answered the LORD, and said, Listen close to this reading now. I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no doubt can be witholden from thee. Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes. [Job 42:1-6]\n\nL-41 Now I want to take a text from that 5th verse. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now my eye seeth thee. [Job 42:5] May the Lord bless His Word.\n\nL-42 Job, let's take a little of his life. Job was a prophet. He was a man that lived back before the Bible was written. It's been thought that Job was one of the oldest Books of the Bible, because It was written before Genesis was written. Job, this great warrior and prophet, was a--a mighty man in his day. No doubt that he had been brought up and had served the Lord all of his life. And had lived such a gallant life to the people, all had respects for him.\n\nL-43 But he'd come to a place to where he calls it here, being tempted of the Lord. But I'd like to use the word, being \"tested\" by the Lord. And truly, \"Every son that cometh to God must first be tested, tried, child-trained.\" And then if the testing gets hard, and we think it's too hard and won't listen (take heed), then He said we \"become a illegitimate child, and not a child of God.\" Because, there's nothing can move a real, borned-again child of God away from his Parent, see, he's part of Him. You can no more deny it, you deny yourself. See, you've had the experience, you've been trained and tested. [I Peter 1:2-8]\n\nL-44 And now, this man being a prophet, he had had access to God's grace, but Job didn't have a Bible to read. He... the Bible wasn't wrote then, but he had access to God by revelation and by vision. That was before the Bible was written.\n\nL-45 Now, we find out, and take some of his life, when God blessed him and made him a great man. Why, even everybody respected him, even to his wisdom, had become so great. His inspiration from God had vindicated him to be God's servant, so plainly, until the people come from everywhere to hear him. And then Satan begin to accuse that man. And that's the way he does every inspired servant of God, Satan is always there to accuse him of everything that he does that's not right. [Job 1:8-11], [Job 2:3-5]\n\nL-46 And, now, we find out his life and trials, and his great faith. Even Jesus, when He came on the earth, He referred to the patience of Job. He said, \"Have you not read of the patience of Job?\" Faith waits with patience for the promised Word to be fulfilled. [James 5:11], [Hebrews 11:1]\n\nL-47 Now, we notice here that Job, after he went through his trials, all of his afflictions... He had a lovely family, they were taken from him. He had good health, it was taken from him. Everything that he owned in this life was taken. And he set on a ashheap, with a piece of crock, scraping his boils. And even to his own wife, spoke against him, she said, \"Why not curse God, and die?\" [Job 2:7-10]\n\nL-48 He said, \"Thou speakest like a foolish woman.\" He said, \"The Lord gave, and the Lord taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord!\" [Job 2:7-10]\n\nL-49 Now, Satan had come up before God, 'cause he could come before God, and accused the Christians (or, the believers) all the time. So he accused Job of many things, and said that \"Job, the reason he could serve God, because 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min everything was coming good for him.\" But said, \"If You'll just let me have him, in my hands, I'll make him curse You to Your face.\" [Job 1:8-11]\n\nL-50 I want you to notice that the confidence that God had in a believer. See? He's... In other words, God said to Job... or said to Satan, like this, \"You can't do it! He's a just man justified. He is a good man. He... there's not one like him in the whole earth.\" O what a man; that God Himself would say to His enemy, \"My servant is so perfect, there's not another man on earth like him.\" Oh! If we could only be that kind of a man! That God could bestow that confidence upon us! That know that we'll not twist from His Word or His Being, any way! Stay exactly, and He can put His trust in us. [Job 1:6-10]\n\nL-51 Now, Job was a man that carried out God's commandments to the letter, exactly. And Satan knew that, but he said, \"If You'll just let me have him, I'll make him curse You to Your face.\"\n\nL-52 So God told him, He said, \"Now, he's in your hands, but don't you take his life.\" And Satan even stretched as far as he could on that. He took every friend, and everything he had, almost his complete life, but he couldn't take his life. But Job still held right on, there was no turning back. [Job 1:6-12]\n\nL-53 You see, when a man or a person has once really come in contact with God, with that genuine, revealed faith that \"God is!\" There's nothing, no time, no where, can ever separate that man from his God. I believe it was Paul said, \"There's no strife, no hunger, no perils, neither living creatures, or death, or anything that can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus.\" You are securely anchored in Him because you were ordained to that Life. [Romans 8:39]\n\nL-54 But Satan thought he could twist him around a little bit, and cuff him up, and make him do it. But, you see, Job with his perfect revelation of God, and who God was, and how God loved him, he waited! No matter what the circumstances was, he waited for his faith to be confirmed, because he had had a grip on God, a revelation. That I spoke of last night.\n\nL-55 Now, when the sick people that's in the building, the crippled people, or you that have a need of God, when you can get that type of a revelation that you are \"justified,\" when you are actually justified in asking the thing that you're asking for, and believe that \"He is a rewarder of those that diligently seek after Him,\" there's nothing can ever separate you from that faith that's anchored to you. See? But, first, it has to be revealed to you. [Hebrews 11:6]\n\nL-56 Someone come not long ago, a group of man, some of them listening in tonight, and told me, said... I kept telling them, \"Go to Kentucky, oil's down there.\" I knew it was, I seen it in a vision.\n\nL-57 Well, Brother Demos and them didn't go for a long time. After while, finally, they said... After Texas had moved in. And they said, \"Now we're going down.\" I said, \"You ought to a-went a long time ago.\" But they didn't do it.\n\nL-58 Demos said, \"I made a great mistake in that, by not doing that, Brother Branham.\" I said, \"If you'd a-went down there, you'd a-had it all.\"\n\nL-59 Well, they wouldn't listen to it. Then the first... then 'fore we left that night... The--the place where we were having lunch. The Holy Spirit showed me a great crack in the earth, and in that was full of oil, and these overflows in Kentucky was just little beds of oil that they were pumping from, but this one come from the main stream. And I said, \"Brother Demos, it's there.\" So they went to searching for it. Said, \"Go down and tell us where the--where the oil well is.\" I said, \"Oh, no! No! No!\"\n\nL-60 See, we don't use the gift of God for commercial. No! No! He could tell me where it was at, but I don't have any need of it. I wouldn't even have faith enough to ask Him. See? If I had a need of it, I believe if I'd ask Him, He'd tell me. But first, you see, your motives and objectives has to be right. You have to have reasons for this. God don't give you those things just because you ask. And you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to that, to be in the will of God. See, if you want to be well, what do you want to be well for? See, if you want to be healed, what's the reason you want to be healed? What are you telling God? What do you want to do with your life when you get healed? See, there's 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min got to be... you've got to have a motive and objective, and they have to be right according to the will of God. And then's when the faith is revealed to you, and God by His sovereign grace places that faith in there, then it's over. See? Now see? [Luke 4:1-13], [Acts 8:9-24]\n\nL-61 Now, to make that Word true, when the brethren got down there, they got... one fellow went over and bought a bunch of stuff, and sold leases, and cheated the other one this way. I said, \"You see, it won't work.\" Now just to make the prophecy sure, within a hundred yards of where these man were digging their well, some man struck the big gusher. And it's there, eleven hundred barrels of oil in a half a day, or something or other like that; still putting it out, right in that main stream. But just to make the prophecy, the Word that had been said that it was there, it was there. The rest of them nearly's all dried up, everywhere through Kentucky. Little ponds, they pump them a little while, and they go. It's only the overflow from this. See?\n\nL-62 But, because of the selfishness got among it, the objectives was wrong, signing up a bunch of stuff \"it would be this way,\" when they promised they would do it for the Kingdom of God, but look like it's for themselves. See?\n\nL-63 And it won't work, no selfish thing will work. Your motives and objectives has to be exactly, perfectly right, then you have faith, to ask. \"If our hearts condemn us not, then we have confidence.\" See? See, we've got to have confidence. \"I want this to the honor and glory of God.\" Then faith has a--a channel to move into; if it doesn't, then you got mental, intellectual faith, and not genuine faith from God. That intellectual faith will get you nowhere. Might get you emotional, but it won't get you the healing that you're looking for. [I John 3:21]\n\nL-64 So, Job, checking himself with the genuine faith that God had give to him that he was \"just,\" that he had done everything that God required him to do. Now when we're going to be prayed for, for our sickness, I wonder if we have done everything that God requires us to do. Have we followed every iota of the Scripture? Have we give Him our hearts and lives to service? What's the reason you want to be healed? That's the reason you can't get faith enough, see, because you haven't maybe made this thing to God sincerely from your heart. Like Hezekiah did, give God the reason, he wanted to set his--his kingdom in order. And God sent His prophet back and told him, and he'd be healed. See? But, you have to have those things made right, first. [II Kings 20:1-6]\n\nL-65 So then as soon as you get to these places and know that it's been revealed to you by the Word of God, by the revelation, by the Word that God requires you to do, then you have faith, genuine faith.\n\nL-66 Now, just like Abraham when he was ninety and nine years old. I believe, Genesis 17. God appeared to this old man, now, ninety and nine years old, when he was almost a hundred years old, that had been waiting upon that promise all these years. He appeared to him in the name of El Shaddai, the \"Breasted-one.\" And what an encouragement it was, yet the promise wasn't fulfilled then. But, \"Abraham, I am the Almighty God, El Shaddai, 'the Strength-giver, the Breasted God.'\" [Genesis 17:1-8]\n\nL-67 Like I've told you before, like the little baby that's fretting, and sick, and crying, and it lays upon its mother's breast. And nurses its strength back from her, because it's satisfied while it's a-nursing, because the only access it has and knows of is the mother's breast. It knows no dose of medicine. You might give him a dose of medicine, he'd squeal and cry. Give him a shot in the arm, and he'd carry on. But the only access to satisfy him is the mother's breast.\n\nL-68 And He said, \"Abraham, you're old, your strength is gone, your arms are withered up, your manhood's gone, but I am your Mother. Just take a-hold of My promise, and be satisfied while you're waiting. Be rested!\"\n\nL-69 Now, that's the way every believer, no matter how bad the cancer's got you, how long you been setting in a wheelchair, any of those things, just if you can grasp that revelation from God! Then be satisfied, knowing that it's going to happen, because faith waits patiently for the promise. See?\n\nL-70 Job knew that he was right. When we find out, here in the Scriptures, that there was... these fellows come to him; his church members. Everything that once seemed dear to him had turned against him, and tried to accuse him of being a secret sinner, because all these things had happened to him. You hear people, yet today, say, \"I told you. Look at him! You see what...?\" That ain't altogether the truth. Sometime it's God testing His people. In this case, it was God testing Job, the best man there was on earth at the time. Now, He was holding him then, because that He knew Job was a 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min prophet that had a vision from God, that he had exactly done what God told him to do and he... God was duty bound to keep His promise to him. [Job 2:11-13], [Job 4:7-8]\n\nL-71 Oh! All Christians has got to be that. When the last struggle of our life comes, and death rattles are in our throat, we still must hold steady and remember that God said, \"I'll raise you up again at the last day.\" See? Got to hold that--that, our testimony, our place in Christ, our position, what we are, knowing that we have kept every Word of His commandment. \"Blessed are they that do His commandments that they might have the right to enter in.\" See? And when we know, that no matter what anyone has said, we've kept every commandment that we see in the Bible, that God has done us... told us to do, with reverence, and love, and respect to the Creator Who wrote the Bible. [John 6:39-40, 44], [Matthew 19:17]\n\nL-72 We say, \"Man wrote It.\"\n\nL-73 \"Man of old, moved by the Holy Ghost, wrote It.\" See? See, God wrote It through man. Like a prophet speaks His Word, it's not the prophet's word, it's God's Word, see, through the prophet. That's the reason It has to come to pass, if it's truly the Truth.\n\nL-74 Now, we see this great man. And, remember, Job had no Bible to read in his day. No! He only went by inspiration. He was a prophet to whom the Word of the Lord comes to. He had--he had only to be inspired, because he knowed his position that he was God's prophet. Now, the only thing that had to happen, was for the inspiration to strike him. And then he knowed what he said would happen, because it was by inspiration.\n\nL-75 That's what the church, if it's in order (set in order), it only... it's got the mechanics ready, it only needs then the dynamics. Tonight, if we'll get the mechanics ready, get our hearts right, the things that we can do, follow every Word, follow Him in baptism, follow Him in every order that He told us to do, get every mechanic ready, and stand there; then we're ready for the dynamics to be lit off, and only God can do that; and that's to drop into your heart that faith that says, \"I am now healed.\" Then don't make any difference what circumstances is, you're healed anyhow; 'cause it's faith, by faith you're healed.\n\nL-76 He had a channel of communication to God, that he'd got by inspiration. He had a way of moving himself out, and letting God move in. And he knowed he was justified. It was a gift, it was a gift for the people; not for Job, but for the people. That's what all Divine gifts are, to serve God's people with. Everybody's not ordered to be a prophet. All of you not... is not ordered to be praying for the sick. All of them's not ordered to be pastors, and so forth. But it's a channel that God has opened to them. And even as we had this morning in the lesson, that he... One man has no business deviating in the next man's channel, no matter how inspired, how much it seems, how well... How many was at the meeting this morning? Let's see your hand. See? See, you cannot. [I Corinthians 12:27-30]\n\nL-77 There's David, just as inspired as he could be, all the people shouting and glorifying God, for a reason that seemed exactly Scripture, but he was the wrong person. That inspiration should have come to Nathan, not David. See, he never even consulted Nathan. You see what happened? See, we have... God said He \"does nothing till He reveals It to His servants the prophets.\" [II Samuel 6:1-9]\n\nL-78 And Job was this prophet in this day. Now, only thing God had done to Job: What always give him wisdom and His Word and inspiration, he could get no inspiration. But he knowed all of his mechanics (he had offered the burnt-offering, he had done everything he knowed to do was right), but he couldn't get a word from God. But the Devil couldn't move him! There you are. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-79 Now, there you are when you're prayed for. You don't have to run back through a line, or go let somebody else pray for you. When you know you've done exactly what God told you to do, see, then wait for that channel of inspiration to open up to you, and, \"Now I'm healed!\" When it drops in there, then it's all over. Oh, you don't need no prayer lines, nothing else, it's over! It's been revealed to you! See?\n\nL-80 Just like the old prophet at the coming of the Lord Jesus, we find out it was revealed to him, the old sage, that \"he would not see death until he seen the Lord's Christ.\" And he believed That, and he waited for It. And the people thought he was crazy, the old man had lost his mind. But he still believed It! Nothing could shake him from It, he 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min knowed God had revealed It to him, for the Bible said, \"It was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost.\" [Luke 2:25-26]\n\nL-81 Simeon coming into the Temple at that minute, walked over and give praise to God, and said, \"Let Thy servant depart in peace.\" When he picked up the baby, \"Mine eyes have seen Thy salvation.\" See, he knowed he was going to see It. No matter how many babies he'd visit each day, he knew God had revealed to him that he was going to see the Christ before he died. Simeon believed that. [Luke 2:27-31]\n\nL-82 Now when it's revealed to you, that you yourself has received God's promise; the inspiration, you being Christians, it struck you, you don't even need a prayer line. The thing... the only thing you need is a open heart when all the mechanics are ready, and let the inspiration drop in, and then nothing can change your mind; you've got it. Outside of that, it won't do no good.\n\nL-83 Now notice, Job needed a channel of inspiration, he had it open. He had a channel to communicate with God, by His inspiration. He had a way of moving himself out and let the Word of God move in. Notice how they--how they come to consult him from the East and from the West, people looking for him because they know that what Job said was the Truth. They knowed that man told the Truth. Because, what he prophesied, that's what happened! And so people come from the East and West.\n\nL-84 He said he'd go over to the markets, the young princes from the East would bow before him, just to hear one word of consolation from him, his great and mighty wisdom, 'cause they knowed the man was honest. He didn't want to boast up himself, he had no axes to grind, no strings to pull, he was just a honest prophet before God. And they had confidence in him, and everybody come from the East and West just to speak to him in a moment. He's spoke of, in the Bible here. But, you see, he lacked inspiration to tell him what all this was about. God let it happen, didn't tell him. [Job 29:21-25]\n\nL-85 Then, one day, we find out that in that, that's the time that... Everybody, as long as you can help them, \"All right.\" But when they want to disagree with you, that's when trouble comes in. But he alone knew he was right; his pulsation of faith, of hearing God's Word speak to him, he knew It was the Truth. Yes, sir! He knew God's Voice. Nobody could fool him on It, for he knew It. It... But whenever you... something's revealed to you, maybe contrary to what the people think... Now, I'm speaking in the line of prophets. When it's God reveals something, which, if there ever is a secret comes out from God to be made known to the people, it will never come through a seminary, it will never come through a group of people, it never did. It always will, has, and will, through one individual, a prophet! Amos 3:7, see, \"The Lord does nothing except first He reveals It through His prophets.\" [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-86 And, now, Job had something wrong with him, but he couldn't get the inspiration on him, and it was worrying him, and that... when you get in that kind of a fix, that's when the enemy moves into every friend, nearly, you got. And they begin to accuse him. Oh, it must have been a miserable thing for him to know his friends that accused him, Satan then goes and joins himself with the enemy. That's when Satan comes in, \"Let me have him, and I'll make him curse You to Your... I'll make him deny his Message. I'll make him curse You. I'll make him go back and say 'It was all wrong.'\" Then he tried him with everything he could, to all the great man and the friends that he used to have. But Job stood flat-footed, for he knew he had heard God's Voice!\n\nL-87 O God, help, tomorrow night, that I can get that Wings Of A Dove. See, I heard the Voice of God that said something, and it's going to happen that way! Just the same as these other things has happened, it's going to happen!\n\nL-88 Now, Job knew it was going to happen. And he knowed that God had told him that, that he was \"just.\" But they made him a sinner, so he waited then for the inspiration. Satan getting in all the--the people and he come around the... his comforters, the so-called, and accusing him, but it didn't move him a bit. But when the Word of God became vindicated to him... He had heard of God by the hearing of the ear, but one day setting out at his lowest point... And while he was setting there, and everyone accusing him, even his wife telling him he was \"wrong,\" he was scraping his boils. And Elihu came down and rebuked him for being selfish, about the way he was accusing God and so forth. [Job 42:1-6]\n\nL-89 And then at that time it was when inspiration struck him, that's when the lightning begin to flash, the thunders 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min begin to roar, that's when the inspiration struck the prophet, and he raised up, and he said, \"I know my Redeemer liveth! And at the last days He'll stand upon this earth. Though the skinworms destroys this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, Whom I shall see for myself.\" [Job 19:25-26]\n\nL-90 He saw... He had been talking about the trees, the botany life, how it dies and lives again; water brings it back again, the smell of water, the scent of water, the results of water pouring upon a tree or something, a seed that went in the ground. He said, \"But a man layeth down and giveth up the ghost, his children come to honor and he perceive it not. O that Thou would hide me in the grave\" (Job 14) \"till Thy wrath be past.\" He said, \"But if a man dies, shall he live again? All the appointed times of my life, I'll wait till my change comes. Thou wilt call me, and I'll answer. Thou hast appointed me bounds that I cannot past,\" so forth. He knowed all these things. He watched the tree live, but what happened to a man when he died? He didn't raise up again. So, God was showing him this Redeemer. [Job 14:1-18]\n\nL-91 He wanted to see if there was somebody who could intercede for him. He had interceded for so many people, but now is there somebody can speak for him? Could there somebody put his hand on Job, or on a sinful man and a Holy God, and make bridge the way? Could he go to His house and knock at the door? Would He open the door and talk to him awhile?\n\nL-92 But, then, when the inspiration dropped into his heart, then he could see God. The lightning's a-flashing, the thunder's a-roaring. And when it did, he stood upon his feet, and he said, \"I know my Redeemer liveth! My Redeemer, and at the last days He'll stand on the earth.\" See, he had begin to see God's reaction to his faith.\n\nL-93 Now, we wonder if we could see God. Is there a way that we could see Him? Now, it was the only way God had, trying Job out. He said, \"I have heard of Thee, with the hearing of the ear, but now I see Thee. But now I see Thee, with my eyes.\" The vision of the invisible had been made plain. He seen the cloud rolling around, he heard the flashing of the lightning, or saw it. And seen the roaring of the thunder, maybe on a clear day, and he seen God was in that cloud and in that lightning. He could see God, with his natural eye. See, because the invisible was made visible. The visible vision of others was then vindicated, clear, to the natural eye. [Job 42:5]\n\nL-94 Just like faith with works, as we spoke on last night. Abraham, no... had no Bible to read either, but he was a prophet, his vision and his faith. And it seemed wrong to others that he should think that way, that he should think they was going to have a baby. But they did have the baby, because his vision of the baby was what he was talking about, \"I'm going to have it! I'm going to have it!\" But when the baby was borned, then the other people could see with the eye what he saw in a vision. And when you go to acting upon what you believe in your heart, then the people know God, and know what's happening to you, by the way you act. That's how you see God with the eye. But to him, all he had done that was good, all that he had done for others, he needed somebody to intercede for him. When the birth of the baby come, Isaac, the--the inspiration that had led him to this had vindicated his vision to where the people could see that what he had saw in a vision was actually the Truth.\n\nL-95 Now, sometimes these great pulsations of faith come right in the time of crisis. It's usually crisis that drives us into this. It was a crisis that drove Job into it. Why, he was at the end of his life. His children was dead; his camels. And all of his goods was gone and destroyed. And his own life, he was broke out from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet with boils. It was a crisis, that he pressed hisself, there's where the inspiration struck him.\n\nL-96 O man and women, tonight, if you could look around and see how close we are to the Coming of the Lord. You who've put off the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You maybe relied upon some sensation, or something that you done that Satan can impersonate, and can't have the real Spirit in you to go all the way in God's promises. How can a man that claims to have the Holy Ghost deny one Word of this Bible, being, \"not right\"? You can't do it!\n\nL-97 No matter how religious you are, how many churches you belong to, how many books your name's on, if that genuine Holy Ghost is in you (which is this Word manifested), you'll see the Message and the hour, because it's the Holy Ghost that does it. But there has to be something light that off, inspiration strike you. And if there's... if you pour water on the ground, on the ground, on the ground, and there's no seed in there to strike it, how can it ever bring forth anything? There's nothing there to bring forth. That is, that only the Elected of God will see It. 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min\n\nL-98 The Elected of God seen It in Noah's time, Moses' time, Jesus' time, the apostles' time, Luther's time, Wesley's time, Pentecostal time, because that was the Seed that was on the earth when this inspiration was poured out. Now while the inspiration's poured out, to gather the Bride together, it's only those who are Elected will see It. Jesus said, \"I thank Thee, Father, that Thou hast hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent, and revealed It to babes such as learn.\" Now, inspiration has to strike it. [Matthew 11:25]\n\nL-99 Now, when the inspiration struck him, that did it. He had It then! Now, we find out, there comes a time of these crisis when the press is right on. And you look around today, look at the condition we're living in. Aren't we living in a modern Sodom and Gomorrah? Hasn't the world come back? That was a Gentile world that was destroyed then, by fire. Didn't Jesus say, in St. Luke, the 17th chapter, the 28th, 29th, and 30th verse, that, \"As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man, when the Son of man is being revealed\"? What is a \"revealed\"? Is a secret made known, a revelation; is to reveal or make known a secret. [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-100 Now, these things that's been hid all through the church ages is now being revealed, made known. Now, we could say that, and if God didn't back that up, that's wrong. See, God don't need anybody to interpret His Word, He's His Own interpreter. He said, \"A virgin shall conceive,\" and she did. He said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was. And we are not living in Luther's age, Wesley age, or the Pentecostal age. The Pentecostal age was only a restoration of the gifts coming back to the church, but we're living in the evening time, we're living in a time of the calling out of the Bride. [Isaiah 7:14], [Genesis 1:3], [Zechariah 14:7]\n\nL-101 And just as it was hard for the Catholics to see Luther, and the Luther's to see the Wesley, and the Penteco-... the Wesley's to see the Pentecostal age, so is it hard for the Pentecostals to see this age. It's always been that way, because It's poured out upon an Elected Seed, and that only. That's what the Bible teaches. They can't see It, Jesus even prayed for them, said, \"They was blind, they didn't know it.\" Revelation tells us, in this Laodicean church age, when He was put out of the church, that they're \"naked! poor! miserable! blind! and don't know it.\" Back again, they can't see It, can't understand It. They're so creeped up in traditions! [Matthew 15:14], [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-102 But remember the promised Word of God by the mouth of Jesus Christ, the very God that spoke creation into existence, He was the One before the foundation of the world that spoke the words \"And let there be,\" and there was. For He said, \"He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. But as many as did know Him, to them He gave the power to become the sons of God.\" The very Creator, and the very Creator Himself, when He raised up Lazarus from the dead, He said, \"Think this not strange, for the hour's coming that when all that's in the grave will hear the Voice of the Son of man, and shall come out.\" The very God that said \"Let there be Light,\" said \"The Voice of the Son of man would wake those that are in the grave.\" It has to happen in its season. He spoke, \"Let there be male and female,\" and so forth, and all this, years and hundreds of years before it happened. [John 1:10-12], [John 5:25-29]\n\nL-103 The inspiration hit the prophet Isaiah, he said, \"Unto us a child is born, a son is given. His Name shall be called Counselor, Prince of Peace, the Mighty God, the everlasting Father.\" Years passed, months, years, days, weeks, years rolled by, hundreds of years rolled by. Eight hundred years later, Emmanuel was borned by a virgin! Why? Is because it was spoke by the lips of God's anointed prophet, a seed went forth. See? \"And that great hour,\" said, \"will you seek... ask Me of a vision or a sign.\" [Isaiah 9:6]\n\nL-104 He said, \"I'll give them a sign, an everlasting sign, 'A virgin shall conceive,' an everlasting sign.\"\n\nL-105 Now, we find that in those hours of real stress, that's usually when the Spirit of God moves in. He let the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace, before He ever moved a hand. But when He moves, He moves.\n\nL-106 Now, we notice here that in Luke, the--the 17th chapter, and the 30th verse, that He said, \"In the last days, that the Son of man would reveal Himself as He did just before Sodom and Gomorrah, and the same conditions would exist.\" He told about Moses, about... and I beg your pardon, not about Moses, but about Noah. How that the people was \"eating, drinking, and so forth, marrying and given in marriage.\" Then He come around, He said, \"Now, as it was in the days of Lot, so shall it be at the time when the Son of man is being revealed.\" Now, watch, the Son of man was 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min revealed to Abraham's group, as a man, a prophet in a form of human flesh, a ordinary man with dust on His clothes, and Abraham called Him \"Elohim.\" [Genesis 17:1], [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-107 Now, Jesus promises here that in the last days the Son of man will be revealed again to that same type of group, the royal Seed of Abraham, just before the fire falls. Remember, the church never received any more witness, Abraham and them didn't, the promised son that they were looking for was brought right away after that. And the church is looking for the Promised Son, He will come right after the days of this ministry, He'll be revealed from the heavens. Now, we see it too plain, it's got to be. Now, the only thing there has to be is something pulsates, gets into a man, God vindicate and tells him and shows him that that is the thing to happen; and that you're going to... [Luke 17:28-30]\n\nL-108 Like Moses did, he didn't want to deliver those children, but God spoke to him in a burning bush. He didn't want to go, but he had to go. Moses had heard of Him being the great Jehovah. But then he could see Him, He was in the form of a Pillar of Fire. \"I've heard of Thee, but now I see Thee.\" What was He seen in? His Word vindicated. [Exodus 3:1-4]\n\nL-109 God told Abraham that \"his people would sojourn in a strange land for four hundred years, but He would bring them out with a mighty hand.\" [Genesis 15:13-14]\n\nL-110 And, notice, this burning bush gave vindication to what the prophet Abraham had said would take place. Moses said, \"I've heard of it, but now I see it!\"\n\nL-111 Now, we've heard that in the last days that the Son of man will come among His people and reveal Himself to the people in the same way that He did at the... just before the destruction of Sodom. The Son of man, what did He do? He knowed the secrets that was in Sarah's heart. Also give the promise to Abraham. Abraham had heard God's Voice, he might have seen Him in many different ways (I don't know how He talked to him, through dreams or through prophecies), but this time he saw Him. \"I've heard of You, now I see You.\" [Genesis 18:12-13]\n\nL-112 And the church has heard of God, they've read of Him, and what He did, and the promises He made, but now we see Him with our eyes (just the same as Job did), \"I've heard of Thee, but now I see Thee.\" My! What a different.\n\nL-113 Moses, in that crisis, cried out. And we find out, in Exodus, the 14th chapter, the 13th and to the 16th verse, Moses in that great strain there with the children of Israel, inspiration struck him, and he said what he was supposed to say, not knowing he said it. See, \"Stand still and see the salvation of God.\" God had never spoke to him yet. See, the inspiration struck him. [Exodus 14:13], [Exodus 14:10-12]\n\nL-114 They said, \"Why did you bring us out here? We ought to have died in Egypt. Was because there was no graves down there? Bring us out here, and let us die; we could have lived in peace as slaves until we died, but you brought us out here.\"\n\nL-115 Moses, a prophet, knowing he had access to God, was inspired, and he said, \"Stand still and you'll see the salvation of God; for the Egyptians you're looking at today, you'll never see them again.\" How did he know it was going to happen? How did he know? He didn't know what he spoke.\n\nL-116 But as immediately after he spoke it, God told him how to do it. Said, \"Moses, don't cry to Me, take your staff in your hand and stretch it out over the sea, and tell the children of Israel to 'Walk!'\" Amen! [Exodus 14:16]\n\nL-117 The inspiration! That's the way it strikes you if you're sick. That's the way it strikes you if you're afflicted. Something's revealed to you, and you see that it's been revealed, you speak up, \"I'm healed!\"\n\nL-118 Then God tells you what to do, \"Rise up and start walking.\" Amen! Then it's all over, when you can do it that way. That's the way God does it, then you see God manifested through yourself. [Luke 5:23]\n\nL-119 It was God that told him to do it. Now, then, all that was present, all of Israel that was present saw the inspiration that struck Moses. They seen God, with their own eye, blow that water back from one side to the other. And that Pillar of Fire led them right across the--the sea. He heard of God, then they seen God.\n\nL-120 Joshua was in a hour of crisis, when the armies was routed, and the sun was going down. Joshua was a prophet, and he knew that if them armies ever had a chance to unite again and come against him, he would lose more man, so in 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min that hour of crisis when something had to be done... There's only one thing, if he could keep them running, he'd route them, every one, down. But there wasn't enough light to do it, so Joshua stood, raised his hands, he said, \"Sun, stand still! And moon, hang over Ajalon till I get through with this battle.\" And the sun stood still. They heard Joshua speak, and then they seen God (with their own eyes) in action. True! [Joshua 10:12-13]\n\nL-121 See, of course, it was a paradox to see something that seems to be impossible, yet it's true. But, \"The sun stood still,\" says the Bible. I don't know what you people think, that thinks the world was run, now; but, anyhow, \"the sun stood still.\" Perhaps Joshua never had tried to figure out how he was going to--to do it, how God was going to do it, the only thing that he said was, \"Sun stand still!\" He said it, perhaps not knowing what he was saying, because it was God that give it to him, and He worked.\n\nL-122 Same thing in Mark 11:23, \"If you say to this mountain 'be moved,' and don't doubt in your heart, but believe that what you said will come to pass, you can have what you said.\" But you can't stand there fumble in your mind and say it, you've got to be inspired to say it. Amen! [Mark 11:23]\n\nL-123 Excuse the expression; but that day, setting there in that woods (and God's my judge, and I could fall dead on this pulpit), when that Scripture had stumped me all my life... setting there that morning in the woods, and I was thinking on that, and that Voice spoke to me, He said, \"That Scripture is like all Scriptures, It's true.\"\n\nL-124 And I thought, \"Well, how could it be?\" And He said, \"You're...\" I said... He said, \"Speak, and it will be that way. Don't doubt It.\"\n\nL-125 And I was talking to Somebody, setting way out in the woods. No squirrels, been there for three days, there's no squirrels there. And I was setting in a sycamore thicket. Squirrels don't even come... anyone that hunt squirrels, know they're not in sycamore. And I had been setting there; and wind blowing real hard, about ten o'clock in the morning, and I was thinking again.\n\nL-126 And It said, \"You're hunting, and you need squirrels just the same as Abraham needed a ram.\" [Genesis 22:13-14]\n\nL-127 I thought, \"That's always told me the Truth, but this sounds funny.\" And I got up from where I was setting, looked all around, \"Where is that Person that was talking to me?\" Nothing; wind just blowing real hard. And I thought, \"Could I have fell asleep and dreamed that? No, I wasn't asleep. I was setting up against the tree there, watching, supposed to pick up Brother Woods and Brother Sothmann back there, just in a little bit, around ten o'clock in the morning. Farmers all out there working, gathering their corn.\"\n\nL-128 And I heard It again, say, \"You are hunting, and you need game. How many do you need?\" And I thought, \"Now, I don't want to overdo this, I'm just going to ask for three, three squirrels. I want young, three red squirrels. I want them.\" He said, \"Then speak about it.\" And I said, \"I am going to get three young red squirrels.\" He said, \"Which a-way will they come?\"\n\nL-129 \"Well,\" I thought, \"I've went this far, there's Something talking to me here.\" Just the same as you hear me talking. And God in Heaven, with this Bible over my heart, knows that that's true. And He... And I said, \"Well,...\" I picked out a ridiculous place, an old dry limb hanging out of there (about fifty yards, where my rifle was shot in). I said, \"The first one will be right there,\" and there he was.\n\nL-130 I rubbed my eyes and looked back (I turned my head), and I thought, \"I don't want to shoot a vision.\" So I looked around again, and there set the squirrel. I throwed a shell up in my gun, aimed up, and I could see his black eye, young red squirrel. I thought, \"I--I... maybe I'm sleeping, I--I'll wake up in a few minutes. See, I'm dreaming about this.\" Well, I leveled down, shot the squirrel and it dropped off the limb. I thought, \"Well, I don't know.\" I thought, \"Well, should I go over and look for it?\" And--and I walked over there, and there it laid. I picked it up and blood run out of it. A vision don't bleed, you know. So I picked it up, and it was a squirrel. I got real numb, all over.\n\nL-131 And I looked around, I said, \"God, that was You!\" I said, \"Thank You, for this. Now I'll go out and...\" He said, \"But you said! Do you doubt what you said? You said you'd get 'three.' Now where will the next one come 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min from?\" I thought, \"Well, if I'm dreaming, I'm going to continue on.\"\n\nL-132 So I--I said... I picked out an old post over there, of a tree that was all wrapped up with this here poison ivy. You never get a squirrel in that. So I said, \"The next one will come right out of that poison ivy,\" and there set that young red squirrel looking right at me. I set my gun down, and rubbed my eyes. Turned around again, I thought... There he set, turned his head sideways. I shot the squirrel, and then I started to go home.\n\nL-133 But said, \"You said 'three'! Do you doubt what you said?\" I said, \"No, Lord, I don't doubt what I said, for You're confirming.\" This is one Scripture that stumped me: \"Not if I say, but if you say.\" Not if Jesus said it, but if you say it yourself. [Mark 11:20-25], [Matthew 17:20], [Matthew 21:20-21]\n\nL-134 And I thought, \"Somehow I've broke into that channel, and I know He's here because I'm almost beside myself.\" I thought, \"I'll make this one ridiculous, sure enough.\" I said, \"They'd be a, red squirrel come down off that hill, come right down this a-way, and right by me, and go out, and set on that limb, and look down there at that farmer.\" Here he come down the hill, went right out, and sat, looked at the farmer. And I shot him. Satan said to me, \"You know what? The woods is just full of them, now.\" And I set there till twelve o'clock, and not another thing happened. It goes to show that when God... He's the very Creator of Heavens and earth!\n\nL-135 Listening in, in Jeffersonville now, there's a family named Wright. Brother Woods and I went down to see them. They make the communion wine for the church. Little Edith was setting there in the room; a little crippled girl, that she had been sick all of her life, and so we had always looked to God to heal her. Her sister, a widow, her husband had been killed; her name was Hattie, very humble little woman. And while Brother Banks and I went out to get her a rabbit, they had cooked a big cherry cobbler; and made me set down and eat.\n\nL-136 We was all setting around the table, we were talking about this, it just happened a few days before. And while setting around the table, talking about this, all at once I said, \"What could have happened?\" I said, \"Brother Wright, you're an old man, hunted squirrels all your life. Brother Shelby, you're an expert squirrel hunter. Brother Wood, so are you. I've hunted them since a kid. Did you ever see a squirrel in a sycamore and locust thicket?\" \"No, sir.\"\n\nL-137 I said, \"They just wasn't there.\" I said, \"The only thing I know, It's just the same God. When Abraham needed a ram, He was Jehovah-jireh, He could 'provide for Himself.'\" I said, \"I believe it's the same thing.\" And little ol' Hattie setting back there, said, \"Brother Branham, that's nothing but the Truth!\"\n\nL-138 She said the right thing! When she said that, the Holy Spirit dropped over in that channel again, every one of them felt It. I raised up, I said, \"Sister Hattie, THUS SAITH THE LORD, you said the right word like the Syrophenician woman said. The Holy Spirit's speaking to me now, and said for me to give you the desire of your heart.\" I said, \"Now, if I be God's servant, if it is, it'll happen. If I ain't God's servant, then I'm a liar, and it won't happen, I'm a deceiver.\" I said, \"Now try and see, it's the Spirit of God or not.\"\n\nL-139 She said, \"Brother Branham,\" (everybody was crying), said, \"what shall I ask?\" I said, \"You got a crippled sister setting there.\"\n\nL-140 I had twenty dollars in my pocket, to give to her, that she had put in a donation. The woman don't make a capital of about two hundred. dollars a year, on that little, old, poor farm, her and two boys. Her boys had got to be regular 'Ricky's,' school days, you know, and just sassing their mother; and fifteen, sixteen years old. And, oh, they were standing over there laughing at what I was saying.\n\nL-141 And I said, \"You've got a father and mother setting here that's old. You haven't got any money. Ask for the money, and see if it comes in your lap. Ask for your sister, and see if she don't get up and walk.\" I knew then, like Job, there's just something you know when you strike it. Said, \"I know! Here I stand before about ten people,\" I said, \"if this doesn't happen, then I'm a false prophet.\" 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min\n\nL-142 Said, \"What shall I ask?\" I said, \"It's up to you to make your decision. I cannot make your decision.\" She looked around, the little woman. And all at once, she said, \"Brother Branham, the greatest desire in my heart is the salvation of my two boys.\"\n\nL-143 I said, \"I give you your boys, in the Name of Jesus Christ.\" And them snickering, laughing, fun making boys fell across their mother's lap, and surrendered their life to God, and was filled with the Holy Ghost right then.\n\nL-144 Why? That is Truth! God has the authority to kill me, before these people across the nation. Many of you here and in Jeffersonville, I can hear the tabernacle ring out now, \"Amen!\" because they're setting right there listening at it. See, because it's the Truth! What is it? It's when the God, by His sovereign grace; it happens! Outside of that, it won't happen.\n\nL-145 In that crucial moment... Think of the man and the people that I'm acquainted with. God bypassing all the celebrities, and everything, to give a poor, little ol' humble woman, can't hardly sign her own name; and He knowed that what she'd ask for. And that was the greatest thing; for her sister is now dead, and her mother and father has to die, the money would've perished, but the souls of her boy is Eternal! And that was the hour for them to catch It. And just as soon as I said, \"I give you your boys, in the Name of Jesus Christ,\" there they fell across their mother's lap. How many in here knows that to be Truth, you know it? See, there it is. Yes. Why? Inspiration!\n\nL-146 Now: \"I have heard of Thee, that Thou could create squirrels; I've heard of Thee, that Thou could create a ram; but now I see Thee, with mine own eye!\" The manifestation, the vision made visible. When God promised anything, that's what He'll do.\n\nL-147 Notice, when you have a need, perhaps like Joshua. He had a need; he never thought of the circumstances, he spoke it, and it was God! Do you believe the sun stood still? So do I. How did it do it? Don't try to figure it out, but it did it. Joshua did it, and raised his hands; in that crucial moment he had access to God, and that's what happened. It was timely. The Spirit of the Living God had seen the need of it, and pushed upon Joshua to say it. The same God seen the need of Abraham. The same God seen the need of confirming this Scripture to me, that that Scripture's true, too! The same God seen the need of those two predestinated boys, and it was that moment He proved it and confirmed His Word.\n\nL-148 St. Mark 14, we see a woman believed on Him, she had had need and seen He had need for His feet to be washed, she had only to be inspired to go into action. Now listen close as... before we close. She only had to be inspired to go into action, because she had already heard about Him. She heard that \"He forgive a woman of her sins, a harlot. And said, 'Which one of you is without sin? Cast the first stone.'\" She had heard about Him, but now she seen Him. She was inspired to serve Him. That's the only thing you have to be. [John 8:3-7]\n\nL-149 Let the Holy Spirit tell you that \"You're a sinner!\" Let the Holy Spirit tell you \"You're wrong!\" Let the Holy Spirit prove to you by the Scriptures that \"You're Scripturally wrong!\"And what... 'cause It'll only stir through one straight channel of every Scripture of God, It won't bypass for nothing. If you do, It'll never do you any good. Because the Holy Spirit can inspire It to you, but if the soul isn't right with God, as we've been through this week, it's no good anyhow. Remember, false anointed-ones will rise in the last days; not false Jesuses, false christs (anointed ones), and will deceive the very Elected if it were possible. [Matthew 24:24], [Mark 13:22]\n\nL-150 Notice, she had a service to do for Him. She had heard of Him, now she seen Him with her eyes. She had a service to do, and she had nothing to do it with. So she rushed forward anyhow, to do the service, God furnished the water and towels to wash His feet. She had heard of a Living God, all of her life, but now she seen Him with her eyes. She knew it was Him, and inspiration struck her, and said, \"This is the Messenger!\" He needed a service (she had nothing to serve Him by), His feet was dirty. But she rushed forward anyhow, to do Him a service, because she was inspired to do it. [Luke 7:36-50]\n\nL-151 O the backslidden church member, denominational man or woman, can't you see the need Jesus has tonight? If inspiration can only strike you, this is the hour to do it. But she seen Him with her eyes. The others there were even 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min mocking Him. They didn't believe His Message. Frankly, the host, the pastor-host, ol' Simon, had got Him down there to make fun out of Him. They didn't believe He was a prophet.\n\nL-152 So then when it seemed like the Devil had worked it just right in for him to say this, he said in hisself, \"If this man was a prophet, he would know what kind of a woman that was at his feet. If he was a prophet!\" See, it wasn't even revealed to him who He was. There couldn't be any inspiration strike him, 'cause there's nothing there to strike to. But it was struck to her! [Luke 7:39]\n\nL-153 Her eyes had seen beyond his criticism. She believed He was, see, the Word of the prophets! She knowed that That was all the Words of the prophets, was vindicated in Him. She had heard He was on earth, but now she sees Him. Watch what she done. She seen the Word made flesh, the Messiah, the Emmanuel. When she gave vent to her pulsation of faith (of revelation of Who He was, in the time she was living, that He was God's Lamb for such sinners as she was), she went forth to serve His needs without knowing how she would do it.\n\nL-154 That's the way a genuine healing comes, when it's revealed to you that \"He was wounded for your transgressions, bruised for your iniquity, and with His stripes you were healed.\" When it's inspired to you to see His Presence here, of St. Mark 11... or St. Luke 17:30, that He's going to reveal Hisself in the last days (among His people, in human flesh) like He did before Sodom. When you see that, and something strikes you! [Isaiah 53:5]\n\nL-155 The doctor might say, \"The cancer's still there.\" The patient might say, \"I--I--I--I--I--I don't know how I'm going to walk, but I'm going to walk anyhow.\" We don't know how it's going to do.\n\nL-156 She went forward to serve Him, because inspiration struck Him... struck her, that that was the hour, that was the Messenger, that was the Messiah who was to heal, and she believed It. And He needed a service done to Him, and she went forward without anything showing that she could do it. She just went upon her inspiration. Watch! God broke up the fountains of the tear glands in her eyes. The same eyes that had heard... ears that had heard Him; the eyes that seen It, broke up with joy. Then that other, God-given long hair, with them tears flowing down. God furnished her towels (with her hair), and with her tears. She served His needs, the need of the Living God. She had heard about It, but now she seen Him, she could do Him a service. [Luke 7:36-50]\n\nL-157 O sinner! Why don't you do likewise as you see the needs now? That He needs you, your service! Now you see the One, Who once you heard about in the Bible. We seen Him last night come in here, and what He done. We see Him, meeting after meeting, and sometimes we set just as cold and indifferent, say, \"Yes, I know the Scripture says it. Oh, I--I've seen it done, see.\" We have no enthusiasm, it don't seem to strike us right. There don't seem to be something, like if you was pouring...\n\nL-158 Taking a match and striking it, if the match hasn't got the sulfur right on the head of the match, it cannot strike. And you can rake and rake and rake, but if some chemical has killed the sulfur on there, it will not strike, there'll be no light. But if that chemical, the sulfur to strike against the metal will... it's still on there when it strikes, it'll light.\n\nL-159 And when the true, genuine vindication of the Scriptures of this last-day Message, and you see the Presence of Jesus Christ, that you had heard what He done in His life, and hearing the Scriptures say \"He's the same yesterday, today and forever\"; and just before the Sodom condition is fired-over with the wrath of God, see Jesus return amongst His people, formed in human flesh, and do the same thing He done. My! It ought to strike our souls to Glory! It ought to do something to us. Why? It's dropping on that. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-160 You heard in the Bible what He did, how the woman touched His garment. He turned around and told her what her trouble was, and her faith made her whole. Now, He promised that He would do that same thing again, just before the world would be burnt, and the world would be in a Sodom condition. The New Testament, the Prophet, the God-Prophet, the Prophet of prophets, the God of all the prophets, the fulness of the Godhead bodily, God of... manifested in a flesh, the Creator, of Genesis. Hallelujah! It's His Word! He said it would happen! And we see Sodom condition, we see the world in that condition, now we see Him come down and do exactly what He said He would do. Now, we've heard of Him, now we see Him! \"I've heard of You with my ears, now I see You with my eyes.\" Amen! \"I 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min see Him with my own eyes.\" What a hour it should be! What a time it should be! The confirmation of His Word! Always when the Word is confirmed, that's God speaking in His Word, making Hisself visible that you can see. [Matthew 9:20-21]\n\nL-161 Now, here's a little ol' prostitute off the street, she falls at the altar, before Jesus, and she washed His feet with the--with the tears, and--and wiped them with her hair. God honored, He said, \"Wherever this Gospel is being preached, let this be told for a memorial to her.\" Why? Look how filthy she was, but something struck. She seen the Word of the promise, from the Garden of Eden, this, \"woman's Seed shall bruise the serpent's head.\" She seen the Messiah that had been borned of a virgin. [Matthew 26:7-13], [Mark 14:3-9], [Genesis 3:15]\n\nL-162 She heard He was to be borned of a virgin, but they heard that man was on earth. She heard there was a young rabbi, Prophet, who healed the sick. She believed that! And here she come down the street, walking around, looking around. And she looked over there and seen that great party going on. She slipped up to the fence, and looked through, and there He was. There He was! Something said, \"That's Him!\" See, that's all she needed to be inspired. See what happened? She seen the Word of God made flesh. She had heard with her ear, now she saw with her eyes. [Luke 7:36-50]\n\nL-163 Now, everybody knows that we have a promise of the church condition, in the last day. The church, in its present condition, can never fulfill the commandments of God, the great commission, could never call the Bride out. Which one would do it? The Pentecostal's? I should say not. None of the rest of them. That's the shuck that's on the wheat. That come out, looked just exactly like the wheat, but there was no wheat to it. It opens up, but the grain comes out of that. They organize, they kill themselves. There's where they die. They're stalks. But the wheat has come up through there, and now it's begin to form in the Bride-form. The corn of wheat that fell into the ground through the dark ages, it had to die.\n\nL-164 That critic saying, \"Why would a God of mercy, could open up the Red Sea, stand let them poor Christians be eat up with lions, and burnt, and everything? Set up, just like He laughed about!\" The poor ignoramus! Did he not know, \"Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground\"? It had to die through those dark ages, like any other corn of wheat has to go beneath the earth and be buried, to bring forth in the first reformation them two blades of Luther, the stalk. It had to come forth in the Wesleyans, out yonder, to bring forth the pollen, the tassels, the great missionary age. Had to come forth in the Pentecostal, for the restoration of the gifts, almost to deceive the very Elected. Looks like a wheat grain; open it up, there's no wheat there at all, it's only shuck. But back in there, then, they begin to form the oneness organization, the trinity organization, the twoness organization, and church of God organization, and all organized, and just death exactly! And now what happens? But it's a shelter for the wheat, it's been growing through it all the time. [Matthew 24:4-24]\n\nL-165 Now it's begin to pull away, the wheat's begin to be seen. This is not a Pentecostal age. This is the latter-day age. This is the Bride age. This is the evening Light. This is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled, to follow God's pattern. This is Luke 17:30, to be fulfill. This is the second... And Jeremiah, and all the rest of them, that Joel has spoke of these days, this is that day. \"I have heard, Lord, and It was coming, but now I see It with my eye.\" [Zechariah 14:7]\n\nL-166 Though many... how many false impersonators rise, them Jannes and Jambres with all their gimmicks to do everything that Moses did, never shook him or Aaron at all. They knowed where... like Job, they knowed Who their inspiration come from. They knowed It was THUS SAITH THE LORD! And the same Bible that spoke of them, said, \"They'd come in the last days, impersonators.\" Those religious denominations, when something started... Who started first? Moses or them? If they had started first, Moses would have been the--the mimic. [II Timothy 3:8]\n\nL-167 Now we got all kinds of discerners and everything else that's trying to throw your mind from the genuine thing of God, which God has proven to be the Truth by His Scripture. \"We've heard of It with our ears, now we see It with our eye.\" Amen! Do you believe It? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] All our hearts! Inspiration! And in that day when the Son of man is being revealed, a Son of man, Jesus Christ made manifest amongst His people.\n\nL-168 A man walked down there before Abraham and his group, just an ordinary-looking man, dust on his clothes. He had his back turned to the tent, He said, \"Where is your wife Sarah?\" (not S-a-r-r-a, S-a-r-a-h; A-b-r-a-h-a-m, not A-b-r-a-m). Called his name, said, \"Where is she?\" [Genesis 18:9-15] 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min Said, \"She's in the tent, behind You.\" Said, \"I'm going to visit you according to the time of life\" (and she laughed up her sleeve). Said, \"Why did she laugh?\" (uh-huh). Now, He promised. Them people was the one that was looking for a promised son. [Genesis 18:9-15]\n\nL-169 Now, I don't care how much the people act in these denominations, say they're \"looking for Christ,\" their actions prove they're not. That's right. Your actions speaks louder than your words. All they're thinking about is making denominational members, but there are some people, one here and there, that's looking for the coming of the Lord. They're watching for... though. Only those will He reveal Himself to, only those will understand. [Matthew 11:27], [Luke 10:22]\n\nL-170 Just the Elected understood Who He was. Just think, there's about maybe three million people, Jews, on earth, there wasn't one third of them ever knowed He was there till He had done come and gone. See? But He revealed Himself to those who were waiting: John the Baptist, and--and the apostles that had been called by John, and so forth, and blind Anna in the temple, Simeon the priest that \"it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost that he was going to see the Christ.\" All those great religious leaders, theologians and things, blind as they could be!\n\nL-171 Only can the rain raise the seed, if the seed's already there. And as you was a germ first in your father, and he didn't know you, yet you were in your father. But through a bedding ground of your mother, you were made manifest in his likeness, and then he could talk to you. God, the Great God; if you've got Eternal Life, then the germ of Eternal Life was in God at the beginning. And you were there, you were in His thinking, your name and all. And He, by foreknowledge, ordained you to see This. And you that was not ordained, will never see It. But, remember, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, \"The hour is here!\" Won't you believe Him? Give your lives to Him. I have to stop, it's after nine. Let's bow our heads.\n\nL-172 \"I have heard, Lord, of Thee, now I see Thee!\" Lord Jesus, bless this people as they wait. Now I'm going to ask you a question. I'm going to let the Holy Spirit (I trust that He will) search out your minds, try you, try your soul, and see if you really believe. And if you find there's a little bit of doubt there, will you raise your hand? Say, \"Lord Jesus, let me see You. I've heard of You, but I've never really seen You. Let me see You, I'll believe.\" All right. That's fine.\n\nL-173 Is there some here that doesn't know Him as your Saviour? Raise your hand, say, \"If... I--I'm a sinner, but if I... if You--if You'll just let me see You, Lord Jesus, manifest this Word that they're talking about. I know that that's how Job seen You. I know that's how Abraham saw You. I know that's how all the rest of them saw You, because it was Your promised Word being vindicated. I've heard all kinds of things, and gimmicks, and everything, but I understand that there's a last-day Message in the land, that was spoke of by an Angel on the river, in 1933. I heard of the healing services going forth, and I know when that takes place, it can't stay in that same old denominational rut.\" It wasn't sent for that, never did stay there. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?...\n\nL-174 What if Moses would've come, said, \"Let's build an ark like Noah did, float out of Egypt down the river\"? Oh, no. See? No! He had a Message from God, he was the manifestation. That prophet arising on the scene, ought to have proved to Israel right there. They hadn't had a prophet for four hundred years, they hadn't had a prophet, and here a prophet rises on the scene. They ought to have knowed that something was going to happen.\n\nL-175 Israel again hadn't had a prophet for hundreds of years, and here come Jesus on the scene. And the woman at the well, said, \"Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. Now, we haven't had one for four hundred years.\" Because, He knowed what was in her heart. See? [John 4:19-26]\n\nL-176 Now, we're promised a church age through reformers, and we've had them. But He promised, in Malachi 4, He'd keep His pattern in the last days, what would take place, \"To turn the hearts of the children back to the Faith of the apostolic father.\" For that very purpose! And the church is so broke up in denominations and isms, it's so tore to pieces till it's dead; it's been a carrier. And then He promised, in the hour of the seventh angel's Message, the Seven Seals would be revealed; and the mysteries of God would be declared (Revelation 10) when the seventh angel begins to 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min sound his Message, not the healing service, the Message that follows the healing service. [Malachi 4:6]\n\nL-177 Jesus was a \"great guy\" as long as He could heal the sick. But He said when, \"I and My Father are One.\" [John 10:30] \"Huh-uh! That was wrong!\" Job was \"great,\" till something happened to him. See? It's always that way.\n\nL-178 Believe! Will you accept Him now? Raise your hand, say, \"I do believe Him. I want to accept Him.\" God bless you. God bless you. That's fine. Now set real still and pray just a moment.\n\nL-179 Dear God, in this solemn moment, it's going to be a time like this when there really will be a clap of thunder someday, and the Son of God shall descend from the heavens with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and the trump of God, the dead in Christ shall rise. And each one of us knows and are aware tonight, Father, that we're going to have to answer for every word we give, and every word we say. Even the thoughts that's in our hearts, we're going to answer for it. I pray Thee, God, in Jesus' Name, that You'll cleanse every heart that's in here. Cleanse my heart, cleanse the hearts of this people. And may we be prepared, Lord, and may our spiritual eyes be opened tonight to see the Glory of Almighty God. We have heard of Him, O Father, God, we pray that You'll let us see Him. Grant it, Father. Grant these blessings, I pray, through Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. [I Thessalonians 4:16], [Romans 14:12], [Matthew 12:32]\n\nL-180 Remember: In your heart, where you're setting, make your little altar. Say, \"Lord Jesus, come into my heart now. Give me something to... something I can hold to. Let me feel that inspiration that tells me that You're 'present.'\" Now, what a statement to make to people! What a--a thing to do! Now I'm going to ask the Lord God, ask...\n\nL-181 How many of you take the tapes? You heard of: What Time Is It, Sirs? Did we show those magazines and things, a year before it happened? Science is stumped on it. There was the Lord Jesus crowned and with that white wig on as you see in the Bible, in Revelation 1, and the Daniel, Supreme Judge of Heaven and earth. Right there, when science can't even see It themselves. And in the observatory, out there in the University of Arizona and down through Mexico, they're searching, have been for the last two years. And there it was told you, it was \"going to happen,\" before.\n\nL-182 How about the Alaskan earthquake? Watch Hollywood fall into the sea! Watch and see if it doesn't. He's never told me anything wrong yet, it'll do it. See? And just watch and see if we're not living in the closing hours of history. No man knows what hour He's coming. But I know one thing: I believe, in my present condition, if I'm in my right mind, and if I wasn't a Christian, I'd sure want to be a real Bible Christian, not a denominational. Don't rely upon 'cause you've shouted. We heard that this morning, proved it by the Word of God; it's altogether out of the will of God, didn't do a thing but cause death. Don't be in the stalk, be in the Life. See? Have faith in God. [Matthew 24:36]\n\nL-183 Do you believe that the God that made this promise, that did appear Himself, in the Book of Genesis, and appeared to Abraham and performed that miracle... That same God was made flesh, human flesh, borned of a virgin. That was a theophany there, of course, but then when He come in human flesh and was the same man, and performing the same things,... Don't you believe that if God could get a person, that He promised to do according to Malachi 4, a channel that He could speak through, He'll perform the same thing He said He'd do there? Do you believe that? I believe He would, too. [Isaiah 7:14], [Matthew 1:18-25]\n\nL-184 Do you believe that you could have the faith to touch His garment, His faith to touch the garment? Do you believe present now that something's speaking to your heart that would tell you that you have faith to touch His garment? You believe you could do that? You reach up and touch with your faith then, not with emotion, just with absolutely pure, unadulterated faith. Just say, \"Lord, I believe. I believe with all my heart. I want You to touch me 'cause I--I've heard You done it, now I want to see it with my own eyes.\" [Matthew 9:20-21]\n\nL-185 And I can't touch you. It takes God to do the touching. Do you believe He will do it? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-186 I'm looking right back to my left here. It seems like there's a channel, kinda, as I've spoke, pulling that way. Being I've directed it that way, now it comes in wonderful. It's a lady setting there with her husband. She's not from here. 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min She's from Texas, Dallas. She's suffering, also her husband's suffering. She's suffering from a complication, she's had an operation. That's right. Her husband suffers something with his back, back trouble. Mr. and Mrs. Corbet, from Texas; Dallas, Texas. If that's so, raise up your hand. I'm a stranger to you. Is that right? No way in the world for me to know that. What is it? \"I have heard of Thee by the ear, now I see Thee.\" See what I mean? Now ask that couple. I never seen them in my life. \"I have heard of Thee with the ear, now I see Thee with my eye.\" [Job 42:5] If you can believe, God can furnish what you have need of.\n\nL-187 That man setting there with his hand up on his chin, with that high blood pressure. You believe God would make you well, sir? You do? Setting with your hand like this, you believe God will heal you of that high blood pressure? Raise up your hand, if you believe It. All right, He does it. I never seen the man in my life, I know nothing about him. But you heard that Jesus said, here in the Bible, that He would do these things, now you see it! You see what I mean? \"If thou canst believe, all things are possible.\" Only to them that believe! It takes real, genuine faith to do it. But if you can believe It, God will grant it. [Matthew 19:26], [Mark 9:23]\n\nL-188 There's a lady setting right back there, looking at me, got a goiter in her throat. Lady setting next by, setting next to her, that she'll understand, that lady there has high blood pressure, also. That's right. Lady setting next to her, she has a--a trouble, too. And she's not from here, she's from Arkansas. They're missing it. Miss Phillips, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be healed! Do you believe Him? With all your heart? You accept It? Right. Then you can have it. Now you say, \"That's mysterious.\" No! No! Jesus said, \"Your name is Simon, you're the son of Jonas.\" Is that right? [Luke 17:30] \"I have heard of Thee with my ear, now I see Thee with my eye.\" Now don't you see what happened? Someone just setting there, looking, believing, trusting, and all at once there it happens. See?\n\nL-189 Feeling better, son, tonight, than you did last night? Setting down? It's all right now, you're going to be well (uh-huh). Setting here last night, butting his head and everything else; now, tonight, he looks like a gentleman. See? He was a little bit confused about things, but it's all straightened out now. See? It'll be all right. See? \"And in that day, the Son of man is being revealed, see, just before Sodom is to be burned.\"\n\nL-190 \"I have heard of Thee with my ear, now I see Thee with my eye. I heard Jesus Christ say He promised that, I see that promise living right now.\" See? \"I have heard of Thee with my ear, now I see Him with my eye.\" How many believes That to be Him? (O God!)\n\nL-191 Now, while we're here... it's getting late. Tomorrow night we're going to have a great healing service. We're expecting Brother Moore and I to stand here and pray for every person that wants to come through the line. But I thought in speaking this tonight, I was just going to make the altar call. But then I thought, \"no,\" It said there, \"I have heard of Thee with the ear, now I want to see You with my eye.\" Now He's here. Do you believe that?\n\nL-192 Now let's lay our hands over on one another. Now, remember, the same One that promised He would do this, said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\" Did He say It? Are you a believer? Say, \"Amen.\" Well, then, the same God that made this promise that you see Him perform just now,... Ask any of those people, I never seen them, know nothing about them. I wouldn't know them right now, see, impossible for me to. But that Scripture's got to be fulfilled! Well, if that's fulfilled, it shows we're in the latter times, we'll know the Son of man is ready to be... to come, because He's revealing Himself in human flesh. Is that right? [Mark 16:17]\n\nL-193 Then we know it's true, and you say you're a believer on Him, and you got your hands laid on one another. And if your hands are laid on one another, that same Son of God which is here to make this come true to your eyes, the same Son is here to say, \"They shall recover!\" The same Son of God! \"I heard that He said, 'If the believers lay their hands on, they shall recover.' I heard it with my ears, now let me see it with my eyes. He promised to do it.\" Now while I pray, you pray. [Mark 16:18]\n\nL-194 Lord Jesus, in the Name of the Lord God of Heaven, let Your Spirit drop into these people's heart; that genuine 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min faith of God, that will confirm this promise to them. And may the God of Heaven heal every one of them, as they obey Your commandments by laying hands on each other. Let it be so, Lord. In the Name of Jesus Christ, grant that it will be so, for Your glory. Now, do you believe that you got what you asked for? Does something in your heart tell you? Do you feel that little speck of inspiration, said, \"Why, it's over! It's done!\"? The commandment of God said that we could hear it with our ear, now we can see it with our eye. Job said, \"I've heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear, but now I see Thee with my eyes.\"\n\nL-195 Now, you heard it by the Word, by the hearing of the Word, \"Faith cometh by hearing, hearing the Word.\" Now you see It act, with your eyes! Now, that same God that said that, when these things was to be taking place, that \"the believers on This would lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover.\" Now has it dropped into your heart that you're \"healed\"? Raise your hands if it did. Amen! That's real apostolic healing. You mean it? You believe It with all your heart? Hallelujah! That's all we need. Let's stand on our feet and give Him praise, then. [Romans 10:17]\n\nL-196 Thank You, Lord Jesus. Blessed be the Name of the Lord. I will praise Him! I will praise Him! Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory, all ye people, For His Blood has washed away each stain.\n\nL-197 Now, do you love Him? Now let's, all together, give Him glory, all ye people. Now, look, if that has been revealed to you by God, in the channel that you were saved in, the same channel that told you \"you were saved,\" the same channel God moved through, like He did through Job and the prophets, He's moved through you through that channel as a Christian, by His Divine revelation that \"you are healed,\" then there's nothing going to keep it from happening. So we give Him glory, all ye people, For His Blood has washed away each... (Every doubt; washed away every doubt.) I will praise Him! I will praise Him! Praise the Lamb for sinner slain; Give Him glory, all ye people, For His Blood has washed away each stain.\n\nL-198 Oh, don't you love Him? Ah, how wonderful. \"I have heard of Thee, Lord, with my ear, and faith cometh by hearing; but now I see Thee, God making Himself known among His people like He did to Abraham, by His promise here that the Son of man would reveal Himself in the days that the world become in a Sodom condition.\"\n\nL-199 And there was three messengers went forth, come down from Heaven. And there was a denominational group down in Sodom, and a Billy Graham and a Oral Roberts went down there. And remember as I've told you, no where in the history of the church has there ever been a messenger sent universal to the church, until now, with his name ending like Abraham, h-a-m. G-r-a-h-a-m, six letters, to the world, man's number. But Abraham had seven letters in the name, God's complete and perfect number. See? And notice what the messengers did that went out in there: preached the Word, called them out, told them to repent.\n\nL-200 But the One who stayed back with Abraham, see, performed a miracle by telling Abraham what Sarah was doing and thinking in the tent behind Him. And Jesus, who was the One that was in this person, said, \"When the world gets in a Sodom condition, like it was then, the Son of man will be revealed again.\" And all the other Scriptures confirming that to be so. The... \"In the beginning was the\" [Congregation says, \"Word,\"--Ed.] \"and the Word was with\" [\"God,\"] \"and the Word was\" [\"God.\"] \"And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\" Is that right? Now we see that same promised Word, of Luke, of Malachi, all these other promises from today, made flesh, dwelling among us, that we heard with our ears; now we see Him (with our eyes) interpreting His Own Word, we don't need any interpretation of man. O church of the living God, here and on the phones! wake up quick, before it's too late! God bless you. 65-1127E, I Have Heard But Now I See, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 116 min [Genesis 18:9-13], [Luke 17:28-30], [John 1:1, 14], [Malachi 4:5-6] I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me, And purchased my salvation On Calvary tree.\n\nL-201 Could you think, church, that you're looking with your own eyes... The living Word of God made manifest, the promise of the hour, in the last days, looking with your own eyes at the living Word being interpreted in natural form, God among us! \"I see Him with my own eyes, the One... I heard that He would do it.\" All the old sages looked for this day, now we see It manifested with our own eye. How many the old shouting Methodists, Baptists, and the real, genuine pentecostals in their age, longed to see this happen! Many of them knowed it would happen. But we stand tonight seeing it happen! Oh! Don't you love Him?\n\nL-202 Now, Jesus said, \"This will all men know you're My disciples, when you love one another.\" So as we love Him, let's shake one anothers' hands and sing I Will Praise Him! I Will Praise Him! All right. [John 13:35] I will praise Him! I will praise Him! O praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory, all... (How you do?)... people For His Blood has washed away each stain.\n\nL-203 What did the queen of Belteshazzar say before her king that night? \"There is a man in your kingdom that is a dissolver of doubts.\" And the Holy Ghost, tonight, is the dissolver of doubts! Do you believe that? [Brother Branham speaks to someone--Ed.] The dissolver of doubts! Now, the Blood of Christ takes away each stain, the stain of doubt. There's not a greater sin in the world than unbelief, \"For he that believeth not, is condemned already!\" Is that right? \"He that believeth not is condemned.\" There's only one sin, and that's unbelief. Smoking's not a sin, cursing's not a sin, committing adultery's not a sin, lying is not a sin; that isn't sin, that's the results of unbelief. Unbelief! You do it because you don't believe. If you do believe It, you don't do it. [John 3:18], [Daniel 5:11-12]\n\nL-204 Oh! Oh! What... Wonderful! And the Blood of the Lamb has washed away every doubt. We believe His Word, emphatically. We believe that the Word was made flesh. And we believe the Word is made flesh by the vindication of His Presence now to confirm His Word. Do you believe It? God bless you.\n\nL-205 We hope to see you here in the morning, for a great time in the Lord. Bow your heads now, and I give the service to Brother Lindsay. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

Dear Lord, we thank Thee tonight for the promise of the coming of the Lord Jesus, where we'll meet in a great meeting where it'll never end, of joys and songs, as we praise You through the--the ceaseless ages that is to come. We ask Your blessings upon the meeting tonight. We ask Your blessings upon this tabernacle, upon its staff, its pastors, its co-workers, co-pastors, and all.\n\nL-2 We ask You to bless these, Lord, who have come many miles to be in the meeting, lay Your hand of mercy upon them as they travel back to their homes. Grant it, Lord. May we meet many more times together in this place called the house of God, to worship. Bless those who are tuned in tonight, Lord, by the way of the telephone. May every unsaved person find Jesus Christ their Saviour, tonight; heal all the sick and the afflicted, Father, your servant is reporting for service, in Jesus' Name. Amen!\n\nL-3 The Lord bless each of you. So happy to be here tonight. I just got in when Brother Ernie was singing the last part of his song, On The Wings Of A Dove. Certainly beautiful poem, certainly beautiful, and I--I know it's timely. So now, we very thankful.\n\nL-4 And to all you people that's tuned in tonight out across the nation, I wished you were only here to see this a-waiting, expectations on the people's faces as they're jammed in the building tonight; having a wonderful time.\n\nL-5 We want to thank Brother Jack Moore, and Sister Moore, and Brother Noel, Brother Boutliere, Brother Brown, all these associates here, the whole tabernacle, the whole staff, for inviting us back.\n\nL-6 It was a... really a... kind of a... couldn't say a coincident, it was simply just the hand of God that worked it out. There's a brother here that had a dream sometime ago, about this thing happening, said I \"was standing in a pair of white trousers, in Indian moccasins.\" And that's just exactly the way I was standing when I called Brother Jack for the meeting here, just exactly, (at Carson, Colorado) Indian moccasins and a pair of white levi trousers on; Brother Leo, if you're listening in, I was just meeting you in a few minutes. So that's when the meeting took its birthplace, right there.\n\nL-7 Now it's Sunday night; I know many of you will drive all night tonight going home, some of you will be driving in the morning. I've got two days drive ahead of me. And so we--we won't hold you very long. And I've tried to make this an old-time night, the night that Brother Brown, and Brother Jack, and all of us that used to pray for the sick years ago, would pray for the sick in the same manner that we did then.\n\nL-8 Now, can you hear me back in the back? I just keep lowering these mikes because I am hoarse.\n\nL-9 And so I want to... Just a little something, this little incident's happened. Why, they was telling me a while ago that there was a brother, perhaps here in the meeting tonight, that just come out of denominationalism; come into Shreveport, wanted to hear about the Message. And he got mixed up, he didn't know where he was at, so he went downtown. He seen a people gathered, he said, \"Is this where Billy Branham is going to preach?\"\n\nL-10 He said, \"No, it's where Billy Graham's a-preaching by--by the way of a--a film.\"\n\nL-11 He said, \"Well, I'm sorry, I--I got the wrong place.\"\n\nL-12 He said he come up, he said, \"Now where can I go, Lord?\" Said he started walking up this main street. I don't know what it is, there's a big church up here at the end. Texas Street. And there was a big white cross up on a church. Said the Lord told him, said, \"'Just keep walking.'\" Said... when he got there, there was... Said, \"Well, here must be where it is, there's a lot of cars setting around.\" And said, \"A bride and groom come walking out of the church.\" That was last night, there was a wedding, I seen it come out. The Lord said, \"Now, that's what it is. You're coming out of denominationalism to enter into the Bride, to go with the Groom.\" See? See? [II Corinthians 6:17]\n\nL-13 I was remarking to my wife, coming down the street, how the moon and the star hanging right above that cross, as 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min we moved up into it. I guess I just look at little things like that, maybe kinda complimentary to my belief in God and my ministry.\n\nL-14 I was thinking tonight, in Tucson, it happened to be that Victor Le Doux, he was this Frenchman... he's a genuine Frenchman. I believe I was telling you the other day, that when I got through speaking, trying to separate denominationalism from real Christianity... And a man was giving me a... kind of a short talk about it, from a famous denominational Pentecostal church.\n\nL-15 And so Danny Henry, I think he's some movie star's cousin or something, and he was a Baptist; and he run down to the platform, and just threw his arms around me and said, \"Brother Branham, I hope this don't sound sacrilegious, but that could be the 23rd chapter of Revelation.\" And when he started to say something else, he started speaking in tongues.\n\nL-16 And this, three French people... A Frenchwoman (big, heavyset woman, dark complected, from Louisiana, she may be setting here tonight) wrote it down on a piece of paper, what he said. Then Victor Le Doux, a minister, wrote down the same thing; and they were comparing notes, or going to. A light-headed man (kind of a blond hair) standing way back, packed back as far as he could, come walking up, wanted to see those notes. He was the interpreter of French at the U.N. And all three notes was the same.\n\nL-17 And It said this: Because thou has chosen this harder way... You've chose it, you have took... chose it by your own choosing. (course we know that, Moses had to make his choice) (said) This is the precise and correct way, because it's MY WAY. And what a--what a glorious decision you've made!... (said)... Because of this, a large portion of Heaven awaits you. And this in itself is that which will make, and bring to pass, the tremendous victory in the Love Divine. [Matthew 7:14]\n\nL-18 All three was the same. I thought I had that in my Bible tonight, (I looked in there, but I didn't), the original copy of it.\n\nL-19 Danny Henry don't know... like myself, he hardly knows good English, let alone French. If you notice in there, it's like the French language, they put the verb before the adverb. And the interpretation of all three was exactly alike.\n\nL-20 Danny Henry, sometime ago, he make... Danny may be listening in tonight. Victor Le Doux perhaps is, because I understand he's in Tucson. And you people in Tucson at the church, the tabernacle, the Tucson Tabernacle where Brother Green's the pastor; Brother Victor Le Doux, I understand is in a tent meeting right at the foot of Park Avenue where it runs out into Highway 80, coming this a-way. And if you're out there tomorrow night and next night, whenever how long he'll be there, go to hear him; and Danny may be with him. And it could be that they're listening in from the tabernacle tonight, I don't know.\n\nL-21 Danny went to Jerusalem right after that, and said he was laying there in the tomb on the board... rock board that Jesus laid on, a corpse just before His resurrection. And said, all of a sudden I come on his mind; and said he run out, begin crying, and he walked outside. And he was directed... He's a man that makes things out of rocks; tumbles rocks, I meant. Said he went to where they said the cross was drove down, and he just dropped off... knocked off a little piece of rock about like... oh, a inch square, or something; put it in his pocket, and was impressed to bring it home.\n\nL-22 When he did, something said to him, \"Make Brother Branham a pair of cuff links out of that.\" So he put it in the acid, and it changed the color from the regular limestone-looking rock to a bloodstone rock. And he made the cuff links.\n\nL-23 And when he give them to me, he hadn't noticed it, but right through the middle of both cuff links runs that straight, narrow strip. I have them on tonight, to pray for the sick. See, a--a bloodstone color, like the dripping blood; with the straight, narrow line right through. Just exactly what his prophecy said, \"the straight and narrow way\"; see, in the prophecy. I showed it to him. [Matthew 7:14]\n\nL-24 Danny, if you're listening in, you or Brother Le Doux, either one, tonight's going to be the old-fashioned night when we're to pray for the sick. I'm glad to walk this straight, narrow way, the way of the Gospel, the way of the Word, with our Lord Jesus Christ. 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min\n\nL-25 God bless you all. Now, you're so nice to talk to, I'll just talk a long time and I'll have you here too long. Billy said there's between three and four hundred people to be prayed for, so I'll just have to hurry up with our message as quick as possible, and then pray for the sick.\n\nL-26 Now, to the people in Arizona, the next Saturday night, we're over at (never can think of the name of that town) Yuma, Arizona, at the banquet. So then, in California, we follow right on in Sunday morning, to Los Angeles and the places that's been predicted to be there.\n\nL-27 Tonight, I want to take a text out of the Scripture.\n\nL-28 By the way, I was setting in a cafeteria today, the Morrison's Cafeteria; Brother Jack, his wife, I and my wife. We went over to Morrison's Cafeteria to have a little time together, we hadn't been out, the women had never been together. There was a young fellow walked up to me, his name's Green, he's the father of Brother Pearry Green. And he said, \"You know, Brother Branham, you was talking about a 'johnny pin' the other night.\" That's really a... What is it? Bobby pin. He said, \"You were talking about a 'johnny pin,'\" said, \"I got you a 'johnny pin.'\" He gave it to me.\n\nL-29 Now, that's a \"johnny pin,\" ladies, that won't work in the hair. A \"johnny pin,\" he said--said he'd been using it for years, to hold the pages of his Bible down. So he said, \"I'll give you a genuine 'johnny pin.'\" So, Brother Green, if you're here somewhere or listening in, that \"johnny pin's\" a dandy, just holds it right.\n\nL-30 Now we want to get into the Scriptures right away. And I want you to turn with me now to Psalms 55, and then also Matthew 3. And my subject tonight was Brother Ernie's topic: On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove. Now, I won't be able to strike all the notes and Scriptures that I got here, because I'll just kinda skip over a few of them, and because I promised the message.\n\nL-31 The Lord willing, for Yuma next Saturday night, I want to preach on: The Conditions For The Rapture, if the Lord willing.\n\nL-32 In Psalms 53... I beg your pardon, Psalms 55. Give ear... (Pardon? 55, yes, sir.) Give ear to my prayer, O God;... hide not thyself from my supplication. Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise; Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. My heart is sore pained within me: and the terror of death are fallen upon me. Fearless and trembling comings are come upon me, the horror has overwhelmed me. And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest. Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah. (Selah means \"Amen.\") [Psalms 55:1-7]\n\nL-33 David, a lover of the wilderness, when he got distressed and the people wouldn't believe him, and the enemies had come upon him, he said, \"If I had the wings of a dove, I would fly out into the wilderness and there remain.\" How many times have I thought that same thing! If I could take my rifle off of the wall, my camp bag, go out in the wilderness and never return again. I've asked the Lord if I can live to see the day... I don't never want a funeral service, I said, \"If I can just go out in the woods somewhere, set old 'Blondie' against the tree,...\"\n\nL-34 That's my rifle, excuse me, I--I--I say that on account of my wife setting there. You know, that rifle a Brother here gave me years ago, I killed fifty-five head of game with it, without missing a shot, some of them seven to eight hundred yards. I call it \"Blondie\" because my wife's a brunette, so she said I think more of the rifle than I do her. But...\n\nL-35 So, I--I'd like to set it against a tree, and say, \"Lord, let Joseph find it someday.\" I'd like to take the wings of a dove and fly away.\n\nL-36 But just like one time up in the mountains and watching an eagle, and seeing him fly away (you know my story of it), I said, \"It's good to be here, Lord; like Peter said, 'we could build three tabernacles.' But down at the foot of the mountain, the sick and the afflicted are waiting, the lost and dying are waiting.\" So let us do what we can while it's day, 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min and someday there'll be a... the wings of a white Eagle will come down, He'll bear us away. [Matthew 17:4], [Mark 9:5], [Luke 9:33]\n\nL-37 Now in Matthew 3:16, I'd like to read 16 and 17. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went straightway up out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. (In other words, \"in whom I'm pleased to dwell in.\") [Matthew 3:16-17]\n\nL-38 Now we want to speak a few minutes on this bird. A dove has always been one of my favorite birds. And thinking of a dove, a dove is really... and a pigeon is the same bird. A pigeon is a domestic dove. They're both the same family. I've looked it up and it is the same family. A pigeon and a dove, they're both of the same family. The habits of these birds are outstanding.\n\nL-39 I preached here, some few years ago, in a tent meeting out here with Brother Moore, on: The Lamb And The Dove. I guess you all remember that; and how that the dove is the most cleanest bird that we have, and the lamb is the most meekest animal that we have. They're both sacrificial bird and beast.\n\nL-40 How beautiful it's typed here as Jesus being the Lamb, and God being the Dove. And the dove would not have settled on a wolf, his nature's not right. It couldn't a-settled on a dog, his nature's not right. It had to be on a lamb; the two natures had to be the same. And that's the way we have to be, our natures has to change from the roaring sinner to the meekness of a lamb. [John 1:29-32]\n\nL-41 And did you notice the Dove led the Lamb? And notice, the Lamb forfeit everything He had to the Dove. And look where the Dove led Him: to crucifixion for the sins of us all.\n\nL-42 Now, the Dove of... God wanted to represent His Son, He was represented by the most cleanest and meekest animal on the earth, a earth-bound creature; but when God represented Himself in the heavens, was by the meekest and most cleanest bird there is in the heavens, a dove. [Luke 3:21-22]\n\nL-43 Now, doves vary, there's many different variations of them. Usually our turtledove is kind of a gray-looking bird. And then there's a mourning dove, and then there's the evening dove. There's also called the sonora dove that we have at home, he's a little, gray fellow; little, bitty fellow with red stripes on his wings. There's many different kinds of doves, and they vary in colors. So is there same thing in the pigeons.\n\nL-44 Now, the dove is a very odd constructed dove, because his habit's that he cannot eat anything that's unclean; he just couldn't do it, because he's not built for it. [I John 3:9]\n\nL-45 Now, I've always talked about the dove being the symbol of God, and the crow being the symbol of a hypocrite. A crow can set out on an old dead carcass and eat, all day long, and fly right out in the field and eat wheat with the dove. But the dove can eat wheat all right, but it can't eat the dead carcass. See? He just can't do it, he can't stomach it. And I wondered why he couldn't do it; they're both fowls, both birds. But why? It's the structure of them. [John 1:32]\n\nL-46 And that's the way it is with a genuine Christian. A... just a denominational Christian can just take anything, but a genuine, borned-again Christian cannot take the things of the world. He's constructed different.\n\nL-47 I found out that the dove don't have any gall. There's no gall in a dove because he has no need of it.\n\nL-48 So that's the way it is with a Christian, he doesn't need any bitterness, see, 'cause. he only can eat the food of God. And it doesn't take bitterness to dissolve that; takes love, see, so he... to dissolve the food. Bitterness: \"Oh,\" they say, \"well...\" they difference with It. But love always receives It, the Word of God. [Ephesians 4:31]\n\nL-49 Now, he has no gall, so therefore he could not... it's just against him to eat anything bad. And if he would, it would kill him. But there's no danger, he isn't going to eat it (uh-huh), because he has no appetite for it.\n\nL-50 And that's the way with a real Christian. Did you know a real Christian doesn't have even any sin at all imputed to him? David said, \"Blessed is the man who God will not impute sin to.\" When you're washed in the Blood of the Lamb (not by make-belief, but really the--the Blood of the Lamb), God does not impute to you anything that's done, because 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min you're under the Blood and He doesn't see it. There's a Blood sacrifice; the only thing He can see you in, is the way He saw you before the foundation of the world when He put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life. That's all He can look at, because you are redeemed from everything that was ever done, you're washed in the Blood of the Lamb. Therefore there's no gall in you, there's no unclean habit in you, because that the Blood of the Lamb has did this; and God cannot impute sin to you after you've got a sin-offering laying there waiting for you. [Romans 4:8], [Exodus 12:13], [Revelation 21:27]\n\nL-51 \"Well,\" you say, \"that gives me plenty of room then, Brother Branham, I can do what I want to.\" I always do; always. But when a man can really see what Jesus done for him, and turn around and do something contrary to Him, it shows he never received Christ.\n\nL-52 I got a little wife setting back there. She's ten years younger than me, and is gray as I am. The reason is because she's stood between me and the--and the outside world. If I was going overseas, and I'd... Wouldn't this be some sort of a family to live in, if I'd gather my family around me and I'd say: \"Looky here, Mrs. Branham, you want to realize that you're Mrs. William Branham. Thou shalt not have any other husbands while I'm gone. Don't you make eyes at any other man,\" and all these things. \"Don't you flirt at all. If you do, when I come back I'm going to divorce you.\"\n\nL-53 And she'd turn around and say, \"Now, my good man, I want to tell you something also. Thou shalt not take out any other woman while you're gone. Thou shalt not do this and that. If you do, just consider yourself divorced when you come home.\"\n\nL-54 Now, wouldn't that be a loving family? See? No! If I really love her... Though I believe if I did make a mistake and slip and do something wrong, I believe she'd forgive me for it because she loves me. And if she did, I believe I'd forgive her for it; certainly, because I love her. But if I love her like that, as long as I love her like that she has no worry. Though she would forgive me, I wouldn't hurt her for nothing. I--I--I'd feel the guiltiest guy in the world, I couldn't wait for the minute I'd tell her about what I done, because I love her. Well, that's... If I love her with phileo love like that, how much greater would my agapao love be to Jesus Christ?\n\nL-55 Though I might smoke a cigarette, I never in my life; but though I would, He might forgive me for it, I believe He would. If I took a drink, I never in my life, but I believe He'd forgive me for it. And I love Him too much, (God, help me) I don't want to do anything like that, see, because I love Him. That stuff is gone from me, because when He changed me from a crow to a dove it made a difference, my appetite and things left me; then sin is not imputed to me because I don't aim to do it, it's not in me to do it. [II Corinthians 5:17]\n\nL-56 Now another great thing about this dove. He's a strange bird. Did you ever see all the birds...\n\nL-57 One of my favorite birds is a robin. Now, you boys quit shooting at my robins, see, 'cause I don't want you doing that. My robin, you know how he got his red breast? You know, one day there was a Man dying on the cross, nobody would help Him, God had forsaken the Man, and He was dying. His hands had nails in them, his feet and his side a-bleeding, crown on His head and thorns, blood running over His face. And there was a little bird passed by, a little, brown bird. And he looked at that, was... thought it was the most pitiful sight he ever saw. And he knowed he was just a little bird, but he looked at them great big, ol' cruel Roman nails drove in His hand, and he flew in with his little beak and tried to pull them loose. He got his breast all bathed with blood, since then it's been red. I want my breast shielded with His Blood, too, defending It when I come to meet Him. I love a little robin. [Matthew 27:46]\n\nL-58 But, you know, a little robin has to take a bath; but, you know, a dove don't have to; no. He's got some kind of oil on the inside of him that oils him and keeps him clean from the inside out. You know that? The dove has! The dove oils himself. Did you ever pick up one, smell that odor on him, a pigeon or something? That's oil that's produced from the inside of him. His body makes up a oil gland that keeps his feathers always clean on the outside because he's clean from inside out. That's right. He's a marvelous little bird.\n\nL-59 Now, I know you can hunt them here, I think, in Louisiana. Don't do that! Oh, I couldn't do it. I guess if I was hungry, it'd be all right, but I--I just couldn't pull the trigger on one if I had to.\n\nL-60 There's... A dove has a great strange thing in our family. One day when my grandmother... She come from up here 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min in Kentucky, off the Cherokee reservation. She was dying, a little woman, and she was... They had... I think they call it scrofula or something, she was dying. And grandfather knelt down by the side of the bed; while Mama, Aunt Birtie, Aunt Howlie, all of them knelt around the bed; Uncle Charlie, (little bitty, four-year-old boy) the baby; Mama, the oldest, being about twelve years old. And she had combed her black hair out on the bed, and she started singing, \"Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in Thee,\" when she was dying. Grandpa, at that time, wasn't a Christian. I baptized him at eighty-seven years old, in the Name of Jesus Christ, at the foot of the river there where the Angel of the Lord appeared.\n\nL-61 But while she was singing this song, with her feeble little hands up in the air, a dove flew in the door; come around, set down on the top of the bed, started cooing. God took her soul.\n\nL-62 I went over to London, England with Brother Jack and with Brother Gordon Lindsay, and there had been a woman by the name of Florence Nightingale (claims to be, I think, a great-granddaughter or something of the late Florence Nightingale) that wrote me many letters. She was down in South Africa, dying with a cancer. And she had a picture; you seen it in the book. I never seen a mortal like that in my life. Brother Jack, I believe, was with me that day. We went into a minister's house, at the rectory, just behind the church where they had brought her.\n\nL-63 While we were yet out on the... where the plane come down, they paged us, and she was in a ambulance there then; had been flown up from--from down in South Africa, knowing that I was coming to England at that time. The minister took her to the rectory, so we went back there to pray for her.\n\nL-64 I've seen lots of sick people, but her little arms didn't look over a inch across, her--her skull where it laces together, you could see it. And she... her limbs way up here around her hips wasn't over that, about two inches across, just the bone. And she couldn't raise her hands, she was too weak to raise her hands. And she was trying to say something, and I couldn't understand her. And when I finally got to hear, I believe through a nurse, she said, \"Brother Branham, pray that God will let me die.\" She couldn't... didn't want to live. And I noticed, and tears was running off of the side of them bone on her face. Where she got enough moisture about her to cry, I don't know; for her veins was collapsed, and she was in a terrible condition. Coming to pray for the sick, I couldn't pray for her to die. But she just looked like couldn't die, she just lingering on.\n\nL-65 I knelt down with your pastor, in the room to pray. And when I knelt down to pray, a little dove flew up by the window; begin cooing. When I finished praying, I thought it was a pet dove there somewhere. Foggy outside, how England is, the British Isles there. And this little dove quit cooing, and flew away. I walked over and laid hands upon her and called the Name of the Lord. And the woman is a great big, strong healthy woman today, on the wings of a Dove. [Mark 16:18]\n\nL-66 He keeps hisself clean from the inside. A Christian does that too, he cleans from the inside. That keeps the malice... He don't need any gall to digest anything, because he doesn't eat it. See? He's clean from the inside out.\n\nL-67 Now, we notice that this bird... Many things I've got written down here, but the clock keeps moving around. This bird was also used in the Old Testament for sacrifice, for an atonement and for cleansing. Let's just refer here to one in Genesis 15:9. Let's think of this verse just for a moment. Now, Abraham was... asked God here, how would He do this. And God is making His Word back to Abraham, and He does it in a strange way. Begin with about the... Let's begin at the lst verse, I don't like to hurry this. After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abraham in a vision,... (See, Abraham was a prophet, so he saw visions.)... Fear not, Abraham: I am thy shield, and... exceeding reward. (Jehovah-nissi, see.) And Abraham said, Lo-... said, Lord GOD... (Notice, capital L, \"Lord GOD.\" Elohim! See?)... Lord GOD,... (in the vision)... what will thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? And Abram said, Behold, to me thou has given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is my heir. And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, This shall not be thy heir;... Done made him a promise, you know. Not... See, right then Abraham would have failed, but the promise is unconditional; the covenant, unconditional. 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min ... but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. (And he's a hundred years old now.) And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now towards the heavens, and tell the stars, if thou are able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. (A man without a child, and now a hundred years old.) And he believed in the LORD; and it was counted unto him for righteousness. And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur, out of the Chaldeans, to give thee the land to inherit it. And he said unto Him, Lo-... Lord... or Lord... whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? [Genesis 15:1-8]\n\nL-68 Now listen to this. And he said unto him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old,... (watch the threes now, \"three years old\")... and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. (Both the same people, both the same thing. See, it was used in a sacrifice that he was foreshowing Jesus.)\n\nL-69 The covenant was made... You know, how he cleave them apart, and how that this...\n\nL-70 Or the old times, when they took... made a covenant, they would take and write the--the agreement up. And kill an animal, stand in between it; tear the covenant in two, one person took one part...\n\nL-71 Like the Chinese laundry used to do. The Chinaman here, he couldn't write English, so he wrote on there and tore a piece of paper and handed you a part. And you--you remember the Chinese laundries when they used to do that. And you... their--their two ends had to compare, to get your clothes. See, you couldn't fool him, 'cause he had the other end of it. You might re-copy your name, but you can't retear that paper. See? So, he had... it had to be the same piece of paper.\n\nL-72 So that's the way they done it in the Oriental days, long... or long ago in the Eastern days. They'd kill an animal, stand in between it, tear the piece of goatskin apart, one took one... And when the covenant was confirmed, they brought the pieces together and they had to dovetail just exactly.\n\nL-73 Now, what God is showing him here is this, on these sacrifices, is speaking of Christ; that how God took Jesus to the Calvary and tore Him apart, and received the body up into Heaven and sent the Spirit down upon us, that the same Spirit was on Him has to be on you to dovetail with the Body, to be the Bride at the end time. See? See? That's right. See? Won't be a denomination, now. It'll be the Word, what He was. See? [Luke 23:33]\n\nL-74 But like that Word has to come to Word, like cell in a human being. You know, when your--your body's being built, it isn't one cell of a human, next of a dog, and next of a pig. Oh, no, no. It's all human cell. That's the way the Body of Christ is, all the Word of God. Not just part of It, some tradition added to It; no, It's all the Body of Christ.\n\nL-75 Now, we find here that he used both a turtledove and a young pigeon, because they are the selfsame family. Now, you always...\n\nL-76 So notice (I just refer to a couple of these Scriptures) Leviticus 12, and the 6th verse. We find here that the order of a woman being purified; if the woman had a baby, she had to wait. If it was a boy, she had to wait for thirty-three days before she could enter the congregation with the doves, for purification. If she had a girl, she had to wait ninety-six days before she could enter the congregation. [Leviticus 12:6]\n\nL-77 Now we find here, the 6th verse. And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:\n\nL-78 See, she can't come in yet because her days isn't finished yet, but she can give this to the--the priest at the door, for her offering. See, either a turtledove or a young pigeon. They're both the same family. 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min\n\nL-79 Now it--now it was used for atonements, and in the atonement for sin, one dove. Or of leprosy, which is a type of sin, you brought two doves: one's head was taken off, turned upside down and bled on the other one; and then the other dove was set free. And when the dove flew, he bathed the ground with his blood of his mate, and the blood cried out to God, \"Holy! Holy! Holy is the Lord God!\" [Genesis 15:9]\n\nL-80 Can't you see the dying mate Jesus Christ? Was killed and sprinkled upon us, that we should go free, crying out \"Holy! Holy! Holy! unto the Lord.\" What beautiful types. Wished I had some voice.\n\nL-81 Now type the great Holy Spirit as we just read in Revelation 3:16; used of God for signs, this dove was.\n\nL-82 Noah was given a sign, as the brother just sang about it. God was displeased, and there was nothing going to stay His wrath, for He said, \"The day you eat thereof, that day you die.\" And Noah had found grace with God and had built an ark according to the constructions... the instructions, rather, that He had given him. And he had been floated up. [Genesis 2:17], [Genesis 6:8], [Genesis 6:14-16]\n\nL-83 I can imagine his... what happened in them days when they said, \"This old man up on the hill, an old fanatic, building an ark, saying 'it's going to rain,' and it never has rained.\" But it...\n\nL-84 Noah said, \"It's going to rain, anyhow.\"\n\nL-85 And then I know the day that he went in, I think what... can't think of what day it was, I believe the seventeenth day of May. Noah entered into the ark, and God shut the door.\n\nL-86 And the clouds begin to come, the rains begin to fall, the sewers begin to fill up, the fountains of the deep broke up, the springs all belched up their water. Finally people got into the houses, climbed up. The old ark set right there just the same.\n\nL-87 After while when enough begin to get around her, she begin to rise up higher and higher. The people knocked at the doors and screamed, but it did no--no good, Noah could not open the door. God closed it, God's the only one can open it.\n\nL-88 So is it at our Ark, Jesus Christ; God opened the door for us on Calvary, He'll close it just as sure as He opened it.\n\nL-89 And it floated, and on and on, maybe a mile's deep over the top of the earth when this earth was tumbling out from the way... from the--the... its regular orbit. And around and around it went, and chunks, and trees, and above the mountains and so forth, pitching for forty days and nights.\n\nL-90 And when the winds being to cease...\n\nL-91 God's wrath is horrible. His love is pure and Divine; and His wrath is just as Divine--just as Divine as His love is, because, He must pass judgment because He is a judge. He's a law-giver, and law without penalty is not law. So there must be a penalty to law. And you transgress God's laws, that's when you pay the penalty. [Hebrews 10:31]\n\nL-92 Now we notice that after Noah floating up there, no doubt seasick from all that roaring and popping, and the wrath of God mashing and crushing, and screams and so forth. Then it begin to quieten down, nothing happened. Days passed, nothing happened. Perhaps the food supply for the animals and so forth running low, nothing happened. So he thought, \"Wonder... I can't see out.\"\n\nL-93 The ark was so constructed (when you were once in it), there was only one window in it, and it was right in the top. You couldn't look sideways, you couldn't look no way but straight up. And that's the way the Ark, Jesus Christ, is. You can't look at the next fellow, you can't look at nothing but Christ when you're in the Ark because there's only one door, and He is that Door we talked about this morning. You have to keep looking up, \"For he that will put his hand to the plow and even turn to look back, is not worthy of the plowing.\" [Genesis 6:16], [Luke 9:62]\n\nL-94 Now, as in this ark... And he could see light, and perhaps sunlight, but he wondered where he was. The ark was still a-floating, he could hear the waves against the sides, but he knew that there'd been many days, surely the water was receding by that time. So he went and got an untrusted bird, treacherous, and he tried him, and he sent him out. He was a crow, and that crow never did return, because he found pleasure out there, outside the ark of God. He flew from 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min one old dead body to another, eating the carcasses and the a-carrion that was floating on the water; and he was perfectly satisfied. [Genesis 8:6-12]\n\nL-95 So after several days he tried again, for he knowed... He didn't want to step out in the wrath of God. So he turned a dove loose. And this dove was of a different nature than the... It was not a vulture, neither is it a scavenger, it can only eat the clean pure things. And it was so satisfied because it couldn't find nothing else to put the soles of his feet on, it returned back to the ark. Noah said, \"Well, the flood's still on.\"\n\nL-96 Then he waited several other days, and he sent out again; like his prayer, \"O God, has Your wrath been appeased? Is--is--is Your wrath over, Lord? Is it all done?\" And he said, \"Now, if I send her out this time, she may stay out there if the floods are down, she may stay.\" But he sent her out by prayer, and then when she went out there directed by God, she picked off a holly leaf off of a tree, and flew back and pecked on the window again. [Genesis 8:11]\n\nL-97 God used a dove for a sign. She come back saying that \"the flood is over,\" and then God opened the door, and they went out. That's Genesis 8:8.\n\nL-98 Also used in Matthew 3:16, again when God's wrath was on the earth. And there was no way, the darkest of night, midnight, the churches had got things in such a twist till there was no way to get out of it. And there was false teachers, all kinds of things coming up, all kinds of professions coming up, but God used a dove again. It pleased Him, His Son Jesus had pleased Him so well, that He identified Him. [Matthew 3:17]\n\nL-99 Now, they couldn't believe that this baby that was borned down there in that stable in a manger of hay... before his father and mother, supposingly to be, was married. They couldn't imagine God using anything like that. So He had to be identified to the world; and that day down on the river, when He walked down to prove Hisself God's Masterpiece (that I talked about this morning)... When He was obedient to walk into the water... [Matthew 3:14-15]\n\nL-100 Now, if you notice there, there's a great lesson. John was the greatest man on earth, at the time. Jesus said, \"There never was a man borned of a woman as great as he,\" to that time. And he was a prophet. You believe that? Now, remember, if the Word of God will come to anything in the land, it'll be a prophet. That's always God's way. Do you believe that Jesus was the Word manifested in flesh? So there's only one way He can come to be introduced; not by the priests. [Matthew 11:11], [John 1:14]\n\nL-101 He didn't go up and say, \"Caiaphas, will you introduce Me?\" If He did, He made the same mistake that David did in our lesson the other day; see, if He went up to the church, and said, \"Will you introduce Me?\" [I Timothy 3:16]\n\nL-102 Just notice when He was borned, even. When He was borned, He was borned in the shadow of the church. And they was probably rang the bells and everything, but it was shepherds that recognized Him, and Magi. See? [Luke 2:15-18], [Matthew 2:9-11]\n\nL-103 And here He is now, on... ready for His ministry. And if He is the Word...\n\nL-104 According to God's great plan, the Word can only... \"The Lord God does nothing until He first reveals It to His servants the prophets.\" That's always His pattern, has to be; when the Seals were opened, when anything else. Any major event taking place in the earth, God reveals it to His prophets. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-105 And John was the prophet, for he was prophesying \"He'd come.\"\n\nL-106 Then down off the side of a hill one day... when a discussion was going on, a bunch of priests standing around. And they said, \"Do you mean to tell me that you call yourself a 'prophet,' and stand over there in that mud?\" (not in a church, because they wouldn't have him) \"Stand over in that mud, and tell me that the hour's coming when the great Jehovah who ordained these sacrifices, when great Jehovah who built this temple, who came into it as a Pillar of Fire, 'the day will come when that daily sacrifice will be taken away'?\" [Mark 1:6-8], [Luke 3:16-18]\n\nL-107 He said, \"There will come a Man, and He's among you now (somewhere out there), and He will take away the sin.\" The priest was disgusted with him. [John 1:29]\n\nL-108 John looked up! Now, what is he? The prophet! And here is the Word, there comes the Word coming right straight to the prophet, right to the water. John said, \"Behold, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min There He is, that's Him.\" Jesus never spoke a word, walked right out into the water. And I can see there, standing in that water (think of a drama), two of the greatest that ever struck the earth: God the Word, and His prophet. [John 1:29]\n\nL-109 Notice, the Word come to the prophet in this dispensation of grace, in the water (uh-huh). I thought you'd catch it (uh-huh). In the water! The first revelation of the Word was in the water. Now you see where the Bride started, the Evening-light Message? In the water! The Word, true Word not mixed up with creeds, but come to the prophet in the water, by the water. [Colossians 1:25]\n\nL-110 Notice! Could you imagine the eyes of the Word and the eyes of the prophet meeting in the water? Oh, that's too much for me. There stood the prophet, there stood the Word, looking in each others' eyes. And the prophet said, \"I have need to be baptized of Thee, why comest Thou unto me?\" [Matthew 3:14-15]\n\nL-111 And the Word said... It has to be true. Now let me give a drama here:\n\nL-112 \"John, you're a prophet, you know the Word.\" See? \"You recognize Me, you know Who I am.\"\n\nL-113 \"I have need to be baptized of Thee,\" John said.\n\nL-114 Jesus said, \"Suffer that to be so. That's exactly right, you do have need to be baptized of Me. But remember, John, being a prophet, it is behooving to us, or becoming to us (as the Word and the prophet), that we fulfill every Word. Uh-huh. For, John,\" (here's the revelation now) \"John, you know Who I am, I am the Sacrifice. And according to the Word of God, the sacrifice had to be washed before it was presented for sacrifice.\" Is that right? The Word... \"The lamb was washed and then presented for sacrifice, and I am that Lamb. And I must be washed before I can be presented to the world for a sacrifice. Suffer it to be so, John, for thus it is becoming to us as the Word and the prophet together.\" [Matthew 3:14-15]\n\nL-115 Well, there can't be a mistake. Now, everyone of these things...\n\nL-116 Now, see, if it wasn't that very setup, John would've been like any of the rest of us; so they say, \"Yeah, I--I know who You are, Lord.\"\n\nL-117 \"Well,\" He said, \"wait a minute, I'm the Word. Uh-huh. 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word.' Eve left off one uh-huh, but you got to take every Word. And I am that Sacrifice, and I must be washed before I'm presented. But what you said, John, is true.\" [Matthew 4:4], [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-118 John being a prophet, knowing the Word had to be fulfilled, he suffered that and baptized Him. And when He was raised up out of the water, there come the Message from Heaven on the wings of a Dove, \"This is My beloved Son.\" He sent the redemption Message of grace on the wings of a Dove, come flying down out of the heavens. \"Peace on earth, good will toward man.\" The Sacrifice was ready right then; been raised, fed, His ministry was ready, a Word that would redeem the whole world, \"It's over!\" [Matthew 3:17], [Mark 1:11], [Luke 3:22], [Luke 2:14]\n\nL-119 The dove is used in the Bible as a symbol of peace, and also it's used by nations as a symbol of peace. We have nations... Our nation is represented by an eagle. And there's other birds of other nations, Rome has an eagle, Germany has an eagle; many of them, great birds of the sky. But in all of them, the dove symbolizes peace in all nations. It's a universal thing.\n\nL-120 Just like Brother Green said one night, Brother Pearry Green said, \"The symbol of surrender is 'raise your hand.' Any nation, raise up your hand, it's surrender.\" He said, \"When you sing, raise up your hands, you surrender it all.\"\n\nL-121 And the dove is the symbol of peace in every nation. Why is it done? Because of its gentleness, and because of its innocence. That's the reason it symbols peace.\n\nL-122 Another thing about the dove, it is a home-loving bird. It loves to stay home.\n\nL-123 And another thing it is, it's always loyal to its mate. The dove, male or female, never leave one another. That female finds her mate in mating season. See, that's complimentary to God's great creation. That's the reason He made Eve a by-product. See? If she'd a-been made like other females, when the time come for her mating time, she'd a-found her mate; but she could any time. See? And that's the way, that's what it is. I just... We don't want to go into that, 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min because I've got it on Marriage And Divorce, and so forth. And how it... But yet she's honorable and brought that virtue, and you know how I preached on it the other night. All right, notice, she's got a great responsibility. [Genesis 2:21-22], [I Timothy 2:13]\n\nL-124 But the dove is always loyal to his mate. Always! Never leaves her.\n\nL-125 And may I stop here just for a minute, to say this: a true Bride, female dove, is loyal to her Mate, too. It won't inject any dogma, any denominational doctrines, anything of the world. It'll stay loyal to its Mate, the Word; always loyal.\n\nL-126 And by this home-loving conduct, by the conduct of its home-loving, it has been successfully used for a carrier pigeon. Because it loves home, you turn it loose anywhere, it'll always go back home. It'll go back home.\n\nL-127 We'd like to stress on that a little while, and you Christians would understand what I mean. It always finds its way back home, so therefore it's been used for carrier pigeon. It's used in time of war, used to be; they still use them, carrier pigeons to carry a message. So you see then, that makes the dove, both by God and man, a messenger; a dove is a messenger. It was a messenger to Noah, to tell Noah that \"there's peace again.\" It was used by God to vindicate that this was His Son, \"the Sacrifice to bring peace upon the earth and goodwill to man.\" It was used as a messenger. [Genesis 8:11], [John 1:32]\n\nL-128 Right here I have a little story in my mind, I read one time out of a book. Now, I don't want to say this is sure, it may be in The Decline of the First World War. I'm not positive of that now; if you miss seeing it, then I'm wrong. I either read it in a book... it's been many years ago. But it was certainly a--a... really a--a dramatic thing that happened.\n\nL-129 The American soldiers was pinned down by German machine-gun fire, and they were in kind of a pit. You soldiers, I guess, understand how they were on a reconnaissance somewhere. And they was pinned down, and they had just a little bit of ammunition left. And the Germans was moving in great units, moving in everywhere. And they knowed that unless they'd get some reinforcement, some help, that they would soon all die; (they had to) the Germans coming right down off the mountain, looking right down their neck, going right into them like that.\n\nL-130 And one of them happened to remember that he had a little mascot, a little pigeon. So he knew that this pigeon, if it could get out of there, would carry the message to the main headquarters to where they'd been stationed. And so they set down and wrote on a note, \"We are pinned down in a certain position at a certain area. We're out of ammunition, in a few hours we'll have to surrender or either we'll be massacred.\" And they pinned this, or tied it on the--the foot of this little dove and turned him loose.\n\nL-131 Now, he's a home-loving bird, so he... what does he do? He takes back home for his... meet, find his mate. She was worried about him, he'd have to come back home.\n\nL-132 And as he went up, the Germans seen what had happened. So the thing they done, they started shooting at the dove. And one of them hit him with a.30 caliber machine gun, or bullet, it broke his leg. Another one tore a big hunk out of his back. His chest was bruised all the way across. One of his wings was crippled, the end shot off of it, and he flew sideways. But he kept climbing, and finally he made it. Crippled, wounded, broken, bruised, but he fell in the camp with the message. That was a great dove.\n\nL-133 But, oh, brother, Isaiah 53 tells us of One, came down from Home and all that was good. And he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquity: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we were healed. [Isaiah 53:5]\n\nL-134 Sickness, superstition, and devils had us pinned down, there was no way out, the church had gone wrong, they had went off on denominational things (and the Pharisees, Sadducees, and washing of pots and pans), and the Word of God become of no effect. But this little Dove came down, and there's only one thing could take place: there had to be a redeemer.\n\nL-135 But being wounded, broken, beaten, torn, but He knowed His way back Home. So from Calvary's cross where they bruised Him, mashed Him, tore Him, like a bunch of wolves upon Him, He made His flight from Calvary and He 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min landed in Heaven's doors, saying, \"It's finished! It's finished! They are free! Sickness can be healed now! Sinners can be saved! The captive can be set free!\" [John 19:30]\n\nL-136 Though He was bruised and wounded, that great battle there when even everything against Him... Even the poet cried out: Mid rendering rocks and darkening skies, My Saviour bowed His head and died; But the opening veil revealed the way To Heaven's joy and endless day.\n\nL-137 I've been a neurotic all my life. As a little boy there was something struck me, that scare me, about every seven years it would happen to me. Brother Jack remembers when I first started, come off the field for a year; something just happened.\n\nL-138 I remember the day that Juanita Hemphill... I think her name's Juanita Kelly now, she married Brother Kelly after the death of her husband. Anna Jeanne, I've got their pictures and things, they were such... And her... And them two girls and Sister Moore had a--a little trio. They sang that song that I never forget: Looking Beyond The Sunset. Brother Jack, you remember, I guess, coming up from Florida. What fine little girls.\n\nL-139 And I remember that morning a little Pentecostal group from up here in northern part of the country, in Michigan somewhere, those girls stood out there when Brother Hooper... I seen him here the other night, I... he may not be here now, Brother Ed Hooper. Are you here, Brother Ed? I don't think he... He set here the other night. None... Many of you know him. He and I, and Brother Hooley, we was leaving. And those girls standing there on the corner singing that, gave us, each one, a yellow rose that they took out of their hair. (That's where that maniac had been healed down there, great things had took place.)\n\nL-140 Coming up the road just as happy as I could be, all of a sudden it struck me; a year later 'fore I entered the field again, just killed me.\n\nL-141 Since a little boy, I always said I didn't know what a vision was. A little boy, I always said, \"If I--if I'd only fall in one of those trance, and see that, I'd get well.\" That time... I always wanted to go to Mayo's to find out what was wrong. The doctors there...\n\nL-142 My stomach gets sour; and oh, my! Brother Jack's helped me around the house. I walk right around the house; and just a hot greasy water like, flying out of my mouth. And walk to the pulpit, and pray for people that was twice that bad, and be healed. I've had them lay my hands on a man with a cancer on his face, and the cancer left his face, standing there; and I was so sick I couldn't stand up.\n\nL-143 And you don't know what I've suffered; just mental oppression. Every seven years it's come, all my life. That's where I'm at now, seven eights.\n\nL-144 So I was--I was so distressed; I cried, I begged, I pleaded.\n\nL-145 And I remember when I finally thought I had enough money to go to Mayo's for an examination; they said, \"They'll find what your trouble is.\" Wife and I, and Becky back there... Sarah was a little, bitty fellow. I had just entered my healing ministry. And we took off to Mayo's.\n\nL-146 I went through the clinic. And the night before I'd find... had my finals the next morning, I just woke up and was setting there on the bed looking around. And I looked out in front of me, and there was a little boy, looked just like me, about seven years old; and looked at it, and it was me. And he was standing by an old snag tree. And on that tree...\n\nL-147 Any of you squirrel hunters know you can rub a stick up and down on a tree like that, and it'll scare a squirrel and run him out if he's in the hollow.\n\nL-148 And I was seeing there where that squirrel had been, and I thought, \"What kind of squirrel is that?\" and I rubbed it. And when I did, I looked over and it was me then about thirty-eight years old, the little boy was gone. So I rubbed that limb, and out of the hollow log, pole, come a little squirrel about that long, dark, almost black, and looked like 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min little currents flying from him; little bitty beady eyes, the wickedest looking thing that I ever seen, looked like a weasel more than a squirrel.\n\nL-149 And he looked right at me. And I opened my mouth to say, \"Well...\" And when I did, he... Before you could've batted your eye, he flew right into my mouth, went down into my stomach, and just tearing me to pieces. And as I come out of the vision, with my hands up, looking, I went screaming, \"O God, have mercy! It's killing me!\"\n\nL-150 I heard a Voice way down in the room, say, \"Remember, it's only six inches long.\"\n\nL-151 How many's heard that story? I've told you that many times, the people around the tabernacle.\n\nL-152 Well, on and on it went, suffering just the same.\n\nL-153 Mayo Brothers, the next day, examined me. Said, \"Your father was an Irishman, he drank. Your mother being a half Indian, that makes you almost a half-breed. So you'll be... you're--you're--you're just such a nervous wreck until you'll never be out of it.\" Said, \"Otherwise, you're healthy. But that, that's something in the soul that man cannot control.\" Said, \"You will...\" Said, \"When a man dies, can't hold a autopsy, 'cause his soul's gone.\" He said, \"Well, you'll never get over it.\"\n\nL-154 And that guy said, my old doctor, said, \"My father had it, he died at about eighty-five, ninety years old,\" somewhere along there, he said. And said, \"A month or two before he died, I examined him; had it all of his life, he'd get them\" said, \"spells.\"\n\nL-155 \"Some people,\" said, \"they get it, they're high tempered\"; said, \"that's the kind that'll kill you.\" He said, \"The other kind, like women in menopause, they cry. You got the kind that's kind of a weary feeling.\" Said, \"The old-timers used to call it 'had the blues,' it wouldn't leave them.\" Said, \"When that hits you, your stomach sours; you're just upset.\"\n\nL-156 I said, \"But, sir, I don't do nothing.\" I said, \"I'm happy.\"\n\nL-157 Said, \"That's right. That's just out of the human grab bag.\" Said, \"You'll always have it.\" Oh, what a discouraging thing!\n\nL-158 But the words, to think it, \"Remember, it's only six inches long,\" that's hung with me, as my dear wife back there can tell you. Year after year, I've thought of that.\n\nL-159 And then, going overseas this last time, I was... before. Well, I was back home, and I was on a squirrel-hunting trip. I jumped out of the car with Brother Banks Wood, who's listening in tonight, and I started to run up the hill, and looked like my heart would jump out of me.\n\nL-160 And I asked Dr. Sam Adair, I said, \"What does that?\"\n\nL-161 He said, \"Next time you have it, get a cardiogram.\"\n\nL-162 Said, \"All right.\"\n\nL-163 So it happened again in the--the next year, and went and took the cardiogram. He said, \"Nothing wrong with your heart,\" said, \"you're just nervous.\" Started coming on then.\n\nL-164 Well, another doctor said to me, a good friend of mine, said, \"That's your heart, boy,\" said \"you better be careful.\" That's the year I called Brother Moore and he got somebody to preach in my stead, when I went on that ram hunt with Brother Fred. I'd go up over mountains just like I did when I was sixteen years old, mile after mile, running; never bothered me a bit. See?\n\nL-165 And I come back and told Sam. He said, \"Well, there's something wrong, you better be careful.\"\n\nL-166 Then I saw a vision of an old doctor standing with those... old-fashioned doctor with stethoscopes over his arm. He said... He was standing in front of me one day, he said, \"Don't let them tell you 'that's your heart,' that's your stomach.\"\n\nL-167 So, I--I thought, \"Well, I'll just take that word, 'cause it was a vision. Come on.\"\n\nL-168 I started to Africa; and get some shots, and I had to take a bunch of shots before going to Africa, that's the law. So, 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min when I was getting these shots, he said, \"Why, I can't find one thing wrong with you.\" Said, \"Your hemoglobin, your blood's ninety-six, it's ninety-six.\" Said, \"If you was sixteen years old, it wouldn't be any--it wouldn't be any better.\" And said, \"Hard enough to beat you a hundred years. Lungs, everything,\" said, \"you're all right; no sugar, nothing.\"\n\nL-169 I said, \"Thank you.\" So I got a physical test, and--and to take my--my health certificate to the board.\n\nL-170 So, he said, \"You know anything about it?\"\n\nL-171 I said, \"Nothing but persistent souring in the stomach all the time.\"\n\nL-172 He said, \"Well, I'll tell you.\" He said...\n\nL-173 I said, \"Oh, I've been examined. I've been to Mayo Brothers, and everywhere.\"\n\nL-174 He said, \"But wait a minute.\" He said, \"Sometimes a ulcer is so little till that barium meal won't show it; and sometimes it's too big to show it, because an x-ray is only a shadow. And a little bitty ulcer, you can't see it, it won't enough stick. Whole lot of little bitty ulcers could do that.\" He said, \"I know an old doctor up here that's found an instrument, they got it now; they can put you to sleep with a little sodium pentothal, put a tube in your throat, and they just actually look down in your stomach and see what's wrong.\" Said, \"He...\" Said, \"He's your type of people, he's a Christian.\" Said, \"Why don't you go see him.\"\n\nL-175 I took his name: Dr. Van Ravensworth. So, when I come back, I went up to see the old doctor. Oh, he's a fine old man from Dutch East Indies, out of a big line of missionaries. And he had heard of me and read my book, and oh, he just shook my hand, he said, \"Brother Branham, I'd be glad to do that for you.\" He said, \"Tell you what to do; next week you run over at the hospital over here,\" and said, \"and call me up before you go.\" And said, \"I have to give you a little shot of pentothal.\" And said, \"Then when I do,\" said, \"it puts you to sleep for five minutes.\"\n\nL-176 My little girl had just took it to have a tooth pulled, and Brother Norman's little girl. \"A five minute sleep,\" I thought, \"that won't bother me.\" So, I thought I'd be satisfied then, to look at it.\n\nL-177 And then the next morning, I raised up in the bed and looked around, I looked over in the twin bed; my wife over there, she hadn't woke up yet. And I was looking out the window towards the great Catalina Mountains there where I live, and I looked up there where the Angel of the Lord put that Sword in my hand, where the seven Angels that you see in the picture appeared, great things taken place.\n\nL-178 And I looked, and as I looked, there I was standing by that tree again, right where that squirrel was. I looked up there, I thought, \"That's that squirrel's den.\" And I thought, \"Wonder if he's still up there?\" in the vision. I raked the side of the tree, out he come. And before I could even bat my eye... He was the oddest looking squirrel I ever seen; now, you'll have to know my ministry to know these symbols and things. He jumped at me but he missed me; he missed my mouth, hit on my chest and fell off.\n\nL-179 And as soon as he did, I heard Something said, \"Go to the Catalina Mountains.\"\n\nL-180 So I turned around, I said, \"Meda, are you awake, Honey?\" And I woke her up.\n\nL-181 She said, \"What's the matter?\" About five o'clock in the morning.\n\nL-182 I said, \"I was looking out here, and I saw that squirrel again, Honey.\"\n\nL-183 \"What squirrel?\"\n\nL-184 I said, \"The one I seen up there at Mayo's.\" I said, \"You know what? He missed my mouth this time, he never hit me, he went out on my chest.\" I said, \"Praise be to God! I've looked, oh, since a little boy, I have longed to see that happen. If I could ever see that happen, not even... Before I knowed what a vision was, if I could ever see that happen, then I said, 'I'd be all right. Whatever that told me, that's what I'd be.' And for forty years I've looked for that, and there it happened.\"\n\nL-185 Before, when I was at Mayo's, the same time I was up there when they give me that message, and I saw the vision...\n\nL-186 My ol' mother's gone on to Glory now, very odd woman. She had about three or four dreams in her life, and they 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min were always true. She'd tell me, and the... She'd start to tell me, I'd tell... I'd say, \"Stop right... Mama, I'll tell you what the rest of it is.\" See?\n\nL-187 Cause always when you give me a dream to interpret, you don't always tell me just exactly what it is. Then when I see it over again, I see exactly what you dreamed about, then He tells me what it is. See? You don't have to tell me what the dream is, He shows me the dream Himself. See? And then I see, I say, \"Well, you didn't tell me this and tell me that.\" See? And so the God that can interpret a dream, can show a dream; He can show one, He can interpret it. And so then... [Daniel 2:26-29]\n\nL-188 Well, wasn't there something like that in the Bible, said, \"If you can...\"? I--I... Just happened to come to me. Daniel, wasn't it? No, Joseph--Joseph. Well, it's somewhere in the Bible. I just remembered that, said, \"If you can show me... If you can tell me what a...\" Oh, it's King Nebuchadnezzar, that's right. Said, \"If you can... If you can't...\"\n\nL-189 The magicians said, \"Tell me the dream.\"\n\nL-190 He said, \"It's gone from me.\" That's right, that, I remember that; just thought of it then.\n\nL-191 Now notice. And Mama, she said, \"Billy,\" when I come back, she said, \"come here, son, and set down.\" She said, \"I had a strange dream. I dreamed that I seen you a-laying sick, just about to die, with your stomach as usual.\" How many diets has she cooked me! And she said, \"You were building a house upon a hill.\" And said, \"I seen six white doves come down from heaven, cooing, in a letter 'S' and they set upon your chest. And you was looking, and the one in front was trying to tell you something.\" Said, \"They was real glossy, white, doves. And they took their little heads and put against your cheek, and going, 'coo, coo, coo.'\" And said, \"I couldn't understand it.\" Said, \"They just kept going, 'coo, coo, coo.'\"\n\nL-192 I said, \"Oh, I see it, praise the Lord!\" And said, \"They formed their letter 'S' again and went back up into the skies, going 'coo, coo, coo, coo,' going back home.\"\n\nL-193 Well, the little animal that I saw was six inches long. The string of doves that Mom saw was six, six is incomplete. I knew that someday I'd see that seventh one. That was man, suffering; so on and on it went.\n\nL-194 That morning, I got up after seeing this vision; I obeyed the Lord. I took my little boy, Joseph, to school. He's listening to me now, in Tucson. I took him to school, and told Meda I didn't know when I'd be back.\n\nL-195 And I took off up into Catalina, up into the--the foothills, and--and went up into the place where the Angel of the Lord put the Sword in my hand. Real early; and started climbing up the mountain.\n\nL-196 Well, instead of going up in the peaks this a-way (which there's a lot snakes, scorpions, you know how Arizona is), I turned to my right; Something said, \"Turn to your right.\" I went way into the peaks; I went around, and I was going around those great huge rocks, many times bigger than this tabernacle, laying up in them tops there where seldom ever a person could get.\n\nL-197 And along about eleven o'clock, I was going into a little cove, back where some... a little place turned in like this over a little deer trail. And I had my shirt off, my hat in my hand, because I was just lathering with sweat. And so I turned in there, and as I turned into that little cove, I felt the presence of the Lord. I jerked off my hat and looked around. I thought, \"He's here somewhere. I know He's here.\" I thought, \"What is it?\" I made a few more steps. I said, \"Lord, You're here somewhere.\"\n\nL-198 And I looked laying on the path, and there laid that little squirrel; had jumped at something and missed it, and it hit a bunch of cholla (that's jumping cactus). It rammed through his head, chest, stomach, and he was dead. That odd-looking little squirrel, he had missed my mouth and hit that cholla. And the Voice of the Lord said, \"Your enemy is dead.\" I stood there, and I trembled. I took my foot and ma-...\n\nL-199 Usually crows would've eat it up. I killed a snake, couple days later than that, it laid on the road about a half hour. There's always eagles and crows flying through there, and they'll pick it up right now. I killed a coral snake, that's the most dangerous snake we got; laying right beside of me, a few days after that. I started to come back to pick it up to show it, the crows had done got it, the ravens passing over. 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min\n\nL-200 And that had been laying there ever since I had seen the vision, two days before; I believe it was on Saturday, and I went up there on Monday. So there he was, laying on there dead. I mashed through it with my foot.\n\nL-201 I went back around, set down again; set there and cried a while, and prayed; looking down over Tucson, miles below me.\n\nL-202 Turned back around and come back, it still laid there. When I entered that cove the Spirit of God come on me again.\n\nL-203 I went on around, went down the mountain. Went in and told my wife, I said, \"Honey, I don't know how, but I'm going to get over this.\"\n\nL-204 Dr. Ravensworth, when he give me the examination, he said, \"It's totally impossible for you to be well.\" He give me a shot of pentothal that was to last me for five minutes, and I slept ten hours. So that stuff, even an aspirin just knocks me out. So they... He give me a shot, put that tube down my throat. When I come to, and he told me the next morning, he said, \"Reverend, I hate to tell you this, but\" said \"your stomach walls are even so hard, they're dried up.\" I never seen it; he used the name of gastritis, and I went and looked in the dictionary and it said, \"something that's withered away.\" And said, \"You can't get over it.\" He said, \"You'll always have it.\" And I would've been a discouraged boy if it hadn't been for the vision of the Lord.\n\nL-205 And the next day Something said, \"Go back to the mountain.\"\n\nL-206 And that day instead of going one way, I was led to go another way. And I was standing there; and looking, setting in the front of me, and there set that seventh little, white dove, looking right at me. I rubbed my eyes, I said, \"Surely, it's a vision; surely, it is.\" I looked, and I said, \"Little dove, where do you come from?\" Just as pretty and white, could've been a pigeon; whatever it was, away in that wilderness.\n\nL-207 God Almighty, Who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, Whose servant I am, and His Word laying here, open before me, know that I tell the truth and lie not. [Acts 5:30], [Romans 8:11]\n\nL-208 There set the dove, setting there looking at me. I walked around, I thought, \"Surely, it's a vision.\" I turned my head, I looked back, and there he set there; them little, white wings, just as snowy as he could be; his little, yellow feet; and little, yellow beak; setting there looking at me. He was watching right straight westward. I walked around him like that, I wouldn't touch him for nothing. I walked on up the trail; looked back, and there he still set watching me.\n\nL-209 Brother, as a son of Abraham, I consider not what the doctor told me, I'm going to be well, anyhow!\n\nL-210 The third day I went back, I was climbing up high. And many of you know the vision about the Indian chief riding that little wall to the west. Something attracted me off to a big rock, about noon time, said, \"Lay your hands against that and pray.\" God in Heaven knows this is true.\n\nL-211 I laid my hands against the rock and looked up towards Heaven and started praying, and I heard a Voice coming out of the top of the rocks there, said, \"What are you leaning against, over your heart?\" And I raised back like this, my bare shoulders; naked from my waist up, hot. I looked back. And there was wrote in the quartz, in the stone, \"White Eagle\"; just exactly what the vision said that the next Message would come forth by.\n\nL-212 I was so excited, I run home; got a camera and come back the next day, and took the picture of it. It was still there, wrote in the rock: \"White Eagle.\" (Dove leading eagle.)\n\nL-213 Somehow, I--I know. I'll tell you before it happens. The doctor's a good doc-... good doctor, no doubt; I--I think he's a fine man. But I--I know I'm going to be over it. It's done! It's finished, and I'm going to be well!\n\nL-214 And I was thinking as Ernie sang that song a few moments ago, On The Wings Of A Dove. How is the melody to that? Start it for me, Ernie. ... wings... snow-white dove, (sing it with me) God sent down His pure, sweet love, Was a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min\n\nL-215 I understand Ernie made two verses of that. I'm going to make you three verses. Noah had drifted On the floods many days, He searched for land, In various ways; Troubles he had some, But not from above, For God gave him His sign On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Was a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Jesus, our Saviour Came to earth one day; He was borned in a stable, In a manger of hay; Though here rejected, But not from above, For God gave us His sign On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Oh, a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Though I have suffered In many a way, I cried for healing Both night and day; But faith wasn't forgotten By the Father above, He gave me His sign On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Oh, a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove.\n\nL-216 Dear God, I thank You for these things, Father. You give Noah the sign, You gave the world the sign, and You gave me a sign. And the next day, seeing that eagle flying, O God, there's a Message coming forth now, and I pray, God, that You'll let the Dove lead. Grant it, Lord. It's led me to a faith I never had before. I know, God, I know it's going to be all right; so I thank You for it, Father.\n\nL-217 And, tonight, send down Your Message again, Lord, on the wings of the Dove of the Word. Grant it, dear Heavenly Father. And every one that passes through this platform, tonight, and out yonder in the meetings across the 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min country, may Your great Dove of faith fall into their hearts and give them faith, Lord, for their healing. Remember that God is not a respect of person. He could a-send the Message to Noah, could send It to John the Baptist, could send It to me, can send It to others. [Genesis 8:11], [John 1:32]\n\nL-218 I pray that that Dove will fly into every heart right now, Lord, with Its little, golden beak, and whisper that, \"By His stripes... By My wounds and stripes you are healed.\" God, grant that our transgressions will be blotted out, our iniquities will be forgiven us, and that our sickness will be healed. It's in Your hands, Father. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. [John 1:32], [Isaiah 53:5], [I Peter 2:24], [Isaiah 43:25], [Isaiah 44:22] With your heads bowed just one minute longer.\n\nL-219 How many here would like to say, if you can and want to say this, \"Brother Branham, I've been wrong all my life. I've wanted to serve God, but tonight I'm ready to surrender. Pray God, that that Dove will fly into my heart tonight. I can feel It flutter His wings as He comes in\"? Raise your hands, will you? Here in the visible audience, my, all over the building. [John 1:32]\n\nL-220 Way out into the audiences across the country, way up to Brother Hunt and Brother Coleman, out to Brother Leo and them, down into Tucson, over in the Branham Tabernacle, across the West Coast, raise your hands everywhere: \"I want the Dove to fly into my heart tonight. Bring me God's sweet love on the wings of a snow-white Dove, the Holy Spirit. Bring It to me, tonight, Lord, and drop into my heart the faith that I have need of.\" [Matthew 3:16], [Mark 1:10], [Luke 3:22], [John 1:32]\n\nL-221 In the Name of Jesus Christ, I pray, God, forgive our sins. The wounded Dove has brought the Message back, O God, \"It's finished!\" We believe that. Just give us faith to believe It, we pray. In Jesus' Name. Amen. [John 19:30] On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Was a sign from above, On the wings of a dove.\n\nL-222 Where'd that dove come from? I don't know. He wouldn't have been out there in that wilderness like that. No, no! No, he wouldn't have been there. And why was he white? The Heavenly Father knows he was as white as my shirt. There he set there. But it was on the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Oh, a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Oh, a sign from above, On the wings of a dove.\n\nL-223 Oh, don't you feel real humble? Let's just shake one anothers' hands, and sing it. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove.\n\nL-224 Let's raise our hands to Him, and sing it. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Noah had drifted 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min On the floods many day, He searched for land, In various way; Trouble he had some, But not from above, God sent down His sign On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Oh, a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Jesus, our Saviour Came to earth one day; Borned in a stable, In a manger of hay; Though here rejected, But not from above, God gave us His sign On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends down His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove.\n\nL-225 Why, me an old man, suffered all my life, why did He heal me now? I believe I'll ride this trail again, I got to bring a Message! And I say to my Father, tonight, (as Junior seen in a--a dream the other night of the wings of this Dove, moving in these windows here), Lord, Your servant's reporting for service. Amen, I'm ready! On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends me His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove.\n\nL-226 Let's believe now that He's moving in upon the audience. On the wings of a snow-white... (We're waiting, Lord.) God sends down His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove.\n\nL-227 You that got prayer cards, in this aisle here, step forward over here; stand up, step forward in this aisle here, over this a-way. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove.\n\nL-228 Those with prayer cards in this line, step out to your left. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends His pure sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min\n\nL-229 Those... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Oh, on the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent me His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove.\n\nL-230 Where did the dove come from up there in the wilderness? I'd say this: God seen Abraham needed a ram for a sign, He's Jehovah-jireh, \"the Lord can provide for Himself the sacrifice.\" To think of it! The same God, by the same inspiration, by the same kind of people, sent a dove. He's still God, Jehovah-jireh can provide anything He has need of. [Genesis 22:13-14]\n\nL-231 Won't you, just while you're coming through this prayer line now, ask God to provide for you on the wings of the Dove? The Dove, Spirit of the Holy Ghost, to give you faith in your heart to believe that you're going to be healed.\n\nL-232 I'm trying to get them all on their feet, you see. I'm asking now. Brother Brown's at his place. Brother Jack... What say? [Someone speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] All right, good. This section here, comes through this a-way first, that's lined up. The sections back over in here fall right in behind them. These fall right in behind the wing. And you fall right in behind these here, coming right around to be prayed for.\n\nL-233 Now, I'm sure this is not going to be no fast line, we're just going to take a little time so we can really pray for each one, far as we can.\n\nL-234 Now, I cut my message just a little short (and you all caught that, see) so that I could have this prayer line. This is a memorial line in honor of the days when Brother Jack Moore, Brother Young Brown, your wives let you go, and you come over and we went out into California, and all through Arizona (together, through the desert), and prayed for the sick.\n\nL-235 You know what? There's people living today that was dying then, and still alive because of that effort. What did it do? It sprung up Divine healings in every church there is in the country, now even Presbyterians and so forth. They... It hushed their mouth, for it taken God to anoint somebody to slay the Goliath, to show that it could be done, then the rest of them took courage (that's right) and went on. It can be done again, for He still sends His love on the wings of a Dove. [I Samuel 17:32, 50-52]\n\nL-236 Christians, I want you to listen. If I would stand here and try to quote to you of the supernatural things that I've seen happen even in the past three years, I'd be here this time next Saturday night, telling you. I don't even speak of it so much, 'cause it sounds like it's almost impossible, but I tell you the Truth. It's exactly the Truth. We're living under the leadership of the Great Mighty Jehovah, the same One that was with the prophet in the Old Testament, with the Church in the New Testament, He's here today taking a Bride out of the Gentiles for His Name's sake. Believe It! Won't you, people? If you ever did believe It, believe It right now. That's who... I want you to do it. We don't know what'll happen yet tonight. We don't know what will happen. We're just waiting under expectation. [Acts 15:14]\n\nL-237 Please, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, I ask you as His servant. I know when you're dealing with congregations, you got everything mixed in there. But if you believe me as His servant, if there's one speck of doubt (or sin is--is \"doubt, unbelief\"), if there's one speck of it in your heart, ask Father to take it away right now. See? \"Lord...\" And then when you come with genuine faith... Now, my hands won't mean nothing unless That strikes you first; then when it comes, it'll light it off, you'll be healed. That's right, you'll know you'll be healed. See, you'll believe it.\n\nL-238 Now, I'm going to pray now for each one of you. And now... When you do this, you put your hands over on one another too, so we're... And you be praying for the person you got your hands on, then I'm going to bring you through the line. Put your hands on somebody that's with you in the line.\n\nL-239 Dear God, I--I don't know no other way of saying these things, Lord. I just know to tell what I know is the Truth, and You're my witness tonight that I am telling the Truth. My faith, Lord, and my own healing in the future; I don't know when, I don't know how, I don't understand it; but I believe It, Lord, that I received the sign from above. That seventh dove finally got here, the seventh inch is soon finished on the animal. It's over! 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min\n\nL-240 God, I want to serve Your people. So I pray, God, that You'll so anoint us tonight that whoever we lay our hands on, may they be healed; not because it's us, but because it's following Your commandment. You said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\" Lord, help me to believe, and help their hearts to be the bedding ground of faith. And may, together, for the glory of God, every sick and afflicted person in this building (or the buildings throughout the land) that's obeying these commands now, will be made well. In the Name of Jesus Christ, I ask it. Amen. [Mark 16:17-18]\n\nL-241 Have faith; all of you pray with us. Now, this is not a line of discernment. [Matthew 17:20], [Matthew 21:21-22], [Mark 11:22-24]\n\nL-242 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Depression, fear, I know what this... Poor little thing, she said she's never seen peace in life. The same thing that I... Can't sleep, nervous, tension.\n\nL-243 Dear God, bear me record, Lord, that I've told the Truth. How I feel for this little woman! I pray, God, that You'll send to her, tonight, that streak of faith from above that knows that You are obligated to Your Word, and You'll keep every Word. May the God of Heaven take this fear away from my sister. And I obey You by laying my hands upon her and condemning it. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may it come out of her. Amen.\n\nL-244 Now, look sister, you believe me now, if you can start from right here, by the cross. From this night, deny you got it. See, go on saying, \"I haven't got it no more.\" Then it will leave you.\n\nL-245 Sister Palmer, our sister, Sister Palmer; her husband is a very dear friend of mine, a minister from Georgia or Alabama, Georgia--Georgia. And she was coming up to the tabernacle... They drive, when I'm preaching up at tabernacle, fifteen hundred miles to hear one service. Brother Palmer lost control of his car, or the boy, one, when they was turning a corner, and they had a wreck. She's got an affect of it. Let's pray:\n\nL-246 Dear God, deliver this servant of Yours, his little wife, loyal, true, little servant in Christ, I pray, God, as I lay my hands upon her with my Brother Jack Moore here, that You'll heal her and make her well. In Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-247 In the right foot, and you're standing for him? His little boy is crippled, he's got a hurting in his stomach and back. Let's pray:\n\nL-248 Dear God, let that snow-white Dove dip down into his heart just now, \"Wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquity, with His stripes we are healed.\" I ask this to be so for our brother and for his little son, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. [Isaiah 53:5]\n\nL-249 Severe headache pains, and a leg ailment that bothers him while he's a-working.\n\nL-250 Dear God, grant Your healing blessing upon this young man, as we as servants of God lay our hands upon him. In the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nL-251 She has a lady's trouble, female, and also she wants the Baptism of the Holy Ghost.\n\nL-252 Dear God, as I offer you this prayer of faith for this little lady, may the female trouble be gone, may the Baptism of the Holy Ghost come on the wings of a Dove, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. (God bless you, sister.)\n\nL-253 Growth on his eye, and for his loving companion.\n\nL-254 Dear God, You know the hearts of man. I pray Thee Father, in Jesus' Name, that You'll grant this request that this brother's asked; and our obedience to Your Word of laying hands on him. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. (God bless you, brother.)\n\nL-255 She has a growth in her left side, and also her voice is bad.\n\nL-256 Dear Jesus, I pray that You'll heal this sister; laying hands upon her in the Name of Jesus Christ, that her healing will be. Amen. (God bless you, my sister.)\n\nL-257 Poor sister, I see your trouble, swollen limb. Kidney, bladder, and a ankle throwed out of place.\n\nL-258 O Father, God, heal this precious woman, Lord, I pray, as I lay hands upon her in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min\n\nL-259 God bless you, sister; that's the way, it'll be done.\n\nL-260 You hear that, don't you, on the microphone? Ever who's at... the engineer, if you'll step it up just a little bit, the audience can hear their testi-... or what they say when they come by. Be in prayer for them when you hear it; when I start praying, you pray with me.\n\nL-261 Dear God, I pray for this our sister, that You'll heal her, dear God. We're doing this because it's Your command. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-262 Dear God, You hear that testimony, You hear what the enemy's done to her. We are trying to take the Name of Jesus and defeat this enemy; he is already because the bruised, striped Dove fell in the floor of the House of God with a Message, \"It's over!\" Grant it, may she believe that, Father, in Jesus' Name.\n\nL-263 Dear God, I pray that You'll heal this our sister. May the Dove of God witness to her tonight that He did it for her, that she could be well. In Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-264 Dear God, I lay my hands upon my brother who stands here. He had enough faith to come this far, Lord, now may he receive his healing and go to his seat well. In Jesus' Name.\n\nL-265 Dear God, I pray for our brother, laying hands upon him. Help, dear God, that the faith of God will dip down just at this time; and be like Abraham, call those things which are, as though they're--are not, for God made the promise. In Jesus' Name. Amen. [Romans 4:17]\n\nL-266 Dear God, You are the One who can make the true decision. I pray, dear God, as this young lady asked for this, may she receive it in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-267 Dear God, I lay my hands upon our sister in obeying what You said do. This takes us back for many years, Lord, since we run a prayer line like this; but we know what happened then, we know You're the same God today if people can have the same faith today. I pray in Jesus' Name for our sister's healing. Amen.\n\nL-268 Dear God, I lay my hands upon my brother here and ask for his healing, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nL-269 Father, I bring before you tonight this our sister, and lay my hands upon her to witness that I'm standing as a witness of Your strength, stand as a witness of Your visions, Your Word, and I'm a witness that You are God. And I lay hands upon her in obedience to the Word of my God, and ask for her healing. Amen.\n\nL-270 Dear God, I lay hands upon my brother in like manner, as a witness of Your strength I ask for his healing in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-271 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] \"What?\" She said, \"The Healer.\" Said that \"A man from up somewhere, up in Arkansas, had been healed that morning, a blind shoe cobbler.\" You know the story. It'd been on the radio. And I said... I thought... I played the part of a hypocrite. I said, \"You don't believe that's the Truth?\" She said, \"Yes, sir, I do.\" And I said, \"Do you believe in this day when God would do something like that, when...\"\n\nL-272 She said, \"Sir, I listened to the religious program.\" She said, \"I'm a Christian.\" She said, \"I listened to the programs, I heard that man up there that was healed this morning, that blind shoe cobbler. They throwed him out of the church, he was making so much noise, one church to the other. With his hat on a cane, wiggling it around, running up-and-down the churches, everyone in the city, hollering, 'I'm healed! I'm healed!' A blind shoe cobbler.\" I said, \"Do you believe that?\"\n\nL-273 And she stood there a little bit, was kind of drizzling rain, she said, \"Sir, if you'll get me in where he's at, then I'll find my Father.\" Then I felt about like that. I said, \"Maybe I'm the one you're looking for.\" She said... grabbed me by the lapels of the coat, she said, \"Is you the Healer?\" I said, \"No, sister, but I'm Brother Branham.\" She said, \"Have mercy!\" 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min I thought of poor old blind Fanny Crosby, \"While on others Thou art calling, do not pass me by.\" See, He had healed one, He could heal her.\n\nL-274 I put my hands over her eyes, I said, \"Dear Jesus, one day an old rugged cross come bumping down the street, the shoulders with blood running out of them, the little frail body that was packing it fell under the load. A colored man by the name of Simon, of Cyrene, came up and picked up the cross, helped Him bear it. I'm sure You remember it, Father. And one of his children is staggering here in darkness, I'm sure You understand.\" [Matthew 27:32] She said, \"Glory to God! I can see!\" Uh-huh. I said, \"Can you see?\" She said, \"Yes, sir.\" I said, \"Count them lights.\" And she counted them. I said, \"What color suit I got on?\" Said, \"You got on a gray suit, with a yellow tie.\" That was it, she could see.\n\nL-275 Oh, God respects humility. Uh-huh. This in itself is that which will make, and bring to pass, the tremendous victory in the Love Divine.\n\nL-276 Dear God, have mercy and heal my sister, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nL-277 Dear God, as I take this feeble, wrinkling hand, only You know what's passed through here. I pray, dear God, that the same hand I got tonight will embrace like those feeble hands of Simeon that day, \"Lord, let Thy servant depart in peace, for I now see Thy salvation.\" May It come upon her, Lord, Your salvation, and make her well in Jesus' Name. Amen. [Luke 2:28-30]\n\nL-278 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] On The Trial, Mr. Unbelief indicted Jesus Christ. You remember The Trial? How that the... They had the--the attorney and everything, and who stood for who. And we had the--the prosecuting attorney, Satan, that was going to prosecute; how the, trial was brought.\n\nL-279 And he said, one, Mr. Doubter, he come up, he said, \"I heard a preacher say, 'Anoint the sick in oil, the Bible says that.' I was anointed in oil, wasn't healed. The other one said, 'Lay hands on the sick, they shall recover.'\" He was trying to prosecute. [Mark 16:18]\n\nL-280 But when the witness came forth, here it was, \"God told them, said, 'You'd been... '\" He said, \"It's been six months since I had hands laid on me, and Your Word says that 'Lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.' And hands was laid on me by one of Your anointed servants, and I haven't recovered yet. Therefore, You're a false pretender, because Your Word don't mean what It says.\" [Mark 16:18]\n\nL-281 So when the witness come up, the true was this, that \"His Word is true. He never said when He would do it, He said, 'These signs shall follow them that believe; if they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.' See? See, that's what He said, 'They shall recover.' So whether it's a prong miracle just happen right like this or whether it's just obeying God, that's up to Him in the individual. See? But if the individual believes It, I don't care how long it takes. He said to Abraham, 'You're going to have a baby by Sarah.' The baby never come for twenty-five years. He told Noah it was 'going to rain.' Noah had the flood... the--the ark built for the flood, many, many years before the flood came, but he knew it was going to rain. The Bible said, 'The prayer of faith shall save the sick, and God shall raise them up.' When? He didn't say. God is just, He's true, just read what His Word says.\" [Mark 16:17-18], [Genesis 17:19], [Genesis 6:13, 17], [James 5:15]\n\nL-282 That's what I've done tonight, laid hands on the sick. Now, I believe every one of them's going to be healed. I believe, every one of them. Do you believe the same? Now believe for these afflicted people.\n\nL-283 There's a little lady here, seems like I ought to know, I prayed for her last night, out there in the prayer line. What's her name? Chambers... Chambless. If that little lady would have lived--would have lived normally, wouldn't a-been afflicted, she certainly been a beautiful woman. And she's setting there now, shaking. Lovely, fine spirit in the girl. And she sets there jerking like this. Oh, how that breaks my heart. How that I've wished... just how I would!\n\nL-284 Here's a little baby, lady setting here holding it. Its little tongue hanging out, its little body afflicted. What if that was my little Joseph? What if it was my little grandson Paul? What if that was Rebekah setting back there, or Sarah? 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min What if Mrs. Simpson here was my wife Meda? This young man setting here was Billy Paul? This aged woman setting here was my mother? Remember, it's somebody's baby, somebody's sister, somebody's daughter, and somebody's son. See? I am their brother, He is our Saviour. All that I can do is... what faith I've got is offered in their behalf. That's all I know.\n\nL-285 Now, the Lord can show me a vision, He could tell me what's the matter with each one of them. I can prove that to you, see, you know that. But that don't heal them. That doesn't heal them. No, it's got to be something drop in them, see. And I hope... [Numbers 12:6]\n\nL-286 Like I could go up here take each one of you and baptize you in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that won't remit your sins. No, no! No, I don't believe in water baptism in the Name of Jesus Christ unto regeneration; I believe the Blood is regeneration, see, not--not the waters. But, see, I could baptize and baptize, but you only go down a dry sinner, come up a wet one; see, until you have thoroughly repented. Repent, and then be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ. See? And that's what I different with the Oneness movement. Not baptizing to regeneration, no; I believe it's the Blood that cleanses, not the water. See? Repentance, and then be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-287 Now I'm going down to pray. And these people are just as much to you as they are to me, maybe even more in that line of relation.\n\nL-288 Now let's all join together, and your hands in faith, and my hand in faith, bringing down the hands of the Lord Jesus to lay on these poor crippled people. Will you pray with me?\n\nL-289 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Those with handkerchiefs that's for the sick and the afflicted, you may get them right after service. Now help me pray for these, will you?\n\nL-290 God, we thank You, Lord, for what You have done tonight. We thank You in advance for the healing of every person come through the line. Dear God, I pray over these handkerchiefs, perhaps for some who could not even come to the meeting, and their loved ones brought the handkerchiefs. In the Bible we're taught that they took from the body of Paul, handkerchiefs or aprons. Now, those people back there had lived in Your presence, they had seen You on the street, they had seen You in their meeting, and they had seen Your same Spirit upon Paul. And they knew it wasn't that man, it was Your Spirit that was dominating his life, for we see Paul doing the same things that You did. [Acts 19:11, 12]\n\nL-291 And now, Lord, the people of this day sees the same God living in His Church with His people. And they've brought these handkerchiefs, that they might be taken from here to their loved ones. Grant it, God, that every one of them will be healed in Your own way. We don't request any certain thing to be done of any certain way or any certain nature; we just ask, \"In Your own way, Father, heal them.\" For the glory of God, I offer this prayer of faith over it. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-292 I've had a wonderful time of fellowship around your faith, your presence in Jesus Christ. This will be a meeting that I'll long remember of what taken place: love, cooperation, fellowship.\n\nL-293 And now, till we meet again, may God of Heaven guide you. He Who makes the stars to shine bright at night to lighten up the path when it's growing dim, may He lighten your path with the Star of Bethlehem to guide you to a full surrendered life in His Word, is my prayer. Till we meet, till we meet, Till we meet at Jesus' feet; Till we meet, till we meet, God be with you till we meet again.\n\nL-294 Now let us stand. My Faith Looks Up to Thee!...?... I... well, I'll change that. I believe that's fine. My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary, Saviour Divine! Now hear me while I pray, Take all my sin away, 65-1128E, On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 127 min O let me from this day Be wholly Thine!\n\nL-295 Now let's shake one anothers' hands when they sing. While life's dark maze I tread, And griefs around me spread, Be Thou my Guide; Bid darkness turn to day, Wipe sorrow's tears away, Nor let me ever stray From Thee aside.\n\nL-296 Feel better now, don't you? On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Now on the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove.\n\nL-297 That's our closing message for this campaign. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove.\n\nL-298 Bow our head. As the wheels hum a song going home, I trust it'll... you'd hear the humming of the wheels, the roaring of the engine.

Happy to be here this morning. And we're glad, enjoying this great fellowship around these old songs of faith. We love that. Don't you? The Amen chorus. That's what He is, the Amen, see. He's got the last word to say.\n\nL-2 I was setting over there talking to my old friend, Brother Brown, while the songs was going on. And he said, \"Brother Branham, I never seen till yesterday, what you've been talking about.\" He said, \"If people could just get into what you're speaking about,\" said, \"every obstacle would move out of the way.\" That's exactly right. That's right. It's exactly right. If you could just grasp It and catch It. See?\n\nL-3 Talking to my little friend, Ernie Fandler. I guess some of you out on the hookups will remember Ernie, how he was converted, how he was led to the Lord. He doesn't talk good English, or I'd like to have him come say a word. And he gets his we's and W's all mixed up. He was asking me if I remember the time at the Shawano where he lives. There was a man died right in the meeting, dropped over in his seat dead, Lutheran. And we had everybody keep quiet. Spoke the Word of the Lord over him, he come back to life. He come that other way. They had never got over that, wants us come back again.\n\nL-4 And I understood that in France, this morning, there's better than two thousand Frenchmen on a several-day fast that we'll come bring the Message to France in French. The whole Protestant nation, Protestant part of the nation of France. And so we are...\n\nL-5 It's just begin blooming now, just begin, the shuck's pulling away so the wheat can lay out there now. See? So just keep reverent, keep praying. See? Remember, \"They that wait upon the Lord, renew their strength.\" [Isaiah 40:31]\n\nL-6 Now, there's... I was... getting pretty old, and I thought, \"Will I... Will there be another revival, I'll see another time?\" And just remember, from the west will come a white horse rider. We'll ride this trail again. That's right. Soon as... we're about ready. It's a promise, you see.\n\nL-7 Now, I want to say to Brother Leo... I was talking about Brother Wood last night, his brother being here. Brother Leo, if you and the little group that's hooked in up there this morning; Sister Mercier, your father's here. I seen him last night. He's around here in the building somewhere, and he looks fine and dandy.\n\nL-8 The morning he was healed up at the tabernacle, there was two major cancer cases, real dying, and both of them was healed. And their father, an elderly man in a heart attack, was brought out to the glory of God. And he's in the meeting here somewhere. I can't see him amongst the crowd now, but he was here last night.\n\nL-9 Greetings to all of you out across the land; here in this wonderful place, of the Life Tabernacle here at Shreveport, with a whole jammed-out crowd for a Sunday school. You know, if I lived at Shreveport, not saying nothing against anybody, but this would be the place I'd come to church at, right here at the Life Tabernacle. This is not a denomination. The Life Tabernacle, is today, is a interdenominational tabernacle. They come out of the denomination because they accepted me and this Message I preach. Brother Jack Moore, my brother and friend, he was taken from the denominations because he associated with me. And so I think he deserves some credit. That's right. God bless him. And hold up his hands in prayer, and believe with him.\n\nL-10 And now Sister Moore, I don't see her anywhere, she... Yes, back here. She looked like a little girl setting over there this morning, all this dressed up, new, and just looked like a Easter outfit. And it--it looked like... Brother Jack didn't even know her hisself. Now, Sister Moore.\n\nL-11 We sure miss Anna Jeanne and Don, and all of them. Glad to meet Brother Nolan, he was one of the associates here.\n\nL-12 And Brother Ernie, I asked him yesterday if he'd sing that Amen. I've got it on a record, and I've wore the thing out just listening over it, Amen. I think he's got a voice for that; beats any of them. And little Judy, I noticed her; the two, 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min they look just like brother and sister. Don't they? They're husband and wife. Look at the each of them, see why they just look exactly. See? They're really a lovely little couple. That's, you know, that's... Brother Palmer that's just climbed the golden stairs, that's his daughter and son-in-law. And that's... She is certainly a contribution to his well training of a child. And got others too, married ministers also, and these are the evangelists and on their field, and others. So it's just great.\n\nL-13 I haven't seen Sister Palmer. Really, I don't know whether I'd know her if I seen her, or not. She's, perhaps, somewhere (of course) in the meeting. Back in the back; God bless you, Sister Palmer.\n\nL-14 My heart shakes every time I think of it. Brother Palmer had just climbed the steps till, a few minutes, until I got the message that he was gone I just couldn't believe it. Billy called me, and somebody had got a hold... and they knowed. We were such lovely friends, and to know that he was gone, it was really shaking. But we all got to go, regardless of who we are, we must go one by one. But there's only one thing, \"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the full duty of man,\" Ecclesiastes 12. [Ecclesiastes 12:13]\n\nL-15 Now, I haven't got too much time for this Sunday school lesson, and I'm hoarse.\n\nL-16 Say, Brother Pearry Green done a noble thing. He heard me say, last night, \"I missed my little piece of hair to keep me...\" He called out there and tried to get somebody fly it in for me. I said, \"You're too late, I'm already hoarse.\" I tried for years to find some accomplishment, but when I got that, it cured it. But I forgot it this time, so I'm a little bit hoarse. So you bear with me, if you will, in speaking.\n\nL-17 Now, how many likes Sunday school? Oh, my, that's right. It's a good thing to send your children to. No, let me correct that, a good thing to bring your children to. That's right, to bring your children; you come also. How many knows how our Sunday school was first originated? Where was it originated? England. What was it called first? Ragged school. That's right, called \"Ragged school.\" As I forget the man's name now that established it. What was, his name? [Someone says, \"Robert Raikes.\"--Ed.] That's right, exactly right. And he got the little fellows off the street (was ragged, and wouldn't have no place to go, and very bad), and he brought them in and started giving them lessons on the Bible. And it's growed to one of the greatest orders of the church, nearly, today, Sunday school. Good to go. Be sure to come, bring your children. I think the tabernacle here has teachers, equipped rooms, ages, and so forth. And you new converts that's just coming to Christ, follow right on along the Message; come here at the Life Tabernacle, and they'll do you good.\n\nL-18 Now, tonight we're going to have an old-fashioned prayer line. We're going to just pray for the sick the way we use to, Brother Jack and Brother Brown.\n\nL-19 I remember seeing Brother Brown try to give out those prayer cards, and how him being a minister himself... And in those days, in a organization that we... they put pressure on him, you know, \"I--I'm your brother,\" and those things, you know. \"You got to get me up there.\" Oh, he sure had a hard time, but stayed just as true as true could be. Brother Brown is one fine man. And so we love him.\n\nL-20 And as I see all of us, the three of us getting... creeping up towards the aged, the end. It'll be a very sad thing if we didn't have placed within us that great thing, what we know is Truth. We're just fixing to turn back one of these days, back to our young manhood again, to never... our bodies transformed, made into His likeness to stand. \"For when this earthly tabernacle of our habitation be desolved, there's one already waiting.\" [II Corinthians 5:1]\n\nL-21 And the thankful part of it, dear friend, that the dear Lord Jesus... You who trust me to tell you the Truth; the dear Lord Jesus, one morning about eight o'clock, let me see that Land. Now, it wasn't--it wasn't a vision; but I don't want to say that. Ever what it was, it was just as real as I'm speaking to you here. Now, I seen the faces of those people, and I couldn't recognize them, they had turned back young again. And they was just real as... I'd hold their hands and things. Just as real...\n\nL-22 And it helped me, because I used to have an idea: when a person died, just their soul went off. But then when He quoted that to me, that \"If this earthly tabernacle of our habitation be... we already have one.\" See? And we got to have everything in threes, to make a perfection. See? And there's one body here, then that body there which is the--the 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min celestial body, and then the glorified body in the resurrection. See, that makes it complete. See? So it's a... It's not a myth, it's not an idea, it's not a spirit. It is a man and a woman like you are, just exactly. [II Corinthians 5:1-4], [I Corinthians 15:40, 42-44]\n\nL-23 And then, years ago, I seen the regions of the lost, and was there. I tell you, friend, as an old man, let me persuade you this, across the nation this morning, don't never want to view that place. There's no way at all that I could... if I was an artist with a brush I couldn't paint the picture. As a minister, I couldn't describe to you. Talk about hell being a burning place, it's a million times worse than that, the horrors that goes with it.\n\nL-24 And Heaven... or this place, wherever it was, I don't know what to call it. He referred to it there as \"souls under the altar.\" But when it was, I have never... There's no way to explain how great that is. There is... Now, you just have to take my word, I'm just a man. See? But these visions that's always come to pass just as I have told you, and you know they every one has been true, that is true also. Whatever you do, if you miss everything else (health, strength, your eyesight, whatever it is), don't miss That. There's nothing can compare with it. It's... There's no--there's no word in the English language, that I know, that could express it. If you'd say \"perfect,\" it's beyond that; \"superb,\" it--it's beyond that; \"sublime,\"... There's no--there's no words that I know that could express it, because it was so... And then, to think, that isn't the end of it yet. I thought, \"Me be afraid to come to this?\" [Revelation 6:9]\n\nL-25 I said, \"Do you eat?\" Said, \"Not here. We don't eat here, but when we go back to earth we'll receive a body to eat in.\"\n\nL-26 Well, I could feel them. They was just like that. See? And they... I said, \"Well, you have...\" Oh, yes, they have a body. Just not a myth, it's a body. We know one another. They all knowed me, were hugging me, millions of them.\n\nL-27 And I said, \"Well, I want to see Him Who brought me here.\" It said, \"You can't see Him now, you have to wait.\" I said, \"Why did you put me on... up here?\" Said, \"You were a leader in life.\"\n\nL-28 And I said, \"Do You mean all them's Branhams?\"\n\nL-29 He said, \"No! That's your converts to Christ.\" See?\n\nL-30 I looked around, and then all the hard nights, the trials, passed away, when I could see their faces. A young woman went up there, one of the most beautiful women, and she just threw her arms around me, and said, \"Precious Brother.\" And when she passed by... Now, she was a woman. So... But in there, there'll never be sin. See, our glands are changed there. They won't raise children no more, there. See? See, all the same.\n\nL-31 What makes the difference, the sensation. That's the reason I don't believe in dancing on the floor. No man... I, before God and my Bible, I've lived clean, as that way through my life when I was a little boy, all through my young manhood. Any girl I ever went out with, I can walk right back to the Judgment with her. See? But there's no man, I don't care who you are, can let a woman (in the make of a woman) hug herself up close to you; if you're a true healthy man, there's a sensation. But it wasn't there; there's no glands. They're all the same gland. See? Just pure, unadulterated sisterly and brotherly love, more than it would be for your... even for your... hug your own little daughter. See? Your own daughter, yet she's made... she's female and you're a male. See, it could create something; but There it can't, sin is done, it's all over. See? Real... just real, holy Love.\n\nL-32 And I looked at that woman. There was... looked like millions of them there, and they all long hair, and white garments down. And--and this One that was talking to me, said, \"Don't you recognize her.\"\n\nL-33 I said, \"No.\" Said, \"She was in her ninety's when you led her to Christ.\"\n\nL-34 \"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.\" See? There's no way of ever explaining what it is. Just take my word if you believe me. Be sure to make... burn every bridge of the world behind you.\n\nL-35 I believe the church is beginning to hear the Message, and beginning to understand It. But friend, listen, we've got 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min to lay in the Presence of the Son, we've got to be ripened. Our--our faith isn't ripe. Intellectually we're hearing the Message that God has give us, and seeing the signs that He showed us, and proving it by the Bible, it's there, but, oh, how the church needs to lay in His Presence till it tenders up, you know, and gets sweet in the Spirit so that it can bathe down. Sometime in speaking the Message, you get harsh, have to break it in like that, because you've got to clinch a nail to make it hold. But when the Church once gets It, the Elected is called out and separated, then in the Presence of God, I know it'll be something like the people was there when it takes its Rapture. [Ephesians 5:27]\n\nL-36 I was going to speak this morning on The Rapture, but I just don't have enough voice to do it, and so you just bear with me a little while. Why, I want to speak on the subject of: God's Only Provided Place Of Worship.\n\nL-37 Now, it's a great big text. So let us pray now. And out across the lands this morning, wherever you are, bow your heads just a few moments. Be real sincere now, we're approaching the Word of God, which is God in a letter form.\n\nL-38 Great Author of this Book, \"It is a Seed,\" we are taught, \"that a sower sowed,\" so said the Author. Now, we do realize that a seed will grow if it's in the right kind of ground. So, Father, will You this morning take all the briars and thistles, and unbelief, and skeptic thoughts out of our heart; that the Word of God might grow freely, watered by the Spirit in our heart, that we might become the people of God. Grant it, Father. That's our hearts. Not only to we who have recognized this, but may there be others throughout the country, each one's heart burning with love and tenderness, will go to try to win the lost brother, the lost sister. Grant it today, God. We're looking wholly to You, for You are our guide and our Lord. So we pray that You'll direct us in Your Word today, and give us of Thy blessings. Through Thy grace and in Thy Name we ask it. Amen. [Luke 8:5-8]\n\nL-39 Now, let's take for our text... I want to read from the Book of Deuteronomy, the Old Testament, just for a setting of Scripture. I have a few notes I wrote out quickly after I'd come back from breakfast with Brother Vayle.\n\nL-40 I never did get to thank the man over at that hotel... that restaurant the other night, that paid for our--for our supper. Wife and I and my little girl was over there, and when I went to pay my bill, somebody had paid it. Ever who it was, I thank you. Said, \"The man that set on the end of the bench.\" Course there was a whole group in there that we knowed. Now, I... some kind of a Kickapoo, something like that, the place out here, restaurant we were at. Thank you, ever who it was that did that. Each one of you, God bless you.\n\nL-41 Now, in 16th chapter of Deuteronomy, it's the passover observance. So we wish to read about the first few verses, first four or five, six verses here. Observe the month of Abid, and keep the passover... (That means \"April.\")... the LORD thy God: for in the month of this Abid the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night. Thou shall therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name... Thou shall eat the unleavened bread within it; seven days shall thou eat unleavened, bread--bread therewith,... thou comest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste:... thou mayest remember the--the day when thou comest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. And there shall not be... unleavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there be any thing of the flesh, which thou has sacrificed the first day at the evening, remain all night until the morning. Thou may not sacrifice the passover within any of the gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee: But at the place which the LORD thy God has chosen to place his name in, there thou shall sacrifice the passover at evening, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou comest forth out of Egypt. Now may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of His Word. [Deuteronomy 16:1-6]\n\nL-42 Now, is the microphone got a blur in it? Last night I heard they were. Can you hear all right, all over? You can't hear. [Brother Branham adjusts the microphone--Ed.] Is that better? Is this better, speaking with the microphones down like this? I'm just a little hoarse, so I'm standing close this morning for that purpose, and I hope that Brother Pearry can--can get it out there. Can you hear it all right now? I think they've fixed it up. All right. 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min\n\nL-43 Now, the pla-... The thing I want to speak about this morning is that God has only one place that the worshipper can meet God, only one place. Through the ages many has sought for this secret place of God, through all the ages. Even Job wanted to know where He lived at, \"If I could only go to His house and knock at His door.\" Job wanted to find God's dwelling place, 'cause there God and His family is worshipped together.\n\nL-44 Like yesterday, in the message yesterday morning, we find out that there is a possibility of a person to worship God in vain, with sincere worship. God has all these things fixed out for us, but the thing of it is, we have to search to find where they are. Paul told Timothy to search, and to--to be in season and out of season, ready to give a--a--a word or... of the hope that was within him. [Matthew 15:9], [John 5:39]\n\nL-45 Now, all these things are in there. And we find... Sometime I'd like to come to Shreveport where we just have about two or three weeks just to take thirty minutes a night and just on a teaching, see, just stay right in the Word, these secret passages, see, where we could find out just how to get in. And you just watch, you follow God's direction, there's only one key to each door. That's right. And no other key, no matter how much it looks like it, God has no skeleton key; just got one key. And now, you've got to have that key, or the door won't unlock. No matter how sincere you are, you still can't unlock that door.\n\nL-46 Now, how many was at yesterday's breakfast, the other morning? All right, I think most, at least ninety percent of you, or more. To background this, what I'm going to say, David was anointed king (anointed of God), the greatest king Israel ever had, outside of the Lord Jesus (which is God) the Anointed One. David is his son... or Jesus was David's son according to the lineage, the flesh. And He's to set on David's throne as one... inherit back, the--the prince always inherits the--the king's throne. [Luke 1:31-32]\n\nL-47 Notice, now, that David being anointed, yet with the anointing he did, he got out of the will of the Lord with that anointing; and all the people, not taking the run of the Scripture or the key to this revelation, all of them anointed too, they all, together, shouting and praising God for a thing that looked exactly right: to bring the Word of God back to the house of God. But David was king, not prophet. See? He... There was a prophet in the land to do it by, and God dishonored the whole move because they never used the right key. The door didn't unlock. And now we must remember that, and keep that in mind. There is... Everything of God, one certain way it's to be done, and that settles it. Now, there, God had a one certain Church that He meets the people in, and He will receive you in that Church and no other church. [I Chronicles 13:1-10]\n\nL-48 I've said this because I've been so many time misunderstood, and people has told me... I say, \"Are you a Christian?\" \"I'm Baptist.\" \"Are you a Christian?\" \"I'm a Methodist.\" \"Are you a Christian?\" \"I'm a Pentecostals.\"\n\nL-49 Now, see, that doesn't mean one thing to God. You're just progging with the wrong key. But there is a right key, there is one where God... God never promised to meet you at the Methodist, or at the Baptist, or at Pentecostals, or no other denomination. He. don't even consider the denominations, they're against Him.\n\nL-50 On that long Message, I'll get It at the Tabernacle pretty soon. And then Brother Jack will hear It, and then you can see what you want to do about It, 'cause It'll be taped.\n\nL-51 Now, people act like that God is obligated just to meet them on the basis of their theology. Now, people act like that. They won't associate even with one another. The Trinity or the Pentecost won't associate with the Oneness, neither will the Oneness associate with the Trinity. The Methodist won't with the Baptist, because one is a legalist and the other's a Calvinist, so they have no fellowship at all. And they wind the people's minds around so bad that they even against one another.\n\nL-52 I went to pray, sometime ago, in a hospital room. There was a lady laying there very sick, going under an 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min operation, they expected her to die. Another lady laying there, I was cared to, pray for her. I said to her, \"Would you mind just a moment if I pray?\"\n\nL-53 And she, said, \"Pull that curtain!\" And I said, \"I'm sorry.\" I said, \"I was just going to ask prayer.\" She said, \"Pull that curtain!\" I said, \"Yes, ma'am.\" Her and her son setting there, a regular little Ricky look. And I said, \"Well, aren't you a Christian?\"\n\nL-54 She said, \"We are Methodist!\" Said, \"Well, I never asked you that, I asked you if you was a 'Christian.'\" See? And so she said, \"Pull that curtain!\"\n\nL-55 See, because somebody that wasn't a Methodist was going to offer prayer for a dying woman, which she was too. But because it wasn't associated in her own organization, she didn't even want to hear it or have nothing to do with it. If that ain't a Pharisee, I never seen one!\n\nL-56 Wait till you hear The Trail Of The Serpent. Huh. All right. Now, think now that their denomination is the only one that registers with God: \"God won't hear you unless you're a Methodist, or a Baptist, or a--a Trinity, or a Oneness,\" or something like that. That's wrong!\n\nL-57 And that's my purpose; but if there is such a--a desire in people's minds and heart to be right... I don't believe the woman done it because... or anybody else. A Methodist wouldn't raise up and take up for the Methodist church because he--he knew it was wrong. The man thinks it's right. I don't believe a Trinity would condemn a Oneness, or a Oneness a Trinity and Pentecost, because he wants to be different, he thinks he's right. And you must respect his idea. You know, the blanket stretches both way. But, remember, in all that, if there's something in a man's heart or a woman's heart that they believed that that is \"right,\" then there's got to be somewhere that is right. As I've often said, \"When the deep calls to the deep, there's got to be a deep to respond to that call.\" [Psalms 42:7]\n\nL-58 You know, we've been told that--that a seal once walked upon the bank of the--of the sea, with legs. But now he doesn't have legs, they turned into flaps because he could... had need of the flaps when he took it from the land, a fur-bearing animal to the sea; nature formed him some flaps instead of legs, 'cause he could swim more than he did of his walking.\n\nL-59 I can't think of this great man now that went to the south pole. What was his name? Byrd. They say that he had coats made for some cattle, on this exposition; that he'd taken the cattle for milk. And he made fur coats to keep them cattle from freezing to death. But when he got there, they didn't need any fur coat, nature had growed them one. See? Why? Before there was a fin on a fish's back, there had to be a water for him to swim in or he'd a-never had a fin. There... Before there was a tree to grow in the earth, there had to be an earth first for it to grow in, or there'd been no tree.\n\nL-60 So, you see, as long as there's something in the human heart a-calling for something, there's got to be something out there to respond, to satisfy that call. [Psalms 42:7]\n\nL-61 A woman... An autopsy was held here sometime ago on a woman that died. And the reason, they--they claim, that killed her, she eat onions just constantly, all the time. If she wasn't eating onions, her head would be itching, and everything; they couldn't make it out. So holding the autopsy, they found a growth in the woman of some kind of cells; they had a--a name for it. And they could take that growth and put it in a bowl of onions, and it dissolved the onions overnight. See? What was it? It was something in the woman a-calling for onion, and if there had been no onions there'd a-been no growth.\n\nL-62 In other words, there has to be a Creator first, before there could be a creation. See?\n\nL-63 Now, if in the human heart there is a longing, like Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Catholic, all these others, trying to find that one true way, and they're told by their priests and pastors, and so forth, that \"This is the true way.\" They say, the priest says, \"There's no salvation outside the Catholic church.\" 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min\n\nL-64 Well, each church takes his... their own idea. Some of them won't admit it, but they do it by their action. Your action speaks louder than your word. It's just a... In otherwise, they're just more of a hypocrite than the Catholic is. The Catholic confesses it right out, \"I believe that this is the only thing,\" but they won't do that. They hide it, but their actions prove what they're thinking. See?\n\nL-65 Now, there's got to be then one place, because there is a desire in the human heart to find It. And I think that the Word of God has the answer for everything that we have need of. So God has the answer, and let's search for it now in the Scriptures. And then if God will show us by the Scriptures the only place, the only ground, (the only denomination, if it's so), the only way that God will meet a man, then we should hold to that 'cause we found the Truth of the Bible, what It says.\n\nL-66 Now, the word Deuteronomy, the word itself means \"two laws,\" the word Deuteronomy. And God has two laws. The two laws: one of them is disobedience to the Word, and die; and the other one is obedience to the Word, and live. That's the two laws, and Deuteronomy means those two laws. They have both been absolutely displayed to us in the Scripture. One of them is death, the other one is Life; Life and death. God deals only in Life, Satan only in death. And these was displayed to the world publicly, openly before every eye, and there's no excuse for it. One of them was, displayed on Mount Sinai when the law was given, which condemned the whole human race to death; the other one was give on Mount Calvary, that brought the whole human race to Life, when the penalty was paid in Jesus Christ. The two laws of Deuteronomy was fulfilled in these two, great things. [Deuteronomy 30:19]\n\nL-67 I want you to notice again, there was also two covenants give. One covenant was given to Adam, which was on conditions, like law: \"If you will not touch this, then you will live; but if you touch this, you will die.\" That was a law. Then there was another law given to Abraham, which was by grace, unconditionally: \"I have saved you and your seed after you.\" Amen! That is a type of Calvary, not the type of--of--of Adam covenant, it's a Abrahamic covenant. [Genesis 3:3]\n\nL-68 But now we hear Him say there is only one place where He will meet man to worship. You heard it right here in the text. We'll refer to it, back, in a few minutes.\n\nL-69 Then if there's only one place that God meets man, we had better be very careful. Now let's lay aside our traditions this morning, and... in this Sunday-school lesson, and be very sure that we find that one place. Because, God has said here, He will not receive you in any other place. Any other church, He won't receive you in. Only in His Church, the only place He'll receive you.\n\nL-70 Now, \"What'd you say, Brother Branham? If I'm sincere?\" No.\n\nL-71 Remember, Jesus talked to some sincere people, the worshippers of His day, and He said, \"In vain do you worship Me.\" True, genuine worship from the bottom of their hearts. \"In vain do you worship Me, teaching for doctrine the commandments of man,\" or their denominational creed. Sincere, reverently, just as religious as they can be. And that wasn't new just with the Pharisees. Cain and Abel, the first two worshippers that was borned, natural birth here, on earth, absolutely came in the same attitude. [Matthew 15:9]\n\nL-72 Cain was just as religious as Abel was. They both built altars. They both loved God. They both made sacrifices. They both worshipped. They both paid tithe. They both done everything just alike. But Abel, by faith which is \"the revelation,\" the Word of God revealed, made plain, showed out, and vindicated. Glory! Cain made an offering, but God didn't vindicate it. God required worship, and Cain made the offering; but God didn't vindicate it. But by the true channel... [Genesis 4:3-4], [Hebrews 11:4]\n\nL-73 You say, \"Well, my church is It. My...\"\n\nL-74 Wait just a minute. God interprets His Own Word by Its terms that He spoke in. See, Cain said, \"I am religious. I am a lover of my Maker. I offer to Thee this fine altar. I offer to You this sacrifice. I built all these things up, Lord, because I love you.\" Abel said the same thing. Now it's the one that's vindicated, the one that's proven. And God come down and received Abel's sacrifice, because by revelation he had struck the true channel of God that was accepted. [Hebrews 11:4] 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min\n\nL-75 Now watch that Cain spirit come right down through the Scripture, right on to this very last day. Fundamental? Just as fundamental as the other one was.\n\nL-76 Look at the prophet Balaam and the prophet Moses. Both of them with seven altars, Jehovah's altars, blood on each one; and not only that, but rams on each one. In numerology, exactly the right number, seven, \"perfect,\" seven rams. Just exactly alike, both altars. As fundamental as one was, the other one was also. But who did God vindicate? See? See? The one that was in His Word. Fundamental doesn't mean too much; it's the revelation of God. [Jude 1:11]\n\nL-77 Now think! These man, why was they called and was put in this condition (these Pharisees) by Jesus, said, \"In vain you worship Me\"? Worship Him: genuine worship, true worship from their hearts. \"You... In vain you worship Me.\" Why? \"Teaching for doctrine your tradition of man, therefore you make the commandments of God of no effect to the people.\" [Matthew 15:9]\n\nL-78 If I taught you a Methodist message, it would take no effect on you, this is Bride time. If Moses taught the message of Noah, it would take no effect. If Jesus taught Moses' message, it would take no effect. Because the predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that's give for that seed. See? It won't grow any other condition. It must be the condition that grows it. [Hebrews 11:7], [Acts 7:35-36]\n\nL-79 Now, you can take a chicken egg and put it in a incubator, which should be under a hen, but it'll hatch anyhow. Put it under a pup it would hatch. It's the warmness, the condition that makes it hatch. So it has to be under condition. You could take a good live egg and put it under a dead hen, it won't hatch. See? See, it's the condition.\n\nL-80 Well, that's the way it is in this age that we're living in, you've got to find what is God's way of doing it for this age. That's what Martin Luther found, that's what John Wesley found, that's what the Pentecostals found in their age. God's age and time to do it.\n\nL-81 Now, the Pentecostals. That brother, one... I believe his... one of his eyes was out, a colored brother who really started the Pentecostal message in California, old Azusa Street. He was laughed at, and because he was a negro he was made fun of, but he brought a message for that age. Just a little body, a fellow could hardly sign his own name, but the Lord had revealed to him that this was the age for the restoration of those gifts, and they come. No matter what said, it come. But everybody got in the atmosphere of it, and seen it was that age, and seen God vindicating that those people could speak with tongues, and so forth, it happened. But then when he went and pinned it down that \"this is the only evidence,\" that killed it. See? Goes right on, see. That did it. Then they started separating this, that, and making denominations; and one's coming on a cloud, and the other one's come in a bush. And oh, my, there it goes.\n\nL-82 That's what denominations does. See? God is not a author of denomination, because denomination is Babylon, and He's not the author of confusion. We see her all... You don't have to be even intellectual to see that. It's Babylon! See? Tradition (think of it), sincere people. Now, still, because they believe that, there still needs to be one sincere place where God meets. [I Corinthians 14:33]\n\nL-83 Now notice verse 2. \"Worship in the place that I have chosen.\" The sacrifice, of course, where they worship, go do sacrifice. \"The place that I chose; not what you chose, what man chose. But what I have chosen, you worship in this place.\" There shows there's then only one place, others is vain. It must be not of your choice, but it must be His choice. [Deuteronomy 16:2]\n\nL-84 \"Well, I don't have to go to the church.\" Or, \"You are so narrow-minded! Why, you'll even fuss at women about preaching, and... or women about bobbing their hair, and man about these other things. Why, you're so narrow-minded!\" [I Timothy 2:11-12], [I Corinthians 11:5-10, 13]\n\nL-85 All right, you don't have to take God's Word about it, you go on out where, they do that at. See? And you'll find out it's in the Scripture, so, \"In vain do they worship Me.\" See? Jesus spoke of the same thing. See? [Matthew 15:9]\n\nL-86 That every little jot, everything, you must be faithful in. Always the little--the little vine, the little--the little fox that spoils the vine. Sometimes you leave... It's not the big things you do, it's the little things you leave undone. Remember, a chain is only its strongest at its weakest link. \"Blessed are they that do all the commandments of God, 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min that they might have a right to enter in.\" Do all God said, and It said for women to have long hair. [Revelation 22:14]\n\nL-87 You say... A man told me not long ago, said, \"I don't preach a clothes-line religion.\" I said, \"Then you're not preaching the Gospel.\" Yeah.\n\nL-88 God laid it out there, He said what to do. And you either do it... That's your natural, reasonable thing. What little thing... what... the little insignificant. Jesus said, \"Blessed are they that would take all the little thing, do the little things.\" And a woman to let her hair grow, that's just a... why, it's just something she can do, and she won't even do that. She won't even do that. [Revelation 22:14]\n\nL-89 \"Oh, teach us the great things.\" How can you teach the great things, when you won't do the simple, common thing? Because, you see, your motive and your objective is wrong.\n\nL-90 It's your love to God, \"Lord, I don't care what You want me to do, I'm willing to do it.\" Then you're getting somewhere, but if you don't do it that way, the way He said do it...\n\nL-91 It's His choosing, \"The place that I have chosen.\" That's where you worship with your sacrifice.\" [Deuteronomy 16:2]\n\nL-92 You put... Cain brought his sacrifice, Abel brought his, it depends on what place you take it into. If you take it into the place where, He's chosen, it'll be all right, He'll accept it; if it's not, He won't accept it. Don't care... it's the same sacrifice, whatever it is, it's still un-... rejected, unless it's brought to that one certain place. [Deuteronomy 16:2]\n\nL-93 Now we want to find out where we want to bring this sacrifice. If we could find out... We all want to go to Heaven. Don't we? And we all know we've done wrong. We all believe that Jesus is the Sacrifice. Now we want to know where to take Him, it'll be--it'll be accepted. See? That's right. The Bible tells us where to take Him at, and then it'll be accepted; outside of there, it won't be accepted. [I Peter 1:19]\n\nL-94 Let us notice here also the place that He chose for the sacrifice to be laid, the place that He chose to put the sacrifice. You can't put it on any of these gates; but the place that He chose to put it, He also put His Name in that place. See, that's what He said here. He chose to put His Name in it. Now let us search the Scriptures for this place, for that is the place where He put His Name.\n\nL-95 Now let's read from the text. And I had a little note laying here that I... this morning, come to me. Let's take the 2nd verse of this chapter. Now, I don't want to hold too long, on account of the people. on these hookups out here. Now the 2nd verse of this 16th chapter: Thou shall therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of thy flocks and thy herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to put his name there. [Deuteronomy 16:2, 6]\n\nL-96 Now, you can't take this... your sincerity and all that you want to confess, you just can't take it to the Methodist altar, to a Baptist altar, to a Pentecostal altar, but there is a altar somewhere that He chose that He... to put His Name in it, and He would meet you at that place. Now, if you get everything running just right, it's going to run; everything's set in order. If there's a short in that wire, that light won't come on; because it's been grounded. And when you'll take one of God's Words or one of His places, and in your own heart have selfish objectives, it'll ground the power of God right there. If you do it because you want to be smart, you want to be different from somebody else, or something, right there it's grounded, it'll blow the fuse. You're wrong. You've got to come with sincerity, with all your heart. Your motives and your objective, place that on God. Then search for His place, find where He said, and bring it there. See?\n\nL-97 Look at Martha and Mary. When Jesus had come back, after He had taught them this Gospel (the Light of His day, Him being Messiah), He was hated, rejected. Oh, the Pharisees and churches despised Him. But Lazaras had died, the brother which was a bosom friend to Him. He let him lay there; and they sent for Him, He didn't even come. [John 11:21]\n\nL-98 But watch Martha, her attitude. She said, \"Lord, if Thou would have been here.\" Give Him His right title: Lord, capital L-o-r-d, Yahweh, Jehovah. Glory! \"If Thou would have been here, my brother would not have died.\" Life and death can't associate in the same channel, or same house. \"Thou would... He would have not have died.\" [John 11:21] 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min\n\nL-99 Jesus said to her, \"I am the resurrection and Life,\" saith God. When He said first, \"Thy brother shall live again.\" [John 11:23-25]\n\nL-100 She said, \"Yes, Lord, I truly believe that. As a Jewess, I believe that there will be a general resurrection of the dead; and I believe my brother was just as loyal and sincere in worship. And I believe that You are that Messiah, that said in the Bible, because God vindicating His Word in You shows that You're the messenger of this hour. You are that Messiah. I believe that You are that Christ that was to come, because Your works testify that God has sent You here to be that Messiah.\" Oh, my! Watch the cogs begin to come in place now. See? [John 11:23-24]\n\nL-101 Now, she had a right to say, \"Why didn't You come raise my brother? Why didn't You heal him? You healed others. Your very best friend, and now look what happened.\" No, no, that kind of objective don't get no where.\n\nL-102 \"I believe that You're exactly what You're identified in the Scripture to be. I believe this is the day that the Messiah should come; we've been looking for it. I don't care what the rest of them say. I believe with all my heart that what I have seen and heard by the Word, that the Word is vindicated in You, that You are that Messiah.\" See, way down in her, she--she had something to ask for, but she had to come to the right channel.\n\nL-103 What if she'd run up there and say, \"And then You tell me You're that Messiah! And not even the courtesy, gentlemen enough to even answer our request; when we fed You and housed You, and everything, and took up for You, and left our churches, as You commanded us to get out of them denominations.\" See? \"And here we've left it, and now we're counted offcasts and renegades. And everything that we've done for You, and then not even the common courtesy to answer my call?\" Now, actually, she had that right.\n\nL-104 Like you say about your short hair, \"I'm an American citizen, I can wear shorts, do anything I want to, not illegal.\" That's your rights, but a sheep always forfeits its rights. Uh-huh. If you're a lamb, you ain't got nothing but wool, he forfeits that. That's his God-given rights, but he forfeits it.\n\nL-105 \"I have a right to join any denomination.\" That's exactly right, but you forfeit that. See? She forfeit all that she had rights, to, to recognize the Word of God manifested right there before her.\n\nL-106 He said, \"I am the resurrection and Life. He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. Whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?\" See, there was one more little clause she hadn't come in line with. See? [John 11:25]\n\nL-107 \"Yea, Lord! I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God!\" O brother, everything was ready to spark off right then. See? [John 11:27]\n\nL-108 \"Where have you laid him?\" See? And you know what took place. [John 11:34]\n\nL-109 See, you've got to get in that right place before He will receive your sacrifice. See, got to come into it. Watch.... in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.Thou shall eat no leavened, bread in it;... [Deuteronomy 16:2-3]\n\nL-110 What does that typify in the sacrifice? Don't mix it with any creed, got to be the Word. \"No leavened bread.\" Leaven is the... You know what a leaven is in anything. \"A little leaven leavens the whole lump,\" the whole lump is the Body. You can't put one speck of denomination or creed into Christ. No, sir, it won't work. [I Corinthians 5:6]\n\nL-111 You remember the last Thursday night's message? Your old husband must be dead. Right. Your new Husband is the Word.... seven days shall thou eat unleavened bread therein,... [Deuteronomy 16:3]\n\nL-112 \"Seven days,\" what does that typify? The complete Seven Church Ages, seven days. Why'd they have to eat it seven days? Before what? Before going out. And the whole church age, from the beginning to the end, has to live only on the Word of God of that age. So your Roman creed, Methodist, Baptist, and Pentecostal creed's all dead.\n\nL-113 Now watch. ... therein, even the bread of affliction;... (Persecuted for It; Luther, Wesley, Pentecostals; all persecuted, and so will you.)... for thou comest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste:... thou mayest remain the day when... remember the day when thou comest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min And there shall be no leavened bread seen in... with thee in all thy coast seven days;... [Deuteronomy 16:3-4]\n\nL-114 In the beautiful Bride of Christ, after Her death through the Dark Ages by the Roman empire, that She had to die, \"Unless a corn of wheat falls into the ground.\" The Bridegroom had to come, the perfect Masterpiece of God. You all heard my message on that. [John 12:24]\n\nL-115 And I stood down in Los Angeles at Forest Lawn, one day, and my heart jumped. How many's ever been in Forest Lawn? There is a... the statue of Moses by--by... -angelo, I believe it is Michelangelo. And it's a perfect statue, all but on the right knee; there is a nick about a half inch deep. And the guide... I was looking, and he pointed it out to me. He said, \"Michelangelo had spent a lifetime of trying to--to make... He was a sculptor, and he was trying to make the image of Moses. Back in his mind, he had in mind what Moses should look like. He had that in his heart, what Moses should look like. And then he spent his lifetime; chisel a little here, and rub it; stand back and look at it. Year after year after year, he worked on it. Finally when it was completed, and he stepped back and laid down his rag and his hammer, he looked at the statue. It was so perfect the image of Moses that he had in his heart, till he got so beside himself, he grabbed the hammer and struck it, hollered, 'Speak!\"' It's called Michelangelo's Masterpiece. That great something in that sculptor, that vision that he had of what Moses ought to be with, was only portraying in type of the great Father God.\n\nL-116 He had in His heart, before the foundation of the world, a Son, because He is a Father. But it was still in the genes of His Word. And He created a man, and He had to put him on free moral agency, but that man fell. But the great Sculptor, God, who made man from the dust of the earth, He didn't settle for that, He started making man again. And He made a Noah, he died drunk. He made a Moses that failed to keep His Word. He made prophets that run in the time of trouble. And He kept building and molding until after while He wanted a--a masterpiece, to reflect Him, His nature, what was in His heart what a son should be.\n\nL-117 One day, down Jordon, after that Masterpiece had been formed and made, there He come sending down in a... on the wings of a Dove, said, \"This is Him!\" He, was so enthused with this Masterpiece until He struck Him on Calvary, that He would die, for the, rest of us was imperfect; that through the shedding of His Blood, He, might bring many masterpieces (being a Bride) to His Son. Masterpiece is scarred because the enthusiasm of God to see such a Masterpiece, He, struck Him for us all. See? There He died, to perfect we who are imperfect. The Masterpiece. [Romans 5:8]\n\nL-118 Notice in here. He said:... seven days shall you eat this unleavened bread... [Deuteronomy 16:3]\n\nL-119 Now, bread is typed. Jesus said, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word.\" Not just--just a Word here and there as denominations would have you believe It. But the Word of God is perfect! It's God Himself in letter form, called a \"Seed.\" And the right kind of unadulterated faith in that Word will bring that Seed to its Life. [Matthew 4:4], [Psalms 19:7]\n\nL-120 That's exactly what you see at night in the discernments, and all these other things, because it's a promise that God made. And He stood by me and told. me that, and told me these \"fakers would rise up, but hold steady.\" I believe It. And no selfish motive, to hurt anybody, but to be reverent to God and to do the work that He called me to do, that's why I say these things. And God confirms it back, and receives the offer and the sacrifice, by vindicating it to be the Truth. No question to It! Now watch that Word!\n\nL-121 Now, we notice here, \"Seven days,\" that's for every church age. Now, as that Masterpiece had to die, in order to be resurrected to redeem us all. Then He had a church set in order at Pentecost, but that Church had to go through a sacrifice; and the Roman world killed it, put it in the ground.\n\nL-122 As this author of this book, I can't think of it now, made so much fun of me, and said, \"Of all of the devils, it's William Branham.\" See, that's what the Devil tries to think. He said, \"Visions and things,\" said, \"that's of the Devil.\" He said, \"Oh, he's some kind of a hypnotist, or working in super sensory perception.\" The intellectual world always trying to figure It out. 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min\n\nL-123 That's where they tried to figure out Jesus. \"How do You do these things? What done it?\" [Matthew 21:23]\n\nL-124 He said, \"I'll ask you a question. Was the ministry of John the Baptist... Was it of God or was it of man?\" See? [Matthew 21:25] Said, \"We can't say.\" Said, \"Neither do I tell you.\" That's right, and went on. From henceforth no man asked Him anything. See? Just cut them off, He didn't tell them nothing about It; none of their business. He had a work to do and He finished it. [Matthew 21:27]\n\nL-125 God help us to do the same thing. We don't have to answer the Devil's questions, that's right, \"If thou be, do so-and-so.\" You're responsible for that Gospel, a preacher is, and that's all; not how It's written, it's just responsible for saying It. [Luke 4:3], [Matthew 27:40], [Luke 23:37], [Matthew 4:3], [John 10:24]\n\nL-126 And as a servant, if you're a prophet, you're responsible to God. And if the visions that comes it lightens this Scripture and shows what It is, you're responsible for every Word that's in that Bible, 'cause It was all wrote by the same kind of people you are. \"God of old moved, by the prophets, and wrote the Ho-... the Holy Bible.\" See? And no genuine prophet of God could deny one Word of It, but believe every Word and preach the same. And then God's obligated out of that channel to make that Word come to pass just exactly the way It's promised, the Seed will grow. [II Peter 1:21]\n\nL-127 Now notice again, quickly, we find here that all seven days that this bread was to be eat, through Seven Church Ages. Now, when it had to die and go into the ground.\n\nL-128 And this critic that talked about me, said, \"Of a God that you people worship, that could set in the Dark Ages and watch them mothers, pregnant, some of them with little babies in their arms, sincere people, be throwed into the arena and the lions tear them to pieces, and them screaming; hang them upon crosses and burn them; strip the women naked, young virgins, and throw theirselves back like this, and turn lions in on them.\" Said, \"A God that could set in Heaven, supposed to be on His throne, and looked down and say He, enjoys it.\" [Hebrews 11:36-37]\n\nL-129 So then, see, that's the intellectual conception which is of the Devil. If the man had been spiritual, he would have knowed that that corn of wheat has to die, it had to be buried in a Roman cathedral.\n\nL-130 But then the first little sprout of Life come forth in the reformation by Martin Luther, that, \"The just shall not live by a blessed kosher that a priest blessed, but by the Word of God. 'The just shall live by faith!'\" It brought two sprigs, the corn of wheat begin to grow. [Romans 1:17]\n\nL-131 Then along come John Wesley and added to that. (There was many of the others, that... Zwingli and them come forth and denied the virgin birth, and it just died down). But along come the Methodist, the tassel, the pollen, the missionary day. And they preached sanctification; added the tassel.\n\nL-132 Then along come the Pentecostals in the shuck, so much, to deceive the Elected. Looked like a real grain of wheat, open it up, there's no wheat at all. But the Life's passing through the shuck.\n\nL-133 Now, have you noticed, every three years after a--a great meeting, what takes place? A denomination. This is twenty years and no denomination. Dear dying Lamb, may it never do that. If I go in this generation, may the people who believe this Message never stand still for a denomination! God will... You'll die right in your track! Remember that! The very hour that you mention denomination among you, I don't care how sincere you are, take man for your leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm this Word, that's the hour you die! The genuine Seed cannot, because there's nothing left after the seed, it's the same thing was back at the beginning. It's the Bride that fell into the ground to bring forth the corn of wheat again.\n\nL-134 Notice:... seven days shall you eat unleavened bread... [Deuteronomy 16:3]\n\nL-135 And there shall be with the Bride...\n\nL-136 Now, you people that had that old shouting Methodist mother, and so forth, that you wondered \"If she didn't 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min speak in tongues, she ain't going to be there.\" That's a lie! She was that same Holy Spirit that you have today, but it was impossible for them... not restoration of gifts. But all seven days, just eat the unleavened bread, the Word. Them, back, them that denominated, they're dead. They're stalk, they'll just be gathered and burned. But the Life's going right on through. And what happened? All the Life that was in the stalk, in the tassel, in the shuck, all winds up in the wheat. And that same Holy Ghost that brought Luther, brought Wesley, brought the Pentecostals, winds up in the Bride at the resurrection.\n\nL-137 \"Seven days, eat unleavened bread.\" No leaven shall be found amongst the Bride, no--no word added, no nothing. Remember, one word caused every death that's in the earth; every illegitimate child was borned because Eve, the first church, the bride of the first Adam, doubted God's Word and accepted a denominational, or a intellectual, or a school exceptions of It; because It was reasoned out, and \"Surely, God is a good God.\" God is a good God, but He's also a just God. We must keep His Word! School, she accepted it. [Genesis 3:1-5], [Galatians 5:9]\n\nL-138 There's where some of you seminary boys, no doubt a call in your life, but you run off to some Bible school to have this doctrine injected in you, and there's where you die... Stay with God and His Word. They won't let you; or, you can't even belong to their congregation, won't accept you on the platform. So let them have it, let the dead bury the dead, let's follow Christ the Word.\n\nL-139 Now, seven days there shall be no leaven mixed in the Bride, the Church, seven days. [Deuteronomy 16:3], [Galatians 5:9]\n\nL-140 Now notice. Now as no... And there shall be no leavened bread seen in thee in all thy coast seven days;... (The sacrifice here is a type: the Bride coming forth from the Sacrifice which is Christ.)... neither shall there be any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificed the first day at evening,... [Deuteronomy 16:4]\n\nL-141 And remember--remember how we just went through the Church Ages? The messenger to the church always comes just at the dying of the other church age, always. The dying of the Pentecost brings forth the rapturing of the Bride. See? The dying of Luther brought forth Wesley. See? The dying of Wesley brought forth Pentecost. The dying of Pentecost brings forth the Message now. Here, it's right here, patterned all through the Scripture. There's not a scripture in the Bible but what hooks right one with the other. See? All these types. I have no education, but I have the Holy Spirit that shows me through another channel that teaches me that from nature; and that's by the Word. Has to be the Word, brings His promise. ... flesh,... the sacrifice the first day... even, remain all night until the morning. [Deuteronomy 16:4]\n\nL-142 Now, even Luther, he had the Truth and taught the church \"the just shall live by faith.\" You don't want to hang onto that being the full doctrine, in the Methodist age. What shall you do? Burn it with fire. What was the type of? The denomination that comes out of that Word is a shuck, the stalk, the husks, must be burnt with fire. That denominational part that it come through must not remain, got to die. Don't leave it till the breaking of another--another age, burn it up! He's talking now to the Bride here, just the Bride, coming up through every age.\n\nL-143 Notice how beautiful, \"The lamb's blood.\" These are Christ's Body, the Sacrifice: the lamb's blood on the door. Now, remember, the lamb was slain which was a type of Christ.\n\nL-144 Or we could take plenty of time, but I haven't got... just a few more minutes to stay here. I may just have to stop and start up again tonight, see, because we're taking too long. It's... I got twenty pages of this in here, of notes, on this one subject.\n\nL-145 Notice now, on this, the--the lamb was Christ in figurative form. Or did I say that right? Type; Christ was the Lamb. He was to be a male, the first from the old mother ewe; or yew, which ever way you choose to call it. It must be her first. And he must be tested first to see if there is a blemish on him.\n\nL-146 Now, Christ was tested; the lamb first from the mother ewe, Mary the virgin. And was tested by what? Satan against the Word. When he hit Eve, she fell; hit Moses, he fell; but when he flew up against Christ, and tried to quote the Scripture to Him wrong, uh-huh, he found out that that wasn't Moses. See? He was tested. What did... he turn 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min around, he said, \"If thou be the Son of God. Now they tell me you perform miracles, and they tell me that the Messiah's to do that. Now, if it is, you're hungry, you haven't eat, turn these bread into... these stones into bread, and eat.\" [Matthew 4:3], [Luke 4:3]\n\nL-147 He said, \"It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.'\" Your creed, so forth. But by what? Every Word! A part of the Word? \"Every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" That's what man lives by. See? The Lamb was tested, see if there's anywhere He had fallen. [Matthew 4:4], [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-148 The Pharisees, \"O Rabbi, you young prophet, we think you're wonderful. You are good.\" \"Why call thou Me good? There's only one good, and that's God. Do you believe that?\" [Matthew 19:17] \"Oh, yes. God.\"\n\nL-149 \"Well, I am He, then.\" Uh-huh. \"You said there's only One good. Why do you call Me 'good,' when you don't believe I'm God?\" Uh-huh. \"So why do you call Me good? What makes you do that? What inspired you to say that, when you know there's only one good, and that's God?\"\n\nL-150 \"We know Thou respects not the dignity of man nor the word of their position. We know it.\" Try... He knowed that hypocrite. See? [Matthew 22:16]\n\nL-151 He was tested to see where He was standing, see, tested in every manner, tested like we are tested. But there was no giving in, to Him, at all. No, sir! That was the Son of God.\n\nL-152 And the lamb was tested, and was kept up for fourteen days. That was two Sabbaths, or two ages. One's for the Jews, which they offered the lamb in type; one's for the Gentile, who has the real Lamb, and all of them was, made perfect by believing this Lamb would come. But He was, tempted fourteen... or examined fourteen days, He was the Word. [Exodus 12:5-6]\n\nL-153 And you can examine the Old Testament, say \"It condemns the New.\" You're wrong! The Old Testament only bears record of the New.\n\nL-154 A man was going to challenge me not long ago, said, \"What's the matter with him?\" Said, \"Well, he even teaches out of the Old Testament.\" A Christian preacher, think of that. Said, \"The Old Testament's dead and gone.\" Oh, no! Oh, no! It's only a schoolmaster, it shows what's wrote on the wall. See? Right.\n\nL-155 Now, see, fourteen days it was tested, that was Christ. Now notice, then He was killed in the evening time, should be killed, the lamb was. Christ died in the evening time, the afternoon. And then notice, then he was also... [Exodus 12:6], [Matthew 27:45, 50]\n\nL-156 The blood was to be put on the doorposts, see, which the blood is the life of the animal. \"Thou shall eat the flesh thereof; but the blood thereof which is the life, pour it out.\" See? It was to be... The blood was to be put on the lintel of the doorposts of the house wherein the sacrifice was accepted. Glory! What is the Life? The Name. That... He placed the name of the person... Go up to the door, and you look, see what name's on the door before you ring the bell. See? The blood was put on the lintel of the door as a type of what the sacrifice was on the inside. [Deuteronomy 12:23], [Exodus 12:7]\n\nL-157 Now we're going to find the place of worship, right through there, coming through that Blood. Notice, the blood on the door was speaking the name of what was going... was on the inside, they were in there. Our place of worship, the Lamb, is the Word. We know that.\n\nL-158 Now, verse 4, notice, \"Leave no bread, leave none of the sacrifice,\" or, take one from, one age to another. [Deuteronomy 16:4]\n\nL-159 Try to go back and say, \"Well, now, we're Lutherans, we want to come up here,\" you've got to die to the Lutheran age to be borned in the Wesley age. You have to die in the Wesley age to be borned in a Pentecostal age. And you have to die in the Pentecostal age, leave nothing of it left, burn it with fire, because it's going to be burnt like, the stalk that the wheat comes up out of. The stalk, the denomination, it's got to be burned. So don't bring your denomination over in the new Message. This is the Word now. That's what denominated, the stalk; it carried It, that's right; but It come over 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min into here, then the stalk died. It was a carrier, the denomination, but the Word goes right on. Yeah, the Word goes right on.\n\nL-160 Now take the 5th and the 6th verse. Notice, \"Not...\" Now let's take the 5th and the 6th verse. Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of the gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee: [Deuteronomy 16:5]\n\nL-161 Now remember, \"Not in any of these gates.\" The Lord permits you to have these denominations, see, \"these gates.\" But at the place which the LORD... God shall choose to place his name in,...\n\nL-162 That's the Gate, the only place. Not many, \"these gates,\" but God has a Gate. [Deuteronomy 16:6]\n\nL-163 You say, \"Every morning I enter the Methodist gate.\" That's the church. \"Every morning I go into the Catholic gate.\" Uh-huh. Well, the Lord let His people go in and out them gates. God's got people in the Catholic church, Methodist church, Presbyterian church, all of them, Pentecostals. Sure, but don't... you don't worship the Lord in that gate. See? But the Lord has a certain gate. Glory! He has a gate. But at the place which the LORD thy God... choose to place his name in, there... shall thou sacrifice the passover at evening,... [Deuteronomy 16:6]\n\nL-164 When did Rebekah find Isaac? When did Eliezer call her to be the bride? Evening time! It shall be Light about the evening time, The way to Glory you will surely find; In that water way is the Light today, Buried in the precious Name of Jesus; Young and old, repent of all your sins, The Holy Ghost will surely enter in; The evening Lights have come, It is a fact that God and Christ are one.\n\nL-165 That was the beginning of It, now she stayed right on into the Bride Light. See what I mean?\n\nL-166 I better close here, start again tonight, 'cause I don't want you to leave this, you see. No, no, it's--it's dinner time. Well, well, I got too many notes wrote here. Oh, my! How about tonight, would that be better? Huh? Well, if you... You want to just try a little further? All right, let's go a little further then, we'll hurry right quick. How's that?\n\nL-167 Now, go in at the what? \"You, shall not go into any gate that the Lord God has given you, but at the gate that the Lord will put His Name in.\" Not go into the house of the--of the gate which is the door. That right? God's going to put His Name at the door, and you shall not... That's the gate that enters into the place of worship, the sanctuary. You don't go in there with your sacrifice to any of these gates, but in the gate that the Lord God chooses to put His Name in. See? [Deuteronomy 16:5]\n\nL-168 Now, has He did that? Where is that gate? In St. John 10, Jesus said, \"I am the gate, the door. I am the door to the House of God. I am a door to the sheepfold.\" Not the goatfold, the sheepfold. See? \"I am the door to the sheepfold. A man may enter into this door, safe.\" [John 10:7, 9]\n\nL-169 And now we could linger a long time on that. But, to save time, He is the door to that sheepfold. Now, we want to notice here. The shadows and types are really in view right here, but I... if I take that page I'd... it's going to hold you awhile. [John 10:1-10]\n\nL-170 All right, notice, this brings in perfect view, Jesus Christ. For all the Old Testament is type of Him, all the feasts, all the worships, and everything. And I've got wrote down here, under these line of Scriptures, \"Explain it.\" There's where it'd take a long time. Explain how all the feasts... Even the meal offering was a type of Christ. Let's just take that one.\n\nL-171 One time there was a--a school called the school of the ministers, or school of prophets. They trained up, educated prophets. And there was a genuine, God-called prophet one time went up to visit them. They were going to 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min show the old prophet a little courtesy, so one. of them went out and picked a big bunch of what he thought to be peas; but they were poison gourds, and he was going to feed them all on that. [II Kings 4:38-40]\n\nL-172 Oh! How many seminary lapfuls have we had! See? Right. They're cooking up something. See? They got Methodist lapful, Baptist lapful, Pentecostal lapfuls. But, you see, they are the second growth, the kind that can be pruned off the tree. See, not in the main Vine. Bearing lemons, grapefruit, and so forth; not oranges, but professing to be citrus.\n\nL-173 Notice again. Now, in this--in this, when Elijah come around and looked at them, and seen that it was poison gourds that would kill every one of them, they said, \"Alas, we got death in the pot!\" [II Kings 4:40]\n\nL-174 He said, \"Bring me a handful of meal.\" And he throwed meal into it, he said, \"Now it's all right, eat what you want.\" It changed death to life. [II Kings 4:41]\n\nL-175 And the meal offering that was given to... Christ, He was the Meal offering, and the meal offering must be ground with a certain burr that made every little chunk of meal the same, shows that He's the same yesterday, today, and, forever. He's the same thing to put in your denomination and it'll live, the Word! Christ is the Word, all the types of everything: the tabernacle, the--the--the shewbread, everything. The broken kosher under the plate was His broken body, that the Jews can't explain yet why they do it. See? And all these other things typed Him.\n\nL-176 Now, then, Him in view, we see now all denominations and creed left behind; for He is the pure, unchangeable Word of God, which is the unleavened bread, St. John 1. That's right, He's the unleavened Bread. So you add this, or add that, it's a leavened added to that what's already been originally give for you. [Revelation 22:18-19]\n\nL-177 Looky here. What's killing the race today? They take and hybrid things. And when you hybrid it, you kill it. \"Oh, it looks more pretty.\" Sure! Hybrid corn: corn flakes, all the other cereals that comes out of corn. Hybrid corn: great, big, nice long stalks, and great big ears, look like twice as good as the other. But it's death! Science even found that out. See? Don't cross it, it'll kill you.\n\nL-178 Now, here, let me show you. The other day I was watering some flowers in my yard. And the lady had some hybrid flowers that was in the little pot here, the little planter beside the house. We have to water them things at least three times a week, or four, or they'll die. And there stood the original plant out in the yard. It hasn't rained there for six month, just as dry... If it rains, in ten minutes you can blow a dust. But that little fellow laying out there, just prettier and brighter than the hybrid was with all the water. You keep that water off of him, he'll die. But where did he get his water? And another thing, you have to go all along spraying them every day or two, to keep the lice off of him. They don't, the lice will eat him up, he's so tender and soft. But there ain't a louse that'll get on that original. No, no! He'll crawl up to him and crawl away. He's original! See what the hybriding has done?\n\nL-179 That's the same thing in the church. They're trying to mix the denomination with the Word, to make the... try to make the Word say what the denomination says. And when you do that, you have to spray them, and baby them, and--and give them gold stars to come to Sunday school, and everything else. That's right. When, a genuine, borned-again Christian, borned with the Word of God, he's rugged. That's you. The lice and things of the world don't bother him. He's an eagle, he flies plumb past it. See, soars in the heavenly. See? It is true. Nothing...\n\nL-180 Notice. Now, we must understand that here, the denomination, creeds, and anything that's added of the a-leavened bread cannot mix with the unleavened bread. And the Bible foreshadows here in the sacrament, of going into the worship, that no unleaven can be taken with you, and God will receive it. [Matthew 16:11-12]\n\nL-181 You say, \"I'm Methodist.\" Right there you die! \"I'm Pentecostal's.\" You die! I am of Christ. That's right. You've got to stand on something. That's right. You're--you're standing on something. Churchill once said, held up two fingers and said, \"We are got the victory.\" And England stood by that, they believed Churchill.\n\nL-182 And believe it or not, this morning, you are standing by something. There's only one thing that you can live and stand by, and that's Christ, the Word. True! 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min\n\nL-183 Notice, nothing in the Bible types the denominations but Babylon. And Babylon was founded by Nimrod, and Nimrod was a renegade. And he had a bunch of women in there, was supposed to be his queens, that was prophetess. They even think that old Balaam come from that section, they had roots and so forth. They worshipped, you know (many of you scholars that reading Hislop's Two Babylons, and so forth, and the history of the church), and how they--they did. And they had women that done this, and women... a goddess, and everything, and it was a forced religion. Everybody, every city around Babylon was compelled to come to Babylon to worship under Nimrod at the tower. See? That's right. They were forced to do it, debate it. There's where the confusion come. [Genesis 10:8-10]\n\nL-184 And that's exactly what the church is today, \"If you don't attend Sunday school, if you don't do this, and have to hire you to do this and do this and do that, you're out of the picture.\"\n\nL-185 Out there in Tucson, is listening in this morning, I once wondered... I've always constraining people, \"Go to church, no matter where you go.\" And I seen the people kind of pulling back, and going this way. And I thought, \"What's the matter?\"\n\nL-186 I went to some of them, \"The first day you're there, they'll approach you, 'Join our church.' If you don't do it, you're not welcome.\" See? See? It's a forced thing, it's forced upon you, see, and that's Babylon. But in Christ, you come in by election; not by force, your heart pulls you in.\n\nL-187 God did not put His name then in Babylon. Closely now. He cannot put His Name in Babylon, the churches. Oh, they, they put His Name in there, but He never. No.\n\nL-188 You say, \"Well, now, Brother Branham!\" Wait, wait, just sit still just a minute. You asked me to stay a little longer. All right. Now notice, they put His Name in there, but He didn't.\n\nL-189 Now, He said, \"The place that I'm going to meet you and receive your sacrifice is where I choose to put My Name. You come in at this gate, this door where I choose to put My Name. There's where you come.\" [Deuteronomy 16:6]\n\nL-190 Well, they put, \"This is the Church of Christ.\" If there's anything that's wrong in that declaration, it left out one word: \"anti.\" Uh-huh, all that He taught, they disagree with It. Modern Pharisees.\n\nL-191 But we must find where He did put His Name, for in It is His only provided gate. Amen! Glory! Watch! Where did He put His Name? In His Son.\n\nL-192 \"Oh,\" you say, \"now wait a minute, Brother Branham. That was the Son, not the Father.\"\n\nL-193 The son always takes the name of his father in every case. I come to this earth in the name of a Branham because my father's name was Branham.\n\nL-194 Jesus said, \"I came in My Father's Name, and you received Me not.\" You want the Scripture on that? St. John 5:43. See? \"I--I came in My Father's Name, and you received Me not.\" Then the Father put His Own Name, which is \"Jesus,\" in the Son. And He's the way, He's the door, He's the house, He's where God chose to put His Name. God never put His Name in me, He never put It in the church, He never put It in the Methodist, Baptist, Catholic, but He put It in Christ the Anointed Emmanuel. [John 5:43]\n\nL-195 And the Name is in the Word because He is the Word. Amen! What is He then? The Word interpreted is the manifestation of the Name of God. No wonder. \"Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father which is in Heaven has revealed this to you, Who I am. And upon this rock I'll build My place of worship, and the gates of hell can't shake It down.\" Amen! O living Church of God, stand in firm foundation on Jesus Christ alone. You can sing the song, but if you're not on Christ the Word, you're on teetering, faltering sand. \"But upon this rock,\" Christ, \"My Word.\" [John 1:14], [Matthew 16:17]\n\nL-196 He built the Lutheran message and they denominated it. It was growing, the footstool. Then He growed up into the leg part, the Methodist, and so forth. There's where He built His Church, upon His Word! Now, He's not all foot or all thigh, He's a body; and now is the capping part. Did you notice in the pyramids? Which, I don't preach a pyramid religion, now. 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min\n\nL-197 But the first Bible was ever wrote, was wrote in the sky, the zo-... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Did you notice it? It starts off with the virgin, the first figure in the, zodiac. The last figure is Leo the lion. He come first by the virgin, He comes next as the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Just before that, a cancer age, a cross fish, all the rest the ages. If we had time to go through it; which we have, at the tabernacle.\n\nL-198 And the pyra-... pyramid being those foundations, up into the king's chamber. And just before you hit the seventh wall, there's a little introduction plank there, where a messenger comes out to bring you to the king. (The messenger John the Baptist that introduced to the King), but the Headstone was rejected. And they don't know, the Stone of Scone, or whatever it is, they don't know where it's at, because it's a rejected stone. But that's the stone that caps the whole thing, that makes it the pyramid through the complete seven church ages. Add grace, add this, add this, there's seven adds, the last one is Christ. Add this to your charity, add grace to your grace, add something else, and something else, till it gets up to Christ is the Headstone, \"And I am the door.\" [John 10:9], [II Peter 1:5-7]\n\nL-199 Now, a son always comes in his father's name. Any son comes in his father's name. And Jesus said, \"I came in My Father's Name.\" Then what is the Name of the Father? What is the Name of the Son? And He said, \"A little while and the world seeth Me no more, yet ye shall see Me.\" Yeah, He's come in the form of the Holy Ghost, that same Jesus. That was the reason they was worshipping, \"O Jesus!\" See? See? Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: It's the Lord Jesus, Christ. That's all. \"I come in My Father's Name, and you received Me not.\" [John 14:19], [John 5:43]\n\nL-200 Now, remember, He also added here and warns us, \"another will come,\" a denomination, a creed. \"They'll come in their name and you will receive them. You won't receive Me, the Word vindicated and proved before you.\"\n\nL-201 As He was right then, so is He today. Don't you miss that, people across this nation! \"Another will come, a church, and you'll believe that, because you can just do any way. I won't vindicate it.\" He's never (at any time, ever) vindicated anything (in any church) outside of the Message that was given: Luther's, justification; Wesley, sanctification; Pentecostal, restoration of the gifts. After... And as soon as they make a denomination out of it, there it died. Search the Scriptures.\n\nL-202 But He said, \"I'll choose the place to put My Name.\" And the Name was Jesus. And Jesus is the Word, St. John 1. Is that right? That's the place of worship, in Christ the Word. \"I come in My Father's Name.\" [John 1:1-2, 14], [John 5:43]\n\nL-203 The prophet said, \"His Name shall be called Emmanuel.\" That's Matthew 1:23, if you want to... wrote it... that down. Jesus, Jehovah, the Saviour. [Matthew 1:23]\n\nL-204 Now, the 5th verse shows that He is the door. By now, many other invisible proofs, this gate, and Name, and place can be proved to be there's only one place that God meets man to worship, and that's when he's in Christ. [Deuteronomy 16:5]\n\nL-205 Now, now the question is, \"How do we get in Him?\" Now, this may pinch just a little bit; but, you know, like taking medicine, if it don't make, you sick, it don't do you no good. See?\n\nL-206 Now, the Lutherans wanted to get in one way, by joining the Lutheran church. The Methodist wanted to get in by shouting. The Pentecostals wanted to, get in by speaking in tongues. That still ain't it! See? No, that's gifts, so forth. But I Corinthians 12 says, \"By one Spirit.\" Spirit of God, which is the Life-giver to the Word (the Seed), to vindicate that Seed for that season. See? [I Corinthians 12:13]\n\nL-207 Here's the Methodist-age seed laying there, it taken the Holy Spirit to make that seed come to life and pure... purify the church by sanctification; Luther didn't preach that, 'cause he didn't know it. The Pentecostals wanted to speak in tongues for the restoration of the gifts. Each one declares, \"That's It! That's It!\" See?\n\nL-208 \"But by one Spirit we're all baptized into one Body,\" and that Body is a family, the family of God. And that's the house of God, and the house of God is the Name of Jesus Christ. \"The Name of the Lord is a mighty tower, the righteous run into It and are safe.\" [Proverbs 18:10], [I Corinthians 12:13], [Ephesians 2:18]\n\nL-209 Now, how you going to come in by a title? How's your check going to be received by saying, \"Paid to the order of--of Reverend, Doctor, Minister\"? See? See? You might be a reverend, doctor, minister. But the name of the Lord is 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min \"Jesus Christ.\" See? [Philippians 2:10]\n\nL-210 \"I have chose to put My Name at the door of the house of My worship, for My family will be gathered in there under the Blood; like it was in Egypt, anything outside died. And in there there's no leavened bread! There's no denominational mixture in It anywhere, My house! My children, borned of My genes!\" Amen! Glory to God! \"My genes are in them! My... I put My Word in them. I'll write them upon the tables of their heart. That's My family, the family of the Body of Jesus Christ; the family. And this door you'll come in, not Methodist, Baptist, or Pentecostal, but in the door where I put My Name.\" It ain't Methodist. God's Name ain't Methodist. God's Name ain't Pentecostal. God's Name ain't Baptist. God's Name ain't Catholic. Stay out of the doors then. See? See? See? [Hebrews 8:10]\n\nL-211 \"But in a place where I choose to put My Name.\" Now, there's not another place in the Bible given where that God ever put His Name, only in Jesus Christ, for He is the Son of God taking the Name of God, and God's human Name. \"And there's not another name given under Heaven whereby you must be saved.\" I don't care, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, catechisms, or whatever you want to do; only through the Name of Jesus Christ where every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess to it, Him being Lord. There's how you come in. [Acts 4:12], [Philippians 2:11]\n\nL-212 And if you was just baptized in water right--right, and then deny the Word, then you're illegitimate; your birth wasn't correct. You claim that you believed Him then, and you deny Him. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-213 How could I deny my family? When... How could I deny Charles Branham being my father? A blood test on the door shows it. Uh-huh.\n\nL-214 My action, and the vindication of God's Word in my life shows whether I'm a child of God or not. Now, there's God's only place. See it? The only place that God will receive your sacrifice (I don't care how sincere you are) is in Christ.\n\nL-215 And remember... You say, \"Well, I believed I come in too.\" Remember, the Bible says... You say, \"Well, the Bible said, 'Whosoever believeth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, is saved, shall be saved.\"' [John 3:16-18]\n\nL-216 It says that, but remember it also is written, also is written, \"No man can call Jesus the Christ, only by the Holy Ghost.\" See? You might say \"he is,\" but he isn't until the Holy Spirit Itself which gives Life to the Word proves it by vindication that you are the son of God. That's the Scripture. [I Corinthians 12:3]\n\nL-217 \"The place that I chose to put My Name. You shall not worship in any other gate, but in the gate I put My Name in; then I will receive you, you're in My family.\" [Deuteronomy 16:5-6]\n\nL-218 Now, the family of God obeys, the order of the Father of the family. \"And He is the Prince of Peace, the Mighty God, the everlasting Father; and of His dominion and reign there shall be no end, the government shall be upon His shoulder.\" And Him being Governor, King, Emmanuel, First, Last, Prince of Peace, the Mighty God, everlasting Father, every one of His children obey every Word to the order because they're a part of Him. [Isaiah 9:6]\n\nL-219 We live in our home like Branhams live. You live in your home, the Joneses, like the Joneses live.\n\nL-220 And in the House of God we live by the Word of God and every One that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; and any other, fraud, we won't listen to him. See? \"You shall eat unleavened bread, every church age, just as I give It to you.\" But don't try to go back and inject that over into This, because it's come into a stalk. \"You shall take the bones and things that's left over of the sacrifice and burn them!\" Gone, the church age died, went on; we're in another one now. Amen! [Deuteronomy 16:8]\n\nL-221 \"The place I choose to put My Name in.\" Oh, my! First Corinthians 12.\n\nL-222 Notice Ephesians 4:30. ... grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until the... (next revival?)... until the day of your redemption. ... grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption. [Ephesians 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min 4:30]\n\nL-223 Now notice. Let's apply that to our Scripture lesson. Then we better go, I think I'm wearing the people out. Don't you? People getting up and going home, see, 'cause they got--they got dinner cooking. And somebody else wanting to leave, they didn't expect come down here to listen all day long. See? But look, you know the...\n\nL-224 Ben, I--I ought to work on you! Bless you! Thank you, Brother Ben. I love you, Brother Ben.\n\nL-225 If you know what that boy's suffered for us in that war; he's shot all to pieces, and blowed up, and everything else. He's had a life of everything, but God's blessed him. He stayed true. His wife left him, run away and married again, and took his children. Oh, my, I just can't think about it. But, anyhow, God bless you, Ben.\n\nL-226 He's laying right now full of shrapnel, pressing against his nerves and everything else. Just... You have to know the background of Ben, you see. God, bless that boy. Yes. ... whereby you're sealed until the day of your redemption.\n\nL-227 Notice! Now this might pinch just a little bit, but notice. Don't fall out with me. Just remember.\n\nL-228 When Israel once looked on that door, with that blood on the door, the name (the blood, the life), and entered in under that blood, they never went out again until they went out of Egypt. ... grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you go in and don't go out anymore until the day that you are redeemed out. (See?) [Ephesians 4:30]\n\nL-229 You know, the Bible is always right. He puts Words in There, you've got to place It out where It goes, to make It, make the whole picture of redemption. See? See? ... grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until your redemption. (Till you're redeemed.) [Ephesians 4:30]\n\nL-230 You're sealed in there, you're beneath the Blood. You don't go out no more. And then what are you? God's son in God's family, sealed in by the Holy Spirit. The Devil couldn't get you if he had to; for you are dead, your old husband part is dead; and you are buried, and your life is hid in God through Christ, and sealed by the Holy Ghost. How's he going to get you? How you going to get out? You're there! Glory! Now I'll leave that alone; just enough so you'll know what I'm talking about. [Colossians 3:3], [Ephesians 4:30]\n\nL-231 Then a new creation, not to a denomination but to the Word. You're a creation of the Word. Because the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world, predestinated to be sons and daughters of God. [II Corinthians 5:17]\n\nL-232 And upon this come stone upon stone, in each age, to vindicate that Word that's coming up, just exactly as Jesus did in His age, which is, the Capstone of it all. In Him laid every age. In Jesus was Moses. In Jesus was David. In Jesus was the prophets. Is that right? Look at Joseph, sold for almost thirty pieces of silver, throwed in, supposed to be dead, taken out, went and come to the right hand of Pharaoh. Look, exactly, Jesus was... Joseph was in Jesus.\n\nL-233 And when He come, He was the fulness of the kings, prophets (hallelujah), the godhead bodily rested in Him. He come to redeem out of there a Bride, a Masterpiece. A Masterpiece that says to Satan that...\n\nL-234 When he says, \"Days of miracles is past. There's no such a thing as these things you're talking about.\" [Matthew 4:10]\n\nL-235 \"Get thee behind me, Satan.\" See? See, a Masterpiece standing and a guarding. [Matthew 15:14]\n\nL-236 Sometime the Capstone will return, the head of all of it, and receive the Bride unto Himself; which the woman is took from the man, a part of the man. Every... Genes of the man is in the woman, what makes the woman. And that's the way the Word of God is in the Church, what makes the Church the Bride. Not a denomination, that's of the Devil, every one of them. I ain't calling the people in there that; they are poor deceived people, like Jesus said, \"Blind leading the blind.\" And He could not call them out. [Matthew 15:14]\n\nL-237 And they said, \"Why, you are borned of fornication! Who tells you to come to here? What school, what seminary 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min recognized you? There we have Moses. We are...\" [John 5:46]\n\nL-238 He said, \"If you'd a-knowed Moses, you'd a-knowed Me.\"\n\nL-239 Cause Moses wrote Him in his four books, \"The Lord your God shall raise up a giver of the Word, a Prophet likened unto me, and who will not hear that prophet will be cut off from amongst the people.\" That's all there is to it. And what is He? The Word. And what is It? Don't leave none of the leaven left in the... Just don't put no leaven amongst It. Don't add any creed, any denomination, for it's polluted right there, your sacrifice is finished. [Deuteronomy 18:15]\n\nL-240 Let's hurry now, right quick, so you can go eat.\n\nL-241 Notice! Now, then, you are a son of God in the house of God, you are a part of God's economy. Romans 8: 1, \"Then there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.\" For they are dead to the world, alive in Him, and living in this present day, making the Word that God has used them for, foreordained them, placing their names in this Bride Book. And when the Waters comes upon that seed that's in the heart, raises it up to the Bride of Christ. Oh, my! Just perfect as it can be. In every age it's been that way. [Romans 8:1]\n\nL-242 The Lutherans, under justification, the feet, raised it like that; Wesley, under sanctification. The Pentecostals under the arms, the works and deeds and so forth, had to be Calvinists... or had to be Arminian, had to be legalists. But now we come to the head, the capstone. \"Grace! Grace!\" the capstone cried. [Zechariah 4:7]\n\nL-243 The headstone crying what? \"Grace! Grace!\" Passed from death and creed, into a living Word of the living God. God's only provided plan for His age, His sons in the Word age quickened by the Spirit like a spark that's lit off of something to make it alive; and seated now in heavenly places (in present tense), already alive and subject to every promise in the Word. Then what does that do? You being a part of God's gene, a part of the Word, other men a part of God's Word, seated together, manifest the entire Body of Christ, because there's no leaven among you. (See what He's talking about, Brother Brown?) No leaven among you, just the Word only, seated in heavenly places, in the door where He put His Name: Christ Jesus. [Zechariah 4:7], [Ephesians 2:1, 5]\n\nL-244 No leaven among you, that brings the entire fulness of the godhead bodily among you. Couldn't do it in Luther's age, couldn't do it in Wesley's age, couldn't do it in Pentecostal age; but in the day when the Son of man will be manifested, revealed, brought back the Church together with the entire Deity of God amongst His people, showing the same visible signs, manifesting Himself like He did at the beginning when He was manifested on earth in a form of a Prophet-God. Oh! Glory! Promised by Malachi 4, promised by the rest of the Scriptures. Where you worship at? The house of God, seated (in present tense). [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-245 Now, quickly, let us look just real fast now, and we'll go in about... in ten minutes we'll be gone, the Lord willing.\n\nL-246 Now let us look at some that has been quickened into this house of God, of their age.\n\nL-247 Enoch! (In ten minutes we'll go, if you can just suffer that much longer.) Look, Enoch was the living Word of God of his age, he was, a prophet.\n\nL-248 A prophet is God's reflector. How many knows that? The--the reflector doesn't reflect itself, the--the reflector isn't the reflection. There has to be something strike the reflector--reflector to make it reflect. So a prophet is a chosen vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing at all but he's in direct line with that reflection, God, to reflect the image of Christ the Word. See, nothing else can do it. You are a reflector, that's the reason the prophet had to eat the book. That's the reason he had to eat the scroll. He had to reflect that Word for that age. You got it? [Revelation 10:8-10]\n\nL-249 Notice Enoch, God's perfect reflector in type. When God was through--through with him, He just translated him, took him up. The mechanics that he had reflected become dynamics with the Spirit, and took him up. [Genesis 5:24]\n\nL-250 Same in the days of Elijah. Elijah, even to his bones, where that reflection... Reflector of God in his body being made manifest the Word of God. They laid a dead man on it, he sparked to life again. We are flesh and bone of Him, as long as we are the Bride of Christ. Do you believe that? All right. He died for us, and we died to ourselves and are buried in His Name, that we would \"no more be of the world, but in Him,\" of which both the family in Heaven is 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min named after Jesus Christ. That's Ephesians 1:21. For both Heaven... the family in Heaven. What's the family in Heaven named? Jesus. What's the family on earth named? Well, that's the house of God where the Blood's at. Is that right? That's the door, that's the gate, that's the place He put His Name, and the Word was made flesh and dwelled among us. It's the Word reflecting and sparking off the age that you're living in. That's what He was, that's what Moses was, that's what Jacob was, that's what the rest of them was, sparking off that Word of God, the reflector that God was reflecting Himself. And come to that perfect image of God, Jesus Christ, God's Masterpiece; was struck that He might take the rest of them for a Bride that's been reflecting Him. [II Kings 13:21], [Romans 6:3-4]\n\nL-251 Moses was in Him. Joshua was in Him. And if you are in Him, you was in Him before the foundation of the world, the family of God; you suffered with Him, you died with Him, you went to the cross with Him, you raised with Him; and now you're still with Him, setting in Heavenly places, reflecting the Message of the age to the world, the Light of the world. \"Ye are the Light of the world,\" but if it's hid by a denominational bushel basket, how are, they going to see It? For your traditions, you make the Light of no effect! By trying... You denominationals, trying to keep the Light away from your church; you won't go in, neither will you let them. Amen. [Ephesians 1:4], [Matthew 5:14]\n\nL-252 Let's just stop. My, I got too much here. We--we could go on... Oh, my! Five minutes we got.\n\nL-253 You see who the door is? Where did God put His Name? In Jesus. How do you get in His Name? How do you get in there? By being baptized in there! How? By water? By Spirit! \"One Lord, one faith, one baptism.\" That's Holy Ghost baptism. [Ephesians 4:5]\n\nL-254 The water baptism just put you in fellowship with the people, that you recognized that you have accepted Christ. That's the Truth. But it's Spirit baptism. I can call the Name of Jesus over you and baptize you, that doesn't make it so.\n\nL-255 But when once that Holy Spirit really... genuine Word comes into you (the Word, Jesus), then, brother, the Message is no secret to you then; you know It, brother, It's all lit up before you. Hallelujah! Praise be to God! Amen! I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me, And purchased my salva-... Dear God, I pray that You will heal these people, Lord, and make each one of them well. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-256 Oh! Love! Oh! E'er since, by faith I saw that stream Thy flowing wounds supplied, (from that Masterpiece) Redeeming love has been my theme,\n\nL-257 How can you... God is Love. \"He that loveth is of God,\" divine, holy love, not dirty love; clean, pure, holy love, love of God the Word. \"Thy laws have I hid in my heart, that I sin not against Thee,\" oh, my, that David crying out. Isn't He wonderful? Don't you love Him? [I John 4:7], [Psalms 119:11]\n\nL-258 Now, there is a Way, a pure, holy Way, a only meeting place that God will meet you. Not because you say, \"God, now, I'm a good Methodist. I'm a good Baptist. I'm a good Pentecostal.\" No! Because that you are in Jesus the Word, the part of the Word that's being manifested to today, this day's Message; not Luther's, Wesley's, Pentecostal; but your Jesus, the reflection, that has come up into this. You can't go back to that, that's adding leaven to your holy Bread, that, \"Man shall live by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, in Its season.\" [Matthew 4:4]\n\nL-259 O come, Lord Jesus, the great, Headstone. Look laying yonder, the dust of them Lutherans that died back yonder under martyrdom; look at them Methodist.\n\nL-260 Those Pentecostals and so forth, coming up now, that real strain that come out.\n\nL-261 You Assemblies of God went and organized, when the very thing God brought you out of, you turned right back like a hog to its wallow. [II Peter 2:22]\n\nL-262 You Oneness united, the old J.C. of... Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ. One for the colored, and separated 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min yourselves because of segregation. You that did that, and then united yourself and call it \"United.\" And then organized, and fussed at the Assemblies: \"As a dog turns to its vomit.\" If the vomit made the dog sick in the first place, won't it make him sick again? Change your diet from your denomination to the Word, and live with Christ. Shame on you! I've got a Father over yonder, I've got a Father over yonder, I've got a Father over yonder, On the other shore. Some bright day I'll go and see Him, Some bright day... go and see Him, Some bright day I'll go and see Him, On the other shore. Oh, won't that be a happy meeting, Won't that... (Word goes to Word!) meeting, (When the Bride goes up, Word by Word.)... happy meeting, On the other shore. Oh, that bright day may be tomorrow, That bright day may be tomorrow, That bright day may be tomorrow, On the other shore.\n\nL-263 You say, \"You mean that, Brother Branham?\"\n\nL-264 Yes, sir! When the Lutheran of the age, the Wesley's of their age, the pentecostals of their age (the true ones, not the denominationals); the Pentecostals, the one that added leaven (their denomination), died. But this true Word moving on, see. Just like Jesus said, \"At that day, you will. know that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me, and I in you and you in Me.\" It's all the Word! Oh, won't that be a happy meet-... (when His sons gather to His gate) ... happy meeting, Won't that be a happy meeting, On the other shore. [John 14:20]\n\nL-265 Now, church, we're teaching now. But, remember, when you leave here, start moving out of the shuck now; you're going into the grain, but lay in the Presence of the Son. Don't add to what I've said, don't take away what I've said. Because, I speak the Truth as far as I know It, as the Father has given to me. See? Don't add to It, just say what I said.\n\nL-266 The thing of it is, just tell the people to come seek the Lord Jesus. And then you yourself lay right in His Presence, just make love to Him, \"O Lord Jesus, Son of God, I love You. Tender my heart, Lord. Take away all the filth and the love of the world, and let me live holy in this present world before You.\"\n\nL-267 Shall we bow our heads for prayer. Now, let's see, have you got anybody chosen to dismiss in prayer? Or, I will, then. Be real reverent.\n\nL-268 Dear God, we thank You that we have had our spiritual diet. We thank You, Lord, that the vitamin of the Word grows sons of God. It does not affect on any other type of character, only on sons and daughters of God. So we thank You for It. And we pray, God, that we will profit therewith, that we will not only thank Thee. We thank You for It, but may we use the strength to try to (by Love) persuade people to believe in our God; the wayward, the sinners, the women, the man, the boys, the, girls, in this age.\n\nL-269 Seeing, Lord, that the mental condition, the nervous age that the people's living in, it's driving them out of their mind; to exactly fulfill what the Scripture said and promised, the great hideous things would come upon the earth; like locusts, to haunt the women that cut their hair, they'll have long hair like a woman. And different hideous sights that they'll be able to see, Lord, in that mental, diluted conditions they're in, and then screaming for the rocks and the 65-1128M, God's Only Provided Place Of Worship, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 124 min mountains. Women who would mother dogs and cats, and not raise children to honor You. Those that You did give children to and they did conceive them, turn them loose on the streets to do as they want. No wonder You said, Lord, when You were going to the cross, \"Then they'll begin to cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on them.\" [Revelation 6:16]\n\nL-270 We see every other thing moving right up to this time. We see the Scripture being vindicated, proved. And just as we see That, Lord, You with our own eyes (being made, manifest), some day there will be a Rapture and we'll see the manifestation of that Word, \"For the Son of man shall come in the clouds of glory, with His holy angels with Him, and we'll be caught up to meet Him in the air.\" It will then be... We hear of it now, then we'll see it with our own eye. [Matthew 24:30], [I Thessalonians 4:17], [Matthew 25:31]\n\nL-271 May we be found in Him, Lord, the only provided place. And He is the sacrifice. We bring Him, what we've heard about, Jesus Christ, into the house of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, through the Name of Jesus Christ. And there our sacrifice is accepted and we're brought into the family; because, yet straying out in the world, we were ordained sons and daughters of God before the foundation of the world. Thank You for that, Father. Oh, how could anyone ever turn back on something like that, when they found the Truth, that God had selected them out of the world? There were millions lost, the day that I was saved.\n\nL-272 O dying Lamb, how can I ever thank You? How can my heart ever be reverent enough before. You? Help me, dear God, to live true. Help my people to live true. I pray for them, Lord, every one, that You will... God, somehow, I don't... I--I wouldn't know how... I don't know how, just how to ask, Lord; and I may of not even asking that in the right manner. But You forgive my ignorance, Lord, and just look at my heart. I pray that not one of them will be lost, not one of them, Father. I claim them, every one, for You. In the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. I love Him, I... And if you love Him, you love one another. Shake one another's hand. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O. Box 4951 Naperville, IL 60567 USA Email: thevoice1017@lwbcast.org http://www.lwbcast.org/ The Rapture"}, {"id": "65-1204 - The Rapture.txt", "text": "L-1 The chapter here at--at Yuma, it's a grand privilege to have this invitation to come back again. We had a wonderful time, the last time here. And then when I understood I was to be back again, it made me feel real good, to hear the testimonies and these fine words from the people, and kind of boosts you up a little.\n\nL-2 Billy told me that the brother from Las Vegas, that wanted a meeting there at the chapter, see him immediately after the service is over here. We have a time, he says, that we can slip in, right over in January, before the Phoenix meeting, see, to come to Las Vegas. And so we've always wanted to get there. I believe Brother Art Wilson used to be there, a long time ago, or he may still be there. And he--he asked me come up, he and Sister Wilson. I didn't get the opportunity, so maybe this will be the time I could come.\n\nL-3 You just see Billy Paul or Brother Roy Borders. I think he's here somewhere. Somebody said Brother Roy was in. Brother Pearry, Lee, or any of them, they'll be able to tell you. Just set the dates for us to come.\n\nL-4 Now, I seen many ministers here, a while ago, to which I'm very happy to meet my brethren. Wish I had time, go home with you, 'cause I know you got the best cook there is in the country. That's fine.\n\nL-5 And now, Brother Pearry really got two, tonight, on him. He got two marks against him now. One of them, cutting that microphone in, out there. When, you're--you're held guilty of that, Brother Pearry. I don't think you really were guilty. But you... Somebody was fixing to speak. That was a good one.\n\nL-6 And so then, again, he went out there and was talking. He said, \"Say!\" Telling Brother Collins or some of them. Said, \"The supper was good. But,\" said, \"I'm telling you,\" said, \"that man must be a Spaniard or something, or a Mexican. That was the hottest pepper I ever taste.\" Going on like that, and he was talking to the chef. He said, \"I'm the chef.\"\n\nL-7 That's Texas, for you. We'll get him straightened out, over here in Arizona, after while, (won't we?), if he stay around us.\n\nL-8 Really nice to be here! And I guess those don't sound like jokes, but sense of humor. Which, the Lord Hisself had a sense of humor, you know. He said, \"'Herod,' go tell that fox, see, 'today I cast out--cast out devils; tomorrow I'm made perfect.'\" So, He had a sense of humor. Well, it won't hurt us, I don't think, once in a while. [Luke 13:32]\n\nL-9 And now it's a little late. And, usually, I--I preach about four hours. So this, knowing the courtesy of the brother and sister here, the chapter, we'll cut that way down, tonight. And just... I told Terry. I said... He said, \"What's... Put on a two-hour tape?\" I said, \"No, Terry. This is a--a banquet.\" I said, \"Just about thirty or forty minutes, speak to the people of something.\" That, I'd try, though, each time, knowing that.\n\nL-10 When I was a little boy, people used to come out to listen because I was a boy preacher, just a young fellow, a chap. And they'd say, \"Well, Billy Branham, you know, just a kid, never went through school, and no education.\" And they'd come out to hear my broken words, my Kentucky English, and--and so they... my \"hits, and hain'ts, and totes, and carry.\" Like in one of the meetings here not long ago, they said, \"We'll all stand up and sing the nation anthem.\"\n\nL-11 I got up and said, \"For my old Kentucky home far away.\" That was the only nation I knowed about, so it was national anthem, as far as I was concerned.\n\nL-12 So now, after you got older, though, well, we, he come in, you got to have something more than that. See? We're take... Paul said, \"When I was a child, I spake as a child and thought as a child. You act as a child.\" But as you grow older, then you begin, from making your first couple steps, and tottle and fall, and get up and try it again. Then you, after while, you get so you can walk a straight line. And that's what we have to do, as soldiers of the cross. Now is time 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min to walk a straight line, right down that high way to Glory. [I Corinthians 13:11], [II Timothy 2:3]\n\nL-13 I do believe that we are living in the closing scenes of the history of this world. I truly believe that the Coming of the Lord is closer, perhaps, than we think. So now, for just about thirty minutes of your time, or something, I would like to call your attention to a Scripture that I'd like to use for a text, and--and refer to some more here. Setting at home, the other day, I was thinking on this thought. Then I thought, \"Well, I don't know, speaking from all this Scripture. I'll just take part of It, and just for those little short services like we would have tonight.\" I want to say one thing, while you're turning over to Psalms. The--the first... The 27th Psalm, I want first five verses, to read. [James 5:8], [Psalms 27:1-5]\n\nL-14 Would like to say this, concerning this businessmen's Full Gospel Business Men's chapters. My Brother Pearry was speaking about the books, and so forth, and the new books that they got. How many remembers when we had the tape, and preached it over here at Phoenix, at one of the conventions, of Sirs, What Time Is It? Now, that was the beginning of that book, you see, when this--this taken place.\n\nL-15 There's too much supernatural vindication of God's written Word, of this hour, for something not to be approaching us now. We're just... It's too real. The things that you... It would be astounding, to you, just to let you know that what is really taking place. Many of you, strangers, perhaps, hear these men get up and make--make these remarks, about, \"A Message of this hour,\" and so forth. What they are getting at, is God's promise of this hour, that He promised what He would do. And we see Him Scripturally vindicating just exactly what He said He would do, in the same manner. Foretold, hits just exactly perfectly, each time, because it's God saying it.\n\nL-16 If a man, I don't care who he was, will try to make such a prediction, there's one chance out of ten million. If a man told you a certain thing would happen, it would--it would happen at a certain time; one out of ten million. And then the place it would happen, would be about one chance out of about a hundred million. And then the time it would happen, goes on and on, and the way it will happen, and what it will be happening, and so forth, it's just beyond a guess. When we see it so perfectly, each and every time, then it's God. And then we turn right back in the Scriptures. It may seem foreign to us. But we turn right back in the Scriptures, without even knowing where to look, and the Holy Spirit brings out and just puts the whole Word together, makes the picture there to show us just the hour that we're living in. We're changing dispensations.\n\nL-17 We're--we're at a corner. It's easy when somebody turns a corner, of a brick mason, turns a corner. Starts, everybody laying their bricks right down the same row, like a certain denomination starts, and starts rolling down the row, it's all right. But, when you get to them turns, where you have to turn back the other way! Now, God isn't building a wall. He's building a house, see, and there's many cuts and turns that He's predicted here in the Bible. And the turns, anybody could try to make a turn, but it must be according to the blueprint. If it isn't, it's got to be torn down again.\n\nL-18 So we--we praise God for His goodness and the fellowship of you people, and the open doors that the Lord has given us, and through this businessmen. I've always contended that I--I didn't believe in... I believe in the people in denominations. But I don't have much time to exhort denominations, because each one builds a fence around himself.\n\nL-19 And--and just like, I believe, it was Brother David's little saying, about he was raising some ducks, and said the river come up. And each duck, you know, they wanted fellowship with one another, and they couldn't do it because they was all fenced up. But when the water got so high, it just floated the ducks out of the pen. So I--I think that's the way to do it. Is just the water is coming up, see, and we can get out of the pen and--and fellowship with one another, you know, have the real love of Christ in our hearts.\n\nL-20 And this Full Gospel Business Men has been an--an oasis for me. Because, many times... I have brothers, fine brothers in, I guess, every denomination I've ever met: Presbyterians, Lutheran, Baptists, Pentecostals, all different types of the Pentecostals, church of God, and Nazarenes, Pilgrim Holiness. Fine brethren, everywhere. But, many times, they cannot have me in their community, because, see, not that they don't believe it, but, see, it would cut them off from their denomination. And when you do that, course, that--that does it. 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min\n\nL-21 Here not long ago, there was a Methodist brother came to me, I won't call his name. A fine man, he was writing a thesis on Divine healing, and he come to me for some--some talk. We set down and talked a little while. He said, \"The only thing we got against you, you're hanging around them Pentecostals all the time.\" I said, \"Then, let the Methodist church sponsor it. I'll come.\" That was different. See? He--he said, \"Well, of course, I--I'm not the Methodist church. I just belong with them.\"\n\nL-22 I said, \"That's it. See? They're the ones, the Pentecostals, is the ones that open their doors. See? That's the ones I can get to. And as many as them that will open, why, we're ready to come in.\" Like in the Revelations, the 3rd chapter, said, \"I stand at the door and knock. If any man will open the door, I'll come in and sup.\" And that was Jesus. All of us knows that was Christ, and He is the Word. That's right. He is the Word. [Revelation 3:20]\n\nL-23 And so the Full Gospel Business Men has been a oasis where we can come together. No churches is sponsoring it. They all, together, the--the men out of the churches, and we come together and fellowship, cross the world, around everywhere.\n\nL-24 And I've helped establish many, many, many chapters throughout the entire world, of the Full Gospel Business Men. I'm thankful for that opportunity that was given me. In there, the businessmen will sponsor it. Then, all the churches, they--they want to come, anyhow. But then I don't want to never try to pull somebody from their church. Just stay right in your church and scatter out the Light. See? Be a real Christian. Your pastor will appreciate you. A real, loyal, genuine saint, any man that believes in God will appreciate a person like that. Yes.\n\nL-25 Now, I thank the brother here, and his wife, and this chapter, for this opportunity. And may this chapter grow. May the blessings of God rest upon it, and be an instrument in God's hands, to save hundreds and hundreds of people before the Coming of the Lord; and all the rest of you chapters or representatives here from the chapters.\n\nL-26 In the Book of Psalms, now, I want to speak on a--a real strange subject, tonight, just for a little while. I got some Scriptures written down here. And--and I thought maybe that, tonight, I was going to speak on something different. But, see the time get away, why, I didn't want to stay that long, so I just turned over here and got some more Scripture. And I want to speak on the subject of: The Rapture. See?\n\nL-27 Now, we believe that there will be a Rapture. All Christians believe that, that's Bible readers, believes that there will be a Rapture. [I Thessalonians 4:15-18], [Matthew 24:40], [Luke 17:36]\n\nL-28 And now to read for some background, we read the 25th Psalm. I mean... I beg your pardon. The 27th Psalm, 1 to 5 verses. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, come upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumble and fell. Though the host should encamp about me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this I will be confident. One thing have I desired of the LORD, that I will seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to require in his temple. For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in the pavilion: and in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up on a rock. May the Lord add His blessings to that reading of His Word. [Psalms 27:1-5]\n\nL-29 Now, today, speaking on this subject, and now some of you may different, the--the avenues that I take. But how many in here believes that the Bible teaches there will a Rapture of the Church? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Yes, sir. That's right, exactly, a catching away of the Church. Whether you're a Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, or whoever you are, Pentecostal, there will be a catching away. [I Thessalonians 4:16-17], [Luke 17:36], [Matthew 24:40]\n\nL-30 And I think that, in speaking, I--I just don't try to get up here to say something that I think would please the people. 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min I've never been guilty of that. I want to get up here and say something as I feel led to say it, that I think would be a help to you, something that would further your experience with God, if you are a Christian; and if you're not a Christian, make you so ashamed of yourself, that you will become a Christian. And that's the purpose that I've always tried to line up my thoughts, as the Lord would lead me.\n\nL-31 Now, we are warned, as in the Doctrine of This in the last days will be scorned at. If you would, let's just read That, just a minute. It's in Second Peter, the 3rd chapter. Let's read just a moment on this. The 3rd chapter, and the 3rd and 4th verses. Let's see if this isn't right. Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, And saying, Where is the promise of his coming?... since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of that, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and the wa-... and in the water: Whereby the worlds that... was, being overflowed with water, perished: [II Peter 3:3-4]\n\nL-32 Now we see that, the reason that this subject is so lightened at, is because that the prophet here has said that in this last days these scoffers would come saying these things. See? It's predicted, the reason the people are acting today the way they're acting. Why, you certainly are expecting it, because the Bible said that. \"In the last days they'd be heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God; trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, despisers of those that are good; having a form of godliness, and denying the power thereof: from such turn away.\" Can we look for an impersonation of Truth? Certainly. [II Peter 3:3-4], [II Timothy 3:1, 2-5]\n\nL-33 When Moses went down into Egypt, to deliver the children of Israel, with only a stick in his hand for vindication, with the God of Heaven behind him, he performed a miracle. There come impersonators behind him, and doing the same thing he did. See? Now, they come second, after he did it first. Then they come around, because they were copying after what he did, impersonating the original. We find that. And now you say, \"Well, that was in the days of Moses.\" But the same Scripture says that they'll come again in the last days. \"A Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so will these men of reprobate mind concerning Truth.\" See? Impersonations, all kinds of things to upset people. And then if... [Exodus 7:10-12], [II Timothy 3:8]\n\nL-34 This Rapture which is coming to pass, and anything that God has in the line of His Word, there's always something to come out to upset That if they can. It's--it's--it's Satan's purpose to do that.\n\nL-35 As the brother here, from the meeting up there at Las Vegas, said, \"Satan said the world was his dominion, and--and that being his headquarters up there.\" I know that Satan is the god of this world. Every nation under heaven is controlled by him. Exactly. This world belongs to Satan, but Jesus will take it over. He offered it to Him one day. And He refused it, but, He said, 'cause He knowed He'd be heir to it in the times to come. [Matthew 4:8-9]\n\nL-36 \"Scoffers.\" Just us take for a few moments on that one word, before we go further. Scoffers! I was reading a paper, about two weeks ago, in Tucson, that where some Englishman from England had made a statement. It's in headlines in the paper, that the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ was only faked, between Pilate and Jesus, that He come to make... just to make Himself something. And there's no way that we could disprove that to them, because all the things of God is to be received by faith. We must believe it. Now, he went ahead to give a description how that that could be done. [II Peter 3:3]\n\nL-37 Here not long ago, in that great nation, London, in England, rather, where that John Wesley and Charles, and many of those great preachers of the early days, Spurgeon and them, had preached the Gospel in the hay markets and everywhere there. They turned down that message of their day, and look what they are in this day. There is where Brother Williams and them are tonight. It's one of the lowest degraded countries in the world. I've been over the world, but I don't know anything that's so illegitimate as England. It's... Billy Graham said the same thing. Why, he had to take his wife from the parks, how the--the--the acts of between men and women were going on, 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min publicly, in the parks. When I was there, I never seen anything would break a person's heart any more than what was going on in England; which had the opportunity, and, one time, led the world in a reformation. Just shows how it can fall.\n\nL-38 But, you see, what does that, the message that went forth then, the Englishmen try to hold that same message for today. That won't work today. It won't work. How would...\n\nL-39 What if Moses would have come and brought Noah's Message, \"We'll build an ark and float down the Nile\"? It wouldn't have worked. And neither would Jesus' Message have ever worked of Moses. And neither will Wesley's Message ever work in Luther; or Luther's Wes-... message, vice versa. And today, we, our last great reformation was Pentecost. And today we're moving from that. And the Pentecostal message won't mix with This, because it's another day. It's all the Word of God, but it's building. Like the feet, arms, coming up, it's forming a Bride for the Rapture. See? Don't--don't displace them people back there; they lived to their Message. All them will come out, was in the Bride. Just like life going through a stalk of wheat. It leaves the wheat, the hull, but the wheat forms itself like the grain of wheat that fell in the ground.\n\nL-40 Here not long ago, I was reading a book some German wrote, and criticism. He said, \"Of all of the--of the fanatics in the world, William Branham tops them all.\" He said, \"Why, he's nothing but a... He's a--he's a magician. He does these things.\" See, the man, not knowing.\n\nL-41 And, then, the man was a critic. He didn't even believe in God. He said, \"A God that could set up in the dark ages, hold His hands across His tummy, and laugh at a bunch of Christians; being mothers, and His Own disciples, was supposed to be; mothers with little children and things, and let lions eat them up; and never even turn a hand.\" You see where the carnal mind, where education and things, can't catch the vision? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-42 That corn of wheat had to fall into the ground. Just like Jesus had to fall, to rise again, so did the church of pentecost had to fall. It had to go into the ground, them dark ages. Any wheat that... Any grain that goes into the ground, it has to lay in that dark time, to bring forth. But it started sprouting in Martin Luther. Come on through Wesley. On out into Pentecost. Now in, to go out to the grain. And now the denominational systems that they left behind, they're stalks, that's all. It's to be burnt, the denomination system. But the real grain of wheat that come out of each one of those reformations will be caught up in the Bride. It all altogether will make the Bride. [John 12:24]\n\nL-43 Now we find out, in England there, they impersonated the crucifixion, not long ago, a bunch of those people, them long... kids with them long hair and things, and hollering, called Jesus \"daddy-o\" and all that stuff. Such scum!\n\nL-44 Now you say, \"That's in London, England.\" Watch what was in the paper last week, here in Americas. Some great doctor of divinity, from a fine school, said that the--the crucifixion was a fake. Said that, \"Jesus only tried to make Hisself like that; that He had dranken this mandrake weed.\" And we find it in Genesis, where it's spoke of. It's a weed like marijuana or something. It's found in the Orients there. And if you drink it, it'll put you to sleep. Maybe... And you're like you're dead, slump, everything, for two or three days at a time. [Genesis 30:14]\n\nL-45 He said, \"When they give Him vinegar and gall, it's all possible that that was mandrake weed. And when they did, they give Him that, and He went slump like He was dead. They put Him in the tomb, and they laid Him there. After two or three days, sure, going back, then He was awake again, was all right.\" Said, \"He went up in India and died somewhere, an ordinary death, trying to fake a religion.\" The first place, that critic, what's the matter with people? See, it's just this day we're living in, scoffers, see, the day to fulfill the prophecy. [John 19:29], [Matthew 27:48], [II Peter 3:3]\n\nL-46 God lotted His Word out to each age, and each one of those age has to manifest that. And He also foreordained men for that age, to fulfill that Word. Every time He lotted His Word, He lotted a man for It. When He lotted Moses' 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min time, He lotted Moses to It. When He lotted the time for the Son of God to be born, He lotted Him to it. Every age, He's lotted His man, foreordained, as the Bible said. Nothing...\n\nL-47 If God is infinite, Almighty, all powerful, omnipresent, omniscient, why, He knowed all things from the beginning. So, He knowed. There's nothing out of cater. It's just us that thinks it is. It's everything run. Look back in His Word and see what He's doing, then we'll have an understanding.\n\nL-48 Now, just think. The first place, if that minister would have thought, when they put that vinegar and gall in His mouth, He spit it out. He did not take it, at the first place. See? Just scoffers rising! Another thing, how did this Jesus of Nazareth, how did His life fit every prophecy of the Old Testament? How could it been? It couldn't have been without it been ordained of God. His life fit every prophecy of the Old Testament. Another thing, if those disciples had faked Him like that, why did each one of them die in martyrdom? And even apostle Peter said, \"Turn my head upside down. I'm not worthy to die like Him.\" How they took Andrew and turned him sideways on the cross. They, every one, sealed their testimony in their own blood. They believed Him and loved Him, and gave their lives for Him. If He was a faker, how would they ever done that? See? The spiritual application, the people don't get it. [John 19:29], [Matthew 27:48]\n\nL-49 Here was a great man here, not long ago, some great rabbi that wrote that, \"Moses, while passing through the Red Sea,\" said, \"it wasn't actually water. The waters never walled up.\" Said, \"What it was, up at the other end of the Dead Sea, there was a bunch of reeds. And he passed through the water reeds, the reeds of the water. No water in there. Just a bunch of reeds, an ocean of--of reeds they passed through.\" And many clergymen believe it, they, and accept it. [Exodus 14:21-22]\n\nL-50 Here not long ago, when this first astronaut went up, he come back, and he hadn't seen nothing of God. That even turned ministers around. They thought God lived right up there somewhere, a hundred and fifty miles high.\n\nL-51 Why, my, how education and wisdom of this world has turned the church into a bunch of ragweeds! The... Its education and the educational system, science and civilization, is of the Devil. It's the Devil's civilization. The Bible said so. And our Civilization that's coming on will have nothing to do with this civilization, at all. It's nothing of it, at all. There'll be a different Civilization, into this civilization and this scientific world we got. More science, scientific we get, further we go into death things, traps to kill, and everything. In that new Civilization, there'll be no death, no sickness, sorrow, or no pain. See? There won't be none in There. So this civilization will have to be destroyed, because it's of the Devil. [I Corinthians 8:11], [II Peter 3:11-13]\n\nL-52 We find out, that in Genesis 4, that Cain's people started civilization, building towns and cities, and so forth, and instruments of music, and become in science. And the people got further away from God, yet religious. But when Seth's people come on, they begin to come on, call on the Name of the Lord. Ah, talk about a subtle one! [Genesis 4:16-17, 25-26]\n\nL-53 I'm not here to hurt anybody's feelings, say something about a church. And if you're here, and belong to this church, I'm not saying this to hurt your feeling; 'cause just as many good people in there, as there is in other churches. But I was reading in Shreveport last week, where the Catholic church made a statement. And we see where they're all coming together now at the great ecumenical council, and so forth, just exactly fulfilling what the Bible said they'd do. Just exactly.\n\nL-54 Now we find out they said, \"Why, the Bible...\" Some of the Protestants want to hold to that Bible. \"Why,\" said, \"the Bible was nothing but a book, a history of the church, and they didn't have it in literature till about two hundred fifty years ago. It's always been the church.\" Said, \"It was the church, not the Bible, and the Bible is just a history of what the church did.\" What a subtle lie that is! Why, we've had the Bible for three thousand years. The Old Testament was been written in Scripture, for hundreds and hundred of years before the coming of Christ. Just a subtle thing of the Devil!\n\nL-55 And we find out in this day, when this great scoffing and making fun of the Bible, and trying to push It out, God has got to judge the church by something. He can't be just... 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min They can't go down this street and arrest me, and say I'm making thirty miles an hour in a twenty mile zone, unless there's something there to tell me that I'm only allowed to go twenty miles. It has to be there. And God is going to judge the church, is going to judge the people, some day. We know that. There's a Judgment coming. So if He's going to judge it by the Catholic church, which Catholic church? If He's going to judge it by the Methodist, the Baptist is lost. He judge it by the oneness, the twoness is lost. See? What's He going to judge it by? He said He would judge it by Christ, and Christ is the Word. So it's the Word of God, that God will judge. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. The same yesterday, today, and forever.\" See? So, He'll judge it by His Word. [John 5:22], [Acts 10:42], [II Peter 3:3], [John 1:1-2, 14], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-56 And now we find out that in this day, when they're trying to push the Bible out, \"Accept the church. The Bible; don't want It. The church,\" so they can just make any kind of a creed or anything else, and walk by it.\n\nL-57 Well, as I was speaking the other night at Shreveport. In the--the communion, when they kill that sacrificial lamb, there was to be \"no leaven among them, through the entire seven days,\" no leaven, no leaven bread. Everything had to be unleaven. That represented the seven church ages that we get in the book here, and there's no leaven. What? It's something mixed with It. And we mix creed and denomination, everything else, with the Word, and still try to call it the Word. \"No leaven, shall be the entire seven day.\" [Exodus 12:15]\n\nL-58 And even what is eat today, don't try to keep it for tomorrow. \"Burn it with fire, before daylight come,\" for there's a new Message coming forth, and a new thing. See, try to hold it over, but that's been the attitude of the church. A revival goes forth, and the first thing you know, within about three years, they start an organization over it. A denomination starts, organization. But have you noticed? This has been sweeping for twenty years now, and there's no organization. And there never will be. This is the end. The wheat has come back to the wheat again. The wheat has come back to Its grain. The shuck has pulled away from It. And the wheat must lay in the Presence of the Son, to be ripened.\n\nL-59 Isn't it a strange thing, that, not long ago, on the East Coast, the big blackout? They couldn't understand it. Texas blacked out, last week. They can't understand it. Don't you realize that that's a sign? Don't you know the nations are breaking? Israel is in her homeland. And these signs are indicating that we are at the end. The same time it's blacking out, don't you know that's a sign that the prophet said? Yeah. \"But there shall be Light about the evening time,\" that there will be a Light come forth in the evening time, when the blackouts and things are going the way they are now. [Zechariah 14:6-7]\n\nL-60 Look at just how it blacked out. The pope just come over here. 'Member, of the tabernacle, when them... You got tapes. I guess, all of you take them. How that the Lord showed there that day, in the tabernacle, exactly where those church ages would be and how they would be! I had them drawed out on the board up there, them church ages which you see here drawed out in a book. And if that Holy Spirit didn't come down in a big Pillar of Fire, and went right back there on that wall and drawed Them out, Hisself, while three or four hundred people setting, looking at It! And just as the pope started over here, the moon somehow blacked out. And they took their pictures the same way that it was drawed up there on the platform. Now he's made his trip over here on the thirteenth, walked thirteen steps, served communion to thirteen, to a nation that's number thirteen, and blackouts coming everywhere. Don't you see where we're at? We're at the end time.\n\nL-61 \"Scoffers shall rise in the last day, saying, 'There's no difference in the time than what it was, than when our fathers fell asleep.'\" But when you see these things begin to happen, raise up your head, get ready. Something could happen at any time, Christ come for His Church. [II Peter 3:3], [Luke 21:28]\n\nL-62 Now, they don't believe it, because it is a... it's a... They, they're suppo-... They don't realize that they're the ones that's fulfilling the Scriptures. The people really don't realize that, doing these things and saying these things, they're fulfilling the Scriptures. 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min How little did Caiaphas, the high priest, and all those priests in that day, that scoffed and made fun of Him, didn't know that, the very God that they were singing about, \"My God, why has Thou forsaken Me?\" The 22nd Psalm, \"My hands and My feet they pierced.\" Singing that in the temple, and Him dying out there on the cross. Little did they know they were doing it. Even Jesus prayed, \"Father, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing.\" Because, they were actually predicted, by the Scriptures, to be blind. [Psalms 22:1, 16], [Mark 15:34], [Matthew 27:46]\n\nL-63 Did you know the Protestant and Catholic church is predicted, in the last days, to be blind, the same thing, to the Scriptures, with Christ on the outside, trying to get in? \"Because thou sayest, 'I am rich, and have need of nothing,' knowest thou not that thou art miserable, poor, wretched, naked, and blind, and don't know it,\" Revelation 3. There you are, back to the blindness again, trampling over the things of God, as if (they) It didn't mean nothing to them, scoffing and making fun of It. That's what the Bible said. [Revelation 3:17], [II Peter 3:3]\n\nL-64 But, to the Church, the Bride, the Rapture is a revelation to Her. It's revealed to Her. That, the revelation, the true Bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture.\n\nL-65 Now, it is a revelation, for the revelation is faith. You cannot have a revelation without it being faith. Faith is a revelation, because it's something that's revealed to you. Faith is a revelation. Faith is something that has been revealed to you, like it was to Abraham, that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him, as though it wasn't so. Now, faith, that's what faith is, is the revelation of God. The Church is built upon a revelation, the whole entire Body. [Matthew 16:17-18]\n\nL-66 Here a few weeks ago, I was talking to a fine Baptist minister. He come up to discuss with me. He said, \"I like you as a man, but,\" said, \"you're all mixed up.\" I said, \"Then, I pray you help me get straightened out.\" (he said...) \"with the Scripture,\" He said, \"we'll never be able, Brother Branham, to get the things together till we get every Word upon Word, upon Word, exactly with the Greek, and so forth.\"\n\nL-67 I said, \"Oh, sir, you know better than that.\" I said, \"Even in the Nicaea Council, way back as far as that, three hundred years from the death of Christ, they were still debating which Greek scholar was right. You can know. It's a revelation, the whole thing. Is re-...\" He said, \"I cannot accept revelation.\" I said, \"Then how can you accept Christ?\" He said, \"Why, the Bible said, 'He that believeth is... on Jesus Christ, has everlasting Life.'\" [John 3:16], [John 6:40, 47]\n\nL-68 I said, \"That is true. It also says that no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the revelation of the Holy Ghost that's revealed it to him.\" See? There you are, right back around again, falls right back to the revelation. It's got to be revealed, in the Bible. [I Corinthians 12:3]\n\nL-69 Cain and Abel didn't have a Bible to read, but it was revealed to Abel, by faith, which is a revelation. Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain. Which, God testified that he was righteous. [Hebrews 11:4] When Jesus was asked here, Matthew 16:17 and 18. We haven't time to read it, but if you want to write it down. He said, \"Who does man say I the Son of man am?\" \"One of them said You're 'Moses, Elias, or so forth.'\" He said, \"But Who do you say I am?\" [Matthew 16:13-15]\n\nL-70 He said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" [Matthew 16:16]\n\nL-71 He said, \"Blessed art thou, Simon, son of Jonas, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you. My Father which is in Heaven has revealed This to you. Upon this rock,\" the spiritual revelation of Who God is, Who Jesus is. And He is the revelation of God, God made in flesh and revealed to the world. \"He was in the world. God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself, revealing what God was, in a body of flesh.\" \"Thou art the Christ, the anointed One, the Son of God.\" [Matthew 16:16-18], [Mark 8:29]\n\nL-72 He said, \"Flesh and blood never revealed this to you, but My Father which is in Heaven has revealed this to you. 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min Upon this rock I'll build My Church, the revelation of the Word in Its season. I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell cannot prevail against It.\" [Matthew 16:17-18]\n\nL-73 The Book of the Revelations is the last Book of the Bible. It's sealed to unbelievers. In there, the Bible says, in 22nd chapter, \"Whosoever shall take one Word from It, or add one word to It, I'll take his part from the Book of Life.\" We realize that, then, it was altogether given for believers. And It opens the Book of Revelations and reveals Who the Author of this entire Book is. \"He is to look upon as Alpha and Omega,\" from Genesis to Revelations, Jesus Christ just the same, right straight through. And reveals His complete mystery of Himself, and His plans for His church ages that's to come, and was sealed in there by Seven Seals. [Revelation 22:18-19], [Revelation 22:13], [Revelation 1:11]\n\nL-74 Now, the Book was written, but then, remember, It was sealed with Seven Seals. And these Seven Seals was not to be opened (Revelations 10) until the sounding of the last earthly angel on earth, Revelations 10:7. See? \"And in the days of the sounding of the last angel's Message, seventh angel, the mystery of God should be finished in that age.\" That, and that's the age that we're living in. [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-75 We all know we're living in the Laodicea Age. There will never be another age to it. It can't be. So, we're living in the Laodicea Age. And these Seven Seals that's held that Book, is a mystery to people, should be opened at that day. That's what He promised. Now, it won't be nothing outside the Word, because you can't add to the Word or take from the Word. It's got to remain always the Word. But the revelation is to reveal the Truth of It, what It is, to make It fit with the rest the Scripture. And then God vindicates that to be the Truth. See? [Revelation 3:14-22]\n\nL-76 God don't need no interpreter. He is His Own interpreter. He does His Own interpretation by bringing to pass the things that He said would happen. Like, in the beginning, He said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. That don't need any interpretation. It was vindicated. [Genesis 1:3]\n\nL-77 Now, He promised certain things in this last day, in the Scripture. Why, there it was. That's how Jesus was the Son of God. He promised to send Him. When He was in His days here on earth, and the people couldn't believe Him, He said, \"Search the Scripture, for in Them you think you have Eternal Life, and They are They that testify of Me. If I do not the works of My Father, then believe Me not. But if you can't believe Me, believe the works that I do, 'cause they testify Who I am.\" [John 5:39], [John 10:37-38]\n\nL-78 Well, then, in Wesley's age, the works that he did testified who he was. In Luther's age, on reformation, why, sure, it testified who he was.\n\nL-79 In the days of the Pentecostals, the restoring back of the gifts, the restoration of the gifts, speaking in tongues and casting out devils, and the gifts, why, it testified. There was no joke about it. People said, when it first raised up... I read the books on the history of Pentecost. They said, \"It can't last long. It'll burn down.\" It's still burning. Why? Is because you'll never put it out. God said it would be there. It's that portion of the Word, and no more could you put that out. And then when the Bride is being called out, how you going to put it out? It's the revelation of the manifestation of the Word made true. And we're living in that day; praise be to God; the revelation of the mystery of Hisself.\n\nL-80 Now, the Rapture is only... This Rapture that we're talking about, is only for the Bride. Remember, the Bible said, \"And the rest of the dead lived not for a thousand years.\" This great Rapture! If there's not a Rapture, friends, where are we at? What are we going to do? What age are we living in? What promise do we have? There is going to be a Rapture. The Bible says there will be. And It'll be only for the elected, the Elected Lady, the Bride in this day, that's pulled out, the Church. [I Thessalonians 4:15-18], [Matthew 24:40], [Luke 17:36]\n\nL-81 The very word, church, means \"called out of.\" As Moses called a nation out of a nation, the Holy Spirit is calling a Bride out of a church; a Church out of a church; members, from every denomination, making up a Bride, Bride tree. It's in the--in the tape, The Bride Tree. A Bride coming out, call, and that's the one that the Bride tree is. The--the Bride, rather, is the One that's going to be in the Rapture; that, alone, nothing but the Bride, the elected ones foreknown by God from the beginning, the Father's spiritual genes. Let me just stop here a minute. And I keep getting nervous, thinking I'm going to hold you, going to hold you too long. 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min\n\nL-82 But, notice, look, each one of you people. Do you know, years before you were born, you were in your father as a gene? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] That's right. A germ, a seed, was in your father; comes from the male sex, not the female. See? Female furnishes the egg, a bedding ground. But the germ come from the fa-... Now, say, in my father...\n\nL-83 Or, my son setting here, when I was sixteen years old, my son was in me. I didn't know him, but he was there. Now, through a bedding ground, through holy wedlock, he becomes in the image of me. I know him. I can fellowship with him. And he come just at the time when it's the right time.\n\nL-84 Now, so were you in, if you've got Eternal Life, you were a... in God before there ever was a world. You are a part, a son of God, an attribute of God. He knowed the very age you were coming. He predestinated you to that age, to take that place, and no one else can take it; care how many impersonations and things. You've got to be there, because He knew you would be there. Now you are made manifest. Now you can fellowship with Him, and that's what He wants. He's longing for fellowship, to be worshipped. But if your life did not... always was as an attribute in God, you're just a mimic of Christianity. See? There'll be millions and billions of them, they'll just be mimics of Christianity. [I Peter 1:2], [Ephesians 1:4-5]\n\nL-85 A remark that I made just recently. I was watching Brother Demos Shakarian over there, when they was having hybreeding cattle, watch the test tubes, and so forth, being taken in by doctors, and watching these things.\n\nL-86 In the literal discharge of the male, there's somewhat a million germs comes forth from the male at each time. And somewhat a million eggs comes from the female at--at the same time. But did you know, in all them little germs moving around, a million of them, there is only one of them ordained to life, and there's only one egg fertile? And that little germ will crawl right up through every one of them other little germs, right over the top of every little germ looking just like him, and come over the top of that and come over here, and find that fertile egg and crawl into it. And then all the rest of them die. Why, talk about the virgin birth, oh, it's not half as mysterious as a physical birth, how it's foreordained, predestinated by God!\n\nL-87 Now, in the beginning, way back, way years ago before there was a time began, you, if you are a born-again Christian, tonight, you were in God then, your Father. That's why, when you come into this life here and profess Christianity, well, everything going wrong, you've wondered why this is, and all this. It, you wondered at it. But, one day, Something struck you. What was It? That Life that was down in there, from the beginning. And if it... [Ephesians 1:4-5]\n\nL-88 Like my little story about the eagle, finding it, its mother finding the eagle. You've heard me preach on that, how that little eagle was hatched under a hen. But she, her habits of trying to feed them--them chickens, the little eagle couldn't stomach it, because he wasn't a chicken, to begin with. Yet, he was in the pen with the chickens, and follow the chicken. But she would scratch in the barnyard and things, and the little eagle couldn't stand it. But every time she would cluck and everything, all the little chickens go, so he would go too. But one day...\n\nL-89 His mother knew that she had laid two eggs, not one. There had to be another one, somewhere. She went to hunt it, flying around, circling. Finally she come over the barnyard, and she found her baby, and she screamed to him. It was a voice, that, he realized that that's the thing that fit. That was what he's looking for, see, and he realized then that he wasn't a chicken. He was an eagle. And that's the way, every born-again Christian, when you come. I don't care how many denominations you joined, how many names, you put your name on the books and things. When that real Word of God is vindicated and made true before you like that, you realize you're an eagle, right there. Because, all this clucking of the hen, \"You join this and join this, and go this way and that way,\" it's nonsense. It's a genuine, adding Word to Word.\n\nL-90 When a germ comes into the womb of--of the female, it don't take on... You, you didn't become a human germ from your father, and then the next thing you become a germ from a dog, and the next thing from a cat, the next thing from a chicken. It was all human germ. And the Body of Jesus Christ, the Bride, will be part of His Body. Which will... He was the Word, and the Bride will 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min have to be the Word; Word added to Word, add to Word. Luther's justification, Wesley's sanctification, pentecostal's baptism of the Holy Spirit, restoration of the gifts, and all the rest of It, goes with It. See? It's got to be Word on top of Word, germ on top of germ, Life on top of Life, to bring out the full statue of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, remember, you was an attribute. [I Peter 1:23]\n\nL-91 And now, the thing of it is, after we find out these things, that Christ is Coming for His Bride, now how do we get into that Bride? That's the question. Many say, \"Join our congregation.\" One of them wants a certain type of baptism. One wants to do this or that. One said, \"You must speak with tongues, or you haven't got It.\" The other one said, \"You don't have to speak with tongues.\" This one says, \"You must dance in the spirit.\" This says, \"You must shout.\" This, \"Got a sensation.\" It's all all right, and then, still, it's all wrong. How could a man that's... or a woman, or a child of God, that's born of the Spirit of God, deny the Word of God? When, God Himself interpret It and say, \"This is It. I promised It. Here It is,\" showing It just as plain as It can. Why, they're bound to see It. See? How could Christ deny His Own Word? And if Christ is in you, It can't deny His Own Word.\n\nL-92 Then how do we get into this Body? First Corinthians 12, \"By one Spirit we're all baptized into this Body, by one Holy Spirit baptism.\" That, if you want to put that down, it's First Corinthians 12:13. \"And by one Spirit we are all baptized.\" And the Spirit is the Life of Christ. Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] The Life of Christ! And the life of any seed... Which, He was the Word Seed, brings the Seed to Life. You get it? If that--if that Life is laying in the Seed, and this baptism of the Holy Spirit comes upon It, it's bound to bring that Seed Life. [I Corinthians 12:13]\n\nL-93 As I told you, here at Phoenix, not long ago. I was talking to Brother John Sharrit. I was out there, and he showed me a tree, a citrus. He--he raised a lot of citrus fruit. And he showed me one tree, it had eight or nine different kinds of fruit on it. And I said, \"Brother Sharrit, what kind of tree is that?\" Said, \"An orange tree.\" I said, \"Why is the lemon, and the tangerine, and tangelo, and grapefruit?\" He said, \"It's all citrus fruit. They're grafted.\" \"Oh,\" I said, \"I see. Now, next year, it'll all have oranges. Be...\" \"Oh, no. Each tree will bear its own. Each limb will bear its own fruit.\"\n\nL-94 Many of you fruit growers know that, here in this citrus valley. It'll bear its own. You put a lemon branch in an orange tree, it'll bear lemons, 'cause its the nature of a citrus fruit. Yet, it won't bear the original fruit. And that's what we've done. We've grafted in, taken in with creeds, and so forth, and grafted in each, Here. How can the Methodists bring forth anything but a Methodist child? How can any denomination bring forth anything but a denominational child?\n\nL-95 But if that tree ever puts out an original branch, it'll bring forth oranges. And then if God ever does anything in the Church, it'll be original, back with the Word again. Exactly. It has to be, 'cause the Life is in the Tree, and It bears Its own kind.\n\nL-96 Now, when we find out, now, there's that big church has moved down, through the ages, bearing its fruit. And as the limbs quit, they prune them off. In Saint John 15, never pruned the Vine out, now. He took the branches off, cut them out, because they wasn't bearing any fruit. And--and we... [John 15:2]\n\nL-97 Jesus wants fruit of, for Hisself. His Wife must bring forth the kind of a children that He is. Then, if it don't bring forth children, Bride children, Word children, then it's the denominational child. Then, her first love, for the world and denomination, she's gone back to that. And it can't bring forth a real, genuine, born-again Christian, 'cause there's nothing there to bring It forth.\n\nL-98 Just like if you take a lemon branch and stick it in there, it'll bring a lemon, but it can't bring a orange, because it wasn't there at the beginning. But it was ordained at the beginning, foreknowledge of God, predestinated and born, it has to bring forth an orange. It can't bring nothing else.\n\nL-99 That's the way with the Church of the living God, when the hour comes. Everybody... You let God start to do 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min something, everybody has got the ball and gone. See? It's always been that way. I was reading in history, of Martin Luther, here not long ago. Said, \"The... It wasn't so hard to believe that Martin Luther could protest the Catholic church and get by with it. But,\" said, \"the strange thing, that he could hold his head above all the fanaticism that followed his revival, and still stay straight on his justification.\" See? Just everything, impersonations and everything, followed him.\n\nL-100 Look at Mrs. Semple McPherson, Aimee Semple McPherson, that had this temple over here. Every lady preacher had them wings, and packed the Bible the same way, just--just carnal impersonations! They can't be original. That's the way the churches can't be. You let one church get something another in the city, the other church can't stand it. They get it. See? They're not original any more. God's Word is original. It's the Word, and It has to bring forth Its kind; Its kind in Its season, elected, predestinated by the Father, God.\n\nL-101 Now how do we get in this Church? \"By one Spirit we are all baptized into this one Body, Body of Christ,\" which is the Bride, the Word. \"Baptized in there by the Holy Spirit.\" [I Corinthians 12:13]\n\nL-102 Now let's notice whether we're in the last age, or not. Now we find out, if we turn back in Genesis, about the, oh, about the 5th chapter, you can also turn to Luke and find out, that Enoch was the seventh from Noah. Enoch. There catches the serpent's seed. For, if Cain was Abel's son, then he was the eighth. See? But nowhere in the Bible it said that Cain was Abel's son... or Cain--or Cain was Adam's son. Because, that, the Bible said, \"He was of that evil one.\" And Adam wasn't the evil one. See? \"He was of the evil one.\" [Jude 1:14]\n\nL-103 Now we find here that Enoch was the seventh from Noah, which was a type of the church ages. Now, all of the rest of the six men, before him, died, but Enoch was translated. Enoch was raptured, the seventh, showing that it's the seventh church age that takes the Rapture. Now, there's no doubt, we're in the seventh church age. We all know it. [Jude 1:14]\n\nL-104 Now, it's the seventh church age that takes the Rapture. All of the other six died. But Enoch was translated, because, \"He was not found. God took him.\" But Enoch, raptured, was a type of all of the rest of them dying. But the--the end-time Bride will be called out of the... The rapturing, without death, will be called out of the seventh church age, which we are now bearing record of that age. Oh, my! Let's dig in now, real deep. See? [Jude 1:14]\n\nL-105 Now, here, also, a type of the seven church ages, which, in Revelation 10:7, that the great mystery of the Book was to be unfolded by the seventh angel's Message. [Revelation 10:7]\n\nL-106 Now, there's a Messenger above, always, and a messenger on earth. The English word angel means \"a messenger.\" And in the seventh angel's Message, while he was making his proclaiming, his ministry, \"then when he begin to sound forth his ministry,\" not when he started out. Jesus, when He started out, He started healing the sick and afflicted. \"Oh, that great Rabbi! He's a Prophet.\" Everybody wanted Him in his church. But when He set down one day, and said, \"I and My Father are One,\" that was different. That was different. \"And except you eat the flesh of the son of Man, and drink His Blood, you have no Life in you.\" \"Why, He's a vampire!\" See? See? That was different. He didn't explain it. They had already seen the manifestation, the vindication of the Word of God for His age, made real and proved to them that He was that Messenger of that age. And He didn't have to explain nothing. [John 10:30], [John 6:53]\n\nL-107 Those disciples might not have been able to explain It. But they believed It, whether they could explain It or not. They set right still and believed It. How could they tell if they was going to eat His flesh and drink His Blood? Why, it was impossible for them to do it. But they believed It, because they were ordained. Jesus said He \"chose them before the foundation of the world.\" See? They believed it. Whether they could explain it, or not, they still believed It. [Ephesians 1:4]\n\nL-108 Now watch, now, in the seventh church age, \"When the seventh angel begins to sound, the mysteries of God was 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min to be made known right there,\" the Seals. That, the reformers that... been they had time. Luther didn't live long enough, neither did Wesley. The ages didn't live long enough, them reformers. They had their message of that day, and the people grasped it and denominated it. And what is it? [Revelation 10:7]\n\nL-109 You can never beat nature. Nature always testifies. God runs in continuity with nature. It has to. Like the sun. The sun rise in the morning, it's a little baby born. It's weak, ain't got much heat to it. Ten o'clock, it's coming out of high school. Middle the day, it's entering into life. Three o'clock in the afternoon, it's getting old. Five o'clock, it's dying. Old and weak again, going back to the grave. Is that the end of it? It rises again, the next morning. See?\n\nL-110 Look at the trees, how they put forth their leaves, everything that they do. Now we find out, the leaves drop off the tree, go back. What? The life goes down to the root of the tree. Is that the end of it? Comes back next spring, with new life.\n\nL-111 Now watch the churches, how it's done the same thing in the reformation. It come up. That corn of wheat fell in the ground and died, under the dark-age persecution. It went into the ground. It had to die. Any man, spiritual, can see that. Unless that seed dies and rot, it abides alone. And it had to go into ground, under the dark age. It laid there, rotted. And come forth in two little blades of the Lutheran church. Out of the Lutheran church, brought off more blades, Zwingli and so forth. From that come on up into the tassel, which was John Wesley, the great missionary age. It dropped back. Out of there come that deceiving age, that Pentecostal age. That corn of wheat, that... [John 12:24]\n\nL-112 Anybody ever, here, ever raise any wheat? You look at that wheat when you look at it. When you go out there, say, \"I've got wheat.\" You look like you got a wheat there. Open it up real close and watch. You haven't got no wheat at all. You got a shuck. Didn't Jesus warn us that, in Matthew 24:22... -four? \"In the last days, that, the two spirits would be so close together, it would deceive the elected wheat Itself if it was possible.\" See? Now watch. It's a carrier. [Matthew 24:22-24]\n\nL-113 Now, the Life that come up through Luther was what made Wesley. The Life that come out of Wesley is what made Pentecost. The Life that comes out of Pentecost makes the wheat. But they are carriers. See? The real Life goes through there. The Message goes through, but It's heading on up into the wheat. That's the reason the wheat come up and brings the whole thing in the Rapture, up here at the top. The Bride, Itself, comes out of each age. But the denominational stalk dies, dries up and dies. Have you noticed, this last days, how it's begin to pull away now? When that wheat begins to grow, then the--the shuck begins to get away from It.\n\nL-114 Look back in that little wheat when you look at it. Pull it open like this, and look into it and see. You got a little bud of wheat back there. You have to take a thirty-power scope to look into it, to see the little bud of wheat back there. See? It's way back in there, but It starts growing. Now, that shuck has to be there, to shelter That, to give It a chance to get out. But then when It begins to grow and the Message begins to spread, then the shuck pulls away from It. And the Life goes right out of that shuck, right into the wheat. Goes on! That's the way each age done. It just--it just can't beat nature. It's... That's God's continuity, the way He does things.\n\nL-115 And now that's the age that we're living in right now, the seventh church age. Now, it's all to be manifested in the grain of wheat at the end, another come back. Now, if you take Luke the 17th chapter and the 30th verse, He said, \"As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man, when the Son of man begins to reveal Himself.\" What is reveal? Make His revelation of what He is in this day. Reveal, out to the people, the Word that's made known for the day. Reveal, to the people, by the manifestation of Holy Spirit making that Jesus live among us. And, remember, He was represented there in a man. A man! He said, \"As it was...\" Now, He read same Bible we read, Genesis. Now, we notice in that Genesis chapter there, when Jesus was speaking about it. [Luke 17:28-30]\n\nL-116 We find there, that, in that, with His back turned to that tent, and Sarah in the tent. He said, He asked a question. And she didn't believe that what was going to happen could happen. He said, \"Now, Abraham, I'm going to visit you 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min according to the time of life.\" See? And Sarah, in the tent, laughed about it. He said, \"Why did Sarah laugh, in the tent, saying, 'How can these things be?'\" [Genesis 18:9-15]\n\nL-117 Jesus promised. And That was Him. Abraham called Him, \"Elohim,\" the Almighty. That was Him. Now, the Bible predicts that it will return again in the last days. Jesus said so. \"And when you see these things begin to come to pass,\" just remember, when this starts to taking place like that then, that, \"you know that the time is nigh at the door.\" [Luke 21:28, 31]\n\nL-118 Look at the world itself. Look at the world, Sodom, if there ever was a Sodom. Look at the people perverted in such a perverting. Their minds are perverted. They don't know what common decency is. Look at the outlaw... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... sexuals and everything. And look at our women, what a rampage it's made. Look what a rampage of indecency, immoral amongst our women. And not only our... You say, \"That's Methodists.\" That's Pentecostals, too. It's the whole thing. [Jude 1:7], [Luke 17:28-30]\n\nL-119 Look at our men. They hang, instead of the Word of God, in some little tradition of denomination. They hang onto it, instead of coming out when they see God make Hisself known perfectly. The reason, they're blind. They can't see It. They never will see It. Now watch what takes place here in this, while we hurry. I think that lady wants us to leave. I seen her motion her hand, something another about she wants us to get out, so we better hurry.\n\nL-120 So now notice Enoch, the type of the Church. Here he's also typed in the seventh church age. Can you think of that? The seventh church age! Notice. \"At the sounding...\"\n\nL-121 How many believes there's been seven messengers for the seven chur-... Oh, we all believe it, if we believe the Bible. If we don't believe the Bible, course, see, we don't believe it. But, there has been.\n\nL-122 Now we're living in the seventh church age. And when the Bible said that, this seventh church age, \"When the messenger of the seventh church age begins to sound his Message, that the mysteries of all the things that's been twisted up, down through the age, would be revealed in that time.\" Here we see it, the Son of man coming among His people and doing just exactly, confirming His Message as He said He would do. Here we find it, in this last age now. [Revelation 10:7]\n\nL-123 And the seven watches, like the seven watch, of one come. He didn't come the first watch, second, third, fourth, but come in the seventh watch. That was Enoch, the seventh, which was translated. And Noah, being a type of the remnant of Jews, is to be carried over. Now, in the Bible times, talking about the watches. And nights were not divided into hours, in the Bible time. [Jude 1:14]\n\nL-124 Now listen closely. Cause, I'll hurry now, 'cause they want the room. No. The Bible was not divided, or--or...\n\nL-125 The night was not divided in hours, in the Bible time. It was divided in watches. There was three watches. Now, the first watch started at from nine until twelve. The second watch started from twelve to three. And the third watch of the night was counted from three to six. Now we got three, three three's, which is a nine, imperfect number. Then we come back to the seven for the Rapture, which will take place, I believe, between six and seven o'clock... or six and nine o'clock, some morning. \"For the trumpet of the Lord shall sound.\" On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise, And the glory of His resurrection share; When His chosen ones shall gather to their homes beyond the sky, When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there. [Luke 12:38]\n\nL-126 The word Rapture, in the Bible, is not even used at all. We just put that word there. The Bible says, \"caught up; being caught up.\" We read here in Second Thessalonians... Or, First Thessalonians, it is the order of this great Rapture that will take place in the last days. Listen to this here. We're going to begin here with 13th verse. ... I would not have you... ignorant, brethren, concerning those which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min that have no hope. For if we believe... Christ died and rose again, even so them... which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For we say this unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent... (That word prevent means to \"hinder.\")... those that are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend... Now listen close. ... the Lord himself shall descend from the heavens with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and... the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:... [I Thessalonians 4:13-18]\n\nL-127 I want you to notice a great thing taking place here now. Don't miss this. See? Now notice. The Word says here, in Second Thessalonians, that there is three things. Notice. From the 13th to the 16th verse, there is three things that has to happen before the Lord Himself appears. Quickly now, so we can close. See? The first thing happens... Notice: a shout, a voice, a trumpet. Let's read It now and see if that's right. See? For the Lord himself (16th verse) shall descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and... the trump of God:... [I Thessalonians 4:16]\n\nL-128 Three things happens. A voice... A shout, a voice, a trumpet, has to happen before Jesus appears. Now, a shout... Jesus does all three of them when He's--He's--He's--He's descending. A shout, what is the shout? It's the Message going forth, first, the living Bread of Life bringing forth the Bride. [I Thessalonians 4:16]\n\nL-129 Now, God has a way of doing things. And He never changes His policy. He never changes His po-... He's the unchanging God. In Amos 3:7, He said, \"He would do nothing on the earth until first He revealed it to His servants the prophets.\" And just as certain as He promised it, He'll do it. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-130 Now, we've come through the church ages. But we're promised in the last days, according to Malachi 4, that there would be a return again, a prophet in the land. That's right. Notice his nature, what he would be like. He's alway... God uses that spirit five times: once in Elijah; in Elisha; in John the Baptist; call out the Church; and the remnant of the Jews. Five times, \"grace,\" J-e-s-u-s, f-a-i-t-h, and it's the number of grace. See? All right. [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-131 Now, remember, the Message is promised. And when all these mysteries has been all so bundled up by a bunch of ecclesiasties, it will take a--a direct prophet from God to reveal It. And that's exactly what He promised to do. See? [Revelation 10:7]\n\nL-132 Now, remember, \"The Word of the Lord comes to the prophet,\" not the theologian. The prophet, he is a reflector of God's Word. He can't say nothing; he can't say his own thoughts. He can only speak what God reveals. Even to the prophet Balaam when he was tried to be sold, sell his right, he said, \"How can any prophet say anything but what God puts in his mouth?\" It's a thing that God does, that you can't say nothing else. And you're born that way. No more than you could... [Revelation 10:7], [Genesis 15:1], [II Samuel 7:4-5], [II Samuel 24:11-12], [I Kings 6:11-12], [I Kings 17:24], [Acts 3:18], [Numbers 23:26], [Numbers 22:18]\n\nL-133 If you could say, \"I--I--I can't open my eyes,\" when you're looking. See? You can't. You can't reach your hand, when you can. See? You can't be a dog when you're a human. See? You're just made thus. And God has always, too, in the ages, through Isaiah, Jeremiah and all, the Elijah, in the ages gone by. When the ecclesiastical group would get everything all mixed up, He would send a prophet, raise him up from nowhere. He belonged to none of their situations, and speak His Word. Called off a scene, and gone, just rugged men of the Truth of God. And it's always the way you could tell him. He said, \"If there be one among you who is spiritual or a prophet...\" [I Corinthians 14:37-38]\n\nL-134 Now, prophets. There's such a thing as \"gift of prophecy\" in the Church; but a prophet is predestinated and foreordained for the hour. See? Yes, sir. Now, if a prophecy goes forth, two or three has to set and judge whether that's right or not, 'fore the church can receive it. [I Corinthians 12:4, 10]\n\nL-135 But nobody set before a prophet, 'cause he was--he was absolutely the Word of God. He was that Word in his day. 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min You seen God reflect. Now, God has promised to send us that again in the last days, to bring the Bride out of that ecclesiastical mess, in the only way it can be done. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-136 It'll never be done; the church can't receive Christ. We, the Pentecostals, we can't carry this Message on in the condition the church is in today. How we going to carry out the end time in the condition they're in today, when every one against the other, and everything else, and ecclesiastically? Oh, mercy! It's a mess. It's done gone in denominations. And any time... I ask any historian to--to--to say different. Every time that a message went forth in the earth, and when they organized it, it died right there. And Pentecost done the same thing that they all did, the Pentecost that come out.\n\nL-137 You, Assemblies of God, when your forefathers and mothers come out of them organizations back there, in the old General Council, shouted and praised God, and talked against those things. And you turn, \"like a dog to its vomit, and a hog to its wallow,\" and done the same thing that they did. And now so ecclesiastical, you shut up your bowels of compassion. You have to have a fellowship card before you can even associate with you, hardly. [II Peter 2:21-22]\n\nL-138 You, oneness, God given you a message like that, and instead of you going ahead, and just keeping humble and go ahead, you had to turn loose and organize your group. And where are you all at? The same bucket. That's exact. And God's Spirit, moving on. \"I the Lord have plant It. I'll water It, day and night. Lest some should...\" He ordained these things to be, and He must send This. [Isaiah 27:3]\n\nL-139 The first thing comes, when He starts descending from the Heaven, there's a shout. What is it? Is a Message, to get the people together. A Message comes forth, first. Now, lamp-trimming time, \"Rise and trim your lamps.\" What watch was that? The seventh, not the sixth. The seventh, \"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh. Rise and trim your lamps.\" And they did. Some of them found they didn't even have any Oil in their lamp. See? But it's lamp-trimming time. It's Malachi-4 time. What He prom-... Is Luke 17. It's--it's Isa-... All those prophecy that It can perfectly set in order for this day, in the Scripture, we see it living right there. There's no... [I Thessalonians 4:16], [Matthew 25:6-9], [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-140 See these things happen, my dear brother, sister. When, God in Heaven knows I could die on this platform right now. You--you just ought to walk around a while. It's just... It's tremendous, when you see God come from the Heaven, stand before groups of men, and stand there, declare Himself just as He ever did. And that's the Truth, and this Bible open. See? Right. We're here.\n\nL-141 And the denominational system is dead. It's gone. It'll never rise again. It'll be burned. That's what you do with the husk on the field. Flee from it. Get into Christ. Don't say, \"I belong to Methodist. I belong to Baptist. I belong to Pentecostal.\" You get into Christ. If you're in Christ, there's not a Word written in Here but what you believe It. I don't care what anybody else said. And then God makes that thing manifested. Cause, you, when He pours the Spirit upon the Word, what happens? Just like putting water on any other seed. It'll live, and It'll bring forth of Its kind.\n\nL-142 You say, \"I got the baptism, the Holy Ghost.\" That don't mean that you're saved, not by a long ways. [Matthew 5:45], [Hebrews 6:7-8]\n\nL-143 Looky here. You are a triune being. You are. Inside this little fellow here is the soul, the next is the spirit, and next is the body. Now, you got five senses in this body, to contact your earthly home. They don't contact the rest of it. You got five senses of the spirit, here: love and conscience, and so forth, of that. But in here is where you live. That's what you are.\n\nL-144 Didn't Jesus say, \"The rain falls on the just and the unjust\"? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Put a cocklebur out here, and a wheat out there, and pour water on them, and keep them under fertilize and things like that, won't they both live by the same water? [\"Amen.\"] Sure. Well, what is it? One of them will bear a cocklebur, 'cause that's all he is. The cocklebur will raise his hands and shout just the same as the wheat. , [Matthew 5:45], [Hebrews 6:7-8]\n\nL-145 Don't the Bible say, \"In the last days, there shall come false Christs\"? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Not \"false Jesus,\" now. \"False Christs,\" anointed ones, falsely anointed to the Word; denominational anointed, but not to the Word. For, the Word will bear record of Itself. It don't need nothing else. It'll bear record to Itself. 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min \"And there will come false anointed ones.\" You got my tape on that. And that anoi-... Oh, if you'd call one of them, say, \"Oh, you, are you a Jesus?\" \"Oh, certainly not.\" They wouldn't stand for that. [Matthew 24:23-24], [Mark 13:21-22]\n\nL-146 But when it comes to an \"Oh, glory! I got the anointing!\" And it's the genuine anointing. Remember, Caiaphas had It, too, and prophesied. So did Balaam have It, and prophesied. [Numbers 24:10], [Joshua 24:9-10], [John 18:14] But that don't have nothing to do with this, inside. Unless that was God's seed, His gene from the beginning, predestinated, you're finished. I don't care how much you shout, speak with tongues, run, shout. That has nothing to do with it. A cocklebur can count just as much as any the rest of them. I've seen heathens raise, and shout, and speak in tongues, and--and drink blood out of a human skull, and call on the Devil. See? So you don't... Any of them sensations and things, forget it. It's your heart in that Word, and that's Christ. Bring in there, and watch It make Itself known, just as It opens up like any other seed, and declares Itself for the age It's living in. [Hebrews 6:7-8]\n\nL-147 Luther could bring nothing but sprig. These others could bring these other things. We're in the wheat age now. Luther's genuine Luthers had to bring forth genuine Luther. Genuine pentecost had to bring genuine pentecost. That's all. But we're past that age, and going on.\n\nL-148 You know, the Catholic church, started out, the pentecostal? And if the Pentecostal church would stand two thousand years, it'd be in worse shape than what Catholic is now. That's exactly. I say that to my brethren, my sisters, who I love. And God knows that. But remember, friends, I got to meet you yonder at the Judgment. And that may not be too long. I've got to bear record of what's the Truth.\n\nL-149 When I went forth into the meetings with you, praying for the sick, it was fine. But, when I come with a Message! If any Message goes forth, it's a true Message... If it's the true, genuine miracles of God, and hangs right in that organization, you know it's not of God, 'cause that thing is already declared. Jesus went forth and healed the sick, in order to catch their eyes, the people, then His Message. That's right. It has to have something that God is going to introduce. He just... Divine healing, His miracles like that, just catch the eyes of the people. The main heart of It is the Message. There's what is, what comes from in here. He's trying to get the favor of the people, so they'll set and listen to Him, see, for there's some in there that's ordained to Life. Some of the grain, wheat, fell on ground, the birds picked it up. And others fell amongst thorns. And some was, went on prepared ground, pre-prepared ground, and brought forth. [Mark 4:3-20], [Luke 8:5-15], [Malachi 4:2]\n\nL-150 Now, it's the first thing, is the sounding. The first thing is a trumpet and a... or a voice... A shout; and then a voice; and then a trumpet. Shout: a messenger getting the people ready. The second is a voice of the resurrection: the same voice, that, a loud voice in Saint John 11:38-44, that called Lazarus from the grave. Getting the Bride together; and then the resurrection of the dead, see; to be caught up with It. Now watch the three things takes place. The next is what? Was a trumpet. A voice... A shout; a voice; a trumpet. [I Thessalonians 4:13-18], [John 11:38-44]\n\nL-151 Now, the third thing, is a trumpet. Which, always, at the feast of trumpets, is calling the people to the feast. And that'll be the Bride's Supper, the Lamb's Supper with the Bride, in the sky. See? [I Thessalonians 4:16-18]\n\nL-152 The first thing comes forth is His Message, calling the Bride together. The next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping Bride; the--the ones died, back in the other ages, they're caught together. And the trumpet, the Feast in the heavens, in the sky. Why, that's the thing that takes place, friends. [I Thessalonians 4:16-17]\n\nL-153 We're right there, ready now. The only thing, the Church coming out, has got to lay before the Son, to ripen. The great combine will come by, after while. The wheat will be burned, the stalks, but the grain will be gathered into 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min Its garner. See? [Matthew 3:12]\n\nL-154 You're not blind people. You're--you're sensible people. And if I stood here and said those things for prejudice? I say It because It's Life, because I'm responsible to God for saying It. And I must say It, and my Message. All the time, knowing, back there under healing and so forth like that, was just to catch the people's attention, knowing the Message would come. And here It is. And them Seven Seals opened, those mysteries, and showing those things is what's happened. I didn't know it. [Malachi 4:2], [Revelation 10:1-7]\n\nL-155 But there is men standing right here now, was standing right with me. When, you all heard me preach that sermon: Sirs, What Time Is It? That morning, exactly where It said It would be, there stood seven Angels standing right there, from the Heaven. And as They went up, and the whirlwind taking Them up there, we standing, watching as They went away, science took the picture of It, all the way across the nations, down into Mexico.\n\nL-156 And there, when I was watching, one day, when I started preach these Seven Church Ages. And I called Jack Moore, a great theologian. I said, \"Jack, Who is this Person standing there? 'There is One like the Son of man standing there, hair as white as wool.'\" I said, \"He was a young Man, how could He have hair as white as wool?\"\n\nL-157 He said, \"Brother Branham, that was His glorified body.\" That didn't ring the bell. But when I went in the room and started praying, He let me know what it was. See?\n\nL-158 I've always preached that He was Deity, not just a man. He was God manifested in the flesh: God, the attribute of God, of love; the great attributes that come down, displayed here on earth, of God. Jesus was God's love, which built a body that Jehovah Himself lived in. He was the fulness of the Godhead bodily. What God was, He manifested through that body. That body had to die, so He could wash the Bride with His--with His--with His Blood. [Colossians 2:8-9]\n\nL-159 And notice, not only is the Bride washed, forgiven, but She is justified. See? Did you ever try the word justified, to see what it means? Now, for instance, if Brother Green heard that I had been drinking, I been doing bad things, then he found out that I didn't do it. Then he come, say, \"I forgive you, Brother Branham.\" [Galatians 2:16-17]\n\nL-160 \"You forgive me? I never done it. What you forgiving me about?\" See? But if I'm guilty, then I can be forgiven; but I'm still not just, because I did it. But the word justified is \"though you never done it, at all.\" Justified! And then the Blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us so from sin, till it's put in the Book of God's forgetfulness. He's the only One can do it. [Romans 8:30]\n\nL-161 We can't. We can forgive but not forget. I could forgive you, but I always remember you done these evil things. Then, you're not just; you're forgiven. But, in the sight of God, the Bride is justified. She never done it, in the first place. Amen. Standing there, married to the virtuous Son of God; never sinned, in the first place. Why? She was foreordained. She was trapped into this. And now when She heard the Truth and come forth, the Blood cleansed Her. And She stands there, virtuous. See? She, no sin on Her, at all. [Romans 8:30]\n\nL-162 Therefore, the Message calls the Bride together, see, the shout. And the trumpet... The same One, He, with a loud voice, He screamed out with that shout and a voice, and woke Lazarus. With a loud voice He cried, \"Lazarus, come forth.\" See? And the voice wakes up--wakes up the sleeping Bride, the sleeping dead. [John 11:43], [I Thessalonians 4:16]\n\nL-163 And the trumpet, \"with the sound of a trumpet.\" And, when it does, it calls. Always, a trumpet called Israel to the feast of the trumpets. See? Which, was a pentecostal Feast, the great Feast in the sky; and the feast of the trumpets. And, now, a trumpet denounced a calling together, \"Come to the Feast.\" And now that is the--the Lamb's Supper in the sky. Now watch. The assembling together; and the Bride; the feast of the trumpets, the Wedding Supper. We have seen it in types. Now watch just a moment before we close. Notice. We seen it in types. [Matthew 24:31], [I Corinthians 15:52], [I Thessalonians 4:16] 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min\n\nL-164 Now, if you want to read in Matthew 18:16, It said. There is three that bear record,\" see, in Saint... in First John 5:7, so forth. Three is always a witness. Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] It's a verification, something that's right. Three witnesses bear. \"In the mouth of two or three witness, let every word be established.\" [Matthew 18:16], [I John 5:7]\n\nL-165 Now notice. We've had three witnesses. Three is a witness. Now, we have already had three raptures in the Old Testament. Did you know that? As a witness. Now watch. Enoch was one; Elijah was the other one; and Jesus was the other one. Jesus, being the Keystone, now, He bear record. See? He was the Keystone between the Old and New Testament, 'cause He had to first die and then rapture. He died; come to life and walked around here with us; and then was raptured up. Because, He was the Keystone that tied the two together. After His resurrection and rapture... Look. After He did that, and proved that, the Old Testament there. We all know Enoch was translated. We know Elijah was taken up by a whirlwind, that right, in a chariot of Fire. And Jesus died, buried, rose up and lived here on earth, and then was raptured up, the Keystone. There is three, to bear record. Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] [Genesis 5:24], [Hebrews 11:5], [II Kings 2:11-12], [Matthew 28:6-7], [Mark 16:6-9], [I Corinthians 15:4]\n\nL-166 Now, there has been one rapture already passed. You know that? That, let's see if we can't read it, right quick. Let's get Matthew, the 27th chapter. And let's get about the 45th verse of the Matthew, the 27th chapter. Let's see if we can't get that right quick, and see if--if we can't get just a little bit out of this, would help us, right quickly. 27:45, I believe, I got wrote down here. Let's read. Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth... And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabach-...? which to say,... my God, why has thou forsaken me? Some of them that stood by,... heard it, and said, This man calls... Elias. And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink. The rest said,... let us see whether Elias will come and save him. Jesus, when he had cried... with a loud voice, yielded up... \"A loud voice.\" Loud voice! Watch. When Jesus, dying, screamed with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks did rent; And the graves were opened; and many of the bodies... the saints that slept arose, And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. [Matthew 27:45-53]\n\nL-167 One rapture is passed. Three has happened in the Old Testament, of them prepared, who the Word of the Lord came to. See? The Word of the Lord came to Enoch. The Word of the Lord came to Elijah. He was a prophet. See? The Word of the Lord was Jesus. See? [Genesis 5:24], [II Kings 2:11-12], [Matthew 27:52-53]\n\nL-168 Watch in the Old Testament, them Old Testament saints now, when this rapture first taken place. Notice verse 50. His loud voice awakened the Old Testament saints just exactly like the loud voice wakened Jesus... or wakened Lazarus. See? The loud voice awakened. And the second is fulfilled in Second Thessalonians, the 4th chapter. Let's just take a read, read it. We just read, a few minutes ago. See? ... I would not have you... ignorant, brethren, concerning those... asleep, that you sorrow not, even... That's First Thessalonians 4:12 to 18. That, that will be the second Rapture. The second Rapture will be the catching away of the Bride. [I Thessalonians 4:12-18], [Matthew 24:40], [Luke 17:36]\n\nL-169 The Old Testament saints has gone into His Presence, paradise done away. And the Old Testament saints 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min ascended up, at His loud voice, when He screamed and give up the ghost; because (why?) the Sacrifice, the propitiation of their sins, that they had waited on, believing that perfect Lamb was coming. They had offered the Sacrifice, the Lamb. And when He died and yielded up the ghost, He screamed with a loud voice, and the Old Testament saints awoke. Watch the shout and the voice over here, the same thing at His Coming. See? \"Yielded up the ghost.\" And when He did, the Sacrifice was perfect, and paradise emptied out. And the Old Testament saints came to the earth again, walked around on earth, and entered in with Him, at His rapture. [Matthew 27:50-53]\n\nL-170 David said, over there, \"Lift up, ye everlasting gates, and be ye lifted up.\" \"He led captive captive, give gifts unto men,\" and the Old Testament saints went in with Him. [Psalms 24:7, 9], [Ephesians 4:8]\n\nL-171 They said, \"Who is this King of righteousness?\"\n\nL-172 \"The Lord of Glory, mighty in host.\" Mighty host, here they come in, marching. \"Jesus led captivity captive,\" and here He comes, with the Old Testament saints. And went in the new gates up There, and said, \"Lift up, ye everlasting gates, and be ye lifted up. And let the King of Glory come in.\" The voice come from the inside, said, \"Who is the King of Glory?\" [Psalms 24:8, 10], [Psalms 24:7]\n\nL-173 \"The Lord mighty in battle.\" The gates flew open. \"And Jesus, a Conqueror, led captive captive,\" them that had believed on Him, and the Word had come to them. There, the Old Testament saints laying in there, waiting, \"He led captive captive; ascended on High,\" took the Old Testament saints and went in. There is one Rapture, already passed. [Ephesians 4:8]\n\nL-174 The next Rapture takes place is (Second Thessalonians) for the Church, the Bride to be resurrected, to be raptured into Glory. \"We which are alive and remain,\" that's the bodies left on earth, \"will not prevent or hinder them which are asleep. For the trumpet of God shall sound first, and the dead in Christ shall rise.\" See? \"And we which alive and remain shall caught up together with them.\" [I Thessalonians 4:12-18]\n\nL-175 Other day, I was standing on the street corner. And I--I was standing on... I was standing on the street corner and watching the Armistice Day parade, and when it went up, going up the street. I stood there with my little son, Joseph. There come, the first, was the old first war tanks come by, little old tanks. After that come the great Sherman tanks of the new war, and a great cannons with their muzzle blast, a--a muzzle break on them, so forth. After there, come the soldiers; the--the--the Gold Star mothers. And then there come a float with the... on down... Well, down there come a float, and on the front of it was a grave, \"to the unknown soldier.\" And there stood a--a soldier standing there, guard at the grave. There stood a marine on the other side, and a sailor on the other side. And there was a partition drawed. And on the other side set a Gold Star mother. She had lost her boy. There stood a young wife, with her head over on a table, crying. A little ragged boy setting sideways; and the tears running out of his face. He had lost his daddy. I thought, \"What sadness! I stand here and look, see them, old, just a few of the soldiers left; marching down there, crippled and old, like that, with their uniforms, but proudly displaying them because they were Americans.\" I thought, \"Oh, my God!\"\n\nL-176 One day, there will come a blast from Heaven, \"And the dead in Christ shall rise first.\" Them Old Testament saints back yonder, who are waiting, will blast forth and come out of there first, and go into the resurrection. We'll drop right in line, going into the sky; these old mortal bodies changed and made like unto His Own glorious body. What a--what a parade that'll be when it starts heavenward, some of these days, in that rapturing time that lays ahead, oh, proudly displaying the Blood of Jesus Christ upon their chests, the Message of God in the hour that they lived in. That's the hour that we're looking forward to, brother. [I Thessalonians 4:13-18]\n\nL-177 Looky, just in closing now. The second resurrection, all... First one is past. The second one is at hand, right now, will come to hand now.\n\nL-178 Now, the third one is the two witnesses of Revelations 11:11 and 12. Which, these are the ones that turns back, with the Spirit of Christ, to witness to the Jews, like Joseph did to his brethren. And remember, \"Their dead bodies laid 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min in the street, for three days and a half. Then the spirit of life came into them, and they were raptured, taken up into Heaven.\" There is your three raptures of the New Testament. Three raptures of the Old Testament; all of them past. [Revelation 11:11-12]\n\nL-179 Now we're ready, waiting for the raptures, the Rapture of the saints. It's been spoken, and so shall it be. When God says anything, \"All heavens and earth will pass away, but that Word will never fail.\" [Matthew 24:35]\n\nL-180 When God said, back there in Genesis 1, He said, \"Let there be light.\" It might have been hundreds of years before there was any light. He said, \"Let there be a palm tree. Let there be a oak tree. Let there be a desert. Let there be a mountain. Let there be this.\" He spoke it, you see. And as long as it went out of His mouth, in a Word, it has to be manifested. It has to be. When... [Genesis 1:3]\n\nL-181 Then one day, He called His people out. And He had spoke to a man named Moses, by a Pillar of Fire, a Light; Holy, Sacred Fire. And Moses wouldn't... The people wouldn't believe Moses, so He said, \"Bring them out to this mountain.\" [Exodus 19:9-12, 16-18]\n\nL-182 That morning, the mountain was all full of Fire, and flashing and thunders like that. And the people said, \"Don't let God speak. Let Moses speak, see, lest we perish.\" [Exodus 20:19]\n\nL-183 God said, \"I'll not speak to them no more like this, but I'll raise them up a prophet. And I'll speak through him, and what he says will come to pass. Then, you hear It, because I am--I am with him.\" Now, He spoke that. He said that it would come to pass. [Deuteronomy 18:18]\n\nL-184 Look at this prophet, Isaiah, standing there; a man, intelligent man, a man was thought of, well, by the king, 'cause he had lived with Uzziah. The king, which was a great man, tried to take a preacher's place, one time, and went in, got smitten with leprosy. And that's what I told the businessmen. Don't never try to take a preacher's place. No, sir. You stay right where you're at. See? You do your work, what God put, told you to do. If you're a finger, you can never be an ear. If you're an ear, you'll never be a nose, nose or eye. See? You stay in your position. [II Chronicles 26:18-21]\n\nL-185 You heard that Message, other day, on the broadcast: Trying To Do God A Service. David, anointed king. All the people shouting and screaming, \"It was right.\" But he never consulted God's prophet. And a man died, and the whole thing was marred. Don't try to do God a favor. You wait till it's God's term. Let it come in His way of doing it. \"I'll start this big thing. It'll do this.\" Be careful, brother. [I Chronicles 3:1]\n\nL-186 Now, David knowed better than that. Nathan was in the land, in that day. He wasn't even consulted, at all. See? He consulted captains of hundreds and thousands. All the people shouted, and screamed, and danced. Instead of... They had all the religious motion, but it wasn't in the line and order of God's Word, and it failed. Anything else, is not in the line and order of God's Word, will fail. Only God's Word will stand forever. \"Heavens and earth will pass away, but not My Word.\" [Mark 13:31]\n\nL-187 Notice Isaiah, that intelligent young man standing there. All at once, the Spirit hit him. He couldn't say no different. He was a prophet. He said, \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive.\" \"Unto us a Son is born; a Child is born, a Son is given. His Name shall be called Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God, Everlasting Father. The end of... His government shall be upon His shoulders. The end of the... There shall be no end to His reign.\" How could that man intelligently say that a virgin would conceive? Everybody looked for it. It's done been spoke. It was THUS SAITH THE LORD. It had to come to pass, 'cause it was God's Word. The same as it was in Genesis, when He planted them seeds down beneath the sea, where \"it was without form, and void; and water upon the deep.\" See? It had to come to pass. And one day, eight hundred years later, the womb of a virgin conceived the Seed of God, a created Seed. She brought forth a Son. [Isaiah 7:14], [Matthew 1:23], [Isaiah 9:6]\n\nL-188 That same Son stood there, one day. He said, \"Lazarus, come forth.\" And a man that been dead four days, rotten, his nose fell in, stunk, he came forth. Said: 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, amen, when all that's in the grave will hear the voice of the Son of God, So, it's done been spoke. It has to happen like that. There's going to be a Rapture. Oh, my! [John 11:43], [John 5:28]\n\nL-189 I remember, just my last Message in California, where I thought I'd never go back again, when I predicted, \"Los Angeles will go beneath the ocean. THUS SAITH THE LORD.\" It will. She is done. She is washed. She is finished. What hour? I don't know when, but it will be sunk. Right after that, the earthquakes begin to jolt and bow. [Matthew 11:23]\n\nL-190 Remember, many of you men standing right there, that rock, that day when that Angel came down there. And that Light and Fire falling from the Heaven, around the rock where we were standing there. Rocks flang out of the mountains, and falling across there. She blasted three times, hard. I said, \"Judgment will strike the West Coast.\" Two days after that, Alaska almost sunk.\n\nL-191 Remember, that same God that said that, said, \"Los Angeles is doomed.\" And she is finished. I don't know when. I can't tell you.\n\nL-192 I didn't know I said that. But this brother here, I believe it was... No. One of the Mosely's, I believe, had me out on a street out there. I didn't know what it was till I looked back. I looked back in Scripture. And Jesus said, \"Capernaum, Capernaum, how oft... You that's exalted yourself, rather, up into Heaven, shall be brought down into hell. For if the mighty works that been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it'd a stood today.\" And about a hundred and fifty years from there, (Sodom had already, in the earth) then Capernaum is in the water, too, today. [Matthew 11:23]\n\nL-193 And that same Spirit of God that said all these things, and done all these things, It said there, \"Oh, city, Capernaum, who called yourself by the name of the Angels, Los Angeles, how you've exalted yourself into heaven! The very root and seat of Satan, see, you've exalted yourself.\"\n\nL-194 Preachers, it's a graveyard for them. Good men go there and die like rats. What havoc!\n\nL-195 \"You that call yourself by the name of the Angels; if the mighty works had been done in Sodom, that been done in you, it'd stood today. But your hour has come.\" You watch and see. If it ain't, I'm a false prophet. See? There she is. She's laying there.\n\nL-196 I remember that night, 'fore I seen that, I seen the preview of the Bride. I stood there and seen a beautiful little lady, just correctly dressed, and things, marching this way. There was Somebody standing by me, in the vision. And I seen. They said, \"The preview of the Bride.\" I seen Her go by. They come on this side, and went around.\n\nL-197 I heard it coming up, the--the churches coming up from this other side. There come the Asian church. Oh, you talk about filth! Here come the European church. Oh, my! And then I heard a rock-and-roll coming, and it was Miss America, the church, and she didn't even have on any clothes. She had papers, like newspapers, gray, hold in front her, dancing by rock-and-roll; Miss America, the church.\n\nL-198 I stood there in His Presence. I thought, \"O God, as a minister, if that's the best we could do? Oh! Oh!\" You know how you feels. Then I thought, \"God, hide me. If I could just get away from here. If all that we've done, and that's what we have to produce, if that's what?\"\n\nL-199 And then when them women passed by, all doing all kinds of rocks and things, and short hair, and painted faces. And as they passed by like that, supposed to be virgins to Christ. And when she passed by like that, I turned my head, you know, with this holding in front of me. It was--it was disgraceful, the back of them. And there they was, going like that. And I turned my head, to weeping, like that.\n\nL-200 I said, \"I--I couldn't stand it in there. Him standing there, and me know that me, a minister of the Church, and that's what I had produced for Him.\" I said, \"O God, I can't look at it. Let me die. Let me--let me fade away,\" and like that.\n\nL-201 And as soon as it went out, every time one of them would come, they'd go out to a certain place, then drop off. I'd just hear the sound of it as it went away. 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min Then I heard something like Onward Christian Soldiers. I looked, and here come that sainted bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was, all correctly dressed, their hair hanging way down in their back. Smooth, clean, marching like this, to the step of the Gospel. She was the Word. They looked like one out of every nation. I was looking at it as they passed by, and seen them pass by. Instead of going down, they started going up. I noticed one of them trying, two or three of them trying, getting out of line. I screamed. \"Stay in line.\" And the vision left me. And I was standing in the room, screaming, \"Stay in line.\" Line, That.\n\nL-202 Wonder, could it be already past? Could the Bride already be called? Is that what we're going through today? She has to be molded and made into the image of Christ, and Christ is the Word. That's the only thing. See? It's in There, in the Word. It's ju-... See? There cannot be one thing added. It can't be a--a woman with a one hand like a man, and the other hand with a paw like a dog. It's got to be exactly the Word of the Lord, like He is the Word. The Bride is a part of the Bridegroom. The woman is a part of her husband, 'cause she's taken out of the husband. Eve was a part of Adam from his side. And so is the Bride, not taken from a denomination, but taken from the bosom of the Word of God for this day.\n\nL-203 The Rapture! The trumpet of the Lord shall sound, the dead in Christ shall rise, And the glory of His resurrection share; When the chosen ones shall gather to their Home beyond the sky. When the roll is called up yonder, let's all try to be There, friends. God bless you. [I Thessalonians 4:13-18]\n\nL-204 It's been spoken. It has to come to pass. It will come to pass. And little... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] People, no one wants to die. No one wants to--to be lost. Let me tell you. Whatever you do... I don't care how well you go to church, and how loyal you are to church. That's fine; nothing against that. You should go to church. You do that. Keep on going to church. But, whatever, just throw away your traditions, and move right on up into Christ. Cause, it's going to sound one of these days, and you're going to be caught with the mark of the beast on you, and not know what it is until it's too late. That's exactly right.\n\nL-205 God bless you. I'm sorry to have kept you. And remember. I've kept them too long here. That's right. And the offering that you taken for me... Which, I did not ask you to do that, brother. That's, my, that's courtesy. Take that and pay this motel the--the overtime, 'cause I kept it. I just had a few things here. I got about eight or ten more pages on that Rapture there, but I--I just didn't have time to give it. God bless you.\n\nL-206 Do you love the Lord Jesus? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Let's just stand still just a minute now, quietly, reverently, and remember what I've said. Remember, we're in the last hours. These nations are breaking, Israel's awakening, The signs that the Bible foretold; The Gentile days numbered, with harrows encumbered; \"Return, O dispersed, to your own.\" The day of redemption is near, Men's hearts are failing for fear; Be filled with the Spirit, your lamps trimmed and clear, Look up, your redemption is near. You know that? False prophets are lying. God's Truth they're denying. We know that all is true. Don't we? [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree.\n\nL-207 How many really love Him. Raise your hand. Now, I want you, while we sing this again, shake hands with 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min somebody near you. Say, \"God bless you, pilgrim.\" We are pilgrims. Aren't we? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Pilgrims and stranger. I love Him, That's it, right across the table. I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree.\n\nL-208 You want to make the Rapture? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] How many is interested in making the Rapture? Say, \"God, I want to make it, with all my heart.\" Hold To God's Unchanging Hand, you know the song? You know it, sister? Hold To God's Unchanging Hand. I don't know what... What's it in, for that one? Huh? Hold to God's unchanging hand! Hold to God's unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God's unchanging hand! You like that? When our journey is completed, If to God you have been true, Fair and bright your home in Glory, Your enraptured soul shall view! Hold to God's unchanging hand! Hold to God's unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God's unchanging hand! I want you to bow your head just a moment now. Covet not this world's vain riches, That so rapidly decay, Seek to gain the Heavenly treasure, They will never pass away! Hold to God's unchanging hand! Hold to God's unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God's unchanging hand!\n\nL-209 With your heads bowed, and this in mind, knowing that we're bowing our heads to the dust from which we were brought, some day we'll return, knowing that you got a soul in there that has to answer to God. And if you feel that you're not just ready for that Rapture, if It would come tonight, and you'd want to be remembered in prayer, just raise your hand. We have no place to make an altar call. Your altar is in your heart, anyhow. Raise your hand. God bless you, you, you. My! \"Feel that I'm not ready, Brother Branham. I--I, really, I--I--I want to be a Christian. I've tried to be, but there's always something missing. I--I know that I--I'm not just where I should be.\" \"Have mercy, God. I raise my hand. Be merciful to me.\" Now, some twenty or thirty hands has been up, already, in this little group. More is going up.\n\nL-210 Dear God, You know what's behind that hand, down there under the heart. I pray, dear God. There's only one thing I'm responsible for, that's, to tell the Truth. And, dear God, they want to be saved. They want to, really. They--they don't want this something that's just some emotion, some work up, some denominational system, some creed, some dogma that's been added. They understand, Father, that it takes the pure, unadulterated Word of God. 65-1204, The Rapture, Ramada Inn, Yuma, AZ, 101 min Everything else will pass away, even heavens and earth, but It won't. And if we be that Word, the earth will pass from beneath us, but we can never pass away, because we are that Word, the Bride of the Groom. [Luke 21:33]\n\nL-211 I pray for each one, that You'll grant to them, Father, is my sincere prayer. And excuse me, Father, for being so nervous tonight, jumping up here late, and--and being shaky, and saying words broke up and cut up. Somehow another, great Holy Spirit, splice them together in Your Own Divine way, and deliver them to the hearts of the people, from my heart, and the motive and the objective that in my heart I have towards You. Won't You, Lord? And save which can be saved. Draw to You, Lord. And may we be ready for that rapturing hour that's soon at hand. For I ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. God bless you. Now, the chairman of the--of the convention. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

This place holds many great memories of the days gone by. And to hear that, the visit here, and still have living influence, why, it certainly makes you feel glad that the Lord directed us this a way, years ago.\n\nL-2 I was just setting out there in the parking lot, just now, trying to remember of one of the events that taken place. There was a Mrs. Isaacson had been my interpreter in Finland, on a Finnish campaign, and she came to the car when I was just leaving. And she said, \"Your voice of Finland.\" And I just wonder if Mrs. Isaacson lives around here. I didn't know. She wouldn't happen to be present tonight, I suppose? Mrs. May Isaacson, and she's from Finland.\n\nL-3 Then another outstanding thing that brought to my memories, was a little waitress in a restaurant that I eat, somewhere near, they call the Antlers Hotel. I believe that's right, now. And the little lady had... I was praying with her. She had... She, nice little lady, but she wasn't a Christian. I invited her to the meeting. And she had lost a baby, and I believe that her husband, they was separated. And we was praying that she would make up with her husband, or they would make up, together. So, I just wonder if that little lady could be present. See? The...\n\nL-4 And then another event taken place, was a little baby that was brought from somewhere, about a day's drive. And it had died, and was laying in the mother's arms. And was brought back to life. Is that... Was that person present here? And it come, I believe, from the state up in this way, around, was above here. And the little mother had drove all night long, and the father, and the little mother setting there, sadly, holding her little, dead-form baby. And I thought, \"Such faith!\" If I was the biggest hypocrite in the world, God would have honored that mother's faith. Holding the little baby in my hands, like that, praying. Got warm, it begin moving, opened its little eyes. I hand it back to their mother. So, they was from somewhere. I do not think they were Pentecostal, though. They were just... I believe it was just some church, that from... I don't know even if they was Christians, or not. Never asked them. I was just so elated about the little baby being brought to life again. Since then, Brother Boone, much water has went down the river. But we're still serving the same God Who remains the same yesterday, today, and forever. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-5 Just looking around, seeing Brother Leroy Kopp setting here. It's the first time I seen him for a long time. [A brother says, \"He's Paul Kopp here.\"--Ed.] Paul. That's right. Leroy is your father. That's right. [\"And he--he's in Russia, tonight, so pray for him.\"] Oh, my! Russia. Well, that's, I know, this gallant soldier there, he's there on the business of the King. [\"Right.\"] So, I'm certainly happy to be here and to hear this young minister saying he was inspired by the ministry that we had while we were here. Such a great thrill that is! And I am trusting now, that, knowing we got... People are standing, and we won't keep too long. We remember those great healing services.\n\nL-6 Then, I understand that there is a--a--a brother here in the neighborhood, somewhere, holding a healing campaign, a Brother Leroy Jenkins. I believe that's right. And so I'm very thankful, trusting that the Lord is blessing him and giving him a great, great service. It... My, I felt really honored, tonight, to come into a church like this. I always feel better in a church than I do in those auditoriums. There's nothing against the auditorium. But, you know, I... It may be a superstition, or I just... Seems to me like a truth. See? They... You go into those auditoriums where there's fights, wrestles, burlesque, everything else going on, evil spirits seems to hang around them places. Now, that may seem a superstition, but it isn't so. But when you come into a church, you... usually, certainly a spiritual congregation, it seems like, that is, you--you feel more at liberty, like there's--there's something. The Presence of God is there. You know, it seems to be different. I don't know what effect the building has, but it's where the people are congregated. Course, the same, people are at the other place, but on those evil grounds. May be just me thinking that way. But, anyhow, I'm glad to be here tonight.\n\nL-7 And now we want to not keep you too long, 'cause a standing audience. And we are going, tomorrow night, at some 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min other place here. I don't even know where it's at. It's near here. [A brother says, \"Orange Show Auditorium.\"--Ed] Where? [\"Orange Show Auditorium.\"] Orange Show Auditorium, for the services tomorrow night. I... This is between, I'm speaking on a tour for the--the businessmen's Full Gospel Business Men's group. Which, I've had the privilege of speaking around the world, for them. And so in there, a very dear friend invited us over here, and we're glad to be in the assembly tonight.\n\nL-8 Now, before we open the Bible... Now, anybody that's got physical strength can open It in this manner. See? But it takes the Holy Spirit to open the Word to us, open our understanding and reveal the Scriptures. I believe in the Bible. I believe that It's God's Word. I believe that the earth, or the peoples of the earth, will be judged someday by this Word. Now, that may seem strange. Now, there's many different with that idea. [John 16:13], [Romans 2:16]\n\nL-9 I was talking to a very loyal friend of mine, not long ago, who is Catholic. And he said, \"God will judge the world by the Catholic church.\" If that's so, which Catholic church? See? So, if He judges it by the Methodist, then what about the Baptist? See? If He judges it by one, the other one is lost. So, there's too much confusion there. But we have to go to It, to find our--our true statement, and the Bible says that God will judge the world by Jesus Christ. And He is the Word. Saint John 1, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\" And Hebrews 13:8 said, \"He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" And I believe that to be the Truth. Now, I believe that. In... [Romans 2:16], [John 1:1, 14], [Hebrews 13:8], [II Timothy 4:1], [John 9:39]\n\nL-10 God, in the beginning, being the infinite God; He is finite and... or infinite, rather. We're the finite. His mind is so much greater, and we, in our little finite mind, cannot understand His great, infinite wisdom. But therefore, when He speaks anything, it may seem very strange to us, to hear Him say a certain thing in the Scripture, but it's got to happen. I believe that His Words will never pass away. Therefore, I believe that God, knowing that we in our little finite mind could not interpret His--His great mind, He interprets His Own Word. He doesn't need any interpreter. He interprets His Own Word, by vindicating that Word in Its season. [Isaiah 55:7-9], [Matthew 24:35], [Mark 13:31], [Luke 21:33], [I Corinthians 2:16]\n\nL-11 I believe that, God, in the beginning, that Noah was the Word for that day, for His Message. [Genesis 7:1-23] Now, along come, after that, come Moses. Now, Moses could not have taken Noah's Word. He could not build a ship and floated them out of Egypt, down the Nile River, or to the promised land, or so forth. His message didn't work in Noah's day; that was the part of God's Word that was vindicated to be Truth by Moses. [Exodus 3:1-4] Neither could Jesus have had Moses' Word. And the Luther could have not maintained the word of the Catholic church. Wesley, he could not maintain Luther's Word. And the Pentecostal, they could not take the Methodist Word. They... See? [Revelation 3:1-6], [Revelation 3:7-13] The Church is growing. Each age, it's lotted in the Scripture here. So, God, through the Holy Spirit, reveals His Word, by manifesting It and vindicating It, Hisself, showing that It's His Word being brought to pass in the day that It's promised. [Titus 1:2-3]\n\nL-12 Jesus said that. He said, \"If you can't believe Me, believe the works that I do,\" for they testify of who He was, see, if anyone would have knowed the Scripture. Now, He come so oddly, so strange, that the people didn't want to believe Him, because, \"He, being a Man, was making Himself God.\" So, He was God, in form. \"God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself.\" \"And no man can do these works without God be with him,\" as we know Nicodemus said that. That, the Sanhedrin believed that. [John 10:38], [John 3:1-2], [II Corinthians 5:19]\n\nL-13 Now, we know that, that Word. If they would have known the Word! He said, \"If you'd have knowed Moses, you'd have knowed Me, because Moses wrote of Me.\" And we look. If they had looked back in the Scripture, see what the Messiah was supposed to do, then they'd have knowed Him by the vindication, that, \"God, through Christ, was reconciling the world to Himself,\" and bringing to pass all the promises that was of the Messiah, that He was to do. Jesus bore record of that Word, making that Word live for that day. [John 5:46], [II Corinthians 5:19], [Revelation 1:1-2], 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min [John 8:14]\n\nL-14 And I believe that's the same thing we live in today: God bearing record of His Word, by vindicating what He said He would do. Now, we know that this is the day of salvation, where God is calling men from the world, from a life of sin, unto a life of service. And in the day that God has poured out His Spirit from on High, great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day. This is the... when the former and latter rain are falling, together. And we know that there is supposed to be great signs and wonders. Which, in many great denominations, This is turned down. But I'm very thankful for these open doors that I've had, to go into, and the inspiration it's give to young men like your pastor here. That's caused them... As I'm beginning to get old, and know that my days are numbered, and know now that these young men can take this Message and sweep It on to the Coming of the Lord, if He doesn't come in my generation. Which, I'm hoping to see Him. I look daily for Him, watch, keeping myself prepared for that hour. [John 8:14], [Acts 2:17-21], [Jeremiah 5:24], [Hosea 6:3], [Joel 2:23], [James 5:7], [Luke 12:37], [Matthew 24:42-46]\n\nL-15 Now let us speak to the Author before we read His Book, as we bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we are grateful to Thee, to be alive tonight, to return back to this great city. Setting here in this panoramic here of the mountains, looking up and seeing the snow, and the orange blossoms blooming, at the same time, what a magnificent world You've give us to live in! And how that we see that man has disturbed and--and acted in this world, it makes us ashamed of ourself, Father. We are here, tonight, to try to put forth our efforts, to try to cause men to see this great thing that God has done, and know that there's something greater just beyond. May we look to that, tonight, Father, as we turn in to Your Word and read. We can read It, Father, but let the Holy Spirit reveal It to us through the revelation. For we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-16 Now, you that like to perhaps take notes, and--and to read the Scripture with the minister, as--as usually they read It. And it used to be, when I... years ago, I didn't have to write down my Scriptures, and so forth. But I've got a little older since then. See? I just passed twenty-five, just recently, twenty-five years ago. So, it makes it a little bad. But I'm still trying to hold on to everything that I know to do in His Word, until He calls me.\n\nL-17 Now, let us turn to Saint John the 14th chapter, very familiar Scripture that we want to read tonight, to draw from this a context, the Lord willing. Nearly all knows this. It seems to be, many times, it's used in funeral services. There ever was a time that I'd like to preach a funeral service, it'd be to this world. Let it die and be born again. Saint John 14:1 through 7, I believe, I have marked down here. Let not your hearts be troubled: if you've believed in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house is many mansions:... it were not so, I would have told you. I go and prepare a place for you. ... if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. ... where I go you know, and the way you know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know... where thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus said unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If you had known me, you should have known my Father also: and from henceforth you know him, and have seen him. [John 14:1-7] May the Lord add His blessings to the reading of His Word. And we'll refer to It again, in the times as we go on, while we want to just speak a little lesson to the Church.\n\nL-18 Last evening, I was in Yuma; Arizona, where my home now. I--I... When I was here before I lived in Jeffersonville, Indiana. Now I been in Arizona, by a vision sending me there, a few years ago. And we resident there now. I don't have any church there. Brother Green, our brother here with us, has established a tabernacle where the... one of the Assemblies of God, a church, downtown assemblies. They emerged, and I think they all went in with Brother Brock and with Brother 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min Gilmore, left this church open. And Brother Pearry Green, from--from Texas, moved in and took the place, which is associate with us. We're glad to know that--that Brother Green has reopened this church that was closed.\n\nL-19 And last night, speaking over in Yuma for the Christian Business Men, I spoke on the subject of The Rapture. Now, that might been a strange subject to speak among, at a--a banquet, but most everyone there was Christians. And that's the way it is on these campaigns like this, or in--in a church. I could say now, \"How many of you is Christians?\" Probably every hand would go up. You're a Christian. And so, if we're Christians, I think we ought to be kindly notified ahead. We don't have to just guess at it. We're notified what our destination will be.\n\nL-20 And I want to speak on that tonight. And the subject is going to be: Things That Are To Be. And now, speaking last night on The Rapture, so tonight, I want to speak on this subject, that I might tie it together with last night's Message. Now, there is going to be a Rapture, we know that. That's in the future, to be.\n\nL-21 Now, Jesus here is speaking, about, He's gone ahead to prepare a place for us. \"Let not your hearts be troubled.\" Now, He was talking to Jews. Said, \"Now, you believed in God, believe also in Me. As you have believed in God, believe in Me, because I am the Son of God.\" See? \"And, God,\" other words, \"I and My Father are One. My Father is dwelling in Me. And what you see do, I'm doing, it's not Me. It's My Father that dwelleth in Me. He doeth the works.\" \"God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself.\" [John 14:1], [John 10:30], [II Corinthians 5:19]\n\nL-22 It was easy for those Jews who had been taught, through generations, to believe that there was a great supernatural God. But to think that that God had come down and was manifesting Himself through the person of His Son, Jesus Christ, God tabernacled in a body of flesh, that was a little too much for them to--to understand. But He said, \"Now, as you have believed in God, believe also in Me. For in My Father's house are many mansions, and I go to prepare a place for you.\" Jesus' life was fixing to end, here on earth. He had showed the people, and proved to them, that He was Jehovah manifested in flesh, by the great signs and wonders, and the reference of the Bible that He had referred to, to Himself. And He proved that He was God, manifested. Now He said, \"When you see My life ending, it's ending for a purpose. And I'm going away, to prepare a place for you; that where I am, there you may be also.\" Jesus therefore is telling His disciples that this life is not ended in death. [John 14:2-3]\n\nL-23 Now, saying this was a funeral text. Remember, we, death sets right before us, and we don't know whether there may be some in this building tonight will not go out of here alive, in this physical life. That's how uncertain it is. Five minutes from now, it could be that young, healthy, young people in this building can be a corpse in five minutes from now. That is true. And again, it could be, in five minutes from now, we'd every one be in Glory. We just don't know. That's in the hands of God. Jesus said He didn't know, Hisself, when that time would be, but, \"That was in the hands of the Father only.\"\n\nL-24 Now, but, He was telling them, that, after death there is life. Because, \"I go and prepare a place,\" that is, to receive them, shows that there, He was speaking to them, that there was a--a life after this life is ended. And what a consolation that ought to give to all of us, to know that, after this life is over, there is a life, that we go into. And as you get older, that becomes more of a reality to you. As you begin to see the days of your life drawing close, then it begins to, you begin to pack up closer, getting ready for that great event. It's now... It's a continuing of this same life in another world, another place. [John 14:2-3]\n\nL-25 Your birth here was pre-planned. I guess you believe that. Every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned. Did you know that your being here never originated just at a myth or a thought? Everything was all pre-planned by God, before the foundation of the world, that you would be here. The infinite God knowed. And to be--to be infinite, He had to know every flea that ever would be in the earth, and how many times it would bat its eye. That's infinite. See? You, our little--our little minds, cannot fathom what infinite means. The infinite God, He knowed all things. Therefore, there's nothing out of cater. [Romans 8:29-30], [Ephesians 1:4, 11]\n\nL-26 If we know the Word of God, we know where we are living. We know the hour that we're living in. We know 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min what lays ahead. We see what we've passed. And the Book of God is the revelation of Jesus Christ; His works through the ages, that was up to the book of Revelation, and then His promises that is to come. So, all of His promises are true. God cannot speak any Word without It being confirmed. Every Word that He says has to come to pass. Before the foundation of the world... [Isaiah 55:11], [II Samuel 7:28], [Mark 13:31]\n\nL-27 Some people mix Genesis up, there, when he said, \"God repeats Himself.\" No. Just, you're misunderstanding. See? God, at the beginning, He said, \"Let there be. Let there be. Let there be.\" The world was just dark, in a chaos. Even when He said, \"Let there be light,\" there might have been hundreds of years before light ever sprung in. But when He spoke it, it has to come to pass. It must be that way. See? And He spoke His Word. Them seeds was beneath the water. When He dried off the earth, then the seeds come up. What He says must come to pass. [Genesis 1:3]\n\nL-28 He said, through the prophets. I referred to it last evening. Like, we take Isaiah, he said, \"A virgin shall conceive.\" Who would think, of a man that was thought of among people, to say such a word as that, \"A virgin shall conceive\"? But because he... A prophet is a reflector of God. He is made so that he cannot speak his own words. It has to be God's Words that he speaks. He's just like a reflector, and he is God's mouthpiece. And so, therefore, he said, \"A virgin shall conceive.\" He probably could not understand it, but God had spoke it through him. Because, He promised that, \"He would do nothing until He revealed It to His servants the prophets.\" Then, when he said that, it was eight hundred years before that ever come to pass. But it had to come to pass. Finally, those Words of God anchored in the womb of a virgin, and she conceived and brought forth Emmanuel. \"Unto us a--a Child is born, unto us a Son is given. His Name shall be called, 'The Counsellor,' 'The mighty God,' 'The Prince of Peace,' 'The everlasting Father.'\" That had to be that way, because God had spoke it through the mouth of His prophets. And all the Words of God has to be fulfilled. Therefore, we know that Jesus has gone to prepare a place, to receive a people unto Himself. Who those people are, I hope it's we are part of those people tonight. If it isn't, my friend, God has made a way, a condition, that you can be included in that if you want to. You're on free moral agency. You can act the way you wish to. But now notice, now, in this world that is to come. There is a world to come. [Isaiah 7:14], [Matthew 1:23], [Amos 3:7], [Isaiah 9:6]\n\nL-29 Just like your birth here, I said, you was prepared. God knew you would be here. And now you know, even things that your parents done, now, people think that that isn't visit from generation to generation, but it is.\n\nL-30 Over in the Book of Hebrews, I believe, about the 7th chapter, speaking, Paul there, the writers, I believe it was, was speaking on a--a great event that taken place with Abraham, that he paid tithes to Melchisedek, when he was returning from the slaughter of the king. And now he said, that, \"Levi was in the loins of Abraham, when he met Melchisedek, coming from the slaughter of the kings.\" And then he reckoned that to \"Levi paying tithes, also, when he was in the loins of Abraham,\" his great-great-grandfather. And He visits the sins of the people upon their--their children, from generation to generation, that won't keep His Word. See? [Exodus 34:7], [Hebrews 7:9-10]\n\nL-31 You were all pre-planned by God. Nothing happens by chance, with God. He knows all about it. It's all pre-planned, planned for many generations back, so that you could be here tonight. Did you know that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Just think, that, you, at one time... I'll repeat this again. You, at one time, was in your father, in the gene of your father. Now, he didn't know you at that time, neither did you know him at that time. But, you see, then you were put in the bedding ground, in the womb of mother, through holy wedlock. And then you become a person expressed in the image like your father, then there's fellowship.\n\nL-32 Now, the only way that you can be a son, a daughter of God, because you have to be the... have to have Eternal Life. And there's only one form of Eternal Life, and that's God's Life. Only one form of Eternal Life, that was God. There, to be a son of God, you had to be in Him always. The gene of your Life, spiritual Life, tonight, was in God, the Father, before there was even a molecule. See? And you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of Life that was 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min in God, as a son of God. Now you're expressed, after His Word has come in you, to Light up this age. You are expressing God's Life in you, because you are a son or a daughter of God. Therefore, you get what I mean? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] See? You are in... You are now made, you're setting in this church, tonight, because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people, and this neighborhood where you associate. Wherever you are, God knew that you would be here, because you have to be one of His genes, or His attributes. You had to be. If you ever, if you've got Eternal Life, then It always was Eternal Life. And God, before there was a foundation, world, knew that you would be here. And when the Word, or the water, \"the washing of the water of the Word\" fell upon you--you, it was expressed in a being. Now you have fellowship with your Father, God, just as you have with your earthly father. See? You are citizens of the King; not citizens, but you are children, sons and daughters of the living God, if it be that the Eternal Life dwells in you. 32a Now, then, if It was, Jesus was the fullness of God manifested. He was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Therefore, when He came to the earth and was manifested in flesh, you were here in Him then, because He was the Word. \"In the beginning was the Word; the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\" The Word was made flesh. Therefore, you walked with Him, when you were in Him, when He was on earth. You suffered with Him, and you died with Him. You was buried with Him. And now you are risen with Him, and manifested attributes of God, setting in Heavenly places; already raised, resurrected to new Life, and setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Oh, that means so much, now days, Church! That means so much to us, to see ourself positionally placed in Jesus Christ! [Ephesians 5:26], [Colossians 2:9-10], [John 1:1, 14], [Ephesians 2:6]\n\nL-33 Now, if we are those attributes of God, we cannot live by creeds. We cannot live by denominationalism. We must live by the Word, because the Bride is a part of the Bridegroom, like any wife is a part of her husband. Therefore, we must be that Word Bride. And what is that Word Bride? The manifestation of this hour, the Bride, not a creed or a denomination; but a living oracle of God, a living attribute of God, displaying to the world the attributes of God, in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living.\n\nL-34 Martin Luther could not express the attributes that we express, because that that was in the beginning, the resurrection, like the corn of wheat that went into the earth.\n\nL-35 Now, we quote this again. You probably read that book, that German making fun of me, and said I was a fanatic of all the fanatics. He was--he was absolutely against everything that's called God, and even made fun of God. Said, \"A God that could open the Red Sea and,\" said, \"take His people out; and set with His hands across His tummy, and let (through the dark ages) all those people die and suffer, those little children be eat by lions.\"\n\nL-36 You see, the whole--whole program, the whole Church, is built upon Divine revelation. Jesus said, in Saint Matthew, the 16th chapter, \"Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father which is in Heaven has revealed this to you.\" What was it? A revelation of who He was. \"And upon this Rock, I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell can't prevail against It.\" See? The revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour; not what He was in another hour! What He was now, the Bible expresses. It's growing in the Bride, to the full stature. Therefore, if the corn of wheat, of Christ, had to fall in the ground, so did the Bride have to fall in the ground, through the dark ages. Any grain that goes in the ground must die, or it can't produce itself, reproduce itself. And the great Church that He established on the Day of Pentecost, by the sending of the Holy Ghost, had to suffer martyrdom and go into the dirt, into the earth in the dark age, to bring forth again in the age of Luther, and come on out to the full stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ for this last day. See? There's no way... [Matthew 16:17-18]\n\nL-37 Therefore, the Bride, in the Rapture, will come forth. And there is all pre-planned by God, all backed up. From the beginning, He knowed every man, every place, who would set, all about it. It's all pre-planned. God knew it would be here. And--and when... He made it that way, so that when we get there... He's gone to prepare a place for us. And when we get there, it'll all be prepared just like even this night is prepared, like this hour is prepared. Yes. His great foreknowledge tells Him all these things, by foreknowledge. [John 14:2-3] 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min\n\nL-38 He's omnipresent because He's omniscient; omniscient because He's omnipresent. Therefore, by His foreknowledge... Now, He can't be just like the wind over the earth, because He is a Being. He just isn't a myth. He's a Being. He dwells. He even dwells in a house. He dwells in a place called Heaven. And therefore, by His omni-, being omnipresent; being omniscient, knowing all things, then He is omnipresent because He knows all things.\n\nL-39 You, now, you grew from your birth, when you was born and presented into this world. God knew that you were going to be here in this earth, and you growed from birth to maturity. Things that seemed so strange to you, in your young womanhood, young boyhood, as children, now seems very real. You couldn't understand it when you was a child. But now, as you become adult, you begin to understand and find out that everything was just set just right. And, you, it really means something to you now. [I Corinthians 13:11]\n\nL-40 So is it in your spiritual birth. You do things that you don't understand, when you're a little baby, come to the altar. You give your life to Christ. You do such strange things. You wonder why you did it. But after while, when you mature, as matured Christians, then you understand it. See? There's something picks up. You see why you had to do it. Your spiritual birth! Your natural birth types your spiritual. How--how it fitted to you, in this life, as you grew, everything fitted right in, because you were made for that. Wasn't it a strange thing, the night that you staggered into the mission, the tent meeting, or the little church somewhere on the corner, and something the preacher preached on, a certain subject, and you just fell right at the altar? See? See? God knew that, before the foundation of the world. See? It--it seemed strange to you, why you did it then. But now you understand; you knew what happened. It's so fitting to you in this life, and will be also in the Life that is to come. This world and its life seems to--to advance as you mature. Everything seems to go right with you. [Ephesians 1:4]\n\nL-41 I don't believe in a... that a person just happened to be here by chance. Now just think, when you come to the--the world, everything had to be fore-prepared for you, or pre-prepared, rather, for you. I don't hardly understand that how that we could think that a God that could prepare all these good things for us would not... we could not put trust in Him. That, if He brought us in this chaos that we're in now, and prepared the good things of life for us here, how much more can we trust Him to prepare the things that is to come, see, the Eternal things! It seems, I say, very strange. [I Corinthians 2:9], [John 14:2-3]\n\nL-42 And I--I do not think that Heaven is a place that my mother used to tell me about. I believe that the Church has growed from that. To think, it used to be, a hundred years ago, or two, I think the old-timers used to think that everyone that died went up to Heaven and had a harp, and--and set up there on the clouds and--and played a harp. Now, they knowed that there was a place called Heaven. But, they, if that be so, all the musicians would have it on us, you see. But we... But it--it isn't that kind of a place. It isn't playing harps, at all. I believe, don't believe the Bible teaches that. But that was a conception that they had before the fullness of the Word come into existence, or the opening of the Seven Seals, that's promised to us in this age, that we then understand. I believe that Heaven is a real place, just the same as this is a real place, see, for God started us in our spiritual growth in this place. And I believe that Heaven is a place just as real as this, where we don't set up there for Eternity and just set there on a cloud. We don't just strum our harp, for all--all from here, ever. But we're going to a real place where we're going to do things, where we're going to live. We're going to work. We're going to enjoy. We're going to live. We're going to Life, to a real Eternal Life. We're going to a Heaven, a paradise. Just like Adam and Eve worked, and lived, and eat, and enjoyed, in the garden of Eden before sin came in, we're on our road right back there again, right, right back. The first Adam, through sin, taken us out. The Second Adam, through righteousness, bring us back in again; justifies us and brings us back in. [Genesis 2:8, 10, 15]\n\nL-43 You people that take the tapes now, the message of justification, I want you take it. And you do take the tapes, I want you to get that. I spoke on it, here some time ago.\n\nL-44 Look how your earthly parent, before you come here, before they knowed you was coming, made ready for your coming. Just think of that now, your earthly parents. Which, an earthly parent is only a type of a heavenly Parent. \"If we know how to give good gifts to our children, how much more does your Heavenly Father know how to give good gifts to His children.\" Jesus spoke these Words. See? 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min They made ready your coming. They made a little crib, or got a little, some little booties, and little clothes, and so forth. They made ready, everything for you to arrive, prepared before you even come on the earth. [Matthew 7:11], [Luke 11:11-13], [John 14:1-3]\n\nL-45 Jesus has gone to make ready our coming there. Now notice. \"In My Father's House is many mansions.\" Or, let us... I don't mean to add to the Word, or take from It, because we're not to do that. Revelations 22 said, \"Whoever will add a word, or take a Word out of It.\" But let me just make this, as not an additive, but just to--to bring out a point. \"In My Father's House is many kinds of mansions.\" I don't believe that when we get to Heaven that we will be, just everybody look just exactly alike. I don't believe that--that all will be blondes, or brunettes, or--or little, or--or all big, or--or all giants. I believe that God is a God of variety. The world proves that. He's got big mountains and little mountains. He's got plains. He's got deserts. He's got different things, because He made it the way He wanted it. And He made the seasons; summer, winter, spring, autumn. He made the seasons. It shows He's a God of variety. He made you in a variety. Some men are real blusterous; and some are real dogmatic; and others are fine; others are kind. And you just find all different kinds of people, and in His Kingdom. See? [John 14:2], [Revelation 22:18-19], [Genesis 1:14]\n\nL-46 Look at Saint Peter, and judge him by Andrew. See? Andrew is that prayer warrior, just stayed on his knees all the time. And the apostle Peter was one of those firebrands that preached, and--and so forth. And Paul was more scholarly-like, more of the... like the prophet, or something, and set back.\n\nL-47 And, see, Moses wrote the first four Books of the Old. Which, he wrote the Old Testament. The rest of it was the laws, and kings, and psalms, and so forth, and what someone wrote of the prophets. But Moses wrote the laws, the first four Books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy.\n\nL-48 And then Paul wrote the New Testament. That's true. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John wrote the acts of what taken place, and so forth. But Paul separated law and grace, and put it into its place. See? He was the writer of the New Testament. He gave us the writings of the New Testament, setting the Word of God in order. Now notice, many, \"many mansions,\" many kinds of mansions.\n\nL-49 Like, many kinds of hills; like, many kinds of rivers, springs, lakes. They were here when you come here, first, because the kindness of your Heavenly Father placed them here. Because, some men likes mountains. Some people likes waters. Some likes deserts. So, you see, your coming, He knew your nature and what you would be, so He made it just the way that you could enjoy it. Oh! I think that's a wonderful Father, see, know that He made it like this. I'm glad He made mountains. I--I like the mountains. I... And I--I like that. Where, the others, \"Oh, I can't stand... Oh, He must have emptied His mortar box out there.\" Well, He emptied it out so I could enjoy it. You see? So then say, \"I like the plains, where I can see a long ways.\" Well, the two different natures, both of us Christians. But the Father knew that you would be here, and prepared everything for you before you got here. Amen. Your first coming, here, He had it ready for you when you got here. Isn't that marvelous to think of what He done?\n\nL-50 Now, now, but remember, these are only temporal gifts, in type. \"Now, we know that Moses, in building the tabernacle in the wilderness, or preparing it, he said he made all things after the order of what he saw in Heaven.\" See? So, the earthly things only express what the Eternal things are. And if this earth that we live in today, being so great, as we love it; and love to live, and breathe the air, and see the flowers and things; if--if that, if this here is the expression, one that's dying is only expressing one that's Eternal. When you see a tree struggling, pulling, trying to live, that means there's a tree somewhere that doesn't have to do that. When you see a man here, struggling to live, somebody in a hospital, or on a sick bed, or in a accident, struggling, and the death rattle is in their throat, and pulling, and crying, and screaming for life, what does that mean? There's a place, somewhere, there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that. See? It just doesn't do it. [Exodus 25:9]\n\nL-51 Now, they are temporal gifts to us, these things, only expressing that there is One where it's the Eternal One. That's what Jesus has gone away to prepare, the Eternal One for us. Now, they only express there's a greater of the same kind, 'cause these are a same kind. [II Corinthians 4:18] 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min\n\nL-52 Now, remember, the Bible said, \"If this earthly tabernacle of our dwelling, if it perish, be dissolved, we have one already waiting.\" Just as the little baby, its little muscles, in the mother, are twisting and turning. And, but just... See? And you notice, you can take a woman, if she is ever so foul; but when she's become a mother, a little while before that baby is born, there's a kindness about the woman. Get around her, there's always something, she's more tender. Why? There's a little angel spirit waiting to receive that natural body. Just as soon as it's born, the breath of life comes into it. And God breathes it in there, and it becomes a living soul. Now, just as this baby is being born, then the spiritual body is there to receive it. And now, when this body is dropped here, in this earth, like the baby is dropped, also there is a immortal body waiting to receive the spirit back into itself again. Oh, what a great thing! We are--we are now in Christ Jesus, (amen), babies, babes in Christ, children of God, waiting for the full deliverance, at the Coming of our Lord Jesus, the... to receive us up unto Hisself, when the body, this mortal, will take on immortality. [II Corinthians 5:1-2]\n\nL-53 The likeness, all the things that He did, expresses the things that are to come. Just as the body gives you here, just as this body, He gave you to live in, only expresses that there is one that is greater, yet, to come. See? \"If we bear, or have borne the image of the earthly, we also shall bear the image of the Heavenly,\" which holds no evils in this one that is to come. Now, this one does hold evil, sickness, death, sorrow. I've just expressed here, not long ago, preaching on The Transformation Of The Word Of God, of how that--that this body, it's got the evil in it. [I Corinthians 15:48-50]\n\nL-54 And all this modern civilization that we live in is of the Devil. You don't believe that? The Bible says it is; this world, every government. We don't want to believe that. But the Bible plainly states it, that every government, every kingdom of the earth, is owned by the Devil and ruled by the Devil. Jesus was taken by Satan, up, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world that was, would be, what more. And Satan claimed them, his, and Jesus never argued with him, because he is the god of this world. See? And he said, \"I'll give them to You if You'll fall down and worship me.\" See? He was trying to give them over to Jesus, without sacrifice. See? It was a bargain he was going to make Him. But the world had sinned. So, the penalty of sin was death, and He had to die. That's why God was manifested in flesh, so He could take death on Him, to pay the penalty. There's nothing to come back. It's not earmarked. It's absolutely, freely paid. All the debt is paid. It belongs to Him now. And we are delegates of His Kingdom, assembled here together tonight, in the Name of Jesus Christ our King, setting in Heavenly places. [Matthew 4:8-9], [Romans 6:23], [Ephesians 1:3], [Ephesians 2:6]\n\nL-55 Now, in this world that we live in, this education. I want to prove to you. Education, science, civilization, and all these things that we seemingly so enjoy today, is of Satan, and will perish. You say, \"Brother Branham, civilization?\" Yes, sir. This civilization come by Satan. Genesis 4 proves it. Cain's son, see, started this civilization, building cities, and organs, and so forth. And civilization came by knowledge. Knowledge is what the Devil sold Eve, in the garden of Eden, that caused her to cramp, transgress God's commandment. So there will be a civilization in the world that we're going to, but it won't be this kind of a civilization, for in this civilization we have sickness, sorrow, lust, death, everything in this civilization, wrong. But in that civilization there will be none of these things. We won't need science. Science is the perversion of the original, anyhow. See? You split a molecule, to split atoms and do so-and-so, to blow you up. You take gun powder, bang this, to kill something. You take the car. And take gasoline out of the earth, and the materials out of the earth, to loosen up the fibers, so it can blow up. And go down the road at ninety miles an hour, and kill somebody. See? Oh, so nervous, squeeze, and hurry up; we got to push, and taking. Oh! See? It's all of the Devil. The Kingdom of God will not have automobiles, airplanes, or any scientific achievements. No. It won't have any education, at all. It'll be an education so supreme to this, that this won't even be thought of. See? Education, civilization, and all this, comes from Satan. Now, you say, \"Brother Branham, why do you read, then?\" [Genesis 4:16-17, 21-23]\n\nL-56 See, just like, why do I wear clothes now? In the civilization that was to come, that was first, they didn't need any clothes. They were veiled. They had no reason to wear clothes, 'cause they didn't know they were naked. Now you... 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min Now you find out, that, in now, then, that we know that we are--are--are--are naked, sin abides here, then we've got to wear clothes. But it wasn't so at the beginning; there was no sin. See? [Genesis 3:10, 11, 21]\n\nL-57 Now, the same thing is in the way of civilization, altogether. We read. We write. We do this. But don't never get adjusted to that. Don't never make that your god, for that is the god of communism. See? It's not of Jesus Christ.\n\nL-58 Jesus Christ is by faith; not what you can scientifically prove, but what you believe. I can't scientifically prove you, tonight, in this building, that there is a God, but yet I know He's here. But, by my faith, vindicates it. Abraham could not scientifically prove to you that he was going to have a baby to that woman, and her nearly a hundred years. But his faith confirmed it. See? Didn't need any scientific proof. Why, the... Why, the doctor would said, \"The old man is crazy, out here saying he's going to have a--a baby by that woman; him a hundred years old, and her ninety.\" But, you see, God said so, so it don't take science. It takes faith, to believe God's Word, not science. [Galatians 2:16], [Galatians 3:22, 26], [Romans 4:3, 19-20]\n\nL-59 So, our schools and things are a blow up. As, God never said, \"Go forth and make schools,\" or even, \"have Bible schools.\" You know that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] He said, \"Preach the Word.\" That's exactly right. Our educational systems taken us farther away from God than anything I know of, that's right, farther away from God. Not build schools, hospitals, and so forth; that was for the world and for that group. But, I ain't got nothing against them; they play their parts, but that still is not that. We build a hospital, ever so good, and practice with the best medicine we got, and thousands die in it daily. But, oh, my, in the Kingdom of God, there is no death, there is no sorrow. Amen. There's no need of these things of the world. But we've passed from this thing, into the realities of God; where we struggle so hard to try to find, through science. And more scientific we get, more death we bring on ourselves. We're fighting a losing battle there, so turn loose of it. And by faith, believe Jesus Christ the Son of God, tonight, and accept Him. He is the One.\n\nL-60 What is science preparing for you? More death. That's right. Sputniks and everything going up, all these things, to scatter death and everything across the earth. Don't look to that. Turn your head higher than that, towards Heaven. Look where Jesus sets, \"On the right hand of God,\" tonight, \"ever living to make intercessions on our confession.\" Of what? We believe His Word to be the Truth. [Romans 8:26-27], [Hebrews 7:25]\n\nL-61 Now, we find, this life holds all kinds of evils, so therefore the life that is to come won't have it. This one has lust, and sickness, death. Because, what is it? It's not the house that He's gone to prepare. This is a pesthouse. How many knows what a pesthouse is? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Sure. Well, that's what you're living in. A pesthouse is where they put all the diseased people. Well, that's just what sin done to us, put us in an earthly pesthouse. Were you... They wouldn't let anyone else come in the pesthouse, because there's all kinds of germs flying around in there, and--and the people will take these germs and--and be sick, themself. And sin brought us into the Devil's pesthouse. [II Corinthians 5:1-4]\n\nL-62 Oh, but the other one is called, \"My Father's House.\" \"I'll go and prepare a place for you. Take you out of this pesthouse and deliver you into My Father's House.\" Amen. There you are; take you out of this old earthly pesthouse. He's gone to prepare a place, a perfect place where no evil exists, no sickness exists, no old age exists, no death exists. It's a perfect place calling you to that perfection, and you have to be perfect to get there. The Bible said so. Jesus said, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect.\" It's a perfect Kingdom, so it must be a perfect people come. Because, you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God, and you must be a perfect Bride. So how can you do it through anything else but the perfect Word of God, which is, \"The Waters of separation, that washes us from our sins\"? Amen. That's right. The Blood of Jesus Christ, think of It, the dripping, Bloody Word. Amen. The Blood, the--the Word of God bleeding Blood, to wash the Bride in. Amen. Yes, sir. She stands perfect, virgin, unadulterated. She never sinned, in the first place. Amen. She was trapped into it. See? There's the Father's House that He's gone to prepare. [John 14:2-3], [II Corinthians 5:1-4], [II Corinthians 13:11], [Colossians 1:14, 28], [James 1:4], [Romans 5:9], [Ephesians 5:26]\n\nL-63 This one come by sex, and from the fall, and must fall with the fall. No matter how much you patch the old thing up, she's going to fall, anyhow. She's done, because she's doomed, because God said so. She is finished. God is going 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min to destroy it. He said so. There'll be a renovation of the whole thing. You believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] In the beginning, when the world had its birth, when God pulled back the water, first, off the earth, like He did the water from the mother's womb, there was a world born. Yes. And peoples begin to live on it when God put them on there. And then they begin to sin. And it was baptized, by immersing, in the days of Noah. Then it was sanctified by the Blood of the Creator dropping upon it. And now that's the way you come, through justification, to believe God. You were baptized unto repent, or, too, for the remission of your sins. You confessed your sins before God, and He forgave you for it. And you was baptized, to show that you had been, you had been forgiven; confessing to the people, and showing to the world, that you believe that Jesus Christ died for you. And you... He took your place, and now you stand in His place. He become you, that you might become Him. Then the sanctifying power of God cleansed all the habits out of your life. You used to smoke, drink, do things that wasn't right, tell lies, everything. Then the sanctifying power of the Blood of Jesus Christ comes into your life and takes all the things away from you. If you happen to say something's not wrong, quickly say, \"Wait a minute. Pardon me. I didn't mean to say it like that.\" See? The Devil got a trap setting there. But you got grace to come back, if you're a real Christian, say, \"I was wrong.\" Yes. So, therefore, now, the... [Acts 2:38], [Luke 3:3], [Luke 24:47]\n\nL-64 Now, the next thing you receive, was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire. Now, God, when this Millennium is over, God is going to give the world a baptism of fire. It's going to blow the whole thing up. \"The heavens and earth will be on fire.\" Peter said so. And the thing will have a baptism of fire, renovation of the whole thing. And then there'll be a new heavens and a new earth. That's, when, where dwelleth righteousness. That's where we are. We have become from mortal beings, from time beings, to Eternal beings. When the Word of God lit our souls, and we become sons and daughters of God, with the attributes, the gene of God in us, to be sons and daughters of the Father, God in Heaven, crying, \"Abba, Father! My God, my God, in my Father's House.\" [John 14:2]\n\nL-65 Now, this old world must fall, because it come through sex. And it come through disobedience, in the beginning. And we was born here through sex, through the fall, and it must go right back the same way, to the fall. But the one He is now preparing for you, cannot fall, because He is making it so. \"I've gone...\" What if we just had to stay in this kind of a body? Aren't you glad there's such a thing as death? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Now isn't that strange? But now, say, for instance... A few years ago, I was a little boy, and now I'm a middle-aged man. I got a friend setting right there, Mr. Dauch, and he's ninety-three years old, a few days ago. Look at him now. Forty or forty-five more years, that would be me. Now put another forty years on him. Where would you go? The only... [Genesis 3:6-7], [II Corinthians 5:1-4]\n\nL-66 I'm glad that there's something to get us out of this pesthouse. There's an open door, and it's called death. Jesus stands in that door. Amen. He'll guide me over the river. He'll take me through that door. There's a great door standing yonder, called death. And every time your heart beats, you're one beat closer to it. And some day I must come to that door. You must come there. But when I come there, I don't want to be a coward. I don't want to scream and back off. I want to come to that door, wrap myself in the robes of His righteousness (not mine), His. By this I know, that, \"I know Him in the power of His resurrection.\" That, when He calls, I'll come out from among the dead, to be with Him, out of this pesthouse. Wherever this body might fall, and wherever it might land, whatever it is, I'll come out someday, because He promised It to me. And we believe it. Yes, sir. He's making One that cannot fall. [Philippians 3:10]\n\nL-67 Notice how the expecting mother, on earth today, how the mother's body craves for certain things. I'm speaking, I guess and hope, to all the adults that will understand. The mother, in the birth of the baby, if there's something lacking in her body, she begins to crave certain thing. Look how dad... I remember we was raised, such a poor family, and--and we didn't have hardly anything to eat when we were kids. Many of you suffered that same thing. So how that, when, before the babies would be born, mother would crave something. And dad would just pinch corners, everything, to get it for her. See? It's her, the body, her body, the calcium and so forth of her body, and the vitamins 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min that she needs. Junie is being made up, see, and he craves for things, foods for the coming child. And how, the parents, they try to get it so the baby will be born as perfectly and happy as possible. See how your parents will do that? When there's something needed, the mother gives witness of it, see, her system is made up. You understand? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] That, how that when there's something needed here, to the oncoming child, the--the mother begins to crave for that.\n\nL-68 Now, stop just a minute. Why we have revivals? Why do we assemble ourselves together? Why am I always rebuking the people? Why am I calling you Pentecostal women, \"Quit wearing paints, make-up, and bobbing your hair, and stuff like that\"? Why am I saying that? Because, the old-fashion way of pentecost used to not do that. The real Bible way is not to do that. You wearing these shorts and clothes that pertains to men, do you know the Bible says that that's an abomination to God? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] But we permit it. Why does the Holy Spirit keep crying out? It knows there's something lacking there. We must be in the full stature of Jesus Christ. We must be sons and daughters of God. We must act like God's children. [Hebrews 10:25], [Deuteronomy 22:5], [Ezekiel 23:40], [Jeremiah 4:30], [II Kings 9:30], [I Corinthians 11:1-5], [Ephesians 4:13]\n\nL-69 Long ago, a little story was told. I noticed one colored brother setting in the back. In the South, they used to sell slaves. And this, when they had slaves down there, when slavery was, before the emancipation, of the proclamation. And they would go by and buy them, them people, just like they would a--a used car, dealer. They had a bill of sales, and sold them human beings just like they were--they were used cars. You got a bill of sales with them.\n\nL-70 One time a buyer come by, a broker. And he was going to... He'd go around these big plantations and buy slaves. And he come to a certain big plantation where they had many slaves, and he wanted to see how many they had. And there was all of them out there, working. And they--they were sad. They were away from home. They was from Africa. They had brought them over here. The Boers had brought them over and sold them for slaves, and so they were sad. They know they'd never go back home again. They'd live and die in the land. And they had, many times, they'd carry whips and whip them. They were property of the owner, and he did with them what he wanted to. And they just... If he killed it, he killed it. And if he, whatever it was, he just did it. That's slavery, like Israel was, and--and many of the nations had been brought into slavery. And they'd have to take them poor slaves. They just served. They were crying, you know, all time, and sad.\n\nL-71 But they noticed one of them slaves, young fellow, he had his chest stuck out, his head up like that. Never had to whip him. Never had to tell him what to do. So that broker said, \"I want to buy that slave.\" He said, \"He's not for sale.\" He said, \"I would like to buy him.\" He said, \"No. He's not for sale.\" Said, \"Is he the boss of the rest of them?\" Said, \"No.\" Said, \"He's not the boss. He is slave.\" He said, \"Well, maybe you feed him different than you feed the rest of them.\" Said, \"No. They all eat out there in the galley, together.\" He said, \"What makes that boy so much different than the rest of them?\" He said, \"Here is one thing. I wondered for a while, too. But that boy, an alien from Africa, but in Africa his father is the king of the tribe. And, yet, he's an alien away from home. He conducts himself as a king's son. He knows that, across the land, that his father is the king of the tribe. And now he conducts himself, because he knows he's the son of a king.\"\n\nL-72 Oh, brother, sister, you and I, in this world that we live, let's conduct ourselves as sons and daughters of God. We're aliens here, but our behavior ought to be according to the commandments of God, that we are sons and daughters of God. Our behavior, we should act and do, and everything, according to what the laws that God laid down. \"And it's an abomination for a women to wear a garment that pertains to a man.\" It's wrong and sinful, \"For her to cut her hair,\" the Bible said so, \"uncommon thing for her to even pray.\" You say, \"What about this?\" [Deuteronomy 22:5], [Romans 12:2], [I John 3:1-2], [Galatians 4:6], [I Corinthians 11:15] 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min\n\nL-73 Someone got after me; a great, noted minister, not long ago. Said, \"Brother Branham, come. I want to lay hands on you.\" Said, \"You're going to ruin your ministry.\" I said, \"What?\" Said, \"Bawling them people out like that.\" I said, \"I'm telling the...\" Said, \"I believe that.\" Said, \"I'm a Pentecostal, too. I believe that women shouldn't wear short hair, shouldn't wear paints, and these things like that the way they do, paint their faces up.\" Said, \"They shouldn't do that. But,\" said, \"God called you to pray for the sick.\" I said, \"He called me to preach the Gospel.\" Yeah. And he said, \"I believe in that. But,\" said, \"you think that?\" I said, \"Yeah. Look what you got, all these big programs, televisions, and everything else. I ain't got nothing but God to answer to.\" That's right. I said, \"I don't have nothing but God to answer to.\" He said, \"I--I--I... You're going to ruin your ministry.\" I said, \"Any ministry that the Word of God will ruin, ought to be ruined.\" That's right. Certainly. That's exactly. He said, \"Well, you're going to ruin it.\" [Deuteronomy 22:5], [I Corinthians 11:5, 6, 15]\n\nL-74 I said, \"Who is going to tell It then? See? Somebody has got to say It. Somebody has got to stand for that what's Truth, no matter what It hurts.\" And friends, as Christian, as people that believe we're going to Heaven, the Holy Spirit Itself will type us in the Word of God. He said, \"You know what you ought to do?\" Said, \"People believe you to be a prophet.\" Said, \"You ought to be teaching these women how to get gifts of prophecy and things like that, and great, higher things instead of little thing.\"\n\nL-75 I said, \"How am I going to teach them algebra when they won't even learn their ABC's? When they won't even do the common thing, see, the natural thing, how you going to tell them high things?\" When you won't even start from the... You want to get on top the ladder before you hit the first. That's the reason you fall. See? But get at the bottom, and climb right on up as God leads you up. See? Cope your life and ever follow every bit of the Word that God has ordained for you to do.\n\nL-76 Now think how that God... We should behave ourselves and act like Christians. Our conduct should be like Christians. Because, we are aliens here. This is not our Home. No. We were just put here, temporarily. We've got to go, every one of us, tonight.\n\nL-77 Now think. If God, in His mercy, has the mother, before the little baby is born, it's craving for some vitamin, and the mother's words speaks forth, \"Dad, I--I--I want cantaloupe, or watermelon. I want something, another.\" It's out of... Why, he'll do everything he can, to get that, because he knows that he wants his child born as perfect as it can be. See? And he'll do everything that he's able to do, to get it. , [Galatians 4:16]\n\nL-78 How much more able-er is He, to get it! He's a Creator. Now think how able He is, to prepare us a body, to live like His Own glorious body, if we want to live. There is something in us, calls, to live. And there is something in us that calls to do right. Then God will call somebody on the platform, or the pulpit, that will preach the absolute Truth. Why? See? It shows you. Then, if you're a real child of God, you begin to cry out, \"God, take it away from me. Circumcise me from this. Take these things away from me.\" Why? It's needed for your heavenly Home that you're going to, where He's gone on to prepare. You got to be a real Word Bride of Christ. [Philippians 3:21], [John 8:32], [Romans 9:1], [Galatians 2:5], [Galatians 4:16]\n\nL-79 I was preaching a few nights ago on the sacrifice, in the days of the atonement. I was preaching on the only place that God, the only Church that God will meet a man in, and that's in, He said, the place that He put His Name. He said, \"I won't meet them in any other place but the place, the gate that I put My Name in.\" Now, He don't meet you in the Methodist gate, Baptist gate, or Pentecostal gate, or any of them. But He put His Name in His Son. He said, \"I came in My Father's Name.\" Any man comes, and any child, comes in his father's name. He... I come in the name of a Branham, because my father was a Branham. And you come in your name because that was your father's name. 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min And Jesus, the Son, came in the Father's Name. And He said He put his Name, \"In this gate that I put My Name in, that was the sacrifice.\" And in Jesus Christ is the only place that you'll ever find fellowship and worship to God. You say, \"Well, I belong to the church.\" That don't make one thing different. You've got to be in Christ. A certain denominational minister, the other night, said to me, said, \"Mr. Branham, look here. Jesus said, 'Whosoever believeth.' The Bible said, 'Whosoever believeth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, is born of the Spirit of God.'\" [Leviticus 23:27-28], [Psalms 118:19], [John 5:43]\n\nL-80 I said, \"Don't the Bible also say, that, 'No man can call Jesus the Christ, only by the Holy Ghost'?\" See? You can't make the Bible lie. It's got to hook right in. So you have to become absolutely born again, of the Holy Spirit in you, that witness out, yourself, you know that He is the Son of God. And then if you are, and a part; if you are a child of God, in the Word of God; how can you deny the Word? How can the Holy Spirit make you believe a creed, that you have to do something like this, when the Bible said something else? \"We have to join a church, and do this, or do that,\" when the Bible plainly tells you what to do? See? And then when you see That, and you jump right into It, you're right with It then. Just keep moving right on up, and just grows. Like a--a--a germ coming into the womb of a woman with the egg. And then when that little egg begins to develop, and begin to bring forth germs, it don't put one human germ, and a dog germ, and a cow germ. It puts all human germ. [I Corinthians 12:3]\n\nL-81 And when a child of God, when that predestinated... That's a bad word to use, but it's God. Here is God's Bible. The foreknowledge of God can predestinate, make everything work to His honor. When that predestinated seed, that you was to be, and God called you, and that little eagle of a seed in there heard the Word of God, it will build on top, one Word on top the other one, on top the other one, on top the other one. It'll not mix with any creed.\n\nL-82 Notice. \"In these gates, every day, they should eat new kosher. And there would be no leaven found among them, through the seven days.\" Is that right? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] The seven church ages, then, no unleaven, no creed, no nothing added. It has to be absolutely unleaven bread. \"No leaven shall be found among you, at all.\" Just a leaven, the Word Itself, that's the only. And that Word is God. And God was made flesh, in the Person of Jesus Christ, which, that is the Gate. \"There is the Gate I meet you in, to worship, when you follow the commandments of God.\" [Exodus 12:15], [John 1:14]\n\nL-83 Therefore, if you've, tonight, just come, say, \"I offer Jesus Christ my life,\" and you've never received the Holy Ghost; come into It. You must do it. You must grow into It. Ask God to pile Word on top of Word, like that, until you become the full stature of a son of God, or a daughter of God. Taking the things of the world? First John says, \"If you love the world, or the things of the world, it's because the love of God is not even in you.\" You've been deceived. You got the love of the world there, and it's deceived you, the Devil has, by piling things on to there, and showing. See? You can't... Well, then, you cannot take one Word of God out of the Bible. What caused the first sin? Not by just a big point blank lie, but because Eve misconstrued, the Devil did to her, one Word. One Word, broke the chain, and refused to take one Word. That was the beginning of the Bible. Jesus came in the center of the Bible. He said, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" That's the entire Word of God. Do you believe That's the revelation of Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] The entire Word of God. Then, in Revelations 22, Jesus came to John, on the isle of Patmos. And Jesus, \"I Jesus have sent My angel to testify of these things.\" See? \"Whosoever shall take one Word out of This, or add one word to It, I'll take his part from the Book of Life.\" [Ephesians 4:13], [I John 2:15], [Revelation 22:19], [Genesis 3:1-4], [Matthew 4:4], [Revelation 22:18-19]\n\nL-84 Not just say, \"Well, I--I believe Jesus Christ, Son of God.\" That's all right. Then add the rest of It to it. You say, \"I been justified. I give my hand to the minister. I believe in Jesus Christ.\" Then you've got to be born-again. You must be filled with the Holy Ghost. See? Just keep adding on, as you keep on going. You're growing into the stature of a son and daughter of God. My! 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min God, able to prepare us, and to give to us that crave in our life, that we want to see something. How many in here wants more of God? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Why, it goes to show there is more for you. See? You're craving it. Your little birth pains are coming on. See? You need more, so that we can be happy, and free, and perfect. We got to be. [I Timothy 1:12], [Acts 20:32], [John 3:3], [Luke 1:15], [Acts 2:4], [Acts 4:31]\n\nL-85 Like the--the little--the little germ of life being the... in the bosom of God, just like, and the germ of life is in the bo-... in the bosom of the mother. God is growing; and going, gone, to prepare the place for us, the Eternal place with Himself; not a place where there's a pesthouse, a dying, sin, adultery, and filth of the world here. If your mind is on that, it shows it never has come in contact with God. See? You're worked up. You got a mental illusion. You just join church and say, \"Well, I belong to this. My mother belonged to that.\" That might have been all right in your mother's day, but we're living in another day.\n\nL-86 Wesley's message would have never... He just couldn't take Luther. Luther believed in justification, but Wesley had sanctification. The Pentecostals come along, they couldn't take just justification, sanctification. They, it was time for the restoration of the gifts. Now we're going from that. See? The three stages of the--the Vine coming up. The first, it's a little blade, Luther come up, from the reformation. All right. That was the stalk. Watch nature. God and nature works in continuity, because God is in nature. See? The next come, the tassel, the pollen, the Methodist age. Then come the Pentecostal, oh, my, just so perfect, see, just like a grain of wheat looks like it's perfect wheat, grain of wheat. Open it up, there's no wheat there, at all. It's a shuck, a carrier of It, but that Life is working on through. See? [Revelation 3:7-13]\n\nL-87 Them back there in the Luther age accept Luther. That Life come through, but it went and denominated out. The first thing you know, just become a denominational whose end is to be burned. See? The stalk dries up; is just a carrier. Some of them still try to stay in that old carrier stalk, know nothing about God, dead. They say, \"Well, look, we're a leaf. We was a Luther.\" That's right. But look where it's at now. See? \"We were a Methodist.\" And even, \"We were a Pentecostal.\" But look at Pentecost, how cold and formal it's getting, how everybody walking away. See? What is it? It was a carrier of the real Seed. See? All these others was carrier, but went denomination. If you say, \"I'm Pentecost,\" that's don't mean no more to God than if you said you was a Roman Catholic or a Jew, or whatever you might be. [Revelation 3:1-6, 14-21]\n\nL-88 You got to be born, that Life that come through that carrier there. Don't stay in the stalk. Don't stay in the seed. Go right on out to the perfect part.\n\nL-89 Now, remember, and every reformation we've had, on all those Lutherans and so forth, in three years they organize. That's right. Every revival brought a organization in three years. Think how long this been going on, twenty-something years, and no organization. Why? It's the Seed, coming, forming under the husk, like this. Laying out, now it's got to lay in the Presence of the Son, to ripen into the glorious grain like the One that went into the first. The real Church that went down, first, is coming right back up through the stalk, to come out, another Church, when the combine comes to pick It up. The Life that went down in Luther, the Life that went down in the Methodist, the Life that went down in the Pentecostal, will come into the grain. It'll all go right into the grain, and go out, forming the perfect Body of Jesus Christ.\n\nL-90 Just like the sun comes up, of morn. You can't look at no nature 'less it testifies of God. You don't need even the Bible, to know there's a God. The little sun born, a little weak baby. About seven o'clock, goes, starts off to school. Ten or eleven o'clock, it's out. Twelve o'clock, it's in its strength. Three o'clock in the afternoon, it's getting old. Seven or eight, six... Five or six o'clock in the afternoon, she's getting stooped-shouldered. It dies. Is that the end of it? No. It resurrects again the next morning. The life, death, burial, resurrection!\n\nL-91 Look at the leaves come on the trees. It comes up, a good, fine leaf; brings out shade; puts out its fruit. Next, first thing you know, autumn comes, strikes it, death; runs right down into the root, into the ground again. Is that the end of it? Next spring she comes right back again to testify. Oh! That's perpetual life. But, brother, sister, we got Eternal Life. We've got Eternal Life through this great One Who came, has gone, is able to 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min prepare us a body. And these growing pains we feel, like you women feel condemned of what you do, you men that hangs on to seminary doctrines, and so forth, you all want to say, \"I--I recite this creed. I do this.\" But there's something right down in you, when you see the eyes of the blind opened; the deaf unders-... blind. All these things that's promised. See the Word preached in Its power. See a prostitute, off the street, made a lady. See a--see a drunkard come out of there, and be a real saint of God. My! See? There's something, Life in there. And you begin to feel, \"Well, maybe I oughtn't to do that.\" But, see, what it is, it's something. Your Body hungers a need, and, \"Come on.\" But God's got the vitamins right in Here for every bit of that Body. Jesus has gone to prepare the place in the bosom of God; yes, sir, a little germ, son of God, little son or daughter of God. [John 14:2-3]\n\nL-92 Jesus only asked for one thing, in His prayer to the Father. You know what that was? One thing, after all of His sacrifice that He did here on earth, the life that He lived, the path that He walked. He asked for one thing, \"That where I am, they may be also.\" He asked for our fellowship. That's the only thing He asked the Father in the prayer, your companionship forever. If you want to read this in Saint John 17, and 24th verse. Then how much should we desire Him? If He desire... Now listen. If you really are born of the Spirit of God, that means everything to you. See? It ain't some book of rules. You don't live any laws and so forth. You live by the grace of God, the Spirit of God. [John 17:24]\n\nL-93 I've often said this. As a missionary, I'd be going overseas. What if I brought my wife in, my children, \"Now looky here, children! Listen here, Mrs. Branham! I am your husband. Thou shall not have any other husbands while I'm gone. If you do, I'll skin you when I get back home\"? Uh-huh. See? Stomp my foot, \"Children, hear what I say?\" \"Yeah. Yes, papa. Yeah.\" \"You let me hear of one transgression? See?\" See? Now, wouldn't that be a home? Now what if she say, \"Now, you through, sir? Now I want to tell you something. Mr. Branham, I am your lawful wedded wife! Thou shall not have any other girl friends while you're gone, either\"? Now, wouldn't that be a home? Now, that would be something. We don't do that. I love her, and she loves me. When she knows I'm going, she knows I don't go 'less the Lord calls me to go. We get down on the floor, and get the children around. We pray. I said, \"Dear God, take care of my little companion, my children.\" They say, \"God, take care of daddy while we're gone, while he's gone.\" And then when we go over...\n\nL-94 Now, what if I did do something wrong over there? What if I did transgress, do something wrong? And I come back and went to that poor little wife of mine, stood there and look at her face wrinkling, and her hair turning gray, I walked up and said, \"Honey, I want to tell you something. You know I love you.\" \"Sure, Bill, I know you love me.\" [Ephesians 5:25]\n\nL-95 \"I tell you what I done. I took some girl home.\" I--I say, \"Will you forgive me for it?\" I believe she would. I really do. But would I do that? When I look, standing there, see them hairs turning gray, and know she has stood between me and the public, and I know what a real wife she has been, could I do that? I--I'd rather die than hurt her. I would. And that, in phileo love to my wife, how much greater is my agapao love to God! Oh, I wouldn't do nothing to hurt Him. Certainly not. I--I love Him. I want to do everything that He--He wants me to do. I want to cope with every Word that He said, no matter what the world says. They, they ain't going to believe It, anyhow. I want to know what He said for me to do. And if I lack something, I want Him to give it to me. And live for Him, keeping ourselves from the world.\n\nL-96 This old earthly body here has got to its... Let me tell you. This earthly body that you think so much of, that you pattern after Hollywood. You're so close to it. It won't be there much longer. You remember. You've heard the prophecy, see, that the Lord give me, \"It's going under.\" Yes, sir. Notice. It will. You just watch. Now, It never told me nothing wrong, yet. I'll take that to anybody that wants to say. I don't know when or where, but she's done. Judgment hangs over it. There's no redemption for it; it's passed. See?\n\nL-97 Now notice this. Live for Him, keeping ourselves from the world. Now look. You look on television, some of you sisters, and you go down here and you want, you young women. You're young. I know that. But you're Christians. See? 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min You're different. You don't want to be like the world. You love the world. It's not only you young ones; some of you older ones. See? Well, what does that? See? You watch television, you go down to the store, you see these little old clothes that women wear, that's ungodly. Do you know what's going to happen at the Day of Judgment? You might be just as virtuous to your husband as you can be, but in the Day of Judgment you're going to have to answer for committing adultery. Jesus said, \"Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.\" Who is to blame? You. See? You presented yourself, them shorts and slacks. Some women said to me, not long ago, said, \"I don't wear shorts, Brother Branham. I thank the Lord for that. I wear slacks.\" [Matthew 5:28], [Deuteronomy 22:5]\n\nL-98 I said, \"That's worse.\" That's worse. That's right.\n\nL-99 You can't even buy a dress, hardly, for a woman. She said, one woman said, \"Well, you said the truth. 'You can't. You can't buy it.'\" But they still sell goods and have sewing machines. See? So there's no excuse, at all. See? See? It goes to show, sister. I'm your brother. And I'm a servant to Christ, that's got to answer at the Judgment Bar for what I say here tonight. See? You're going to stand, guilty of adultery, because that the love of God has leaked out of your heart. You still go to church. You might still dance in the Spirit. You might still speak with tongues. And them things are fine, but that's not It yet. No, sir.\n\nL-100 Remember, the Bible said, \"In the last days there shall come false Christs,\" not false Jesuses. They wouldn't stand still for that. But, \"false Christs,\" false anointed-ones. They're absolutely anointed with the Spirit, with the Holy Spirit, and still false. See? There's two... [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-101 There's three people of you. The outside is the body. You got five senses, that you contact your earthly home with that. The inside is a spirit. There's five senses there, love and conscience, and so forth, you contact. But the inside of that is the soul.\n\nL-102 Remember, \"The rain falls on the just and the unjust.\" The same rain that'll make a grain of wheat grow makes a cocklebur grow too. See? What is it? At the inside of that seed is a nature, and that nature display, displays itself. It can stand in the same field, right there with the weed. The weed and the wheat stand together, rejoice just as much. Its head is down. It's starving for a drink. When a rain comes, the cocklebur can shout just as loud as the wheat can. \"But by their fruits you shall know them.\" See? [Matthew 5:45], [Hebrews 6:7-8], [Matthew 7:16, 20]\n\nL-103 Christians, I may never see you again. See, it's been years since I been here. May never see you again. Line up with God's Word. Look in the mirror. Like a little boy one time, had been out in the country, never seen a mirror. He come to his--his auntie's house. He started walking up the steps. He seen a mirror, and he seen a little boy in the mirror. He kept walking up, looking. And--and he would wave, and the little boy would wave. And he kept looking. He never seen himself in a mirror. So when he got close enough to it, he turn around, said, \"Why, Mama, that's me!\"\n\nL-104 How do you look, in God's mirror? Does it reflect a daughter or a son of God? Is there something, which, you hear That, does it make you hate the man that's saying It? Or, is there something pull, say, \"I know that man is right because that's in the Scripture\"? Then, that's the vitamins needed for this body that's ordained to be there, a house that that other one is going to need when you get there. See? \"This house; if we have borne an earthy.\"\n\nL-105 Now remember, we think so much of this body. We put so many clothes on it. We do so many things, that, unnecessary, change after change after change, and all these things. And--and, oh, it's just everybody. Just let somebody start something. You paint your steps red and watch the Joneses paint theirs red. You change from a Chevrolet to a Ford, and they just can't stand it. It's matching time. You let the... You let a woman come to church, certain kind of a hat on, watch all the women get that; especially the pastor's wife, see, just watch what happens. Now, that is true. That is the absolutely truth. It's matching time. Brother, it ought to be matching time. And all them--all them things is--is for a purpose. I don't care whether my coat matches my trousers. And I have a hard time. My wife or my daughter-in-law, somebody, 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min tell me what kind of--of tie to wear with it. I--I don't care whether they match, though. I want my experience to match God's Word. That's the thing, 'cause that's where I aim to live; not down on the corner yonder with the Joneses, but yonder in Glory where Jesus is, gone to prepare us a place. Yes, we want that. Yes, sir. Keep from all this.\n\nL-106 This old earthly tabernacle here, you know what it is? This body is like an old coat that you wear, a coat that you once wear. But now you have one so much better, you don't use it any more. What do you do? You hang it in the closet, for you've got one better. You've got a better coat. It's more up to date than the one you used to wear, that's worn out. What? It is that garment. You are the inside of that there. That garment only done what? It bore your image. See? But you don't need it any more now. You've hung it up. It's a rag. And that's the way this old body is, you, it's bore the image of the heavenly. Yet, it is not you. You are on the inside of that body. You, the Spirit of God, is on the inside of that body. That's what makes the outside come into subjections, because the inside is pulling it, see, bringing it in line with the Word of God; your inside, you yourself, your being. This body is just an old coat. And some day, what will you do with it, for you was--was only in the garment for a while? That is like the earthly garment; this body. Your--your real body, your real self, is on the inside of this old coat that you call William Branham, or Susie Jones, or whoever it is. See? Some day it will hang in the earth's hall of memory of you. You'll put it out yonder in the grave, and somebody will put a tombstone up, \"Here lies Rev. So-and-so, or John So-and-so, or So-and-so.\" It'll lie there as a memorial of you. The people just seen you in this. And what you was, your real you, was on the inside of that. But the old coat, itself, just \"borne the image of the Heavenly.\" Oh, people, have you made reservations to change coats? Have you made reservations for Heaven? Remember, you must have reservations. You can't get in without them. I'm talking to you in modern language now, that you know. If you go to the hotel, say, \"Well, I had the...\" [I Corinthians 15:49-50]\n\nL-107 \"Did you have reservations? Well, I'm sorry. Everything is filled up.\" You're out in the cold, because you failed to make reservations. And if you come to the end of your life's journey, without reservations, there will be no One there to meet you. You'll have to step off into a dark Eternity where there will be screaming, and weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth. You must. You can't get into the City, you, because you haven't got reservation. You must have them, to enter the City, where Jesus has gone to prepare a place for you. Remember, you must have the reservations, and the garment of salvation, on. You cannot. [Matthew 24:51], [Matthew 25:10, 30], [Matthew 8:12], [Luke 13:28]\n\nL-108 In Matthew, I got a Scripture here. I'm watching Scripture, Matthew, twenty-... 22:1 to 14. I haven't time to read it, because it's getting too late. I've spoke too long, to you. But remember, the king sent forth and made a supper. He killed all of his oxes, and--and fixed the fatlings and everything, had a great supper prepared. And he sent out, and he bid many to come. One said, \"Well, you know, after all, I belong to this.\" \"And I got this.\" \"I got to go with my farm.\" And one did many things. And he sent again, and they evilly mistreated them. And finally... That was the Jewish generation, Jesus was talking to. They had something else to do. Then, finally, he sent in, \"And say... Go. Just don't... Just compel them. Go into the streets and highways, and everywhere, and compel them to come in.\" And after that, determined that his house was... His wedding supper was going to be set. There's going to be guests there. And then he found a man in there without the wedding garment on. He wanted to hold to the old coat. And look what he said. \"Friend, after I have invited you to my wedding supper, and I invited you and give you an invitation to come!\" [Matthew 22:1-14]\n\nL-109 And if you ever was in the Orients, which I preached in there many time, that wedding supper is still carried on just the way it was. The bridegroom, that, all, he has so many guests that he's going to have. Probably, Brother Kopp, probably you've watched it there in India. See? They have so many guests that he's going to ask; say he's going to ask thirty guests. Now, the bridegroom has to furnish the robes. He has to furnish them, therefore there's a man stands at the door. And you come up with your invitation. He examines your invitation and puts you on a garment, a robe. That, some of them 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min are rich, and some of them are poor, and some of them are different, but they all look alike when they get these robes on. They all look alike. And you have to all be alike. You ain't going to be, say, \"I'm the Methodist over here. I'm the Presbyterian over here.\" Oh, no. You ain't going in, the first place. See? You've got to come by the Door. Jesus said, \"I am the Door to the sheepfold.\" \"I'm Pentecostal. I'm this. I'm that.\" That don't mean one thing. You come by that Door. And if you come by that Door, you get the robe.\n\nL-110 And this man, when he said, \"How did you get in here, friend?\" See? It showed he come up some other way, and come in a window, come in the back way, but not through the door; not through the Door, the way that Jesus came, through self-sacrifice; giving your all to God, and walking to Calvary and be crucified with Him. And rise again, to wear His garment of sacrifice and death to the things of the world. [Matthew 22:12]\n\nL-111 \"If you love the world, or the things of the world, the love of God is not even in you.\" See? If you still have the love of the world, want to act like the world, and do like the world; you're try... you're... Yet, you're in the church, but a cocklebur in the patch with the wheat; shout with the rest of them, rejoice with the rest of them. All the spiritual blessings is right upon you. You say, \"Well, I prophesy.\" So did Caiaphas. So did Balaam. That has nothing... [I John 2:15]\n\nL-112 \"I got the baptism, the Holy Spirit.\" That still has nothing to do with it. That's just only a temporal gift for you. The real gift is your soul down in there, see, that was born of God, and that controls the whole thing to the Word of God and the will of God. And there you grow up, see, then you're a son and daughter of God. You're a child of God. And these things, as you come up... Like the mother, now you're in the bowels of the earth, trying to come forth. You're a son of God, coming forth, and you see the Word says, \"I should do this. I should be born-again.\" \"Well, I belong to church.\" That don't mean one thing. See? \"I'm Methodist; my mother.\" That's good for your mother. [I John 3:2]\n\nL-113 \"Well, my, I'm Pentecostal. I belong.\" That, if you don't line with that Word, there is something wrong. See? Then, you see, your real father ain't God. See? Because, that real start in your soul, before there even was a spirit, it was your soul. That soul didn't come from God, then it wasn't a germ of God, to begin. You're deceived. You're in a patch of weeds and bearing the world's record of the weeds coming forth. Acting like the world, loving the world, is because the love of God is not in you.\n\nL-114 And now there'll be false anointed-ones in the last days, not false Jesus. They wouldn't stand for that. But, \"false,\" anointed. They are anointed, yes, sir, but they're anti-Christ. They're anointed with the Spirit, to do the signs and wonders that Christ did, but won't line up with His Word. See? \"Many will come to Me, that Day, and say, 'Lord, have not I prophesied, and cast out devils, in Your Name?'\" He say, \"Depart from Me, you that work iniquity. I never even knew you.\" \"I was Pentecostal, Lord. Glory to God! I shouted. I spoke with tongues. And I laid hands on the sick, and healed them, cast out devils.\" \"Depart from Me, you that work iniquity. I never knew you.\" [Matthew 7:22-23], [Luke 13:27]\n\nL-115 See what I mean? Oh, little children, do you feel the need of that vitamin tonight, that something? There's a body waiting yonder. There's a body waiting to be received. People, don't be deceived. Don't be deceived. The Devil is a deceiver. Even the--the wedding garment, you must wear It. It must be. [Matthew 24:11-13], [Matthew 22:11-12], [II John 1:7]\n\nL-116 Now we're at the evening time. The earthly body is now ready to be dissolved, and we're preparing to enter into the Heavenly. And we now feel the strange call, of God, to go to this great Eden. And before we can be born here, our little bodies cried for something that--that had to be provided, or we'd be an afflicted child here if we wasn't. God has no afflictions up there. They're, every one, perfectly lined up, the Bride just exactly like the Groom was, the Word manifested in Its season. God grant, tonight, children, each and every one of you! There is a Heaven to go to. There's a 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min hell to stay away from. [II Corinthians 5:1-4]\n\nL-117 Now, many of you know that the Lord has given me visions, thousands of those. The greatest thing... I used to fear death. About three years ago, you seen the Christian Business Men, a Past The Curtain Of Time. I realize I might not live through this night. I may never see you again in my life here, but this is true. I--I don't know whether I'd call this a vision, or what it was. One morning, recently, I was... I had just woke up. I come in from meetings. And my wife was laying there, asleep. I said, \"Honey, are you awake?\" She was still sleeping. I know we had to get up, to get the children off to school. And I put my hands back up, like this, and I said, \"Well, say, Bill Branham, do you know you're past fifty? You, if you're going to do something for the Lord, you better hurry up, 'cause you ain't got too much more time.\" I thought, \"My, I hope that I can live to see the Coming of the Lord Jesus.\" I always had it in my mind, that--that when we died, I'd see, like, brother here. I'd say... \"Yeah, you preached in my church, one night down on earth, Brother Branham.\" But, he--he's a spirit, I couldn't shake his hand, because his hand is out there in the grave, rotted away, see; mine, too. I used to kind of think that.\n\nL-118 But that morning, when, I felt Something come over me. I thought... Usually, like a vision comes. And I looked, and I--I looked. I thought, \"My! What is this?\" And I looked, a great, green hills. And young women was coming from everything, by the tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. And they were all coming, long hair hanging down their back, white robes on, barefooted, screaming, hollering, \"Our brother!\"\n\nL-119 I--I thought, \"Now, this is strange.\" I turned back around and looked. And there I laid right there, and there was my wife, laying there on the bed. And I said, \"Now, you know what? I died.\" I said, \"That, that's what's happened. I--I've died.\" And I said, \"I might have had a heart attack, or something. I've died. There lays my body.\" I was just laying there with my hands back, like that, just as stiff. I thought, \"That's not twenty feet from me.\" And there I was, looking. I thought, \"That's... There is my wife there. There, there is everything. There is my shirt hanging there on that bedpost there.\" And I thought, \"Here I am.\"\n\nL-120 I looked around again, and these women were all coming. And they were... I looked, coming this way, and there come my brothers. Oh! They're genuine. All of them looked to be young men. They were screaming, \"Our precious brother!\" Oh, I didn't know what to think.\n\nL-121 I thought, \"This is strange.\" I looked back, and I wasn't an old man. I was young. I thought, \"This is a strange thing.\" I thought, \"Is this a vision?\" I'd bite my finger. And I thought, \"No. It ain't the kind of vision I've had.\"\n\nL-122 Then, there, Something begin to talk to me up here, and said, \"You've entered in with your people.\" I thought, \"With my people? Are all these Branhams?\"\n\nL-123 He said, \"They're your converts to Christ.\" And these women... You know I've always been considered, on account of they'd call me \"woman-hater,\" but I'm not. See? Cause, I believe... I--I--I don't like immoral, indecent. I like real, genuine sisters of Christ. If that way, all right.\n\nL-124 I had some scars when I was a kid. I know things that happened that's kind of turned me that way. But it--it was all God, making, molding me for this hour. See?\n\nL-125 I think a real, genuine sister, there's nothing any nicer. If God could give a man anything better than salvation, He'd give him a wife. See? And so, then, if He could give anything better, He would have done it. And then to see some of them turn and don't even act like a wife, unloyal to their marriage vows, and their husbands the same. Remember, you're bound as long as you live, to one another. \"What God joins on earth, joined in Heaven also.\" See? [Matthew 19:5-6], [Romans 7:2], [I Corinthians 7:27, 39]\n\nL-126 And so then I--I seen that. And these women run up and was throwing their arms around me, and hugging me, and call me, \"Brother!\" Now, they were women, but there can never be sin in that place. See? They were women. But, see, what made us now, a women with a--a gland, a female gland, and a man with a male gland, it's for raising children. There it won't be. They'll all be one gland, but they'll still be in the form. The earthly image that they bore here will be there, but there'll never can be sin. You're all the same. There'll be no more children raised there. See? That's right. It'll 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min all be that way. And so I looked, and these women.\n\nL-127 And they picked me up. These brothers set me up on a place. I said, \"Why'd you do this?\" He said, \"In earth you was a leader.\" And said--and said, \"You... These are the people.\"\n\nL-128 And there was some woman come up. She said, \"Our precious brother.\" Most beautiful woman! When she passed by, this Voice stopped, said, \"Don't you remember her?\" I said, \"No.\" Said, \"You led her to Christ when she was past ninety. See? Can't you see why she says 'precious brother'?\" I said, \"Well, do--do you go...\" Said, \"No. We're waiting here.\" I said, \"Well, if I've passed over, I want to see Jesus.\" Said, \"You can't see Him now. This is the Scripture, said, 'Souls under the altar.' He's just a little higher. Some day He will return. We're go back to earth. We don't eat or drink here.\"\n\nL-129 I said, \"You mean I was afraid of this? Why, this...\" There's no word to speak it, friends. \"It's perfect,\" wouldn't--wouldn't touch it, \"sublime.\" There's no English vocabulary that I know, no word at all, that could ever express what it is. It's beyond anything that I know. There he was. There was no sickness, no sorrow. You couldn't die. You couldn't sin. It was just perfect, just perfect. Friends, you mustn't, you mustn't miss it. Remember.\n\nL-130 And when I was a little boy, I saw a vision of hell, as a little boy. And you know how the ladies, today, or the women (lady wouldn't do a thing like that), paint their eyes like a wolf, or something like that, that blue stuff under their eye. I seen that. I was sinking. As a little boy, I had been shot, and I was laying, dying in a hospital. And I had always knowed there was God. I remember the first prayer I ever tried to pray. The only thing I could say... I--I've never told this before. I just feel I'll tell it right now. I was shot, laying there, dying in a field. And the only plea that I could have to God, I said, \"You know, Lord, I never did commit adultery.\" See? As a little, young boy about fifteen years old, I tried to live right. And I said, \"I've lived clean.\" And that's all I could say. That's all the merit that I could offer Him.\n\nL-131 And then laying there, then, when the doctor done walked away from me, and I felt myself sinking into a dark Eternity, and looked like. I holler for papa, \"Oh, papa, help me.\" There was no papa there. \"Mama, help me.\" There was no mama there. \"God, help me.\" There was no God there. It was just the endless, horrible, oh, nightmare. Burning, blazing hell would be a pleasure, being up aside of that. And falling through there, I thought, \"Oh, my!\" Over and over, like this. I got into a place, smoke, and dark, and sick. And, oh, such a feeling! It was death on me. I could see those women coming up to me, with them kind of painted eyes like that. Now remember, that's been forty-five years ago, about forty years ago, anyhow. Going, they was going, \"Oooh! Oooh! Oooh!\" I said, \"Am I to be there forever?\" \"Forever.\"\n\nL-132 I said, \"O God, if You'll let me out of here, I--I--I'll never be ashamed of You again. I'll never be ashamed. God, please give me a chance.\" The first thing you know, I felt myself coming back up. And the doctor was alarmed, 'cause my heart was only beating seventeen times to the minute. I done bled all my blood out and everything, was laying in my own blood. And I've wondered, some day that would happen?\n\nL-133 About two years ago, when I moved to Tucson, I was with my wife down at J. C. Penney's. I was setting there like that, and with my head down, waiting. Cause, you know how, ladies, they shop a long time. And I was--I was setting there, my head down like this. And an escalator was coming up. And here come some of them women up, with them waterhead haircuts, you know, like they do, like that. Coming up with them painted-looking eyes like that. And they were speaking Spanish. And that's that. It all (the vision) reoccurred again. There it was, \"Oooh! Oooh!\"\n\nL-134 Brother, sister, let me tell you something. It may seem funny now, but you once get there. It's a serious thing. 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min Don't you never go that way.\n\nL-135 Me, as an old man, a minister, I preached around the world, got millions of friends, but I know I've got to stand with you yonder. Get away from the things of the world. And if there is something in you, that you still want to act the way you act, if you do have the things of the world in you, remember, you're none of God's. You're just a church member, until that call; that deep, calling to the Deep. See? [Psalms 42:7]\n\nL-136 Like, before there was a fin on a fish's back, there had to be a water for him to swim in, first, or he'd never had a fin. Before there was a--a tree to grow in the earth, there had to be an earth, or there would have been no tree to grow in it. There'd be no reason for the tree, and to make it coexist.\n\nL-137 Before there is a creation, there has to be a Creator. \"Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness.\" See? There is something in us. You raised your hand a while ago, \"I want more of God.\" See? There is something needy. And if you love the world, going that way, the things of the world, the world's travel you'll go, and in the fall you'll be. See? Come out. You're sons and daughters of a King, the King. Be lady and gentleman. Walk like Christians. Live like Christians. Act like Christians. Remember, I'll meet you at the Judgment Bar with these remarks. See? [Matthew 5:6]\n\nL-138 Look in your looking glass, tonight, and see. \"Which way am I headed? Is Jesus preparing a place for me, a body? That body is perfect. That body walks orderly. It's a son or a daughter before God. And I'm birth pains in here, to be born into that body there. If I still love the world, it shows me that (I'm not) I have no body there. I'm just a church member. I wasn't the germ of God. I am not. He is not my Father.\" [John 14:2-3]\n\nL-139 He said, \"If you cannot stand chastisement,\" that's what you're getting now, \"then you're bastard children, and not the children of God.\" Isn't that right? [Congregation says, \"Right.\"--Ed.] Does the Bible say that? [\"Amen.\"] If you cannot stand the chastisement of God, when you see the Scripture lining you up, and you say, \"Oh, I don't want to hear that Stuff. I'm--I'm a Christian. I do a...\" All right. Go ahead. See? It's one sure evidence that you're not a child of God. But a real child of God is hungering and thirsting. Why? If there's something in your heart, telling you you want it, and it needs there, it shows there's something pulsating, trying to pull you there. There's a body there, that this one is a type of here. What are you using this one for, to glorify the Devil and the world, and fashions and things? Are you looking towards Heaven, there's something up there, you're glorifying God with your life? In my Father's house are many mansions: if it wasn't so, I would have told you. And I'll go and prepare a place for you. ... and come again, to receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. [Revelation 3:19], [Matthew 5:6, 16], [Luke 6:21], [I Corinthians 6:20], [John 14:2-3]\n\nL-140 Things That Are To Be. These things that are now, are only potential, calling for the things that is to be. Let us pray.\n\nL-141 Think seriously. Will you, dear Christian friends? Think real seriously, just a moment. Let's just be real quiet just for a moment. Let the Holy Spirit speak. Now, the Lord Jesus sent me to you Pentecostal people, long ago. Here is one of your boys that's come up to be your pastor, said, \"Resulted from the ministry.\" He seen the Lord Jesus open the blinded eyes; \"make,\" he said, \"the waterheads shrink right up.\" I still have healing services. But I realize that I have prayed for many people that were very sick. They were healed. The Lord answered prayer, and healed the sick. But, you know, some of those people, were healed, has already died. And no matter how sick you are, if you're healed, you're going to die, anyhow.\n\nL-142 But that soul, my precious brother, that soul, my precious sister, won't you think about it now? That's Eternal. If that love of God is not in there, there is nothing pulling, won't you ask God, \"O God, start me over, new, tonight. I love You, Lord. I want to love You. And something in my heart tells me that I must live closer to You. I want to come, right now, Lord, and do that\"? If that person or persons are in this building or out of this building, I ask you, as a servant of Christ, in the Name of Jesus Christ, will you just, with your head bowed, raise up your hand to God and say this much, 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min \"God, draw me nearer, nearer, dear God. I want to line with everything that You have in Your Word\"? Raise your hands. Now just be real honest. Just think.\n\nL-143 Now, they say, \"Oh, I've done this. I, I've shouted, the Spirit. I've spoke in tongues. But, look, there is something lacking in my life. I look in the mirror of God's Word, I know there's something. I go to church, but I'm not what I should be.\" See? That shows that, something. Now, if you can look at yourself and see that you're not lined up with God's Word, and there's nothing in there that'll cause you to raise your hand, then you know there's something wrong. You have. There's... Mother used to say, \"You can't get blood from a turnip, because there's no blood in it.\" See? Think of it, real seriously. This might be your last opportunity. Thirty, forty hands has been up, this little group here, even to clergymen.\n\nL-144 Just be real reverent just a moment. Now think real straight. \"Dear God, I may be killed, tonight, in an accident. I may die in a heart attack. One of these mornings, I may call the doctor, and he come, and my pulse is beating up my sleeve; I'm gone. I'm pressing my cheek against the pillows, call, 'O God! O God! O God!'\" See? That heart is making its last beat. You're coming to that great Door. You'll never come out unless you're born again of the Spirit of God. You'll never come out unless there's something in you, after you're born of the Spirit of God, hungering and thirsting to go on with God. It must be. See? You're a child in the earth, in the bowels of the earth, still waiting to be born into the Kingdom of God, where He's gone to prepare another body for you, that's a perfect body. Now think real deep, and let's pray together. [John 14:2-3], [John 3:3-8]\n\nL-145 Dear God, as I know that this is paged on the Book, the great Record! We have blundered into science, Lord, enough to wake us up, for realities to know that every move that we make goes around and around the world, the same time we make it. We've got that through television. We do realize, Father, that that television doesn't manufacture a picture, it only channels the--the vibrations into a tube that makes the picture. Even the color of clothes that we've got on, shows through the ether waves of the air, that vibration around the world. Then how is our sisters with them clothes on, acting like that, and not even hunger; painted faces, cut hair? Ministers that would go to theology, some seminary, \"And take the things of man's word, which makes, by their traditions, makes the commandments of God of no effect upon the people, by their traditions,\" saying they should belong to church, and that's all. O God, do they realize that every word we say, scientifically proven, it's on a record? And it starts when we start living in this earth. It ends when we die, and it's put in God's album, to be played back again at the Judgment. How are we going to escape it, the damnation of God, if the thing has been made so clear before us and yet we turn It down? O dear God, these Words never die. They go on and on. The record will be played at the Day of the Judgment. You seen those hands that went up, Father. It'll be right there at the Day of Judgment. Also, what their heart was thinking, will be there at the Day of Judgment. [I Corinthians 11:5-6]\n\nL-146 Now, Father, God, I ask You, as Your servant, I pray that You'll take all the iniquity away from Your people. Iniquity: something that we know we should do, and don't do it. David said, \"If I conceive iniquity in my heart, God will not answer my prayers.\" I pray, God, that You'll take our iniquity, 'cause the Word is Your looking-glass that shows us of how short we are of being sons and daughters of the King. Father, I pray that You'll do it, tonight. [Psalms 66:18], [Matthew 24:12]\n\nL-147 And make that an altar, 'cause the altar is setting full of people. And make that altar, there in the chair where they're setting, make that heart of theirs the altar. May the world move off from every brother, sister in here. And may that little germ of Life, the gene of God that we just talked of, that attribute that come down from God, and has been manifested here to honor and glorify God. God, move the world from that.\n\nL-148 The others, I cannot pray, Lord, because \"the sickness is unto death,\" and there's nothing there that causes them to move. But those who can move, and know that it's wrong, clean their hearts and their souls, tonight, Father. And may they be filled with Your Spirit, walk in Your Light.\n\nL-149 Bless this dear, young, healthy, strong-looking pastor here, Lord. This young man, influenced, he said, by what 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min he saw You do. This fine young man, O God, set his soul afire. Grant it, Lord. May he be a true shepherd, continually, all the time, to feed the flock which the Holy Spirit has made him overseer over. Grant it, Lord. May he not turn right or left, no way for no creed, no nothing else but the unadulterated Word of God come from his mouth, and That only. Bless him, God, him and his loved ones, and his little church here. Be with them all, Father.\n\nL-150 I commit this to You, Father. The Seed has been sown. May It fall upon that seed that was ordained to Life, and grow great, strong Christians for this assembly here, and other assemblies where they come from. Grant it, Lord. I commit it to You, in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And, Father, \"He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquity; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we were healed.\" [Isaiah 53:5]\n\nL-151 I seen moving through the door, a few moments ago, a poor nervous woman. And, O God, into her own family, what great things has been done, how You have manifested Yourself! I pray, God, for that woman. Take away all that back past, of life, Lord, and heal her tonight. Will You, Lord? Take her to You.\n\nL-152 See it, little children setting here, Lord, needing healing, others. I pray that You'll heal them, Father. Grant it. May Your great healing power come and heal us, both soul and body.\n\nL-153 And now, to you now who are in the church here, or outside, that needs healing, I want you to raise up your hand, say, \"I need healing, Brother Branham.\" Looks like everybody does. All right. Will you believe me to be a servant of Christ? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Then, I want you to lay your hands over on one another. Just lay your hands over on each other. You raised your hands, that's inside or out, you raise your hands, that you were believers in God. Jesus Christ said, His last commission to the Church, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth... He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. He that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe; in My Name they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; if they take up serpents or drink deadly things, it won't harm them; but, and if they'll lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.\" Now, Jesus said that. Remember, He said that. That has to be. He wouldn't have said that 'less there's going to be somebody could catch that Word. [Mark 16:15-18]\n\nL-154 Just like the womb of Mary could catch the germ, \"A virgin shall conceive.\" Like a palm tree could be created, an oak tree on a hill, His Word did it. His Word can catch into your heart right now. \"I am a believer, Lord. This man or woman I got my hands on, they're suffering. I'm not praying for myself. Because, they're praying for me. I'm praying for her, or for him. And, O God, heal him, heal her. And I am a believer, and now we're assembled. We've just been taught that we were with Christ when He walked on earth, for we are part of His Word. We suffered with Him. We bled with Him. We died with Him. We was buried with Him. We are risen with Him, and we're setting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. The great King setting here in our midst, and I am a son or a daughter of this King. And I have my hand laid on a son or a daughter of the King, that's praying for me, and I'm praying for them. Now, Lord, answer my prayer, and heal this son of God or this daughter of God.\" Together, let's pray now for one another. [Isaiah 7:14], [Matthew 1:23], [Ephesians 2:6]\n\nL-155 Lord Jesus, we humbly come, confessing our wrongs. We come, confessing that we are worthy of sickness and death, and sorrow, but we are accepting Your propitiation for our sins and our sickness. And, tonight, these sons and daughters of God, setting here, hear the correction of the Word, and raising their hands, and wanting a closer walk. They laying hands on one another now because they believe Your Word to be true. They believe that we're now risen with Christ, setting in Heavenly places with Him. They got their hands on one another, praying one for another. You said, \"The prayer of faith shall save the sick, and God shall raise him up; and if he's did any sin, it shall be forgiven him. Confessing your faults one to another, pray one for the other, that you might be healed. For the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much.\" O Eternal God, hear the prayer of Your servants. And now, it's written again, \"If the people, that's called by My Name, shall assemble themselves together, and pray; then I'll hear from Heaven.\" O God, hear the prayer of Your children tonight, from Heaven. Send down the Holy Ghost 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min upon this audience, like a rushing mighty wind. And we bring these people before God. [I John 1:9], [I John 2:2], [James 5:15-16], [II Chronicles 7:14]\n\nL-156 Satan, you are defeated. You are a defeated being. Jesus Christ conquered you at Calvary. You have no power. You're a bluff. We're calling your hand, tonight. In the Name of Jesus Christ, come out of this people here, you sickness and diseases. And may they go, free, in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\n\nL-157 Hallelujah! Feel the glory of God! Feel your prayer answered. You believe God answered the person setting by you? How many believe it? Raise up your hands. [Congregation rejoices--Ed.] There you are. Oh, wonderful! I love Him, I... With your hands up now, sing it to Him, with all your heart. Because He first loved... Do you mean it, with all your heart now?\n\nL-158 How many of you feel that God has forgiven your iniquities, the things that you've done? \"And from this night on, O Lamb of God, I promise to walk upright. I'll walk in honor of the Name that I'm called, a Christian, Christ-like life. I'll raise my hands, God. I dedicate myself anew to You, tonight. I'll walking in the Light.\" Amen. We'll walk in the Light, beautiful Light, Come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us, by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. We'll walk in the Light, It's such a beautiful Light, It comes where the dewdrops... Where He's gone to prepare a place for us. Shine all around us, by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. Come, all ye saints of Light proclaim, Jesus, the Light of the world; Truth and mercy in His Name, Jesus, the Light of the world. What will we do then? We'll walk in the Light, such a beautiful Light, Comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us, by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. Oh, don't you feel all scoured out, feel good? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Oh, my! Let's shake hands, as we sing again. We'll walk in the Light, such a beautiful Light, Comes where... (God bless you, brother.)... of mercy are bright; Shine all around us, by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. Let's just close our eyes and hum it. [Brother Branham and congregation begin to hum Jesus, The Light Of The World--Ed.] We'll act like children. We are children. Oh, it's such a beautiful Light, And It comes where the dewdrop of mercy are bright; Oh, shine all around us, by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. Don't you love Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calva-... Just close your eyes and sing it. Worship in the Spirit. Saviour Divine; Now hear me while I pray, Take all my sins away, O let me from this day Be wholly Thine! While life's dark maze I tread, And grief around me spread, Oh, be Thou my Guide; Bid darkness turn to day, Wipe sorrow's fears away, Nor let me ever stray From Thee aside.\n\nL-159 Oh, my! I know I'm just an old-fashion guy. I like... I think that's got all the new, chopped-up, fandangoed, rock-and-roll impersonations beat, a million miles. Them old poets that wrote them songs, the Holy Spirit touched that pen, begin to write. Oh, my! Think of Eddie Pruitt and all them; great! Fanny Crosby: Pass me not, O gentle Saviour, Hear my humble cry.\n\nL-160 One time they was trying to get her. She didn't--she didn't do like the Pentecostal Elvis Presley, sell her birthrights for a mess of Cadillacs. She... Come to her and wanted her to write--write worldly songs. She said, \"I would not do it, for nothing.\" Said, \"Why, you're blind. When you get to Heaven, how you know?\" She turned around, inspiration, so she said: I shall know Him, I shall know Him, And redeemed by His side I shall stand; I shall know Him, I shall know (How?) By the prints of the nails in His... Otherwise, \"If I don't see Him, I'll feel His hand.\" I shall know Him, I shall know Him, And redeemed by His side I shall stand; I shall know Him, I shall know Him By the print of the nails in His hand.\n\nL-161 Don't it make you love Him? Gone to prepare a place for us! \"And if I go and prepare a place, I will return again, to receive you unto Myself.\" [John 14:2-3]\n\nL-162 Little children in travail now, re-obey the commandments of God. And pastor, here, if none of you has been baptized, the water will be ready. And--and membership for the church, or whatever you want to do, or whatever, you do it. You haven't got the baptism, the Holy Ghost, this is the night to receive It. Don't you believe that? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.]\n\nL-163 \"Oh,\" you say, \"Brother Branham, it's late. You done preached too long.\" Paul preached all night, one night, this same kind of Message. And a little... A young man fell off of the wall and killed himself. And Paul, so anointed with that same kind of Message, laid his body upon him, and the life come back into him again. He is still \"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever.\" [Acts 20:7-12] Don't you love Him? [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"--Ed.] Let's just, once more, with our hands up, \"I love Him. I love Him.\" 65-1205, Things That Are To Be, First Assembly Of God, Rialto, CA, 125 min Where's the pianist? There, if you will, sister, ever who it is. Give us the little chord, if you will. How many love Him? Just raise your hand. Say, \"I really love Him. I just love Him, with--with all my heart. I love Him.\" [Acts 20:9-12], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-164 Now let's just sing it, to the glory of God. Now, with our eyes closed, our hands up to Heaven, \"I love Him. I love Him.\" We'll worship Him. When you preach, and cut, and tear, and pull like that, this is the balm that God pours in, just heals. \"There's a Balm in Gilead, for the soul.\" Let's sing it now. Give us the chord. [Jeremiah 8:22] I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree.\n\nL-165 \"And in this will all men know that you're My disciples, when you have love, one for the other.\" That's right. If we can't love one another who we do see, how we going to love God Who we can't see? [John 13:34-35] I love Him.\n\nL-166 [Brother Branham speaks to a brother on the platform--Ed.] God bless you. [The brother says, \"Being here tonight is a real honor from Heaven.\"] Thank you, brother. [\"It's really nice.\"] Now, I think the church, every one, was strengthened. Don't you? [\"Yes. Really.\"] God bless you, Brother Boone. I'll turn the congregation to you. God bless you. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

Dear Heavenly Father, we thank Thee tonight because that You answer prayer for us. This poor dear woman laying there, where surgery has failed. But, O God, we remember the first surgery was ever performed in the earth, You did it Yourself. You taken from the side of Adam, a rib, closed up the incision, and made a wife. O Father, I pray tonight that Your hand will come down now and will perform this great thing that we're asking for. And these others, Lord, this woman that's suffering with mental oppression, all others who's got requests, we just commit them to Thee, Father, with our whole heart. In the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. [Genesis 2:21-24], [Psalms 37:5]\n\nL-2 Indeed a privilege to be here tonight and have this fine audience to look at. And fine singing, the wonderful little choir. I was just thinking the difference, seeing them boys standing there with... clean-looking fellows, clean haircuts. I was thinking, last night, of--of the place where I'm staying; a bunch of hoodlums came in down there and trying to drowned a boy in the swimming pool; they had to call out something and get them out of there. What a difference, see kids standing, singing the Gospel songs; what a difference.\n\nL-3 Thinking, as Brother Henry said there, \"those man with them hair like the women should have,\" you see. That--that--that's right. Look like the... I see these boys kind of have that hair, they even put these roller-curlers in it, around their face. I don't know, I... sometimes I become discouraged. It looks like it--it's a true time of perversion. Man are trying to wear women's clothes, and women wearing man's clothes. And man leaving their hair like women, and women having hair like man. What's the matter with this people, anyhow? Has the, really, the very threads of decency and honor left this nation and these people, this world? [Deuteronomy 22:5], [I Corinthians 11:14-15]\n\nL-4 This is a horrible time, but it's the most glorious time in the world, to preach the Gospel. If I could've stood on the brink of time before it come into existence, and the Father would have looked at me, and said, \"What time down through these ages would you want to preach?\" I'd want it right now, that's right, just before His coming.\n\nL-5 Looking out upon the audience, setting here before us... A minister friend of mine, in Tucson yesterday, was riding a horse. (Thinking of this man with this... this woman with the disc in her back.) This horse threw him. Another man called me at one o'clock this morning, to my hotel, and said, \"The man's at Veterans Hospital, and his eyes are glassy, his back smashed, his kidneys are pushed out, and his heart's about to fail.\" And there I got down on the floor, on my knees; telephone, got him on the other end, and prayed for him. And here he sets here tonight, setting right there. That was last night. Bob, would you just stand up there? There's the man, right there. [Congregation applauds--Ed.] God answers prayer, morning, night, noontime, midnight, or anytime.\n\nL-6 Now, I--I am such a long-winded preacher, as they call it. I just kind of hate to get started this time of night, and--and I thought I'd just come over. The other night, why, we was speaking over here at a certain place, and the... fifteen minutes after I had been on, the people was picking up the dishes and motioning to me, \"Quit! Shut up, you got to get out of here,\" smoking cigarettes, and carrying on. It wasn't the--the banquet's fault, it was the people that they had it rented from. And the--the chairman's wife went around and told the manager, said... Said, \"Well, you're supposed to be out of here at 9:30.\" Said, \"You never put that in the contract.\"\n\nL-7 This lady, tonight, she come down here (real nice lady) and she said, \"We understood that you want it,\" said, \"just take it as long as you want.\" So that... So I'm very thankful for that. That's very fine.\n\nL-8 Brother Henry, I certainly appreciate your--your kindness of inviting me here, and this chapter.\n\nL-9 I had the privilege last night of being down here at the Assemblies of God where I believe a Brother Boone is pastor. Had a wonderful time down there with that group of people. And tomorrow night we're going somewhere over here, I don't know where it's at, and it's another chapter. They take care of that; I just keep praying, reading, and going along, and it's about all I can keep up with. 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min\n\nL-10 But, now, we're seeing strange things in this day. Now I've remember the last time I was here was in a tent meeting. I remember of speaking of it last night, of a little couple that brought their dead baby in. It--it's up somewhere up here, they drove all day and night. The little mother setting, sad, holding that little baby in her arms. Now, she may be setting right here now, for all I know. And she... the little husband, couple of more couples with them, and they was... And she said... asked me if I'd come over (the man did) to the car. I took the little baby out and was just holding it; a little, dead, stiff, cold form; and I started to pray. And when I prayed, that body begin to feel like it was getting warm. So I just... I kept on praying. He started kicking and moving, going along, so I... started crying. I handed it back to the mother, she went on back home with it. So, they might not even been Christians, for all I know. See? That was wonderful.\n\nL-11 But what I'm thinking about, tonight, I know a church that's dying, too, it's our Pentecostal people. We got to shake out of this, uh-huh, that's all. And the only way you're going to do it is prayer and lining up with the Word of God. It's the only way we're going to do it. There's only one way out, He's that way, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Would we want our church get in the condition as he said over there, like in England? That's the reason I've been, you think, so rude, bawling you out. And I don't mean to do that, but I don't want to see the church get in that kind of a shape. You don't want to be in that shape. But yet you've just got to drive It down so hard till you nail It and make It clench. It's got to be done. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-12 So now, tonight, I've just got a... some Scriptures and text here I want to speak on for a while. I ain't going to say no certain time. You get tired, why... I may be through in thirty minutes, and just depends on... I always just kind of leave it to the Holy Spirit, just whichever way He leads.\n\nL-13 Let's bow our heads just a moment longer, speak to the Author before we open His Book.\n\nL-14 Almighty God, the Author of this Book, through Jesus Christ we pray. We are thankful for what we've already heard tonight. If we should--should punctuate this meeting by saying, \"Amen,\" and go home, it was good to be here, for we know that You've been with us. And, Father, as we open this Word now, speak to us directly out of this Word, that we might know the hour that we're living. If we know the hour we're living, then we can prepare for that hour; but if we go in blindly not knowing what or where, then we don't know how to prepare. So, Father, we pray that You'll let us see the Ark there, and the Door, open, and the Message calling us in. Grant it through Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.\n\nL-15 In the Holy Scriptures, I want to read a text here; found over in the Book of St. Luke, at the 24th chapter, the... I'm going to begin at the 13th verse, and read a portion of It. And, behold, two of them went the same day from the village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore--score furlong. And they talked together... these things which had happened. And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and... Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. And he said unto them, What manner of communication are these that you have one to another, as you walk, and are sad? And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered and said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and has thou not known all these things which have come to pass... in these days? And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: And how the chief priests and the rulers delivered him to the... be condemned to death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. Yea, and certain of the women also of our company made us astonished, which were... at the sepulchre; ... when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said unto them... that said that he was alive. 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but he they... but him they saw not. Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe (not to believe) all that the prophets have spoken: Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and... entered into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophetshe expounded unto them... all the scriptures the things concerning himself. May the Lord add His blessings to the reading of His Words. [Luke 24:13-27]\n\nL-16 Now I take... if I call it a subject, I'd like to take this: The events... Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy. Now, it's always been God's... the unchanging God's way to fore-... let His people foreknow before certain events happen. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-17 If the people in the days of the Lord Jesus would have only have sought God and knowed what was just about to take place, they would not have condemned Jesus to death. But the reason it was, because the Scriptures had to be fulfilled, because the Jews had to be blinded. We all are aware of that. [Romans 11:7], [Zechariah 12:10]\n\nL-18 Do you realize that that's promised again in this very age that we're living? The Laodicean Church Age, this seventh church age that we're in now, is naked, miserable, blind, and don't know it. The same as He blinded them back there for the purpose of getting His Message through to the elected people, He's promised to do the same thing today. [John 12:40], [Romans 11:7], [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-19 And if I'd say this to respects, and to all my brethren and sisters in Christ, one of these days somebody's going to say, \"Isn't it written that these things should happen first?\" And it'll be the same way it was then, \"Verily, I say unto you, he's already come, and they had did what they listed to him.\"\n\nL-20 When they asked Him, said, \"Why, the scribes say, and the Scriptures say that--that 'Elias must first come.'\" They said that to Jesus. [Matthew 17:10-12]\n\nL-21 He said, \"He's already come, and you didn't know him.\" See? And that's perhaps the way it'll end up again.\n\nL-22 Now we want to be posted, to know what's to take place for this age that we live in. God has lotted His Word to each age, so much to each age, and we must notice that one age cannot carry over into another age. It just won't work. For instance, as I've said, I believe last night or... I'm constantly speaking, night after night, places, and sometime I make a remark the second time. I don't mean to repeat myself. But I say this: What would... good would it have done Moses to try to preach Noah's message? Or what good would it been... would have done Jesus to try to preach Moses' message? Or what good would it done Martin Luther to continue on with the Catholic message? What good would it done Wesley to continue on with the Lutheran message? What good would it done Pentecostals to continue on with the Methodist message? Or what good will it do Pentecost to continue on when the Bride's being called? See, we're right up into the seed time, we're here at the end time. Now, unless a corn of wheat falls in the earth, it abides alone. [John 12:24]\n\nL-23 As the critic, as I've made remarks since the book come out, probably you got it here in your--your city, that German author that wrote one of the most critical articles. He's an infidel. Course not... I'm not condemning him because he's condemned me so; but, because, being an infidel, the book shouldn't never be on the shelves. And he said, \"A God that could set up and say He could open up the Red Sea and deliver His people, and then set with His hands across His stomach and see through the Dark Ages those Christians being tore to pieces by lions; those mothers with their hair saturated in tar, and hung onto crosses and burned; and their baby... expecting mothers, they'd split the stomach and gamble on the sex of the child; and set up and let it happen; people who was supposed to be servants of this God.\"\n\nL-24 You see, the Scripture is inspiration. You'll never be able to know the Scripture just by setting down and reading It from a theological standpoint, from an educational standpoint; it never has worked. [II Timothy 3:16] 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min\n\nL-25 I was speaking with a Baptist minister not long ago, he said, \"Until we learn the correct Greek, until we...\" I said, \"In the Nicaea Council, before that, they were arguing about the Greek words in the Bible.\" You'll never know It.\n\nL-26 The Bible is to be revealed by inspiration. That's the only thing, the revelation. Jesus told Peter, \"Upon this rock.\" This rock of revelation reveals who He is. \"Blessed art thou Simon, son of Jonas, flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father which is in Heaven has revealed this to you; upon this rock I'll build My Church.\" Not upon Peter, not upon Himself, but upon the spiritual revelation of who He was. [Matthew 16:17-18], [II Timothy 3:16]\n\nL-27 And He is the Word! St. John 1, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\" Hebrews 13:8, \"He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" [John 1:1, 14], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-28 Therefore we're living in the day when the manifestation of the Word of God has to come to a different age than the Pentecostal age. And that's right. Remember, you'll... I'm an uneducated person; but you can't beat nature, because God works in the continuity of nature. Just like, as I've said, the sun rises and sets; and goes through the day, and like a school age; and dies in the evening, to rise again the next morning. The trees let the sap down in the winter time, go into the roots, and come back in the spring. [Romans 8:19]\n\nL-29 Notice, He likened It to a grain of wheat, the Bride, the reason that God had to let that go like that. That fine, real, genuine Church that was established on the Day of Pentecost, had growed and growed since the Day of Pentecost, into a great church, it had to fall into the earth in that Dark Age and be buried like all seed does. It had to die so it could come forth in the reformation again. It come forth in the person of a reformation, Martin Luther. And from there, just like a stalk of wheat coming up. The first thing comes up, there's two little blades, then it keeps adding more blades. Up come Martin Luther, and then Zwingli, and on down, Calvin, and as they moved on. [John 12:24]\n\nL-30 Finally it goes into a tassel. Now, that was John Wesley in the Wesley age. It had a pollen drop back.\n\nL-31 From there come the Pentecostal age, so close, just like a real grain of wheat if you look at the stalk. But if you'll take that wheat and move it back, there's not one grain in it at all, it's only a shuck in the shape of a grain. But it's set there for a purpose, to shelter the grain until... If the sun hits it like that, it'd kill it. It's got to stay in there until a certain time, and all the Life leaves the shuck (as It left the stalk, left the pollen), leaves the shuck and goes into the wheat, and forms again just like it was down in the ground.\n\nL-32 Now, all of us know that whenever a message is given, in three years they form a organization. When they do that, it kills it right there; it did in the days of Luther, so it did it in the days of Wesley, it did it in the days of Alexander Campbell, and all the rest of them, and it did it in the days of Pentecost. Exactly! See? You get to a place, each one gets starchy, and gets off, and they can't receive new revelation. They're settled down; and there they are, and there they die. And the Life goes right through that, and goes right on to make the wheat. And when the wheat comes, that Life that's traveled through that wheat, the resurrection, brings the whole thing out; yes, brings up for the Rapture. [I Thessalonians 4:15-17]\n\nL-33 Now, remember, this Message started first with Divine healing, performing miracles. Now, if God let that go through a ordinary church, just like we already had, then it wasn't God. God don't have to show off; He don't--He don't have to do these things, to entertain us, like we Americans are used to (entertainment), but He does it to attract the attention of the people, that He's fixing to do something. [Malachi 4:2]\n\nL-34 Look at Him Hisself when He come. \"The wonderful little prophet, the rabbi, the prophet of Galilee.\" Why, His ministry was wonderful, He was welcome in every church.\n\nL-35 But one day He set down, said, \"I and My Father are One.\" [John 10:25-33] \"Oh, my!\" That was out. \"Away with such a fellow!\" \"Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His Blood, you have no Life in you.\" [John 6:50-61] \"Why, he's a vampire! Get away from such a person!\" See?\n\nL-36 See, there was something had to follow that sign. See, something followed. 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min The shuck held it, but now the shuck pulls away; it has to. And remember, twenty years has passed by and no more denominations has come out of it, and it won't. We're at the end of denominations, the wheat's taken shape. But what's the matter with the wheat now, you can't... it must lay in the Presence of the Son, to ripen, before the combine picks it up.\n\nL-37 Now, the events that we see taking place, it's absolutely showed in the Bible, of every age. We think we're all out of cater, but we're not, everything's moving just exactly with God's Word.\n\nL-38 Now, the Bible is a different book from any other sacred book. There's no book like the Bible, because the Bible is God in word form. See? It's... A word is a thought expressed. God's thinking expressed It, His Words through the prophets; and they wrote the Bible, which is in word form. And Jesus called It, \"a Seed.\" And any seed will bring forth of its kind if it's in the right condition, the right atmosphere. Now, this Book of... is a... This Book of prophecy, It--It is foretelling future events. Now, the Book contains the entire revelation of Jesus Christ. You don't add to It or take from It, and every revelation must come by It. See, it must be the Word. [Luke 8:11], [I Peter 1:23], [Revelation 22:18-19]\n\nL-39 So people say, \"I had a revelation.\" Yes, we know Joseph Smith and many had revelations and things, but was contrary to the Word.\n\nL-40 It's got to come according to the Word if it comes from God, because it's to vindicate or to prove God's Presence. And He foreknew all these things, being... By His fore-knowledge He ordained, foreordained (it's called in the Bible, \"predestinated\") every age to its place, and every man to its place, and every messenger to its place. He is God, the Devil ain't pulling nothing over on Him. And He's God, and He has ordained everything to take place, and falls just exactly in line with His Word. [Romans 8:29] So if we can see, by His Word, what age and what time we're living, you'll see it right here in the Bible, of this age, what we're supposed... what's supposed to take place at this time.\n\nL-41 Now, the--the other books, we find lots of books that they call \"sacred books,\" and so forth. And I've read the--the Koran and many others. But, you see, their--their sacred books are only a code of ethics, of morals, or of theology.\n\nL-42 But this Book is a Prophet, It's a different from any other book. The Bible is the Word of God foretelling the future. It foretells because It's forewarned. [II Peter 1:20-21]\n\nL-43 If God sends anything, He says and promised in the Bible that He would no nothing upon the earth until first He revealed it to His servants the prophets. That's Amos 3:7. He... and God cannot lie. He reveals It, that's been His way of doing it all down through the ages. He's never failed to do it. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-44 Now, we are promised, in the last days, for this to be restored. There'll be no--no church, no denomination, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostals, they'll never (in their modern conditions) ever take this church to a Bride. They can't do it, they fail. They're too much at one another's throats, and worldliness has creeped in, and so forth, and--and they died right in their tracks. And so God knows that. [Matthew 17:11]\n\nL-45 And to reveal this Word, one say, \"Well, I got this. And bless God, It's like that.\" That's just the way it was when Jesus came the first time; everyone has a doctrine, everyone had this. It'll have to be something sent to us from God. And God's promised it. And the only way He'll do, is--is keep His same pattern. He promised to send us, in this last days, according to Malachi 4, a prophet upon the earth, \"That would turn the hearts of the people back, the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers again.\" He promised that in His Word. Luke 17 and many other places that He promised it, that He... what He would do in these last days to bring this thing to a vindicated Word. [Malachi 4:5-6], [Luke 17:30]\n\nL-46 See, a man can say anything, but 'less God interprets that Word... See, now, we have our own interpretation, we say It means this. And this one, Methodist, says this, the Baptist says this, the Pentecostal said this, the Oneness says this, the Twoness says this. And, oh, my, there you are. But God don't need no interpreter, He's His Own interpreter. He interprets His Own Word by vindicating It in the age that It's purposed for, the age that It's given for. [Genesis 1:3]\n\nL-47 We're not living in a Pentecostal age, we're living in another age. See, we're not living in a Methodist age, we're living in another age. We're living on up here to the Bride age, the calling out of the Church and getting It together for 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min the Rapture. That's the age that we're now living. To my honest opinion that's exactly the Truth. [I Thessalonians 4:17], [Romans 8:30], [II Timothy 1:9]\n\nL-48 And this Book is a book of prophecy. Its believers are commanded to honor It and to read It, and believe Its Author, for every Word that's written in there must come to pass. Everything that's been promised has to come to pass, because It is Jesus Christ in each age. The same yesterday, it was Jesus Christ, was in Noah; it was Jesus Christ in Moses, it was Jesus Christ in David, it was Jesus Christ in Joseph; it's Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. And it's Jesus Christ among His people today, doing the things that He promised He would do in this age. It's Jesus Christ. [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-49 But the church has become so starchy, so far away, like the brother said here. And--and our churches are becoming the same way, until we've got to have something to shake us back to the Word. How do we know it's going to do it? It's got to come according to God's Own plan. It cannot come by layman, it will not come by the businessman, it cannot come by churches. God has laid down His plan. [II Thessalonians 2:3-12]\n\nL-50 I spoke here in Shreveport the other day, on a national broadcast across the nation, that, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God's Will. David tried to bring the ark of God back into the house. He was anointed king. Why, he--he consulted his--his delegates, his captains of thousands, and ten thousands, and so forth. And they all said, \"That's the Word of the Lord.\" And he consulted the priest, \"That was wonderful.\" And they all got so inspired, they shouted, they done every religious act that was. And they was absolutely contrary to God's will, because there was a prophet in the land by the name of Nathan and he wasn't even consulted about it. See? And we found out it didn't work though they were sincere, trying to do God a service. [I Chronicles 13:1-13], [I Chronicles 15:2-3, 12-28]\n\nL-51 And you can be ever so sincere; but, until we know what we're doing, you're fighting at the air. Come back into the Word of God and get lined up, and then go; then you know. Like a--a soldier, don't know what to do until he gets orders to do it. We must be Christian soldiers, and get orders from the Bible for this hour now; not the charge yesterday, the charge the day before, but the charge today (which way we go). Find out the hour that we're living in.\n\nL-52 And these modern events is slipping by us too swiftly, and one day we're going to find out we'll be left behind without nothing, and be caught, sealed into the mark of the beast before we know it. [Matthew 24:37-44]\n\nL-53 Now, and with patience we have to wait for this, for the prophecies that's promised, every one of them must be fulfilled in its age. For It foretells us, the Author has before done this, and we wait to see Him do it again. What a time it is that we're living in! Something like a--a calendar; you look at the calendar to find out what day of the year you're living in, and you look at God's Bible to see what age we're living in. We're not living in the Methodist age, the Baptist age. We're living in the Bride age, the calling, bringing back to God through a channel that He promised to bring it back in. He promised to do it.\n\nL-54 But as it's been in every age, people let man put their own interpretation to It by theology, and will not believe God's Divine vindication of It (that's, God's interpretation); not what I say, what somebody else says; but what God has promised and what God does, proves that it's God doing His Own interpreting of His Word. [I Thessalonians 4:15-17]\n\nL-55 They told you Pentecostals, forty-five, fifty years ago. Your mothers and fathers, when they were genuine pentecostals, come out of a organization and cursed the thing and walked out of it. Then like a dog to its vomit, went right back in it again. Done the same thing that killed that church, you killed your own by the same thing. Nothing against the people in there, nothing against it, it's the systems of the thing that's what's doing it. [II Peter 2:22]\n\nL-56 Home, I'm... go home... I don't preach this in other man's meeting. I'm going to preach The Trail Of The Serpent, and listen to it if you take the tapes.\n\nL-57 And, notice, they missed seeing the confirmation of the prophecies of God's Word being fulfilled. If those priests... They had it fixed up just exactly the way the Messiah was going to come, they knowed what was going to take place. The--the Pharisees had their idea, the Sadducees, Herodians, and, oh, they had their ideas. But He come not... He come contrary to every one of them, but exactly with the Word. Jesus said the same thing was here: \"If you would have known Me, you should have known My day. If you had knowed, you'd... You say, 'Well, Moses! We have Moses.'\" 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min Said, \"Why, if you would believe Moses, you'd believe Me; because, he wrote of Me.\" [John 5:46]\n\nL-58 But, see, when God was confirming exactly what He promised, they had it in some kind of a dignified way that Jesus was supposed to come, and the... I mean the Messiah. The Messiah had to come right to their group or he wasn't Messiah. Well, it's that way, almost, today, \"If you don't see through my glasses, you're not looking at all.\" See, and so that's--that's just the way it--it is. We... That's the truth. We hate to think that, but it's absolutely the Truth.\n\nL-59 In Hebrews 1:1, God in sundry times wrote the Bible by His Own chosen way. He never wrote It by theologians, neither does He interpret by theologians. There never was a time that--that the theologians ever had an interpretation of the Word of God. The interpretation comes only to a prophet. And the only way we're ever going to get out of this mess is for God to send us that prophet, just exactly, the only way it's going to be done. It's been believed, watched for, and--and fulfillment. [Hebrews 1:1], [II Peter 1:20]\n\nL-60 See, It was not wrote by man, but It was wrote by God. It's not a man's book, It's not a theologian's book. It's the Book of God, which is a Book of prophecy wrote by the prophets and interpreted by the prophets. The Bible said, \"The Word of the Lord comes to the prophets.\" Exactly! [I Kings 21:17-18], [II Kings 1:17], [II Chronicles 11:2-4], [Jeremiah 1:11]\n\nL-61 How beautiful that was illustrated, or, demonstrated when Jesus was come on earth, and John was the prophet of that day, and he--he was prophesying. They said, \"Oh, you mean to say that God's going to tear down our big associations here and all these things? And there's going to be a time, when our--our temples won't no more be worshipped in?\"\n\nL-62 He said, \"There was coming a time when God would make a sacrifice out of the Lamb of God, a man.\" And he said that--that he would know Him when He come. And he said... He was so sure of his message, he said, \"He's standing right among you now and you don't know it.\" He's right among you and you don't know it. [John 1:26]\n\nL-63 And one day when Jesus walked out, John looked up and seen that sign above Him, he said, \"Behold, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.\" That same minute Jesus knowed then that He was a-vindicated before the people. Now, He was the Word, would we doubt that? The Bible said He was the Word, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\" And here He is, the... Here's the Word on earth (look! perfectly!) comes right out into the water to the prophet. [John 1:29, 36], [John 1:1]\n\nL-64 That's right, the Word always comes to His prophet. So we can't expect It to come to theologians. We can't expect It to come to denominations. It's got to come God's channel now that He foretold us about, and that's the only way It'll ever come. It'll be hated, despised, rejected. When It does come, It'll be throwed out to one side, and everything, but God'll do it anyhow. It was rejected in Jesus Christ, it was rejected in John, it was rejected by Jeremiah, it was rejected by Moses. It's always that way. But God moves right on in the way that He promised He would do it. Yes, sir, He never does fail to do it the same way. [II Samuel 7:4-5], [II Samuel 24:11-12], [I Kings 6:11-12], [I Kings 17:2-3], [I Kings 18:1]\n\nL-65 The man who's seen the vision or heard His voice, never altogether understood It. In many cases he didn't know, because he's just an instrument of God. It's God's thoughts expressed through man's lips; a thought, course, is a word expressed. God does His own choosing by His--His predestinated choosing. He done it in every age, He set forth the man for each age. Like when Moses, when he was to fulfill what He told to Abraham. Moses was borned a proper child, he couldn't help being that way. He was born that way because he was borned for that purpose. [Hebrews 11:23]\n\nL-66 And so we find out that God does that in every age. God does His own choosing by His own predestinated choosing, choose His prophets and things for the age. Fixes--fixes his nature, the man's nature, the man's style of preaching, to honor his gift, and all that He does is to meet the challenge of that day. God creates that man and sent him. And in His own mind, as I preached on last night, we are a germ of the gene of God. He knowed that man would be there at that age, before there ever was a molecule, or a light, or anything else in the earth. [Deuteronomy 10:15], [John 6:70], [John 15:16, 19], [II Thessalonians 2:13]\n\nL-67 For you're a gene of your father, and you were in your father, yet your father had no fellowship with you because 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min he... You was in there, but you knew it not and he knew it not, but you was manifested that you might... that he might fellowship with you. And you being borned again, you're borned of Eternal Life. And that's the only one form of Eternal Life, and that's God's Life, Zoe, the Greek word \"Zoe,\" only one form of Eternal Life. [I John 1:1-3]\n\nL-68 Then if you are a son of God or a daughter of God, you were in God all the time. But He knew what bed and time that you'd be planted. So now you're made a creature, a son of God, manifested son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour, the Message that's coming forth in this time. That's right! You was done there before the foundation of the world. If it wasn't... If you wasn't chose that way, no matter how much you try to impersonate It, you'll never make it. How can you get blood from a turnip when there's no blood in there? [Romans 8:19]\n\nL-69 That's the reason I try to say about... Then people thinking we was... we're hollering at women about short hair, and people telling me about saying those things, \"You're going to ruin your ministry.\" Ruin a ministry that God Himself ordained? Far be it! And when people hear the Word of God... When a baby is conceived in the womb of a mother, when that one cell goes in there, another cell builds on top of that. It's not one cell of a human, the next of a dog, and the next of a cat, and the next of something else; it's absolutely, straightly, human being. And when a man is borned of the Spirit of God, he don't inject anything into his life, It's unadulterated Word of God vindicated for that hour. He takes the full Word of God, he don't put no creeds, nothing else into It. It's purely unadulterated, God's Word made manifest among us. [II Corinthians 11:5-6, 13-16]\n\nL-70 Look in the Bible, you see where, what age we're living in then, when you see these great things being made manifest. When God promised to do it, He always does it at the end of each age when the church is come to the turning place, and is turned from the Word back to sin and worldliness. Worldliness is sin. The Bible said, \"If you love the world or the things of the world, the love of God's not even in you.\" [I John 2:15]\n\nL-71 Speaking last night, I was speaking about the--the sacrifice that was offered, the Lamb. It was to be seven days, representing the seven church ages. There was to be no leaven found amongst the people, no leaven for seven days. That means that there's nothing mixed with It, It's unleavened, constantly. And we don't want no creeds, leavens and things mixed with us. We don't want world mixed with us. It's got to be the unleavened Bread of God, the Word of God, the unadulterated Word of God, which, \"Man shall live by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.\" [Exodus 12:19], [Exodus 13:17], [Matthew 4:4], [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-72 Our denominational systems, and differences and things, has put leaven in us, and this and that and world and fashion. And, oh, it's got so it's almost Hollywood everywhere. It'll finally come it'll be like England, and a altar call will be ashamed. My! As brother said, \"How can you get the fish in the boat?\" That's right. [I Corinthians 5:6-8]\n\nL-73 We've got to have the Gospel preached in Its fulness, with the power of God to vindicate that according to the promise of that age and prove that that's exactly God's will. Outside of That you're just a church member, no matter how much you try, you try to do God a service. You might go to the stitch-and-sew party, you might be ever so faithful to church; but unless that germ of Eternal Life was foreordained in you, to be a son or daughter of God, you'll grow up a deformed something; but never be a real, true son or daughter of God. [Acts 13:48]\n\nL-74 Often give my little story of a little eagle. How the farmer set the hen one time, and he had... I hope it don't sound sacrilegious to you. But a farmer set a hen, and she was... lacked one egg in having a setting. I doubt whether anybody here know what a setting eggs is, how much it consists of. But, anyhow, he lacked one egg, didn't have enough. So he robbed the eagle's nest, she had two eggs. And he put the egg under the hen.\n\nL-75 When that eagle was hatched amongst all them chickens, he was a funny bird. He couldn't understand the clucking of the hen, didn't talk like his... like he wanted to hear her talk. And she scratched in the barnyard, and eat from the barnyard, it wasn't food for him. He was an ugly duckling among them. The hen would cluck and he didn't understand it. She'd go this way and eat this and eat that, he didn't understand it. So one day his mammy, or mother, rather, to you. I... In the South we say \"Mammy.\"\n\nL-76 So, anyhow, he... his--his--his mother knowed she had two eggs, and only one of them was there, she went after 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min the other one. She circled every... crossed the country, and finally she flew over the barnyard. She seen him down there following that old hen. She screamed, \"Junior! You're not a chicken, you're an eagle!\" That sounded just right to him. Why? He was an eagle to begin with.\n\nL-77 And when a man or woman has set under creeds and cold, formal religion, if he's ordained to be a son of God, and he sees the Word of God preached in Its power, and God vindicate It; he's an eagle to begin with, he'll run to It as sure as two two's is four. He can't help it, because his very nature loves the Word of God. I don't care what anybody else says, when he sees the Word of God being made manifest, he flies to It because he was a little eagle. [John 4:7-30]\n\nL-78 As they go on to say, he said, \"Mama, how am I going to get up from here?\" And He said, \"Just make a jump, I'll catch you.\" And that's the only thing you have to do, is make one jump to your feet, one jump to God, one promise, \"Lord Jesus, I believe You with all my heart. I believe the Message of the hour. I see It confirmed, and I know It's right.\" Jump to your feet, Mama will catch you. Don't worry, you're an eagle, she'll be right there to get you.\n\nL-79 Now, we realize that we're living in a tremendous time and a great time, but when the truths of this Bible, believers has seen that vindicated, the very vindication of It is the evidence that God is in It. Absolutely! It's then that the promised Word, that God promised, is made known. The seed is bursted forth, and they see It and they believe It. Others just can't see It, somehow they'll set and look at It.\n\nL-80 You know, I've preached hard enough to--to... across this country, that it shouldn't be a short-haired woman in the country. But, every time I come back, there's more. What's the matter? There's something wrong! You know the Word says that! You say, \"Well, that don't make any difference.\" It does make a difference!\n\nL-81 There's a fine brother, said, \"I'm going to lay hands on you, Brother Branham. I love you. You're ruining your ministry.\" Said, \"You ain't got no business telling them women about that.\" Said, \"Let the pastors do it.\"\n\nL-82 I said, \"They don't do it though.\" I said, \"Now...\" He said, \"Well, it's not your business, you just pray for the sick.\" I said, \"Whose business is it, then? I was called to preach the Gospel.\" Said, \"I'll lay hands on you and ask God to take it away, then.\" I said, \"You'll let--let me lay hands on you, too.\" See? And I said, \"I'll pray that God will open your eyes and you'll see It.\" So, that's right!\n\nL-83 He said, \"You ought to preach... The people believe you to be a servant, a prophet of God.\" He said, \"You ought to teach them women how to--to get great gifts and prophesy and things.\"\n\nL-84 I said, \"How can I teach them algebra when they won't even believe their ABC's?\" That's right! So you--you can't do it. That's just in every... That's right. If you can't do the common things, how you going to do the spiritual things? The natural things. Certainly! Brother, sister, it might sound like a joke, but It's the Gospel! It's the Gospel Truth. That's right!\n\nL-85 Notice, we find today that people... There's many people just can't believe It, even Spirit-filled people. I'm going to give you one that'll choke you. The baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in, not at all, not on that, don't have anything to do with your soul. That's the baptism, see. Here's the inside soul, in here, that has to come from God. But then on the outside you have five senses, and five out... inlets to your... contact your earthly home. The inside, you have a spirit, and in there you have five outlets: your conscience, and love, and so forth, five outlets to that spirit. Remember, in that spirit you can be baptized with the genuine Spirit of God and still be lost. It's the soul that lives, that was ordained of God. [Acts 1:5, 8], [Acts 11:16], [John 1:33]\n\nL-86 Didn't Jesus say, \"Many will come to me in that day, and say, 'Lord, haven't I cast out devils, done great and mighty works, prophesied, the great gifts of God?'\" He said, \"Depart from me, you that work iniquity, I never even knew you. Many will come in that day.\" [Matthew 7:22-23]\n\nL-87 Didn't Caiaphas prophesy? He was a devil. We find out there... And them priests, them great man, was supposed to be great leaders in them days, with humility and everything else, but failed to see the Word of God Itself made 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min manifest before them.\n\nL-88 We could just take a bunch of them I got wrote down here. How about Balaam? He was a... You say, \"God changes His mind.\" He doesn't change His mind!\n\nL-89 When Balaam went out as a prophet, and went down there, a bishop, preacher, whatever you want to call him, he was a great man. But when he consulted God about going down there and cursing Israel; he didn't like them to begin with, so he asked to go. God said, \"Don't go!\"\n\nL-90 Then they sent a dignitary about some... maybe of bishops or presbyters, or something, down, said... more educations to persuade him. He went back and asked God again. You don't have to ask God the second time! When God says it first, that's It! You don't have to wait anything.\n\nL-91 Rebekah didn't wait to get the second order. They asked her, said, \"Will you go?\" \"Let her say.\" She said, \"I'll go!\" She was firmly inspired of God. She become one of the queens of the Bible for acting upon the pulsation of the Spirit of God that moved upon her to receive what was absolutely the truth, and she believed it.\n\nL-92 Now we find out, Balaam, of course, he couldn't see. He went out and looked upon the people, said, \"Now, just a minute! We're a great, big people up here, you're just a scattered bunch.\" You see? \"And we all--we all believe the same God.\"\n\nL-93 That's true. They all believed the same God, and they all worshipped Jehovah. Look at Balaam's sacrifice: seven altars, God's perfect number; the seven churches, see; seven rams, speaking of the coming of the Lord. Fundamentally, he was just as fundamental as Moses was; but, you see, there wasn't a Divine vindication. In there, they were both prophets. [Numbers 23:1, 29]\n\nL-94 But under Moses' ministry, there was a supernatural Pillar of Fire, a Light that hung with the camp. There was Divine healing, there was a shout of the King in the camp, great signs, Divine healing, and wonders and things performed among them. It was a sign of a living God among His people. [Exodus 13:21], [Numbers 14:14], [Nehemiah 9:12]\n\nL-95 Fundamentally, they was both right. And Balaam tried to persuade the people, and bewitched them into it. When? Just before they reached the Promised Land. Another day or two, they'd a-been in the Promised Land.\n\nL-96 But now I'm afraid... This is a hard mark to make, some of these days I'll be shot for It. But remember this, that, the churches are being bewitched by this Ecumenical Council, he's taking you right into it, to say \"You're the same group.\" You're not the same group! Come out from among that stuff and be separated! Certainly is, It's true. We're to keep away from that stuff, as far as you can from it.\n\nL-97 Balaam said, \"We're... let's let our children marry together because, after all, we believe the same God.\"\n\nL-98 \"How can two walk together 'less they be agreed?\" How can you walk with God 'less you agree with His Word? How can you add creeds and so forth to It, when you're ordained not to do it, or, commanded not to do it? You can't do it. There's no way of doing it, brother, sister. You can't mix that leaven with the unleavened. Oil and water will not mix. Darkness and light will not mix. Light's so much powerful, it just puts the darkness out. [Amos 3:3]\n\nL-99 And so we cannot mix it together. Neither can you mix sin of the world together. You can't mix Church and denomination together. You can't mix Church and creed together. You can't mix the world and the Gospel together. It won't mix! \"Come out from among them, be ye separated,\" saith God, \"I'll receive you to Myself. You'll be My sons and daughters, I'll be God to you.\" We can never do it until these things are manifested, and the Word of God for the hour is proved to be the Truth. Follow in the footsteps. [II Corinthians 6:17]\n\nL-100 Pentecost, that's why Luther lost his message. That's how Wesley lost his message. See, if the Wesleyan church would have went on, they'd been Pentecostals. If the Lutherans went on, they'd a-been Methodists. See? And now if the Pentecostals go on, it'll be the Bride. If you hang back and keep going back in the world like you're going now, you'll be lost! It'll only be the shuck, and the stalk is to be burned. We know that. He will gather His wheat into the garner. 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min But the husks He'll burn with unquenchable fire, although it was a carrier. It certainly carried, but the Life left it as soon as it become a leaf, it went on out to make something else until it come to its full statue. [Matthew 3:12], [Luke 3:17]\n\nL-101 And so will the Church come through Justification, Sanctification, Baptism of the Holy Ghost (restoration of gifts), right on into the formed image of Christ. Christ is the Bridegroom, the Church is the Bride, and the Bride is a part of the Bridegroom. It'll have to be a Word Church, not a denominational church. It'll be the Word Church, the Word that's made known, and by the vindicated Word of God.\n\nL-102 Balaam, he couldn't see the difference. Many can't.\n\nL-103 Pharaoh couldn't see It, though It vindicated right before him.\n\nL-104 Dathan couldn't see It. Dathan come out there, and he seen Moses and knowed. He went out there, said, \"You try to think you're the only one in the bunch. The whole congregation is holy!\" God never did deal like that. He ought to have knowed better than that. And he said, \"Well, the whole congregation is holy. You try to make yourself...\" If we'd say it today, the street expression, \"The only pebble on the beach.\" [Numbers 16:1, 3]\n\nL-105 And Moses knew that God had sent him down there for that. He just said, \"Lord...\" fell in the--the doorway of the tabernacle.\n\nL-106 And God said, \"Separate yourself from him.\" And He swallowed them up. [Numbers 16:21]\n\nL-107 And remember, the sin that Israel did (by Balaam saying, \"They're all the same.\"), that sin never was forgiven Israel. And look, let me give you a striking figure; out of two million that left Egypt, two of them went into the Promised Land. Every one of them eat the same thing, they all danced in the Spirit, they all had everything in common; but when it come to the separated time, the Word done the separating. So is it today! The Word done the separating! When it come time, he said, \"Why, here, we're...\"\n\nL-108 So close, look, the Bible said, \"In the last days the two spirits,\" Matthew 24:24, \"would be so close, it would deceive the very Elected if it was possible.\" That shuck looks just exactly like the wheat, but it ain't the wheat. See? It isn't the wheat, but it looks just exactly like it. See? So close, it would deceive the very Elected. You denominated and fall into that denomination, and dry up and die, and the wheat moved right on out through the... See? That's exactly right! It's a carrier, but not the wheat. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-109 Remember, the wheat just keeps going on. In the resurrection all that strength of the wheat will come right up into the wheat, as it goes to make the head, to come out in the great resurrection. Never forgiven!\n\nL-110 Let's stop here just a moment. I hope I don't choke you out. But, look, let me ask you something. Let's just take that. Say, for instance, this count would be right. When the sperm from male and female come, if you ever known test tubes or--or hybriding and so forth of cattle, you'll find out that the discharge from the male puts out about a million germs. And the discharge from the female puts out a million eggs. But did you know there's only one of them that's fertile? Them little calves, or whatever they are, in these millions of germs, a million germs, there'll be that one little germ will work itself up among the rest of them germs and go right over and find that fertile egg and crawl into it, and the rest of them die. One of them is ordained to life, the others are not, though they're all the same. One out of a million!\n\nL-111 What if it'd be that way tonight? There's five hundred million, supposed to be, I think, Christians in the world, about that figure, just a round figure. If the rapture would come tonight then, in the living going, there'd only be five hundred people. Well, there's that many missing any day, almost, that they can't 'count for. The Bride will be taken away and we'd wonder what it's all about; and the people going right on preaching, saying they're \"getting this or that, and the other,\" and look what a deception that would be. Say if it would be that; I don't say it is, I don't know, I'm no authority of that. God's the judge of that. But look how easy it could happen, in all figures and things, how it could be proven.\n\nL-112 Why didn't Korah see That? Why didn't Dathan see That?\n\nL-113 Why didn't Ahab see It? When Ahab... When Jehosaphat went down to Ahab, he said, \"Ahab, we're in trouble. 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min Do you know God gave us this land, Joshua divided it up? You know this piece of ground up here that the Syrians taken, isn't that our ground?\" \"Yes!\"\n\nL-114 \"Our children's hungry, and the Syrians (our enemy) are feeding their children, filling their bellies with the wheat that ought to be ours.\" That's scripturally right. Said, \"Will you help me to go up there and take that?\"\n\nL-115 Now, sometimes a good man under the influence of evil will give in. Better watch, church, watch real close.\n\nL-116 Now, the first thing you know, Jehosaphat, being a great religious man, he said, \"Well, we should go up, sure, to our church, we're all the same people.\" But they wasn't the same people! No! He said, \"Well, our church is your church, our people is your people. Sure, we'll go,\" he said, \"but let's consult the Lord first.\" [I Kings 22:5, 7-8]\n\nL-117 So he said, O Ahab, \"No doubt, we should have thought of that. Well, we'll...\" \"Is there a prophet of the Lord?\" Said, \"I got a seminary full of them. I got four hundred down here, the best ones there is. They all got their Ph.D., L.L.D., their double L.D.'s, and everything else that goes with it. They're every one...\" Now remember, they were Hebrew prophets, from a school of prophets. Said, \"Bring them up, let's hear them.\"\n\nL-118 Now, I believe it was Zedekiah (the great head over the bishop, all of them) come up there, and he had the inspiration. He had inspiration, absolutely. He come up there, and made himself two big iron horns. He said, \"You know, THUS SAITH THE LORD, 'You're going to take these horns and push the Syrians plumb out of the country.'\" [I Kings 22:11]\n\nL-119 Well, all the rest of them prophesied, \"That's exactly right!\" Every one of them, the whole seminary, in agreement. See? [I Kings 22:12] Ahab said, \"You see?\"\n\nL-120 Jehosaphat, being kind of spiritual, you know, he hadn't dried up altogether, he said, \"But isn't there just another one somewhere, that we could consult?\" [I Kings 22:7]\n\nL-121 \"What do you want to consult others, when the whole Ecumenical (the whole council), it says 'It's all right'?\" (Excuse me, see.) \"The whole thing said, 'That's what we ought to do.'\" See? \"That's what we should do.\"\n\nL-122 He said, \"But isn't there just another one somewhere?\" That odd one, you know. He said, \"Yes, there is. There's one, Micaiah the son of Imla, but I hate him.\" Always that way. \"I hate him because he's always just bawling our people out, and cursing me, and telling me all the evil about me. I hate the man!\" [I Kings 22:8] Said, \"Ah, don't let the king say so.\" Said, \"Go get him.\"\n\nL-123 So they went over there to the son of Imla, some of the--the bishops, or, some of the elders, and went over there, said, \"Now, listen, do you want to get back in the organization again? You say the same thing that they say, they bring you back.\"\n\nL-124 But there happened to be that God had a man that they couldn't put their hands on him; God had His hands on him. He was just the reflector of God's Truth. Said, \"Sure,\" said, \"I'll go down, but I'll only say what God puts in my mouth.\" There's the man of God. He said, \"Give me the night.\" So the night come, and the Lord spoke to the prophet, little nobody. And first thing you know, he come out the next morning. Said, \"What about it, Imla?\" [I Kings 22:14]\n\nL-125 He said, \"Go on up,\" said, \"but I seen Israel scattered like sheep on a hill, having no shepherd.\" [I Kings 22:17]\n\nL-126 He said, \"What did I tell you! What did I tell you about it!\"And he said... [I Kings 22:18]\n\nL-127 Then the big bishop walked up and slapped him in the mouth, said, \"Which way did the Spirit of God go? Cause I know I had the Spirit; I danced in It, I done all these things. See, I--I had the Spirit on me. Which a way did It go?\"\n\nL-128 Now, see, Imla being a son of God, or a real prophet of God, he examined his vision with the Word. If it wasn't 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min with the Word, it's wrong. See? The Word for that hour, see. Now, he said scripturally, the land belonging to them, the land was theirs. Scripturally, everything seemed to be right but one thing.\n\nL-129 Remember, it was one Word that caused the whole mess to come, Eve disbelieved one Word of God; in the first of the Bible, one Word caused the trouble. Jesus, come in the middle of the Bible, said, \"Man shall live by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.\" At the end of the Bible, said, \"Whosoever shall take one Word out or add one word to It.\" [Matthew 4:4], [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-130 It's not part of the Gospel... The Methodists have part, the Baptists, Presbyterians, and so forth, they had part of It, Catholic had part of It, Jehovah Witness, all the rest of them.\n\nL-131 But It's the whole Word, all the Word, the Word of the hour; what counts. And we'll never do it until God anoints a prophet that can stand and tell It, and confirms him, and prove It that It's right. It'll slip right through the people and they'll never know It, just like it's always been.\n\nL-132 You Catholic, like Joan of Arc, you burned her at the stake for being a witch; later you dug up them priests' bodies, two hundred years later, and throwed them in the river. You didn't know Saint Patrick and the rest of them.\n\nL-133 It'll go right through your hands again, the first thing you know. God will do it, and you'll never even know it's done. See, He just slips right through and gets His Bride and takes Her right on up, and steals Her away, right out of the midst of the people.\n\nL-134 We find out, this little Micaiah said he examined, he knowed that God had said to a real prophet before him. The prophet before him, what did he say? He said this, he said, \"Ahab, because you shed the righteous, or the blood of the righteous Naboth, the dogs will lick your blood also, and Jezebel.\" And that's just exactly, had to come to pass because God had said it. How could that prophet prophesy good when it was evil against it? [I Kings 21:19]\n\nL-135 How can I tell this Laodicean Church Age the good things when God spoke against it? You're naked, miserable! You say, \"I'm rich, I have better... I have churches like the Methodist, and the Baptists, and the Presbyterians. I have this, I have that; the best this, that, and the other.\" That's right, but don't know that you're naked, blind, miserable, to the real thing that God is manifesting. It'll go right through you, like that, moving right out. See? Believe, people, before it's too late. [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-136 Now, we find out that he smote him in the mouth, and said, \"Which way did the Spirit of God...?\"\n\nL-137 Micaiah said, \"I seen God setting upon the Throne. And all... He called the delegates of Heaven, said, 'Who can we get to go down and deceive Ahab?'\" Said, \"And one lying spirit come up and fell before God; a liar.\" And remember, that lying spirit got into those prophets, they ought to have knowed then that the spirit was upon them wasn't according to the Word. But they were so carried away because they were the king's prophets, because they had everything fine. [I Kings 22:19]\n\nL-138 And that's what the church has done today. You've got away from that old-fashioned experience you had years ago when you stood on the street corner and preached the Gospel. Come out of those organizations and call yourself \"a free people!\" Nay! because you're wrapped in it again, like a hog to its wallow or a dog to its vomit. If it made him vomit the first time, it'll make him vomit again. That's right! God spewed you from His mouth, He said, \"You're lukewarm, neither hot or cold\"; have a few meetings, then play a few... musicians, sing a little bit, when, it's absolutely... it's almost become a disgrace to Christianity. [II Peter 2:22], [Revelation 3:16]\n\nL-139 My son called me over the other day to look at a television, supposed to be singing bee where the people come. That bunch of little Ricky's standing there, shaking around like this rock-and-roll, and singing them hymns, it's a disgrace to Jesus Christ! There's no more solemnity in the church at all. It seems like it's all become a rock-and-roll something, and a fashion show, in the stead of the Church of the living God where Jesus Christ can manifest Himself in power. Seems to be, there is something wrong somewhere. They're slipping away. And the Bible said it would be that way. See? Look where you're at. Be careful, wake up before it's too late.\n\nL-140 Now we find out, He said, \"Who can we get to go out there and deceive Ahab, to get him up there to fulfill that 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min prophet's words?\" See, if the prophet said a Word, heavens and earth will pass away but It can't fail. It's got to come to pass. So that's what, it had to take place. [I Kings 22:20], [Luke 21:33]\n\nL-141 He said, \"Put this man in the inner jail, feed him of bread of sorrow and water of sorrow. When I return in peace, I'll take care of him.\" [I Kings 22:27]\n\nL-142 Micaiah stood there firm, knowing he had the Spirit of God. His prophecy and visions was right. His Message was right, 'cause It was THUS SAITH THE LORD from the visions, THUS SAITH THE LORD from the Word. It had to be right, was THUS SAITH THE LORD. He said, \"If you return at all, God never spoke to me.\" And you know what happened, sure. See, you... [I Kings 22:28] Understand, brother. Listen.\n\nL-143 Sure, Caiaphas, he couldn't see It. Why didn't he look down...? He was a--he was a bishop, he was a pope of all the churches together. Why couldn't that man see Jesus standing there? Why couldn't he understand? When they was singing the 23rd Psalm, the 22nd Psalm, rather, in the church, and, \"My God, My God, why has Thou forsaken Me?\" and there He's hanging on the cross. The very Scriptures, the very God that they were worshipping, they were condemning Him and killing Him for \"a fanatic.\" There it is. [Psalms 22:1]\n\nL-144 It'd shock you if I'd tell you that's just about to repeat again. The Bible said He was on the outside trying to knock to get in, and nobody would let Him in, \"He that I love I chasten and rebuke, I scold him, I shake him down, but it's because I love him. Open up and let Me come in.\" Yeah. Could not... \"Remember, I didn't want to get in the church; it's he, the individual.\" He couldn't get in the church, had Him locked out. Only... then, only organization of all of them, is this church age, that He was on the outside the church. Put out! Refused! Rejected! Because... He was only manifested in temporarily in the other churches, in the form of justification, so forth; but in here, the age that's coming now, is the full manifestation of the vindication of Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Oh, I'll admit we got a lot of impersonators, but examine the first one, the original. [Revelation 3:19], [Hebrews 13:8]\n\nL-145 Moses went down with the commandments of God, to deliver Israel; and when he did, he performed some miracles. The impersonators followed him. If they had been first, he would a-been the impersonator. See, he had the Word of the Lord, and the Lord vindicated; he just set still.\n\nL-146 And, you know, that same thing's promised in the last day? \"As Jambres and Jannes withstood Moses, so will these man of reprobate mind concerning the Truth.\" And when an organization keeps a... takes a man right down through that organization, it showed it did not come from God; because, God does those things to attract the people's mind, and then the Message follows it. If it isn't, then it's not God. It's not God! God always does that. [II Timothy 3:8]\n\nL-147 Judas couldn't understand It. He walked right with Him, he didn't see It.\n\nL-148 But the real, ordained of God, that real gene, that real germ, a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world; remember, you that's really got the Spirit of God in you tonight, you were here in Christ because He was the fulness of the Word. He was the fulness of the Godhead bodily. God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself. Do you believe that? Look, He was in Christ. Then if you were in God, a gene, a word, a attribute from the beginning, then you walked with Him here on earth, you talked with Him on earth, you suffered with Him on earth, you died with Him at Calvary, and you rose with Him again; and now you're setting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, communing with Him (the Word) as It feeds into your soul, that, \"Man shall live by ever Word that proceedeth.\" [II Corinthians 5:19], [Colossians 2:9], [Ephesians 2:6], [Matthew 4:4], [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-149 Not the Methodist word, the Baptist word; remember, if there was any left over in the sacrifice, it must be burned before morning, 'cause tomorrow's another church age. That right? Exodus, It's true. A symbol, type of the Sacrifice.\n\nL-150 The Door. Said, \"I'll make one place. Don't... You won't worship Me in every door that I've give you; but there's one Door, and in that Door I'll put My Name.\" And where the Lord puts His Name, that's the place that God will receive your sacrifice. We've made all kinds of doors, but God made a Door. God made a Door, and that Door was... St. John the 10th chapter, Jesus said, \"I am that Door.\" [John 10:7, 9]\n\nL-151 God put His Name in Jesus. Do you believe that? He was the Son of God. Every son comes in his father's name. 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min He said, \"I come in My Father's Name, you receive Me not.\" I come in my father's name, you come in your father's name. Jesus come in His Father's Name, so His Father's Name is Jesus; exactly, 'cause He came in His Father's Name. [John 5:43]\n\nL-152 \"And you receive Me not. Another will come, and him you will receive.\" You'll take your denominations and go on with them. Just go ahead, the Bible said, \"They were raised up to fulfill this place. Blind, naked, and don't know it.\" Church, religion, oh, very pious, just the same as Cain was; make a sacrifice, make everything just the same as Abel did. But by revelation it was revealed to him what the sacrament was, not fruits of the field and something to do with your hand. [John 5:43], [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-153 The believer can see the Word made flesh; the others cannot do it.\n\nL-154 All them Israelites, after they had seen Moses perform that and brought them right up to the great council, where it was to be held, every one of them said, \"We'll go with Balaam, because we think Dr. Balaam's right. He's smarter, is more educated, everything, so we'll just take it.\"\n\nL-155 And God never did forgive them, He destroyed them right there in the wilderness. And Jesus said, Himself, \"They'll never come, there's none of them saved.\" Jesus said...\n\nL-156 They said, \"Our fathers eat manna in the wilderness for forty years.\" [John 6:31]\n\nL-157 He said, \"They're every one dead, Eternally separated from God. They're every one dead.\" Certainly! Because they listened to an error. When Moses, the vindicated of God, and a leader to show them the way to the promised land, and they had come so far all right, but then they wouldn't go along with him. [John 6:49, 58]\n\nL-158 Now, believers can see It, but unbelievers cannot see That vindicated.\n\nL-159 Look how pious Caiaphas was. Look how all them priest how pious they was. And Jesus turned around, said, \"You are of your father the Devil, and his works you'll do.\"\n\nL-160 But there was a few believers setting there. Do you think them disciples could have understood when Jesus said, \"I and My Father are one\"? They couldn't explained It. When He said, \"Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, drink His Blood, you have no Life.\" Could they explain It? No. But they believed It, because they seen God being vindicated and made flesh. [John 10:30], [John 6:53]\n\nL-161 Jesus said, \"If I do not the works of My Father, then believe Me not. But if I do the works of My Father, the Word that's predicted for Me to do, then you... If you can't believe Me, believe the works that I do, that you might be saved.\" See? Jesus said, \"My sheep know My Voice. They know My Word, they see It when It's vindicated for that age.\" [John 10:27, 37-38]\n\nL-162 \"Well, Caiaphas knowed the Word too!\" But not the Word for that age. He had the word of what the Pharisees had poked into him, but not the vindicated Word of the hour.\n\nL-163 \"They know My Voice, they know My sign, they know My wonder.\" How now, to...\n\nL-164 Oh, let's get back to our text, 'cause we're just going to miss a lot of this Scripture if we don't, 'cause I got to close in the next few minutes anyhow, 'cause it's going to be ten o'clock in a few minutes. I love Him.\n\nL-165 Friends, you people who walked down that aisle and put that offering in there a while ago; people that fed my children, put clothes on their back; the people that's put your money (that you hard earned) in an offering plate, know where that goes? That helps take me overseas to the heathens that never has heard anything about God. That's what I do with it, every penny, God's my judge. Here's some of my... the man's setting right here now that's in--in the treasury of my church. I get one hundred dollars a week, and that's all; rest of it goes to sponsor overseas meetings where they can't come.\n\nL-166 The churches won't have me. They don't want me. No. That's right! They term me now, \"He's...\" They say, \"He's a 'Jesus Only,' or he's something like that, or some heretic, fanatic, and all like that, a--a Jezebel.\" And I--I look for that, they called my Lord, \"Jezebel,\" and they called Him... not a Jezebel, but a \"Beelzebub.\" They called Him all those bad names. \"If they called the Master of the house, 'Beelzebub,' how much more will they call them of His disciples?\" So 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min that don't make any difference. [Matthew 10:25]\n\nL-167 And you yourself, by the help of God, you think I'd stand up here, a big hypocrite, and tell you something...? Or, wouldn't I fall right in line with the thing if I thought it was from God?\n\nL-168 But if I love you and know what's the Truth... Have you ever heard me say anything in the Name of the Lord but what come to pass? No. I ask anybody. There are thousands of things that's been said, they all come to pass. Remember that time when Samuel was called out, I believe it was, and he said...? Israel wanted to make themselves like the rest of the nations. And that's what you Pentecostals are coming to. You want to act like the rest the people. You're not them kind of people. Keep away from it. The big churches and big fine things, O brother, don't do that. We preach the coming of the Lord is at hand, let's get to the fields down there and notify the heathen. See, do something about it.\n\nL-169 But, you see, Samuel said, \"Have I ever at one time taken any of your money from you for my living?\" They said, \"No, Samuel, you never done that.\" Said, \"Did I ever tell you anything in the Name of the Lord but what come to pass?\"\n\nL-170 \"Oh, that's right, Samuel. We believe you're a prophet sent from God. Yes, sir. Everything you said come to pass, Samuel. But we want it anyhow.\" You see what happened. O brother, the Scripture just keeps repeating Itself back and forth through the Scripture, 'cause it's God's way of doing it, you see. You see, you hit these kind of times.\n\nL-171 Let's get to our text right quick. Now, I been all this time, I didn't come to my text yet.\n\nL-172 It's on my heart! I love you! Don't perish with the world! If you're of the world, you'll perish with the world. If you're of God, you'll go with Him in the resurrection. So change your nature tonight from the love of the world and the things of the world, and all these creeds and things, and look straight to Calvary to your Sacrifice; meet Him there on them grounds, 'cause that's the only place He'll ever meet you. He...\n\nL-173 The Methodists says, \"It's in our church\"; the Baptists says, and the Pentecostals, and this, and the Presbyterians, and this.\n\nL-174 But He said, \"I'll meet them in one place, the Place I put My Name.\" That's in Jesus Christ. That's where God put His Name. That's the only place He'll meet you; and it's Christ, is the Word, the same yesterday... It's growed from the feet, thighs. And now it's in the head, fixing to go; manifesting in full measure the Bride, the same as the Groom.\n\nL-175 Now let's go to our text, right quick, for about ten minutes, and then we'll close. Now our text, we... where we want to consider, is, it had happened again, as our text, as it usually has happened.\n\nL-176 God sent His prophet as He... Word had promised of Malachi 3, \"A messenger I'll send before My face to forerun His coming.\" [Malachi 3:1]\n\nL-177 Now if you want to vindicate that, to prove it; Matthew, 11th chapter, vindicates the same. When the disciples of John came over and they seen Jesus, they said, \"John is in prison.\" Said, \"We've come to ask You whether he...\" [Matthew 11:2-5]\n\nL-178 John's eagle eye had been filmed over. And he was in the prison, he was fixing to die; said, \"Go ask Him.\"\n\nL-179 See, John said, \"Oh, His fan's in His hand, He'll thoroughly purge His floor.\" He thought the Millennium would start right then, he thought the grain was ready. But it had to die and go into the stalk, come up again to make the true Bride. So he said, \"He'll gather His wheat into the garner, and He'll burn with fire.\" Watch that--that forerunner of Christ in that age, what he said would happen. \"The grain...\" [Matthew 3:12]\n\nL-180 And I hope you're not asleep. The grain is here! It'll be gathered into the garner. It was that Bride, that part of it. But what did He say will happen to the stalk? It'll be burned with unquenchable fire. Seek salvation now while you can. Be a grain, not a stalk. See? Go into the Life, not the old dead form; go into the Life of Christ, the Word made manifest, the... made manifest and vindicated so. This is the--this is the gathering time, the combine is coming. You'd better get into the grain, 'cause the shuck's going to be left behind. [Matthew 3:12], [Luke 3:17]\n\nL-181 Now, we find out it happened... Jesus... To finish my quotation here, this Matthew 11. See, He didn't give John... He say, \"Now, wait, I'll give John a book on how to conduct himself, A Believer In Jail.\" No! He said, \"Stand around 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min and watch what happens. Go back and show John what happens: the lame walk, the blind see, the dead's raised up, and the Gospel's preached to the poor.\" Just exactly what the prophet said would come to pass. \"And blessed is you who's not offended in Me.\" [Luke 7:22], [Matthew 11:6]\n\nL-182 And his disciples started across the hill, He turned, said, \"What went ye out to see when you went to see John? Did you go to see a man that's cattering in soft raiments, and so forth, the turned-around collars, and all this, you know?\" Said, \"They're in kings' palaces, they kiss the babies and bury the dead, he don't know how to hold a two-handed sword.\" See? Said, \"What'd you go to see? A--a reed that's shaken by any wind, 'Come on, John, I'll give you more money if you come over here'? (\"Well, bless God, I ain't Methodist no more, I'll be Pentecostal, I'll be Presbyterian, I'll be this, that, the one with more money.\") Said, \"You never did see a reed shaken with the wind.\" Said, \"What did you go to see there, a prophet?\" He said, \"Yes, and more than a prophet.\" [Matthew 11:7-9], [Luke 7:24-26]\n\nL-183 John had just paid the poorest tribute he could to Jesus. Know it had to come that way; asked Him after he introduced Him and seen that Sign above Him, he said, \"This is the Messiah,\" then he comes and asks, \"Are you He, or do we look for another one?\" [Matthew 11:3]\n\nL-184 But, look, Jesus knowing that, He turned and give him a tribute, said, \"What did you go to see, a reed shaken with the wind?\" Said, \"There's never been a man borned of a woman as great as John, till this day.\" That's right! What a compliment to pay the man! [Matthew 11:7]\n\nL-185 But, you see, there it was, that prophecy had been fulfilled right before their face, with a forerunner coming, exactly what Malachi said. Now, that's Malachi 3, not Malachi 4. [Malachi 3:1]\n\nL-186 John the Baptist was Malachi 3, Jesus said so. When they asked Him, said, \"Why does the scribes say...\" Said, \"He's already come. They did what they said.\" [Mark 9:11], [Malachi 3:1]\n\nL-187 But, remember, Malachi 4, immediately after the Malachi 4 prophet, the fourth coming of John the Baptist in... or the... of Elijah. The fifth coming will be the Revelation 2, the witnesses, when he comes for the remnant of the Jews. But God has used that same Spirit five times: grace, J-e-s-u-s, it's all been Jesus all the time; f-a-i-t-h, g-r-a-c e, and so forth. You see? The number five is a grace number and He used it. Won't use just three, won't use just two, three, four. It's five times He uses it.\n\nL-188 Now, notice quickly now, as we finish up. He said, \"This is he who was spoken, 'I send My messenger before My face.'\" [Matthew 11:10], [Luke 7:27]\n\nL-189 But in Malachi 4, immediately after that prophet prophesied, the whole earth is to be burnt over, and the righteous walk out upon the ashes of the wicked. See? Exactly! See, that's the Malachi 4 prophecy.\n\nL-190 And notice in Luke 17, where He said, \"In the last days, it'll come like Sodom and Gomorrah again.\" Have we got it? We got Sodom and Gomorrah again? The whole nations, look at it. Look what he just said about England, the whole thing is perverted. Even the food is perverted. And looky here what science... You see in Reader's Digest, I believe it's last month, they said, \"Little boys and girls go through middle age between twenty and twenty-five years old.\" I meet them in the meeting, little girls in menopause, and twenty, twenty-two years old, in menopause. What's it lotted to? The perversion, hybriding. That's exactly what corrupted, the whole thing's corrupted the body. We're nothing but a mess of--of... just like a hybrid plant. [Luke 17:28]\n\nL-191 You take a hybrid plant and set it out there, every germ will run right to it. But a genuine, original plant, a germ will go away from it, he can't stand on it. And that's what's the matter with the church, we've hybrid it.\n\nL-192 That's what's the matter with Pearry Green's old horse up there, and he throwed that boy the other day, he's nothing but an old quarter horse. See? The only thing it is, he... It's just like a mule, he's--he's... a mule don't know who his papa or mama is, he don't know nothing; he's half mule and half horse, and half this and donkey; he don't know what he is. You could never... He'll wait all of his life to get to kick you. That's right! You can call him, say, \"Come on, boy. Come on, boy.\" He'll hold his ears up, and, \"Haw! Haw! Haw!\" See?\n\nL-193 Like some of these saying \"Days of miracles is past, Haw! Haw!\" all these half-breeds, supposed to be church 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min members and Christians. I ain't saying that for a joke, but it's the Truth. But a genuine, thoroughbred, brother, he knows who his father was, who his mother was, who his grandfather, grandmother was, you can teach him something, he's gentle.\n\nL-194 And a genuine Christian that's born of the Holy Ghost and filled with God's power and Word, he knows who his father is, who his mother is, who his grandfather, grandmother was, he knows all about It. You can teach him something. [Romans 8:9, 14]\n\nL-195 But a half-breed, that's what's come to churches. Hybrid between the world and religious organizations, and putting a little Word in it here, a little Word there, just enough to deceive. That's right. When you see the real Word of God being manifested like Caiaphas and them did, they turn away from It, they don't know. Hybrid!\n\nL-196 Now we find out, and in this message, Isaiah 40:3 also vindicated John. He said, \"A voice of one, a prophet, crying in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make His path straight.'\" The church did not believe him, for he was not of their group. That prophet was raised out of a wilderness, come up knowing no one. He had the very Spirit on him that Elijah had: he was a man of the wilderness, he hated immoral women. [Isaiah 40:3]\n\nL-197 Remember how Elijah... What caused his head to be taken from him? Was Jezebel. Jezebel was the cause of his death. It run him into the wilderness.\n\nL-198 John the Baptist, another wilderness-lover, a hunter, a woodsman. Watch him. He had no education. Watch his--his text, wasn't like a theologian. He said, \"O you generation of vipers!\" The filthiest thing you can find in the wilderness, the sneakiness, was a--was a snake. And he called those priests, \"You generation of vipers! Who's warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Don't begin to say, 'We belong to this, and we have this or that,' for I say unto you, God's able of these stones,\" wilderness. Also, \"The axe\" (what he used) \"is laid to the root of the tree; and every tree that don't bring forth good fruit, hewn down and cast into the fire.\" Amen. [Matthew 3:7-9], [Matthew 12:34], [Luke 3:7-8]\n\nL-199 He was a preacher of nature. A great man of God, lived a short time, but certainly set a blaze across the earth. He shocked that generation in them six months of his ministry. God raised him for thirty years, to get that six months out of him. But God does His own way, He knows what His harvest is.\n\nL-200 And we find out now that this is exactly what had took place. They didn't believe him, because he wasn't of them. They didn't. They did as usual, they didn't see It. They did not believe God's Word of Malachi 3, or they would have seen plainly, by the letter, that this was that forerunner. They hadn't had a prophet for four hundred years, and here one rises on the scene all at once. See? And the people, the believers, believed him to be that. See, they did not believe It. They did not believe, 'cause when they seen the letter completely confirmed, what He said He would do, and everything, and seen It clearly vindicated when the Word come right into the water to the prophet. There they stood. [Malachi 3:1]\n\nL-201 There's many argue on that Scripture there about John. See, John said, \"I have need to be baptized of Thee, and why comest Thou unto me?\" [Matthew 3:14]\n\nL-202 Jesus said, \"Suffer that to be so, for thus... but thus it's becoming to us, behooving us (becoming) that we fulfill all that. John, you being a prophet, you know the sacrifice has got to be washed before it's presented. And I am that sacrifice, and you're a prophet and know that.\" Then he suffered Him and baptized Him. See? And he knew it was. [Matthew 3:13-15]\n\nL-203 Look, they laughed at him, called him \"a wild, screaming, unlearned fanatic,\" as usual, that prophet forerunning the first coming of Jesus.\n\nL-204 I don't say that they're... don't have the same impersonations today of--of genuine. They do, they absolutely. But, remember, when you see a bogus dollar there's got to be a real dollar that's made off of. Where you see one impersonating to be a Christian, there's got to be a Christian somewhere; because if there wasn't, that would be the original. You've got to get to the original. But check the first one, and see if the original is just exactly with the promise. If it is, then believe It: the promise for the age.\n\nL-205 Then John's prophecy was vindicated in God's order. The Word came to the prophet and vindicated him truly as 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min that person. [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-206 Again Jesus came in a... different from their understanding of that prophecy. They didn't understand It that way. (Now, we're going down to the end now.) But according to the prophet's Word, It was fulfilled to the letter. The prophecy is fulfilled; but the way they thought It would be, It wasn't that way. Now, how could they have understood and knowed which was right or wrong? To see if it was vindicated by God, if it was God interpreting what He said. There had been false Jesuses raise up, and led a man, a bunch of... four hundred, out in the wilderness and things; but he never proved to make hisself in the Word, you see, like He said.\n\nL-207 Jesus, when He come, He was to be a prophet. That's right! And today, before Jesus comes again, the full manifestation of the person of Jesus Christ is to be manifested in flesh. Think of it! Jesus said, \"As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man, when the Son of man is being revealed.\" What is revealed? Unfolded, made known. The secret had been brought forth, revealed. In the day that the Son of man will be revealed, the world will be in a Sodom condition. We've got it, haven't we? Yeah! How many believes that? It's in a Sodom condition. And that's exactly right! Look where it's setting, now. [Luke 17:28-30]\n\nL-208 Remember, there's always three groups of people in every bunch of people you gather, that's, make-believers, unbelievers, and believers. We have them in every group. They've had them in all time. There was the Sodomites, there was--there was the Lotite, and there was Abraham. [Matthew 13:3-23], [Mark 4:3-20], [Luke 8:5-15]\n\nL-209 The Abraham was a called-out group, he wasn't in Sodom to begin with. Now watch their Message! They'd been looking for a promised son, looked for it for years. God had showed Abraham many great signs and wonders, but here God came down Himself like a man! You say, \"That was an Angel.\" [Genesis 18:2, 16-22]\n\nL-210 Abraham called Him, \"Lord,\" captial L-o-r-d. Any reader of the Bible knows that that capital L-o-r-d is Elohim. \"In the beginning God,\" Lord God, Elohim, the all-sufficient One. Abraham called Him, \"Lord God, Elohim.\" [Genesis 18:1-2, 20-22]\n\nL-211 Now notice, there was two people that went down into Sodom with a message, and they preached to the Sodomites. They didn't perform nothing, but blinded them; which, preaching the Gospel does blind the unbeliever. [Genesis 19:1-11]\n\nL-212 But watch what kind of a sign the Abraham group received!\n\nL-213 Now, we are supposed to be the royal Seed of Abraham, Isaac was the natural seed. But the faith Seed, the faith in the promised Word, the promised Word (don't miss It) was that royal Seed; that was the Seed, Abraham's faith. \"We being dead in Christ, we're Abraham's Seed, heirs with him according to the promise.\" [Galatians 3:16]\n\nL-214 Notice when all that was taking place, down in Sodom there was two ministers down there preaching with a great message.\n\nL-215 There was One set up here with Abraham's group that didn't fool with that group down there. Now watch the One that stayed with Abraham's group, what kind of a sign He give them. He said... Now, remember, his name was Abram a few days before that; and S-a-r-r-a, not S-a-r-a-h (princess). And this Man, with His back turned to the tent...\n\nL-216 The women then were different than they are now. They have to get out and get in their husband's business and everything else, you know; but they didn't do it then, they stayed back behind.\n\nL-217 So they... so them Angels setting there. The Messenger, and He said, \"Abraham, where is your wife (S-a-r-a-h) Sarah?\" How'd He know it? How did He know it? [Genesis 18:9] Abraham said, \"She's in the tent behind You.\"\n\nL-218 He said, \"I'm going to visit you according to the time that I promised you. I'm going to visit you.\" And Sarah kind of laughed to herself. [Genesis 18:14]\n\nL-219 With His back to the tent, and He said, \"Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'How can these things be?'\" If she hadn't been in Abraham, his bride at that time, God would have slayed her. So would we today with all of our unbelief, if we wasn't in Christ. That holds us right there, see. He couldn't hurt or couldn't take Sarah without hurting Abraham. See? 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min [Genesis 18:12]\n\nL-220 And so remember, Jesus said, \"As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man.\" We see everybody agree that the world's in a Sodom condition. I picked up a Los Angeles paper here not long ago, and said, I think it's \"Homosexual is on the increase of twenty or thirty percent in Los Angeles, each year increasing that much.\" It's... Oh, it's horrible! In our government and everywhere, everything's just become a pervert. That's right! The whole thing, the whole system, church and everything else is perverted. It's in a perverted age. [Luke 17:28-30]\n\nL-221 Now I want to ask you theologians something, my brethren. Not I'm speaking against you, my dear brother; I'm here to help you, brother. I'm here to stand on what God's Word says, as I hold your hand and bring this crowd of people out of this stuff. That's right!\n\nL-222 But looky here, we never had had a messenger down in Sodom before that his name ended with a h-a-m till now. We've had a Spurgeon, a Wesley, a Luther, and everything else, but never a international messenger that his name end with h-a-m before. That's right! See, G-r-a-h-a-m, six letters, G-r-a-h-a-m, Billy Graham; that noted evangelist, great work of God, the man is sent from God. He's got that justification down so pat, and he shakes the nation with it, see, like that. There's not...\n\nL-223 Look at Oral Roberts to the Pentecostal denomination. When was there ever one like that?\n\nL-224 Six letters, not seven. Abraham is A-b-r-a-h-a-m, seven. Billy Graham is G-r-a-h-a-m, six.\n\nL-225 Now look at the messengers. Look at the time we're setting, never was a time in history. Look at the same signs that He promised would be give to each group. Look where they're at. Same, exactly, positionally, setting right in order. Nature, the world, everything, setting right exactly to the time.\n\nL-226 Now don't miss It, while we sketch the rest of this Scripture! Quickly now, cause I'm holding you too long. Call... Looky here. And according to the prophet, he came just exactly to the Word, just exactly to the time.\n\nL-227 Now look at the age now where we're living. Aren't we living right in that Sodom time? Watch the messenger to Abraham's group. Watch the numbers, letters, and the numerology of his name. You say, \"There's nothing in a name.\" Don't you never let anybody tell you that. Why did He change Abram's name, to Abraham, Sarra to Sarah? Why did He change Simon to Peter, and all those other? See? Sure there is. Exactly!\n\nL-228 That's the reason I say don't ever call your child \"Ricky,\" or \"Elvis,\" or something. Elvis means \"cat,\" Ricky's a \"rat.\" See, when you say... That's exactly right. Les, or something, don't you never call one of your child... children that. If it is, change it right quickly, people. Don't you... You that... If you believe me to be God's servant, don't tack that name on that poor child. See? No, sir, give him another name besides that. My! I wouldn't have got off on that, 'cause I'm off of my subject, but I said it and it's all over. I... That's how you do, you don't know when you say it. See?\n\nL-229 Called Him, \"Foreign, a fortune teller, a devil, a Beelzebub,\" and said, \"He made Himself God.\" Oh, my! [Matthew 12:24], [Mark 3:22], [Luke 11:15]\n\nL-230 Didn't Isaiah the prophet said, \"He would be called the Mighty God\"? Isaiah 9:6, \"Unto us a child is borned, a son is given, and the government shall be upon His shoulders, and His Name shall be called Counselor, Prince of Peace, and Mighty God, the everlasting Father.\" That's right! Also, St. John 1:1, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\" You believe that? He was just not... He was a prophet, but He was more than a prophet; He was the God-prophet. Why did He have to come? [Isaiah 9:6], [John 1:1]\n\nL-231 Remember, He comes in three son's names. He came first in the name of the Son of man. He never called Himself the \"Son of God.\" You know that. See, He came in the Son of man, a prophet. Jehovah Himself, the Father, called Jeremiah, \"son of man\"; a prophet is son of man. He come...\n\nL-232 Now He come after the Day of Pentecost, He come back in the form of the Holy Ghost, supernatural Spirit. Now He's Son of God.\n\nL-233 In the Millennium He'll be Son of David, setting upon the throne of David. See, He come in... He's Son of God, 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min Son of man, Son of David.\n\nL-234 Oh, the Bible's full of these nuggets. We can't get them all in one night. But it's just fitting to set this now. Tomorrow may never dawn. We may be gone before tomorrow. I may be preaching to a person that'll be dead before in the morning. I could be gone before in the morning. Brother, sister, that's not myth, that's actual facts! We don't know what time we're going, and you'll not have any chance after that last breath leaves your body. Make it right now, don't wait till in the morning, may be too late.\n\nL-235 Notice now, they had done to Him just exactly what the prophets said they would do, just as they are doing to this very same day in the Laodicean Age. If you want to look at it, read Revelation 3, \"Blind, naked, and don't know it. Turning Christ...\" When He begins to reveal Hisself into the seed form again, the same one that went in the ground come back to be the Bride; just the Bride and the Groom, is the same flesh and blood, the same ministry, and the same things, doing just exactly what He done; the Spirit. [Revelation 3:17]\n\nL-236 And here they're impersonating and doing everything else, and each one has got his book and running, and this. Oh, you never heard such sensations! And... [Brother Branham inhales through his nose--Ed.] \"I smell a devil now.\" All this, that, just as unscriptural as it can be!\n\nL-237 And the genuine thing laying right there before them, they walk away, \"They don't belong to my organization.\" My, my, just, see, just blind leading the blind. Won't they all fall in the ditch? Blinded by man's denominational traditions, they put Him out of their church as God said they would do, in Revelation 3; as usual, as prophesied.\n\nL-238 Notice how Jesus sel-... made Hisself known to these disciples, now, and we'll close. These two disciples, Caiaphas... Cleopas, rather, and his friend. Now we're in the resurrection, the morning after the resurrection, the first resurrection; what a beautiful morning, Jesus is up from the dead and living among His people. What a beautiful thought!\n\nL-239 He's here the same today as He was that day, because He's the same yesterday, today, and for... And revealing Hisself more today than He has in any other age since that day; come through the wheat and stalk and shuck (is all past now), we're into the wheat again. See, we're back into the grain.\n\nL-240 Known as... know... Watch how He made Hisself known to these people, now, remember, as their Messiah (just before we close) of the promised Word of the age. Notice! He appeared unto, to the... as He has said He'd do, to the prophets. Notice, \"Fools, and slow of heart to believe that all the prophets has wrote of Him had to be fulfilled.\"\n\nL-241 Watch Him! He refers right back to the Word of God, He never come right out and told them, \"Don't you know Me? I am the Messiah that's resurrected.\" He never said that. See, He just give them the Scripture; like John did, and the rest of them. See? He just... They have to pick that out themselves. They have to judge for theirselves. Now, don't go to sleep, judge for yourself.\n\nL-242 \"Fools, slow of heart to believe all that the prophets has said had to come to pass.\" What a rebuke to them that claimed they knew Him. See? [Luke 24:25]\n\nL-243 Notice how He approached the subject. He never come right out, as I said a few minutes ago, and said, \"Well, don't you know I'm your Messiah for this age? Don't you know that I'm He?\" The real servant of God never identifies himself that way; the Scripture identifies who he is. Sure, he will. But called their attention to what the prophets had said to look for in the Messiah's age. See it? Go right back: \"Fools, and slow of heart, not to believe that all the prophets said about the Messiah should come to pass.\" [Luke 24:25]\n\nL-244 He, as John, let the Word of the Bible identify Him, what He was to them. That should been made plain enough. If the Word had identified Him, that should be plain, who the promise was they was looking at. They knowed he had... someone had to come on the scene at that time.\n\nL-245 Why, He say, \"Now let Me show what the Word says is supposed to happen in this day.\"\n\nL-246 Am not I, tonight, trying to tell you, Word by Word (even to the position, the place, the names, numbers, everything else, and all the signs, times, and everything), that we're right here at the end time? Surely you can see what 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min I'm talking about. See? Look! That's so plain it should need no more identification. He said, when He was here on earth, \"Search the Scriptures, in them you think you have Eternal Life, they are what... they testify what I am, see, who I am.\" [John 5:39]\n\nL-247 Notice, He begin with Moses the prophet, a prophet, Deuteronomy 18:15. I'm watching the Scriptures here. Deuteronomy 18:15, Moses said, \"The Lord your God...\"\n\nL-248 See, God spoke to him on top of the mountain. And, oh, my, the thundering; they said, \"Let--let the Lord... Let Moses speak, not God, lest we perish.\" [Exodus 20:19]\n\nL-249 He said, \"They said well. I'll... I won't speak to them no more like this, but I'll raise them up a prophet.\" And that's been His message all the way through. That's what's got to settle the whole thing at the end. It's just got to, because the Word of the Lord has to come to the prophet. It's the only thing It can come to. If it don't, it breaks God's Word and makes Him tell something wrong. See? It'll never go to a seminary. It goes to a prophet. And the prophet is sent from God, ordained. And how you know it is, and not what the man said,... [Amos 3:7]\n\nL-250 We've had Elijahs, and coats, and everything else, and mantels, and all kinds of nonsense that went off into organizationism with everything else.\n\nL-251 But there will come on this earth, by God's promise, a genuine servant of God, identified by God (by His Word being the answer of this day), that'll set the Bride in order (a real little minority of the church) and take it up. That's right! He'll introduce, \"Behold, there's the One I talked about, see, that'll come.\" [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-252 And all that the prophets had said about Him, and for this age, why it sure would be interesting to have heard Him say that. Wouldn't you like to have heard Him say it? \"All the prophets said about...\" Remember, He said what the prophets would say about Himself, quoting His Own Self, what He had said (and He was the Word); quoting. [Luke 24:25-27]\n\nL-253 Now let's listen to the Words that He quoted. Would you like to hear what He said to them? Let's just carry their conversation now, just before we stop.\n\nL-254 Now, they were briefed on all the late happenings of the crucifixion, of the story at the grave and the tomb, and the women had seen Him, and another one said they seen Him, and so forth. He said... They--they briefed Him on that. And He goes right on with the Word about... quoting Himself through the Word: [Luke 24:25-27] \"Now look in Zechariah 12.\" (He must have quoted Zechariah 11:12.) \"For He was sold with thirty pieces of silver. Was not the Messiah supposed to be sold by thirty pieces of silver? [Zechariah 11:12] \"In Psalms 41:9, He was betrayed by His friends. See? [Psalms 41:9] \"Zechariah 13:7, forsaken by His disciples. [Zechariah 13:7] \"In Psalms 35:11, accused by false witnesses. [Psalms 35:11] \"By Isaiah 35:7, dumb before His accusers, never opened His mouth.\" (all right, sir) [Psalms 35:7] \"Isaiah 50:6, He was scourged. [Psalms 50:6] \"Psalms 22--22, He cried at the cross, 'My God, why has Thou forsaken Me?' All My bones they stare at Me. They pierced My hands and My feet.\" (Look at the prophecies He could talk about!) [Psalms 22:16-17] \"Isaiah 9:6, Unto us a child is born, a virgin shall conceive, so forth. [Isaiah 9:6] \"And also in Psalms 22:18, they--they--they parted His garments among them. \"In Isaiah 7:14, a virgin shall conceive. \"Psalms 22:7 and 8, made Him a... mocked by His enemies, His... supposed to be His friends; His enemies, the church. [Psalms 22:7-8] \"In Psalms 22 again, He was... not a bone was to be broken, but they pierced His hands and His feet. [Psalms 22:16] \"Isaiah 53:12, died with malefactors. [Isaiah 52:12] \"In Isaiah 53:9, bruised, and buried with the rich brother. [Isaiah 53:9] \"In Psalms 16:10, He was resurrected from the dead. David said so, 'I will not suffer My Holy One to see corruption, neither will I leave His soul in hell.' He was raised from the dead. [Psalms 16:10] 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min \"Malachi 3, John the Baptist was His forerunner.\" [Malachi 3:1]\n\nL-255 And all of the types He might have went to! Even to Isaac being the type of Him upon Mount... upon the mountain where his father Abraham took him, in Genesis 22. [Genesis 22:2-3]\n\nL-256 It was now that they begin to see who had fulfilled these Scriptures that was promised of that day. It was then, after it was late, they begin to see. \"Oh! Well, wait a minute! You know what?\" They knew then that their crucified Friend, Jesus, was that Prophet that was promised. They knew because... See, they hadn't been briefed on the Scriptures. [Luke 24:25-27]\n\nL-257 \"But, here, all these things that's supposed to happen at the cross, all these things. Fools, slow of heart to understand all the prophets have said; how that the Messiah shall suffer, and enter in His glory, and raise the third day.\" Still they don't.\n\nL-258 \"Oh, yes. That's right. I see. He--He--He... Did not our hearts burn within us?\" they said. No wonder their hearts burned! The prophecies that He was giving that was fulfilled. [Luke 24:32]\n\nL-259 Then they begin to understand that their friend, the man that they eat with, talked with, associated with, fished with, laid in the woods, that that fulfilled every Word of the promised hour! There it was. They had walked six miles, it seemed a very short time, I suppose, and they had heard a six-hour sermon on vindicated prophecy (a little longer than what we've had tonight, see). It was now getting kind of late in the evening time, the evening Lights had come.\n\nL-260 It's the same time now, church! The evening Lights has come! Hebrews 13:8, \"He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" Oh, events made clear by prophecy, same today. The evening Light promised by the prophet of God, in Zechariah 14:7, may again open the true believer's eyes to the events that's taking place today, that's proved by the prophecies that we're at the end time. Jesus is coming. [Hebrews 13:8], [Zechariah 14:17]\n\nL-261 The very... It's...\n\nL-262 He said, \"There will be a day that it won't be called night or day.\" He said, \"But in the evening it shall be Light.\" Now, we know, geographically, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Now, the prophet said, \"There'll be a long stretch of time that'll be dismal, kind of a... couldn't be called day or night; it's kind of a dark, gloomy day.\" [Zechariah 14:6-7]\n\nL-263 Now, where did the Son rise? What... That was S-o-n we're talking about now. That the natural s-o-n rises in the east and sets in the west. The very same God, very same Son, rather. And the S-o-n of God rose first in the east, to the eastern people.\n\nL-264 And now after He left, what did they do? Three hundred years later, they started their first organization, the Roman Catholic church. Through the Dark Age they went, and out they come. What'd they do? The same thing. It's been a day of... It hasn't been called day or night. They had enough orders, and they believed that He was the Son of God, and walked in the light what they had, they made their churches, they built hospitals and schools and so forth, and seminaries, sent their children to school.\n\nL-265 But the prophet said, \"It shall be Light again about the evening time. The Son will peep out again, it shall be Light.\" What? The same Son (S-o-n) that was revealed in flesh at the morning time, back there, will be revealed again in the evening time. [Zechariah 14:7]\n\nL-266 Now compare St. Luke 17:30, \"And in that day, as it was in the days of Sodom, the setting of the world, in the time that the Son of man is being revealed.\" [Luke 17:30] It shall be Light about the evening time, The way to Glory you will surely find.\n\nL-267 Oh, my! People, where are we at? Nations are breaking, Israel's awaking, The signs that the prophets foretold; The Gentile days numbered, with harrows encumbered; (Watch her slide into the sea!) Return, O dispersed, to your own. 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min The day of redemption is near, Man's hearts are failing for fear; Be filled with the Spirit, have your lamps trimmed and clear, Look up! your redemption is near. (You better.)\n\nL-268 Brother, sister, it's a scary time. Watch the things that's prophesied, watch the things happen. Watch all the prophecy being fulfilled, then we see what all this is about. It's not a bunch... a streak of fanaticism. It's God confirming His Words exactly, exactly. The Rock is smitten, friends, flee to It as quick as you can. Prophecy is vindicating the day that we are living in.\n\nL-269 Let us bow our heads. [A brother speaks in another tongue. A sister gives an interpretation. A brother on the platform says, \"Can we hold steady for just a moment? God has spoken to us through Brother Branham, and the anointing is on Brother Branham, and he's not through. And...\" Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]\n\nL-270 Dear God! Are you realizing the day that we live in, friends? Would you dare dispute God? Would you say that \"He's not right,\" when He's proved It? He's His Own interpreter. Do you want to serve Him? Now with your heads bowed, and your hearts bowed, brother, sister.\n\nL-271 This may be our last meeting time. We may never... If I would be back a year from today, if I live, there'd be many that's here now won't be here then. And I'll have to meet you at the Judgment Bar and answer for everything that I said tonight.\n\nL-272 Before God, while you're in your right mind, would you now do this much to God? If you know that you're... Just look at yourself in the looking glass of God (the Bible), no matter who you are, and say, \"I know I'm way short from being a daughter of God, look the way I do. I'm way short from being a son of God, look the way I do. But, God, I don't want to be here, I--I want to strive to that place.\" I want you to raise your hand to God, just ever who you are, wherever you are across the building, \"Yes, I want to be a son of God. I want to be a daughter of God. I want to fulfill everything that my Lord has commanded.\" Now you... God bless you. I guess ninety percent of the audience.\n\nL-273 Now looky here, my friend. What if you would have lived in the days when you heard John preach? What if you would have lived in the days when Jesus was here? Whose side would you have took? If you'd a-lived in Jesus'... Remember, if He... If you'd lived back there, it would be just like it is now. The same Jesus is making Himself known by His Word, see, and It's very unpopular.\n\nL-274 But let me tell you, I'm not trying to tell people to leave church or... My, I want you to go to church, \"Don't forsake to assemble yourself together.\" But what I'm trying to tell you to do is press into the Kingdom of God. Get these things, the world, church... [Hebrews 10:25]\n\nL-275 Pentecostals, you people are getting too worldly. You're getting too much after the world. It's just easy, you keep watching televisions and all these things, and the way they're doing, and all this, and the first thing you know... The seminaries, the schools are beginning to compromise here and there, and this, that, and the other, and the first thing you know... It's got to come that way. The Pentecostal church, it's been my greatest support, I can't say nothing against it. But that's what I cry out, \"My brethren, get out!\" Call... You don't have the meetings that you used to have. The people are not like they used to be. But Jesus Christ is the same, let's move into Him.\n\nL-276 Now, you with your hands up, remember, there was a Rock smitten in the wilderness, and that fountain is still open tonight. Their Rock had been smitten, Christ, He is that smitten Rock. [I Corinthians 10:4]\n\nL-277 And tonight, so far as I know, the church may be... The time of calling may be already past, I don't know, I can't say that. Remember, the people went right on having the meetings, just the same, after the crucifixion of Jesus. And the... and all the people, they--they'll come, they... Watch! They--they'll go right on preaching, and saying they're \"getting saved\" and everything, just as if... \"The world continues on as it was,\" they say. But it'll be too late then.\n\nL-278 While you got a chance, my brother; while you got a chance, my sister; come into the Kingdom of God. You don't have to come in under anything else but just plain faith to believe His Word. He is that Word! \"Lord Jesus, I know I'm looking at myself now in the mirror of God's Word; oh, how short I am. But, dear God, here tonight, on this 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min Monday night, here in San Bernardino, California, in this auditorium here, this is--this is all I have, Lord, but I'll give it to You. Will You take me as I am, Lord? Will You let me flee to the cross right quick? I even see the messengers. I see the time, I see the calling out of Sodom. I see the signs. I see the Abraham's group receiving the Light. I see the manifestation, Jesus being manifested again right among us like it was. I see all the things that You promised. I see the impersonators; I see You said that, 'As it was in the days of Moses,' how this Jambres and Jannes would come back to impersonate, and still remain right in that same dump that they were in.\" [James 1:21-25]\n\nL-279 See, they couldn't follow Moses through that Word and take those children out of there into the wilderness, because they was associated in Egypt. They couldn't do it, though they done the same works he did. But their folly was made manifest. And the Bible says, That's THUS SAITH THE LORD, \"It will take place again in the last day.\"\n\nL-280 And you see it with your own eyes, if you're spiritual. I'm... I can't explain It. It's not necessary for me to explain It. \"My sheep hear My Voice.\" Let's go to Him now, while we have a chance. Will you? [John 10:16, 27]\n\nL-281 If you have need of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, if you have need of a rededication, a new life; your pastor won't despise you, he'll love you for it. Just give yourself completely to God tonight, while we're here. Let... Yes, I know it's been hard, cutting, strange, I don't do that to be mean, I do that to be honest. I do that because I love you, I love God, and I do it to try to help you. And truly, friend, I--I--I believe... And with all my heart, with all my faith, I believe that my Message comes from God. It's--It's been proving that to you through the years.\n\nL-282 Now listen, tonight surrender everything you got, everything that you have need of. I believe, with a true, surrendered heart, if you will just stand upon your feet, and raise up your hands to God, and say, \"Dear God, here I am. Take me, Lord. No more will I try to use my own mind and my own interpretation. Your Word says I must be 'holy, I must be borned again, I must be filled with the Spirit, and then the Spirit will lead me into all the Truth.' Dear God, here I am, lead me.\" Would you do that much? If you do that much, raise your hand, say, \"I'm willing to do that, I'm willing to.\"\n\nL-283 Then let's all stand up on our feet. Just as I am, without one plea, But that Thy Blood was shed for me, And that Thou bids me come to Thee, O Lamb of God, (God's only door)... come! I... Now get all of your work, everything else, your tiredness, everything... What if you were dying now? Just as I am, Thou will receive, Will welcome, pardon, cleanse, receive; Because I... Will you put your hand up, on this verse now? I promise, I will believe, O Lamb of God, I come! I come!\n\nL-284 Now while the organist continue--continues to play, let's each one of us...\n\nL-285 Young teen-agers, do you want to get like this out here on the street, this bunch of hoodlums?\n\nL-286 Sister, do you want to wear short hair, when it's your Nazarite honor to God to have long hair? \"It's a shame for her to cut her hair.\" Would you wear these little ol' skirts and things that they wear today, this--this immoral dress, with your body showing through it, out there on the street? Did you know every man that looks upon you commits adultery with you in his heart? And you present yourself like that. Do you know, women, you that wear makeup, there's only one woman in the Bible that ever wore makeup? And God fed her to the dogs. A Jezebel, a name that's been hated since her day, because of her acts of that. You know it was Elijah the prophet who cursed that and called her out in that manner? Do you know it was Herodias that John the Baptist got after? Do you... You don't want to be that Hollywood thing of the world. \"If you love the world or the things of the world, the love of God is not in you.\" [I Corinthians 11:5]\n\nL-287 Brother, minister friend, nothing... Please understand me, I am your brother. Do you want to associate yourself, 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min and you church members of some church (Methodist, Baptist, or whatever you been), do you want to hold on in that denomination because your mother and your grandmother held on that? She come out of something to come into that, that was the Light of that day; that, like in the times of Noah. This is another day.\n\nL-288 You say, \"Well, I had the...\"\n\nL-289 This is not the day of Pentecost. The Pentecostal age is past. Pentecost is gone, this is harvest time. See? And the harvest time, the grain; the water's done been poured out, the grain's getting ripe. Come into the grain, my dear brother. Hear me, believe me, if you believe me to be a servant of God, let each one, in our own way, bow our head in humility and offer the prayer that we--that we know that we should offer, \"God, take me as I am.\"\n\nL-290 And brother, sister, I lay myself on the altar tonight, too: God, mold me and make me different. Do something, God, make me in Your fashion.\n\nL-291 You think it's easy to stand here and cut the people to pieces like that? It's a hard thing to do. But woe unto me if I don't do it.\n\nL-292 Dear God, as this audience bows their head and heart, in this solemn moments here of closing of this Bible lecture; when we see the a-vindication of the Holy Spirit that shook this nation back and forth, and back and forth, great revivals and indication, knowing that something has to follow that. And then see those seven Angels come down there on top of that mountain yonder in Arizona, when even the magazines across the nation's packed It. To see Jesus Himself there in the skies, looking down, and saying that, \"In the Revelation 10:7, in the seventh angel's Message, these seals would be opened, the mysteries of God would be made known.\" That the reformers didn't live long enough to--to bring it out. And here, these seven seals that sealed the whole thing is to be opened in this day. To see all these great signs and wonders that's been done, vindicated, foretold before it happened, and not one time have You ever failed us, but brought it to pass just as it was said. [Revelation 10:7]\n\nL-293 Dear God, we realize that Jesus Christ is in our midst. We know that He is here. He's here tonight, the invisible God is here with us, and can confirm every promise that He made in His Word. How You have stood and proved to them, with backs turned, in the original beginning before the impersonators even entered the ring, Lord, or entered into the--the--the race, as it was. You showed and proved, prophesied and told exactly the way it would happen, and we see it's happened that way. And Father, God, we know it cannot be man, it has to be God. So we know it's You here tonight. Forgive us of our sins. [Matthew 18:20]\n\nL-294 Dear God, You've healed our sickness, now for--forgive our sins, Lord, of not being the kind of Christian that we should be, not... Professing to be a full-Gospel man or woman, and here we find ourselves slumping off like a denominational chicken. Help us, dear God, take us and shake us with Your Holy Spirit. And if there be anything in us that's not like You, take it out of us, Lord. And plant our feet on God's Holy Word, and let the Holy Ghost burn down into our heart and take all the dross of unbelief and the drowsiness of this day; oh, arise and shake ourself. Grant it, God. Cleanse us! Mold us! Make us! God, grant it.\n\nL-295 If there's any in here tonight, Lord, that's holding in their heart that grain, that gene of God that's ordained to Life from the foundation of the world; I know, Lord, that they're bound to hear at this hour. So, I pray, God, that You'll fill their soul and illuminate them with a fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost, and send them on their road, rejoicing and happy. [John 15:16], [Ephesians 2:10]\n\nL-296 Lord God, they... I give them to You. I don't know who they are, You do. I'm only responsible for preaching Your Word, Lord, as You reveal It. You're responsible for the rest of it: where the Seed falls. I just throw It. Lord God, I pray that It fell in good, rich soil tonight. That many will see It, Lord, and rise to shining Christians in this last days, that the great thing that we're looking forward to come, will come quickly. Grant it, Lord. And You'll take Your Church, Your Bride, and take Her home. We see It all setting in order. Come, Lord Jesus. We commit it all to You, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for the results. Amen. [Romans 9:16] I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me 65-1206, Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy, Orange Bowl, San Bernardino, CA, 113 min And purchased my salvation On Calvary's...\n\nL-297 Do you love Him? Well, then you have to love one another. Shake one another's hand when you sing it again: I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On...\n\nL-298 Now let's give Him praise. How many knows this song: I will praise Him, I will praise Him, Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory all ye people, For His Blood has washed away each stain.\n\nL-299 Let's sing it now: I will praise Him, I will praise Him, Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory all ye people, For His Blood has washed away each stain.\n\nL-300 Don't you feel all scoured out? Raise your hand, you say, \"Oh, that makes me feel good.\" Brother, I love those old-time songs. Don't you? They go down to the heart. I will praise Him, I will praise Him, Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory all ye people, For His Blood has washed away each stain.\n\nL-301 Let's just raise our hands now and praise God, every one of us, in our own way:\n\nL-302 Lord Jesus, we thank You. We praise You, Lord. We give You praise for a called-out people, out of Babylon. We thank You for the Blood of Your Son, Jesus Christ. We thank You because He makes us clean this minute. We for-... We ask forgiveness of our wrongs, our stupidity, Lord, our stumbling in the dark. O God, may we rise and shine, and walk in the evening Light, and be the fruit of the Tree that's coming forth by the evening Lights. Grant it, dear God. We commit ourselves to You, in Jesus Christ's Name.\n\nL-303 Now with your heads bowed, I give you the pastors backing the service. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.

Greetings, Brother Salano and his wife, and all the delegates here at this banquet tonight. It's certainly a great privilege to be here. I've looked forward for this hour ever since we have started this way.\n\nL-2 And I--I want to thank that lady. I can't think of her name, Billy just told me they had give me a box of Christmas candy, and just brought it out to the car a few moments ago. The sister, I can't think of her name, she's from here in California. That was my first Christmas present. So I--I thank you for it.\n\nL-3 Now, tonight it's... Now in Tucson it's ten minutes after nine, but I think it's just ten minutes after eight here. So we... I have kind of a feeling amongst the people, I'm kind of long-winded in preaching, so I--I hope... [Congregation applauds--Ed.] Thank you. Such a... some nice persons in here. I thank you.\n\nL-4 But I'm--I'm just a little bit preached out, almost, tonight, I've been going so long from--from Shreveport and across the country (coming this way) night after night, and you get just a little--a little shook up, you know, and cold, and your throat gets hoarse. I started out at Shreveport. I lost my hair when I was... few years ago. And I had a little piece I put on when I'm preaching in the north country, to keep from taking a cold. I went to Shreveport and forgot it, and I really got a cold. Them wind coming across like that, you really just don't know. It was taken out accidentally, and the skin's still soft, and with just a little perspiration and I've really got it in the throat; had to close many meetings. So I'm just a teeny bit hoarse tonight.\n\nL-5 We want to say we've had a wonderful time coming across here, though, in the meetings. Last night we had a wonderful time up in... with the brethren up, the other chapter. And so had a great crowd out and wonderful attendance, the people so reverent and nice. So it makes me feel real good to be a part of the Full Gospel Business Men. It's been...\n\nL-6 I have a Message, I feel, from God. It's a little odd to some people. And I can't help being no more... I just got to be what I am. And we... I don't mean to be different, it's just that I--I'm living at a changing time. We're...\n\nL-7 As long as you're building the wall one straight way, it's all fine, the--the bricklayers can go right down the row. But when you have to turn the corner, that's where the time... And we're not building a wall; we're building a house, you see, so these turns has to come. They come in the age of Martin Luther, John Wesley, and the Pentecostal age; it's here again. So we... it's hard to turn the corners. But I'm so thankful for... to God, even though how rough it's been, the people has responded one hundred percent. So we're very grateful, thank each one of you. And now before we open the Book, let's speak to the Author, if you will, just a moment, while we bow our heads:\n\nL-8 Dear God, we are grateful to You tonight for the privilege of knowing Jesus Christ (our Saviour) Your Son and the free pardoning of our sins, and to know that His Blood is sufficient that's covered all of our sins and our iniquities. They're so blotted out and put in the sea of God's forgetfulness and His Bride will stand at the Wedding Supper, pure, unadulterated, to marry the Son of God. How we thank Thee for this all-sufficiency and the faith to know that we do not trust in our own merits but in His merit alone, for what He did for us. We're so grateful.\n\nL-9 Thank You for the--the success that these brethren had overseas and the countries over there where they're hungering and thirsting for God. I pray, Lord, that if they go back again, that those children that they brought into the Kingdom will be great-grandmothers and grandfathers of the children that they bring in also. Grant it, Father.\n\nL-10 Bless us together, tonight, and may the Holy Spirit give to us the things that we have need of. Close our mouths to the things that we should not say, and open our hearts to receive what You would tell us. Grant it, Father. In Jesus' Name we pray. Amen. [Philippians 4:19]\n\nL-11 Now let's turn in the Bible to a little text that I would like to speak on for a while tonight, and it's found over in St. Mark, the 10th chapter.\n\nL-12 And I had... A few years ago when I would speak, I would--I wouldn't even have to write a note, I could remember 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min it. And I didn't have to take a pair of glasses to read it out of the Bible. But since I've passed twenty-five now, twice, and so kind of little hard for me to--to do like I used to do. And it's like a worn-out car, but I'm still running. Uh-huh, I want to keep on chugging along till it's... I go to the scrap heap to be molded over again. That's the promise.\n\nL-13 St. Luke, the 10th chapter, and begin at the... I believe I said the 21st verse, if I can find it here somewhere. I'm mistaken, it's St. Mark. I'm sorry.\n\nL-14 St. Mark, the 10th chapter, and the--the twenty-... beginning with the 21st verse, I want to read. Let's get the 17th verse, rather: And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeling down to him, and asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou, me good? there is none good but one, and that is, God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth. Then said... Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, and sell whatsoever thou hast, and, give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasures in heaven: and come, and take up thy cross, and follow me. And he was sad at that saying, and he went away grieved: for he had great possessions. And may the Lord bless the reading of His Word. [Mark 10:17-22]\n\nL-15 Now, we're going to speak tonight on a subject. I want my text to be \"Follow Me,\" and my subject: Leadership.\n\nL-16 Now it's strange, but I thought maybe, today in praying... And I've been so long, and each night right down the line on the Message that I have, that the Lord has given to me to speak on. I thought tonight, over in this new chapter, I would approach it from a different standpoint. And many times we have talked on this, called it, \"The Rich Young Ruler.\" And--and many of the ministers here, my brethren, no doubt have approached it in many different ways. And I want to try to approach it in a--a different way tonight than I ever have, this of Leadership.\n\nL-17 This, remember this, that each one of us, young and old, your first step that you ever made in your life, someone had to lead you. That's right. And your last step you ever make, someone will be leading you. Someone has to lead.\n\nL-18 God has likened us unto sheep. And if anyone knows about raising sheep and the nature of sheep, why, you know that a sheep cannot find his way around. He has to be led. Even in the slaughter pens, we find that they bring the sheep there and he's led up into the slaughter by a goat. A goat leads him up, then when he gets up to the end of the chute he jumps out, and the sheep goes right on into the slaughter. So they... We find that a sheep cannot find his way around. [John 10:12-16]\n\nL-19 I remember an experience I had with one, one time. I was state game warden in Indiana, and I had been out in the field; and I heard something, the most pitiful cry. And it was a--a little lamb, had--had lost his mama. And he couldn't find his way to her, and the mother couldn't find her way to the--to the little lamb. I picked the little fellow up, and how quiet he laid against me. I went along there, my hands holding the little fellow. And crying, and--and I heard him. How he just snugg'ed his little head down against me and it seemed like he knew that I--I--I was going to help him.\n\nL-20 I thought, \"O Rock of Ages, cleft for me, pick me up in the arms of the Lord Jesus, just be content as I know I'm--I'm going to go Home to be with my loved ones.\" I thought, \"At the end of my life's journey, just bring me in Your arms, Lord, like that. That I know I'll be carried across the river then, there on the other side where there'll be no sorrows and sicknesses, and things, and I'll be with the loved ones that I've loved.\"\n\nL-21 And if you'll study nature, there's a great thing in nature. Everything that I--that I look at, and God has made, He's the Author of nature. Nature runs in continuity. All nature runs about the same. You notice, everything... As I have said, I believe last evening, that \"Nature testifies of God.\" If you never had a Bible, you could still watch nature and know that this Bible is the Truth.\n\nL-22 I--I had the privilege of being around and around the world. And I've read the different phases, and I've seen 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min different religions; the Mohammedans, and I've read the Koran, and--and seen the Sikhs, the Jains, and Mohammedans, and the Buddhists, and whatmore. But yet, each one of them, they have a philosophy and a--a--a--a book of creed and a book of laws, and so forth. But our Bible is the Truth, and our God is the only One that is right; 'cause each one of them has to point to a grave somewhere where their founder is still laying, but Christianity points to an open tomb and can live in the Presence of the One that was put in there. He is alive! It's not a God that was, It's a God that is. Not a \"I was\" or \"I will be,\" but \"I AM.\" [John 8:58]\n\nL-23 And all nature runs in continuity, as I have said, talking on our Church Ages (which we have the books now that's coming out). The... Why did I... about my writing of the Church Ages. And how that we see the Church, how It's matured, come up just exactly like all nature does.\n\nL-24 And we was talking the other day about how the sun rises in the morning, it's a little baby, real weak, not much strength to it at all. And as the day goes on, it gets stronger, stronger. About eight o'clock it enters school, like a young boy or young girl. And then about eleven o'clock it's out of school, and it's ready for its--its service. And then across till about three o'clock it changes, in the middle life into old age. And then dies in the afternoon. Is that the end of the sun? No. It comes back the next morning, to testify that there is a life, a death, a burial, a resurrection. See? See?\n\nL-25 We watch the trees, how they move and what they do. I was sometime ago down in Kentucky, I--I like to squirrel hunt, and I went down in the fall of the year there to squirrel hunt with a friend of mine. And it's... got very dry.\n\nL-26 And anyone ever hunted gray squirrel, know that how hard it is to slip up on them. When, the--the leaves, just crack one, and, oh, Houdini is an amateur escape artist to--to those fellows, how they can get away! And then trying to shoot eye shots at fifty yards, it takes some good hunting to get your limit in a day.\n\nL-27 So, Mr. Wood, a friend of mine, a--a converted Jehovah Witness, was with me. And we... He said, \"I know a farm over here where there's a man that's got a lot of...\" We call them there, \"hollars.\"\n\nL-28 How many know what a hollar is? Well, what part of Kentucky you from, anyhow? See? And that's where I am from.\n\nL-29 Like here in one of the chapters, not long ago; I have to tell this to Brother Williams and them, the brethren. They said, \"We will now stand and sing the national anthem--anthem.\" And I said, \"For my old Kentucky home.\" So nobody joined in with me, so... That was the only anthem I knew. And so we was--we was now...\n\nL-30 All right, sir. [Brother Branham is handed a note--Ed.]: \"Please have prayer, for a lady in here now is bleeding at the nose.\" Let us pray:\n\nL-31 Dear God, I ask You, Lord, Thou art the--the great Healer and I ask that Your grace and mercy will touch this dear woman just now and stop that blood. As a believing people who assembled together, the lady has come here to enjoy the Word of the Lord and the fellowship of the people, and I ask You, Lord, just now, to rebuke the enemy and stop the blood. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. (And we believe it...?...)\n\nL-32 On with the little story just to kind of get a feeling before we get right down in the few notes I've got written here, and some Scripture.\n\nL-33 Now he said, \"Well, this old man, we'll go over and see him. He's got a lot of hollars in his place,\" he said, \"but he's an infidel.\" He said, \"If... He just about curse us out if we went over there.\"\n\nL-34 I said, \"But we're not getting no squirrels here. We been camping two weeks. And we was dirty, and beard all out on face. And he said, \"Well?\" l said, \"Let's go over.\"\n\nL-35 So we went a few miles down, about twenty miles. I'd been in the country down there once before, for three nights, at a Methodist campground where there had been some great things the Lord had did, and great healing service 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min amongst the Methodist people. And then we went way back over some hills and hollars and ridges. And you just have to know Kentucky to know it, what kind of a place you had to get into. And while we went back there we come to a house, and there sat an old man, two old men, setting out there with their old hats slouched down over their face, and--and he said, \"There he is,\" he said, \"he's a tough one.\" Said, \"He hates that word of a 'preacher,'\" he said.\n\nL-36 So I said, \"Well, I just better set in the car, or we won't get to hunt at all.\" I said, \"You go in and ask him if we can hunt.\"\n\nL-37 So he got out and started walking in, he spoke to them. And in Kentucky, always, you know, it's \"come in,\" and so forth. And so he went up there and he said, \"I just wondered if we could hunt a while on your place.\"\n\nL-38 The old man setting there, about seventy-five years old, tobacco running down his mouth, he said... spit, and he said, \"What's your name?\" He said, \"My name is Wood.\" He said, \"Are you any relation to old man Jim that used to live...\" He said, \"Yeah, I'm Jim's boy.\" Said, \"I'm Banks. Yeah.\"\n\nL-39 \"Well,\" he said, \"old man Jim was an honest man.\" Said, \"Certainly, help yourself.\" He said--said, \"Are you by yourself?\" He said, \"No, my pastor is out there.\" He said, \"What?\" He said, \"My pastor is out in the car,\" said, \"he's hunting with me.\"\n\nL-40 He said, \"Wood, you don't mean you've got so low-down till you have to tote a preacher with you wherever you go?\" So he's a rough, old character, so I thought I'd better get out of the car, you know. So I got out and walked around, and he said, \"Well, and you're a preacher, huh?\" I said, \"Yes, sir.\" He looked me up and down; squirrel blood, and dirt. He said--he said... I said, \"Don't look much like it.\" He said, \"Well, I kind of like that.\" He said, \"You know, I want to tell you something.\" He said, \"I'm supposed to be an infidel!\" I said, \"Yes, sir, I understood that.\" I said, \"I don't think it's much to brag about, though. Do you?\"\n\nL-41 And he said, \"Well,\" he said, \"I don't know.\" He said, \"I'm going to tell you what I think of you guys.\" I said, \"All right.\" He said, \"You're barking up the wrong tree.\" And how many knows what that means? See? It means it's a lying dog, you see; the coon's not up there at all, see. He said, \"You're barking up the wrong tree.\" I said, \"That's to opinion.\"\n\nL-42 And he said, \"Well,\" he said, \"look, you see that old chimney standing up there?\" \"Yes.\" \"I was borned up there, seventy-five years ago.\" And said, \"I've lived right here in these hills all along through all these years.\" And said, \"I've looked towards the skies, I've looked here and there, and, surely, in all these seventy-five years, I would have seen something that looked like God. Didn't you think so?\"\n\nL-43 I said, \"Well, it depends on what you're looking at. See, what you're looking for.\" And he said, \"Well,\" he said, \"I--I certainly don't believe there is such a creature. And I believe you fellows just simply get out and swindle the people out of their money and everything. And that's the way it goes.\" I said, \"Well, you're an American citizen, you have a right to your own--own thinking.\"\n\nL-44 He said, \"There's one guy, one time, that I heard of,\" he said, \"that I would sure... If he... If I would ever get to talk with that fellow,\" said \"I'd like to--to ask him a few questions.\" I said, \"Yes, sir.\" He said, \"It was a preacher, you might know him.\" Said, \"He had a meeting up here in Campbellsville, not long ago, in 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min a church yard up there, a campground.\" And he said, \"I forget his name.\" Said, \"He's from Indiana.\" And--and I said, \"Oh? Yes, sir.\"\n\nL-45 And Brother Wood started to say, \"Well, I...\" (\"Don't say that.\") And so he said... I said, \"What about him?\"\n\nL-46 He said, \"Well,\" he said, \"old lady...\" (somebody) \"up there on the hill...\" Said, \"You know, she was dying with cancer.\" And said, \"Wife and I would go up there of a morning to--to change her bed.\" Said, \"They couldn't even raise her up high enough to put her on the bedpan,\" said, \"just had to pull a draw sheet.\" And said, \"She was dying. She had been to Louisville, and said the doctors had give her up and said she was 'going to die.'\n\nL-47 \"And her sister went up to that meeting, and said, 'That preacher was standing up there on the platform, looked back over the audience and called this woman by name, and told her, \"When she left, she took a handkerchief and put it in her--her purse.\" And called this woman's name down here, twenty miles below here, and said how she was suffering with cancer, what her name was, and all she'd been through; said, \"Take that handkerchief and go lay it on the woman,\" and said that \"the woman will be healed of her cancer.\"'\"\n\nL-48 And said, \"They come down here that night.\" Said, \"Honest, I heard the awfulest screaming up there. I thought they had the Salvation Army turned loose on top of the hill up there. Said, 'Well,' I said, 'I guess the old sister's dead.' Said, 'We'll... Tomorrow we'll go and get the wagon, and how we take her out to get to the main road,' and said, 'so they can take her to the undertaker.' And said that the... We waited. No need of going up that time of night.\" Said, \"It's about a mile up on the hill here.\" Said, \"We went up there the next morning, and you know what happened?\" I said, \"No, sir.\"\n\nL-49 He said, \"She was setting there eating fried apple pies, and drinking coffee, with her husband.\" I said, \"You mean that?\" He said, \"Yes, sir.\" \"Oh!\" I said. \"Now, mister, you really don't mean that.\"\n\nL-50 He said, \"What bothers me is what... how did that man, and never in this country, and knew that.\" See? And I said, \"Oh, you don't believe that.\" He said, \"It's the truth.\" I said, \"You believe that?\" See?\n\nL-51 He--he said, \"Well, go right up there on the hill, I can prove it to you.\" He's preaching back to me now, you see. So I--I said, \"Um-um.\" I picked up an apple, and--and I said, \"Can I have one of these apples?\" and I rubbed it on my clothes. He said, \"Well, the yellow jackets are eating them up, I guess you can have one.\" And then... And now I said, \"Well,...\" I--I bite... bit into it, and I said, \"That's a nice apple.\"\n\nL-52 He said, \"Oh, yes.\" Said, \"You know what? I planted that tree there, oh, forty years ago, or something like that.\" I said, \"Oh, is that right?\" \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nL-53 And I said, \"Well, and every year...\" I said, \"I notice we haven't had no frost yet, it's early August.\" And I said, \"Them leaves are falling off the trees.\" \"Yes, sir. That's right, it's coming on fall. Believe we'll have a early one this time.\"\n\nL-54 I said, \"Yes, sir.\" Changed the subject, see. And he said... I said, \"Well, you know, it's strange\" I said, \"how that sap goes out of that tree.\" I said, \"And them leaves falls off, and yet there's no... they--they haven't had no frost to kill the leaf.\" And he said, \"Well,\" he said, \"what's that got to do with what we're talking about?\" And I said, \"Well, I--I just wonder.\" (You know, mama always said, \"Give a cow enough rope and it'll hang itself, you know.\" So I just give him plenty of rope.) So he went on out, and he said, \"Well, yes, what's that got to do with it?\" 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min\n\nL-55 I said, \"You know, God brings them apples up, and you enjoy those apples and leaves, and you set in--in the shade and so forth. It goes down in the fall of the year and\" I said, \"comes back up again with the apples and with the leaves again.\" And he said, \"Oh, that's just nature. See, that's just nature.\" I said, \"Well, of course, that's nature.\" I said, \"That's nature, but Somebody has to control nature.\" See, I... he said... \"You tell me now what does that?\" And he said, \"Well, it's just--just naturally nature.\" I said, \"Who is it that says to that little leaf now, and the...?\" I said, \"Now, the reason that leaf falls off, it's because the sap goes down into the root. And what if that sap stayed up in the tree through the wintertime? What would happen?\" Said, \"It would kill the tree.\"\n\nL-56 \"Well,\" I said, \"now, what intelligence that runs that sap down into the roots, says, 'Get out of here now, it's coming fall of the year, get down into the roots and hide'? And stay down into the roots like a grave; and then next spring comes back up again, brings up more apples, and brings up more leaves and things.\" He said, \"That's just nature, it'll do it.\" Said, \"The weather! The changing, you know, coming on fall.\"\n\nL-57 I said, \"Set a bucket of water on the post out there, and see if nature runs it down the bottom of the post and brings it back up again. See?\" See? \"Well,\" he said, \"you might have something.\" I said, \"Think of it while we go hunting.\" And he said, \"Well,\" and he said, \"hunt where you want to.\"\n\nL-58 And I said, \"When I come back, if you'll tell me what intelligence runs that sap out of that tree down into the roots and stay all winter and come back the next winter, I'll tell you that's the same Intelligence that told me about that woman up there.\" Said, \"Told you?\" I said, \"Yes, sir.\" He said, \"You're not that preacher!\" I said, \"Would you know his name?\" Said, \"Yes.\" I said, \"Branham?\" He said, \"That's him.\" I said, \"That--that's right.\" See?\n\nL-59 And you know what? I led the old man to Christ, right there on his own testimony.\n\nL-60 And a year later I was down there and pulled a car (Indiana license on it) in the yard. They had moved away, he had died. And so when I come back, there stood his wife to really rake me over; I thought I had permission to hunt. And she come out there, she said, \"Can't you read?\"\n\nL-61 I said, \"Yes, ma'am.\" She said, \"Did you see those signs saying 'No Hunting!'?\" I said, \"Yes, ma'am, but\" I said, \"I--I have permission.\" \"You do not have permission!\" she said. And said, \"We got this place--place posted for many years.\" I said, \"Well, sister, I--I was wrong then, I'm sorry.\"\n\nL-62 And said, \"Sorry nothing! Them Indiana license on there, and set up here, you're the boldest people!\" I said, \"Could I just explain it?\" I said... She, \"Who give you permission?\"\n\nL-63 I said, \"I don't know just...\" I said, \"It was an elderly man setting out there on the porch, when I was down here last year, and we was talking about God.\" See? And she looked, she said, \"Are you Brother Branham?\" And I said, \"Yes, ma'am.\" 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min\n\nL-64 She said, \"Forgive me. I didn't know who you were.\" She said, \"I want to tell you his testimony. His last dying hours, he raised up his hands and praised God.\" Said, \"He died in Christian faith, and was carried away to God.\" See? \"If they hold their peace, the rocks will immediately cry out.\" There's something in nature. [Luke 19:40] Watch the birds, watch the animals, watch everything, and you watch nature.\n\nL-65 Watch the little dove how he flies. What a different bird he is, see. He--he doesn't have any gall, he can't eat like the crow can. See? He has no gall in him. He doesn't have to take a bath in the--in the--in the water, because he's got something on the inside of him; it cleans him from the inside out, you see.\n\nL-66 That's the way the Christian is. That's the way God represented Himself, in a--in a--in a dove. See, because... and the... Jesus was represented as a Lamb. Always in nature you'll find God. And God likened us unto sheep that has to be led. Did you ever notice there, I preached a sermon on it sometime ago? That the Dove coming down on the Lamb, to lead the Lamb, and It led Him to the slaughter. The--the--the Dove! Now, if that Lamb... That Dove could not have descended upon any other type of animal, because they both had to be of the same nature. See? If the Dove would've lit upon a wolf, and he would have snorted or growled, the Dove would have took Its flight. [Matthew 3:16], [Mark 1:10], [Luke 3:22], [John 1:29, 32-33], [Isaiah 53:7-8], [Acts 8:32]\n\nL-67 Well, that's the same way now. And our ill ways, the Holy Spirit just takes His flight and goes away. It's got to have the same nature. The bird of the Heavens, the dove; the meekest animal on earth, the lamb; they can agree together. And when the Holy Spirit comes upon us and makes us new creatures, then He can lead us. But we try to live the same old life, it won't work! It just won't work. [II Corinthians 5:17]\n\nL-68 Now, the first step you probably ever taken in your life, speaking of leadership, is probably the hands of some kind old mother. Them hands may be still tonight, out here in some cemetery somewhere, but that was the hand that held you to make your first step.\n\nL-69 Then after mother taught you how to walk, and you'd make a few steps then fall down, and get up, and you thought you were doing great things, then she turned you over to the school teacher. And then she begin to lead you to an education; of how and what you must do, and how you must learn, and--and so forth like that.\n\nL-70 Then after the school teacher got through with you, then you returned back, your father got a hold of you. Then when your father got a hold of you, he taught you perhaps your business; how to be a successful businessman, how to do things right. Your mother taught you how to be a--a housewife, how to cook, and so forth like that. Then after they got through with you, then your minister or priest got a hold of you.\n\nL-71 But now who leads you? That's the question now. Now, we're all led by something tonight. We have to be. We're led. Notice! [Romans 8:9, 14]\n\nL-72 Now let's look at this young fellow's... what had influenced him. Let's look at the... this young businessman we would call him, 'cause he was a businessman. He was a great successful man. Let's look at his leaders.\n\nL-73 Perhaps, first, his mother had taught him as a little boy the things that he should do. His father had made him such a fine success, and maybe left him an--left him an inheritance, because he was a ruler himself; perhaps his father was gone, so he was a--a businessman. He was a... Let's call him, today, like a Christian businessman; or, he was a religious businessman, I think would be the best quotation.\n\nL-74 This man was religious, he was by no means an infidel. And he had been taught by his mother how to do right, how to walk, how to dress himself. He had been taught by his father, a great business, and how to be a successful man; and his business was successful. And father and mother had been raised up in the church, and had pointed him to the priest. And the priest had made him a real religious man. Therefore he was a fine cultured man, he was a fine boy with good character.\n\nL-75 If Jesus Christ looked at him and loved him, there was something about the boy was real. Right. For the Bible said here, we find out in Mark, \"And Jesus beholding him, loved him.\" Yeah, \"Jesus beholding him, loved him.\" So therefore there must be something real outstanding about this young fellow. He was a... had a good character, and a 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min good character rating. He was a man that was raised right; intelligent, smart, intellectual, successful in business, and a religious man. He had a lot of good characteristics that was outstanding, so much that it attracted the attention of Jesus Christ the Saviour. But when he was confronted, being successful in all these other things... [Mark 10:21]\n\nL-76 Nothing had went wrong; he was perfectly cut out right, measured up right, intelligent, right education, his success, he was smart, a fine businessman, probably belonged to a businessman's group somewhere there in Palestine. He might have belonged to a businessman's fellowship like we have here tonight, no doubt he did, because businessman has always had fellowships with another, one with the other.\n\nL-77 Cause just like \"birds of a feather,\" they have things to talk about. And if this... The religious men, they don't want to talk about the man that runs the barroom and the... all of them together, 'cause they have nothing in common. We've got to have things in common. So Christians has things in common with Christians; sinners has things in common with--with sinners; and--and societies, and whatever they are, they have things in common. And this young boy probably belonged to a--a businessman's fellowship.\n\nL-78 And he was religious as he could be, because Jesus, in questioning here, he said, \"I have kept these commandments, observed them all from my youth.\" That's right. [Mark 10:20]\n\nL-79 See, he had been brought up right, taught right, and everything. But when he was confronted with the--the thought of Eternal Life... Now I want you to notice, with all this character that he had, he yet knew he did not possess Eternal Life.\n\nL-80 Now, all of our societies, our church, our membership and the things that we hold so dear, our American societies, and everything, is very fine, there's nothing to be said against that. And our Christian Business Men's society here, is a great thing, it's been a open door for me to... on my interdenominational thoughts that \"we are Christians.\"\n\nL-81 There is no one (no one denomination) can claim us, a real Christian, because you belong to God. Denominations are manmade, and Christianity is Heaven-sent. But in all these things that we have, as good as they are, as fine as we come together, and as nice of meetings as we have, and social understanding that we have, yet we're each one confronted with Eternal Life. And no matter how successful we've been in business, how successful we been, and what a great church member we are, and how we work, how we try to do things right, still, if it's not done in the right way, it is a worship of God in vain. [Matthew 15:9], [Mark 7:7]\n\nL-82 Jesus classed that the same way, as I stop here for a moment. He said, \"In vain do you worship Me, teaching for doctrine the commandments of man.\" Now think! A sincere, honest worship (with the sincerity of your heart) to God, and still be in vain! It began that way with Cain, at the Garden of Eden. Sincere worship, but was rejected! Very religious, still rejected! [Mark 7:7], [Genesis 4:5]\n\nL-83 In Shreveport last week, week before last, at a Business Men's meeting, a breakfast there where several hundreds of people had gathered, I took two and a half hours to speak on: Doing God A Service Without It Being God's Will. Now, that sounds strange, but we've got to channel ourselves into God's provided channel and God's way of doing it. No matter how much we think it's right, it's got to be according to the Word of the Lord or it's in vain. Cain worshipped, but it wasn't according to the Word of the Lord. The Pharisees worshipped, but not according to the Word of the Lord. And in this particular message to the Business Men, I taught this. [Genesis 4:3, 5]\n\nL-84 David, he wanted to do the Lord a service, and he was right in what he said. He said, \"Is it right for the ark of the Lord to be down there? Let's bring it up here.\" In the days of the king, the other king that he succeeded. He said, \"It's not right. They never consulted the Lord by the ark, but we must do it.\" Now, that's correct, what they should done. He said, \"We should go get the ark, and we can consult the Lord.\" And that's right, it was down in the other country. Said, \"We got to bring it up here. Get it up here and put it in our house here, and worship the Lord.\" [I Chronicles 13:3]\n\nL-85 Now notice he went in the wrong channel to do it. He consulted the captains of fifties and hundreds and thousands. They all was consulted, every one. Seeing it was the will of the Lord, looked like that it was the--the Word of the Lord. [I Chronicles 13:1]\n\nL-86 The Word of the Lord, sometimes, you have to put It in Its right place or it's not the Will of the Lord. See? Now let 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min that soak deep and you'll get a--a general conception of what I'm trying to say.\n\nL-87 I don't want the church to fall into the steps that you found over there in England: long hair, and painted-face men, and pervert. We don't want that! No matter how religious it sounds, and how much Elvis Presley can sing religious songs, he's still a devil. And I'm no judge, but \"By their fruits you know them.\" See? He's a Pentecostal, but that don't make a bit of difference. See, your fruits bear record of what you are. [Matthew 7:16, 20]\n\nL-88 No matter if the Spirit comes upon him, he could speak in tongues, he could shout, he could heal the sick, and Jesus said, \"Many of them will come to Me in that day, and say, 'Lord, haven't I done this and that?' And I'll say, 'Depart from Me, you that work iniquity, I never even knew you.'\" See? [Matthew 7:21-23]\n\nL-89 We've got to be real, genuine Christians, and the only way we can do that is confront it with this question here of \"Eternal Life.\"\n\nL-90 There's only one form of Eternal Life, and that comes from God. And He foreordained every creature that would ever have It. Just as you were the gene in your father, you was a gene in God; one of His attributes to begin with, or you'll never be There. You come forth in the bedding ground of your mother; your father didn't know you, you were in his loins. And when you come forth in the bedding ground of the mother, then you become a human being and are made in the image of your father, now you can fellowship with him. And the same thing by God, if you got Eternal Life. [John 3:15], [John 5:11, 20], [John 6:54, 68], [John 10:28], [John 17:2-3]\n\nL-91 The life that you come in, the natural life, physical life, that was by your father. And the only way you can come born again, is the only way, is it has to be from your Heavenly Father, His attributes. \"All the Father has given Me will come to Me.\" See? [John 6:39]\n\nL-92 You are here because your name was placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before there was even a foundation of the world. That's exactly right. You're a gene, a spiritual gene out of your Heavenly Father, a part of God's Word. That be so, as I've said, then you was with Jesus when He was here because He was the Word: you suffered with Him, died with Him, buried with Him, and rose with Him, and now setting in Heavenly places in Him! [Ephesians 2:6], [Ephesians 1:4]\n\nL-93 Notice, David thought everything was fine, and he consulted all these people, and they every one begin to dance and shout and scream. They had all their religious motions that there was, but still it wasn't God's will to go down and bring the Word of God back to the house of God. But, you see, God always (in all ages) works through one way. His first decision is His only decision, because He's perfect in His decisions. He never does nothing except He first reveals it to His servants, the prophets. That's exactly. [Amos 3:7], [I Chronicles 13:1]\n\nL-94 That's why this, the church age that we live in. There's no church, no Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostals, or anything else, can ever put this Church into the Bride. It'll have to be the answering of Malachi 4, for God to send a prophet to be revealed to, 'cause that's the only way. Our churches denominate and throw the thing into a mess and huddle, just like they've always been, and God always sends the prophets. [Malachi 4:5-6]\n\nL-95 And there was Nathan standing in the land, a vindicated prophet before God, and he wasn't even consulted. [I Chronicles 13:1]\n\nL-96 And they went down there and caused the life of a honest man, and so forth, and took the ark. Instead of putting it on the shoulders of the Levites, to pack it, they put it on a cart to pack it. Altogether messed up! [II Samuel 6:3-4], [I Chronicles 15:15]\n\nL-97 You see, if you don't go according to the--the will of God, and the way that God has give us to go, they always get It messed up and take It off in some organization, denomination, some message, and there you go. See? It's always been done that way.\n\nL-98 That's the same thing that this boy was confronted with. He come in; he had been a--a--a member of maybe the Pharisees or Sadducees, or some great order of that day. He was religious as he could be. He said, \"I've observed these commandments I've been taught, since I was a youth.\" See? And Jesus loved him for it. But he refused to be guided, he refused to accept the real leadership of Jesus Christ to give him Eternal Life. [Mark 10:20] 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min\n\nL-99 Notice, he believed there was something different than what he had, or he would have never said, \"Good Master, what must I do now?\" [Mark 10:17]\n\nL-100 See, he wanted to do something himself. That's the way we do, we want to do something ourself. The Gift of God is a free gift. God give It to you, you don't do one thing for It. He ordained It to you, and you're going to have It. See?\n\nL-101 Notice, he knew It was there. He believed in It and wanted It. But when he was confronted with how he had to do it, it was different from his ritual. It was different. He could hold his money and belong on to the church that he belonged to, and so forth. But Jesus knew that, and knew that he had hoarded this money, and He said, \"Go sell all you got, and give it to the poor. And come, take up your cross and follow Me, and you'll have treasures in Heaven.\" But he couldn't do it. [Luke 18:22]\n\nL-102 The other leaders that he had in his youthful days, had such an influence on him till he refused to accept God's provided Way, which was Jesus Christ; the only One who holds Eternal Life, the only One that can give you It. Not the church can give you Eternal Life; not your neighbor; not your pastor; not your priest; not your creed; only Jesus Christ Himself can give you Eternal Life. He's the... [II Peter 2:5]\n\nL-103 No matter how good you are, what you quit doing, what you start doing, you've got to accept the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. And then when you do that, He is the Word, and then your life fits right in the Word and it manifests itself to this age that you're living in. [John 12:44-46], [John 7:37-39]\n\nL-104 Noah had to do that for the Word to be manifested in his age. Now, what if Moses come along, said, \"We know what Noah done, we'll take Noah's word. We'll do it just the way Noah did it. We'll build a--a ark and float down the Nile River, and go out of Egypt\"? Why, it wouldn't a-worked. See, that was another age. [Hebrews 11:7], [II Peter 2:5]\n\nL-105 Jesus couldn't have come with Moses' message; Luther couldn't come with the Catholic message; Wesley couldn't come with the Luther's message; the Pentecost couldn't come with the Wesley age message. And the Bride can't be formed in the Pentecostal denomination, it just can't do it. And that's exactly right. She's done organized and went out here, and there she sets, just like the rest of them. It's a shuck. Just like the life comes up through the... See?\n\nL-106 That writer, as I spoke the other night, that writer that wrote this book... And not 'cause he criticized me so bad, said I was \"A devil, if there was such a thing.\" So he said he didn't believe in God. He said, \"A God that could fold His arms and set up and watch them martyrs, through the early ages, and claim to have power to open the Red Sea, and let them women and children be tore to pieces by lions and so forth, and then said He was a loving God.\" Said, \"There's no such a creature.\" See, the fellow, without inspiration of the Word, fails to see It.\n\nL-107 The first corn of wheat, the Bridegroom, had to fall into the earth in order to rise again. So did the first Bride that was born at Pentecost had to go through that Dark Ages like any other seed, be buried. They had to die. They must do it. But it started sprouting again in Luther, in the first reformation. It didn't look like the seed that went in, but it was the Light of that day. The...?... stalk then went on into the tassel, Wesley. And from the tassel it went into Pentecost, the shuck.\n\nL-108 When you see into the wheat, when it comes forth, the corn of wheat, a man that's raised wheat, you go out and see that wheat form in there, it looks just exactly like the grain. But if you'll take a tweezer and set down and take that wheat and open it up, there's no grain in there at all. It's just a shuck. And then what? It's--it's formed there, to hold the grain. See? And then, the first thing you know, the life left the--the--the stalk to go into the tassel; left the tassel go into the shuck; it leaves the shuck and goes into the wheat. Three stages, see, of it. And then forms the Wheat outside of the three stages (Luther, Wesley, Pentecost). Just exactly. See, no doubt. You can't interrupt nature.\n\nL-109 Now look, every three years after a message has went forth sent from God, they organize. This has been twenty years, and there's no organization. It won't. See? Now the shuck has to pull away, give the Wheat a chance to lay before the Son, to ripen; the Message coming right back into the Church again, forming the Body of Jesus Christ just like the first original One that went into the ground. Now, to see the--the Eternal Life.\n\nL-110 The Life, sure the--the stalk back here carried the Life. Certainly, it did. But, you see, when it become the stalk 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min and it was finished, the organization, the Life went right on into Wesley; come right out, went in. And once, each one of them. One, a big blade, don't look like the grain. But when the little pollen comes, like the... on the--the shuck... or on the stalk, the pollen of the tassel, it looks a whole lot like the grain. But when it comes down to that shuck, it's almost there.\n\nL-111 Didn't Jesus say, \"In the last days\" (Matthew 24:24) \"the two would be so close it would deceive the very genes, predestinated, the Elected Ones, if it was possible\"? Almost like the real thing, see. So, in the last days. Now, you see, it's wheat time now. It's getting harvest time. This is not Luther's age, this is not Pentecost age, this is the Bride age. [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-112 As Moses called a nation out of a nation, Christ today is calling a Church out of a church, you see; the same thing in type, taking them to the glorious Eternal Promised Land.\n\nL-113 Now, to refuse that Person that's doing the calling, Christ, no matter if you're Pentecostal, Methodist, Luther, whatever you are, you got to... This age! Nothing against them, not at all, but in this age now you've got to accept (like they did in that age) the Person of Christ which is the Word! In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,... ... the same yesterday,... today, and for ever. Hebrews 13:8. See, you must accept that Person of Eternal Life! [Hebrews 13:8], [John 1:1, 14]\n\nL-114 Now, what Life Luther had, was justification. Wesley had sanctification, added to it. The Pentecost had the restoration of the gifts coming back in it, added to it. But now it's completing in the body, you see, the three phases of it, and out of that... Now, when the resurrection comes, the Life that lived in them Lutherans, that's went out, the Life that lived in the Methodists and went out, the Life that went into Pentecostals, will all be raptured out of the ground in the Body of the Bride to be taken in before Jesus Christ. Glory to God! Oh, it's exciting! It's the Truth!\n\nL-115 We've turned a corner! We're looking towards Heaven, watching for the coming; the Cap on the Pyramid, as we would say, His coming back! The Church must be resurrected soon, and we must get ready.\n\nL-116 And the only way you can, is not say, \"Well, I belong to the Assemblies. I belong to the Oneness, Twoness,\" or whatever it is, all them there, \"I belong to the church of God,\" that don't mean a thing. \"Our fathers shouted and danced,\" that's just perfectly all right, that was their day. But today you're confronted not with the organization that they made, but with the Life that's going on, which is Jesus Christ.\n\nL-117 This young fellow had done the same thing. Moses wrote those commandments. But, you see, the same God that wrote the commandment by His prophet, was the same thing that prophesied the day would come, \"I'll raise up a Prophet likened unto me. And it'll come to pass that all that don't hear Him will be cut off;\" back in the denominational shucks and tassels. They must go on to Life. And today, don't say, \"I'm Pentecost. I belong to this, I belong to that.\" That don't mean nothing. You've got to accept the Person Christ, Eternal Life. Confronts every one of us! Don't forget that. [Deuteronomy 18:18-19]\n\nL-118 The other leaders, you see, they had such a hold on him. Their peoples is taught, \"Well, we belong to this, and we belong to that,\" and had such a hold on him. But what a fatal thing, to reject the leadership of Eternal Life!\n\nL-119 Now, that Life is present tonight. That's right. The Holy Spirit is here, which is Christ in Spirit form; His Spirit, the anointing is here. ... a little while, and the world seeth me no more; yet ye will see me:... ... For I'll be with you, even in you, to the consummation, to the end of the world. [John 14:19], [Matthew 28:20]\n\nL-120 Jesus alone can lead you to that Eternal Life. There's no church, no denomination, no preacher, no priest, no nothing else can lead you to It, you must be led by Him, the only One that can lead you.\n\nL-121 Could you imagine Him leading you out of His Word, which that's Him? And if He is the Word, and you're a part 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min of Him, won't you be a part of the Word? The Word that God wants to pour the waters of salvation upon today, to identify Him today; like the apostles identified Him, like Luther, like Wesley, like in the people in them days identified Him. This is another age. It's the Word! The Word said these things that we're seeing taking place now, is predicted to take place in this hour. So accept Jesus Christ and let Him lead you to Eternal Life. [John 16:13]\n\nL-122 Though he had achieved, this young fellow... He had achieved all good things. In school, been fine. As a good boy, no doubt, he had been good. As a real father... In listening to his daddy in business, he had been a good--a good boy. Good to his parents. He had been loyal to his priest. He had been loyal to his church. He had been loyal to the commandments of God. But he lost the greatest thing, and the rest of them didn't mean very much to him when he turned down the leadership of Eternal Life, Jesus Christ. [Matthew 19:20], [Mark 10:20], [Luke 18:21]\n\nL-123 Notice! This leadership confronts every one of us today, the same thing as it did that young man, we... no matter how religious we are. You may be Catholic, you may be Baptist, Methodist, or you may be Pentecostals, or whatever you are, this same thing confronts you tonight: Eternal Life, that's, acceptance of Jesus Christ. We are given this opportunity. [Hebrews 3:7-8, 15]\n\nL-124 Sometime in life we have to confront the thing just like this young man did, because you are a mortal being and you are given the--you are given the opportunity of choice. You have a choice. God made it so you can choose. If He put Adam and Eve on free moral agency so they could choose, and then they made the wrong choice, and, see, He can do no more to you than He did to them. He's got to put you the same thing so you can choose or reject. You have a choice. Let's look at some of them:\n\nL-125 You have a choice, as a young man, whether you're going to have an education or not. You have that choice. You can want to be \"just not have it,\" you can just refuse it.\n\nL-126 You have a choice of your conduct. I'm going to hurt just a little bit here. See? You can go out and let your hair grow down and be a beatle or some of these ignoramuses.\n\nL-127 Or you women, you can look like a--a decent human being or you can be one of these weird creatures that we have out there, them blued eyes. And water-head haircuts and things, they're completely against the Word of God, which is absolutely contrary; not even offer... couldn't offer a prayer to be accepted. That's the Truth. Exactly right. That's what the Bible said. [I Corinthians 11:5, 13, 15]\n\nL-128 But what's happened to you, church? You've seen so much television, so much things of the world, it's so easy for your old Adam nature to drift into that, to act like the rest of them.\n\nL-129 May I repeat this again! In the kosher, in the offering of the--the--the atonement in the days of Moses, when Moses brought the children out, there was to be seven days that there was to be no leaven among the people. Anyone knows that. In Exodus, \"No leaven shall be found in your camp at all, seven days.\" That seven days represented the full \"seven church ages.\" See? [Exodus 12:15]\n\nL-130 \"No leaven.\" Now, what is that? No creed, no world. Jesus said, \"If you love the world or the things of the world, the love of God's not even in you.\" See? And we're trying to mix that; you can't do it! You've got to come to one thing to believe: you're either going to believe God, you're going to believe your church, you're going to believe the world. You--you cannot mix it together. And you can't hold to them old things that the other church before you did. You've got to take the Message of the hour. [I John 2:15], [I Corinthians 5:6-8], [Galatians 5:9]\n\nL-131 He said, \"What was left over, don't let it stay till morning (to come into this other age), burn it with fire; be destroyed.\" That the age that you're living in, the Message of this age, It's got to be brought out of the Scriptures and vindicated and proved by God that it's God doing so. Then you either receive That or reject It. That's Eternal Life, leadership of the Holy Spirit, leading His Church. [Exodus 12:10]\n\nL-132 We could stay on that a long time, but let's move, just keep moving along.\n\nL-133 The choice of your conduct. You could... You can't mix it now. You're either for God or against God, and the outward expressions shows exactly what's on the inside. See? The cocklebur... Many of you think, \"I got the baptism of 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min the Holy Ghost, I'm going to Heaven.\" That don't mean one thing that you're going to Heaven. No, sir. You can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life, and still be lost and go to hell. The Bible says so. Uh-huh, that's exactly right. [Matthew 6:24], [Matthew 7:16-20]\n\nL-134 Look here, you are a outside person. You have five senses that contacts that outside body. God gave you five senses; not to contact Him, your earthly home: see, taste, feel, smell, and hear.\n\nL-135 Then you have a spirit on the inside of that, and it has five outlets: conscience, and love, and so forth. Five outlets that you contact the spirit world with that, but with your spirit.\n\nL-136 Your physical contacts the physical. Your spiritual contacts the spiritual. But inside of that you've got a soul, and that soul is that gene that come from God.\n\nL-137 And like a baby formed in its mother's womb. When the baby comes into the--to the mother's womb by the little germ, it crawls into the egg. It doesn't form one cell a human, the next a dog, and the next a cat, and the next a horse. It's all human cells because it's building off of an original human cell.\n\nL-138 And when a man has been borned again by the Word of God, predestinated to Eternal Life, called \"The Elected,\" it'll be Word of God on top of Word, Word on Word! Not a denominational creed and then a Word, and a creed; and it won't work. You can't have that leaven in It! Only one Eternal Life, Jesus Christ the Word: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,... [John 1:1, 14]\n\nL-139 Friends, you feed my children. You send me across the mission fields to the world, to bring the Message. I got to be sincere with you. What I'm looking at, maybe you don't see. That's what I'm here to try to tell you. It's not because I don't love people, it's because I do love people. Corrective. When I see the slipping of the church, going off, say, \"Well, we did this and we did that,\" and look around over the church and see the... It just won't work.\n\nL-140 Then look here in the Bible and see it's got to be that way at the end, that lukewarm Laodicean Church Age, putting Jesus out (the Word). He never called... He ain't going to call no church. He said, \"As many as I love, I rebuke. I chasten them.\" Taking the Word and pound It on, and telling, \"You're wrong in it!\" That's the reason I love you. \"If you'll open the door and let Me in, I'll come in and sup with you.\" Not a church, He's done put out of that. [Revelation 3:19-20]\n\nL-141 She's headed for the Ecumenical Council. That's where she's gone, right back into Rome where she come from. And that's exactly. I've got that wrote on paper from twenty-five years ago, or thirty-three years ago, and there it is. Not only that, it's wrote in the Bible, from a vision. She's gone back. There's no way of saving it, it's gone! It's going to be that way.\n\nL-142 God's calling individuals. \"I stand at the door and knock. If any man, any person...\" One individual out of a thousand, it might be one out of a million. [Revelation 3:20]\n\nL-143 As I said a few nights ago. When Israel come up out of Egypt, there were just two million people come, and just two million; just one... just two people went in. One out of a million. Did you know that? Caleb and Joshua. [Numbers 26:65]\n\nL-144 And Jesus, when He was on earth, they said, \"Our fathers eat manna in the wilderness. We're keeping the traditions. And we're doing this. We know where we're standing!\" [John 6:31]\n\nL-145 He said, \"I know your fathers eat manna in the wilderness, and they're every one Eternally separated. They're dead!\" [John 6:49]\n\nL-146 When the sperm comes from the male or female, there's a million eggs comes, there's a million germs come. And out of all them little germs, of the kind... If it's--if it's from the male cow, or the man, or whatever it is, there's just millions of germs, a million germs working. In there there's only one of those germs that's ordained to life, for there's one egg over there, fertile, to meet it. That's right. Only one egg it'll meet. Just like this body here setting here, and the germ comes from God. See? And watch that little germ come up among all these other germs, and wiggle around them, 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min right on past them, go over here and find that fertile egg and--and crawl right into it; and the rest of them dies.\n\nL-147 What if it was that way with the church today, one out of a million? See where it would be? \"Strait is the gate and narrow is the Way, and few there'll be that'll find It; because broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there'll be that go in thereat.\" \"Is that truth, Brother Branham?\" I don't know, but I'm just quoting Scripture. See? [Matthew 7:13, 14]\n\nL-148 Now, you're ordained to Life. You see It if you're ordained to see It. If you're not ordained to see It, you won't see It. Said, \"They have eyes but they can't see, ears and can't hear.\" How thankful you should be, church! How you should straighten yourself up from these things! How you should be on fire for God! That your eyes beholds what you see, your ears hears the things you see. Leadership! Why did you come here tonight to hear a Message like This? I'm branded across the world, by the churches, as a \"fanatic.\" Why did you come? The Holy Spirit led you here (see? see?) to listen. Circumcise! Cut away the things of the world, accept the leadership of Jesus Christ, or you'll perish as sure as the world. [Jeremiah 5:21], [Ezekiel 12:2], [Matthew 13:16]\n\nL-149 You have a choice of conduct. How you conduct yourself, that's up to you.\n\nL-150 You have a choice of wife. You go out and take your wife. You want to take a wife, you want to take one that's complementary to your... to what you want your... plan your future home to be. Could you imagine a man, a Christian man, going out and taking one of these modern Rickettas for a wife? Huh? Could you imagine? What's the man thinking about? What kind of a home is he going to have if he takes a striptease, a burlesque off of the street out here, a street prostitute? \"Oh,\" you say, \"now, wait a minute.\" How does she dress herself? See? See? Wear shorts and things, she's a street prostitute. \"Oh,\" you say, \"now, Brother Branham!\" Oh, them little ol' tight skirts, look like you're poured into, street prostitute.\n\nL-151 Jesus said, \"Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery with her in his heart.\" Then he's got to answer for that. And what'd she do? She presented herself. Who's guilty? Think of it. [Matthew 5:28]\n\nL-152 You say, \"They don't make any other clothes.\" They got goods and sewing machines. No excuse. Huh-uh. That's exactly.\n\nL-153 Now, I don't want to hurt you. And this is not a joke, this is THUS SAITH THE LORD from the Scriptures. It's exactly true, friend. I'm an old man, I haven't got much longer to stay, but I've got to tell you the Truth. If this is my last message, it's the Truth. See? Don't, sister. Don't, brother.\n\nL-154 And you fellows that's hanging onto a--a creed, and knowing the Word of God being vindicated right before you. The baptism of the Holy Ghost and these realities that we have today, and then, because of your creed, turn away from It? How can you be a son of God and deny the Word of God that's predicted for this last days that we're living in? How can you do it? How can the Bible call this...\n\nL-155 As I said last night about a--a king one time, down in the South when they had the colored down there was sold for slaves. Why, they was no more than just a--a used car market, you get a bill of sales on them. And I was alarmed, at a little place... I read one day where a--a broker come along to buy some, and he said, \"Well, now, I'd like...\" They was sad, you'd have to whip them, make them work because they was away from home. They was sold, slaves. And they in a foreign country they knowed nothing about, and they'd never be back home again, and they were sad. You had to whip them, make them work. But this broker come by a certain plantation.\n\nL-156 One young fellow there with his chest out, his chin up, you didn't have to whip him. He was right up, and he kept the morals of the rest of them up. The broker said, \"I'll buy him.\" He said, \"He's not for sale. Ain't going to. You ain't going to buy him, because he's not for sale.\" He said, \"Well, what makes him so much different?\" Said, \"Is he the boss over the rest of them?\" Said, \"No.\" Said, \"Do you feed him different?\" Said, \"No. He's a slave, he eats out there in the galley with the rest of them.\" 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min Said, \"What makes him so much difference?\"\n\nL-157 He said, \"I wondered myself, till I found out. Over in Africa (where they come from, where the Boers bought them, and brought them over here and sold them for slaves), over there his father is a king of the tribe. And yet, an alien, away from home, he knows he's the son of a king. So he conducts himself that way.\"\n\nL-158 What a rebuke to Christianity! We're supposed to represent God and Eternal Life. There's only one form of Eternal Life, and that's God. He alone has Eternal Life. And we are products of His, because we're genes of His Spirit. Then we should conduct ourself, women and men, like the Bible said for us to do. Not Jezebels of the street, and Rickies of the organization; but Christian gentlemen, sons and daughters of God, borned of the Spirit of God, manifesting the Light in our days and scattering It. That's exactly right. [John 3:15], [John 6:54, 68], [John 17:2-3]\n\nL-159 How far we've drifted from It! Why? The same thing this boy did here. He rejected, refused Eternal Life, because It would cost him his social standing, It'd cost him his--his--his luxury of money, It'd cost him his fellowship in the church, It'd cost him a lot of things. He knowed what It was going to cost him, he was a sensible boy, and he felt that he couldn't pay the price. Yet he thought, \"I'll just trust my religion and go on.\" But down in his heart he knowed there was something about Jesus Christ was different from them priests of that day. [Mark 10:22]\n\nL-160 And any Message that's come in, a genuine, borned Message of God, is different from the old trend. When a Divine healing went forth, not long ago, did you notice how the impersonators followed it? See? And every one of them went right in them organizations, staying there. Does anyone know that there had to be a Message follow that? Why, God don't entertain us! He attracts our attention with something, and when He attracts our attention, then He's got His Message.\n\nL-161 Look when He was first come on the earth, and started His ministry, \"O young Rabbi, we want You over here in our church. We... Come on down here.\" The young Prophet. \"Oh, we want You over here. Come here.\"\n\nL-162 But one day He stood up and said, \"I and My Father are One.\" [John 10:30] \"Oh, my! He makes Hisself God.\" [John 10:33]\n\nL-163 \"Except you eat the Flesh of the Son of man and drink His Blood, you have no Life in you.\" [John 6:53] \"He's a vampire! We have nothing to do with that.\"\n\nL-164 Them apostles set right there; thousands left Him, but those apostles were ordained to Life. He said so. They couldn't explain It; they believed It. They stayed right with It because, said, \"No man could do these works.\" [John 6:66]\n\nL-165 Even the priests knowed that. Nicodemus said, \"We know\" (the Sanhedrin council) \"that no man could do these works except it be from God.\" See? [John 3:2]\n\nL-166 Peter, on the Day of Pentecost, said, \"Jesus of Nazareth, a Man approved of God among you. God was with Him.\" [Acts 2:22]\n\nL-167 Look in the Scriptures, what the Scriptures said would do. Jesus said, \"Search the Scriptures, in Them you think you have Eternal Life. They are what testifies of Me. If you would have knowed Moses, you'd know Me, for Moses wrote that I would come, in the form that I would come in.\" He come as the Son of man. [John 5:39]\n\nL-168 He comes in three names, as God. Three (like Father, Son, and Holy Ghost), same God, it's three attributes. [Matthew 28:19]\n\nL-169 Now then, also, justification, sanctification....; Luther, Martin, and--and the--and the Pentecostal; same thing: three attributes, three stations, three church ages.\n\nL-170 Same thing: water, blood, and spirit. Oh, just as you go along, the three elements that takes you back into the body. Like it brings you from your natural birth, types your spiritual birth. The baby's born, the first thing's water, next blood, and then life. That's the way you come into the Kingdom of God, the same way. See? That's the way the Church comes in, the same way. Same thing. Now notice on these three things, God has formed His... forming His body. [I John 5:7-8]\n\nL-171 Now we find that in here, that you have a right in your choice. You choose the girl you want to marry; she accepts you, all right. 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min\n\nL-172 Then another thing, you have a choice of whether you want to live or whether you don't want to live. You choose now between Life and death. You can live.\n\nL-173 That boy had that choice. He was success in everything else, a religious man, but he knowed that when that... He spoke it of hisself, \"I've observed all these commandments since I was a youth,\" but he knowed he didn't have Eternal Life. See? And he had a choice to accept It or to refuse It, and he turned It down. That was the most fatal mistake he could ever made. The rest of it wouldn't amounted. It don't, it doesn't amount, unless you take That choice. [Mark 10:17-23]\n\nL-174 Now let us follow him at his choosing, and see where it led him to. Now, see where he chose. Now, look, he was--he was a rich man, he was a businessman, he was a ruler, and he was a religious man. All that!\n\nL-175 Today we'd say, \"Boy, he's a genuine Methodist, or Baptist, or a Pentecostal. He--he's a real fellow, real nice boy. Fine!\" Nothing you could say about him; friendly, nice, sociable, and everything. No immorals about him. He didn't probably smoke, drink, or run around to shows and dances, and whatever we'd call it today, as we would class a Christian. But that ain't Eternal Life yet! That ain't what we're talking about. He might have been loyal to his church, in which he probably was. But, you see, and what did it lead him to? Great popularity. Let's say, if he was a preacher, he could a-been... got a better church. He could a-been the state presbyter or a bishop. See? It leads you to popularity, and it led him to riches and to fame. [Luke 16:22-23]\n\nL-176 It might do the same thing today, you have a great talent to sing. I thought of that young man a while ago that sang that song here; how he had give that to the Devil, and now he get it back... And how different between him and Elvis Presley and some of these. Pat Boone, and a group like that, Ernie Ford, them guys, great singers; and take their talents, that God-given talents, and use it to inspire the--the works of the Devil. That's right. Some great singer selling their God-given talents for fame in this world, to become somebody. How could you become any more of a \"body\" than you could, to be a somebody, than to be a son of God?\n\nL-177 I don't care if you own the whole city, the whole world, and you haven't accepted the leadership of Eternal Life by the Holy Spirit (Christ), how you going to... Who are you, anyhow? You're a dead mortal, dead in sin and trespasses! Religious as you want to be; as faithful as you want to be to the church; preacher, if you want to be in the pulpit; but to turn down, you die!\n\nL-178 He was a great success. He was a great success here in this life. Certainly. We find him where we notice... Then we find this fellow, that he went... We follow him a little bit, and we see he got a great successful. And we follow him through the Bible. We notice that he--he... We find him a rich man. He's got such great big places, he was entertaining the judge and the mayor of the city, or whatmore. He's up on top of his roof, and he has great banquets; and plenty of waitresses, and women, girls, and everything else, around him. And there's a beggar laying at the gate, named Lazarus. He sweeps the crumbs off to him. We know the story. The next thing, he goes on successful, just like the churches today are getting. [Luke 16:19-24]\n\nL-179 A businessman setting here, telling me, \"Right here in California, that the church has to tell the labor union what to do.\" See, it's coming church and state again. It's right on you. You see, you're right in there, and you take the mark of the beast not knowing it.\n\nL-180 If you ever bought one of my tapes, get this when I get it, when I get home, The Trail Of The Serpent; and you'll see where it's at, see where this ends up at. Going home now to speak, if the Lord willing. It's about four hours, so I couldn't keep it at one of the meeting like this. I have to go up there where the church suffers with me so long, patiently. Notice. But now you can listen at the tape sometime in your home.\n\nL-181 Notice this, now we find out that he was a great success. Then we find him later till he was a greater success, until he said, \"I have got so much!\" Boy, he'd a-made a real genuine guy of this day. Wouldn't he? \"Even my barns has swelled out, they're bursting. And I've got so much till I said, 'Oh, soul, take your rest.'\" [Luke 12:16-19]\n\nL-182 But, what he done at the beginning, he rejected the leadership of Jesus Christ. His church, his intelligence, his 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min education, and all, had lead him to a success. All the Jews loved him. He give to them, he helped them, he might have done this, that, or the other. But, you see, he rejected the--the--the leadership of Jesus Christ, the Eternal Life. And that... The Bible said, He said, \"Thou fool, tonight your soul is required.\" [Luke 12:20]\n\nL-183 And now we find him (the next place) in hell; lifting up his eyes and seeing that beggar, that he turned out the street, in the bosoms of Abraham. What a fatal mistake! How that the churches had--had--had--had--had been all right in the way that they went, but they still hadn't had Eternal Life. [Luke 16:22-23]\n\nL-184 Reminds me of a sermon I preached here not long ago, A Thinking Man's Filter. You might have had it. I was going, walking through the woods, I was squirrel hunting (this fall) and I looked down. And, of course, I can't call the cigarette company. You know it. And there laid a--a cigarette pack laying there. And I just passed by it, looking for... in the woods. And I seen that package laying there, and I looked back again, it said, \"A thinking man's filter, a smoking man's taste.\" I just started walking on through the woods.\n\nL-185 And Holy Spirit said, \"Turn and pick that up.\"\n\nL-186 I reached down and picked it up, \"A thinking man's filter, a smoking man's taste.\" I thought \"American firm here, selling death under disguisement, to their own American citizens.\" A thinking man's filter? You... And a smoking man's taste?\n\nL-187 I was at the World Fair, with Yul Bryan... Brynner, and them up there, when he giving all that test. And how he put one cigarette and drawed the... across a marble and took the... Wiped up the nicotine and put it on a rat's back, a white rat, and in seven days he was so full of cancer he couldn't walk. And they said, \"You know, they say a 'filter,'\" said, \"it's a gimmick, sells more cigarettes.\"\n\nL-188 It takes so much nicotine to satisfy that devil. That's right. And when you take a filtered cigarette, it takes about four cigarettes to take the place of one. It's a gimmick to sell you more cigarettes. You cannot have smoke unless you got tar; and tar, you've got cancer. See how it is? And the blind Americans, looking for a rabbit to come out of a hat somewhere, they fall for it. You can't have it; it's death, I don't care which way you go, it's death any way you go. \"A thinking man's filter,\" a thinking man wouldn't smoke at all, that's right, if he's got any thoughts at all.\n\nL-189 Well, I thought that just can comply to the churches. See? I think, has God got a filter? Yes. And every church has got a filter. That's right. They filter ones that comes in, and they let a lot of death in too.\n\nL-190 How could you ever draw a denomination through God's Filter? How could you do it? How could you draw a bobbed-hair woman through that Filter? Tell me. How could you ever draw a woman that wears slacks through There, when \"It's an abomination for her to put on a garment pertains to a man\"? See, God's Filter would catch her out there, It wouldn't let her come in. (But the church has got their own filters.) So I say that there is a thinking man's Filter, that's God's Word, and It suits a holy man's taste. That's right, a holy man; not a church man, but a holy man's taste. Because It's pure, holiness, unadulterated Word of God! There is a thinking man's Filter. And church member, I advise you to use That one. [Deuteronomy 22:5]\n\nL-191 Because it brings in the world, and one lump of it is death. One lump leavens, the one little leaven leavens the whole lump. \"Whosoever shall take one Word out of This, or add one word to It, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.\" [I Corinthians 5:6]\n\nL-192 At the Garden of Eden, what caused death, and all this sorrow, every heartache, every little dying baby, every rattle in the throat, every ambulance screaming, every hospital, every graveyard? Was because Eve doubted one Word (not all of It), it just perverted It. Now, God said, \"Man,\" there, \"he was to keep every Word of God.\" Now, that's the first of the Bible. [Genesis 3:1-20]\n\nL-193 In the middle of the Bible, Jesus come, and He said, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" Not just part of Them, every one. [I Corinthians 5:6], [Matthew 4:4], [Luke 4:4]\n\nL-194 In the last of the Bible, Revelation 22, Jesus give the testimony of Himself. The Revelation of the--of the Bible is Jesus Christ. And He said, \"Whosoever shall take one Word out of here, or add one word to It, his part will be taken 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min from the Book of Life.\" [Revelation 22:19]\n\nL-195 Now, you go through that thinking man's Filter, you'll have a holy man's taste when you come out of There. Right. You'll have a saintly taste.\n\nL-196 Sister, you that wear those clothes, think of it. You're going to... You say, \"I'm virtuous to my husband.\" \"I'm virtuous to my boyfriend.\" \"I'm a virtuous girl.\" But what about that sinner that looked at you? When he answers for adultery, who did it? See, you'll be guilty. See it written in the Word, so it's the... See? Oh, be a thinking woman. Be a thinking... [Matthew 5:28]\n\nL-197 You might say, \"It might...\" Well, what if it does happen to be that way? He said so, and one Word can't fail. See?\n\nL-198 The great man told me not long ago, called me into his room, said, \"I'm going to lay hands on you, Brother Branham. You're ruining your ministry, preaching such things.\" I said, \"Any ministry that the Word of God will ruin, ought to be ruined.\" See? He said, \"I'll lay hands on you.\" Said, \"You was sent to pray for the sick.\"\n\nL-199 I said, \"Do you believe those things, brother?\" He said, \"No. But it's not our business.\" I said, \"Whose business is it, then?\" See? \"Well,\" he said, \"that's the pastor's business.\" I said, \"Look at the congregation.\" Uh-huh. That's right. See?\n\nL-200 Every year I pass through preaching these things, and I think, \"Surely they get It,\" next year I come back, there's more than ever. See? That's right. It goes to show that \"Many are called but few are chosen.\" [Matthew 22:14]\n\nL-201 The leadership is the Holy Spirit, friend. It leads you and guides you into all Truth, when He the Holy Ghost is come. Now think of that. Take the thinking man's Filter, that's the Bible. Not your creed, not your church; you'll be lost. Take the thinking man's Filter. [John 14:26], [John 16:13]\n\nL-202 That's where that boy didn't think. He took the church filter. He become popular, a great man, \"But in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torment.\" [Luke 16:23]\n\nL-203 Now you take the thinking man's Filter, Jesus Christ, the Word, and you'll desire a holy person's taste, because It'll satisfy that. If you got the Holy Spirit in you, This satisfies it.\n\nL-204 If the Holy Spirit isn't there, you say, \"Oh, well, I don't think that means any difference.\" Look what you've done right there! Same thing Eve done. You're right back in the same place.\n\nL-205 Now let's go a little farther. Now let's take... leave that man there, that didn't use the thinking man's Filter. He refused to accept the leadership of Jesus Christ, to Eternal Life.\n\nL-206 Now let us take another rich, young businessman, a ruler with the same opportunity that this man had. And accept It, he accepted the leadership of Christ. Now, there's two of them in the Bible that we're going to talk about. That one we see that refused It, now let's take this man: another rich, young businessman, and a ruler. And he accepted the Leadership.\n\nL-207 The Scriptures tell us about this fellow, if you want to mark it down, in Hebrews 11: 23 to 29. ... Moses, by faith, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; Choosing rather to suffer the afflictions of God... Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater treasures than all the treasures of Egypt:... [Hebrews 11:23-29]\n\nL-208 See, he accepted Eternal Life. Moses esteemed the--the--the reproach of Christ greater treasures than all the treasures the world had. Moses esteemed That the greatest. Now, this rich man didn't. [Hebrews 11:24-26]\n\nL-209 And Moses was a rich, young ruler, to become a Pharaoh. He was Pharaoh's son, and was heir to the throne. And he looked out to the impossible, a bunch of mud-daubers, a bunch of slaves. But by faith he saw the promise of God, through the Word, \"That his people would sojourn in a strange land for four hundred years, but would be brought out by a mighty hand.\" And he esteemed That (hallelujah) greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt, for he forsook 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min Egypt not knowing where he was going. He was led by Christ. He forsook! [Hebrews 11:26], [Genesis 15:13]\n\nL-210 And he had his foot on the throne, and he could been--been the next Pharaoh in Egypt. But he esteemed the reproach of Christ. The reproach! To be called that \"odd one,\" be called that \"fanatic,\" to take his place with the mud-daubers and the fanatics; because he seen that the hour, that the Scripture was promised to be fulfilled, was there then. [Hebrews 11:26]\n\nL-211 And O church, wake up! Can't you see the same thing tonight? The hour that's been promised is on us. Esteem the reproach of Jesus Christ greater riches than all the fellowship of anything; if it takes father and mother, church, anything else. Follow the leadership of the Spirit!\n\nL-212 Let us follow this Christ for a few... this Moses for a little while. There, I did that. Let's watch his life. The first thing, when he had accepted to take the reproach of Christ and forsake his education, forsake all of his wisdom... He was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. And all of his popularity, his throne, his scepter, his kingship, his crown, everything he had, he rejected it! [Hebrews 11:23-29]\n\nL-213 And this other fellow wanted it, and refused Christ; and this man refused that, and accepted Christ. And quickly what happened? He had to separate himself. [Hebrews 11:24-27]\n\nL-214 Hallelujah! The word means \"Praise our God!\" It's too bad that we're forgetting it.\n\nL-215 He rejected the thrones and the popularity. He could a-had young girls by the... wives by the hundreds, and he could a-had scepters under Egypt, rule the world! The world laid right at his feet, and he was heir to every bit of it. But by looking in the Scripture and seeing the day he was living in, and knowed that Something in him, that predestinated Seed of God went to work! [Hebrews 11:24-27]\n\nL-216 I don't care how popular you could be, or how this you could be, you could be a presbyter, you could be a pastor, you could be a this, that, or the other, but if that Word of Eternal Life by God's Word has been foreordained into you, and you see the thing at hand, it goes to work, moving out like that. [Brother Branham snaps his finger several times--Ed.] Start coming out! Begin to get It!\n\nL-217 And he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, because he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater treasures than all the riches of Egypt or the world. He esteemed That. Watch what he done, he followed It. Up, quickly he was ousted from his people, the people that once loved him. [Hebrews 11:24-26]\n\nL-218 It might cost you everything you got. It might cost you your home, It might cost you your friendship, It might cost your your stitch-and-sew party, It might cost you your place at the Kiwanis. It might. I don't know what It'll cost you, but It'll cost everything that's worldly or pertains to the world. You'll have to separate yourself from everything that's worldly. You'll have to do it. [I John 2:15], [Matthew 10:37]\n\nL-219 Moses laid everything aside and went into the desert with a stick in his hand. Amen! Days after days passed. And wonder if he thought he made a mistake? No.\n\nL-220 Many times people start out, and they say, \"Oh, I'll do it. Glory to God, I see It!\" Let somebody laugh at you and make fun of you, \"Probably I was wrong.\" [Hebrews 12:1-14], [Hebrews 10:30-34], [Matthew 24:13], [Mark 13:13], [II Thessalonians 1:4-6], [Mark 4:14-22], [James 5:10-11]\n\nL-221 He said, \"They that cannot stand chastisement are bastard children and not the children of God.\" See, they're worked up on the emotion. See, the seed that I talked about a while ago, that soul wasn't there to start with. It was anointed with the Spirit, and he done all kinds. Oh, you, they... When your spirit's anointed, you can... It's the real, genuine Holy Ghost, and you could still be a devil. [Hebrews 12:8]\n\nL-222 \"Oh,\" you say, \"Brother Branham!\"\n\nL-223 False prophets! The Bible said, \"In the last days there'd be false prophets.\" Jesus said, \"There shall rise false christs.\" Not \"false Jesuses,\" now, nobody stands still for that; but \"false christs.\" Christ means \"the anointed ones.\" Falsely anointed; they are anointed, but they are false at the bottom of it, and do great signs and wonders, speak in tongues, dance in the Spirit, preach the Gospel. [Matthew 24:24] 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min\n\nL-224 Judas Iscariot did it! Simeon... or no, I beg your... Caiaphas prophesied! Balaam, the hypocrite! Sure, done all the signs, everything, all the religious moves.\n\nL-225 But, you see, you put a cocklebur seed and a wheat seed in the same bed and pour the water down upon them and anoint them, they'll both rejoice. They'll both grow by it, the same water. \"The sun shines on the just and the unjust, and the rain falls on the just and the unjust, but by their fruits you shall know them.\" How can you keep from lining up with the Word? Amen. See what I mean? \"The water falls on the just and the unjust,\" anoint it. [Matthew 5:45], [Matthew 7:16, 20]\n\nL-226 Jesus said, \"They will come to Me in that day, say, 'Lord! Lord! Have not I cast out devils? Have not I done prophesied? Have not I done great things in Your Name?'\" He'll say, \"You workers of iniquity, depart from Me, I don't even know you. Go into eternal hell that's been prepared for the Devil and his angels.\" You see? What a Word! Falsely. Worship in vain, striving in vain. Why do you do that when you don't have to do it? Why take a substitute when the Heavens is full of genuine? See? You don't have to do that. [Matthew 7:22-23]\n\nL-227 Now we find Moses anointed, nothing could turn him back. His own brothers turned him down; that didn't stop him. He went right on into the wilderness. And one day out there, he met God face to face, with a Pillar of Fire hanging in a bush. Said, \"Moses, take off your shoes, your ground you're standing on is Holy. For I have heard the cries of My people, and I have heard of their groanings, and I remember My promise of the Word. And I'm coming down, I'm going to send you down there to take them out.\" Certainly. He met God face to face, he talked with Him. He was commissioned by God. [Exodus 3:5]\n\nL-228 God come right back, that same Pillar of Fire, and vindicated that prophet standing right there on the mountain; to prove that it was, when He took his hands and performed all kinds of miracles and things. Oh, they had the impersonators. Oh, sure. There was Jambres and Jannes, stood right around, done the same thing they did. But who was the original? See? Where did it start from? Did it come from the Word? Was it the hour? [II Timothy 3:8]\n\nL-229 And do you know that same thing's promised again in the last days? \"As Jambres and Jannes withstood Moses, so will these men, of reprobate mind concerning the Truth.\" See, in the last days. And do the same thing, (impersonate everything), right on in the same gully, \"Hog going to its wallow, and a dog to its vomit.\" [II Timothy 3:8], [II Peter 2:22]\n\nL-230 You Pentecostals that come out of them organizations years ago and cursed them, your fathers and mothers; and you turned right back around and done the same thing that they did, and now just the same wallow and vomit. See? If it made the Church vomit it out in the early Pentecostal age, it'll make It vomit it out again today. See? It has to be, though, it's the shuck, has to come. The tassel can't be the only one; the shuck has to come, see, the carrier. Now we're living in the last days, watch the things that's promised for the hour.\n\nL-231 Watch this Moses confirmed. Know! When he got out there, some of his own brethren turned up against him, wanted to make an organization. They said, \"You act like you're the only holy man among us.\" \"The whole congregation's holy,\" said Korah, Dathan. \"Let's choose out men and do something.\" [Numbers 16:1-3]\n\nL-232 Moses, he... I felt sorry for him. He went down, said, \"Lord...\" Fell down before the altar and said, \"Lord!\"\n\nL-233 God said, \"Separate yourself from them. I've had enough of it.\" Just opened up the earth and swallowed them up. That's all. See, he knowed his commission. [Numbers 16:21, 32]\n\nL-234 God don't deal with organizations, He don't deal with groups. He deals with individuals. That's right. Always. Not in groups; individuals, one person. In the last days, He said, \"I stand at the door and knock, and if any man...\" (not \"any group\") \"... any man will hear My Voice, I'll... and hear Me, I'll come in to him and sup.\" See, \"If any man can hear.\" [Revelation 3:20]\n\nL-235 How can--how could this microphone now produce my voice out there unless it was made thus? I could scream against that board, with all my might, and it wouldn't do nothing. Because this is ordained, and made, created, a microphone. And if the Word of God is in you from foreordination of God, in you, \"My sheep hear My Voice. They know My hour. A stranger they won't follow.\" See? It's got to be that first. \"All that the Father has given Me, they will come.\" Every one of them, see. [John 10:27] 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min\n\nL-236 Now he goes on, at the life's end here. He only passed... Notice when he come to the end of the road.\n\nL-237 And we're closing now because it's getting late, twenty-five minutes till ten. Notice. Now, at home that's early. About two or three o'clock we begin to say, \"Say, it's getting a little bit late.\" See? See? But now, I've preached a many a night, all night long.\n\nL-238 Paul preached this same Gospel in his day, and a young man fell off of a--a wall and killed himself. And Paul, with that same anointing and that same Gospel, laid his body upon him, he come to life again. They were interested. The church was being formed. Something was taking place. Notice what taken place here. [Acts 20:9]\n\nL-239 Moses, when he come down... This rich man, when he come down, the young ruler we talked about, all religious, and belonged to church and everything, fine, educated, a fine businessman, and everything, when he come to the end of the road, he begin to scream, \"There's no where to step!\" Where's his leadership? He had been led by his church, which is dead. He had been led by the dead world, and there wasn't nothing for him to step into but what the world had prepared for it: hell. [Mark 10:20-21], [Luke 16:22-23]\n\nL-240 But here comes Moses, a faithful servant who esteemed the reproach of Christ greater treasures than all the riches of Egypt. He come to the end of the road, an old man, a hundred and twenty years old. Walked up on the mountain, and he knowed that death laid before him, and he looked over into the promised land. And he looked; laying there by his side, there was his Leader, the Rock. He stepped upon the Rock, and the Angels of God packed him away into the Glory--the Glory of God, into the bosoms of God. Why? Eight hundred years later, he was still being led by his Leader. [Hebrews 11:24-26], [Deuteronomy 34:1, 5]\n\nL-241 We find him over on Mount Transfiguration, standing there with Elijah, talking to Jesus before He went to the cross, eight hundred years after death. The--the One that he esteemed, the reproach of his ministry, greater treasures than all the popularity of the world and all the money of the world, his Leader was still leading him. Oh, my! He was led! His Leader, He led through the death, the shadows of death. He was led to the grave. Hundreds of years later, there he stood again because, as his youth, he had chosen the leadership of the Holy Spirit. His name will be great when there is no more Egypt or treasures. When the pyramids are dust, and when Egypt is no more Egypt, Moses will be immortal among men because he accepted the leadership of Christ instead of going the way his church went. [Hebrews 11:26], [Matthew 17:2-3]\n\nL-242 There's others that did the same thing. Look at Enoch. He walked with God for five hundred years, and then he had a testimony that \"He pleased God.\" God had verified it, and said, \"There's no need of you dying, just come on up Home this afternoon.\" And he went up. [Hebrews 11:5]\n\nL-243 And Elijah. After bawling out bobbed-haired women and everything, as he did in his day, Jezebels with the paint on them, after he got so full of it, and--and had done all he could, and all them priests making fun of him, and everything else, he walked down at the river one day. And just across the river was the horses hitched to a bush over there, a chariot of fire and horses of fire. He stepped right on, and threw his robe off to the next prophet to follow him, and went up into Heaven. He accepted the leadership of Eternal Life, 'cause it was Christ that was in Elijah. Oh! Yes, sir! [II Kings 2:11]\n\nL-244 What was it? \"Follow Me!\" Now you must choose your leader. You've got to choose it, friends. Look in God's looking glass, the Bible, and see where you're at tonight. [Hebrews 4:7]\n\nL-245 A little story. A little kid, one time, lived out in the country. He never seen a mirror, and he came into the city to see his mother's sister. And she had a home... and the old-fashioned homes used to have a mirror on the door; I don't know whether you remember that or not. But this little boy, he had never seen a mirror. So he's playing around the house, and he looked in the... \"Huh?\" He looked at that little boy. And he waved, and the little boy waved. And he pulled his ear, and the little boy pulled his ear. And on like that. He kept walking up, close, and he turned around and said, \"Mama! That's me!\" That's me.\n\nL-246 What do you look like? What are you following? What have we done? You must choose your leader. Choose 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min today. You choose Life or death. Your choice will determine your Eternal destination, what you choose. Remember, Jesus said, \"Follow Me.\" And you're invited tonight to do so. And to follow Him to Eternal Life you must come on His terms, that's right, the Word. Not upon the creed, not upon the public opinion, not upon what anybody else thinks about It, but on what God said about It. [Matthew 8:22]\n\nL-247 You say, \"Well, Brother Branham, I know a woman just as good as she can be, she does this. I know a man that went through this.\"\n\nL-248 I can't help what they done. God's Word, He said, \"Let every man's word be a lie, and Mine be the Truth.\" You've got to come on His terms, come on His conditions, the Word. You cannot come through creed. You cannot come through denomination. You cannot mix It like that. There's only one thing you can do: accept It on His terms, that you're willing to die to yourself and all your thoughts, and follow Him. \"Get rid of all the things of the world, and follow Me.\" [Romans 3:4], [Philippians 3:8]\n\nL-249 I know that's a stern, cutting Message, brother. But I didn't come here and choose a--a message to the people just to try to make them sing, shout, holler. I been in heathen meetings where they done the same thing. I'm interested in your life. I'm a servant of God that's got to answer to God someday, and the ministry that the Lord has given me has vindicated itself thousands of times before you.\n\nL-250 Remember, Jesus said, \"Follow Me. Follow Me. Get rid of what you got, and follow Me.\" And that's the only way to have Eternal Life. That's the only remedy He give this man, was the only remedy He give this businessman, it's the only remedy He gives anybody. His choice, He makes His decision, it's perfect every time. And we must follow Him, is the only way to have Eternal Life. So the leadership of God is: follow the vindicated Word of the hour by the Holy Ghost. Let us bow our heads: [Matthew 16:24]\n\nL-251 I'm going to ask you a question, and I want you to be real sincere. I want the sister to play this for me, I Can Hear My Saviour Calling. I know it's an old-time altar call. And brother, sister, as we see, just look what's going on today. Now with your heads bowed, just think for a minute, look what's taking place.\n\nL-252 Did you read the newspaper last week what that man in England said? That \"The crucifixion of Jesus Christ was only a fake, it was only fixed up between Pilate and Him.\"\n\nL-253 Did you see what this American theologian said? He said that \"Jesus was just put to sleep on mandrake weed.\" Many of you theologians know, back there in Genesis where it talked of the mandrake weed. It'll put you to sleep like you're dead, your heart hardly beats for two or three days at a time. \"And when they give Him the vinegar and gall,\" they said, \"that was mandrake weed. And they put Him up there in the tomb, and He slept up there for three days. And, of course, when they went up there, they found Him walking, around.\" Could you imagine that? Theologians, seminaries, make-belief. Then how in the world... First place, the Bible said He refused it, when they put the vinegar and gall in His mouth.\n\nL-254 And another thing, if that be so, then why did those disciples \"who come and stole Him away,\" why did they give their life in martyrdom for Him? And fell, counted theirself not even worthy to die like He died; turned them upside down and sideways on the crosses and things. And if they were... knowed that He was a hypocrite and them ownselves being hypocrites, how would they have give their life for Him like that?\n\nL-255 Oh, you see, it's this intellectual day that we're living in. Education, civilization, and the modern trend of the day, is all of the Devil. \"Civilization of the Devil?\" Yes, sir! The Bible said it is. This civilization has death. \"Will we have a civilization like this in the other world?\" No, sir! We'll have a different kind of civilization. Education, all these things, they're of the Devil; science perverting the natural things, making something else. [Matthew 4:8-9]\n\nL-256 Look what they've done to you now. When young ladies... The Reader's Digest said, week after... month before last, I believe it was. The Reader's Digest said that \"Young men and young women go through the middle age, women in menopause between twenty and twenty-five years old.\" One more generation, they'll be nothing but... It'll be horrible-looking. See? What the creatures will be, softened, mucky. Look at the--look at the spirit, look how the spirit 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min in the church has got, hybrid, intermarried to the world. Oh, what a hour! Flee, children! Flee! Flee to the Cross! Come to Christ, let Him lead you.\n\nL-257 While we have our heads bowed, our eyes closed, and please bow your heart at the same time. Will you? I want to ask you a question. Do you really look at yourself, to God? And do you feel that you're not where you--you ought to be at this hour? Cause the Rapture could come at any time. See, it'll come. [I Corinthians 15:51-52], [I Thessalonians 4:16-17]\n\nL-258 There'd only be, if--if that statement I made a while ago is true, there'll only be about five hundred people in the Rapture, that's living, they'll be changed. Why, taking all Christendom together, Catholic and all, there's only five hundred million people, see, claims Christianity. And one out of a million, be five hundred people. There's that many people missing every day, across the world, that we can't even account for them. See, it'll come, and you won't even know it. People'll go on preaching, and saying... See, and it'll all be past. [Matthew 24:40]\n\nL-259 Like Jesus said. They said, the disciples said, \"Why say the scribes, say, 'Elias must first come'?\" [Matthew 17:10]\n\nL-260 He said, \"He's already come and you didn't know him, but they did to him what they said they would do.\" [Matthew 17:11-12]\n\nL-261 You know that you're not right with God, and you'd like to be remembered in... to God, that God would set your heart right with God. Would you just humbly now, in this very still moment, raise your hands? I don't care who you are, would you do it? You say, \"I'll raise my hands to God.\" God bless you. God bless you.\n\nL-262 Are you looking in the Mirror? I ask you in Christ's Name, are you looking in God's Mirror? [A brother speaks in another tongue. A brother gives an interpretation--Ed.] Amen. [Isaiah 28:11]\n\nL-263 I want to ask one thing. How many in here are Pentecostals? Raise your hand, are Pentecostals. Practically every one of you. Now, how many in here claim to be Christians? Raise your hands, ever where you are, claim to be a Christian. Did you know the Bible spoke of this, that this would happen?\n\nL-264 Even this happened in the Old Testament when they were wondering what they would do, how they could get away from the besiege that was coming. The Spirit fell upon a man and he prophesied and told them where to meet the enemy, and how, what to overcome the enemy. That was the Old Testament, same as the New.\n\nL-265 Now, somebody might say, \"That man, oh, that wasn't so.\" But what if it is so? You say, \"Oh, I've heard that before.\" But what if this is so? You see, that proves then that in here there's many that needs a change of heart, if that's the Holy Spirit speaking. There's things that needs to be done, so now it's with you. Just as I am, without one plea, But that Thy Blood was shed for me, And that Thou bids... (That's what, He called you just then.)... to Thee, O Lamb of God,... (\"I'll take away that stubborn heart, and put a heart of flesh in it that would yield to Me.\" See?)... come! Just as I am, Thou wilt receive, Wilt... (Will you make your choice tonight? You can do either one you want to.)... cleanse. You say, \"I've heard that before.\" But this might be your last time to hear It. Because Thy promise I believe, The old-fashioned altar calls, they're out of style today, but God still moves in them. Can't you feel It moving on you, church? ... I come!\n\nL-266 [Brother Branham begins humming Just As I Am--Ed.] Oh, think, today, the hearts are becoming stony, filled with the world, indifferent, church members, lukewarm, like that rich, young ruler; and don't know that the great Holy Spirit's standing, knocking at the door in this Laodicean Age. \"He that will hear My Voice (the Word), will open his heart, I'll come in to him and will sup with him.\" [Revelation 3:20]\n\nL-267 And the Spirit speaking through this brother a few minutes ago, said, \"I'll take that stony heart out of you, and 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min give you a heart of flesh, tender towards God.\" Look how it's become now, just a--a intellectual, emotion. See? Not a tender heart full of love and sweetness towards Christ. [Ezekiel 11:19], [Ezekiel 36:26]\n\nL-268 [Brother Branham begins humming the chorus--Ed.] Don't you want that kind of a heart? How you going to face Christ with an intellectual conception of Him? You've got to accept Eternal Life. ... was shed... (The preparation was made through the Blood.) And that Thou bids... (What did He do? Shed His Blood; and now bidding you, \"Come.\")... to Thee, O Lamb of God, I come! I come!\n\nL-269 Let's, each Christian, just raise our hands quietly now and pray:\n\nL-270 O God, please, Lord, catch this day that we're living. Oh, it's so hard, Father. Satan has just done so much to the people. Their hearts have become stony. Your Spirit speaks right out; Your Word comes forward, vindicate; but the old-fashioned, born-again experience, they're... it's become into a denominational, intellectual conception, a lot of music, a lot of shout, and a lot of carrying-on. But, really, that heart of flesh, that Spirit, that Eternal Life, It's certainly become foreign to the church.\n\nL-271 God, it breaks my own heart, and me a--a sinner saved by Your grace. It makes me feel so bad, Father, to see the church that You died for, the church that You're trying to redeem. I think of the vision You just give about that church of the United States and of other countries. What a horrible-looking rock-and-roll striptease it was. But somewhere along I seen coming forth another one, blessed.\n\nL-272 I pray, Father, that if any of those here tonight that's ordained to Life, or would like to accept It, that this'll be the hour they'll do it. Grant it, Lord. Break up the stony heart now, the old heart of the world. And if they want peace, they want something that satisfies, something that gives assurance, may they accept the leadership of Christ tonight to lead them to a--a Peace that passes all understanding, a Joy that's unspeakable and full of glory, or even something that death itself cannot harm. Grant it, Father. [Philippians 4:7]\n\nL-273 Now, with our hands up, I wonder if... How many in the building now would just say, \"I'm going to stand.\" Now, I don't care who's setting by you; It's God talking to you. And you really want to be a real Christian. See? Anything will... Unless that's an impersonation; oh, I'd just rather go on out and be in the world. I believe you would, too.\n\nL-274 Now, just examine yourself by the Word, by the Message. Examine what a real Christian should be: rugged, loving, not one of this modern Christianity. Why, it's soft, flexible, half dead, rotten, interbred. See, it's not the real Christianity; live any kind of a way, and belong to church. Don't you want that sweet fellowship with Christ, the Holy Spirit, that you're... the conformity of your own heart to the Word, move right up into Christ? If you want that, and would desire God to see your stand tonight right in this group of people, if you'll just do it. [II Corinthians 13:5]\n\nL-275 You say, \"Will that mean anything, Brother Branham?\" Oh, yes. Sure, it does. \"If you're ashamed of Me before man, I'll be ashamed of you before My Father and the holy Angels. But he that will confess Me and stand for Me in this land, I'll stand for him in that Land. I'll confess him before My Father.\" [Mark 8:38]\n\nL-276 Now, no matter who you are, woman, man, boy or girl, whoever you are, Christian or not Christian, minister, deacon, whatever you are, if you'll just believe with your whole heart, for just a moment, and do this much tonight just to let God know that you're sincere. \"God...\"\n\nL-277 \"Now look, I'm a Pentecostal,\" you say. \"I'm this,\" or whatever you are. \"I profess to dance in the Spirit. But, Brother Branham, I thought as long as we had that, we had It.\" You haven't.\n\nL-278 If you believe me to be God's prophet, you listen to my Words. See? That's a deception in this day. Didn't the Bible say, \"It'd be so close it would deceive the Elected if possible\"? The Elected, \"down to the soul.\" [Amos 3:7], [Malachi 4:5-6], [Matthew 24:24]\n\nL-279 But if you danced in the Spirit, still with the things of the world, there is something wrong. If you speak with tongues; Paul said, \"I can speak with tongues of man and angels, and still not even be saved.\" Uh-huh, both kinds, see. 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min \"I can do all the emotions, I can have faith, I can preach the Gospel, I can give all my goods to feed the poor, I can carry the Word in the mission fields across the... and still I'm nothing.\" See? It's that Inside of the inside, brother. That... Your spirit breaks up when you die, it takes its flight, but your soul lives. See? [I Corinthians 13:1]\n\nL-280 Now look at yourself. Really, are you a genuine Bible Christian, full of love of God? Remember, the Bible said, in the last days when this time takes place, He said, \"A marking angel went through the churches, went through the cities, and sealed only those who sighed and cried for the abomination that was done in the city.\" Is that right? Ezekiel 9, we know that's Truth. The marking angel went forth and put a Mark on their head, forehead, sealed them, \"Them that sighed and cried.\" [Ezekiel 9:4]\n\nL-281 After that come the slaughtering angels from the four corners of the earth, which is coming right away, we see it coming, wars moving right in that'll kill the whole earth off. There was nothing that they couldn't touch but them that had the Mark. [Ezekiel 9:5]\n\nL-282 Now pick out... Is your heart so concerned about the sinners, and the way that the church and the people are doing, till you can sigh and cry about it day and night? If not so, I'm wondering. That's the Scripture.\n\nL-283 Would you just stand and say, \"Dear God, I'm not standing because Brother Branham said so, but I heard his Word say that, and I'm going to do this. To You, Lord, I stand. I'm in need, Lord. Will You supply my need tonight here at this place? I stand.\" God bless you. God bless you. \"I'm in need, I want You to have mercy upon me.\" God bless you. \"I want to be the kind of a Christian that...\" [Philippians 4:19]\n\nL-284 Now, remember, the person that's standing by you is the same thing you are. I want you just to reach over and take a hold of their hand, say, \"Brother, sister, pray for me now. I want you to pray for me. I--I...\" Just say it with all Christian sincerity, \"Pray for me. I'll... I--I--I want to be right with God. You pray for me, I'm going to pray that God will give you the opportunity.\"\n\nL-285 I--I know that we're... We can't stay here much longer; you see that. We're--we're at the end time. All that believe that, say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen!\"--Ed.] We're... There's nothing left. Everything is gone. The churches is headed to the Ecumenical council. The world, it...\n\nL-286 Look here! Do you know what the Lord says about Los Angeles and these places here? \"She's gone!\" You remember what I told you, about two years ago, how that earthquake would come in Canada up here, Alaska? I also tell you that \"Hollywood and Los Angeles is sliding into the ocean. California, you're doomed! Not only California; but you, world, you're doomed! Church, unless you get right with God, you're doomed!\" THUS SAITH THE HOLY SPIRIT!\n\nL-287 Have you ever heard me use that Name unless it come to pass? Ask you! You've known me twenty years. Did I ever tell you anything in the Name of the Lord but what come to pass? If everything I've ever told you would happen, happened, say \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen!\"--Ed.] See? I tell you, now is the hour, you better be getting right, all of us. Now let's each one pray for the other:\n\nL-288 Dear God, as we stand here tonight, a dying people, our faces are turned towards the earth, the dust. We just... You have give us this cutting sermon, Lord. We see the example of two man. One of them, being a religious man, went to church but rejected the leadership to Eternal Life. And the other rejected the worldly fame and turned to Eternal Life. And we see both of their conditions tonight, according to the Bible: the rich man is in torment, and Moses is in Glory.\n\nL-289 Father, we want to be like Moses. We want to be led by Your Holy Son, Jesus Christ, to Eternal Life. Give It to our hearts tonight, Lord. Tear out the old stony heart; place into us the new heart, the heart of flesh, the heart that You can talk to and deal with, and we will not be haughty or different. May the Holy Spirit never leave, Lord. May It come and ordain this people. Speak to them; tear up their stony will, and put in the will of God. Save every one, Father. Give us of Thy love. Get us to a place, Lord, that we'll get away from all the--the emotional part, to the real solid part of the feeling... the heart-felt part, the deepness of the Spirit, the riches of God, the Kingdom of the Spirit in our hearts. Grant it, O Great Leader, great Holy Spirit, before You take Your flight into the skies with Your Church. 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min\n\nL-290 O God, let me go, Lord. Don't leave me behind, Jesus. Let me go with You, Father. I don't want to stay here on this earth to watch these tribulations coming on. I don't want to stay here in this insanity. I don't want to stand here when hideous sights... the people losing their mind. We look at man trying to act like beasts and look like beasts; and the women trying to look like animals, with the paints on their face. Knowing that these things are predicted to happen, that the thing will, they'll go so insane till locusts will rise up with hair like women to haunt the women; and teeth like lions, and things that You've said, the mental condition of the people will be completely gone. We see it in the making right now, Lord. Help us! Restore us to the sane mind of Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nL-291 O Great Leader of Eternal Life, we accept Your promise tonight, Father. I plead for this people. I plead for every one of them, in the Name of Jesus Christ, Lord. I pray that Christ the Son of God will come into the hearts of every one of us, Lord, and mold us and make us into new creatures in Jesus Christ. Grant it, Lord God. [II Corinthians 5:17]\n\nL-292 We love You. And we want our dispositions... our change to come into us, that we can be Your children, feel of Your Spirit moving in our hearts, Lord, tendering us and bringing us to realization of this insane age that we're living in. Grant it, God. When we see young women so caught up in the web of the Devil, young men, perverted minds, children, dope addicts, cigarette smoking, drinking, immoral, Satan's Eden.\n\nL-293 God, it taken You six thousand years, according to the Bible, to build an Eden. And You put Your son and his wife in there (his bride), to rule over it. And Satan come around and perverted it; he's got six thousand years, and he's built his own intellectual Eden through science, and education, and so-called intelligence, and he's built it into a mess of death.\n\nL-294 O God, take us back to Eden again, Lord, where there's no death, where there's no sorrow. Grant it, Lord. We stand humbly, waiting for the second Adam to come for His Bride. Make us part of Him, Father. We pray in Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nL-295 Do you love God? Can you feel... Do you realize what I'm trying to tell you? If you can understand this just raise your hands, say, \"I understand what you're trying to say.\" Can you see the insanity of this age? Look how it's gone, there's no even reasons among the people no more. It's gone! Where is our...? Even leaders.\n\nL-296 Look at our President! \"If they want Communism, let them have it. Whatever the people wants, let them have it.\" Where is our Patrick Henry's, our George Washington's? Where is our leaders that can stand for a principle? We haven't got them no more.\n\nL-297 Where is our churches, our ministers? Will take the people in just on probation, or come in, join the church and do this or have a little sensation or something. Where is those men of God, those prophets that stand out and dare to defile, defy all the things of the world?\n\nL-298 Where is those men of integrity? Where are they at? They're so soft, and through intellectual conceptions and things, till they're not here no more. O God, have mercy upon us.\n\nL-299 These hideous sights that's coming upon the earth. You can see how the people's moving right into it. It's an insanity. But when that thing strikes, the Church will be gone.\n\nL-300 God, let us be there. That's my prayer to the great Supernatural Being that's in this building tonight, the great Christ that still has Eternal Life. I pray Thee, Christ, as I'm here with my eyes open, looking at the church that You've redeemed with Your Blood. God, don't let a one of us be lost. We want to be right with You. So cleanse us, O, Lord, from all of our iniquities. Take away our sins and things.\n\nL-301 We seen You heal our sick, even raise our dead (come back to life through prayer), and we seen all these things happen, Father. Now bring us back to Life, spiritually; bring us back into realization of Eternal Life through Christ Jesus. Grant this, Father. I commit it all to You. In Jesus Christ's Name. Till we meet! till we meet! Till we meet at Jesus' feet; Till we meet! 65-1207, Leadership, Covina Bowl, Covina, CA, 120 min Look to Him. Let Him soften us up. ... we meet! God be with you till we meet again!\n\nL-302 Raise our hands now: Till we meet! till we meet! Brother Salano, ever who is following. [Someone says, \"Anything else?\"--Ed.] No. God bless you.

Box 4951 Naperville, IL 60567 USA Email: thevoice1017@lwbcast.org http://www.lwbcast.org/ Communion"}, {"id": "65-1212 - Communion.txt", "text": "L-1 Stirring message that Brother Pearry gave us just then from the Word of God. How true it is that \"We limit God and time God; and He's Eternal, we can't do that.\" So tonight we're facing something else now, is communion.\n\nL-2 Three years I waited for a church to come in Tucson, but it's here. Yeah, we're--we're here. So we thank the Lord, He just let us wait till we can appreciate it now.\n\nL-3 Now, there's one thing that I'd want to say just before we start the communion, is this, that I believe that we have seen enough in our day that we live in, that we ought to really give (every) all of our being to God. We--we should really serve God. I believe that He has blessed us with the direct answer to Scripture. As Brother Pearry gave it a few moments ago, that we--we are--we're at that time. We're not blind, we--we--we see that we're here, we--we've arrived. And we also can look around and see that the way that the human mind is leaving the people. That, we--we can't stay too much longer, we'd be in a complete insane institution, the whole world would be. See? So we--we're at the end time.\n\nL-4 Now, as Brother Pearry ended up there, seeing these things are true, see that they are true, they're not myth. They're not just something that we imagine. They're something that's been directly given to us by the Word of God and manifested publicly before us, that we know we are here. We--we don't know how long now, because again we come back to a watch, you see, what time it is. But we are... we know we--we're here, we're at the time. Whether God's time, I'd imagine...\n\nL-5 Someone give a little analysis one time that said that if God put up with him according... if He was to allot time, one--one thousand years is just one day. So if a man lived seventy years old, it'd just be a few minutes of God's time. See? Well, and said it'd be forty years, that wouldn't even mean time, hardly, He could bat His eye. See? See, just that's how quick it is, the whole thing, if it be lotted time; which, He doesn't have any time. So He just is Eternal. [Psalms 90:4]\n\nL-6 I believe it was Sarah back there... or, no, Joseph, the other night, said to me and Brother Pearry, said, \"Daddy, where, when did God come on the scene? Where did He come from?\" See? \"He had to have a beginning, didn't He? Didn't He have to start?\"\n\nL-7 I said, \"No. Anything that has a beginning has an end, but it's that which had not a beginning has no end.\" But, course, he's ten years old, that was kind of a--a real mouthful for him. See? And how could he receive that, knowing that something never did begin? Not only to him, it is to me. Now, see, it's just a great big dose for me, how it did ever begin. [John 1:1-2]\n\nL-8 Now we're fixing to observe something here that's really sacred. I was called on a few days ago, to some very fine Christian gentlemen that--that's never had this, and he understood that we taken communion literally. They take it what they call \"spiritual communion.\" And which, as far as communion, I'd say all right, 'cause communicate is \"to talk to,\" see. And the brother give me this Scripture, said, \"Brother Branham, don't you think now...\"\n\nL-9 Now, reason I'm saying this... It's all right, Brother Pearry? [Brother Pearry Green answers, \"Sure.\"--Ed.] See, that reason I'm saying this, so that you would understand what you're doing. You don't... if you walk into anything blindly, you don't know where, what you're doing. You can't have even confidence if you don't know what you're doing. But you must understand what you are doing and why you're doing it.\n\nL-10 He said, \"Now if we take the Word of God, isn't that God that we're taking?\" I said, \"Exactly right, sir, it's true. But we read here that they actually... Paul taught taking the literal Lord's supper. 'This do in remembrance of Me,' said Jesus. 'As oft as you take it in remembrance of Me, you show forth the Lord's death till He comes.'\" See? Now, we are to take it. [I Corinthians 11:24-25]\n\nL-11 We understand that Saint Paul, who ordained it in the Church, being the prophet of the New Testament. Peter, 65-1212, Communion, Tucson Tabernacle, Tucson, AZ, 32 min James, John, all of them, they wrote (why, Matthew, Mark, Luke) what Jesus did, as scribes. But Paul set the thing in order, he was the--he was the prophet of the New Testament. Just as Moses went into the wilderness to receive the inspiration to write the--the five Books of--of... the first five Books of the Bible, well, Paul also went into the desert and received inspiration from God, to set the New Testament Church in order and type It with the Old. [Galatians 1:17-18]\n\nL-12 Under there they had the sacrificial lamb, that Israel kept that for a memorial. It was actually used one time, coming out of Egypt. But then they kept that as a memorial all down through the age. Well, \"if the law being a shadow of things to come,\" you see. [Exodus 12:3]\n\nL-13 Now, I do believe that communion (what we call \"communion,\" now) is to... is \"the Lord's supper.\"\n\nL-14 Now, we only have three physical Divine orders left to us: one of them is--is communion; feet-washing; water baptism. That's the only three things. That's the perfection, of the three, see. And that's the only three orders we have. We realize that that was the issue given by Saint Paul in the New Testament. [I Corinthians 11:23-34], [John 13:1-17], [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-15 Now, if we would say \"the communion should just be taking the Word,\" I don't believe anyone has a right to take the Lord's supper until he has taken the--the Word of the Lord into his heart. See? Because I'm going... I'll read something for you in a few moments and you'll see. Now, notice. Then, why then would we--we would...\n\nL-16 On the same basis we could absolutely justify the Salvation Army. They do not believe in any form of water baptism, said, \"We don't need it.\" Now, if we don't need water baptism, why are we baptized? Said, \"The water can't save you, the Blood saves you.\"\n\nL-17 I'll agree with that. That--that's right, the Blood saves you, not the water. But we must take the water as an outward emotion that an inwardly work of grace has been done. See? So must we on communion! [I John 5:1-8]\n\nL-18 When we have taken the Lord, our Sacrifice, into us, as a matter of spiritual Birth into us, and His Body, we live by Him by the Word, we also should symbolize it because it's a commandment. \"Repent, every one of you and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins.\" [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-19 Paul said, \"I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you, 'That the Lord Jesus the same night in which He was betrayed took bread, and brake it and give it to the disciples, and--and said, \"Take and eat, this do in remembrance of Me.\" For as often as you take this bread, you show forth His death till He comes.'\" Now we find out that, in that, they had people who come and... [I Corinthians 11:23-26]\n\nL-20 This precious brother, a very dear brother, he came and he said, \"I never--I never did take it, Brother Branham, I don't understand what it is.\" Said, \"I been taught the other side.\"\n\nL-21 I said, \"But remember, we will admit that Saint Paul set it in order in the early Christian Church. They went from church... from house to house, broke the bread with singleness of heart, and so forth. Now,\" I said, \"he did put it in the Church. Galatians 1:8, he said, 'If an angel from heaven comes and says anything else, let it be accursed,' you see, see, the same one that had them to be rebaptized again from the baptism of John, to be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ.\" [Galatians 1:8]\n\nL-22 You see, there are three things that we must--three things that we must do as symbols: the Lord's supper, feet-washing, water baptism. See? There's...\n\nL-23 You say, \"Well, the...\" Now, the Salvation Army takes it from the point, \"The dying thief, when he died, he wasn't baptized, yet Jesus said he would be in Heaven.\" That's exactly the truth. That's exact. But, you see, he--he--he only recognized Jesus right there in the hour he was dying. See? That's the only--that's the only opportunity he had. He--he was a thief, he was away, he was out. And he, as soon as he seen that Light, he recognized It, \"Lord, remember me!\" And Jesus... That was true.\n\nL-24 But to you and I who know that we should be baptized, and refuse to do it, then that'll be between you and God. 65-1212, Communion, Tucson Tabernacle, Tucson, AZ, 32 min Same thing in communion!\n\nL-25 Now, when we take this communion, it isn't just the thing say, \"I'm coming up here and going to eat some bread, and I'll believe I'm a Christian.\" But, if you noticed, the Bible said, \"He that eateth and drinketh unworthily shall be guilty of the Blood and the Body of the Lord.\" See? You've got to live a life that--that... before the people, that... and before God and the people, that shows that you are--that you are sincere. [I Corinthians 11:27]\n\nL-26 Now, just a moment longer. Now, in the Old Testament when the sacrifice was made a--a statute or an ordinance. And so is water baptism an ordinance; so is feet-washing an ordinance; so is the Lord's supper an ordinance. \"Blessed is he that does all of His ordinance, keeps all of His statutes, all of His commandments, that he might have a right to enter into the Tree of Life.\" [Revelation 22:14]\n\nL-27 Now, notice in this now, that in that first, when it was first an ordinance of God to bring a sacrifice to the church, and to the temple and the altar, and offer your gift, and--and for your sins, the sacrifice of a lamb. Well, I can just imagine seeing some Jewish brother coming down the road, knowing that he was guilty, and he goes to the altar; or brings his fat ox or a bullock, or whatever he had, or a ram, lamb, something. He had brought it down the road just as sincere as he could come, he walked up there, keeping God's ordinance just as sincerely as he could.\n\nL-28 Then he laid his hands upon it, confessing his sins, and the priest placing this (his sins) upon the lamb, and the lamb's throat was cut, and--and then died for him. As he laid there, the little lamb kicking and bleeding, his hands being full of blood, and it flying all over him, (the little lamb blatting, dying), he would realize that he had sinned and something had to die in his place. Therefore, he was offering this lamb's death for his death. See, the lamb died in his place. Then the man done it with sincerity, with deepness of his heart.\n\nL-29 Finally, over and over it went again, over and over it kept going until finally it become a tradition. The commandment of God became a tradition to the people. And then here he come down, \"Well, let's see, this is so-and-so today, maybe I better go down. Yeah, I better offer a--a bullock.\" He went down, \"Well, Lord, here's my bullock.\" See, there's no sincerity in it, there's no understanding to it. [Isaiah 1:13-15]\n\nL-30 Now, we don't want to take communion like that. That's the same thing as we come to the Lord's table.\n\nL-31 Isaiah 35... no, I beg your pardon, Isaiah 60... Let me take that back. I--I--I believe it's Isaiah 28, is where we find this. I'm pretty sure that's the right chapter. He said, \"Precept must be upon precept; and line upon line upon line; here a little, there a little. Hold fast to that what's good. With stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to this people. And this is the Rest.\" [Isaiah 28:10, 11, 13]\n\nL-32 He said, \"All the tables of the Lord has become full of vomit. Who can I teach Doctrine? Who can I make to understand?\" See? I think that was the right Scripture, Isaiah 28. \"Who can I make understand Doctrine?\" See, \"the tables.\" [Isaiah 28:8]\n\nL-33 Now, we find out today that this great thing that we're fixing to do tonight, in commemoration of His death and His Body that we believe that we eat daily, or, just got through eating as our brother preached to us. Taking the Word of God, we believe It with all of our heart. We see It manifested; we see It given to us; we see It vindicated; we feel It in our lives. And we must come to this with a deep conscience of what we're doing, not just because it's an order. [Luke 22:19], [I Corinthians 11:24-25]\n\nL-34 You go into church, and many times they give out an old soda cracker or some kind of a--a something, break it up, and light bread or--or something, and--and break it up; and people who smoke, drink, everything else, because they're a member of the church they come and take the Lord's supper. Well, that's filthiness before God!\n\nL-35 Even the sacrifice, said, \"Your holy days and your sacrifice become a stench in My nose.\" Yet He ordained them to make that sacrifice. But the way they treated it, it become a stench, stink in His nose (His nostrils), the very sacrifice that He ordained. [Isaiah 1:13-15]\n\nL-36 That's the way we take the Word of God, too many Christians today (so-called) does that. We stand up here and teach this Word, and say, \"Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday, today, and forever,\" and teach the things that He 65-1212, Communion, Tucson Tabernacle, Tucson, AZ, 32 min promised us that He would honor, and say, \"Oh, well, that was for something else,\" our solemn worships just become a stink in His nose. He will not receive it, by no means. That's the reason, by our traditional habits!\n\nL-37 You don't take the Lord's supper by a tradition. You take it because it's the love of God in your heart, in keeping the commandments of God. See, that's what you take it for.\n\nL-38 So if you don't take it in sincerity, just it's a tradition, \"Well, our church observes communion once every Sunday, or once every month, or twice a year,\" and you go up, say, \"Well, it's my time,\" and--and then take the communion, why, it's a stink to God! See, that's just a tradition.\n\nL-39 Even like anything else, you--you've got to be sincere. God wants the depths of your heart. You remember, the very God that brought you here on earth is the One you're serving. See?\n\nL-40 You're doing this because He said so, because it's His order. Then we want to come up with deepness of sincerity, knowing that by God's grace that we have been saved. And we--we love Him and we feeled His Presence, and we--we see It change our lives. Our--our whole being is changed. We--we--we're different people. We don't live like we used to, we don't think like we used to.\n\nL-41 Like in the Book here, and the spot there we was talking about the--the two Books being One, the Book of Life. The first Book of life coming up, was when you were born, that was your natural birth. See? But then one time, way back down in there, there was a little grain of Life as I was explaining to some of the young sisters at the house this afternoon. See, there's a little grain of Life laying there, that you wonder, \"Where did It come from? What--what these strange things?\" [Revelation 20:12]\n\nL-42 I was saying this, taking for myself, like you was going to say, \"William Branham, well, forty years ago, the William Branham, it isn't the same one tonight.\" If somebody back there would say, \"William Branham, he was a rank rascal,\" see, because I was born of Charles and Ella Branham. In their nature I was a sinner, I came to the world, a liar, and all the habits of the world laid right in me. But down in there, too, was another Nature present, see, predestinated, was in there by God. In this same body, see, two natures in there.\n\nL-43 Well, I only catered to one. As it growed, I gooed as a baby, \"Dad-da.\" First thing you know, I become a liar, become everything else that's a sinner, because I raised up that way. But down in there was a little speck of Life all the time.\n\nL-44 I used to remember, as a little boy... (I hope I'm not holding you too long. But knowing...) Sitting out in the... on--on the creek bank, and I'd sit there and look around at nighttime. Pop and mom, they're gone on now to their rest. And them days they were sinners, there was no Christianity in our homes at all. And, oh, my, drinking, and parties, and carrying on; it made me sick, I'd take my--my lantern and my dog and go to the woods, to stay all night. In the wintertime I'd hunt till the party was over, maybe daylight in the morning. Come home, wouldn't be over, I've laid on top of a shed and sleep, waiting for daylight to break.\n\nL-45 Then I'd think of how that times, then being out there in the summertime, get my sticks and put them down for a little windbreak, where if it rained; lay there and have the poles sticking in the water, fishing; my old coon dog laying there. I'd say, \"Looky here. You know, last winter I camped right here one night, I built a fire right here when I was waiting for my old dog here to tree, and I had a fire here. It was froze five inches deep in the ground. But, little flower, where did you come from?\" See? \"Well, and where'd you come from? Who come out here and planted you? And what hothouse did they bring you out of? Or--or what about it, where'd you come from?\" See? That little flower, I'd say, \"Why, it was froze, and everything, and I built a fire on top here. Besides the freezing element, there was a heat element laying here on a big old log where I burned you. And yet here you are, and you're alive. Where'd you come from?\"\n\nL-46 What was it? There was another William Branham. See? A little spot of Eternal Life down there, from the--the--the genes of God, the Word of God that was placed in there. Each one of you can think of similar things. See, It was working.\n\nL-47 Then look up to the trees, and I think, \"Leaf, I seen you fall off last year, and why are you back there again? 65-1212, Communion, Tucson Tabernacle, Tucson, AZ, 32 min Where'd you come from? What brought you here?\" See, It was that Eternal Life working in the body.\n\nL-48 Now, then one day as I walked on, that Voice talking, \"Don't never smoke, drink, so forth.\" And the young fellows and all got older. See, there was Something moving.\n\nL-49 But yet all at once I looked up, and I said, \"I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham. There's Something calling.\" Like my little eagle, \"I'm not a chicken. There's Something up yonder, somewhere. O Great Jehovah, Whoever You are, open up! I want to come home. There's Something in me, calling.\"\n\nL-50 Then I was born again. That little Life was laying there, the life of water was poured upon It, then It begin to grow. Now, that old life was forgiven, put in the sea of God's forgetfulness, to never be remembered against me no more. See? Now we stand justified (as though we never had sinned) in the Presence of God. [Hebrews 8:12], [Hebrews 10:16-17]\n\nL-51 Then when we come to the Lord's table, we must come in reverence, love and respect, of \"Look where we would have been if it hadn't been for Him.\" See? Look where it would've... [Isaiah 53:6]\n\nL-52 Therefore, Paul, I think, in saying this, \"Wherefore, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for the other.\" That is, other words, just wait a few minutes, pray, check yourself out. And if you know a brother is in there, just about to do something that's wrong, or something, and you pray for him, too. See? See, \"tarry one the other,\" wait just a minute, pray. If there's any feelings between you or something, don't--don't do it--don't do it, go make that right first. See? Go straighten that up first, because they want to come here just as pure as we can be, and our thoughts of one another and to God, and to each other, and then we come in fellowship around the table of the Lord. See? [I Corinthians 11:33]\n\nL-53 And we do this because that we are giving thanks to Him, and among one another. Eating the bread between each other, drinking the wine between each other, as His Blood and His Flesh.\n\nL-54 \"Except you eat the Flesh of the Son of man and drink His Blood, you have no Life in you.\" See? You see, that's what the Bible said. Except you do it, there's no Life. You see? You are then, more or less, showing you are ashamed to identify yourself as a Christian, because of the life that you live. And then this is really the showdown. Then if you don't do it, you have no Life. If you do do it unworthily, you are guilty of the Body of the Lord. [John 6:53]\n\nL-55 Same thing in water baptism. If we say, \"We believe on Jesus Christ, He saved us from sin, and we are baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ,\" why, we bring--we bring disgrace to Him, we do the things that's wrong and we--we'll have to pay for that. And another thing, when we do that, we are trying to profess one thing and do another. [Romans 6:8-14]\n\nL-56 That's the trouble of us today. What I think... I'm saying \"us,\" me, and the church that the Lord God has let me speak to in these last hours, that we believe we're in the closing time. We believe that God has give us a Message. It's been ordained of God, It's been proven of God, It's been showed of God. Now we must come to Him with reverence and with love, and with--with purity of heart and mind and soul.\n\nL-57 You know, the hour will soon arise when--when right among us will be... the Holy Spirit will speak out like It did in Ananias and Sapphira. Remember, see, that hour is arriving. See? And we are... Now, you just remember that, see, that God is going to dwell among His people. That's what He wants to do now.\n\nL-58 We can receive the Message, as saying... If I was a young man and--and hunting for a wife, and I could find a wife, I said, \"She's just perfect. She's a Christian. She's a lady. She's all this, I got confidence.\" No matter how much confidence, how much I think she's nice, I've got to receive her, she's got to receive me; see, upon these vows.\n\nL-59 Well, it's the same thing we find is the Message. We see It's right. We see God vindicates It's right. It's perfectly right. Year after year, year after year, It continues right, continues right. Everything It says, happens just exactly the way He said. Now, we know It's right, but, see, don't do it from an intellectual standpoint. If you do, you got a second-handed religion. See? We don't want a second-handed religion, something that somebody else has experienced it and we are living off of--of their testimony.\n\nL-60 As I believe it was Jesus said to Pilate, something, a word I was thinking, and He said there just a few moments ago, \"Who told you that?\" Or, \"Was it revealed to you? How did you know these things?\" in other words. I don't know just what the word is now, it's been a long time since I read it, but, \"How did you--how did you know this? What? How? 65-1212, Communion, Tucson Tabernacle, Tucson, AZ, 32 min Who revealed this to you?\" About Him being the Son of God. \"Who revealed it to you? Did some man tell you that? Or,\" as Jesus said, \"is it My Father in Heaven which has revealed it to you?\" See? See? \"How did you learn it, a secondhand or is it a perfect revelation from God?\" [John 18:33-34]\n\nL-61 Is this communion just something I go up for it, an order, say \"Well, the rest of them take this, I will too\"? It's a revelation that I am part of Him and I'm part of you, and I love you and I love Him, and we're taking this together as a symbol of our love to God, and our love and fellowship to one another.\n\nL-62 Now I want to read some from the Scripture. And then I guess... Where do you... Whichever way Brother Pearry desires today. I wish you'd read it with me, if you got your Bible. I Corinthians, the--the 11th chapter, and begin with the 23rd verse.\n\nL-63 And then also, at our tabernacle, we've always observed this and feet-washing, always, because they go hand in hand together. I believe the brother announced that \"Wednesday night\" because of the crowds and you don't have enough to... room to get the people in for feet-washing, they're going to observe--observe this Wednesday night. [John 13:4-17]\n\nL-64 Now, 23rd verse of the 11th chapter of I Corinthians, listen at Paul now. Now remember, and keep this in mind, Galatians 1:8, \"If we or an angel from heaven preaches any other gospel unto you,\" (than this Gospel that he had preached) \"let him be accursed.\" See? For I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had gave thanks, he brake it,... said, Take and eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. [I Corinthians 11:23], [Galatians 1:8]\n\nL-65 Now, let me stop right here, to say: but taking the body of the Lord Jesus Christ in this communion, does not mean that that communion is the literal body of Christ. That's Catholic. I do not believe that that's right. I believe it's only an ordinance that God made with us, see, it isn't the actual body. It's... Now, it's really a little piece of kosher bread. It's just an ordinance.\n\nL-66 Neither do I believe that the baptism of Jesus Christ (in the Name of Jesus Christ) in water does forgive your sins. I do not believe that you... I believe you could be baptized all day long... Now, I know that there's perhaps people sitting here who come from the Apostolic church, I mean, or the United Pentecostal church, which they teach that. But, you see, I--I do not believe that the water forgives sins. Or, if it was, then Jesus died in vain. See? I believe that it's only an ordinance of God, see, to show that you have been forgiven. But to be baptized for regeneration, no, I--I--I don't believe that. I don't believe that water forgives sins. [Romans 6:3-5]\n\nL-67 Neither do I believe that this bread and wine has anything to do with you, only keeping an ordinance that God has ordained for us to do. See? That's right. I believe water baptism is the same thing. I believe it's compelling to us to do it, that He had done it all for our example. And He done this for our example. And He washed feet for our example. [John 13:14-17]\n\nL-68 Now, \"After the same manner also,\" 25th verse: After the same manner also he took the cup, and when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me. For as oft... (Remember now!)... For as oft as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do shew forth the Lord's death till he comes. (How long? \"Until He comes!\" See? See?) Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. [I Corinthians 11:25-27]\n\nL-69 Let me stop just a minute. The reason he said this, you noticed in another verse here, another chapter, that he said, \"I understand when you--when you come together you're eating, even getting drunk at the Lord's table.\" They misunderstood it, you see. They just glutton-ed in, see. Just like people are doing today, just live any kind of life and 65-1212, Communion, Tucson Tabernacle, Tucson, AZ, 32 min take it. See? He said, \"You got homes to eat in, see. But, this is an ordinance that we should keep, see.\" Now: But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. (See?) [I Corinthians 11:28-29]\n\nL-70 What are you? You're a Christian, you live before everybody as a Christian. And if you take that and don't live as a Christian, you're not discerning the Lord's Body. You're putting a stumbling block in somebody else's way, see, as they see you trying to do that and then not living what you're supposed to live. See, you're not discerning the Lord's Body. Now watch what it... what the curse of it is: For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many are sleep. (The right translation of that word, Brother Pearry, is \"dead.\" See? See, \"many are dead.\") For if we--for if we would judge ourself, we should not be judged. (See, if we judge ourself we won't be judged. See?) But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. (See, not any attach to the world.) Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tarry one for the other. (See?) And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come. (See?) [I Corinthians 11:30-34]\n\nL-71 Now, in other words, don't just come to take it as a... As I said a while ago, about what the Jews, their sacrifice, they... It was wonderful, it was given by God, but it got to a place where they didn't do it in sincerity and reverence and in order, then it become just a... it become a--a stench in His nose. [Isaiah 1:13-14]\n\nL-72 Now, the same thing is by our coming to take the Lord's supper, that, we must come knowing what we are doing. Just like when you go into the water to be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, you know what you're doing, you're putting on to the church what God has put in you, Christ. [Acts 2:38]\n\nL-73 When we take this, it shows to the church, that, \"I believe every Word of God. I believe that He is the Bread of Life that come from God out of Heaven. I believe every Word that He says is the Truth. And I live by It, to the best of my knowledge, God being my Judge. Therefore, before my brothers, before my sisters... I--I do not swear, I do not curse, I do not do these things, because I love the Lord, and the Lord knows it and bears me record. Therefore, before you, I take the parcel of His body, to know that I am not condemned with the world.\" See, there you are, then it's a blessing.\n\nL-74 And, remember, I could give many testimonies on this, where I've took that and explained it in a sickroom, and seen them healed.\n\nL-75 Remember, when Israel taken the type of this, they had journeyed forty years in the wilderness and their clothes never even wore out, and they come out without one feeble one--one among them, with two million people as a type of this. Well, what will the Antitype do? If the body of a sacrificial animal did that for them, what would the Body of Jesus Christ, Emmanuel, do for us? Let's just be reverent when we come. Let us be just as reverent as we know how, to come. . [Exodus 12:1-17] Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
