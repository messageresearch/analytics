[0:02] [Music]
[0:12] worship.
[0:15] [Music]
[0:29] Amen.
[0:32] It's good to be here this morning
[0:37] [Music]
[0:40] to give God the honor and the praises
[0:44] &gt;&gt; for what he's done.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; We are so glad to be here.
[0:51] Pastor John the Apostle
[0:57] [Applause]
[1:06] [Applause]
[1:10] apostle wanted to be here this morning
[1:14] and um
[1:16] we thank God that we could be here.
[1:26] [Music]
[1:28] Hallelujah.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; Are you happy this morning?
[1:36] [Applause]
[1:46] &gt;&gt; We've come to fill up our vessels. Amen.
[1:51] picking up our cups
[1:56] &gt;&gt; because that's what we have need of
[2:00] &gt;&gt; in this later hour.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; We just want more of the oil. Amen.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09] [Applause]
[2:15] &gt;&gt; Because it's the requirement of today.
[2:18] Amen.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; You want to say, Lord, we're not going
[2:24] to give our oil away.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; It's the most important thing to us
[2:30] &gt;&gt; for this day and this our way. Amen.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; That's what we have need of. Amen.
[2:38] If you have your Bibles this morning,
[2:47] &gt;&gt; did you enjoy the singing? Don't you
[2:49] appreciate the the choir musicians?
[2:53] [Applause]
[2:59] &gt;&gt; That's what we want. We want oil in our
[3:01] lamps. Amen. To keep us burning
[3:04] &gt;&gt; till the break of day. Amen.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:10] [Music]
[3:15] Can we turn to um
[3:21] Matthew
[3:22] 6
[3:25] verse 8,
[3:29] [Music]
[3:37] Revelation Ians
[3:43] 3
[3:51] verse 17. Amen.
[3:54] If you got Matthew 6 verse 8, it says,
[3:59] well, let's read from verse 7. But when
[4:01] you pray, use not vain repetitions,
[4:06] as the heathens do, for they think that
[4:09] they shall be heard, for them much
[4:12] speaking.
[4:15] Be not ye therefore like unto them,
[4:19] for your father knoweth what things you
[4:21] have need of before you ask him.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:27] He already knows what you have need of
[4:29] before you ask him
[4:32] &gt;&gt; because he's your father. Amen.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; We are people
[4:40] that's needy
[4:42] &gt;&gt; of him.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; That's why that song says he looked
[4:47] beyond my faults.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; And he saw my needs. Amen.
[4:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:54] [Music]
[4:56] And uh Revelations 3:17 says, "Because
[5:00] thou sayest,
[5:02] I am rich and increase with goods and
[5:06] have need of nothing.
[5:09] And knowest not that thou art wretched
[5:12] and miserable
[5:14] and poor and blind and naked."
[5:18] Hallelujah.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; May God add a blessing to the reading of
[5:22] his word. You may be seated this morning
[5:26] just for a few minutes.
[5:28] [Music]
[5:38] I think the worst thing that God can
[5:41] hear come out of our mouths is
[5:46] we have need of nothing.
[5:49] Amen. The Leodian church age told God
[5:52] that we have need of nothing. And yet
[5:55] God says you are miserable.
[5:58] You are naked.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[6:01] &gt;&gt; You are wretched. You're poor. You are
[6:03] blind. Amen.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; Because you say you have need of
[6:07] nothing.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; But God knew that they had need
[6:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; of all these things. Amen.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brham says in the
[6:18] exposition of the seven church ages, I
[6:22] have need of nothing. Now when anybody
[6:25] says I have need of nothing, he could
[6:28] very well be saying I have everything.
[6:31] When you say you have need of nothing,
[6:33] you're actually saying I have
[6:34] everything.
[6:36] Or he could be saying I don't want
[6:39] anymore as I'm full. Now
[6:42] you can express this any way you want
[6:45] and it all adds up to the fact that the
[6:47] church is complacent.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; She is satisfied with what she has. She
[6:54] either figures she has it all
[6:58] or has enough. And that is exactly what
[7:02] we find today. Amen. They feel they have
[7:05] it. Amen. That's why those foolish
[7:08] virgins slept because they felt they
[7:11] never needed any oil.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; But I thank God. God will have people
[7:17] that says, "Lord, I need more."
[7:21] [Applause]
[7:27] &gt;&gt; David wasn't satisfied with the full
[7:29] cup. He wanted his cup to overflow.
[7:32] Amen.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:35] [Applause]
[7:38] Amen. And I think that's the worst thing
[7:40] you can tell God is I have everything. I
[7:45] don't need anymore.
[7:47] But Lord, we want to say we need more
[7:50] oil. Amen. With this oil,
[7:52] [Applause]
[7:57] we so scarce
[7:59] and you can't find it. There's only a
[8:01] little bit left. Amen.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we I thank God for health
[8:06] tabernacle. I thank God for a ministry
[8:09] &gt;&gt; that's not satisfied.
[8:12] [Applause]
[8:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; We know God,
[8:18] we have need of you.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; We want more of you.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; We want more of the Holy Ghost.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; We want it on a Wednesday. We want it on
[8:29] a Monday. We want it on a Tuesday. We
[8:32] want it every day. Hallelujah.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; We want the oil. Amen.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to be complacent.
[8:41] Amen. We don't want to be satisfied. We
[8:43] don't want to say we have enough.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; But we want to say, God, we want more.
[8:48] Hallelujah.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; We need more.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:52] [Applause]
[8:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:56] [Music]
[8:58] &gt;&gt; We definitely need more. Hallelujah.
[9:00] Amen.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. The brother Brandon says,
[9:05] "Hallelujah. The God of this evil age."
[9:08] So God be with you. I'm sure that
[9:10] there's one that will be with you.
[9:13] That's Jesus Christ. And he can be. He's
[9:15] the only person that's omnipresent. And
[9:18] he's also omnipotent. So he can supply
[9:21] your every need. And omniscience also
[9:24] knows your need. Ne needs of what you
[9:27] have need of. So he knows because he's
[9:31] omnicient. He knows all things.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; So he knows what tabernacle has need of.
[9:36] Amen.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; He's only present.
[9:40] Hallelujah. And he can supply every
[9:43] need. Hallelujah.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; He says the God who is rich in mercy.
[9:57] All that I I'm all that I ever hoped to
[10:01] be, I have derived from his grace and
[10:03] mercy.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; I was wretched. I was miserable. I was
[10:08] poor. I was blind.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; But by grace, he has healed me.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; And I'm strong and healthy.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; By the grace of God,
[10:19] I have got eyesight.
[10:23] I have eat, drink, I have whatever I
[10:26] have need of.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; He never promised to supply my wants.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; But he promised to supply my needs.
[10:32] Amen.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He will supply your need,
[10:37] not your wants. Amen.
[10:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:40] [Applause]
[10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; He promised it and he's more than able
[10:48] to give it to us. Amen.
[10:51] He says in the fallen a part of the
[10:54] world and they prayed for a Messiah.
[10:57] They prayed for a messiah.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; But here's what I want to say. If he
[11:01] would come, would we receive him or
[11:04] would we do like they did?
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Would we refuse him?
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Do we know what we really need?
[11:10] Sometimes we want pray for our desires.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; And sometimes our desires is not our
[11:16] need. We must realize that we do not
[11:20] understand what we need. We think we do,
[11:23] but God promised to supply our needs.
[11:26] And that he'll do.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll do that.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; But sometimes you will pray for your
[11:32] desires. You pray for your wants, but
[11:35] God will supply your every need. Amen.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; He won't supply your wants, but he will
[11:42] supply your needs. Amen.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:47] Amen.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; He says in the exposition of the seven
[11:52] church ages, there are those who would
[11:54] not take the Holy Spirit. They won't
[11:57] take the Holy Spirit. If God opened the
[11:59] heavens and showed them them, showed
[12:02] them a sign that it's time for them to
[12:04] take the Holy Ghost. Even if God shows
[12:06] them a sign, they won't take the Holy
[12:08] Ghost.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; Now, they all they are all saying and
[12:12] trying to prove that they have it all.
[12:15] They tried to prove out there that they
[12:17] have it all. They got the word. They got
[12:19] this. They got that.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; But we realize, amen, that they don't
[12:23] have everything.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Or they have enough. They say they have
[12:27] enough. Yet, is that the truth? Compare
[12:30] this 20th century church to the first
[12:33] century church. Go ahead, do that. Where
[12:35] is the power? Where's the love? Where is
[12:37] the purifying church that withtood sin
[12:40] and walked with faith toward Jesus?
[12:43] Where is the unity? You can't find it.
[12:46] If this church has it all it has all it
[12:50] needs, why were they crying out for more
[12:52] of God in the book of Acts?
[12:55] &gt;&gt; Though they didn't have it all, and yet
[12:57] they had far more than they have today.
[13:00] Hallelujah.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Acts had far more than what the church
[13:03] has today, but they cried out for more.
[13:06] Amen.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; They say they have it all, but the book
[13:12] of Acts. Amen. He said, "Lord, we don't
[13:14] have enough.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; We want more." Hallelujah.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; Tell them that I've come to tell you
[13:20] this day that there is more of God. If
[13:24] you want more or need more of God, there
[13:27] is more of God. Amen.
[13:30] Hallelujah. Don't be satisfied.
[13:34] Don't be satisfied. Say, "Lord, I need
[13:37] more. I need more. I need more. I need
[13:40] more." Hallelujah.
[13:44] Hallelujah. I need more.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; I need more. Hallelujah.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says in where has thy
[14:02] strength gone Samson? You little seminar
[14:06] vitamin fed seminary born rooster. Do
[14:10] you only know you heading for the frying
[14:12] pan? Amen. That rooster is heading for
[14:15] the frying pan. Well, what in the world
[14:19] are you crowing about? See, what you
[14:23] need today
[14:25] is the good old-fashioned baptism of the
[14:28] Holy Ghost to preach to preach the
[14:30] people eternal life in Christ. For he
[14:34] lives just the same today as he was
[14:36] then. What good does pretty feathers and
[14:40] intellectuals getting them little
[14:42] pallets all dressed out here and things
[14:44] like that? Do you realize you're heading
[14:47] for the pan? And how many people is
[14:50] heading for the flying pen? The feathers
[14:53] are nice. They're intellectuals, but
[14:54] they're heading for the flying pen.
[14:56] Amen. What good does it do? What's all
[15:00] your intellect going to amount to? What
[15:03] we need today? What we need today is get
[15:08] away from the kind of stuff and back to
[15:11] the Holy Ghost. Back to the power of
[15:14] God. Back to the oldfashioned meetings.
[15:17] Back to the all nighting meetings.
[15:19] Praying and staying at
[15:22] self. That's what we need. Amen.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; Do you believe church? That's what we
[15:28] need today is more of God. Amen.
[15:32] [Applause]
[15:34] Hallelujah.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Can you say
[15:38] hallelujah?
[15:41] [Applause]
[15:50] &gt;&gt; They say we don't need it, but the al
[15:52] tabernacle says we want it. Amen. If you
[15:55] don't need it, we want it. Amen. We
[15:57] don't want intellectual speeches. We
[16:00] want the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. We
[16:03] don't want just the lamp, but we want
[16:05] oil in the lamp. The baptism of the Holy
[16:08] Ghost. Amen. We want Hallelujah. Because
[16:11] we need it more than ever before. Amen.
[16:16] [Applause]
[16:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[16:25] [Applause]
[16:28] Hallelujah.
[16:30] [Applause]
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:38] I'm just going to run through it and I'm
[16:40] going to give over to Pastor John. Amen.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; What What do you have need of? You don't
[16:46] need a motor car. You don't need a
[16:48] house. You don't need new clothes. You
[16:51] don't need anything. Hallelujah. Amen.
[16:55] What you need for today?
[16:57] What do you need for today?
[17:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We want to say like the
[17:02] apostle says, we need oil for today. We
[17:05] need the Holy Ghost for today.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They cut it off, but we want
[17:11] to say we need it. Amen.
[17:14] Hallelujah. We need it more than ever
[17:16] before.
[17:17] [Applause]
[17:23] Let us hear what the prophet says. What
[17:26] will they need for today? Let's hear
[17:28] what our prophet says, what we need for
[17:31] today. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm just going
[17:34] to concise it out of all his sermons.
[17:36] What he says, what we need for today.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham says in the
[17:42] token, what we need today, what we need
[17:45] today. Hallelujah. Not what we need
[17:48] yesterday, but what we need today. Amen.
[17:52] [Applause]
[17:54] &gt;&gt; Is another baptism of the Holy Spirit
[17:58] and have the real power of God that
[18:01] identifies the works that Jesus Christ
[18:04] promised for this day. Not so much as
[18:08] that day, but this day. The promise that
[18:12] he made here. That was his promise here.
[18:17] He would pour out his spirit. Now he has
[18:20] promised it again in the last days. And
[18:23] what he would do. Amen. And that's what
[18:26] we need today.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; He says in perseverance, what we need
[18:31] today is a house cleaning from the pit
[18:34] all the way to the janitor and they
[18:38] starting over again and get some genuine
[18:41] faith into the people. That's what we
[18:44] need today in W of Bethlehem. What we
[18:47] need today is an opening of the word
[18:49] that lives not dead world but a living
[18:52] word that he's the same yesterday, today
[18:56] and forever. That's what we need today
[18:59] in W of Bethlehem. He says what we need
[19:02] today is a fresh pouring out of the Holy
[19:06] Spirit upon the hearts of the people.
[19:10] That's what we need today. In the token,
[19:13] he says, "What we need today is a
[19:16] refreshing of baptism of the Holy Ghost
[19:19] spirit back in the church. Not a
[19:22] celebration, but the falling up of the
[19:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost." He says the
[19:28] world is falling apart. What we need
[19:31] today is not educational systems.
[19:35] It's not it's not it's not lectures.
[19:38] What we need today is the gospel handled
[19:41] by the power of God to vindicate the
[19:44] word of this hour. Amen. We need the
[19:48] Holy Ghost to vindicate the word for
[19:51] this hour.
[19:52] [Applause]
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe it? That's
[20:01] what we need today. That's what we need
[20:04] today. That's what we need today.
[20:07] [Music]
[20:10] [Applause]
[20:13] Hallelujah.
[20:14] [Applause]
[20:18] &gt;&gt; He says in the world is the world is
[20:21] again falling apart.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you
[20:25] what we need today is the word of God
[20:27] anointed for this age that will bring
[20:30] forth the power of the Holy Ghost again.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need the power of the
[20:37] Holy Ghost again.
[20:39] [Applause]
[20:42] What we need today is a good
[20:43] old-fashioned backwood sky blue
[20:46] sunkilling religion and the baptism of
[20:49] the Holy Ghost back into the church
[20:51] again. A cleaning out, a gun barrel
[20:53] straight, a sky blue religion. We need a
[20:57] cleaning out and a starting all over
[20:59] again. That's the truth.
[21:02] [Applause]
[21:08] What we need today is a God send back to
[21:11] a born again experience of the Bible.
[21:14] What we need today is a message anointed
[21:17] with a messiahship of Christ. What we
[21:20] need today is a real man of God. What we
[21:23] need today is a real man of God who
[21:26] stands on the word and tells the truth
[21:29] about him. That's what we need today. We
[21:32] don't need a back to front caller man,
[21:35] but we need a man of God for today. For
[21:39] today. We need a man of God for today.
[21:44] Brothers, we need a man of God for
[21:47] today.
[21:48] [Applause]
[21:52] Have you found a man of God for today?
[21:55] People, have you found a man of God for
[21:58] today?
[22:06] [Applause]
[22:09] [Music]
[22:12] [Applause]
[22:15] Hallelujah.
[22:16] [Applause]
[22:18] &gt;&gt; That's what I say today. What we need
[22:21] today is men with experience. We need
[22:24] men with experience. We don't need man
[22:28] that has just come now lately and think
[22:31] they have something. But we need a man
[22:34] that's got experience that knows the
[22:37] tricks of the enemy. A man that knows
[22:40] God. A man that walks with God. A man
[22:44] that's filled with God. A man that's
[22:46] anointed of God.
[22:49] That's what we need today. He that's
[22:53] what we need today. Phil says that's
[22:56] what we need today.
[23:07] [Applause]
[23:14] [Music]

[36:42] a shepherd.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; I don't feel one witch doctor. I don't
[36:52] see one.
[36:54] But one medicine works. When you have a
[36:56] man of God in your midst, he meets the
[37:00] challenge.
[37:01] Even the Soma, even the Motech cannot
[37:05] work when you have a man of God in your

[38:27] [Music]
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Thy word and thy staff, they comfort me.

[38:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; What does the shepherd do? He prepares a

[38:58] When you feel the evil,
[39:01] &gt;&gt; when you feel that you don't feel like
[39:02] God is with you, then God puts a table
[39:05] there.

[39:45] boiling.
[39:48] It's running over. Then the devil says,
[39:51] "Wow, let me get out of here
[39:54] &gt;&gt; because my cup, my cup, it runs over."
[40:03] &gt;&gt; We got a man of God here.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; We've got the anointing of God here. We
[40:09] have the power of God in our roots.
[40:15] [Applause]

[42:54] near you.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:58] Amen.
[43:00] Amen. The devil says God is not much. He

[45:56] Anointed
[45:58] [Applause]
[46:00] [Music]

[52:05] [Applause]
[52:09] [Music]
[52:16] I thought um two weeks ago
[52:21] we will
[52:23] I wanted to come to Moapani
[52:27] and then we had a funeral
[52:30] and every time
[52:32] I want to come something falls
[52:36] &gt;&gt; and um
[52:39] I waited
[52:40] [Music]
[52:42] And um that the other day I told
[52:44] Jonathan and Jude
[52:48] &gt;&gt; this one day
[52:51] you
[52:55] [Applause]
[52:55] [Music]
[52:59] [Applause]
[53:02] [Music]
[53:07] are.
[53:11] So, we made it.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; And um
[53:17] &gt;&gt; I think we've been blessed already.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Are you getting a triple blessing?
[53:36] [Applause]
[53:40] [Music]
[53:53] [Music]
[53:53] [Applause]
[53:56] Pray that God bless you father.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; As I said with the last combine now
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Jacob
[54:07] [Music]
[54:08] wasn't so much worried about the
[54:10] birthight.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; He was worried about the blessing of the
[54:15] birthight.
[54:17] [Applause]
[54:24] &gt;&gt; The trouble, the trouble came in with a
[54:26] blessing
[54:28] &gt;&gt; and not with a birthight.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my god.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; And then when he had the blessing,
[54:33] &gt;&gt; he wasn't satisfied.
[54:36] And he bumped into the angel
[54:38] &gt;&gt; and he told the angel, "You better bless
[54:40] me again."
[54:43] &gt;&gt; And the angel blessed him again.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; He blessed him
[54:53] so much
[54:56] &gt;&gt; that he changed his name to Israel.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; And then God says, "No, because you
[55:02] blessed twice.
[55:05] I'll call your homeland
[55:09] Israel
[55:13] &gt;&gt; because it's a double blessing.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:18] [Music]
[55:23] &gt;&gt; We thank God for the blessing
[55:27] &gt;&gt; on the birthright. Everybody's got a
[55:28] birthight.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Talk about the Holy Ghost wherever you
[55:32] go.
[55:34] But that's just a birthright.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; But we're looking for the blessing.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; That don't cease.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; It's there in every service.
[55:46] Is there we come together
[55:50] and uh it never ceases.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; So
[55:56] I greet you again.
[55:59] Nice to see the temple there. Amen.
[56:03] [Applause]
[56:16] I thought if I come over here, I want to
[56:18] preach on something and this is the
[56:20] thing I would like to preach on
[56:24] or maybe just try to speak on it.
[56:29] And um
[56:31] it's a thing that I
[56:34] feel we have to be careful,
[56:38] very careful.
[56:42] It's um
[56:44] maybe just a warning
[56:50] &gt;&gt; for everybody that's in here of
[56:51] tabernacle.
[56:56] And it's a thing
[56:58] that God
[57:02] don't pull back on.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; You can play around with anything else.
[57:11] [Music]
[57:13] But with this thing,
[57:19] you don't fool with it.
[57:24] And I would like to take scripture
[57:29] in Psalm 92
[57:32] verse 10.
[57:35] If you have your Bibles with you,
[57:48] but my horn shall thou exalt my horn.
[57:53] Whatever little power I have,
[57:56] &gt;&gt; you will exalt it, Lord.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Like the horn of a unicorn.
[58:05] I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; I shall be
[58:14] anointed
[58:18] &gt;&gt; with fresh oil.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; And then we know Matthew 25:3 says the
[58:26] foolish virgins took no oil with them.
[58:31] Let us pray. Father,
[58:37] as I also have to be
[58:40] careful
[58:45] with oil,
[58:48] I pray that you'd undertake for us this
[58:51] morning.
[58:53] Bless your word,
[58:57] anointed.
[58:59] [Music]
[59:00] May it go from here
[59:04] to the uttermost parts of the earth
[59:08] as a warning. Lord,
[59:12] let us once again
[59:15] value our values
[59:20] and not let it slip.
[59:24] I ask it in Jesus' name.
[59:27] Amen. And amen. Amen.
[59:31] [Applause]
[59:34] If I
[59:36] if I should entitle this message,
[59:40] I'll entitle it
[59:43] the lost anointing.
[59:48] The lost
[59:52] anointing.
[59:54] Now, when you lose something,
[59:57] it means that you did have it before,
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; but you lost it. Something happened
[1:00:07] that you don't have it anymore.
[1:00:12] And I do not think there is a church
[1:00:17] upon the face of the earth
[1:00:22] that can boast
[1:00:25] like we do
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; of having the anointing.
[1:00:36] What was that?
[1:00:40] We are warned
[1:00:43] not to lose it.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture says,
[1:00:52] "Anoint me
[1:00:55] with fresh." It doesn't mean you weren't
[1:00:58] anointed.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; It means you were anointed.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; But something happened with your
[1:01:07] anointing.
[1:01:10] You lost it in some way.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; And because you lost it,
[1:01:19] you need a fresh
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; anointing.
[1:01:28] If you lost
[1:01:30] 50 rand,
[1:01:33] it means you had a 50 rand
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; but something happened
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; that you lost it.
[1:01:44] If you had
[1:01:46] the oil
[1:01:51] and you lost it,
[1:01:54] it means that you were experienced
[1:02:00] of having the oil.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:02:08] amen.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; We need
[1:02:12] a fresh
[1:02:16] Bathe of oil
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; for a fresh anointing.
[1:02:24] [Applause]
[1:02:30] This means
[1:02:33] the oil on the old anointing.
[1:02:37] That means the old oil
[1:02:43] either dried up
[1:02:46] or
[1:02:48] you lost it
[1:02:50] or
[1:02:52] some wise crack.
[1:02:56] maneuver you
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; away from it.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; And now you don't have it
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; what you had
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; before.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Like Esau,
[1:03:17] Esau had it.
[1:03:20] It was his.
[1:03:22] It belonged to him.
[1:03:25] and he didn't value it
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; and he lost it.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Samson
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; was anointed of God,
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; heavily anointed.
[1:03:43] There was nobody that was anointed like
[1:03:45] him.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; And yet he had it,
[1:03:52] but he lost it.
[1:03:55] Somebody stole it from him.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; A deceived church.
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Some intellect
[1:04:05] got the oil away from him.
[1:04:10] And he lost
[1:04:13] it.
[1:04:15] Eli the priest
[1:04:20] had the anointing
[1:04:22] was the high priest
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; highly anointed from a prophet
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; and yet
[1:04:34] he lost the oil
[1:04:38] and the Bible says it was kabot Amen.
[1:04:42] [Music]
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Means the glory of the Lord has departed
[1:04:48] from you.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Had it,
[1:04:55] owned it,
[1:04:57] but he didn't appreciate it.
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:03] Week after week, month after month,
[1:05:07] Wednesday after Wednesday,
[1:05:10] convention after convention,
[1:05:13] Easter after Easter, we have the
[1:05:16] anointing.
[1:05:18] [Applause]
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; It was ours all the time.
[1:05:26] [Applause]
[1:05:29] But friends,
[1:05:33] have we still have it like
[1:05:36] we always had it?
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Is there still an excitement
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; before you leave home and need to be in
[1:05:43] the church of God?
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Is there still an excitement
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; that hey, I want to serve God?
[1:05:52] Is there stood an excitement
[1:05:55] that hey I'm a son of God?
[1:05:59] Is there still a joy unspeakable
[1:06:03] that I'm a daughter of God?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Or did we lose our anointing?
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Is it too hard for you to clap your
[1:06:15] hands?
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Did you lose your anointing?
[1:06:20] Is it too hard for you to say amen?
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Did you lose your anointing?
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Is it too hard for you to put on some
[1:06:31] dancing shoes?
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Or did you lose your anointing?
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of a lost anointing.
[1:06:40] [Music]
[1:06:50] [Applause]
[1:06:51] Samson
[1:06:54] lost his anointing.
[1:06:57] The foolish virgin
[1:07:00] lost the oil.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says she went to look all
[1:07:04] over to get the oil,
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; but she couldn't find it.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; She lost it.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Bonnie.
[1:07:14] Don't let us lose
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; the anointing.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Don't let us lose the oil.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:26] Every service,
[1:07:28] every prayer meeting,
[1:07:31] every prayer that you put up, every
[1:07:34] callers that you say, every hand clap
[1:07:38] that you clap your hands with, say,
[1:07:41] "Give me oil in my land.
[1:07:44] Give me burning. Give me burning to
[1:07:57] The lost anointing.
[1:08:00] You hear it from church to church.
[1:08:04] You hear we have no anointing. The
[1:08:08] church is dry. There's nothing in the
[1:08:11] church. The young people, the young
[1:08:14] girls, the young boys says it's
[1:08:17] monotonous
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; to go to church.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; You know what?
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; You lost your anointing.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Church
[1:08:30] of today, you lost your oil.
[1:08:41] an elaborate
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; while I'm here.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be one drop of oil
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; that's going to be spilled
[1:08:53] [Music]
[1:08:54] [Applause]
[1:08:55] all.
[1:08:57] [Applause]
[1:09:17] Yes, Lord.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; It means that you once had it
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; but you lost it.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Some slick preacher,
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; intellectual preacher,
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; eloquent speaker
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; talked you out of it.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:37] And now you sit in a church
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; where God left long ago.
[1:09:45] [Music]
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; You had it before.
[1:09:55] Hebrews 6:4.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:59] The Bible says
[1:10:02] they tasted
[1:10:04] of the heavenly gift.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; If ever there was a church that tasted
[1:10:12] of this heavenly gift
[1:10:15] is us.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:20] [Applause]

[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; It tastes so good.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That we don't want to stay
[1:10:40] out of church.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; It tasted so good
[1:10:47] that we dragged our Torah to the church.
[1:10:51] It tasted so good that we made our
[1:10:54] husbands and wives follow us to the
[1:10:57] church.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; It tasted so good that our neighbors is
[1:11:02] in the church.
[1:11:05] [Applause]
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Is it fullfasting good?
[1:11:13] [Music]
[1:11:15] [Applause]
[1:11:17] [Music]
[1:11:19] [Applause]
[1:11:25] and were partakers
[1:11:29] of what?
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Of the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; I don't hear you.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Partakers of what?
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; You were a partaker.
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:44] You are not a
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; spectator.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; You are conceded.
[1:11:56] [Music]
[1:11:56] [Applause]
[1:11:59] [Music]
[1:12:02] [Applause]
[1:12:04] Thank you, Lord.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; You clapped your hands. You spoke in
[1:12:07] tongues.
[1:12:09] your love of life.
[1:12:11] [Applause]
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; We are the partaker.
[1:12:15] [Music]
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Now, for that person that's a partaker
[1:12:21] of the Holy Ghost, for him to fall away,
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; for him to lose it, it's nearly
[1:12:29] impossible to be.
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:34] [Applause]
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Why? because it's a lost anointing.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; You lost your anointing.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Let us not lose
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; our anointing.
[1:12:56] [Music]
[1:12:58] [Applause]
[1:13:04] [Music]
[1:13:05] Look where he is.
[1:13:07] When Esau When Esau lost his anointing,
[1:13:13] look where he landed up. The word of God
[1:13:16] says
[1:13:18] he went to go look for it.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; He went to go and search to get it.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; He went from place to place to try and
[1:13:27] get repentance, but the Bible says he
[1:13:31] didn't find it.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; He lost it. He lost it forever.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; He could never get it again.
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; It was gone.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin
[1:13:51] when she lost it, when there was nothing
[1:13:55] oil left nowhere, Brother Bram says she
[1:13:59] went to go look for it. And uh the wise
[1:14:02] version told uh the the foolish version,
[1:14:04] you going to buy
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; and they tell you must love. Where was
[1:14:09] the love then?
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; There's no time for love.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; There's no time for love.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; It's time for oil.
[1:14:25] [Applause]
[1:14:27] And the Bible says
[1:14:29] And the Bible says that the foolish
[1:14:33] virgin went to go look for oil and
[1:14:36] brother Bruno says they didn't find it
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; gone.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Look what happened to them.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Open the door."
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; And the voice says, "I know you not.
[1:14:51] I don't know you,
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; you know, just just because of oil,
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; but Lord, I got the lamp. I got the word
[1:14:58] of God. I've got I've got the mechanics,
[1:15:01] Lord. I've got it here. He says, I know
[1:15:03] you're not.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Mechanics is only the word of the
[1:15:11] spirit.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; It's not the spirit. The spirit brings
[1:15:14] the word.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] So the lamp is no good.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; We rode to church this morning.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; And how many people has gone to church
[1:15:26] and they got big Bibles
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; in their hands and going to church? And
[1:15:33] I said, "My God, look at that. That's
[1:15:35] only lamp.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; But where's the oil?"
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; That's only the worm.
[1:15:45] Where's the oil?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Many a many end time believer has gone
[1:15:52] to church this morning with a spoken
[1:15:55] word in his hand and the Bible in the
[1:15:58] other hand. Amen. And they go to the
[1:16:01] church and there's no oil.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Then what good is the spoken word?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; What good is the Bible?
[1:16:14] If there's no oil to make it alive,
[1:16:16] [Applause]
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; look where Samson landed up.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; He says, "Let me die now. I got no
[1:16:32] anointing." Hallelujah.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Look at Eli the high priest landed up.
[1:16:46] He broke his neck
[1:16:49] and Kabot came over.
[1:16:52] Friend, as you sit in this church
[1:16:56] and you search yourself with oil and
[1:16:59] there's any wicked way in you,
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; why don't you get rid of it?
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Any wicked way.
[1:17:16] Hallelujah.
[1:17:20] Hallelujah. Look
[1:17:25] on Zedekiah and Micaiah.
[1:17:28] Zedekiah said, "Micaiah,
[1:17:32] where did the spirit of God go when he
[1:17:34] left me?"
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; That means once he had the spirit.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; But now he don't have it.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Lost anointing
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; to somebody now. Who's up?
[1:17:53] [Applause]
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; It shows you
[1:18:08] that you got to keep on filling up.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:14] shows you you can't take a chance
[1:18:19] to stay out of church,
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; brothers. You might lose a cup of oil.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; It shows you that when it is here,
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; you grab it with two hands.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; You valued your family.
[1:18:42] [Applause]
[1:18:51] Oh my God.
[1:18:54] So Jude quoted one little Bethlehem.
[1:18:58] What do we need today?
[1:19:01] A fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost. Fresh
[1:19:04] oil. Fresh baptism.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; We need a fresh baptism.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:11] Hallelujah.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; We're going to act like mad people.
[1:19:18] [Applause]
[1:19:33] That's
[1:19:35] [Applause]
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; what a fresh anointing will do.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Samson. Oh, Samson.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Heavy anointed of God.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Heavy anointed
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:19:53] killed a thousand men,
[1:19:56] stroking them with a jaw born of an ass.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Samson,
[1:20:05] could tear the mouth
[1:20:08] of a lion
[1:20:10] like you put a hot knife through butter.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Samson.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Samson.
[1:20:19] He could coin a riddle.
[1:20:22] from his own testimony
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; that nobody could answer.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Samson,
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; oh Samson,
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; he could pay his debts
[1:20:38] to 30 Philistines just like that
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; because he promised them if he knows
[1:20:44] they're little, he'll pay them 30 pieces
[1:20:46] of
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; garments. And he paid them
[1:20:52] Oh, Samson.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Samson. He could take
[1:20:58] 300 foxes.
[1:21:00] One man catches 300 foxes. So anointed
[1:21:05] is a man and tie their their tails
[1:21:09] together
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; and send them into
[1:21:14] the fields of the Philistines
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; with a burning torch on it. Mhm.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; One man could do that.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; How many foxes is in the pulpit today
[1:21:29] that tell tales, Amen, to the
[1:21:32] congregation until they lose their
[1:21:35] anointing. Until they found out that the
[1:21:39] oil is gone, they tell tales. Amen.
[1:21:46] [Applause]
[1:21:50] And it's strange. He catches foxes.
[1:21:54] And when somebody say you're a fox, that
[1:21:56] means you're a scall.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; And Jesus says, "Could tell Herod that
[1:22:01] fox.
[1:22:03] [Music]
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; We got too many foxes that lost their
[1:22:08] anointing
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; in the pulpits today.
[1:22:13] [Music]
[1:22:14] Hallelujah.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; There's no oil coming from the head
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; from the pastor
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; down into the skirts of the
[1:22:23] congregation.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:26] [Applause]
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:22:36] it's the lost
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; anointing.
[1:22:41] My
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Samson could do all those things.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; When the anointing was fresh on him,
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Samson could do all those things.
[1:23:00] When he felt the atmosphere of the Holy
[1:23:04] Spirit was upon him,
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; a thousand men meant nothing to him.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Because of the anointing.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the anointing breaks the
[1:23:16] yoke.
[1:23:18] [Applause]
[1:23:33] Samson,
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; when you walk down the street,
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; the people will notch one another.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; There goes Samson.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; The mighty one.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; He could even walk down the very streets
[1:23:51] of Kaza.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:54] And a guazians will say, "Leave that man
[1:23:57] alone."
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Because if he's anointed,
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; he can kill thousands just like that.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; That's when the anointing is fresh.
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:21] Samson
[1:24:24] was untouchable
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; when the anointing is on him.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; They have to they have to stand back
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; when the anointing is on him.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; that hell knows
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; when the anointing is on you. Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; That not one demon
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; could come and take a chance
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; because the yoke gets broken
[1:24:56] by the anointed.
[1:25:03] [Applause]
[1:25:10] And that's when the oil was still fresh
[1:25:12] on Samson.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; But when he gave
[1:25:19] away the secret
[1:25:22] and the secret was they brought in
[1:25:29] some dead worship. Brother Brandham says
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; that was a secret.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Did you give away your secret?
[1:25:38] by formal
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; dead worship. Sure.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; And the minute he gave away the secret,
[1:25:48] the minute he gave away the thing that's
[1:25:52] supposed to keep the anointing,
[1:25:55] the minute he gave away his wedding
[1:25:57] garment,
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; the anointing left.
[1:26:06] [Applause]
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; The oil left.
[1:26:11] Then he had a lost anointing.
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; And you know the pity and worst part of
[1:26:24] it all,
[1:26:28] the Bible says he knew it not
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; that the anointing left.
[1:26:40] Hallelujah.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; They say
[1:26:48] the Bible says
[1:26:51] when that anointing left him,
[1:26:54] you know what Samson cried out?
[1:27:00] You know what he cried out?
[1:27:04] He said, "I'll go out
[1:27:08] like you
[1:27:11] like all the other times. I'll go out
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; and I'll avenge myself
[1:27:18] like I avenge myself when I killed a
[1:27:21] thousand of them.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; I'll go out myself."
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; And I'll do it again. And the Bible says
[1:27:31] you would not
[1:27:33] that he had a lost anointing.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Samson
[1:27:39] was relying
[1:27:41] on the God of yesterday.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Right there now. The now God wasn't
[1:27:51] vain.
[1:27:55] They give God glory for what he has done
[1:27:58] yesterday when he killed a thousand men.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; And they give God glory for what he's
[1:28:07] going to do.
[1:28:09] But Samson, where's the now God?
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:17] [Music]
[1:28:22] Samson
[1:28:24] replied
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; on a God of history.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; And it didn't help him a bit
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; to rely on a God of history.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; It won't help you a bit
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; for realizing last week you had an
[1:28:46] anointing on you. W.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; How does it look now?
[1:28:51] [Applause]
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; They said in the message
[1:29:09] circles
[1:29:12] we'll have a restoration of your glory.
[1:29:15] God.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; In other words, we'll go out again one
[1:29:18] more time and we'll show the world that
[1:29:22] that anointing is still with us. Amen.
[1:29:26] The people will dance. Amen. The
[1:29:28] pastor's wives will fall in the spirit.
[1:29:31] Amen. We'll show them again once more
[1:29:34] time that there'll be tongues. Uh we'll
[1:29:37] show them once more again that the
[1:29:40] will walk. We show them once
[1:29:43] again that angels will walk in the
[1:29:46] pillows and baptize the people with the
[1:29:50] Holy Spirit. We'll show them once again.
[1:29:55] [Applause]
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:59] [Applause]
[1:30:05] And when they went out to show us once
[1:30:08] again,
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; there was nothing.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; What was it?
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; A lost anointing.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; A lost anointing.
[1:30:23] [Applause]
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:37] Don't let us lose
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; what we had.
[1:30:43] [Applause]
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Young man, don't lose
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; that which you have.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Young golf, young sister,
[1:30:57] don't lose
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; what you have.
[1:31:02] [Applause]
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; They came to the end of 20 years and
[1:31:22] then only found out it's gone.
[1:31:27] Hallelujah.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Now they wake up.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; We'll go and get it again.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; It's just like Katie's beneer. When they
[1:31:35] got to Katie's beneer and they rejected
[1:31:37] it, they lost it. They gave it up. Amen.
[1:31:42] And the spies actually brainwashed them.
[1:31:46] They were better preachers than Joshua
[1:31:49] and Caleb. They preached the people
[1:31:51] under the table. They couldn't listen,
[1:31:54] amen, to God's voice in Joshua and
[1:31:58] Caleb. Because when a man of God speaks,
[1:32:01] that's the voice of God to them.
[1:32:05] [Applause]
[1:32:16] They couldn't even pick up
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; who's got the voice of God.
[1:32:21] So the anointing left them.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Man, Moses, we realize
[1:32:29] now we made a mistake. We realize now
[1:32:32] that there's something short here in the
[1:32:34] church. We realize we've got the Ten
[1:32:36] Commandments without the palire."
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; We'll go back
[1:32:45] and we're going to take the land again.
[1:32:47] And Moses says, "Don't go." Hallelujah.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Just God said we must go. He said no God
[1:32:53] is not with you.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; He rejected it.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; You lost the anointing.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Don't go.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; And they went back and they died like
[1:33:04] flies under the spray of doom.
[1:33:07] [Music]
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; One thing God hates when you reject the
[1:33:15] land and try to go get it back again.
[1:33:18] They hate you.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; It kills all of them.
[1:33:23] [Applause]
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Because it's the lost
[1:33:31] anointing.
[1:33:32] [Music]
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; There's nothing as sad
[1:33:36] as to see
[1:33:39] when a man lost his anointing. It was so
[1:33:42] sad to see the de J lost his anointing
[1:33:46] and he gave it over to his daughter. And
[1:33:51] how can a woman carry the anointing when
[1:33:54] God says she's not supposed to be in the
[1:33:57] boost
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:01] anointing?
[1:34:07] Then you find out after 20 years, my
[1:34:10] brother, after 20 years, they only found
[1:34:13] out
[1:34:15] that the glory of God has gone.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; It'sot.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Can you go on all the time
[1:34:25] and not pick up that the Holy Ghost is
[1:34:28] gone?
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:32] When the ark left
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Israel and it roamed around in the
[1:34:40] Philistines land and miracles happened
[1:34:43] in the Philistines land where gods fell
[1:34:48] to their faces in front of the ark.
[1:34:52] Israel still went on as if they've got
[1:34:54] it.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what's happening.
[1:35:02] And it's not going to happen here.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen here.
[1:35:08] [Applause]
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Father, hallelujah.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; That the deal gloria was gone.
[1:35:22] Though
[1:35:24] they come after they preached
[1:35:27] and they preached and they preach and
[1:35:31] they come to the end of the sermonate
[1:35:34] and they see there is no
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; glory
[1:35:39] and they try to sing songs to bring the
[1:35:43] glory and the glory still don't come
[1:35:46] they only become Pentecostals
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; when the glory is gone That's when they
[1:35:52] sang.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; I didn't know
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; though
[1:35:58] when they come to the end
[1:36:01] of the sermonet and they try to pump and
[1:36:05] pump and pump and pump. And when they
[1:36:07] finish pumped, there's no water flowing.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; It's dead.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; The glory of God has departed.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:19] Hallelujah.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; When they come to the end of that
[1:36:23] preaching
[1:36:24] and they beg the people, why don't you?
[1:36:27] Amen. Why didn't you say hallelujah?
[1:36:29] Clap your hands. Then the people clap
[1:36:32] their hands for 2 minutes and it's gone.
[1:36:34] There is no anointing. There's a noise
[1:36:37] with no anointing.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; There's a noise
[1:36:41] [Applause]
[1:36:43] with no spirit.
[1:36:47] [Applause]
[1:36:50] Hallelujah.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; It's the lost
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; anointing.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; The glory of God.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; You look at guys like Masam. They left
[1:37:09] here.
[1:37:11] Come visit their church.
[1:37:14] Come. They don't see
[1:37:17] if the glory of God did leave them.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:27] [Music]
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; And listen, they know it
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; because they already tasted it.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; They come from the place where they
[1:37:36] taste it.
[1:37:39] [Applause]
[1:37:50] Samson said,
[1:37:53] "I'll go out like other times."
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; But it's like brother Benham says, as I
[1:37:59] said,
[1:38:02] he relied
[1:38:04] on a God of history.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Yesterday, God.
[1:38:11] has done it.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Killed a thousand men
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; yesterday. He could tie 300 foxes tails
[1:38:21] together. Yesterday he could kill so
[1:38:25] many people that you can't count them
[1:38:28] yesterday.
[1:38:30] But Samson,
[1:38:32] can you kill a thousand today?
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:38] Hallelujah.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Samson,
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; that god of yesterday that killed a
[1:38:44] thousand.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Can it kill it today?
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Or is it the lost anointing
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; of a bunny
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; or the second story?
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Don't let anybody rob it from you.
[1:39:08] Don't let anybody rob this feeling. Get
[1:39:11] some pani from you.
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:15] [Applause]
[1:39:42] And when Samson lost
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; the anointing,
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; watch it. When Samson lost the
[1:39:50] anointing, the first thing he heard,
[1:39:54] Samson,
[1:39:56] the Philistines are upon you.
[1:39:59] Hallelujah.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; The minute you lose the anointing,
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; the Philistines are upon you.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Is the song on you?
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Have you trusted the song GMA more than
[1:40:16] Jesus?
[1:40:24] [Music]
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; So can't do nothing.
[1:40:28] He uses everything God does.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; He tells you to take the boat. Who made
[1:40:36] the boat?
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; He tells you, "Stand there. Let me throw
[1:40:41] the bones." Who made the bones?
[1:40:44] [Applause]
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; He told you to drink this mine. Who made
[1:40:53] the m
[1:40:59] [Music]
[1:41:01] Now I serve the god of the mut.
[1:41:04] What does God make?
[1:41:08] [Applause]
[1:41:09] [Music]
[1:41:12] [Applause]
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; You know why you go to a sangoma? It's
[1:41:28] because you've got a lost anointing.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; You need a fresh anointing. Hallelujah.
[1:41:38] [Music]
[1:41:38] [Applause]
[1:41:46] Hallelujah.
[1:41:53] [Music]
[1:41:53] [Applause]
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:04] [Applause]
[1:42:17] and
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; oh my
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; the first thing you
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Samson
[1:42:25] Samson
[1:42:27] Oh, Samson. Samson. The Philistines had
[1:42:31] upon you.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; How did they get in?
[1:42:37] How did the Somas get in here?
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; I tell you, you trust the Soma more than
[1:42:44] would you trust God. Why don't you
[1:42:46] strive to trust God the way you trusted
[1:42:49] the lying
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; dirty Soma?
[1:42:54] And maybe God can do something for us.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Bring back those happy days
[1:43:01] with a fresh anointing.
[1:43:06] [Applause]
[1:43:08] [Music]
[1:43:10] [Applause]
[1:43:16] Hallelujah.
[1:43:20] [Applause]
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; The pathetic part of it all,
[1:43:25] Joel. The pathetic part of it all.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; The worst part of it all. Who's cleaned
[1:43:32] that the Philistines have upon you?
[1:43:33] Who's cleaned that?
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; His own church. Jezebel.
[1:43:41] Jezebel told the pastor,
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; "The Philistines are upon you.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; The congregation is now telling the
[1:43:48] pastors,
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; you got no anointing.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Their own congregation,
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; their own churches
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; say there is no anointing in this
[1:44:01] church."
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:08] [Music]
[1:44:12] Since a young man I was worried
[1:44:15] I've read years ago when deceived church
[1:44:20] brother Brandham that's the the problem
[1:44:22] when you push and play you get all the
[1:44:24] things amen from the tape and on the
[1:44:28] tape brother Brandham cries out in
[1:44:30] deceive church
[1:44:32] he says banam tabernacle
[1:44:34] the Philistines are upon
[1:44:37] And I tried to find out the place where
[1:44:39] he retrieved that. He never fixed it up.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; And I wonder if it is still like that.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; I just wonder
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:44:55] what
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; as long
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; as this man is here.
[1:45:06] [Applause]
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:12] [Applause]
[1:45:15] Yeah.
[1:45:23] Heat.
[1:45:41] [Applause]
[1:45:48] I really don't care about your
[1:45:50] tradition.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; I don't care about the salute tradition.
[1:45:54] I don't care about the su tradition. I
[1:45:57] don't care about a perry tradition. I
[1:45:59] only have one tradition and that is thus
[1:46:03] saith the Lord.
[1:46:09] [Applause]
[1:46:11] Can you wave your Bibles to the Solomas?
[1:46:14] [Applause]
[1:46:20] Can you wave your Bible to the Somas?
[1:46:25] This is our tradition.
[1:46:30] [Applause]
[1:46:51] [Music]
[1:46:52] [Applause]
[1:46:55] I was laughing
[1:46:58] from Bkari. She's a dun
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; and a tun died
[1:47:04] and uh
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; her elders came to her and the elders
[1:47:09] says mkari
[1:47:11] rearing your two and tomorrow today you
[1:47:15] have to come with us down to the
[1:47:16] graveyard.
[1:47:18] She says for what? He says no you got to
[1:47:21] get into the grave.
[1:47:25] [Music]
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:29] And um
[1:47:31] she says, "And when I don't do it," she
[1:47:33] said is," they said, "Then you're going
[1:47:35] to die very, very soon. Maybe in a
[1:47:37] year's time." She said, "Well, I'm not
[1:47:40] going." And she didn't go. I asked her
[1:47:43] the other day, but I was 4 years now.
[1:47:46] The other day, I says, "Um,
[1:47:48] how long was your she said, Four years?"
[1:47:51] I said, "Now, what are you doing here?
[1:47:55] A bunch of liars.
[1:47:58] [Music]
[1:48:05] [Applause]
[1:48:09] There's a sister in Joelberg.
[1:48:12] There's a sister in Joelberg.
[1:48:14] She's in the church now. But before she
[1:48:17] was in the church, she she liked to go
[1:48:20] to Soma. Every little penny she has, she
[1:48:22] runs to the Soma.
[1:48:25] And she asked the sun about the job. So
[1:48:27] the sun said, "No, amen. Just kill a
[1:48:30] goat." A goat belongs to God, but he
[1:48:33] makes it as if it's his. And you take
[1:48:36] the skin and you tie it around your
[1:48:38] home.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Now the minute you put this, it's like
[1:48:42] handcuffs. You're cuffed with this one,
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; but you tie it up
[1:48:51] skin.
[1:48:53] Yes.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; And after she did that, she told me the
[1:48:59] says, "You'll never lose your job now."
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; I says, "Oh, yeah. Did he say that?"
[1:49:04] Yeah. She says, "So I'm secure. I'm
[1:49:06] losing my job forever."
[1:49:08] I came back 2 weeks after that. She's
[1:49:10] not there.
[1:49:13] I got a hold of her. I said, "Sister,
[1:49:16] I don't see you there at a job anymore."
[1:49:19] "No, I got fired." I said no.
[1:49:23] I lied.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; How can we listen to him?
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; That's a lost anointing.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; And Samson,
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; you can't even fool
[1:49:47] the young people anymore.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:50] Amen.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; On the internet.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; And then I ask another brother. He says,
[1:49:57] "No, you must pay laba, man. You must
[1:49:59] pay laba." I said, "Oh, yeah." I said,
[1:50:01] "Oh, no. You must pay, you know." So,
[1:50:04] you want the papi? Well, fine. You must
[1:50:06] pay. I said, "But dad, uh, have you
[1:50:09] finished your laba?" He said, "No, I
[1:50:12] still owe after 30 years."
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; What nonsense is that? You stole all
[1:50:18] Labola, but you want the guy to pay
[1:50:20] Labala.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; It's a bunch of nonsense. We only have
[1:50:25] one tradition.
[1:50:27] [Applause]
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, and Samson
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; lost the anointing. Hallelujah.
[1:50:52] when his hair grew back again
[1:50:57] for a fresh anointing
[1:51:01] in Judges 16:30,
[1:51:04] the Bible says, "So the dead
[1:51:09] which he slew
[1:51:11] at his death
[1:51:14] were more than they which he slew in his
[1:51:18] life.
[1:51:20] When the fresh anointing comes,
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; then you kill more Philistines in your
[1:51:25] life.
[1:51:30] [Applause]
[1:51:40] Oh my. When the locks close again,
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; when the seven thunder locks close
[1:51:47] again, then you only have one cry. You
[1:51:51] only have one prayer.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, let me die with my enemy.
[1:51:59] that fresh anointing comes, you're going
[1:52:02] to say, "Lord, is there any wicked way
[1:52:04] in me? Let me die.
[1:52:08] [Music]
[1:52:09] [Applause]
[1:52:27] Hallelujah.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, then you die.
[1:52:32] When the new revival comes and the fires
[1:52:34] are burning, then you die to false
[1:52:36] teachings.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; You die and you claim
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; because all the Philistines are dead in
[1:52:43] your life.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Don't you feel like that? Amen.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; A fresh alone.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Let
[1:52:58] it get away with
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Here's another thing that goes
[1:53:10] with the foolish virgins
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; that lost their anointing.
[1:53:17] Can I preach on
[1:53:22] [Applause]
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Judges 16:E 19
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; and this sounds like Matthew 25.
[1:53:39] It says, "And
[1:53:42] she, the church, Jezebel,
[1:53:47] made him,
[1:53:49] Samson,
[1:53:51] sleep upon her knees."
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; He fell asleep.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; On the knees of a deceived church.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:06] [Music]
[1:54:11] And the foolish virgins
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; fell asleep
[1:54:19] until
[1:54:21] Revelations 10 was made clear.
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; And it woke up the church once again
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; because he says the seven thunders wakes
[1:54:34] up the bride. Revelations 10
[1:54:38] wakes up the bride.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; We were sleeping
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; in the lamp
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; of Jezebel churches.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Pastors.
[1:54:55] Hallelujah.
[1:54:57] Sleep
[1:55:03] until she forgot
[1:55:06] to get full of the spirit.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Sleep
[1:55:11] until
[1:55:13] the enticing knees
[1:55:16] of the church.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; May the loser locks.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sleep church
[1:55:28] till the power of your Nazarite vow
[1:55:32] gets exploited
[1:55:35] by Jezebel.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Sweep
[1:55:42] until the Philistines
[1:55:44] creeps up suddenly and they don't know
[1:55:47] how the Somas came in.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. My my my
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; run.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Sleep
[1:55:59] until
[1:56:01] they bind you. Bind you with goat skins.
[1:56:06] Bind you
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; hand and foot
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; down at the ankles and here with goat
[1:56:14] skins.
[1:56:20] [Music]
[1:56:27] sleep
[1:56:31] until
[1:56:34] you grind
[1:56:38] in the prisons
[1:56:40] of false doctrine.
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:45] Sleep
[1:56:51] until
[1:56:54] the soul must eat your last
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; s.
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:57:02] Hallelujah.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Sleep on now.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Sleep
[1:57:11] until the tribulation get a hold of you.
[1:57:15] Yes, Lord.
[1:57:16] [Music]
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Sleep until you don't even hear the
[1:57:21] words of Matthew 25. Enter in
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; sleep on now soal bride in a message.
[1:57:33] [Applause]
[1:57:42] sleep until you grind
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; in the prison house
[1:57:49] and around
[1:57:51] and around
[1:57:53] and around
[1:57:55] and around and around false doctrine.
[1:57:59] He'll go the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:58:03] with no emotions. Around and around and
[1:58:08] around you go. The seven thunders is the
[1:58:11] seven virtues. False doctrine. And
[1:58:14] you're grinding trying to make it love.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; And you're going around and around and
[1:58:23] around and you go around. You visit this
[1:58:26] church
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; tomorrow. I hear you visit that church
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; around and around and around you go.
[1:58:36] Tomorrow I hear you preach in Tucson.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; The next day I hear you preach
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; on the robo park.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Around and around and around you go
[1:58:53] climbing.
[1:58:55] Hallelujah.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; To try and make your doctor love
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; around and around and around you go.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; And you know when a person go around and
[1:59:08] around, he don't go forward. He comes
[1:59:11] out to the same place.
[1:59:17] [Applause]
[1:59:24] Then you hear he's here. Then you hear
[1:59:27] he's there. Then you hear he believes
[1:59:29] this. Then you hear he believes that.
[1:59:31] And around and around they come.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Then you believe they inhale tabernacle.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Then you hear no. They broke away. They
[1:59:41] were Raymond Thompson. Amen. Then you
[1:59:44] hear he broke away there. He went to to
[1:59:48] then you hear he left there. He's now
[1:59:52] with death. Then you hear he left there.
[1:59:55] He's sitting at home. And around and
[1:59:58] around and around he goes.
[2:00:02] [Applause]
[2:00:02] [Music]
[2:00:03] [Applause]
[2:00:13] Young man, young girl, it doesn't help
[2:00:16] you to go around and around and try this
[2:00:20] and try that and see if drugs is good.
[2:00:25] See if kissing another boy is good.
[2:00:28] You're going around and around and
[2:00:31] around, but you're not moving forward.
[2:00:37] [Applause]
[2:00:45] And God got sick of it.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; And God got sick of it.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; God got sick of it
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; of going around and around around this
[2:00:57] mountain
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; because this is the mountain that
[2:01:01] brought the word.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:05] Amen.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; And God says
[2:01:08] enough.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; You're going around around around this
[2:01:13] mountain and the promised land is just a
[2:01:15] few days away where you can get the
[2:01:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost on
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; the word
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; the lost anointed.
[2:01:30] [Applause]
[2:01:31] [Music]
[2:01:37] For the latter killth and the spirit
[2:01:40] giveth a life. If the oil leaves,
[2:01:44] they bind you.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[2:01:48] the minute you lose the oil,
[2:01:51] you're going to be binded
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; by something.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Something is going to bind you.
[2:02:02] Hallelujah.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Because the devil make sure
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; that he's got you now because you don't
[2:02:09] have no power
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; to break the yoke.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; So it's easy to bind you.
[2:02:17] [Applause]
[2:02:29] If the oil fails,
[2:02:32] then you hear the cry, "The Philistines
[2:02:35] are upon you."
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; If the oiler leaves,
[2:02:43] they take out your eyes so that you
[2:02:46] don't see the revelation
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; of the token.
[2:02:54] [Applause]
[2:03:03] If the boy leaves,
[2:03:06] then hell has a taste.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; When Simpson lost his eyes, they were
[2:03:13] busting.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; They were having a party. They were
[2:03:17] glad. They got God's champion.
[2:03:22] That's when the oil leaves.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; If the oil leaves,
[2:03:32] there's only
[2:03:34] one prayer left.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; One prayer
[2:03:41] now. Lord, let me die with my enemies.
[2:03:44] It's the only prayer.
[2:03:47] When the oil leaves
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; closing,
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; what we need
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; is fresh oil
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; and a fresh anointing.
[2:03:59] [Music]
[2:04:08] [Applause]
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; I'm close.
[2:04:15] the lost anointing
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; because because
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; you struggle to worship
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; you have to be begged to clap your
[2:04:31] hands.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; What you need
[2:04:38] is a fresh anointing.
[2:04:43] [Applause]
[2:04:48] You struggle with a sex spirit.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; A problem with a sex spirit.

[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; You know what you need
[2:05:02] is a fresh anointing.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Please Lord,
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; your eyes get

[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; You can't overcome the things of the
[2:05:27] world.
[2:05:30] You know why?
[2:05:32] Because you need
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; a fresh anointing over

[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:06:03] You take the sun's advice
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; and tie goat skins
[2:06:10] on your wrist
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; and become a slave to them.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; It's time you know that the anointing on
[2:06:17] you is stronger than the anointing on
[2:06:19] that goal.
[2:06:21] [Applause]
[2:06:29] [Music]
[2:06:32] [Applause]
[2:06:37] [Music]
[2:06:39] You do what the sun says,
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; but you don't do what God says.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; We believe so much in a song.
[2:06:50] Now,
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; why don't you take that belief
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; and put it on Jesus Christ
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; and see
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; what the Lord can do.
[2:07:02] [Applause]
[2:07:13] You even drink
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; the mutyle
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; that you stole from God's roots and
[2:07:21] leaves to make the moody.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; You believe in the mi
[2:07:27] and the mi is not healing you,
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; but this moody
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; can heal you.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:40] [Applause]
[2:07:46] You spend your money on a soma
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; and you can't even pay your debt.
[2:07:53] [Music]
[2:08:03] [Applause]
[2:08:17] You spend your money
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; on clothes and eat out
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; but can't help in the needy box.
[2:08:27] You need a fresh anointing
[2:08:30] [Applause]
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; my sisters right around everything.
[2:08:40] Don't let your tongue be as long as your
[2:08:42] skirt.
[2:08:46] [Music]
[2:08:47] [Applause]
[2:09:03] I read some of the questions on the
[2:09:05] woman's day.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Our churches,
[2:09:10] our homes is a war zone
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; cuz these young brothers are so stingy.
[2:09:19] What do you do with your money?
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; If you had to serve the devil, you would
[2:09:24] have to take out his tithes to buy
[2:09:28] cigarettes.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; You have to take out his tithes
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; to buy some castle logo.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; You're going to take out his tides.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my god.
[2:09:50] to pay for DSTD.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; You're going to take out your tithes and
[2:09:59] give it to Ramaposa.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; He wants his tithes.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to God,
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; you don't give your tithes.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Some give their tithes to some soccer
[2:10:15] team.
[2:10:17] Some give their tithes to some sport.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; But you don't.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; You need a fresh anointing.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; I wonder if the resistance will come.
[2:10:42] The money in the bank
[2:10:45] is your god.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; You don't want to spend anything. So
[2:10:51] stingy you become.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; You can't even buy your wife underneath
[2:10:56] clothing.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; So stingy you are.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; You can't even buy your wife some
[2:11:02] toiletry.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; You need a fresh anointing.
[2:11:10] [Applause]
[2:11:24] You sit in the church and you know
[2:11:26] there's an evil thing in your heart
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; and yet you sin.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; You sit in dead churches that God left
[2:11:34] long ago but you still sit.
[2:11:37] It's the lost anointing.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; I know it's quiet here.
[2:11:45] [Applause]
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Are you going around and around and
[2:12:00] around?
[2:12:03] If you put anything in front of God,
[2:12:06] whether it's your sport,
[2:12:10] whether it's your family,
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; oh my,
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; is that your God
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; and not God? Yes, your God.
[2:12:20] Anything that you spend more time on,
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you,
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; behold your God.
[2:12:28] [Music]
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Will the musicians come?
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; I'm here to ask you,

[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; a fresh anointing?
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Sprinkle of oil.
[2:13:37] Fresh oil
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; from a fresh anointing.
[2:13:42] What?
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Are you going to go around and around
[2:13:45] and around
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; like the Wesleyan church,
[2:13:50] like the Lutheran church?
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Since Luther died, they're still in the
[2:13:54] same place.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; They're going around and around,
[2:13:58] [Music]
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; grinding
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; in the doctrines of yesterday.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; But Elan
[2:14:09] is an extra vessel here. Lord
[2:14:16] [Applause]
[2:14:19] [Music]
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; and I want to fool you
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; with some fresh oil.
[2:14:40] [Music]

[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; into Mopani and El Tabernacle
[2:14:54] around South Africa
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; for a fresh
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; anointing.
[2:15:01] [Music]
[2:15:06] We will come into this church
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; with thanksgiving
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; praising God.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I'll sing
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; the praises of Zion
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; in the midst of the church."
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; I want that fresh anointing.
[2:15:30] When you come into the church,
[2:15:32] you forget yourself.
[2:15:34] [Music]
[2:15:37] You forget who sits next to you.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; You forget what you've done yesterday.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; You forget your trials.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; You here to say, Lord,
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; A fresh anointing.
[2:15:57] [Music]
[2:16:00] [Applause]
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; If you feel that you're not
[2:16:06] a wife to your husband,
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; why don't you come and take
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; a cup full
[2:16:16] of fresh anointing.
[2:16:20] My brothers, if you feel
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; that you didn't treat your wife right,
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; why don't you come
[2:16:31] [Music]
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; for a cup
[2:16:34] of fresh anointing?
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; I assure you,
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; your cup will run over.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, my Lord.

[2:17:08] brother.

[2:17:16] [Music]
[2:17:18] And I believe
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; I can have
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; A fresh anointing.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Dad, will you pray for me? No, you pray
[2:17:34] for yourself.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not praying for you.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; You shout out to God.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:45] I can't hear you.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; I can't hear you.
[2:17:52] [Music]
