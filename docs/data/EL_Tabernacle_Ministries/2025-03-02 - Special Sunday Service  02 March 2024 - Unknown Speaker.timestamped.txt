[12:44] the golden altar which was Before the
[12:50] Throne there's an angel in E
[12:54] Tabernacle that takes our prayers
[13:01] and he mixes it with sweet smelling
[13:05] Savor so that when it comes to the altar
[13:08] it comes to the presence of God he
[13:11] cannot help but turn and he and look
[13:14] where that good smell comes from but
[13:17] it's all because of that angel of this
[13:23] SP and the smoke of the incense which
[13:26] came with the prayers of the Saints
[13:29] ascended up before God out of the
[13:31] Angel's
[13:34] hands and the angel took the
[13:39] scent and filled it with
[13:42] fire of the Altar and casted into the
[13:46] Earth and there were voices and
[13:48] thunderings and
[13:50] Lightnings and
[13:53] earthquake when this Angel comes in to
[13:58] [Music]
[13:59] your needs your
[14:02] desires the whole Earth and Heaven
[14:06] shakes at the same
[14:09] time may God add a
[14:12] blessing to the reading of his word
[14:17] [Music]
[14:22] hallelujah the 28th of
[14:25] [Music]
[14:27] February it was a happy
[14:30] visitation
[14:33] day the 28th of February was when the
[14:37] cloud
[14:39] appeared and in Revelations 10:1 it says
[14:43] I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[14:45] from heaven clothed with a
[14:49] cloud and here is that Mighty Angel
[14:53] clothed with a cloud his clothes is a
[14:56] cloud Hallelujah
[14:59] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[15:02] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[15:04] most high
[15:06] God and this
[15:09] [Music]
[15:10] was
[15:15] 2001 in maranata park where that angel
[15:18] was blowing the
[15:19] [Music]
[15:27] trumpet want to play you one
[15:30] clip
[15:35] [Music]
[15:54] Hallelujah God bless
[15:56] everyone I pray that you have a good day
[15:59] with God
[16:01] today brother brandham says when you
[16:04] want to get closer to God you pray and
[16:07] you read your
[16:09] Bible
[16:10] so where you were last
[16:13] week and this week it's two different
[16:17] levels that you can get so if you want
[16:19] to get more closer to God you're going
[16:22] to have to
[16:24] pray and remember what the Apostle
[16:27] said when you pray
[16:29] pray some part of you goes to the
[16:32] throne and God recognizes your voice and
[16:37] he says I know that voice that's my
[16:39] child speaking to me
[16:41] now and while you speaking he listens
[16:45] because you're part of
[16:47] him and by him recognizing your voice in
[16:51] prayer he will answer your prayer
[16:54] because he knows you are on the earth
[16:57] and you're going through a trial going
[16:59] through a hard time you
[17:01] are in a battle but he knows he's with
[17:04] you in the battle but he wants you to
[17:06] cry to him and when you cry out to him
[17:11] remember the answer is already on the
[17:13] way he
[17:15] says in the Millennium before you ask he
[17:18] will answer and it's already we are
[17:21] right there now that before we even ask
[17:24] God anything he already has worked out
[17:27] the answer because all things Works to
[17:30] together for the good to them that love
[17:33] the Lord so remember your prayer this
[17:36] Tuesday he's already answered but he
[17:38] wants you to ask so
[17:41] do the leadership and yourself of favor
[17:46] ask God today and then see if the answer
[17:50] comes and if the answer comes then you
[17:53] thank him for the rest of the week for
[17:56] answering your prayer cuz he's looking
[17:58] for an an excuse for you to talk to him
[18:02] he's every day looking for an excuse for
[18:05] you to meditate on him he's looking for
[18:08] an excuse to heal from you and you have
[18:11] a way to God's thrown by the
[18:13] representative on the earth so how come
[18:16] God cannot answer your prayer when he
[18:18] already sent somebody so that your
[18:20] prayers can be answered the Apostle
[18:22] praise you pray it's
[18:25] done Satan it's done
[18:29] House of hell it's
[18:31] done you just got to open your mouth buy
[18:36] your subconscious mind pray and God
[18:40] knows your voice God bless
[18:45] [Music]
[18:51] [Music]
[18:56] you spend time in the presence of God uh
[19:01] that man spends time with Jesus Christ
[19:05] that man hears from the Throne of God
[19:07] hallelujah he's under the unction and
[19:10] God wants more young men like that even
[19:13] if they said that you cannot pray he
[19:15] says I cannot pray that's my hour prayer
[19:18] no but the king said you I don't care
[19:21] what the king says I am going to pray
[19:24] Hallelujah young people God wants you to
[19:27] pray God wants you to
[19:31] [Music]
[19:32] [Applause]
[19:35] [Music]
[19:37] pray God bless
[19:40] you I just want to say this before we go
[19:44] into the prayer
[19:46] session just remember this that God's
[19:50] Apostle he moves in two Dimensions at
[19:53] the same
[19:55] [Music]
