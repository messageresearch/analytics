[1:08:13] we are surely pleased
[1:08:19] with King
[1:08:23] Lord Jesus
[1:08:30] for
[1:08:33] giving us the opportunity again
[1:08:37] to be here in London
[1:08:40] I came down years and years to Cape Town
[1:08:45] and I never dreamed
[1:08:47] that one day
[1:08:51] I'll be coming to langa
[1:09:03] and Jonathan told me
[1:09:08] that it's steadily growing
[1:09:13] a minimum of people about
[1:09:16] 16 that's without hermanus
[1:09:22] I am
[1:09:24] I'm pleased to God
[1:09:28] as I said week before last
[1:09:32] walls
[1:09:35] dedication
[1:09:38] I said I
[1:09:40] nail down a peg
[1:09:47] when everything seems to go wrong and
[1:09:50] all the lies that has been told
[1:09:53] and if
[1:09:55] made people believe those lies
[1:10:00] I hit down the pig
[1:10:06] and I look at that pig Wherever I Go
[1:10:11] that
[1:10:14] Prophet visits South Africa page 80.
[1:10:18] when I stood in front of brother barana
[1:10:21] [Applause]
[1:10:22] and he laid hands on me
[1:10:26] [Applause]
[1:10:30] now
[1:10:33] now there's no other minister in South
[1:10:35] Africa
[1:10:38] that can say that
[1:10:42] it's only me
[1:10:43] [Applause]
[1:10:50] and then I hit down another Pig
[1:10:54] as I told the ministers up in joburg
[1:10:58] it's when bully Paul wrote me a letter
[1:11:02] and told me brother Roscoe I don't
[1:11:04] listen to anybody
[1:11:06] just my father and you
[1:11:09] I hit down that page
[1:11:11] [Applause]
[1:11:20] then I hit down another page
[1:11:24] with brother higginson the head deacon
[1:11:27] or brother
[1:11:29] or Branham Tabernacle came and visit us
[1:11:32] with brother Brown
[1:11:34] and after the service
[1:11:40] I could speak to him but during the
[1:11:42] service he told the people
[1:11:44] he says the last time I felt the
[1:11:46] presence of God like this
[1:11:48] is when brother Branham preached
[1:11:51] on this day the scripture is fulfilled
[1:11:55] that was a loss I felt it
[1:11:58] until now
[1:12:10] [Applause]
[1:12:20] now who's going to stop me
[1:12:24] who's going to stop me
[1:12:26] Nigeria
[1:12:28] Ghana
[1:12:31] Zambia
[1:12:33] Cape Town
[1:12:35] can't stop me
[1:12:38] I'm ordained
[1:12:42] from a prophet
[1:12:51] [Applause]
[1:12:53] and all the positives all of them
[1:12:56] can't say what I'm saying now
[1:12:59] [Applause]
[1:13:04] so
[1:13:07] so I didn't come down here
[1:13:10] Taking Chances
[1:13:14] I don't take chances
[1:13:19] because I know who I am
[1:13:34] I come down to Cape Town
[1:13:38] many years and I
[1:13:42] and the people in London came in because
[1:13:44] of the tapes
[1:13:47] and that made me come down here
[1:13:58] I
[1:14:02] come down here just to pull out
[1:14:06] some seeds
[1:14:20] because Billy Paul told me
[1:14:23] he said brother Roscoe I deserved you
[1:14:27] and you got one of the best spirits of
[1:14:29] all the ministers
[1:14:35] he said to me
[1:14:39] he said to me he
[1:14:41] he gave me a gift
[1:14:44] after I told my dad
[1:14:47] don't go to Cape Town
[1:14:51] if the angel of God told you not to go
[1:14:54] to Cape Town
[1:14:56] then don't go
[1:14:58] and he said that please the angel
[1:15:03] to wake me up
[1:15:06] to see the angel
[1:15:14] so I do not know
[1:15:17] why the angel didn't want to come down
[1:15:19] to Cape Town
[1:15:21] I think it's because they rejected the
[1:15:23] Holy Ghost
[1:15:27] and bless him did
[1:15:30] so I'm just looking for someone
[1:15:34] that will go with me
[1:15:36] [Applause]
[1:15:37] to my father's house
[1:15:39] [Applause]
[1:15:49] so we are here not by chance
[1:15:53] we are here to come encourage the ones
[1:15:56] that's walking with us
[1:15:59] in Cape Town
[1:16:04] they will never have what you have never
[1:16:08] [Applause]
[1:16:20] on the oldest guy in the message now
[1:16:23] brother Beckett and them all came
[1:16:25] afterwards
[1:16:27] when brother Becca left joburg he didn't
[1:16:30] even preach he was not even a preacher I
[1:16:32] learned the preaching
[1:16:35] I was here teaching him
[1:16:40] so how can he teach me
[1:16:44] how can I learn from somebody that don't
[1:16:46] know as much as I know
[1:16:50] he doesn't know what I know
[1:16:57] and I'm getting old
[1:17:00] and I don't like nonsense anymore
[1:17:05] I don't play church or churchy
[1:17:08] and I do not play with people's Souls
[1:17:15] so
[1:17:19] I bring greetings
[1:17:22] to El Tabernacle Johannesburg
[1:17:26] Victoria
[1:17:31] storm
[1:17:33] he

[1:18:16] two Pentecostal Brothers two weeks ago
[1:18:19] pastors walked up to me
[1:18:21] I said brother Roscoe we're following
[1:18:23] you on a stream
[1:18:25] although we painted coastals
[1:18:28] but we silent Believers in here
[1:18:32] I greet you my brothers
[1:18:34] your Baptist is listening to me
[1:18:37] I greet you I look forward to one day
[1:18:41] share the Holy Ghost with you
[1:18:43] [Applause]
[1:18:52] and over in Vendor may God bless you
[1:18:56] as you streaming tonight
[1:19:00] and I hope that
[1:19:02] the streaming will just make you walk
[1:19:05] closer to God
[1:19:08] that's all that it's all about
[1:19:13] as I said
[1:19:16] the storehouse
[1:19:18] we'll try to put the details on
[1:19:21] for years that don't have the details
[1:19:24] to sign on
[1:19:26] we'll put it on after the service and
[1:19:28] tomorrow morning
[1:19:30] and uh
[1:19:32] we hope that all those tapes I preached
[1:19:35] over 3 000 tapes
[1:19:37] so this will never run dry
[1:19:41] [Applause]
[1:19:49] now bully Paul and Joseph Brennan
[1:19:53] can tell all the ministers to switch on
[1:19:56] and press and listen to the tape but
[1:19:59] they can't tell me that
[1:20:01] brother Graham says this boy will preach
[1:20:03] exactly what I preach
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:07] brother Branham says I must preach
[1:20:10] [Applause]
[1:20:16] and I can't listen to them I must listen
[1:20:18] to brother Brennan
[1:20:21] [Applause]
[1:20:26] so
[1:20:28] may you be blessed
[1:20:31] and the few families in the USA that's
[1:20:34] listening in
[1:20:36] may God
[1:20:39] just come your way
[1:20:41] to another
[1:20:43] as you listen to it
[1:20:47] this broadcast
[1:20:50] so let us preach I hope you're going to
[1:20:51] have patience with me tonight
[1:20:55] I must see how far we get I do not know
[1:20:58] I got comments to make before I preach
[1:21:03] and if you've got a pen and PayPal write
[1:21:06] down what I'm going to say
[1:21:07] go back home we're going to check it up
[1:21:10] don't go to your pastor because he's
[1:21:12] gonna lie to you
[1:21:14] go look it
[1:21:17] and they came unto the brook
[1:21:20] of s call
[1:21:24] Brokers where the water flows
[1:21:28] and cut down from cinch a bunch
[1:21:33] with one cluster of grapes
[1:21:38] they bit off
[1:21:42] a branch
[1:21:45] just with one cluster
[1:21:49] of grapes
[1:21:54] that was not the whole branch
[1:21:59] that was part of the branch
[1:22:03] that they broke off
[1:22:08] and the Bible says and they bear it
[1:22:10] between two upon a staff
[1:22:13] two guys
[1:22:15] had to carry
[1:22:17] that bunch of grapes
[1:22:21] it was so heavy one couldn't
[1:22:25] two had to
[1:22:28] carry The Grapes of the Promised Land
[1:22:34] God doesn't change
[1:22:47] and they brought off the pomegranates
[1:22:52] amen and of the figs
[1:22:56] three types of fruit
[1:22:59] in the Promised Land
[1:23:02] have your church got this fruit in
[1:23:05] their church have you got these fruit in
[1:23:07] your church
[1:23:18] I'd like to take another scripture
[1:23:22] I'd ask you to
[1:23:24] be patient with me right
[1:23:28] Galatians 5. now
[1:23:30] that's the fruit of the land and the
[1:23:33] land is the Holy Ghost
[1:23:38] now if your pastor preached on the Holy
[1:23:39] Ghost and that fruit is not in his
[1:23:41] ministry then he's lying to you
[1:23:45] then he is a Baptist trying to pull wool
[1:23:48] over your face
[1:23:50] if he hasn't got grapes in his ministry
[1:23:52] then he's not called
[1:24:03] Galatians 5.
[1:24:07] and verse 22
[1:24:10] but the Fruit of the Spirit
[1:24:13] let me say but the fruit of the land
[1:24:17] because the land is a spirit
[1:24:19] so the two scriptures goes together
[1:24:23] am I right
[1:24:27] is love joy
[1:24:29] now they say love love love love
[1:24:33] but love is only a fruit of the spirit
[1:24:36] the spirit don't come out of love love
[1:24:39] comes out of the spirit
[1:24:41] so get the spirit first because you say
[1:24:43] brotherly kindness brother
[1:24:46] don't come and tell Edgar Osco that
[1:24:48] because Edgar Osco want to see the holy
[1:24:50] ghost first then the fruit of the spirit
[1:24:53] love
[1:24:54] [Applause]
[1:25:00] otherwise he is not loved that man
[1:25:08] and out of love joy
[1:25:11] they love love love love love love
[1:25:14] but there isn't no joy in the church
[1:25:17] the pastor never danced around the
[1:25:19] pulpit yet
[1:25:21] but he speak about love and he's got no
[1:25:23] joy brother we have joy we have love and
[1:25:28] we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:33] [Applause]
[1:25:39] amen
[1:25:40] did you catch that
[1:25:44] I'd like to take Romans
[1:25:47] I didn't I didn't give this to you Edgar
[1:25:50] I just thought I'm gonna throw it in the
[1:25:52] air
[1:25:53] and
[1:25:55] read the scripture Romans 8.
[1:26:01] verse 23 first
[1:26:05] Romans 8 23.
[1:26:10] and not only then but ourselves also
[1:26:14] which what
[1:26:19] now what is the first fruit of the
[1:26:21] spirit
[1:26:22] love
[1:26:25] the Bible don't contradict itself
[1:26:27] then why is the pastors contradict
[1:26:30] themselves why does Bible Tabernacle
[1:26:33] lie like that
[1:26:39] let's take another one eight
[1:26:41] same Romans 8 I think verse 9.
[1:26:47] focus on
[1:26:50] this is already too much
[1:26:54] but you are not in the flesh but in the
[1:26:57] spirit
[1:26:59] it's so be that the spirit of God dwells
[1:27:02] in you
[1:27:04] not if any man have not the spirit of
[1:27:08] Christ
[1:27:09] he is none of his
[1:27:14] you don't even belong to Jesus even if
[1:27:17] you in Bible Tabernacle if you don't
[1:27:20] have the spirit you're none of his he's
[1:27:22] going to say turn around
[1:27:24] I know you not
[1:27:28] and they never had the Holy Ghost in
[1:27:32] Bible Tabernacle they never had an
[1:27:35] outpouring in Bible Tabernacle they
[1:27:40] never had a dance
[1:27:42] in Bible Tabernacle
[1:27:48] [Applause]
[1:27:51] that pasta never danced Hallelujah can
[1:27:55] you imagine brother Becca dance
[1:27:58] [Applause]
[1:27:59] but I saw brother Brennan dance
[1:28:01] [Applause]
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:12] that's why longer
[1:28:14] stay where you are
[1:28:17] stay where you are
[1:28:18] [Applause]
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:30] I think
[1:28:31] and the only one that can correct back
[1:28:34] it
[1:28:37] but he can't correct me amen
[1:28:40] I can show you where he's wrong
[1:28:43] let me tell you this just this before
[1:28:46] you said
[1:28:47] we went Florida and Bob Browns Church
[1:28:52] and brother Beckett only preached porber
[1:28:54] holiday
[1:28:56] like he now recently just preached
[1:28:58] van diyao
[1:29:01] and sing with dry
[1:29:04] Baptist Methodist songs
[1:29:08] that's why please give me a monster
[1:29:21] [Applause]
[1:29:26] and it was so dead in that church
[1:29:29] after Beckett preached brother Becca
[1:29:32] preached
[1:29:33] we went to the hotel
[1:29:36] and brother Becker threw himself on the
[1:29:38] bed
[1:29:40] he says you know brother Roscoe
[1:29:43] my church is dead
[1:29:45] but this church is deader I said Angel
[1:29:50] just write down what he says now
[1:29:51] [Applause]
[1:29:53] this word catch him
[1:29:55] just after he died
[1:29:58] just after he died that will come to him
[1:30:01] out of his own mouth
[1:30:04] his church is dead
[1:30:06] I went same thing happened church is
[1:30:09] dead
[1:30:10] he went on the Sunday morning
[1:30:12] was was he fell asleep
[1:30:17] I went in
[1:30:19] the evening
[1:30:22] and I made them laugh I made them
[1:30:28] I made them loose
[1:30:30] [Applause]
[1:30:34] and when Bob Brown's church was loose
[1:30:36] you know you sat right in front here
[1:30:38] every time you finish preaching don't
[1:30:40] close the meeting you don't say nothing
[1:30:42] what you preach you just turn around to
[1:30:44] the people and say you dismiss
[1:30:47] that was Beckett's right-hand guy that
[1:30:49] that was brother Beckett's Colonel of a
[1:30:52] guy I said I look at brother back and I
[1:30:54] said no what is this
[1:30:57] people with hats on
[1:31:00] but Beckett will go after that nonsense
[1:31:04] and thus is recorded in heaven
[1:31:08] and when I was finished
[1:31:10] and they were laughing and they were
[1:31:12] free
[1:31:13] I put in the Holy Ghost there
[1:31:15] [Applause]
[1:31:28] Hallelujah
[1:31:29] [Applause]
[1:31:37] so can brother Becca tell me anything
[1:31:40] out of his own multi-cities church is
[1:31:43] dead
[1:31:47] nobody can tell me anything
[1:31:50] I was here before they were again
[1:31:57] okay that's enough of that
[1:32:01] if I should entitle this a message
[1:32:03] tonight
[1:32:04] or to tell entitle it
[1:32:08] the fruit of the land
[1:32:11] the fruit
[1:32:13] of the land
[1:32:17] I have never heard anybody preach
[1:32:20] on the fruit of the land
[1:32:25] the pomegranates
[1:32:28] the honey
[1:32:31] the figs
[1:32:34] and the grapes
[1:32:36] all speaks about the Holy Ghost
[1:32:38] [Applause]
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:44] he told Israel when you get in the land
[1:32:47] that's what you're going to get
[1:32:50] amen
[1:32:52] let's buy our heads
[1:32:54] father
[1:32:57] I've traveled a thousand miles or
[1:32:59] kilometers down here
[1:33:03] not to waste any time
[1:33:07] but to be glad to be able to work for
[1:33:10] you
[1:33:11] and not doing you a service
[1:33:14] but do everything
[1:33:16] that I do
[1:33:18] to show back into the Bible
[1:33:23] [Applause]
[1:33:25] may you a father
[1:33:28] look at the heart
[1:33:31] and please
[1:33:34] give us something to think about
[1:33:38] I ask it in Jesus name amen
[1:33:41] you may be seated
[1:33:43] [Applause]
[1:33:45] now as I said
[1:33:48] I've never heard anybody preach on the
[1:33:50] fruit
[1:33:52] of the land
[1:33:55] because the land's got fruit
[1:33:58] and he told them it's got fruit
[1:34:01] and we want to check that fruit up
[1:34:04] but before going in there
[1:34:06] I just got something to say
[1:34:09] before I start preaching
[1:34:13] I'd like to take Point number one
[1:34:17] and
[1:34:20] now let's see how many has discernment
[1:34:24] discernment is to be able to
[1:34:28] discern between two things right and
[1:34:30] wrong

[1:34:34] or foolish virgin
[1:34:36] God
[1:34:38] or not God
[1:34:40] see if you got discernment
[1:34:42] quote
[1:34:44] but manifested quote
[1:34:46] it's good to quote
[1:34:48] but he said quote manifested in your
[1:34:50] church
[1:34:53] so I want to see
[1:34:55] as this gets streamed out
[1:34:58] who's got discernment
[1:35:00] where is the discernment
[1:35:03] it's to match up two things
[1:35:07] the right thing and the wrong thing
[1:35:10] so just for a couple of minutes
[1:35:13] let's see if Cape Town has discernment
[1:35:17] are they taking what their pastor says
[1:35:19] or what brother Branham says
[1:35:22] are they taking just a quote and not a
[1:35:25] manifested quote
[1:35:28] amen
[1:35:29] if you have your paint pins and papers
[1:35:31] to it right around the world
[1:35:33] I would like you to write down these
[1:35:36] quotes
[1:35:37] the first one
[1:35:40] is
[1:35:42] the middle is festered manifestation
[1:35:46] of thy Resurrection
[1:35:50] to the people of this day
[1:35:53] listen to that
[1:35:55] brother Brahm says there
[1:35:57] I can hear a noise
[1:36:01] a noise
[1:36:04] do you hear a noise in the churches
[1:36:09] in the message
[1:36:11] in Cape Town
[1:36:13] but brother Brown says I hear a noise
[1:36:18] I can imagine the poor blind beggar said
[1:36:23] it's this noise all about
[1:36:25] why does el Tabernacle make a noise
[1:36:30] what is this noise all about
[1:36:32] [Applause]
[1:36:36] [Music]
[1:36:36] [Applause]
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:39] [Applause]
[1:36:42] now listen
[1:36:46] you know he tells us you know
[1:36:50] well I'm in Bible temp I'm in that
[1:36:52] Temple I'm in that type of and and I'm
[1:36:56] in you know
[1:36:57] but he tells you do you know
[1:37:00] that say that you're in the message
[1:37:03] you know usually where Jesus is
[1:37:07] there was always a little noise
[1:37:11] [Applause]
[1:37:33] foreign
[1:37:36] [Applause]
[1:37:47] it upsets the Baptist
[1:37:51] because brother Beckett comes from the
[1:37:52] Baptist
[1:37:55] um it always upsets the Baptist
[1:37:58] if there's a noise
[1:38:00] and I heard they said the last time I
[1:38:02] was here you can't you can't shout all
[1:38:05] the time who tell you you can't why do
[1:38:07] the cherubims shout day and night all
[1:38:12] the time
[1:38:13] [Applause]
[1:38:16] get behind me Satan
[1:38:27] [Applause]
[1:38:31] it's a little upsetting
[1:38:34] they get upset
[1:38:36] the Baptist in the message
[1:38:38] they get upset
[1:38:40] and you know for 57 years that I'm in
[1:38:42] the message they got upset
[1:38:45] but you think they could change me I had
[1:38:48] a pet down

[1:39:32] a lot life comes in
[1:39:36] life what
[1:39:41] what brings a noise
[1:39:43] and you say you got life
[1:39:46] and there's no noise you're a liar
[1:39:49] because brother Branham says life brings
[1:39:54] a noise
[1:39:55] [Applause]
[1:40:04] foreign
[1:40:06] [Music]
[1:40:07] [Applause]

[1:41:05] you're going to hell
[1:41:07] one word
[1:41:09] with all the Nigerians and whatever it
[1:41:12] is in your church you're going to hell
[1:41:17] miss this quote
[1:41:20] now when I like to say this
[1:41:24] I said discernment
[1:41:27] between the right and wrong now if you
[1:41:29] take the opposite
[1:41:30] of this good he says where there's a
[1:41:32] noise there's Jesus
[1:41:35] Jesus is there where there's a noise
[1:41:38] now the opposite
[1:41:40] if there is no noise
[1:41:43] is Jesus there
[1:41:45] [Applause]
[1:41:52] [Music]
[1:41:55] do you believe the prophet
[1:41:58] do you believe this quote

[2:08:10] fulfilling it they don't have it they
[2:08:13] can't do this because they're not the
[2:08:16] real Church
[2:08:17] that's why I like this one

[2:09:57] carried the grapes
[2:10:00] amen the real fightful Ministry carried
[2:10:03] the grapes
[2:10:17] why should
[2:10:20] God
[2:10:22] let the real preachers come with grapes
[2:10:27] you make wine from grapes
[2:10:29] so the land is full of wine
[2:10:32] so God don't want any sober people
[2:10:37] he wants strong people
[2:10:39] he says in my land Allah

[2:11:29] Becca is a dry preacher
[2:11:35] maybe he saved me
[2:11:38] just to tell you
[2:11:40] could this be the reason why the angel
[2:11:41] didn't want to brought brother Abraham
[2:11:43] to come to Cape Town
[2:11:44] they rejected the grapes
[2:11:49] the bishop rejected the grapes

[2:22:20] said the last one day okay let's go
[2:22:25] it's only my commands
[2:22:27] the sign of unbelief
[2:22:30] when God gave Solomon a great gift of
[2:22:33] discernment and all Israel rallied
[2:22:35] around it oh wouldn't it be a great day
[2:22:38] today if all the churches would rally
[2:22:41] around God's great gift the Holy Spirit
[2:22:49] would you not be wonderful if we just
[2:22:51] forget our differences and denominations
[2:22:54] and just realize rally around the
[2:22:59] greatest gift
[2:23:00] that God gave
[2:23:03] ever sent to the Earth the Holy Spirit
[2:23:08] his son died that he might come
[2:23:12] could you read the other one
[2:23:22] the holy spirit is greater
[2:23:27] and the Bible
[2:23:31] and Hugo on the prophet says the prophet
[2:23:33] said the prophet said the prophet says
[2:23:35] the Holy Ghost is greater than what the
[2:23:37] prophet said
[2:23:39] because the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible
[2:23:41] [Applause]
[2:23:49] it says you speak one word against
[2:23:52] he says you can speak against the word
[2:23:56] it will be forgiven him
[2:23:59] but speak against the Holy Ghost
[2:24:01] it will never be forgiven here
[2:24:04] [Music]
[2:24:06] by Christ came the spirit when they
[2:24:09] called him Balsam up he said you say
[2:24:10] that against me the son of man
[2:24:12] they quote the scripture I'll forgive
[2:24:14] you but when the Holy Ghost has come and
[2:24:17] does the same thing one word against it
[2:24:19] will never be forgotten forgiven in this
[2:24:23] world not the word to come
[2:24:24] and George Martin calls
[2:24:27] falling in the spirit they fall like
[2:24:29] monkeys
[2:24:32] when they dance they dance like Michael
[2:24:34] Jackson
[2:24:36] one word
[2:24:38] I don't care what you're saying
[2:24:40] the invoice
[2:24:43] it's goodbye
[2:24:45] No Redemption
[2:24:47] and how many words did that two guys
[2:24:48] speak against the Holy Ghost
[2:24:56] the minute they die
[2:25:01] they have to face this
[2:25:04] for what they said
[2:25:06] against the Holy Ghost
[2:25:11] it's one word against it will never be
[2:25:14] forgiven in this world not the world to
[2:25:16] come
[2:25:17] and this is a greater day than that was
[2:25:23] just a day now
[2:25:24] when God has poured out his spirit
[2:25:27] from Johannesburg right down to Cape
[2:25:30] Town right overseas it's a greater gift
[2:25:34] amen giving out the Holy Ghost over 40
[2:25:37] countries people is under the spirit
[2:25:40] it's a greater day this day when he
[2:25:45] poured out his Spirit according to Joel
[2:25:48] 2 and I'll pour out my spirit at All
[2:25:50] Flesh it's a greater day than when
[2:25:52] brother pranam was here amen because the
[2:25:55] Holy Ghost has gone right around the
[2:25:58] world Amen and baptizing people amen the
[2:26:02] way brother Branham says the Holy Ghost
[2:26:04] is jumping and shouting and emotions

[2:26:18] his church universally 40 countries

[2:26:41] one there's another one
[2:26:43] yep
[2:26:46] the Seal of God
[2:26:48] that's the way God does when he he sends
[2:26:51] his power
[2:26:52] down with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:26:55] and he moved in right there and Away
[2:26:58] went the message
[2:27:00] Hallelujah and they shouted and screamed
[2:27:05] you mean when the message went down
[2:27:07] they shouted and screamed
[2:27:13] and spoke in tongues and went out there
[2:27:17] and that was the mark that God put upon
[2:27:19] the people that was the mark
[2:27:22] shouting and screaming that was the mark
[2:27:25] that God put on the people
[2:27:30] did he put it on you
