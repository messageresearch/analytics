[applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a time we had last night. [applause and cheering] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; I want to thank brother Stefford and Abigail, my daughter, &gt;&gt; for raring men of God. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And now they could plant back into the church. [applause] &gt;&gt; All the years of turmoil and struggle, &gt;&gt; sweat, &gt;&gt; and tears &gt;&gt; and labor. &gt;&gt; It's worth sitting &gt;&gt; under something like that. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; We surely we surely &gt;&gt; proud of you young guys. [applause] &gt;&gt; God sent you in here to push the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; I would also start where my grandson started. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Same quotation. [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; We don't have it on that one. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. I want the world to see it. Can we read it? &gt;&gt; Can we read it? &gt;&gt; And so &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I hope that his voice auth Even I [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] love you. [applause] [cheering] There there has never been anything like that in the Bible. &gt;&gt; There's never been anything like that &gt;&gt; in the end time message. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; So, it's so good &gt;&gt; to be able to &gt;&gt; not only quote Bible &gt;&gt; but to manifest &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; We could even say brother Burnham didn't have the opportunity And uh this weekend you didn't only come to a service, &gt;&gt; you come to this day. &gt;&gt; The scripture [cheering and applause] is to [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; But what's happening now is far more greater than this quote. [applause] &gt;&gt; Why? [applause] Why? Because Jesus says a son &gt;&gt; and a grandson and a grandfather, &gt;&gt; but I got two sons and I've got two grandsons. So it's bigger than this. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; I have already preached with my sons and grandsons. But I just felt in my spirit, &gt;&gt; I like to preach with my grandsons. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; And it's far more greater than President Mandela. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; There's something more greater than President Mandela [cheering] because he's got no sons that can follow him. I have and not a kingdom of South Africa, the kingdom of heaven. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; So we come to manifest &gt;&gt; that scripture. &gt;&gt; Such a lot of scriptures has been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Makes sense to the word is fulfilled. The token bearer &gt;&gt; is fulfilled. [cheering] &gt;&gt; One that has the dynamics. It's &gt;&gt; fulfilled. Another Ephesians is here fulfilled. [cheering] Turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal faith. It's from F. [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Somebody will come one day &gt;&gt; and blaz evolution [cheering] fulfall [applause and cheering] will come. It's fulfilled. [cheering and applause] [applause] [cheering] A little boy will come and preach exactly like the prophet. Same message. [cheering] It's fulfilled. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:8. It's fulfilled. [cheering] Revelations 10:37 thunders uttered their voices [cheering] fulfilled. Matthew 25 fulfilled [cheering] [applause] the gospel trumpet fulfilled. [cheering] You sit in a church that fulfills scriptures. [cheering] [cheering] Heat. [applause] [cheering] Heat. [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; we together again &gt;&gt; and when we together &gt;&gt; then hell shakes. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; We give out eternal life &gt;&gt; to men &gt;&gt; that got nearly 200 years in prison. &gt;&gt; We gave them eternal life. The year turn [cheering] &gt;&gt; fulfilled. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham [applause] got one prisoner off the hook &gt;&gt; and they gave him a medallion or something for it. El Tabernacle. We can't even count that. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] [applause] And &gt;&gt; just before going into the sermon, &gt;&gt; we have at last &gt;&gt; broke the backl of the Durban church. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; So yet again, [applause] there's another church that's gone up. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; We were just speaking of the guys that gave towards this church, Brother Eddie Muhammad and them. &gt;&gt; And yet here it stands. And the blessings, Brother Eddie, is not going to end. &gt;&gt; Look at it now. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; So I greet you &gt;&gt; my friends. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Good evening friends. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] [cheering and applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I'm happy to be with you again. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Last night when Joe finished preach and nearly simultaneously me and Jonathan told him, "Um, him and his brother Joel, man, if we get a little more older, &gt;&gt; don't put us out of your church, okay?" Amen. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; So don't put me out of this church. [applause] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't go. &gt;&gt; You can't get rid of me. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; So I greet all of you. I wish we could have been under one roof. I see where it's full next door. And the tent is also full. &gt;&gt; And uh but uh as long as you a couple of feet from the anointing, &gt;&gt; you will still feel &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Now tonight we have a mixed crowd and I have to cater for a mixed crowd. I have to also preach ABCs around &gt;&gt; the band here &gt;&gt; and uh um to reach everybody and um therefore I'd like to go to what I'm busy with &gt;&gt; Matthew 25 If your Bibles with you, [applause] &gt;&gt; we turn to Matthew 25. &gt;&gt; Just one verse. Matthew 25 verse two. [crying] And five of them were wise and five were foolish. Half of the church &gt;&gt; was foolish. And I'm not going to speak about the wise. &gt;&gt; I want to speak on the foolish church. &gt;&gt; The foolish church. It's quite strange that God &gt;&gt; will put two churches &gt;&gt; right in the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; right at the time &gt;&gt; when Messiah comes. &gt;&gt; Right at that time &gt;&gt; where Trump put up taxes to tax the people. &gt;&gt; As Herod tax the people, &gt;&gt; they had to go to Bethlehem where Jesus had to be born because of taxes. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; The first coming taxes &gt;&gt; and now &gt;&gt; taxes again. at the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So there'll be two churches right &gt;&gt; today. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; There'll be a wise church &gt;&gt; and there'll be a foolish church. &gt;&gt; And you have to think &gt;&gt; in which church you are in &gt;&gt; tonight. [applause and cheering] The El Tabernacle is a foolish church. And I want to tell you, you better get out &gt;&gt; and go look where there is &gt;&gt; a wise church &gt;&gt; where the scriptures are being fulfilled. [applause] And if you're from any other church, may you sit here in this meeting tonight and may you do some calculations in your mind &gt;&gt; and ask yourself the question, &gt;&gt; do I belong to a foolish church &gt;&gt; or do I belong to &gt;&gt; a wise church? [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; We want to find that out tonight. [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, so ironic, &gt;&gt; nobody actually spoke on this, &gt;&gt; but the king himself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No disciples spoke on this. &gt;&gt; No scribe, &gt;&gt; no Pharisee, &gt;&gt; but the Lord himself. [applause] [cheering] [applause] And he tells us &gt;&gt; in that time, &gt;&gt; open your eyes, &gt;&gt; there's going to be two churches, [applause] &gt;&gt; one foolish church, and one wise church. &gt;&gt; And you will have to fight through it all. It's not easy to get into the wise church. [cheering] &gt;&gt; It is a battle. It is a revelation. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And the king says in Matthew 25, &gt;&gt; he said, "Just before I come, &gt;&gt; and I hope if you're in El Tabernacle &gt;&gt; that you're not foolish. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now why is she foolish? &gt;&gt; Why is this church foolish? Webster dictionary says a fool is somebody &gt;&gt; lacking understanding &gt;&gt; can't understand &gt;&gt; why this people &gt;&gt; going like a bunch of mad [cheering] heresy worshippers can't understand. [cheering] [cheering] A fool is somebody &gt;&gt; that lacks judgment &gt;&gt; or choosing. &gt;&gt; They can't judge properly.
