[38:28] Jesus Christ I would like to greet the
[38:31] founder the Visionary leader of Al
[38:33] Tabernacle Christian College our Apostle
[38:36] Edgar Hill
[38:42] Rosco his sons Pastor Jonathan and
[38:45] Pastor Jude sister Abby and the Rosco
[38:48] family at large I am truly honored to be
[38:52] standing before you at this momentous
[38:54] ceremony the 20th anniversity of the
[38:57] best school in the
[39:03] world it's amazing how the two years
[39:06] given to us by the critics has spanned
[39:09] to become 20 years I have been
[39:11] privileged to be called to be what they
[39:14] call furniture of the school my mom says
[39:17] I literally begged to be at the school
[39:19] at the tender age of three thank God I
[39:21] was already party today and Glenn thank
[39:25] God if someone had told me that I would
[39:28] be standing here as an alarmist 20 years
[39:30] later I wouldn't believe you I can still
[39:33] see madal staring as she lowers her
[39:36] glasses and glares into your soul to say
[39:39] perform Jay or he brother Glenn laughing
[39:42] in assembly at to his own jokes my arms
[39:45] still remember the burn as M Teddy
[39:47] drilled us arms up sideways down just to
[39:51] get our attention or the weight in my B
[39:54] in my the weight of the bell in in my
[39:56] hand as I was the designated Val ringer
[40:00] this was way before the bleding sidon of
[40:03] brother Owen's horn was imprinted in my
[40:05] mind I can't forget the assemblies when
[40:08] we'd sing Story and run around the
[40:10] sanctuary the days we spend playing
[40:13] church church or open Gates on the grass
[40:16] or when we'd spot that car driving into
[40:18] the rco parking time Stood Still as we
[40:21] flocked to the driver's side door just
[40:24] to feel the warm embrace when the
[40:26] apostle would hug you I'm just reminded
[40:28] of the first award ceremony okay being a
[40:31] 4-year-old girl I was very young so this
[40:34] was too long the ceremony took way too
[40:36] long but I still remember M Sheila
[40:38] waking me up taking me by the hand and
[40:41] walking with me to the podium as I
[40:43] collected the first and only most
[40:45] popular award it was a good memory in my
[40:48] life I can go on reeling about the
[40:50] wonderful times I've had in this place
[40:53] but nothing can ever compare to the
[40:55] moments spent in in the presence of the
[40:57] Lord whether it be on a Tuesday during
[40:59] break when we would come into the
[41:01] sanctuary to pray or Friday morning when
[41:04] the minister would preach or morning
[41:06] assemblies when a tape would be played
[41:08] or the simple Act of reminiscing on the
[41:10] Sunday or the combined preaching the
[41:12] angel of the lord always graced us with
[41:14] his presence You Never Know What You've
[41:17] Got Till It's Gone I can truly attest to
[41:20] this whenever you having a bad day or
[41:23] feeling distressed if you would just
[41:25] knock on Heaven's Door he would answer
[41:27] you would walk in the hallways you would
[41:29] feel the presence of the Lord or you'd
[41:31] even bump into the Apostle or his sons
[41:33] and you just feel better while walking
[41:35] in the passages I just want to thank God
[41:38] for sending his servant our way for
[41:40] giving him a vision and the Zeal to see
[41:43] it through to fruition I personally
[41:45] don't know where or what I would be if
[41:47] it were not for these walls the safe
[41:50] haven against the evil World a place
[41:52] that not only nurtured us and fed us
[41:55] naturally but spirit spiritually the
[41:57] school hasn't only produced doctors
[41:59] accountants engineers and lawyers but it
[42:02] produced learned individuals who know
[42:04] who God is and where he can be
[42:10] [Applause]
[42:13] found I want each and every one of us to
[42:16] take a look around every brick every
[42:19] pillar every window and every door if
[42:23] you don't believe in the Supernatural
[42:25] you are sitting in a miracle that took 9
[42:27] years I mean 9 months 9 months people to
[42:31] materialize when he laid the first four
[42:34] bricks appointing Michael Gabriel rapael
[42:37] and urel I believe that the Apostle made
[42:41] provision for everything that has
[42:42] transpired in these 20 years thank you
[42:45] Lord for sending your gift our way thank
[42:48] you Apostle for a vision that saw us
[42:51] through and thank you to the Rosco
[42:54] family that gave their father to us

[43:01] the way he should go and when he is old
[43:03] he will not depart from it thank you
[43:06] Lord for a place that taught us how to

[43:39] accountant can we welcome Jolene
[43:44] [Applause]
[43:55] ludik
[43:59] so I may be from the first class but uh
[44:02] I will say that I keep up with the time
[44:05] so excuse me as I just log in
[44:09] prudy um it's such an honor and a
[44:12] privilege to be here um I must say as I
[44:16] walked in I couldn't help but remember
[44:19] that first day brother Glenn and the
[44:21] small wall at the back there and it just
[44:23] became so real for me um it is an
[44:26] incredible honor and a blessing and a
[44:29] privilege to stand here and speak a
[44:33] little bit about the school and the
[44:35] impact that the school has had on my
[44:39] life so I just firstly want to start by
[44:43] acknowledging the man of
[44:45] God I I think that it goes without
[44:49] saying when you see a man's fruits and
[44:53] his works you cannot doubt
[44:56] that God is with him
[45:03] and I I couldn't help but
[45:08] remember I think it was in Petoria and
[45:11] prudy alluded to this when the Apostle
[45:14] actually announced his vision for this
[45:18] church and the school came with that
[45:21] Vision as well and I remember the
[45:24] Apostle saying that this school will
[45:27] become one of the greatest Outreach
[45:30] mechan mechanisms of the ministry and
[45:33] you know today as I sit here and I think
[45:36] and I look at the faces that sit before
[45:38] me and the ones who have sat in the
[45:41] seats that you now occupy so many Souls
[45:44] that have come through this ministry we
[45:47] can't but thank God for a gift in this
[45:51] [Music]
[45:54] ministry and the and I think it would be
[45:56] a great miss if I do not acknowledge our
[46:01] leadership Pastor Jonathan Pastor Jude
[46:04] Sister Abigail the rosow
[46:10] [Applause]
[46:13] family I remember even sister Sheila the
[46:17] first day and when I came into the
[46:20] ministry I was still a young Christian a
[46:22] very young Christian uh when I came into
[46:25] the school and theila was so
[46:28] instrumental in helping me understand a
[46:31] lot of things and I just want to
[46:33] acknowledge her as
[46:41] well and then I think to just end off my
[46:45] introduction I'd like to just appreciate
[46:49] the teachers of e Tabernacle brother
[46:52] Glenn brother Owen all of the teachers
[46:55] each each
[46:57] one I think that you are handpicked you
[47:01] are chosen of God to cross paths with so
[47:04] many lives and make a difference you may
[47:08] never know the impact that you have um
[47:11] in our lives and I think each of us can
[47:14] attest to a special moment that we share
[47:17] and we carry that with us it's it's
[47:20] those Eternal moments that carry us when
[47:22] we don't feel like we can carry on so
[47:26] thank you to you may God bless you in
[47:28] your efforts as you support the man of
[47:30] God and as you continue this great
[47:34] work so I've been called upon to speak a
[47:38] little bit about the school and uh that
[47:42] includes me as well brother
[47:45] Glenn I when I started I remember with
[47:49] the open
[47:50] day I was very determined to um be in a
[47:55] good good school and overambitious um
[47:59] always wanting to be in a space that I
[48:02] know I'll be able to do well and do my
[48:04] best so because of that and not knowing
[48:08] much about the school it was the first
[48:11] year my mom had arranged for me to have
[48:14] a one-on-one with brother Glenn and uh I
[48:18] I asked brother Glenn I remember sitting
[48:20] in that back classroom brother Glenn you
[48:22] may not remember but I
[48:24] do and I sat down very serious face and
[48:28] I said brother Glenn I just want to make
[48:31] sure you know that this is the right
[48:33] place for me you know and I'm going into
[48:36] matrick and this is an important year
[48:39] and I really just want you to give me
[48:41] that
[48:43] assurance and you know brother Glenn uh
[48:48] gave me that expression which I think
[48:50] many of you can relate to it's a change
[48:54] in the face and it's it goes very
[48:56] serious and you know he you know so I
[49:00] came asking him that and he just turned
[49:02] around and he became very serious and he
[49:05] said to
[49:06] me my
[49:07] sister this is the best place the best
[49:11] school in the world and I have no doubt
[49:15] that you are not going to make a mistake
[49:18] to be in yel
[49:21] Tabernacle and I just took that and I
[49:24] accepted and I walked away and I said
[49:25] you know what um I'm going to give it my
[49:28] all and starting from day one my heart
[49:31] was overjoyed I was like bursting out of
[49:35] my seams because I was so excited to be
[49:39] in a place where I could be surrounded
[49:42] with brothers and sisters of like
[49:44] Precious Faith coming from a a outside
[49:49] school I I just want to give you the
[49:51] short testimony to the young children
[49:54] and Learners City here
[49:56] today um attending an outside school
[49:59] with the dress code a long uniform I
[50:03] remember countless times brother du
[50:05] coming to my home and trying to
[50:07] encourage me to stand despite whatever
[50:11] the obstacle
[50:13] was and those things kept me but when I
[50:16] walked in here it was like home and it
[50:19] wasn't like home I was home and I just
[50:23] want to say to you that the time that
[50:25] you spend here is so critical I have
[50:29] only had the opportunity to be here for
[50:31] one
[50:32] year but I must tell you that this one
[50:35] year was enough to change my life
[50:38] forever I could never be the same after
[50:46] that and I think if I were to just cross
[50:50] over and speak about the school we know
[50:52] that you know the fundamental pillars of
[50:55] the school is to fly with both Wings
[50:58] spiritual and
[51:00] academic and what makes the school so
[51:04] successful and so great and so unique is
[51:08] the spiritual
[51:10] element as I mentioned before I was
[51:12] really young when I joined the school
[51:15] and I needed a lot of help and when I
[51:19] joined the school the thing that always
[51:22] captivated me was the baptism of the
[51:24] Holy Ghost
[51:26] and I'll let you in on a little secret
[51:28] here I know my brother is here you'll
[51:30] probably laugh but just before we join
[51:33] the ministry I um we attended a
[51:36] Pentecostal church and I was so
[51:39] desperate for the holy ghost that I was
[51:42] saying to them you know I really want to
[51:43] change I really want to live right and
[51:46] by then we weren't in the
[51:48] ministry and the the minister is going
[51:51] and he's pushing and uh I was so
[51:54] desperate and then he says raise your
[51:57] hands you know and people start like
[51:59] falling you know in the spirit and then
[52:02] I didn't know the Holy Ghost and I also
[52:04] thought you know what this is the way so
[52:07] I just threw myself on the floor you
[52:09] know like also acting and my brother he
[52:12] was standing next to me with two stoter
[52:14] so um he looked at me and he kicked me
[52:17] saying Joe what are you doing get up you
[52:20] know and um so when I came here I could
[52:26] freely experience the Holy Ghost you
[52:29] know the one thing that I really wanted
[52:31] was that and God afforded me that
[52:34] [Applause]
[52:39] opportunity and I think some of the
[52:42] experiences that I just want to share
[52:43] with you is you know coming out of
[52:47] sister chenel's classroom the classroom
[52:49] was right on the top here on a Tuesday
[52:52] I'll never forget we were fasting and
[52:54] praying
[52:55] and I looked out firstly in the morning
[52:58] the apostle was right here
[53:01] um actually kneeling at the EHR
[53:05] minia and he prayed saints that whole
[53:11] day and the anointing that filled this
[53:15] place I remember being so fascinated
[53:18] and I'm sorry but even as I think about
[53:22] it it's it really touches my my heart
[53:26] and I stood at that window and I looked
[53:31] down and I remember saying God as the
[53:35] man of God sits and lays before you may
[53:38] you place him on my heart on his
[53:41] heart and the Apostle continued to pray
[53:45] that entire
[53:47] day to witness something like
[53:50] that is beyond words it's beyond AC IC
[53:55] achievement it is
[53:57] beyond anything your mind can ever
[54:02] comprehend
[54:03] and I remember thinking that what kind
[54:07] of a man is this that he will sacrifice
[54:10] everything he has for us and because of
[54:14] that I always said God help me that I
[54:16] will keep the hands and arms of the man
[54:19] of God
[54:24] up
[54:27] [Applause]
[54:29] I also remember many times um sitting in
[54:33] the classroom and the Holy Ghost will
[54:34] just pour
[54:37] out it was lifechanging to say the
[54:41] least and for many reasons we can praise
[54:46] the
[54:46] school but I don't think there is a
[54:49] single amount of words that or accolades
[54:54] that that can come remotely close to the
[54:58] impact that the Holy Ghost has on our
[55:02] lives I also just you know in my
[55:07] day-to-day experiences here at the
[55:10] school I think we were privileged to see
[55:12] one another grow brother Glenn um we
[55:15] grew we made
[55:17] mistakes um you know as I stand here and
[55:19] look at the youngsters we made many
[55:23] mistakes but there there was one thing
[55:25] that
[55:26] really resonated with me and it's
[55:29] something I took from the
[55:31] Apostle it's the perseverance I spoke
[55:33] about this brother Glenn you reminded me
[55:35] at my matrick bank with such a simple
[55:39] principle perseverance
[55:42] diligence um Pastor Jonathan once said
[55:45] to me that
[55:47] diligence is the drive to wake up every
[55:50] day and Chase your vision own your
[55:54] destiny
[55:56] and I always kept that with me no matter
[55:59] what and as I begin to speak about
[56:03] academics and corporate you know uh path
[56:07] I really want you to remember
[56:10] that if God could do it for me he can do
[56:13] it for
[56:15] anyone
[56:18] and
[56:20] I I remember when the school just after
[56:24] we met articulated uh the Apostle called
[56:27] us and he wanted us to say what we were
[56:31] going to
[56:32] study and this again I mean you ask
[56:36] yourself on the face of this Earth what
[56:39] kind of school is consistently checking
[56:42] into this day on where their Learners
[56:45] are what they doing and I remember the
[56:48] Apostle um asking each of us we were
[56:51] only nine in
[56:53] matrick and I had U mentioned I wanted
[56:56] to go into
[56:58] education and I remember the Apostle's
[57:00] face he didn't say anything but he just
[57:04] looked at me and something in me told me
[57:08] that I that's not what God called me to
[57:11] do and I went with my passion and
[57:15] thankfully brother Glenn happened to
[57:17] have walked that road before me and so
[57:20] not knowing anything about accounting
[57:22] guys and that's why I want you to if
[57:25] anything take away that in this ministry
[57:30] The Impossible is possible it is
[57:37] possible so as I I matriculated I asked
[57:41] brother Glenn um advice I actually
[57:44] registered for the wrong degree and
[57:46] brother Glenn said to me no Joe you you
[57:49] need to change your degree which I did
[57:52] and I want to thank you brother Glen
[57:55] and I went on to study part-time and I
[57:59] was working and studying which is really
[58:03] hard um the values that the school
[58:06] instilled in us as Learners to work hard
[58:10] to persevere and to never give up and I
[58:14] say this with a reason because it took
[58:16] me 12 years to qualify as a chartered
[58:19] accountant and I woke up every day um
[58:23] and I wrote it on my Bridge uh when I
[58:26] got married one of the first things I
[58:28] wrote I really would I want to be a
[58:31] chartered accountant and at that time it
[58:34] was such a big dream for me in my head
[58:36] in my ability it was very
[58:39] impossible but I am so thankful that
[58:42] throughout my journey I was privileged
[58:44] enough to have the Apostle Pastor
[58:46] Jonathan the leadership of this church
[58:48] and specifically Pastor Jonathan very
[58:51] instrumental in guiding me throughout
[58:54] the journey journey and the gift in this
[58:57] ministry is beyond measure
[59:00] sense I hit the roadblock where I
[59:04] couldn't pass one subject and it was
[59:07] really difficult I told myself this is
[59:09] it I'm giving up and I remember saying
[59:13] to pastor jnan this is it I'm not I
[59:15] can't this is I can't go further than
[59:19] this Believers Pastor Jonathan actually
[59:22] said to me why are you answering a
[59:24] question like this this is how you must
[59:27] answer
[59:28] it and believe it or don't believe it
[59:32] it's my experience it's my testimony and
[59:36] you won't believe it saints that was the
[59:38] exact method to that subject I I did not
[59:44] do something
[59:45] [Music]
[59:51] else so to be found in a place where you
[59:55] are surrounded by God men men of God
[1:00:00] that are ordained and that have our best
[1:00:03] interest at heart is the greatest
[1:00:05] blessing I could ever asked for and I
[1:00:08] want to close by saying that yes I may
[1:00:12] have attained the ca I may have attained
[1:00:15] I attained my goal but I've also been
[1:00:18] taught don't be
[1:00:21] satisfied and so as I continue my
[1:00:24] journey journey I hope to
[1:00:26] inspire the young mind sit standing and
[1:00:29] sitting before me here and
[1:00:32] say and leave you actually with these
[1:00:37] words Pastor Jonathan once also said
[1:00:40] that um the more
[1:00:42] salt you get the thirstier you become
[1:00:47] and the more you
[1:00:50] drink and the salt are those challenges
[1:00:54] it's way when you are most weak when you
[1:00:56] can't see your way
[1:00:58] out Pastor Johnson says that's the time
[1:01:01] when you need to actually use that to
[1:01:04] own your
[1:01:05] destiny so I really want to encourage
[1:01:09] you and say today as I stand
[1:01:12] Here I Am the general manager of finance
[1:01:17] Global for a big multinational uh Health
[1:01:21] um equipment and devices company
[1:01:25] and I don't say this for my
[1:01:28] Accolade I only say this to show the
[1:01:31] power of this
[1:01:33] ministry the power of the vision of the
[1:01:36] man of
[1:01:37] [Applause]
[1:01:40] God and I want to close with this
[1:01:45] phrase Pastor Jude said in when he
[1:01:48] preached Miracles he said you have two
[1:01:51] choices you have a choice in life life
[1:01:54] where you choose to say that there are
[1:01:58] no
[1:01:59] Miracles and the other way is to say
[1:02:03] that every day is a
[1:02:11] miracle and for me today is a
[1:02:14] miracle it will always be the first day
[1:02:17] I stood at that war brother Glen was a
[1:02:19] miracle in my life and it will always
[1:02:23] be
[1:02:24] and we know also that time gives you
[1:02:28] things it's also something that Pastor
[1:02:31] Jonathan always says time gives you
[1:02:32] things and as we reflect on the 20 years
[1:02:34] I thought about it this morning brother
[1:02:36] Glenn God gave the school many many
[1:02:39] blessings many many blessings but may it
[1:02:43] not stop here may God continue to bless
[1:02:46] you bless the school bless the Learners
[1:02:49] bless our leadership and I just want to
[1:02:52] say thank you to my Apostle I want I
[1:02:54] want to salute you and I want to thank
[1:02:56] you with everything within me thank
[1:03:01] [Applause]

[1:07:02] so zealous for God
[1:07:05] Apostle as we look through this 20 years
[1:07:08] of Al Tabernacle Christian College we
[1:07:11] can truly say your loving was not in
[1:07:16] vain what you truly stand for an embody
[1:07:21] is found in the core and the foundation
[1:07:25] of the school never have I been with the
[1:07:28] Apostle and God is Not on his lips never
[1:07:32] have I spoken to the Apostle without
[1:07:35] wisdom stepping to the Forefront so this
[1:07:39] morning when you look at the
[1:07:41] school you know the foundation of the
[1:07:44] man that built
[1:07:48] it it was not only to educate but to
[1:07:53] save
[1:07:54] it was not built to empower only but to
[1:07:58] protect it was not only there to create
[1:08:02] professionals but to create Holy Ghost
[1:08:04] filled professionals the heart of the
[1:08:07] school is Holiness Holiness unto God so
[1:08:13] let's just take this time to salute
[1:08:16] God's Apostle for
[1:08:18] creating a god- centered environment
[1:08:22] where our children can thrive in the
[1:08:25] Holy Ghost Apostle we salute you this
[1:08:29] [Applause]
[1:08:33] morning
[1:08:35] [Applause]
[1:08:39] amen so this morning I was tasked to
[1:08:43] just give a brief synopsis of the
[1:08:45] school's
[1:08:46] history on this momentous
[1:08:49] occasion celebrating two years two de
[1:08:53] Decades of unwavering dedication and a
[1:08:57] Relentless pursuit of Excellence let me
[1:09:00] take you on a journey that began in
[1:09:04] 2005 defying the naysayers and the
[1:09:08] Skeptics who D to question our very
[1:09:12] existence the naysayers said the school
[1:09:15] will only last a year maybe two at most
[1:09:20] but Al Tabernacle it's 20 years to today
[1:09:24] by the grace of God the school is still
[1:09:28] standing
[1:09:30] amen while other pastors were playing
[1:09:34] the fool Apostle Rosco was building a
[1:09:39] school in the face of
[1:09:41] uncertainty Apostle Edgar Hil Rosco's
[1:09:44] Vision birthed not just the school but a
[1:09:48] testament to the miraculous power of
[1:09:51] faith and vision from the the decision
[1:09:54] to start grade R to 12 simultaneously in
[1:09:59] 2005 to the groundbreaking achievements
[1:10:02] of our first grade 12 class of 05
[1:10:05] securing 100% pass rate Al Tabernacle
[1:10:09] set the stage for a legacy of Triumph
[1:10:14] Against All Odds a paradox the school
[1:10:19] achieved numerous 100% Pass rates in
[1:10:21] grade 12 multiple distinctions and
[1:10:25] Bachelor passes throughout the 20 years
[1:10:28] I've also been so privileged to count
[1:10:30] myself amongst the L Tabernacle alumni I
[1:10:34] started in grade one in
[1:10:37] 2005 and so happens that my grade one
[1:10:41] teacher is here today amen and I
[1:10:44] matriculated teacher IRA and I
[1:10:47] matriculated in
[1:10:48] 2016 and like I heard prudy
[1:10:52] said you only realize something when
[1:10:55] it's gone amen and I must say you
[1:10:58] realize the impact of the school once
[1:11:01] you walk out those doors you just feel
[1:11:04] and know you cut from a different piece
[1:11:07] of cloth
[1:11:12] amen and that leaves an indelible Mark
[1:11:16] in your life that can't be
[1:11:19] erased in 2016 we embrac the future with
[1:11:23] open arms ushering in a digital era of
[1:11:26] teaching and learning the introduction
[1:11:28] of tablets not only revolutionized
[1:11:31] education but became our Lifeline during
[1:11:34] the unprecedented challenge of

[1:12:17] spirit of Al Tabernacle is imprinted in
[1:12:20] each and every success story
[1:12:27] amen yet beyond the academic accolades
[1:12:32] our journey is etched with divine
[1:12:36] intervention the spiritual front of Al
[1:12:39] Tabernacle is
[1:12:40] unparalleled across the 20
[1:12:43] years over a thousand Learners baptized

[1:13:08] quote the school helped many Learners in
[1:13:11] their spiritual walk one just needs to
[1:13:14] listen to the ex pupils testifying
[1:13:17] proudly about the AL Tabernacle
[1:13:19] Christian College Heritage to scratch

[1:13:34] Tabernacle Christian College done in our
[1:13:37] spiritual walk in the ground tapestry of

[1:13:43] achievements of this institution stands
[1:13:46] as The Pinacle of what the school stands

[1:30:18] years ago is a
[1:30:20] miracle then to have the church in this
[1:30:24] building is also a
[1:30:26] miracle and then to have the
[1:30:29] visioner of this great building and this
[1:30:32] church is a
[1:30:37] miracle and to
[1:30:40] have a school around this
[1:30:44] building just the brick work alone is a
[1:30:48] miracle that had to be built
[1:30:53] and then to build a school in the
[1:30:55] building there two different
[1:30:58] aspects is also a
[1:31:02] miracle and then to still have it

[1:31:08] greater
[1:31:09] [Music]
[1:31:14] Maro I
[1:31:17] um must say that during the time of Co
[1:31:23] we really went through a hard patch with
[1:31:25] the
[1:31:27] school and the man of God never wavered
[1:31:31] or said
[1:31:32] anything we thought we're going to hit a
[1:31:35] bad spot but we survived
[1:31:39] Co we survived low student
[1:31:44] turnout and right now we sitting here in
[1:31:48] this
[1:31:50] Tabernacle with the opening
[1:31:52] of the
[1:31:53] school which is a supernatural school
[1:31:56] there's lot of
[1:31:58] schools but to have a supernatural one
[1:32:02] it's an honor to see it with your
[1:32:06] eyes this is a miracle Upon A Miracle on

[1:32:16] realized you can leave the
[1:32:19] school you can finish your career you
[1:32:22] can leave the
[1:32:24] school but the school won't leave
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:32:33] you it's a school
[1:32:35] of academic
[1:32:38] achievements and the spiritual
[1:32:40] achievements cannot be compared to
[1:32:43] anything that you know or that anybody
[1:32:47] knows we want to thank the teachers that
[1:32:50] has been here for 20
[1:32:52] years I just want to give them they also

[1:33:08] a I saw brother
[1:33:11] Glenn very emotional to see his ex-
[1:33:14] students but he's not supposed to focus
[1:33:16] on the ex
[1:33:18] students he must focus on the current
[1:33:20] students at
[1:33:24] because what we did for them we have to
[1:33:26] do for these that has come amen and even
[1:33:29] more

[1:33:48] something and then we'll go on because
[1:33:51] we can be here the whole day and still
[1:33:53] not get to the bottom of it all
[1:33:57] amen um the Book of Genesis
[1:34:04] 28 I want you to remember that
[1:34:09] December was a great
[1:34:12] convention the Apostle preached a very
[1:34:14] great sermon here for the two
[1:34:18] meetings but then I realized
[1:34:22] that the church was before the
[1:34:24] school so that 20th convention we had
[1:34:29] here with what the Apostle preached made
[1:34:31] I have a
[1:34:33] jubilee as Al Tabernacle not the school
[1:34:36] just Al
[1:34:37] Tabernacle 20 years in this building was
[1:34:41] also a great miracle today is the follow
[1:34:45] on of their 20
[1:34:48] years I don't know if you with me this
[1:34:51] morning
[1:34:52] oh it looks like you forgot that there
[1:34:54] was a convention and you forgot what was
[1:34:56] preached there was nothing ever preached
[1:34:59] like what was
[1:35:01] preached at our 20th
[1:35:09] year and I thank God that I was here to
[1:35:13] hear
[1:35:16] it and you were here to hear
[1:35:20] it
[1:35:22] now the scripture I'm reading is just in
[1:35:26] light of what
[1:35:28] we are seeing here Genesis 2811 and he
[1:35:34] lightened
[1:35:36] upon a certain
[1:35:40] place so there's lot of places but there
[1:35:43] is a certain place and I want you to
[1:35:47] know and tell the one next to you this
[1:35:49] is a certain
[1:35:54] place it's not any
[1:35:57] place it's a
[1:36:00] certain
[1:36:02] place L Tabernacle is not any place you
[1:36:07] bringing your child to the school it's
[1:36:10] not any place it's a certain
[1:36:15] place it's a put out Place ordained by
[1:36:20] God
[1:36:21] so we are standing in a certain
[1:36:26] place you didn't come here by accident
[1:36:29] God brought you to a certain place this
[1:36:35] building was built because it's a
[1:36:37] special
[1:36:39] place there is no other place like this
[1:36:43] certain place called Al
[1:36:46] tacle you are standing in a certain
[1:36:50] place
[1:36:51] out of all the places you know this is
[1:36:55] the certain place it is even better than
[1:36:58] the house you live
[1:37:00] in this is a certain
[1:37:03] place this place is ordained of God for

[1:38:28] our resting place we made this place a
[1:38:32] place where we say I'll rather be a

[1:55:48] God
[1:55:52] [Music]
[1:55:59] we
[1:56:00] um greet
[1:56:04] you in his wonderful
[1:56:08] name I need to apologize
[1:56:12] I I see everybody's got Ties on and suit
[1:56:18] on
[1:56:21] and and the founder of this Bolding in
[1:56:24] this
[1:56:26] organism you know looks like
[1:56:30] this but I've got the colors
[1:56:33] [Music]
[1:56:40] [Applause]
[1:56:41] on so
[1:56:44] um I thought we just going to sit
[1:56:48] around and and
[1:56:52] um and
[1:56:58] celebrate it cannot be rubbed
[1:57:04] out it cannot be
[1:57:07] brushed underneath the
[1:57:13] table neither can it be
[1:57:18] ridiculed
[1:57:20] that
[1:57:21] this could have only been
[1:57:25] [Music]
[1:57:27] [Applause]
[1:57:33] God
[1:57:36] for a black man like
[1:57:40] me to have had a
[1:57:43] vision like
[1:57:47] this is unheard heard
[1:57:53] of a vision that don't end
[1:57:57] here a vision that's
[1:58:02] growing as the
[1:58:05] years flies
[1:58:09] by it'll go into
[1:58:12] [Music]
[1:58:14] eternity because there people that
[1:58:18] decided young people that come to this
[1:58:20] school that has
[1:58:25] decided that they're not going to
[1:58:28] die the death of an
[1:58:35] unrighteous that
[1:58:39] Vision has gone far beyond the
[1:58:45] grave to the other
[1:58:47] side of the Ring
[1:58:54] where the king of
[1:58:57] glory is waiting for
[1:59:00] them
[1:59:03] therefore we didn't have a vision like
[1:59:05] Mandela
[1:59:07] had for the put South
[1:59:11] Africa South Africa that's been cursed
[1:59:15] by the
[1:59:17] Jews and the curse is short
[1:59:20] coming you'll hear tonight what I have
[1:59:24] to
[1:59:25] say I'll rather be a
[1:59:29] Zimbabwean now than to be a South
[1:59:33] African because a curse is thrown over
[1:59:37] us whosoever
[1:59:39] curs
[1:59:41] Israel God
[1:59:45] said they will be cursed amen
[1:59:50] so your vision is
[1:59:53] not for a
[1:59:56] struggle I mean we've been in the
[1:59:59] struggle I've been in the
[2:00:02] struggle and we thought that the ANC is
[2:00:06] going to take the struggle
[2:00:08] away but I'm in a worse struggle now
[2:00:11] than when I ever was
[2:00:14] before I'm still
[2:00:18] struggling
[2:00:21] therefore these
[2:00:25] kids hasn't had a vision of
[2:00:28] thec and
[2:00:30] Mandela they have a vision of
[2:00:33] [Applause]
[2:00:43] Jesus we are not
[2:00:46] Muslims and we're not Jewish
[2:00:51] we don't follow mammad to
[2:00:55] Muhammad and we don't follow
[2:00:58] Moses we follow the greatest
[2:01:01] man that ever
[2:01:04] lived and his name is
[2:01:14] Jesus and that's what we bow the school
[2:01:17] on yes sir
[2:01:19] and that's what we're going to fight
[2:01:21] for and that's why we're going to
[2:01:26] stand for the time we have down
[2:01:30] here might not be very
[2:01:34] long
[2:01:37] so I'm sorry that
[2:01:40] I I look like
[2:01:46] this
[2:01:48] casual
[2:01:49] and
[2:01:52] uh but it's not the clothes that makes
[2:01:55] you
[2:01:57] something what in
[2:02:01] [Applause]
[2:02:08] here so may God Rich you bless
[2:02:12] you you know there's nothing you can do
[2:02:14] against
[2:02:16] fruit I don't have to say anything
[2:02:20] yeah I mean it's been
[2:02:23] displayed what this is all
[2:02:27] [Applause]
[2:02:34] about you don't have to guess what fruit
[2:02:37] is
[2:02:40] here you can see
[2:02:42] it with your own
[2:02:45] eyes you want to know who somebody is
[2:02:50] if you want to know who somebody is
[2:02:53] don't look on how popular he is and all
[2:02:55] that look at his
[2:02:58] [Applause]
[2:03:07] fruit if he steals money and
[2:03:10] bankrupt a
[2:03:13] country then what fruit did he bring he
[2:03:17] stole and fruit is stealing and sto
[2:03:25] stealing
[2:03:27] so our
[2:03:30] fruit will carry
[2:03:33] on I'm so
[2:03:35] happy when I saw the
[2:03:41] ex great
[2:03:44] 12 a whole
[2:03:47] church
[2:03:52] do you know a much
[2:03:54] [Applause]
[2:03:57] that act grade 12 as doctors and lawyers
[2:04:05] and just what you saw
[2:04:08] yeah and you want to tell me that's not
[2:04:11] fruit the school
[2:04:14] has
[2:04:16] proven
[2:04:17] itself
[2:04:24] and that's only the natural
[2:04:27] side the spiritual side over
[2:04:31] the the Christmas weekend at our
[2:04:34] convention was the greatest time I
[2:04:38] had for my 57th years of serving
[2:04:42] God in a
[2:04:45] Ministry that God could give me the keys
[2:04:48] Stone
[2:04:52] Revelation in the spiritual
[2:04:59] realm there has never been messages
[2:05:05] preached like what was
[2:05:07] preached over that
[2:05:11] [Applause]
[2:05:13] weekend we could clearly and honestly
[2:05:17] say and I I make no bones about it
[2:05:21] because I think my job is done
[2:05:25] yes
[2:05:30] that we have angels in
[2:05:36] [Applause]
[2:05:43] attendance and for the people that had
[2:05:46] trusted me when I opened the school
[2:05:52] some of your children is here and they
[2:05:54] have children now you saw them up
[2:05:57] here they were children but now they
[2:05:59] mothers and they they fathers they got
[2:06:07] children your
[2:06:11] investment has come to the for
[2:06:14] today to show
[2:06:17] you the money you
[2:06:20] spent it's not worth one of these
[2:06:25] Souls that was on the spit
[2:06:27] [Applause]
[2:06:36] for
[2:06:40] so it is one of the greatest
[2:06:44] things that could ever
[2:06:47] happen
[2:06:50] in South
[2:06:55] [Applause]
[2:07:01] Africa so I just got a few comments to
[2:07:04] make and uh I don't have to talk you
[2:07:07] know talk becomes very cheap when you
[2:07:09] see things like
[2:07:11] this because the fruit overwhelms
[2:07:15] it the proof of the pudding is in the
[2:07:18] eating
[2:07:24] I only realize
[2:07:28] after many
[2:07:31] years what a school
[2:07:37] entails the
[2:07:40] beginning of a
[2:07:42] plant or a
[2:07:45] seed in the hearts of a child
[2:07:49] to prepare him for the
[2:07:55] future the beginning is the school where
[2:07:58] you
[2:08:00] plant that
[2:08:03] seed and that seed is actually
[2:08:07] there for the
[2:08:09] future of that
[2:08:12] child what that child is going to be in
[2:08:14] the
[2:08:16] future you planted it right
[2:08:20] here the mothers and the fathers only
[2:08:22] have a couple of hours with a
[2:08:25] child but the
[2:08:27] teachers is there all the time with a
[2:08:32] child
[2:08:35] planting
[2:08:38] sees either of
[2:08:41] discrepancy
[2:08:42] or seeds of
[2:08:47] Eternity
[2:08:49] we made it
[2:08:52] sure that you're not going to have an
[2:08:56] educated
[2:08:59] sinner well
[2:09:01] educated but morals
[2:09:05] gone we made
[2:09:08] sure that they're going to be
[2:09:12] educated but they will have
[2:09:15] models that no other school will
[2:09:19] [Applause]
[2:09:24] have we make
[2:09:27] sure that what we
[2:09:30] planted we won't be sorry
[2:09:33] tomorrow when we see the fruit
[2:09:36] coming standing here after 20
[2:09:39] years I planted that seed way back there
[2:09:44] with the teachers that was with
[2:09:46] us and after 20 h I can stand right here
[2:09:50] now and see the
[2:09:52] fruit that that seed is
[2:09:56] producing amen and here they are the
[2:09:59] husband and the wife come from the
[2:10:02] school and they are married and they
[2:10:04] brought for children and that children
[2:10:07] that they brought forth will be exactly
[2:10:10] the way they are because the seed don't
[2:10:13] change if it's a apple it's a apple if
[2:10:15] it's a pear it's a pear it's a bring
[2:10:18] forth after its kind and these little
[2:10:21] guys here has seen today what God has
[2:10:25] planted 20 years ago May that seed go
[2:10:30] into them and they do the same thing and
[2:10:34] become the same fruit of that very very
[2:10:39] teaching of the
[2:10:42] [Applause]
[2:10:47] teachers
[2:10:51] I wouldn't
[2:10:54] topel the fight that we
[2:10:57] had because in intimity I was going to
[2:11:00] read two
[2:11:01] verse
[2:11:05] 15 study to show thyself a proof and
[2:11:09] that's what we told them
[2:11:12] study
[2:11:14] study and here we had on the platform
[2:11:18] people that took that little
[2:11:20] bit they
[2:11:22] studied to show themselves approv today
[2:11:26] they can take out their
[2:11:28] certificates and say I'm this and I'm
[2:11:32] that and I'm that why they studied to
[2:11:35] show
[2:11:36] them themselves approved right here
[2:11:40] today in front of your eyes I am this
[2:11:44] now and I am that now and I am that now
[2:11:47] they are
[2:11:49] proven
[2:11:50] testimonies of the seed that we
[2:11:54] [Applause]
[2:11:56] [Music]
[2:12:00] [Applause]
[2:12:03] planted and as I said it didn't go
[2:12:06] without a
[2:12:08] fight we had to fight through
[2:12:11] it I thought Lord how are we going to
[2:12:13] make it in the
[2:12:15] covered because the school was closed
[2:12:19] and we still paid the
[2:12:23] teachers while they weren't teaching for
[2:12:26] 2 years now who carried us
[2:12:31] through not this
[2:12:35] way there's
[2:12:38] somebody that's supporting the
[2:12:41] cause from
[2:12:44] heaven and we didn't skip one month to
[2:12:48] pay the
[2:12:49] teachers and that was in the critical
[2:12:52] times that was in the bad times that was
[2:12:55] in the times when we were in the boom
[2:12:58] backs that God still come behind us and
[2:13:02] say man it is enough money to pay them
[2:13:06] and I'm sure that if there's anything
[2:13:09] ahead of ush that he wants the school if
[2:13:13] he didn't want the school it had to be
[2:13:16] closed down but he wants the school and
[2:13:20] the school will go from strength to
[2:13:23] strength uh from Victory to Victory from
[2:13:27] overcoming to
[2:13:29] overcoming and we'll fight for
[2:13:32] [Applause]
[2:13:40] it I will
[2:13:44] say that we
[2:13:46] had hard time
[2:13:50] because you can only judge the good
[2:13:53] times through the hard
[2:13:56] times I like what my old sister used to
[2:13:58] tell me says
[2:14:00] Edgar when you hit the devil
[2:14:04] hard watch how hard he's going to hit
[2:14:07] you then you know whether you're
[2:14:10] hurting and I'm sure today he hurt
[2:14:12] because they gave us one
[2:14:16] year that school only last one
[2:14:20] [Applause]
[2:14:29] year
[2:14:32] uhh it's not what he
[2:14:35] said it's not what he
[2:14:38] [Applause]
[2:14:46] said
[2:14:49] I'll
[2:14:51] admit that there was
[2:14:54] times that we felt like throwing in the
[2:15:00] towel and those were the times when the
[2:15:04] plun needed to be
[2:15:07] pruned so to cut
[2:15:10] off we to cut off here and cut off there
[2:15:14] so that the main thing can grow
[2:15:18] and friends we cut off if we have to cut
[2:15:21] off we cut
[2:15:23] off because we know when you cut and you
[2:15:25] prune more fruit will come after
[2:15:29] that and because of our cutting more
[2:15:32] fruit comes from
[2:15:35] there I will stand here if I have to cut
[2:15:40] or cut if I have to prune that seed I'll
[2:15:44] prune it if I have to get rid of the dry
[2:15:50] Twigs I'm going to get rid of the dry
[2:15:53] Twigs because I need a living twig uh
[2:15:57] because the Twigs must love uh I shall
[2:16:00] not die but I shall love to praise the
[2:16:06] Lord
[2:16:07] [Applause]
[2:16:16] amen
[2:16:19] and you know after the Twigs was cut off
[2:16:23] and the dried Twigs was
[2:16:28] gone I see the people dancing in front
[2:16:31] you and now you little boys here look at
[2:16:35] them did you see how they
[2:16:38] worship they already had that seed in
[2:16:41] them Hallelujah said hey I must go down
[2:16:45] and praise the Lord I am not here
[2:16:48] because of me there's somebody within me
[2:16:53] that's holding the rain there's
[2:16:55] something within me I cannot explain
[2:17:00] there's something within me that gives
[2:17:03] me
[2:17:04] strength to carry
[2:17:06] [Applause]
[2:17:10] [Music]
[2:17:16] on
[2:17:18] so the hard
[2:17:20] times was the times we went
[2:17:23] through the wall of
[2:17:28] critics we were
[2:17:30] boycotted from all the
[2:17:34] churches but we carried
[2:17:38] on we were in the Hall of
[2:17:42] [Applause]
[2:17:43] critics but now we
[2:17:46] out
[2:17:48] in a Hall of
[2:17:51] [Applause]
[2:17:56] Fame now our Fame is
[2:18:00] growing that even other schools wants to
[2:18:03] steal our
[2:18:05] teachers that's the worst thing when you
[2:18:08] become
[2:18:12] famous they offer your teachers
[2:18:16] something
[2:18:18] better there is no something better than
[2:18:23] elet because here you have the spiritual
[2:18:27] side which no school has the
[2:18:31] spiritual
[2:18:34] [Applause]
[2:18:38] side you have god with you and you have
[2:18:43] education with you how can you lose
[2:18:48] you can't
[2:18:50] [Applause]
[2:18:56] lose I'm glad for God for the job he
[2:18:59] gave
[2:19:00] me he he pays me amen and he makes me
[2:19:04] win souls hallu where can I get a better
[2:19:07] job than that I'm not leaving this
[2:19:11] job even if Raposa said he's a Hamas I'm
[2:19:16] a Hamas you be a h is your business ra
[2:19:21] but me I'm a Christian I belong to Jesus
[2:19:25] [Applause]
[2:19:43] amen it was sure a vision
[2:19:48] but a vision without
[2:19:52] hardship without hard
[2:19:56] work that tries to block it from
[2:20:00] happening is there no
[2:20:03] vision you can have a vision is
[2:20:06] good but a vision is
[2:20:09] fought because the devil don't want that
[2:20:11] thing to be made
[2:20:13] manifest it's going to be critical
[2:20:15] against his kingdom
[2:20:17] yeah when the prophet says Jesus will be
[2:20:21] born they killed all the young
[2:20:25] children BOS said they kill the young
[2:20:28] they kill they always kill the young
[2:20:31] children when Israel was in Egypt did
[2:20:34] they kill the young
[2:20:36] children because that young child if he
[2:20:39] don't have the right seed will grow up a
[2:20:41] terrorist so kill him while he's young
[2:20:44] kill the
[2:20:46] thing
[2:20:50] they've been killing children all the
[2:20:53] time through the
[2:20:57] Bible so
[2:21:00] therefore we thank
[2:21:03] God
[2:21:06] that hardships goes with a
[2:21:10] vision you can only know a great
[2:21:14] vision if you see how many hardships
[2:21:18] you had to
[2:21:23] fight boy did we fight
[2:21:30] hardships the government came along and
[2:21:33] says well we'll give you 200,000 a month
[2:21:37] but then
[2:21:38] we have half of what you got anything in
[2:21:42] a school half belongs to and that's not
[2:21:45] even the wages we pay
[2:21:48] and I said man it would have been a
[2:21:52] help but I do not want the government in
[2:21:57] here and for 20 years no government
[2:22:03] funds
[2:22:04] NOC funds no Raposa funds is in L
[2:22:10] Tabernacle this thing is funded by the
[2:22:14] kingdom of
[2:22:16] heaven
[2:22:19] [Applause]
[2:22:20] [Music]
[2:22:21] [Applause]
[2:22:33] 20 years is a
[2:22:34] lifetime when they say they're giving
[2:22:37] you
[2:22:38] life and that's 20 years and up it's a
[2:22:43] lifetime so there's some people here
[2:22:46] that
[2:22:47] gave up their
[2:22:49] lives to make this a
[2:22:52] success what I like about a
[2:22:55] vision God gives you a vision before the
[2:22:58] foundation of the
[2:22:59] world but he gives you people that will
[2:23:03] help
[2:23:05] you to
[2:23:07] fulfill that
[2:23:09] Vision you never know why you had to go
[2:23:13] and go study to become a
[2:23:15] teacher but God knew he watches watches
[2:23:19] you he says I want you in my
[2:23:22] school I want you to be a teacher in my
[2:23:26] school I want you not only to bring
[2:23:30] education and bige headedness I want you
[2:23:33] to bring amen Holy Ghost educated uh
[2:23:38] angels of God uh so I'm going to direct
[2:23:43] you here's my sister from Zimbabwe amen
[2:23:47] amen God directed her she had to come
[2:23:50] through Amen to South Africa she can't
[2:23:54] understand it but I think now she
[2:23:56] understands it she had to come here and
[2:23:59] support the vision amen and keep the
[2:24:02] hands up uh that tries his best uh to
[2:24:06] bring forth a school uh that is actually
[2:24:10] the best school
[2:24:13] in in the
[2:24:16] south

[2:24:40] workers for his
[2:24:43] ministers and do we have wonderful
[2:24:46] teachers

[2:25:03] you the schol is going from strength to
[2:25:06] strength because in my
[2:25:09] bones there's no relaxing Hallelujah in

[2:25:59] you know in hard
[2:26:06] times you have no
[2:26:12] support
[2:26:14] because failure
[2:26:17] is a lonely
[2:26:22] orphan nobody likes
[2:26:27] failure it's too lonely to
[2:26:31] be in a group that
[2:26:36] fails but in that
[2:26:39] hardship you find people that's got
[2:26:43] H they don't look here they look down
