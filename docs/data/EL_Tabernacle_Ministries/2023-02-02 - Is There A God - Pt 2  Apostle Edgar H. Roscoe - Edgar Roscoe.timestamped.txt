[0:01] for the life
[0:03] of the flesh
[0:06] is in the blood
[0:08] biology
[0:11] genetics
[0:15] and I have given it to you upon the
[0:18] altar to making an atonement
[0:21] for your souls
[0:24] for it is the blood that maketh an
[0:27] atonement for your soul
[0:30] why
[0:31] because the life is in the blood because
[0:35] the Holy Ghost is in the blood and
[0:39] because the Roman soldier pricked open
[0:43] the blood cell and out of the blood cell
[0:47] came the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost
[0:51] came back unto the believer and now the
[0:55] devil can't see anything wrong because
[0:59] all that he sees is the spirit of
[1:02] almighty God
[1:04] we are here to serve God wherever there
[1:07] is God there you want to be wherever
[1:11] there is God I want to be wherever this
[1:15] life I want to be wherever there's a
[1:19] Hallelujah that's where I want to be
[1:23] I'm so glad that I can say I'm a woman
[1:27] I'm one of them that shouted amen when
[1:31] the foundations of the Earth was made
[1:33] I'm one of them my brother and sister
[1:37] amen that's ancientized by the Holy
[1:40] Ghost
[1:41] I'm one of them amen where the sun is
[1:45] burning in my heart
[1:47] sun stands taller
[1:50] amen I totally defeat this uncircumcised
[1:54] full of stands that don't believe in the
[1:58] Holy Ghost
[1:59] I am one of them Hallelujah with my
[2:03] sword of the drawn I'm one of them that
[2:07] says come on come on come on come
[2:17] [Applause]
[2:23] on
[2:27] [Applause]
