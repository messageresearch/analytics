[8:25] living God.
[8:27] I trust you all well.
[8:30] As we are about to enter into our prayer
[8:33] session, can we just go into the word
[8:38] like to turn to Matthew chapter 21:3
[8:45] and he said unto them, it is written, my
[8:50] house shall be called a house of prayer,
[8:54] but you have made it a den of thieves.
[8:59] The house of the Lord is called the
[9:01] house of prayer.
[9:03] And we have
[9:06] someone who has taught us how to pray.
[9:11] So
[9:12] without any further ado, we're going to
[9:15] thank him. We're going to worship him.
[9:19] We're going to praise him. We're going
[9:21] to thank him for the day that he has
[9:23] made. We're going to thank him for our
[9:25] families.
[9:27] We're going to thank him for our jobs or
[9:29] opportunities for making a living.
[9:32] We're going to thank him
[9:34] for this church.
[9:36] We're going to thank him for the
[9:39] leadership.
[9:41] We're going to thank him for the man
[9:43] that came around. Hallelujah.

[14:24] horse rider is galloping. Oh father. Oh
[14:27] Lord God, my God.
[14:29] But here, oh father, is the church. Here
[14:32] is the ministry where they hearkened
[14:34] unto the voice of the hour when it said,
[14:37] "Hurt not the oil and the wine." Uh
[14:40] father, we did not hurt the oil and the
[14:42] wine. Uh in fact, we are the church, oh
[14:44] Lord, uh that has taken the lamp with an

[15:03] though, oh father, I may be a fool in
[15:06] their eyes, uh I am wise in Christ, uh
[15:09] because I have found a placeh and I have
[15:11] found the man where the spirit of truth
[15:14] dwells. Uh what manner of man is this uh
[15:17] in whom the spirit of the Lord dwells?
[15:20] Lord my God, my God, you have made a way
[15:24] for my brother, you have made a way for
[15:27] my sister to come into the house of
[15:30] prayer, to come into the house of
[15:32] worship, to come into the house of
[15:34] praise. Oh father, we can't help but
[15:38] worship. Oh Lord, we can't help but
[15:41] praise you. Jehovah, we can't help but
[15:44] shout. Jehovah Rosco, we can't help it,
[15:47] oh God. Just as Moses couldn't help but
[15:51] name a certain place after you. Uh just
[15:53] as Jacob couldn't help but name a
[15:56] certain place after you. Uh just oh Lord
[15:59] like Abraham. Oh father couldn't help
[16:01] but say Jehovah Gyra. We say Jehovah
[16:06] Rosco because we have seen the man. We
[16:09] have handled him. Oh Lord. Oh God. We
[16:13] are wrestling with the angel. Oh father.

[24:47] oh father, to be without an excuse, oh
[24:50] God, uh to come unto the house of the
[24:52] Lord, uh and to glorify your name, uh in
[24:55] all of their substance, uh in all of
[24:58] their virtue, uh with all of their
[25:00] heart, my God, uh I ask of thee, oh
[25:03] Father, because they are, oh Father, the
[25:06] pride of the Lord. They are oh father
[25:10] the sons and daughters of Jehovah.
[25:14] Oh bread of heaven.
[25:16] Oh bread of heaven. We have been feeding
[25:19] this ministry.
[25:21] Lord we are fen by the word but we are
[25:25] exercised by the spirit. Oh God because
[25:28] we are drunk. We can't just sit and be
[25:32] fen by the word but we are energized and
[25:35] we are stimulated by the spirit. Oh God,
[25:38] we can help but lift up our hands in our
[25:41] homes. We can help but shout unto the
[25:45] Lord. We can help but praise Yahweh
[25:50] Adonai.
[25:51] Yahu
[25:53] Adonai.
[25:55] Oh hope of glory. Oh prince of peace. Oh
[25:59] prince of the house of David. Oh king of
[26:02] kings. Oh Adai.

[26:09] come down. Let the worship come down. Uh
[26:12] may your people uh give you the honor
[26:16] and the glory. Oh Lord, my God. May we
[26:19] find ourselves sitting in heavenly
[26:22] places. My God. And may we find
[26:25] ourselves rejoicing and saying, "I have
[26:28] seen God face to face for the Lord. The
[26:31] Lord has opened the eyes of my heart.
[26:34] And now I see him. And now I see him.
[26:37] And now I see him. And now I see him. Oh
[26:41] my God. My God. Oh the one. My God. My
[26:46] Lord and my God. The Holy One of Israel.
[26:50] a worthy one who was worthy to break the
[26:54] seals and loose them and to make known
[26:58] oh father the seven seals to make known
[27:03] oh father the seven seal Matthew 25 the
[27:08] condition of the coming of the Lord is
[27:10] oil it's oil it's oil it's oil oh God
[27:18] therefore oh God I pray oh father for
[27:22] each and every brother and sister.
[27:25] Lord let us not be deceived. Oh God let
[27:30] us not oh father look for on any other
[27:33] leadership oh God but let us find
[27:36] ourselves where we are and let us bloom
[27:39] where we are planted my God. Father
[27:43] there is filth all over. There is
[27:45] darkness all over my God.
[27:49] But you have given us oh father the
[27:51] leadership oh lord where we oh father
[27:56] can oh lord cleanse our hearts and walk
[28:00] in the right path. The right path of god
[28:03] where we can find ourselves in the right
[28:07] hand of Jehovah. Thy right hand oh God
[28:10] is become glorious in power. Thy right
[28:14] hand oh God had dashed the enemy into
[28:17] pieces. is my God.
[28:19] Oh Lord, oh God, we are partakers of the
[28:23] land. We are not like them who wanted
[28:27] to, oh father,
[28:29] just dwell outside of the land because
[28:32] it's ideal for them and their livestock.
[28:36] We don't want to be like their fathers
[28:38] who give a bad report about the Holy
[28:41] Ghost. We don't want to be like them. Oh
[28:44] Lord, but we want to be like Joshua.
[28:48] We want to be like Caleb. Oh Lord God,
[28:51] we want the land. We want the land. And
[28:55] you have given us the land. Oh father
[28:58] that flows with milk and honey. My God
[29:01] that has the vineyards. Oh father where
[29:04] the wine, oh father is that has the
[29:08] mount of olives. Where the oil is. Oh
[29:12] God, my God, my God. Uh, oh father, my
[29:15] God. Where can we find a ministry like
[29:20] this? Uh, there is nowhere else. Oh
[29:22] father all the places oh God be it in
[29:27] the oh father the United States be it oh
[29:30] Lord God in Europe be it in any part of
[29:34] the north my god oh lord you won't find
[29:38] this placeh you won't find this people
[29:42] you won't find this leadership oh father
[29:47] you will only find it in our tabernacle
[29:51] may it be written in our hearts.
[29:54] And may we never forget it, my God, that
[29:57] we may always find ourselves here. That
[30:01] we may always come here, my God,
[30:05] Lord. My God, we need you more than we
[30:08] need the sunshine.
[30:10] Lord, we need you more than we need the
[30:13] rain. Lord, we need you more than we
[30:17] need the morning, my God.
[30:20] For Lord God, you are the everlasting
[30:22] father.
[30:24] Lord, people come and go, friends come
[30:28] and go, but you are the everlasting
[30:31] father.
[30:33] And oh Lord God, in John chapter 14,
[30:37] behold, you sent the comforter our way.
[30:40] Behold, you sent the spirit of truth our
[30:43] way. Behold, you sent, oh God, the
[30:47] five-fold minister to the five-fold
[30:50] ministry,
[30:51] and you have given him an added gift of
[30:55] wisdom. Oh father, that all things may
[30:59] be made plain unto El tabernacle.
[31:03] Oh Lord, we know about the keystone
[31:05] revelation. We know about evolution, my
[31:08] God. We know, oh Lord, about the oil and
[31:13] the wine. We know about the exposition
[31:16] of the seven church ages. Uh we know
[31:19] about the cloud, my God. We know about
[31:22] the cherubams, oh Lord, that Paul could
[31:25] not speak of particularly.
[31:27] Oh my God, my God. Uh we know, oh
[31:31] father, uh be cause, oh lord, uh you
[31:35] sent a man our way. Uh a man who knows
[31:38] more than we do. Uh a man, oh God, oh
[31:42] God, uh who can never be deceived. Uh oh
[31:45] man. Oh Lord God. Uh oh father who
[31:48] prays. Uh 2:00 a.m. in the morning for
[31:51] my soul. Uh for my soul for my mother's
[31:55] soul. For my brother's soul. Uh for my
[31:58] sister's soul. Oh God. Oh God. Uh the
[32:02] royal priesthood. Adonai. Adonai. You
[32:06] have sent oh father into the area of
[32:09] South Africa. My God. Behold how good it
[32:13] is. Oh Lord, for brothers to dwell
[32:16] together in unity, oh father, and we
[32:19] dwell together, oh God, because there's
[32:22] oil in the camp, my God, the shout of
[32:25] the king is in the camp, Jehovah, the
[32:27] shout of the king is in the camp, my
[32:29] God.
[32:31] Oh, hallelujah.
[32:33] Oh, hallelujah.
[32:36] Oh, we thank you, oh God.
[32:39] We thank you, oh God.
[32:41] We glorify your name. We glorify your
[32:45] name. We give you all, oh father, the
[32:49] honor and the glory, oh Lord. I pray
[32:52] that you preserve, oh Lord our God, the
[32:55] life, oh father of the leadership, oh
[32:58] Lord. Oh father, from the head, oh God,
[33:02] unto the lineage, oh father, unto the
[33:05] children's children, oh Lord. Father, we
[33:08] need the roster family. Oh Lord, I pray,
[33:11] oh God, that you preserve their life all
[33:14] the more for us. Oh God,
[33:17] oh Lord God, as you have given Israel,
[33:20] the Levites, surely you give El
[33:23] Tabernacle, the Rosco, my God, and we
[33:27] thank you, oh God, for the Rosco family,
[33:29] oh Lord. Father, they have given us, oh
[33:32] Father, the opportunity to share, oh
[33:36] Father, my God, the apostle with them,
[33:39] oh Lord. Oh God, had it been for them,
[33:42] oh Lord, they could have just lo for
[33:45] themselves.
[33:47] But oh Lord, they don't have an eel
[33:50] spirit. My God, they have a giving
[33:53] spirit. Oh father, and they have given
[33:55] unto me, oh Lord, they have given unto
[33:58] me, the man of the hour. For cometh the
[34:02] man, come at the hour. And in this hour,
[34:06] oh Lord, on a Saturday night, just like
[34:09] last night, oh father, if I was not
[34:11] here, had not a man come around, had not
[34:15] I heard a voice, I was probably going to
[34:18] be in the filth of the world. I was
[34:21] probably going to be in the red
[34:23] districts. Uh I was probably going to be
[34:25] uh in the drinking sessions. Uh I was
[34:28] probably going to be uh oh Lord, where
[34:30] the world music is, my God. But on a
[34:33] Saturday night, on a Saturday night,
[34:37] here comes a manu. A man, and he knows
[34:41] my name, and he knows my name. And he
[34:44] knows my name. And I will be caught up
[34:48] just like brother Brennham was caught up
[34:50] this word. I was caught up into El
[34:52] Tabernacle on a Saturday night. Uh and
[34:55] the blessings of the Lord uh came down
[34:59] not just the birthight but the blessings
[35:01] of the birthright uh because we wrestle
[35:04] with the angel. We wrestle with the
[35:06] angel. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God we wrestle
[35:10] with the angel. Uh and blessings are
[35:13] come upon us. Oh Lord.
[35:16] Oh Lord, we thank you
[35:19] for the man that has taught us how to
[35:22] pray.
[35:24] Oh Lord, oh God,
[35:27] this Bible could just been a story.
[35:31] This Bible could just been a story, my
[35:33] Lord.
[35:35] But now, oh father, the bride, she sees
[35:38] the love letter. She sees the love
[35:41] letter of the bridegroom.
[35:44] She sees the mysteries of God
[35:48] while the world does not see you.
[35:51] Lord, we see you face to face.
[35:55] While Moses could only see the back
[35:57] parts of your mind,
[35:59] the back parts of your body, my God,
[36:03] we see the bosom of God. For you said
[36:08] that you will be with us and in us
[36:10] forever, my God. Not just now but
[36:15] forever my father.
[36:18] So Lord God
[36:20] if they say that we are cults. If they
[36:23] say that we are brainwashed
[36:26] then we oh father are the members of the
[36:29] Lord Jesus Christ. Then we if we are
[36:33] brainwashed
[36:34] we are washed by the blood of the lamb.
[36:38] I'm better off being brainwashed by the
[36:41] blood of the lamb than being brainwashed
[36:43] by the filth of the world.
[36:46] Oh God. Oh God, what good it is? What
[36:50] good is it? Oh father,
[36:52] if I go to hell with a Bible, oh father,
[36:56] what good is it, oh God, if I go to hell
[37:00] still knowing all the commandments?
[37:03] What good is it, oh God, if I open my
[37:07] eyes in hell and all the days of my
[37:10] life? I was quoting brother Brennham.
[37:14] What good is it, oh God, if I don't have
[37:17] the oil?
[37:19] What good is it, oh father,
[37:22] if I don't have the oil? Oh God, my God,
[37:27] give me oil in my lamp. Keep me burning
[37:30] till the break of day. Keep me burning
[37:33] till the break of day. Oh my God. Keep
[37:38] me burning till the break of day.
[37:42] Oh Lord my God.
[37:44] You provide the fire.
[37:47] I'll provide the sacrifice.
[37:50] I will open s inside. My God. I will
[37:54] open up inside. You provide the spirit.
[37:57] Oh God. Thy word is a lamp to my feet.
[38:03] Oh Lord, I need oil. My God,
[38:07] I don't want to open my eyes in hell
[38:09] like the rich young ruler because Oh
[38:12] God, he kept all your commandments, my
[38:15] God. He kept your statutes, my God, you
[38:19] love him, oh God,
[38:21] but he didn't have blood.
[38:24] He didn't have the life in the blood. It
[38:27] didn't have the baptism of the Holy
[38:29] Ghost.
[38:32] Oh God.
[38:34] Oh God. My God.
[38:37] This hidden life in me that's stepping
[38:40] out.
[38:42] This perfect man in the image of the
[38:45] Lord God Almighty.
[38:48] This child of God that is within me is
[38:53] stepping out. And one of these days, one
[38:57] of these days, we will be sweeping the
[38:59] sky.
[39:02] But as long as I'm on the earth, my God,
[39:06] may I b myself.
[39:09] Oh God, worshiping you all the days of
[39:11] my life
[39:14] because it's the only thing I can do.
[39:17] Oh foolish virgins.
[39:20] Oh God, they seek to please you
[39:23] with their eyes and their lips,
[39:26] but they never rendered out their heart.
[39:28] My God.
[39:30] Oh God. Oh God, how fortunate is El
[39:34] Tabernacle? How fortunate am I to be a
[39:38] written apistl?
[39:40] Because I opened the eyes of my heart. I
[39:43] opened my heart unto you and the spirit
[39:46] of the Lord came in. I opened my heart
[39:49] unto you and the spirit of the Lord came
[39:52] in. Now when they ask oh God and they
[39:56] say which king is ruling your life I
[39:59] will say oh my god the hope of glory
[40:04] king Jesus God the god king himself the
[40:08] king of kingsuh he is the ruler of my
[40:11] life because I opened the eyes of my
[40:15] heart and I see him in the compartment
[40:18] of my heart there is oil there is oil in
[40:22] my handh There is oil in my lamb. There
[40:26] is oil in my lamb. Because oh God, thou
[40:30] tabernacle is wise. Thou tabernacle is
[40:33] wise. Oh God, my God, we didn't just
[40:36] take the lamp. We took the extra vessel.
[40:40] Lord, while the world Oh God, they
[40:42] rejected the extra vessel. Oh Lord,
[40:46] while they rejected the extra vessel,
[40:49] while they were satisfied
[40:51] with the light the lamb had,
[40:54] we weren't satisfied.
[40:56] The wise was not satisfied.
[40:59] We couldn't help but take the extra
[41:01] vessel.
[41:03] And the extra vessel,
[41:05] he stands every combined
[41:08] right behind us.
[41:10] And he gives out the oil. And he gives
[41:13] out the oil. Oh my Lord, my God, how can
[41:18] I say? Oh, how I can say like David
[41:22] said, oh thou, oh God, anointest my head
[41:26] with oil. My cup runth over. Oh goodness
[41:31] and mercy, goodness and mercy, goodness
[41:35] and mercy. They follow me all the days
[41:38] of my life
[41:42] because oh God we are not the ones who
[41:46] are sitting in the seat of the scope.
[41:48] Lord my God we are the ones uh oh God.
[41:52] Uh who excites you who entertains the
[41:56] angel.
[41:58] Oh God my God. They didn't want to
[42:01] entertain the angel.
[42:04] They rejected the colored porter because
[42:07] of the color of his skin. But the wise
[42:11] virgin, they took the extra vessel.
[42:14] Because the extra vessel is the baptism
[42:17] of the Holy Ghost, they rejected that
[42:20] container even though they wanted the
[42:23] content there in.
[42:25] But you can't separate the gift from the
[42:27] man.
[42:29] You can't separate the gift from the
[42:31] man.
[42:33] And so we thank you for the man cuz we
[42:36] know, oh God,
[42:38] when the man comes around,
[42:41] something is left behind.
[42:44] Something is left behind. My Lord,
[42:47] eternal life is left behind. The Lord's
[42:50] release is left behind.
[42:53] Oh my God, the workings of the Holy
[42:55] Ghost is left behind
[42:58] because you sent an angel before us. You
[43:02] open the year of 2025
[43:05] with sending the angel before us to keep
[43:09] us in the way. Because oh Lord, nothing
[43:13] happens unless the angel comes down.
[43:16] And oh God, it is recorded in your
[43:18] Bible. Oh Lord, that the angel of the
[43:21] Lord always comes down. That the angel
[43:25] of the Lord is always in pious skins
[43:28] when he comes down. Oh, how Gideon says
[43:32] he has seen the face of God. Oh my Lord,
[43:36] how Manoah and his wife say, "Oh, we
[43:40] have seen God face to face.
[43:43] You are the same angel that sits under
[43:46] an oak tree. You are the same angel that
[43:49] stood next to Brother Prenam, God, and
[43:52] heal the people. You are the same angel
[43:56] that we see, oh God, every month. Oh
[43:59] God, every month, oh God,
[44:03] how can we be silent?
[44:06] How can we be silent? How can we sit in
[44:09] the seat of the scornful when we are in
[44:12] the midst of angels?
[44:15] How can we sit in the presence where the
[44:18] oil is dropping down?
[44:21] Oh Lord, oh Lord, may more of the oil
[44:25] fall upon us till we are so slippery, oh
[44:28] Lord, uh that the devil's hands, oh God,
[44:32] they can't even get us, oh father, so
[44:35] slippery with oil, oh God, that he
[44:38] complains and says you lay a hedge
[44:41] around them, oh God. Oh God, keep us, oh
[44:46] God, in the righteous way. Keep us, oh
[44:50] God, in the way of holiness.
[44:54] How can we be holy without the Holy
[44:56] Ghost? My God. You only want to see you,
[45:00] my God. You only want to see you, my
[45:04] father. That's why we plunge beneath the
[45:07] blood, my God. That's why we cover
[45:10] ourselves with the blood, my God.
[45:12] Because red through red makes white, my
[45:15] God. And now, oh father, because the
[45:19] token is applied, the atken, the the
[45:22] atonement is made. The rain, oh God, the
[45:26] letter rain is fallen on us now. Oh God,
[45:31] we have fellowship.
[45:33] Lord, the blood of bulls and goats, they
[45:37] had their time, oh God, it was not
[45:40] enough, oh father, it would just
[45:43] temporarily cover it. Oh Lord, but the
[45:46] blood of the lamb
[45:48] washes me entirely.
[45:51] Behold the saints of God. Though their
[45:54] sins be scarlet,
[45:56] though their sins be crimson, Lord, you
[45:59] washed us whiter than snow. Because you
[46:02] have given us the Lord's release. You
[46:05] have given us, oh father, the workings
[46:08] of the Holy Ghost. Because what is the
[46:11] Holy Ghost given for? Oh Lord God, what
[46:14] is the Holy Ghost given for? That's why
[46:17] we thank you, oh Father. We thank you,
[46:20] oh Lord, for the adoption. Oh Father, we
[46:24] thank you, oh Lord, for the Holy Ghost,
[46:27] my God. We will say it over and we will
[46:30] say it over and we will say it over and
[46:33] over again, my God, because this does
[46:36] not cease. This cannot die. This cannot
[46:40] die. Father, we see how the other
[46:43] movements, oh Lord, uh, how they died
[46:46] off, my God, because the letter killth,
[46:48] my God, but oh father, oh Lord, my God,
[46:53] may those, oh father, who will look, may
[46:56] they behold just like a milliel, will be
[46:59] held and said, uh, if this is of a
[47:02] manuh, it will cease, but if this is of
[47:05] God, it shall not cease. And we have
[47:09] received of the Lord. Uh because we
[47:11] don't just have a man of God. We have a
[47:15] God man. Uh we have a man that is sent
[47:19] our way. We have oh God a mighty angel
[47:24] that's come down. We have oh father the
[47:27] workings of the Holy Ghost. Oh father
[47:30] where we have enough oil to live the
[47:33] life. We have enough oil to love my God.
[47:37] We have enough oil, oh father, to speak
[47:40] life and peace, oh Lord, my God, the
[47:44] blessings of the birthright uh is upon
[47:47] our tabernacle, my God, uh may you equip
[47:50] us well, oh father, with the
[47:52] understanding, oh father, of cherishing
[47:54] the Holy Ghost uh that we, oh Father,
[47:57] may not underestimate, oh Father, what
[48:00] we have, my God, uh there's nothing
[48:02] better in this world, uh than what we
[48:05] have, my God. There's nothing better in
[48:07] this world than the baptism of the Holy
[48:10] Ghost. Uh because when we have the
[48:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost, uh Lord,
[48:14] anything we ask in your name, anything
[48:16] we ask in your name. And so, oh Lord,
[48:19] like the songwriters say we will speak
[48:22] Jesus. Uh oh God, because uh we have the
[48:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Uh we have
[48:27] the author of the Bible. Uh we have the
[48:29] oil himself. Uh we have the anointing.
[48:32] Uh we have the Christ.
[48:34] We have Jehovah Rosco. We have Jehovah
[48:36] Gyra. We have Jehovah Ni. We speak
[48:40] Jesus. We speak Jesus. Uh I speak Jesus
[48:44] for my family. I speak Jesus for my
[48:46] brothers. Uh I speak Jesus for my
[48:48] sisters. Uh I speak Jesus. Uh I speak

[51:45] Oh God, because the rich young ruler,
[51:49] he valued all the other things
[51:53] instead of the sacrifice himself.
[51:56] But here comes a man saying, "You can
[52:00] have the whole lamp,
[52:03] but if you don't have oil,
[52:06] he will open your eyes in hell."
