[0:00] good evening El
[0:03] Tabernacle and
[0:05] um
[0:07] listeners around the
[0:09] world that's going to listen to this
[0:13] clip that I made that I'm going to
[0:16] make and um we greet you in the
[0:24] name of our King
[0:27] God the soon coming Messiah
[0:31] to the Jews but first to the
[0:34] Gentiles the Lord Jesus
[0:39] Christ we are actually forced to make
[0:43] this
[0:45] clip because there is still people
[0:49] around going and
[0:52] saying that
[0:55] I
[0:58] prophesied that the Lord is
[1:02] coming and
[1:05] um I think brother Kurt told us not the
[1:07] other day another brother told him and
[1:10] then when the brother went to go check
[1:11] up he saw that I never said a thing like
[1:13] that and he had to phone C back and
[1:16] apologize not in our church in another
[1:20] church the r will also told me a brother
[1:23] told him
[1:25] that and then he told the brother I was
[1:27] in that meeting can you tell me where on
[1:31] that tape does he make that prediction
[1:33] that you're talking about and the
[1:35] brother couldn't answer him so I um I
[1:40] just fell to save
[1:42] God uh our church because I'm not send
[1:47] to these guys in the message you know
[1:50] and
[1:51] I I I have a
[1:54] responsibility uh for my church and uh
[1:59] that's why
[2:00] brother Branham laid hands on
[2:04] me and Prophet visit South Africa
[2:08] because he saw that I would have a
[2:10] church or
[2:13] churches and I will be have to be
[2:16] responsible for
[2:17] them and I
[2:20] will actually preach exactly what he
[2:23] preach or say exactly what he says or
[2:27] prophesy again
[2:30] what Revelations
[2:32] 107 has brought
[2:35] forth so that's why we are just
[2:39] recapping
[2:41] um uh the uh Jubilee message that I
[2:46] preach which has gone around the world
[2:49] everybody heard it and um it wasn't done
[2:53] in secret I preach it all over the world
[2:56] uh I let it go all over the world and uh
[3:00] uh but you know people when you are a
[3:06] Target they try to get any little thing
[3:10] to put on you and make you wrong that's
[3:13] why Jesus says blessed are they if they
[3:16] speak all manner of wrong things
[3:19] lying you know for my name's sake
[3:22] blessed are
[3:24] ye so we thought about recapping just
[3:27] for Al Tabernacle sake
[3:30] and uh I got to a place where I don't
[3:32] care about anybody
[3:34] else if
[3:37] somebody wants to know something I will
[3:39] have all the patience in the world to
[3:42] sit with him if they haven't got to
[3:45] arant Spirit and if they come from other
[3:48] church and try and do my best to show
[3:53] them where we
[3:54] stand and uh without trying to steal
[3:58] Souls
[4:00] but uh time has gone
[4:03] by and uh you don't find people wanting
[4:07] to know more about God they
[4:12] um
[4:14] seated in their
[4:16] churches and their doctrines so that's
[4:20] why I said I I have to care just for El
[4:23] tacle
[4:25] now we have to recap a few things here
[4:29] for a couple of
[4:31] minutes and because people are going
[4:33] around saying I said the Rapture is
[4:36] going to take place last year 2310
[4:42] 2024 last year was 49 years so they were
[4:46] wrong they were
[4:48] lying you know last year was not the
[4:51] 70th Jubilee last year was 49 years you
[4:57] know wedn they were be 50 years but they
[5:01] said I said last year and that just
[5:05] shows you that they do not
[5:07] understand uh the 70th Jubilee and the
[5:11] dates and stuff like that that's why
[5:14] their pastors don't understand it and
[5:17] their pastors can't preach on it and now
[5:21] because I preach on it and I made sense
[5:24] to it I must be attacked and stupid guys
[5:28] would come
[5:30] and you said no don't say that well uh
[5:33] brother Paul says in Galatians who has
[5:36] bewitch you you foolish Galatians you
[5:39] know so were and foolishly attack me and
[5:43] when I said man hey uh 2023 is not the
[5:49] 70th Jubilee then everybody backed off
[5:52] you know and uh it showed me that they
[5:56] didn't understand a bit on what I was
[5:58] saying therefore it is for my church and
[6:02] we don't care what anybody else say
[6:05] about
[6:06] it
[6:07] so they lied about me saying the rapure
[6:12] will take place last year you know and
[6:16] last year was not the 70th
[6:19] Jubilee now this year
[6:22] 2024 which is Wednesday
[6:25] coming is the 70th
[6:28] Jubilee and the changed the tune and
[6:31] said I said the Rapture will take place
[6:34] Wednesday which is another
[6:37] line I have never said a thing like
[6:42] that and uh I cannot
[6:47] understand they call themselves The
[6:51] Bride but they're lying like
[6:53] this they call themselves well we got
[6:57] love but they like like this you don't
[7:01] find love in untruth love rejoice in
[7:06] truth you must speak truth that's love
[7:10] but these all these guys are lying
[7:12] they're a bunch of liars you know and uh
[7:15] to me don't come and preach love to me
[7:18] you know because none of you Sayes it
[7:20] and I proved it What Love Is Love is a
[7:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost full stop
[7:27] nothing more nothing less
[7:30] so that's why we put the clip on social
[7:35] media what I said it's
[7:38] on it's on there for
[7:41] months we checked it up it will be a
[7:46] year and a couple of months that we put
[7:49] the clip up there to explain the whole
[7:54] thing you know and yet they go on for
[7:58] the whole year so how would you miss it
[8:01] if I put the clip on there for the whole
[8:03] year so I got to come back again now and
[8:07] do it again you know so that they could
[8:11] be judged on their lives with their
[8:15] pastors and
[8:17] all second point I invited pastors of
[8:20] other churches to be in that meeting and
[8:24] all our preachers because brother
[8:28] Brandon said
[8:30] said um don't say I said that 1977 the
[8:35] Lord is coming he said he three times in
[8:39] uh Daniel 70 weeks and yet look how the
[8:43] media went on that brother BR prophesied
[8:47] now we're not prophesying I never
[8:49] prophesied and I never said thus say the
[8:51] Lord you know on the 70 weeks of Daniel
[8:56] there nothing like that and brother Bram
[8:58] says he never said it is thus sayth the
[9:03] Lord so uh but they finish him up until
[9:08] we came out with the 70th Jubilee and
[9:11] showed exactly that brother B was right
[9:16] 1977 was a start of the 70th J cuz
[9:22] 1974 it started to
[9:25] 2024 so uh required him down praise God
[9:30] that we could be Protectors of this
[9:33] wonderful message this is the clip we
[9:36] played for
[9:38] months or one year and yet pastors are
[9:42] lying I never change anything it's told
[9:45] the 70th week 70th
[9:50] Jubilee Wednesday
[9:52] coming it cannot be changed you can't
[9:57] shift it because that's the amount of
[10:00] time given to the Jews so nobody can
[10:04] change it it's the 70th
[10:07] Jubilee so this is the
[10:09] club that we played for a
[10:13] year is there a
[10:15] time that men will be cut
[10:20] off according to God's
[10:22] Bible when will the 70th Jubilee
[10:27] be the expected
[10:30] time the desired time for God to
[10:35] come not the desired time that Edgar
[10:39] Rosco
[10:41] said because everybody said something
[10:44] the 7even day Adventist also had a date
[10:47] and it
[10:48] failed the Jehovah Witness had a date
[10:52] and it failed because it was their date
[10:56] but the 7th
[10:58] Jubilee is nobody's date but yahweh's
[11:02] date that's the
[11:05] difference
[11:07] Lord what will the end
[11:10] be go your way
[11:13] there it's
[11:15] concealed until the time of the
[11:19] end when you see a preacher preach on
[11:23] maratha then it sounds for you what will
[11:28] the end
[11:32] be that's why he says it will be the
[11:36] aering in of the Millennium because the
[11:39] 6,000 years is finished we moving into
[11:42] the seventh
[11:44] Hallelujah the only thing that can
[11:47] change that date is the long suffering
[11:50] of
[11:52] Christ nothing more my spirit shall not
[11:57] always strive with men
[11:59] cut off
[12:02] time have you
[12:07] realized that such a short time
[12:10] left in the short time God in the short
[12:14] time amen Los Angeles has to go down in
[12:18] the short time that woman has to raise
[12:21] in America and
[12:25] 2024 is the USA elections again
[12:29] could it be the
[12:31] date that that woman will be elected
[12:34] that will cause America to go down yes B
[12:39] believe yes you will see them going down
[12:43] Los
[12:47] Angeles we are not here
[12:52] forever there must come an appointed
[12:56] time
[13:00] for God to
[13:01] come and
[13:06] close isn't
[13:09] there an appointed
[13:12] time for men on the
[13:16] earth yes there
[13:20] is you have
[13:24] prayed maybe five times a day like the
[13:28] Muslims
[13:31] maybe three times a day like to
[13:35] choose but now you have to pray without
[13:38] ceasing so there you have it we played
[13:41] this for over a
[13:44] year and how could you misunderstand it
[13:50] is my problem it just shows you
[13:53] jealousy and it just shows you that they
[13:56] are looking to get something thing on
[14:00] me so uh I just want to clear it with my
[14:05] people I don't care what the other
[14:06] people say about
[14:08] it I want to clear it with my people
[14:12] which I
[14:14] did so uh that's the
[14:18] clip now the big question
[14:22] is now who said that the 70th Jubilee is
[14:27] the rapture
[14:30] and the ushering in of the
[14:33] Millennium who said
[14:35] that I never did it doesn't come from
[14:39] me then who said
[14:42] it now let's welcome brother brandham to
[14:44] the
[14:45] podium to play Daniel 70 weeks
[14:49] tape now mark down in your book a little
[14:54] scripture here I want to give you
[14:56] Leviticus 25 beginning with the eth
[14:58] verse
[15:00] God called a jubilee every 49th
[15:03] year the 50th year was a jubilee we know
[15:07] that yeah we understand that from the
[15:10] first Jubilee of Leviticus
[15:14] 258 and
[15:17] 1977 will be the 70th Jubilee making
[15:21] exactly
[15:22] 3,430 years amen hallelujah Jubilee
[15:26] means going up amen
[15:30] Rel oh we're watching for the coming of
[15:33] that glad Millennium day when our
[15:35] blessed Lord shall come and catch his
[15:37] waiting briway oh the world is growing
[15:40] crying for that day of sweet release
[15:43] when our savior shall come back to earth
[15:46] again we got 17 years
[15:49] left until
[15:52] 77 will be the 70th Jubilee since the
[15:56] beginning of jubilees amen and what will
[15:59] it be oh brother watch close now don't
[16:02] miss it it'll be the Jubilee of the
[16:06] going up of the Gentile bride and the
[16:08] return of Christ to the Jews am when
[16:11] they go out of bondage
[16:14] amen because Jesus did not say no man
[16:17] could know the year month or week in
[16:19] which his coming was to be completed so
[16:22] I repeat I sincerely believe and
[16:24] maintain as a private student of the
[16:26] word along with divine inspiration ation
[16:29] that 1977 ought to terminate the world
[16:32] systems and Usher in the Millennium so
[16:35] now I'd like to ask you now who said the
[16:39] 70th
[16:41] Jubilee is the rapture me your Prophet
[16:45] said so so you want to say that I am
[16:48] wrong I don't got it from the prophet
[16:51] yeah you read the prophet said so so
[16:53] blame the prophet if you if you say no
[16:56] no no it doesn't and you got all these
[16:58] other excuses say you against your own
[17:01] Prophet you're talking against your own
[17:03] own Prophet I only quoted what he said
[17:09] it doesn't come from me Paul says that
[17:11] the word of God come out of you or did
[17:14] he come to you this word came to me from
[17:20] brother brandham so brother brandham
[17:23] said it is the
[17:25] rapture not Ed garos
[17:29] so get your facts
[17:31] straight I am quoting your prophet and
[17:35] you can now go against it he'll meet you
[17:39] at the Judgment
[17:40] bar there is make Believers in this
[17:45] message Great Pretenders that they
[17:47] believe the message but they can't even
[17:50] take a quote like this how could they be
[17:53] in the
[17:55] message so you either know the message
[18:00] or you a foolish version in the message
[18:03] or you a great Pretender you're only
[18:08] pretending that you
[18:12] believe the Bible says
[18:17] so BC
[18:20] 538 Gabriel came to Daniel and spoke to
[18:26] him about it
[18:29] the
[18:30] chronologist with a many books says
[18:34] so and now the prophet William Brenham
[18:37] said
[18:38] so July the 30th of the 8th month
[18:45] 1961 said
[18:47] so and I edar Rosco underline it when is
[18:53] the 70th
[18:55] Jubilee 77 is the beginning
[18:59] of the 70th Jubilee because the 70th
[19:02] Jubilee started in
[19:05] 1974 so he said in
[19:08] 1977 we're in the 70th Jubilee so I
[19:12] clarifi that thing so regardless of what
[19:16] you say it's the 70th Jubilee so you
[19:21] going to ask brother Brandon what you
[19:22] want to ask brother brandom don't come
[19:24] and ask
[19:26] me I will speak to my church on Sunday
[19:30] on Saturday at the combined
[19:34] meeting I said it's not my
[19:37] date but it's God's appointed
[19:40] time he can change it in in his
[19:45] longsuffering like I brought it out on
[19:48] that
[19:49] message but in the
[19:52] longsuffering all the times that
[19:54] examples I gave no soul got saved
[19:59] so think about after
[20:02] Wednesday if you don't understand him
[20:05] then it's your baby and your pastor's
[20:08] baby you are trying to too hard to find
[20:12] me
[20:13] wrong and God protected me oh Edgar osar
[20:18] said he's greater than brother brandham
[20:21] he is the eighth
[20:23] messenger is Jehovah
[20:26] God now he said is the rapture is going
[20:30] to take
[20:32] place he's messing around with human
[20:36] like Rin Thompson said he's not that boy
[20:40] in Propet visit South Africa and no
[20:44] proof I ask you please on all those
[20:48] points send me the tape where I said
[20:52] those things is now for how many years
[20:56] you guys cannot produce the tape where I
[20:59] said these things so you will work it on
[21:04] with God very soon at the day of
[21:08] judgment I explained this next Saturday
[21:11] at our
[21:12] combine I'll
[21:16] be and I said in a
[21:20] clip it'll be an
[21:24] ordinary
[21:26] day I would like you to write it down or
[21:29] make an indelible mark on your mind what
[21:34] I'm going to tell
[21:38] you you'll see the 23rd will
[21:43] come it's on the
[21:46] Wednesday I will be
[21:51] here but you'll see it's going to be an
[21:53] ordinary
[21:55] day it's going to look as if nothing has
[21:58] happened
[22:00] yes Mark that
[22:06] [Music]
[22:07] down they'll still have
[22:15] church
[22:19] Elders there's still going to be alter
[22:21] calls
[22:28] there's still going to be people that
[22:30] wants to give their hearts to the
[22:36] Lord the surely is going to
[22:41] be weeping and
[22:51] crying but it's going to be too late for
[22:53] Tears
[22:55] [Music]
[23:07] you mark that
[23:11] down because in that
[23:15] [Music]
[23:18] Dimension it's going to be all
[23:20] [Music]
[23:22] over
[23:25] Israel when
[23:27] God told told them to take the land they
[23:33] didn't and God wanted to destroy them
[23:35] immediately
[23:37] and and Moses
[23:40] begged and he says I won't destroy them
[23:43] but they still going to
[23:45] die they went on for 40
[23:50] years serving
[23:52] God
[23:54] crying having a prophet
[23:59] eating
[24:04] Mana but they were cut off they
[24:07] died all of
[24:10] them but in the
[24:12] [Music]
[24:14] natural it looked all
[24:20] right and if I am
[24:24] right which I very much doubt I'm wrong
[24:30] I don't know why all the ministers are
[24:34] calling some are
[24:37] calling and some are dying
[24:42] [Applause]
[24:59] it is like that
[25:02] already how is it going to be when the
[25:04] thing is cut off
[25:11] completely in the message World it will
[25:13] go on the same like it goes on every
[25:16] [Music]
[25:20] day but if you're
[25:23] spiritual if you're in this prophetic
[25:25] class
[25:27] [Music]
[25:29] I'm sure you already saw
[25:36] [Music]
[25:38] things so all that I told you to make a
[25:42] mental note and a note in your
[25:46] Bible because it cannot be moved it
[25:49] cannot be
[25:50] changed the time Factor runs out the
[25:56] 23rd one of the Jewish
[25:58] Rabbi said we won't forget the 23rd of
[26:05] October and going to read Daniel 70
[26:08] weeks God told
[26:12] Daniel there's only 70 weeks
[26:17] allotted to the
[26:20] Jews 70
[26:23] weeks and not more time they were given
[26:27] 70 weeks
[26:30] that was that time that God was going to
[26:32] take away all
[26:35] transgressions that
[26:37] means that I'll be back with
[26:40] Israel
[26:42] [Applause]
[26:44] read okay that is
[26:49] um what I said in the
[26:54] 70th Chile
[27:00] now the camia ER
[27:05] quote we were first to point out that
[27:09] that quote
[27:12] speak of two women a natural woman that
[27:16] will be
[27:18] chosen vice president and then
[27:22] president and the Roman Catholic church
[27:25] so either Camila or Trump choosing will
[27:28] be bad Trump can bring in the Roman
[27:32] Catholic Church
[27:35] money
[27:37] prosperity and Camila can bring
[27:40] in that woman that will destroy
[27:44] America I said
[27:47] it from that time brother Bram says
[27:51] 1960 the 7
[27:53] month 16th day he says thus sayith
[27:58] the
[27:59] Lord in other words God said it not
[28:05] brother Brenham God said
[28:08] it there'll be a woman rule a woman rule
[28:15] before the end time listen here before
[28:19] the end time she'll either be president
[28:24] or vice
[28:26] president or the Roman Catholic
[28:31] Church
[28:33] listen there's three important points in
[28:37] this quote Point number one before the
[28:42] end
[28:44] time why does he say before the end
[28:48] time because the seventh vision is the
[28:52] end time the abor the seventh trumpet
[28:58] Revelations
[28:59] 11:14 the Third Woe cometh quickly it
[29:04] comes quickly after her that's the
[29:09] end remember that so her coming
[29:14] in is not the end of the
[29:17] world get me straight please but the
[29:21] bride is gone then when this happens
[29:25] when the bomb Falls when
[29:28] that wo comes remember the bride is gone
[29:33] before the end of the world in other
[29:37] words she won't see the end of the world
[29:41] so brother BR says a woman will
[29:44] rise she'll be he says she'll be
[29:47] president or vice
[29:50] president well she's running for both
[29:53] she already fulfilled the
[29:56] one she is and
[30:00] was the vice
[30:03] president and now she's
[30:07] running to be a candidate for
[30:12] presidency so the quote is running with
[30:15] God's will so
[30:17] far we're going to bring this back again
[30:20] to you her eyes was
[30:24] 1990 Deputy district attorney 20
[30:28] courtroom prosecutor San Francisco
[30:32] two
[30:34] uh3 district attorney 2010 general
[30:39] attorney
[30:41] 2016 US senator 2020 elected vice
[30:47] president
[30:49] 2024 president
[30:52] candidate isn't the scary
[31:02] straight with the
[31:08] quote anybody can see this could it
[31:13] be El
[31:15] Tabernacle could it
[31:17] be so the quot is running with God's
[31:22] will so
[31:25] far from the same quote
[31:28] from that time he says or the Catholic
[31:34] church so here we see distinctly two
[31:37] woman a natural woman that will be voted
[31:43] in and a spiritual woman which is the
[31:46] Roman Catholic Church that's not voted
[31:49] in she just comes in but the natural
[31:54] woman that will be president she gets
[31:57] voted in
[31:58] so I never saw this just the other day
[32:01] and as I went through the quotes and I
[32:04] think there about 200 or so many quotes
[32:07] or even more uh and all if you read
[32:12] really those quotes you'll see he speaks
[32:16] every time of two
[32:18] human that's
[32:20] why we have two candidates for the two
[32:25] woman one is Trump and the other one is
[32:29] Camila one will be Camila that is voted
[32:33] in so far we see how votes
[32:36] wi the other one might be Trump that
[32:39] will let the Roman Catholic Church come
[32:42] in because of the
[32:44] pressure of the Roman Catholic
[32:48] church because America owes her
[32:51] trillions of dollars they can't even pay
[32:55] back the interest so World should put
[32:58] the screws on Trump if he gets elected
[33:02] and he will give in then to her and
[33:05] afterwards speak as the
[33:08] dragon it's two scenarios here because
[33:12] the Roman Catholic Church when he says
[33:14] the Roman Catholic Church he says I got
[33:16] it in Brackets and you know what that
[33:19] mean I don't have to take it to
[33:22] school so
[33:24] um he says all the Catholic Church to
[33:28] woman then he concludes the
[33:32] quote by saying thus saith the
[33:38] Lord so it must come to
[33:43] pass is this the season for
[33:46] it you might have to check that thing
[33:54] out
[33:56] so the you
[33:58] have 70
[34:00] weeks 70
[34:03] Jubilee and
[34:06] also
[34:09] Camila all speaking about the End
[34:13] Time season is
[34:16] Right 70 weeks 70 Daniel is going to be
[34:20] settled on
[34:22] Wednesday and then the elections we're
[34:25] waiting to see which one comes in
[34:28] to bring in one of the two
[34:31] human you know and a person wonders
[34:35] about the Roman Catholic
[34:38] Church Revelations
[34:42] 17 very very much you worried about
[34:45] it but both is a
[34:49] worry But the irony of the thing the
[34:53] bottom
[34:55] line the colel
[34:58] is that we are at the
[35:01] end the ceiling will go
[35:04] on the regardless of what
[35:07] happens the ceiling is going to go
[35:12] on so I would like to
[35:16] on
[35:17] Saturday show you what brother Brenham
[35:20] says what's going to take place if these
[35:24] things fall in line
[35:28] it's only the elections in front of
[35:31] us and then he says something and I feel
[35:37] sorry for the Brethren that's in this
[35:40] message that has rejected the Holy
[35:46] Ghost and
[35:50] actually gone for a Baptist way of
[35:55] worship I feel sorry for them after
[36:00] Saturday you'll see what a mistake they
[36:03] made I can't but help bringing this up
[36:07] and I know I said that I will never
[36:10] mention him
[36:12] again but I think about Raymond Thompson
[36:15] about 15 20 years ago with a h
[36:21] Revelation and I
[36:24] was walking up to him and ask him
[36:28] you see the Holy Ghost never came so the
[36:31] Holy Ghost never came in 1979 when it
[36:34] fell in El Tabernacle and then went over
[36:36] to America and and uh many other
[36:41] places so uh he was very very rude and
[36:45] I'm glad that angel of God was there he
[36:47] wrote everything down he will meet one
[36:49] another there and he said uh you preach
[36:53] what you want to preach we preach what
[36:55] we want to preach
[36:57] and um then that thing didn't work out
[37:00] because it was a bunch of nonsense third
[37:02] phase worship and all that was all
[37:05] nonsense you know so that's why I just
[37:09] wonder if these
[37:12] guys didn't bless from the Holy Ghost
[37:15] and now it's too late to get
[37:17] it I watch them every now and then their
[37:21] services especially when they
[37:23] preach and I don't feel no Holy Ghost
[37:26] there so
[37:29] um we have come to the end it's going to
[37:32] be
[37:34] worse because God is now going to go
[37:37] extra mile
[37:39] with
[37:41] Israel and I want to bring it out next
[37:44] week on Saturday to show you exactly
[37:47] what's going to happen
[37:49] then so may God bless
[37:52] you and
[37:56] um brother the B says in the token this
[37:59] is what he says the sleeping virgin
[38:01] coming in trying to buy oril that is
[38:04] that time when the bride went in and the
[38:06] rest of them was left here did you ever
[38:08] think what happened they went right
[38:10] ahead preaching and thinking they were
[38:12] getting Soul saved and everything and
[38:13] did not know it they knew nothing about
[38:16] it the Church of War thinking souls are
[38:18] being saved and everything else and the
[38:20] church is already the bride sealed away
[38:24] don't know it certainly that's exactly
[38:27] what the scripture Noah went in the ark
[38:29] God seal it out truly and the time will
[38:32] come when men and women will cry to God
[38:34] and even think that they've got
[38:36] something when they haven't it's exactly
[38:39] right the scripture speaks
[38:41] that amen there you have it that is
[38:45] what's going to
[38:48] happen they'll go on with the church
[38:51] services already we know God is gone we
[38:54] already know it everybody knows it all
[38:57] of ministers knows it that God is not
[38:59] there
[39:01] so we need Scripture to back us up
[39:05] there's a
[39:06] quote and I brought out most of the
[39:10] scriptures
[39:12] on Saturday night
[39:16] in uh Dar to show you how God cuts off
[39:21] the holy ghost
[39:24] from the people so you have all those
[39:28] quotes to go with us quote and uh we
[39:31] write at the end it is finished you'll
[39:35] be sealed
[39:37] up with whatever you have I remember
[39:41] years
[39:42] ago brother Raymond Thompson used to
[39:44] like to say in our
[39:46] church be careful what you're
[39:49] doing whatever nonsense you catch on
[39:52] there's going to be a time that the Holy
[39:54] Ghost is going to seal that nonsense in
[39:56] you and you'll never be able to
[40:00] overcome and I want agree with that that
[40:05] is what is going to happen after
[40:08] Wednesday but as I said it already
[40:13] happened we see one another on Wednesday
[40:16] and then Saturday as
[40:18] well and uh we right at the
[40:21] end when the cup of the
[40:25] amorites Wednesday will be
[40:28] full and I'll tell you why I said it
[40:31] will be full God bless you thank you
[40:37] [Music]
[40:46] [Applause]
[40:50] [Music]
