[0:00] wild weather rages around the world do I
[0:04] think you know the end of the world's
[0:06] coming no I don't uh it's just it's it's
[0:10] just a weird feeling and it's all across
[0:12] our globe extreme weather of seemingly
[0:14] biblical proportions now a painful New
[0:18] Normal well it's been a week of extreme
[0:20] weather conditions and weather related
[0:23] disasters around
[0:25] the UN says this is a code red for
[0:28] Humanity and there is nowhere to hide
[0:31] I do not look for anything more than the
[0:35] signs of the coming of the Lord the
[0:39] biggest thing that must happen is
[0:42] climate change then the coming of the
[0:44] Lord are we watching without seeing
[0:47] what's going on are we not realizing
[0:51] that the climate is changing
[0:54] men will see that things are happening
[0:59] and if their eyes are closed they cannot
[1:03] see that it is transpiring right in
[1:08] front of them
[1:13] [Music]
[1:16] thank you
