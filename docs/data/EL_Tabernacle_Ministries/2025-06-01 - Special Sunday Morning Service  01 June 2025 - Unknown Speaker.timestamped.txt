[17:45] Amen. We can read
[17:49] Acts Acts 12:1.
[17:53] Amen. Acts 12. Amen. It says, "Now about
[17:57] that time, Herod the king stretched
[17:59] forth his hand to vex certain of the
[18:02] church, and he killed James the brother
[18:05] of John with a sword. And because he saw
[18:09] it pleased the Jews, he proceeded
[18:12] further to take Peter also." Then were
[18:15] the days of the unleaven bread. And when
[18:18] he had appre apprehended him, he put him
[18:22] in prison and delivered him to four
[18:26] portions of shoulders to keep him,
[18:28] intending after Easter to bring him
[18:30] forth to the people, but therefore was
[18:34] kept in
[18:35] prison, but prayer was made without
[18:39] ceasing of the church unto God for him.
[18:43] Like we are praying every Sunday. Amen.
[18:47] And when Herod would have brought him
[18:49] forth, the same night Peter was sleeping
[18:52] between two shoulders bound with two
[18:56] chains. And the keepers before the door
[18:59] kept the prison. And behold, the angel
[19:03] of the Lord came upon him. And the light
[19:06] shine in
[19:07] prison. And he smoked Peter on the one
[19:10] side and raised him up, saying, "Arise
[19:13] up quickly." and the chains fell from
[19:16] his hand. And the angel said unto him,
[19:18] "Guard thyself, and bind on thou's
[19:23] handles, and so he did." And he saith
[19:26] unto him, "Cast thy garment about thee,
[19:29] and follow
[19:30] me." And he went out and followed him.
[19:33] and worse note that it was true which
[19:36] was done by the angel. But though he saw
[19:39] a vision, when they were passed the
[19:43] first and the second w, they came unto a
[19:45] iron gate that leadth unto the city,
[19:48] which opened to them of of his own
[19:53] accord. And they went out and passed
[19:55] through the streets. And forth the angel
[19:57] departed from him. And when Peter was
[20:00] come to himself, he said, "Now I know of
[20:04] situ that the Lord have sent his angel
[20:07] and have delivered me out of the land at
[20:09] the hand of Herod and from the
[20:11] expectation of the people of the Jews."
[20:15] Amen. And the question is, Amen.
[20:19] Hallelujah. Yesterday we were free. We
[20:22] were put free. But what did make us
[20:24] free? Who did made us free? Amen. As we
[20:28] read also
[20:30] Deanomium 15 that the apostle read
[20:32] yesterday. At the end of every seven
[20:35] years thou shall make a release. And
[20:38] this is the manner of the release. Every
[20:40] creditor that landed out unto his
[20:43] neighbor shall release it. He shall not
[20:47] exect it from his neighbor for of his or
[20:51] of his brother because it is called the
[20:53] Lord's released. Amen.
[20:56] And we are released this morning. We are
[20:58] free this morning. That's why we are
[21:00] here to tune in. Amen. But the question
[21:04] is, Amen. Who released us? Who made us
[21:06] free? Praise the Lord. Amen. And there's
[21:09] one thing that I knew. Amen. It was not
[21:11] a man that freed Peter. Praise the Lord.
[21:14] But something freed him. Amen. But it
[21:16] was the angel of the Lord that came upon
[21:19] Peter. Amen. And last night, praise the
[21:22] Lord. It was not a man that freed us,
[21:24] but it was the angel of the pulpit,
[21:27] amen, that freed the people, amen. And
[21:30] that's why we can say we are free this
[21:32] morning. It was not a man's doing. Amen.
[21:35] But it was the angel of the Lord. Amen.
[21:38] And what I liked about this angel, he
[21:40] didn't just free Peter, but he walked
[21:42] with Peter. Amen. Hallelujah. That angel
[21:46] walked with Peter through the wats.
[21:48] Amen. Hallelujah. And when they came at
[21:50] the iron gate, Amen. Hallelujah. The
[21:53] iron gate opened themsself. Amen.
[21:55] Hallelujah. This is the time. Amen.
[21:58] Hallelujah. To walk with the angel of
[22:00] the Lord. Amen. After the chains fell
[22:03] off. Amen. After you are freed. Amen.
[22:05] Hallelujah. That's not not good enough.
[22:08] Amen. Hallelujah. There's an angel that
[22:10] wants to walk with you. Amen.
[22:12] Hallelujah. There's an angel that wants
[22:14] to take you out of prison. Amen. He
[22:17] don't just release you. He don't just
[22:19] set you free. Amen. Hallelujah. But he
[22:22] walks with you through the wars. Amen.
[22:24] He walks with you through the critics.
[22:26] Amen. Hallelujah. He walks through you.
[22:28] Amen. Through the prison houses. Amen.
[22:31] Until you are free in the streets. Amen.
[22:34] Hallelujah. So it was not a man
[22:37] yesterday. But it was the angel of the
[22:39] Lord setting us free. Amen. Hallelujah.
[22:43] It was like a vision yesterday. We
[22:46] couldn't understand it. It was like a
[22:48] dream. Amen. We couldn't understand it.
[22:52] Amen. Hallelujah. But when we realize,
[22:55] Amen. We are free this morning. Unless
[22:58] we came together this morning to worship
[23:01] Jesus, King God.
[23:04] Amen. Oh, hallelujah. We are free this
[23:07] morning. I just want to read Acts 16.
[23:10] Amen. 25.
[23:12] Amen. And at midnight, Paul and Silas
[23:16] prayed. Amen. Whenever there is
[23:18] something to be set free, it's just a
[23:20] prayer that's going out. Amen.
[23:22] Hallelujah. And this morning, we going
[23:24] to pray. Amen. At midnight, Paul and
[23:27] Silas prayed and they sang the praises
[23:30] unto God in the prisons and heard them.
[23:33] Amen. And suddenly there was a great
[23:36] earthquake so that the foundations of
[23:39] the prison were shaken. And immediately
[23:42] all the doors were open and everyone's
[23:46] band were loosened. Amen. Last night we
[23:49] started to sing. Amen. Last night we
[23:51] started to shout. Last night we started
[23:54] to praise Jesus King God. And it felt
[23:57] like a earthquake in here. Amen.
[23:59] Hallelujah. And the chains couldn't
[24:02] Hallelujah. handle that earthquake.
[24:04] Amen. The prison doors was not big
[24:07] enough. The iron doors was not big
[24:10] enough. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[24:13] Amen. And we were set free. Amen. We
[24:16] were set free last night. Amen. And I
[24:19] thank the Lord that I was here
[24:21] yesterday. Amen. Hallelujah. You cannot
[24:24] be set free if there is no angel of the
[24:27] Lord. There must be an angel. Amen.
[24:30] There must be an angel of the Lord on
[24:33] the earth. Amen. To set you free. Like
[24:36] Michael, Jesus, King God. When that
[24:38] angel come came on the earth and hang on
[24:41] Calvary, he set us free. You cannot be
[24:44] set free outside of the angel of the
[24:47] Lord. Whenever there's a exodus, there
[24:51] must be an angel, amen, to take the
[24:53] people out. Amen. Whenever there's
[24:56] exodus, Amen. When Moses came on the
[24:59] scene and he had his exodus to take the
[25:02] people out of Egypt. Amen. There was a
[25:04] angel in the land. had a burning bush
[25:08] experience. The angel was in the burning
[25:10] bush and the angel took the people out
[25:13] of Egypt. Amen. And when Moses couldn't
[25:16] go further, well, they exalted, Joshua
[25:19] took over. Amen. And there was the
[25:21] angel, the captain of the Lord's host.

[25:33] the premises. We're going to go home.

[27:16] [Music]
[27:18] When Daniel saw a vision of that, he
[27:21] said, "Though that they do wicked shall
[27:24] do wickedly in the last days, but they
[27:28] that know that God shall do exploits in
[27:31] the last days." Speaking of this time
[27:34] know what exploits is. Exploits of faith
[27:39] will perform signs and wonders, but the
[27:42] wicked will continue to do wicked. said
[27:46] they'll run to and through and knowledge
[27:49] shall increase but said close up the
[27:52] book. Oh Daniel, thou shalt sleep in thy
[27:56] lot but thou shalt stand in the last
[27:59] days. And they that be wise shall then
[28:02] turn many to Christ. They shall shine.
[28:05] Amen. As the stars in heaven forever and
[28:09] ever. Praise the Lord. That is what we
[28:11] shall do. Amen. We will be have great
[28:14] exploits. Amen. Because we will have the
[28:16] word of the Lord in our mouth. Amen.
[28:19] When the government is going to push us
[28:20] in a corner, when we don't know where to
[28:23] go. Amen. We will have thus sayeth the
[28:26] Lord. Amen. We will have great act do
[28:28] great exploits of
[28:32] faith, hearing and
[28:36] recognizing. Now it's promised in the
[28:38] last days God will pour out his spirit.
[28:41] is promised by Daniel that the people in
[28:43] the days when the stone hid the image of
[28:46] the foot. Amen. Oh, hallelujah. The
[28:49] people that know that God shall do
[28:51] exploits prophecy after prophecy. Amen.
[28:55] What prophecy in 6 months something will
[28:58] crack. Amen. Hallelujah. When that in
[29:00] the last days, Amen. the image will hit
[29:03] the food. Amen. Hallelujah. And all the
[29:06] seminaries, the world can't take it out.
[29:09] God's going to do it anyhow and God's
[29:13] and people's going to follow it. See the
[29:16] carnal and the natural church.
[29:18] Hallelujah. And the supernatural church.
[29:20] You see the word makes the difference.
[29:23] That's what Jacob taught. Amen. And no
[29:26] matter what, no matter what, I know I
[29:29] can never be blessed. And unless I get a
[29:32] hold of that birth, right? Amen. That
[29:35] birth right is what I'm going to have to
[29:39] get a hold
[29:43] of. Amen. That is what we need is the
[29:46] birthight. Amen. Because we're going to
[29:48] do exploits.
[29:50] Amen. That day on Calvary.
[29:55] Now notice greater works was to have the
[29:59] power in the church not only to heal the
[30:01] sick by prayer. Cast out devils by
[30:04] prayer but to impart the eternal life to
[30:07] the believers. The Holy Ghost was coming
[30:11] and given unto the hand of the church to
[30:15] impact impart life. That's what Calvary
[30:18] meant. He took, he stooped, regarded men
[30:22] and women and lifted them into a place
[30:25] to be sons and daughters of God to heal
[30:28] the sick and to impart eternal life by
[30:32] giving the Holy Spirit to be obedient
[30:35] believers. Men who were once unbelievers
[30:39] be made believers and impart spiritual
[30:42] eternal
[30:45] life. Amen. Hallelujah. So the Holy
[30:48] Ghost is not just here. Amen. I will
[30:50] heal our bodies. Amen. Hallelujah. But
[30:53] the angel of the pulpit. Amen.
[30:55] Hallelujah. He freed us. Amen.
[30:57] Hallelujah. And he impart eternal life.
[31:00] Amen. Hallelujah. It's not amen our
[31:03] bodies that is healed tonight. But he
[31:05] gave us eternal life. The supposed
[31:44] [Music]
[32:04] [Music]
[32:11] Oh, thank you. Amen. Hallelujah. That's
[32:14] why I'm so happy today. Amen. I have
[32:17] something more than a million dollars in
[32:19] Hallelujah. I don't have a million
[32:22] dollars, but I have eternal life. Amen.
[32:25] Hallelujah. And there's more than enough
[32:27] for me. That's good enough for me. Amen.
[32:31] Hallelujah. As I want to leave the last
[32:33] quote.
[32:37] Amen. And God expressed in Jesus Christ
[32:42] who was both father and son, holy ghost,
[32:45] the fullness of the godhead bodily. Now
[32:47] to the complete fullness of the godhead
[32:50] bodily dwells in the church. The
[32:53] preeeminence all that was he poured into
[32:56] Christ and all that was all in Christ
[33:00] was he poured into the church. The
[33:02] believer not a
[33:05] denomination. We'll get that in a few
[33:07] minutes. Everything that was in God, he
[33:11] poured into Christ. But everything was
[33:13] that was in Christ, he poured into me.
[33:17] And that's why we'll do exploits. And
[33:19] this morning, don't think about the
[33:23] possible. When you play, think about
[33:25] what's
[33:26] impossible. Think about the signs and
[33:29] the oneness. As we go
[33:33] [Music]

[33:40] together, pray Jesus King God.

[38:48] anything to our souls, Father. But Lord,
[38:51] we thank you this morning. We don't
[38:53] doubt this morning. We are believing
[38:56] this morning. While the world is getting
[38:58] themselves ready for big things, the
[39:01] world is getting themselves ready. We
[39:04] are also making ourself ready for good
[39:07] big things Lord for the prophet says
[39:10] Lord that once again Lord the world will
[39:14] hear directly from God. Amen. The bride
[39:18] has made us ready. God's apostle has
[39:22] preached something in us. God's apostle
[39:25] has put something in us. What did he put
[39:29] in us? The greater works. The greater
[39:32] works is not just to heal the sick but
[39:35] is to give eternal life, Father. And
[39:38] everyone that walked to that door
[39:40] received eternal life, heavenly father.
[39:44] And nothing can take that eternal life.
[39:47] Nothing can take that eternal life away
[39:49] from us. The Holy Ghost, what was the
[39:52] Holy Ghost sent for? The Holy Ghost was
[39:55] sent for to furtherance the work of God.
[39:58] And surely the work of God was
[40:01] furtherance. Hallelujah. And that Holy
[40:03] Ghost gave us eternal life. Uh
[40:06] hallelujah. And once again the bride of
[40:10] God, the church of God, the true
[40:13] believer will have the word of almighty
[40:16] God in his mouth. And Lord we can wait
[40:19] heavenly father to say let there be
[40:22] heavenly father when we can't receive
[40:25] nothing from the world. When the world
[40:28] won't give us anything, we will have
[40:30] something in us. Amen. Hallelujah. The
[40:33] prophet said, "Amen." Hallelujah. Wait
[40:35] till that day. Amen. When that little
[40:38] dog is pushed in a corner, when that dog
[40:41] is pushed in a corner, hallelujah.
[40:44] Praise the Lord. And that dog don't know
[40:46] which way to go. Then you will see the
[40:49] power that is in that dog. Amen. And one
[40:53] day, the pride will be pushed in the
[40:55] corner. Amen.
[40:57] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And when we
[41:00] are pushed in that corner, when we have
[41:02] a little squeeze, Amen. Hallelujah. That
[41:06] power will come out of us. Amen.
[41:09] Hallelujah. That Holy Ghost power that
[41:11] is in us that we think that isn't there,
[41:15] but is somewhere there. Amen.
[41:17] Hallelujah. There was nothing around
[41:19] God. There was nothing around him. He
[41:23] was there in his loneliness, in the
[41:25] darkness. Amen. Hallelujah. But there
[41:28] was something in him. There was a vessel
[41:31] of the Lord in him. And he said, "Let
[41:34] there be light." Amen. And one day when
[41:37] we don't know which way to go, when it's
[41:40] all dark around that mama, when there is
[41:43] no food in that cupboards, when there is
[41:46] no money on the table, when that mama is
[41:49] in the corner, that mama will only add
[41:51] one thing and is thus sayeth the Lord.
[41:55] Let there be. Amen. Hallelujah. We can
[41:59] wait, Lord. We know it's here, Lord.
[42:02] Hallelujah. Pastor Jonathan said,
[42:05] "Hallelujah. Pench yourself and see if
[42:08] you're not changing." Hallelujah. We are
[42:10] busy changing. Hallelujah. Nature can
[42:13] feel the change. The heavens can feel
[42:16] the change. So the church of Almighty
[42:19] God can feel the change. Amen.
[42:21] Hallelujah. Then we will do great
[42:24] exploits of faith. Uh we will do signs
[42:27] and wonders. We will speak limps into
[42:29] existence. The blind will see again. The
[42:33] couple will walk again. Death will be
[42:35] raised. And is already happened in El
[42:38] Tabernacle that the blinded eyes has
[42:41] opened. The bride will have great
[42:44] exploits of faith. Hallelujah. We're not
[42:47] scared this morning. As the apostle
[42:49] says, God had to take us the long way so
[42:53] we won't turn back. Hallelujah.
[42:55] Jupiteration. We don't turn back to
[42:58] Egypt. But you took us the long way. And
[43:01] yet, Lord, in the long way, we found
[43:04] something. We found the baptism of the
[43:07] Holy Ghost. We found the captain of the
[43:10] Lord's host. We found the angel of the
[43:12] Lord. And the angel of the Lord took us
[43:15] through Jordan. The angel of the Lord
[43:18] took us through the Red Sea. The angel
[43:20] took us through the Philistine and the
[43:23] Sedestine and all the enemies. He took
[43:26] us through. Amen. Hallelujah. When there
[43:29] was no water, he gave us water.
[43:33] Hallelujah. Oh, we thank you this
[43:36] morning. When when Samson fought the
[43:39] Philistines and after he fought, he was
[43:43] tired. He said, "Lord, are you going to
[43:45] let me die here?" Amen. And there the
[43:48] water came out of the ground. That is
[43:50] where we are. We are in a time of the
[43:53] supernatural because no church can move
[43:56] outside of the supernatural. We will
[43:59] have thus sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah.
[44:02] In a time where nothing, God don't care
[44:05] if it's the ground, whatsoever it is,
[44:07] the waters shall come out. And this
[44:10] morning, I am here. I am here. this
[44:13] morning not to do the impossible not to
[44:16] ask the impossible. What my five senses
[44:19] can do. No sir, we come from God.
[44:23] Hallelujah. We come from the impossible.
[44:26] Lord, I'm here to ask the impossible
[44:28] from you, Lord. We are Lord is the
[44:31] believer that will do exploits of faith.
[44:34] Amen. And what is a believer? A believer
[44:37] is when there is nothing. He believes
[44:39] there is something. And I don't care how
[44:42] far deep your children is in the world.
[44:45] I don't care how many people don't
[44:47] believe they can't come out of the
[44:49] prison house. A believer will say, "One
[44:52] day is one day, amen, me and my house
[44:55] will serve the Lord." A believer don't
[44:58] believe today and the next day he don't
[45:01] believe anymore. But the true believer
[45:04] is like Joshua that says, "Me and my
[45:07] house will serve the Lord."
[45:09] Joshua said, "I don't care how many
[45:12] giants is in the land. I don't care how
[45:14] big the walls are. I don't care, but I
[45:18] know my redeemer loveth. I know the
[45:21] walls must come down." Joshua asked for
[45:24] the impossible, and the impossible is
[45:27] here. We come out of the impossible.
[45:30] We're not asking, Lord, today for
[45:32] something that the five senses can get,
[45:35] but we ask something today. Hallelujah.
[45:38] that the six sense can get. We ask
[45:41] something today. We want to step into
[45:43] faith. Amen. And virtue and knowledge
[45:47] and temperance and patience and
[45:49] godliness and godly kindness and
[45:52] charity. The baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:55] and want to go into impossible. What we
[45:58] think our hands can reach. There is
[46:00] another hand that can reach it is the
[46:03] hand of almighty God. Amen.
[46:07] We don't care the iron pass. We don't
[46:10] care the shackles on our feet. Uh we
[46:13] don't care this morning. We don't care
[46:16] this morning. The angel of the Lord is
[46:19] in our months. The angel of the Lord is
[46:22] in the camp. The angel of the Lord is
[46:25] with us. The angel of the Lord is with
[46:27] this people. The angel of the Lord is
[46:30] here. The angel of the Lord is here. The
[46:34] angel of the Lord is here. The angel of
[46:37] the Lord
[46:38] is
[46:41] hallelujah.
[46:43] Hallelujah.
[46:52] Hallelujah. Why don't you open your
[46:54] mouth speaking? You have so much faith.
[46:58] You can speak your own world into
[47:01] existence.
[47:02] so much of the Holy
[47:04] Ghost and you got one love on it. When
[47:08] nobody can find you, when no problem can
[47:11] find you. Why don't you tell that
[47:14] mountain to move? Why don't you tell
[47:17] that river to open and walk my brother
[47:20] and walk my sister and walk my brother?
[47:26] This is the time to deliver. Whenever
[47:28] the angel of the Lord is there, the
[47:31] people are delivered. The people are set
[47:33] free. The people are set free. We are
[47:37] set free out tabernacle. We have been
[47:40] released. We have been released. We have
[47:43] been released. We have been released. We
[47:47] are set free. Our souls are free. Our
[47:51] children are free. The ministries are
[47:54] free. Everything is free. Hallelujah.
[47:57] Nothing can bound you. Why don't you
[47:59] take it? Whatsoever it is, your hands is
[48:03] open. Your hands is free. Take that
[48:06] drop. Your hands is free. Whatsoever you
[48:09] need, you take it this morning. You go
[48:12] into it. Doesn't care how many
[48:14] Philistines you go into that land. You
[48:18] go into your land. You know what is the
[48:21] difference between the people outside
[48:23] there and you? The difference is you are
[48:26] in El Tabernacle. The difference between
[48:29] the people there you walk and you you
[48:32] are in tabernacle. You are walking with
[48:36] angel. You are walking with
[48:39] angel. We are walking with
[48:42] angel. Lord don't leave us Lord. Lord
[48:46] you said you will never leave us. You
[48:48] will never forsake us. You will never
[48:51] leave us, Lord. You'll never forsake us.
[48:55] This is the time for the angel to be
[48:58] seen. For 400 years, there was no
[49:02] angel. 400 years they were nothing. But
[49:06] when the exodus start, he has stepped
[49:09] the angel forth. And Lord is our exodus.
[49:13] We're going to leave this place, Lord of
[49:15] Texas. We got to leave this world
[49:18] Lord. And when we leave this world,
[49:22] there must be angel leading
[49:25] us. There must be an angel.
[49:32] [Music]
[49:53] This church is not a church for the
[49:55] possible. If you can do it, it's fine.
[49:58] Do it. But Lord, I can't do nothing
[50:03] [Music]
[50:10] wrong. Lord, I can do nothing,
[50:13] Lord. Jesus said, I can do nothing over
[50:17] that. What my father has showed me,
[50:20] Lord, we can do nothing, Lord. Lord, we
[50:24] tired to do things, Lord. We tired,
[50:26] Father. Give up, Lord. We can't do
[50:29] nothing,
[50:31] Father. We can't do anything,
[50:34] Lord. Lord, we give up,
[50:38] Lord. Lord, we give up, Father.
[50:44] And Lord, we know when we give up, when
[50:47] you stop trying to do something, when we
[50:50] stop trying, Lord, still to do something
[50:54] is where you come in,
[50:57] Lord.
[51:01] Hallelujah.
[51:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. My
[51:10] [Music]
[51:13] Lord.
[51:18] Hallelujah. Glory. Your word. Glory.
[51:22] [Music]
[51:43] We can't save ourselves how we need to
[51:46] save
[51:47] [Music]
[51:56] us. Lord, if there's somebody here
[52:00] that the doctors gave up, they said they
[52:03] can't do nothing. Lord, there is where
[52:06] you come in, Lord. Where the hands, they
[52:08] throw their hands in the air. They say
[52:11] this young man will never come right.
[52:14] They throw their hands in the
[52:17] air. When they say are so sick, they
[52:19] can't do nothing for you. When they
[52:22] throw their hands in the
[52:25] air, they can't do nothing. Is when you
[52:29] step in,
[52:30] Lord. It's when you change our lives,
[52:32] Lord. is when you healed us, Lord. It's
[52:36] when you delivered us, Lord. And Lord,
[52:39] since you delivered us, you kept us,
[52:41] Lord. Lord, we never turn back, Lord.
[52:44] You kept us, Lord. You kept us, Lord.

[53:07] me. You kept me, Lord. It's me, Lord. In
[53:10] the need of pray, Lord. I need you so
[53:13] much, Lord. I need you more than
[53:15] anything. Lord, it's not my blood. It's
[53:18] not my sister. Lord, but it's me
[53:21] standing in the middle of Lord. I'm
[53:24] nothing. Lord, this church is only me.
