[1:35:45] is accepted in this world
[1:35:49] and the world to come
[1:35:54] [Applause]
[1:35:55] because
[1:36:01] he never prayed
[1:36:04] to God to forgive him
[1:36:07] send his sons
[1:36:10] because he never sent these garbage
[1:36:18] and how are you gonna know you love him

[1:36:50] keep my word

[1:37:13] and if you keep those Commandments
[1:37:18] brother Branham told you to do it don't
[1:37:21] only read the quotes
[1:37:23] don't only quote the word
[1:37:27] we're not only hearers of the world
[1:37:30] we are doers of the word
[1:37:40] if he says
[1:37:43] renewable the new birth is a mess
[1:37:49] you don't worry about your pompadoo
[1:37:54] you don't worry
[1:37:57] about your Liz Taylor's perfume
[1:38:07] if he slays me
[1:38:10] and I get up there
[1:38:14] and I look a mess
[1:38:17] let me look amazing
[1:38:23] as long as I'm

[1:38:46] how do you know that he loves you now
[1:38:49] you know
[1:38:52] when you keep the word then you love him
[1:38:55] but how do you know
[1:39:01] how does he love you
[1:39:05] if he'll
[1:39:07] if he gives you the Holy Ghost
[1:39:10] it's a gift

[1:39:34] then he loves you
[1:39:39] he doesn't give it to anybody it's a
[1:39:41] gift
[1:39:43] you don't give a gift to everybody
[1:39:53] [Applause]
[1:39:57] that's why
[1:39:58] [Applause]
[1:40:01] it's not everybody that has this gift
[1:40:14] foreign

[1:41:32] viewers
[1:41:38] across the world
[1:41:44] I
[1:41:46] they never knew about langa
[1:41:50] but since we came here
[1:41:53] the whole world knows about London
[1:42:04] [Applause]
[1:42:14] and I thank God for the um
[1:42:18] those pastors out in Brazil that also
[1:42:21] sent in
[1:42:25] I don't know they must have had an
[1:42:27] interpreter there
[1:42:30] because every time
[1:42:34] they just say
[1:42:36] Gloria's
[1:42:38] [Applause]
[1:42:54] so we want to thank
[1:42:57] so many people that has
[1:43:00] I remember it's not the LT of an echo
[1:43:03] because we had services in every Church
[1:43:07] we're out of an equally so they were in
[1:43:09] church
[1:43:12] this is outside people
[1:43:14] [Applause]
[1:43:23] no one is saying
[1:43:26] if anybody in Cape Town
[1:43:29] would like to counter that I spoke last
[1:43:32] night
[1:43:33] I mean it's not my words it's brother
[1:43:36] branham's words
[1:43:38] [Applause]
[1:43:45] if they do count it
[1:43:48] you just
[1:43:49] urge me
[1:43:51] to come back again
[1:43:54] and straighten out
[1:44:10] but it will only be a fool
[1:44:14] that tries to come up against
[1:44:18] those quotes were laid down last night
[1:44:28] they can only do one thing
[1:44:30] [Applause]
[1:44:31] is repent
[1:44:34] and obey the quotes
[1:44:36] [Applause]
[1:44:40] that's why
[1:44:43] that's why I am not
[1:44:45] concerned when the people says well we
[1:44:48] got the word we got the word
[1:44:50] fine everybody's got the word even
[1:44:53] Rome's got all the tapes
[1:44:55] they all say have the word
[1:44:57] the devil also has the word in Matthew
[1:45:00] 4.
[1:45:03] 3
[1:45:05] when he quoted back
[1:45:07] to the word
[1:45:09] the word
[1:45:11] everybody's not aware
[1:45:14] that's why I tell you
[1:45:17] this year
[1:45:20] the word
[1:45:22] is dead
[1:45:25] this word was in the beginning
[1:45:28] so let them preach in the beginning the
[1:45:31] word
[1:45:32] but we preached before the beginning
[1:45:34] [Applause]
[1:46:02] you're going to have a life first
[1:46:07] before the baby talk he needs to be
[1:46:10] alive
[1:46:12] and after
[1:46:15] a couple of months
[1:46:18] when his brain
[1:46:20] starts developing through his Spirit the
[1:46:24] brain is Spirit
[1:46:25] [Applause]
[1:46:27] than when the spirit is developed then
[1:46:30] the word come
[1:46:34] [Applause]
[1:46:40] so don't be taken up with people that
[1:46:43] speak about
[1:46:45] the word the word the word they don't
[1:46:48] even know what they're talking about
[1:46:56] [Applause]
[1:47:00] and then after
[1:47:04] your brain is developed your spirit is
[1:47:07] developed
[1:47:09] and you know because
[1:47:11] a word is a thought to express
[1:47:15] spirit
[1:47:16] where
[1:47:18] the spirit expresses the word
[1:47:22] if there's no spirit
[1:47:25] and the guys in saying he can't speak a
[1:47:29] proper word
[1:47:32] he misplaces the word
[1:47:35] because his spirit is deranged
[1:47:42] that's why if they misplace the word
[1:47:46] that means their spirit is deranged
[1:47:50] they matter
[1:47:53] misplaced dislocate
[1:47:58] [Applause]
[1:48:10] already preached
[1:48:13] already praised
[1:48:17] [Applause]
[1:48:27] the real world
[1:48:30] Jesus Christ right
[1:48:33] is Jesus the word
[1:48:37] and he only started to talk
[1:48:40] preach when he was 33 years old
[1:48:44] but he had to spread it all the time
[1:48:46] with him
[1:48:48] [Applause]
[1:49:01] amen
[1:49:04] I didn't touch my message so I'm going
[1:49:07] to try and touch it today
[1:49:15] [Applause]
[1:49:18] so let us just read
[1:49:22] the word of God in numbers again
[1:49:31] and what a blessing we had
[1:49:35] if you have given your heart to the Lord
[1:49:38] last night
[1:49:40] we
[1:49:42] we will be over anxious
[1:49:45] to baptize you
[1:49:48] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:53] over anxious
[1:49:55] and we welcome you in this family
[1:49:59] [Applause]
[1:50:04] numbers
[1:50:08] 13.
[1:50:12] and they came unto the brook of ashko
[1:50:16] and cut down from things a branch
[1:50:21] with one cluster of grapes
[1:50:25] and they bear it between two upon a
[1:50:30] staff
[1:50:33] they put a
[1:50:36] a pole between
[1:50:40] the classical grapes
[1:50:50] how could they miss it
[1:50:58] I wonder that just that one cluster of
[1:51:02] grapes
[1:51:03] how much wine does it make
[1:51:07] God is telling Israel now
[1:51:11] I am
[1:51:13] going to make you drunk when you come
[1:51:15] into the land
[1:51:16] [Music]
[1:51:19] [Applause]
[1:51:23] God hates
[1:51:26] a sober Church
[1:51:30] a sober Church you're always as splits
[1:51:33] because the guys
[1:51:36] use the coconut
[1:51:38] to try and catch you
[1:51:40] but a drunk guy is just happy
[1:51:45] you just want the grapes that's all
[1:51:49] [Applause]
[1:51:53] can you see how the natural types the
[1:51:56] spiritual
[1:51:58] this quote is in the natural
[1:52:01] and in Acts 2 is the spiritual
[1:52:05] there the wine came down
[1:52:11] so how can they say the in the land
[1:52:14] and they sober
[1:52:19] can't be
[1:52:26] two guys said to me to carry it
[1:52:30] two guys the old in the New Testament
[1:52:34] will be governed by the grapes
[1:52:49] and they brought off the pomegranates
[1:52:52] and are fixed
[1:52:54] father I thank you for the reading of
[1:52:56] your word
[1:52:58] I hand this word into your hands
[1:53:01] I pray that you'll give me strength
[1:53:05] and a sound mind
[1:53:07] to preach
[1:53:09] this morning
[1:53:11] I'm so happy that I could work for you
[1:53:13] Lord
[1:53:15] so happy that you chose me to work
[1:53:19] father I am even more
[1:53:24] happy and glad and joyous
[1:53:29] that I can see I'm not doing God a
[1:53:31] service
[1:53:33] without being his will or his word
[1:53:39] the fruits
[1:53:42] of the work
[1:53:44] is hanging on the tree in front of
[1:53:46] everybody
[1:53:50] I hand over this leading into your hands
[1:53:53] and I pray o God that you'll bless your
[1:53:55] people
[1:53:57] when I was a young man I asked you
[1:54:01] help me to help your people
[1:54:04] the Lord
[1:54:05] for 57 years you helped me
[1:54:08] and I could help your people
[1:54:13] pray that you'd undertake for me
[1:54:16] in Jesus name you may be seated
[1:54:30] amen
[1:54:33] the fruit of the land
[1:54:36] and I'd like to start where I finished
[1:54:39] off last night
[1:54:41] with a quotation that I told you I love
[1:54:43] this quotation so very much
[1:54:46] the uncertain sounds
[1:54:48] I even print little
[1:54:50] cards and gave it to the church
[1:54:53] I told them if you go out and you visit
[1:54:56] other churches
[1:54:58] you want to know
[1:55:00] whether the church is the right Church
[1:55:03] then that church will have
[1:55:06] this quote manifested
[1:55:09] if it's not this quotation then you're
[1:55:13] in the wrong place
[1:55:14] look for the church that's got this
[1:55:18] and I just want the El Tabernacle
[1:55:21] have you got this
[1:55:25] [Applause]
[1:55:29] because you said
[1:55:31] every time God has a church it'll be
[1:55:34] this type of a church
[1:55:36] was the Pentecostal Church a noisy
[1:55:39] Church
[1:55:43] positive don't care
[1:55:45] [Applause]
[1:55:47] amen and out of an echo
[1:55:50] I hate a sober person in the church
[1:55:53] I like a person that forgets about
[1:55:55] himself
[1:55:56] [Applause]
[1:56:00] we don't have a boring Church
[1:56:03] we don't get bored here
[1:56:06] why because life
[1:56:08] is emotions
[1:56:11] is that right is that what brother Brown
[1:56:13] says
[1:56:14] so if you have the life of Jesus Christ
[1:56:16] in your life
[1:56:18] then you'll be full of emotions
[1:56:21] you can't help but praise the Lord
[1:56:24] you can't help but have prayed through
[1:56:27] meetings
[1:56:28] you can't help but have a fasting and a
[1:56:32] prayer
[1:56:33] you can but help amen dance in front of
[1:56:37] your critics
[1:56:39] even if your neighbor is in the church
[1:56:42] she'll be shocked how you act in church
[1:56:45] if we have Baptist people they'll be
[1:56:48] shocked because this quote says every
[1:56:51] time God has a church it'll be this type
[1:56:55] of a church
[1:56:58] Cape Town there's nothing you can do if
[1:57:01] your church is not this type of a church
[1:57:03] you are in the wrong Church you better
[1:57:06] get to a church that has these Karl Marx
[1:57:10] amen where people is free and the Holy
[1:57:15] Ghost comes down he that the spirit sets
[1:57:18] free is free indeed we know more back
[1:57:22] then the Baptist amen we're in the
[1:57:25] Pentecostal age
[1:57:27] [Applause]
[1:57:37] thank you
[1:57:47] if the bishop said if the bishop says if
[1:57:52] the bishop says if the bishop brother
[1:57:54] Beckett says anything else brother
[1:57:58] Branham says he's a liar because this
[1:58:01] quote has no uncertain sounds amen
[1:58:05] that's called it's got a real sound
[1:58:07] because they came a sound from heaven
[1:58:12] like a rushing Mighty Winder amen and
[1:58:15] his sound like this quote
[1:58:19] I hear in this quote
[1:58:22] I want to tell you yes you are in this
[1:58:26] quote then let us rejoice and be glad
[1:58:30] for the lamb has made herself ready the
[1:58:34] spirit and the bride say come amen
[1:58:37] [Applause]
[1:58:39] [Music]
[1:58:39] [Applause]
[1:58:49] [Music]
[1:58:52] then he says they all says well don't
[1:58:55] worry we've got the Holy Ghost we you
[1:58:58] know they preach on the Holy Ghost and
[1:59:00] they think that's all right to preach on
[1:59:01] the Holy Ghost but this quote knock
[1:59:03] everybody out he says if you say you got
[1:59:07] it if you say you got it the Bible
[1:59:10] Tabernacle says they've got it your
[1:59:13] brother Beckett says they've got it amen
[1:59:16] this is the evidence
[1:59:19] and the proof and the manifestation that
[1:59:24] you got it watch that brother bam says
[1:59:27] and you didn't act like that like what
[1:59:31] like the first church
[1:59:33] then how did the first church Act they
[1:59:36] spoke in pounds they danced they shouted
[1:59:40] [Applause]
[1:59:49] can you say Amen
[1:59:57] foreign
[2:00:02] act like that then there's something
[2:00:05] wrong with you
[2:00:07] there's something wrong there's
[2:00:09] something wrong with the bishop
[2:00:12] if you preach on the Holy Ghost and the
[2:00:14] people don't act like that then there's
[2:00:15] something wrong with him that's what the
[2:00:18] prophet says and I say what the prophet
[2:00:20] says
[2:00:21] so if the man preached on the Holy Ghost
[2:00:23] and say you've got the Holy Ghost and
[2:00:25] they never acted like that because
[2:00:27] brother pranam says that's the way Jesus
[2:00:29] acted
[2:00:31] he said Jesus acted that way
[2:00:34] amen so why don't they act that way
[2:00:37] but El Tabernacle you will act that way
[2:00:42] why because Jesus act that way
[2:00:46] why because Jesus is in you
[2:00:50] and if Jesus is in you you'll act that
[2:00:53] same way no other way no other baptism
[2:00:56] there's only one baptism and there's a
[2:01:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[2:01:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost is full of
[2:01:05] emotions brother pronounces
[2:01:10] foreign
[2:01:13] [Music]
[2:01:20] [Music]
[2:01:20] [Applause]
[2:01:41] that's exactly what it said what what
[2:01:44] said
[2:01:47] that's what the Bible says not Bible
[2:01:50] Tabernacle not brother Beckett with his
[2:01:53] Baptist manners
[2:01:54] the Bible says it's a Pentecostal
[2:01:58] Menace because Pentecost started without
[2:02:03] an end and it's going on here because
[2:02:07] it's unto you and to your children and
[2:02:11] your children's children amen as many as
[2:02:15] the Lord called here is as many as the
[2:02:19] Lord called and we are acting the same
[2:02:22] way we are in the Bible this is the
[2:02:26] Bible
[2:02:27] amen we don't quote it we live it
[2:02:36] foreign
[2:02:44] [Music]
[2:02:50] [Applause]
[2:03:01] then the question comes up
[2:03:05] then what is the Holy Ghost
[2:03:11] you know now without it
[2:03:17] he doesn't know you
[2:03:19] they that don't have the spirit
[2:03:22] is none of Jesus
[2:03:25] none
[2:03:27] none
[2:03:30] but now if we have it
[2:03:33] [Applause]
[2:03:35] we need to know what
[2:03:37] how you're going to get it
[2:03:40] [Applause]
[2:03:43] the world is again falling apart
[2:03:46] and boy is it falling apart
[2:03:49] not even the world
[2:03:51] the churches is falling apart
[2:03:53] not even the churches the message is
[2:03:56] falling apart
[2:04:00] not even a message the foolish virgins
[2:04:02] is falling apart
[2:04:04] [Applause]
[2:04:05] but not the bride
[2:04:10] that has the oil
[2:04:13] the oil
[2:04:15] the oil
[2:04:17] make sure you've got the oil
[2:04:28] now instead of having to pick up the
[2:04:30] having preachers
[2:04:31] we've got lecturers
[2:04:33] man knows the word they know the word
[2:04:35] that's why I told you don't come to tell
[2:04:37] me where you got the word the word but
[2:04:39] otherwise it says the man's got a word
[2:04:41] another place he says this morning
[2:04:43] everybody is preaching the word
[2:04:47] so we passed the stage of the word
[2:04:51] we're at the stage of fulfilling the way
[2:04:54] [Applause]
[2:04:57] we passed the stage where the word was
[2:05:00] on paper
[2:05:03] we write now in the paper is turned into
[2:05:05] flesh
[2:05:07] and the word became flesh
[2:05:10] brother Brahm says your place
[2:05:12] that quote is in your flesh if that
[2:05:15] quote say dance and you dance that quote
[2:05:18] is in your flesh it's been made manifest
[2:05:23] [Music]
[2:05:49] it says
[2:05:50] they can sit there and put it together
[2:05:53] in such a way that it's astounding how
[2:05:57] they can do it
[2:05:58] they know the mechanics
[2:06:04] Ethel knows the mechanics
[2:06:07] brother Beckett knows the mechanics
[2:06:10] but then that ain't the Dynamics
[2:06:14] the mechanics
[2:06:16] the word
[2:06:18] that's not the Dynamics
[2:06:20] it's a mechanics
[2:06:26] what does he say can you read it for me
[2:06:31] we want
[2:06:36] not the word
[2:06:38] because he's a prophet
[2:06:40] you already lay down the word
[2:06:42] so you don't want the word
[2:06:44] you want the mechanics
[2:06:47] to go with the Dynamics
[2:06:49] or you want the Dynamics to work in the
[2:06:52] mechanics because the mechanics is there
[2:06:55] I don't have to prove the mechanics
[2:06:57] brother Branham already proved the
[2:06:59] mechanics I need the Dynamics to make
[2:07:02] the mechanics move to actually switch on
[2:07:06] the car and because
[2:07:11] all right
[2:07:18] you ought to shout the truth down you
[2:07:22] ought to run around this bowling that
[2:07:25] God gave you the Dynamics to go with the
[2:07:28] mechanics and make it pleasure again
[2:07:31] that you can walk with the word amen and
[2:07:35] talk with the word it has become the
[2:07:39] Dynamics of God we need the Dynamics and
[2:07:43] if the spirit of Jesus dwells in you
[2:07:46] it's gonna Quicken your mortal body and
[2:07:50] the Rapture will go
[2:07:58] oh my God
[2:08:10] now you
[2:08:12] now you
[2:08:14] finish this quote for me
[2:08:17] you finish this quote for me

[2:08:37] third dimension of hell
[2:08:41] [Applause]
[2:09:09] foreign
[2:09:11] [Music]
[2:09:13] [Applause]
[2:09:42] my mind couldn't grasp it that a great
[2:09:47] prophet like that one of the greatest
[2:09:50] outside Jesus Christ could stand up and
[2:09:54] say a thing like that I don't care about
[2:09:57] the Bible
[2:09:59] the mechanics
[2:10:01] [Applause]
[2:10:03] now if he don't care I don't care
[2:10:06] brother Beckett
[2:10:09] because I had it for 57 years I know it
[2:10:12] I know the mechanics
[2:10:15] and nobody can tell me about the
[2:10:17] mechanics I know the mechanics
[2:10:20] everybody knows the mechanics this
[2:10:23] morning in the churches even the Roman
[2:10:26] Catholic Church they're going to open
[2:10:28] the Bible and read the mechanics
[2:10:31] but don't sit there they'll have the
[2:10:34] mechanics but they cannot have the
[2:10:36] dynamic say man we need the dynamic
[2:10:40] Hallelujah and what do you need Hey
[2:10:43] Brother Branham says he wants to know
[2:10:45] the Dynamics how come you don't want to
[2:10:48] know it brother Beckett amen I want to
[2:10:51] know it
[2:10:53] because I want to be like the prophet
[2:11:00] [Music]

[2:32:34] [Applause]
[2:32:48] give me the next one
[2:32:51] the token
[2:32:53] listen here now the token the Dynamics
[2:32:58] but Israel
[2:33:01] any Bible student knows
[2:33:03] that Israel was a type of the church
[2:33:05] exactly
[2:33:07] to the promised land
[2:33:10] and that's where she is turning to to
[2:33:12] the promised land
[2:33:14] if Ten Commandments and uh and Mount
[2:33:17] Sinai and and pull off fire and pull off
[2:33:22] cloud and uh
[2:33:24] the rock giving the war to all that is
[2:33:27] all right but that was just the journey
[2:33:29] to get to the promised land
[2:33:33] [Applause]
[2:33:35] The Ten Commandments was only the
[2:33:38] journey
[2:33:39] to get to the promised land
[2:33:42] now they still in
[2:33:44] in the journey
[2:33:47] we have crossed over in 1979
[2:33:51] did you hear me
[2:33:54] we crossed over 1979.
[2:33:57] [Applause]
[2:34:09] they saw what justification
[2:34:11] sanctification justification said we in
[2:34:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:34:17] as he says underscore
[2:34:19] [Applause]
[2:34:21] [Music]
[2:34:22] but when the evening time comes
[2:34:24] Wednesday evening time now
[2:34:27] and the journey was on
[2:34:29] there was one solemn requirement
[2:34:32] one
[2:34:33] after all that
[2:34:36] after having Moses the Ten Commandments
[2:34:39] the Smith and Rock Amen the raising of
[2:34:43] the serpent for healing in the
[2:34:45] wilderness after all that amen mounts
[2:34:49] and I after all that the cloud after all
[2:34:54] that the pull of fire after all that
[2:34:57] amen there's one requirement after all
[2:35:01] that after Moses there's one requirement
[2:35:04] one
[2:35:15] how many requirements
[2:35:19] no matter how much Jew he had been
[2:35:22] regardless of how he says I'm the bride
[2:35:24] I mean yeah brother says there's brides
[2:35:27] and brides and he bride
[2:35:31] regardless if you're a Jew
[2:35:35] how well you had kept his crops
[2:35:39] how well he had taken care of the
[2:35:42] neighbors
[2:35:43] how much he had done
[2:35:46] how good a member he was good Amendment
[2:35:49] Church I stick with brother
[2:35:52] back as you know
[2:35:57] and also go to hell
[2:35:59] with brother Beckett
[2:36:01] without the Holy Ghost
[2:36:04] God has no friends when it comes to the
[2:36:07] Token he even wanted to kill brother
[2:36:09] brainer
[2:36:11] took his wife took his shoulder and all
[2:36:13] that and who's Brother Beckett
[2:36:16] and brother Branham just sympathized
[2:36:21] with a Baptist Doctrine
[2:36:24] not preaching the weapon of the back of
[2:36:26] preaching
[2:36:28] hot what a chance does he spend when he
[2:36:31] dies
[2:36:34] no chance
[2:36:38] God can keep me accountable for that I
[2:36:41] can't see brother Brandon being stroked
[2:36:44] and really nailed down
[2:36:47] twice
[2:36:49] for rejecting the Holy Ghost not
[2:36:51] rejecting it but compromising with his
[2:36:54] mother-in-law
[2:36:55] the other time God straightened him out
[2:36:58] is when he those Pentecostals came into
[2:37:01] the church and it started to dance with
[2:37:03] the tambourine and all that and brother
[2:37:05] Branham says well you know where I come
[2:37:07] from
[2:37:08] I was Baptist
[2:37:10] I don't believe in this
[2:37:12] they're making my church a Tavern
[2:37:15] I'm coming to that
[2:37:18] and God says what
[2:37:21] are you sitting in the seat of a
[2:37:22] scornful Branham
[2:37:23] [Music]
[2:37:24] [Applause]
[2:37:30] he rebuked him twice
[2:37:32] [Applause]
[2:37:34] because brother Abraham's first a part
[2:37:37] of his ministry was baptized against
[2:37:39] Sensations against uh
[2:37:43] uh uh uh the the dancing he says I was
[2:37:47] against it
[2:37:48] I didn't like it
[2:37:50] emotions he was against it that was his
[2:37:53] first part of his ministry he came out
[2:37:55] with the Baptist idea
[2:37:59] and all those quotes in the beginning
[2:38:00] was Baptist but at the end when he asked
[2:38:04] to be the Elijah of Malachi 4 yet to say
[2:38:07] Pinnacle starts without a name
[2:38:13] he had to change
[2:38:14] [Applause]
[2:38:23] no matter how much he had done how good
[2:38:25] a member he was how much titles tithes
[2:38:29] he paid
[2:38:30] all these things was fine
[2:38:32] that was okay he was a good man
[2:38:35] recognized amongst his people as a good
[2:38:38] man
[2:38:39] but just read that
[2:38:50] so how is brother Becca going to make
[2:38:52] when brother Brown says
[2:38:54] without the Holy Ghost Shall Perish
[2:38:59] oh don't go to the Grave like that
[2:39:01] brother Becca
[2:39:03] you're going to have a pleasant surprise
[2:39:05] this quote is going to nail your height
[2:39:08] amen set the people free
[2:39:10] brother Roscoe you're an apostle of God
[2:39:12] straighten out the thing
[2:39:15] tell the people
[2:39:17] I'm in Cape Town and I'm telling you by
[2:39:20] the quotes
[2:39:21] [Applause]
[2:39:24] don't perish with them that is perishing
[2:39:28] get out from among my people and do not
[2:39:32] be partakers of their sin
[2:39:35] that's where the Holy Ghost is
[2:39:37] it's where the dancing is get away from
[2:39:41] them that's threatened by the word
[2:40:01] no
[2:40:03] how do you know
[2:40:06] you have got it
[2:40:10] palm oil
[2:40:11] locusts
[2:40:13] Cancun and caterpillar
[2:40:16] I think it's phase 30.
[2:40:20] listen what he says there is no place in
[2:40:23] the Bible
[2:40:25] where they ever receive the Holy Ghost
[2:40:27] without having emotions
[2:40:29] [Music]
[2:40:31] no place
[2:40:34] no place
[2:40:36] and they say we the word the word the
[2:40:38] word but brother Brahm says no place in
[2:40:41] the word where anybody ever received the
[2:40:45] Holy Ghost
[2:40:46] without emotions
[2:40:47] [Music]
[2:40:47] [Applause]
[2:41:01] so if you receive the Holy Ghost without
[2:41:03] emotions that means you've got another
[2:41:05] Holy Ghost
[2:41:06] but not this one
[2:41:08] not Malachi Falls Holy Ghost
[2:41:12] the only place that has this Holy Ghost
[2:41:14] is here Tabernacle

[2:44:09] quenching the Holy Ghost but in real
[2:44:12] Tabernacle quench him in to throw water
[2:44:15] on the Fire
