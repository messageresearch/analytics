[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] But you can't lie to me with all those
[0:16] spoken words. You don't
[0:18] [Music]
[0:23] live. I'm not trying to follow you to
[0:26] the end of the world.
[0:30] I'm just trying to leave something
[0:34] behind in the footprints of Jesus in
[0:41] God. Words have come from men. No
[0:47] Bible. Oh, but I can't help thinking
[0:50] that I heard the wrong
[0:53] crowd. When the Holy Ghost is gone, my
[0:57] job will be
[1:00] true. And I'm trying to leave something
[1:04] behind in the foot of Jesus.
[1:11] All the money is free but the holy
[1:21] go and the
[1:26] s is all to me.
[1:33] Oh, the future ahead is broken
[1:40] in something
[1:43] behind the
[1:49] Jesus. This whole world is a
[1:55] war. We follow the world, but we don't
[1:59] know why.
[2:02] We're running the case, but we
[2:09] got
[2:12] something in the footprints of Jesus.
[2:20] I believe we are at the wrong
[2:24] time and I
[2:31] cannot
[2:47] I don't There is a peaceful escape in my
[2:52] bra.
[2:54] You can put me
[2:59] there when the machine is taking the
[3:03] soul away.
[3:27] for the ceiling for
[3:31] me. It's so hard
[3:37] to
[3:47] f Heat. Heat.
[3:55] [Music]
[3:57] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[4:25] Oh
[4:36] somewhere those who
[4:42] It's time to leave something
[4:46] behind in the footprints of
[4:51] Jesus. Hold on my
[4:55] knees more
[4:56] [Music]
[5:02] than you.
[5:07] When my soul stands at his face
[5:12] [Music]
[5:14] statue, you will know what
[5:22] I was trying to leave something
[5:28] behind. I was trying to leave something
[5:32] behind.
[5:35] I was trying to
[5:37] something
[5:40] [Music]
[5:46] [Music]
[5:54] behind. I am
[5:58] uh glad that I could uh speak to
[6:04] especially my
[6:05] church eel tabernacle which God called
[6:09] me to be
[6:13] overseer look after his
[6:15] flock and
[6:17] uh
[6:20] I want to say like Paul saying I didn't
[6:24] um
[6:26] shun to
[6:28] declare all the councils
[6:32] of
[6:33] God and not only declare
[6:36] it but
[6:38] also manifest it, bring it to
[6:43] pass by the help and the grace of
[6:47] Almighty God.
[6:50] I would like just to
[6:53] pray and I didn't think it's going to be
[6:57] so quick that I have to put the clips
[6:59] out
[7:00] again because I'm trying to get away
[7:03] from it. But u major
[7:06] events
[7:08] requires major
[7:11] ministries to actually make sense. Like
[7:15] brother Brennham says in birth pains men
[7:18] will come behind me and make sense. And
[7:21] I'm glad that I could
[7:23] say in this late hour that I'm one of
[7:27] that men that has made sense to Malachi
[7:32] 4's
[7:34] prophecies and word as he has prayed
[7:38] over me, laid hands on me. I said, "This
[7:43] boy will preach exactly what I preach,
[7:46] which I did." And he declares and put a
[7:49] stamp on Revelations
[7:52] 10:8. So, I just like
[7:55] to say a
[7:58] prayer. Father, we come to you in the
[8:00] name of Jesus Christ. We know all is
[8:04] just the grace of God. And all is
[8:09] inspired by an angel that we can do
[8:13] nothing unless it's given from above,
[8:16] Lord. And Lord, we so glad that we
[8:20] could only line up
[8:23] behind your prophet that you send in an
[8:27] hour
[8:28] and make sense to the word that he
[8:32] brought seeing that he didn't have all
[8:35] the time that we had. And Father, I pray
[8:38] that you'd again just make
[8:43] sense to what you showed
[8:46] me and this whole thing in your hand
[8:51] because I cannot handle it. You actually
[8:55] is the one that wrote it inspired
[8:59] through a prophet and you said men will
[9:02] come behind it and make sense to it. And
[9:07] you said Revelations 10:8 will prophesy
[9:10] again. And Lord, what we're going to say
[9:14] is already said, but because you said it
[9:17] needs to be said
[9:19] again, we fulfill the scriptures in
[9:23] Jesus' name.
[9:25] Amen. Um, I would like to just take a
[9:28] scripture
[9:30] reading. Revelation
[9:33] 17 verse 5.
[9:36] And upon her head, forehead, was a name
[9:41] written, mystery Babylon the great, the
[9:45] mother of harlots, an abomination of the
[9:48] earth. It's a mystery that we're going
[9:52] to speak
[9:54] upon this
[9:55] evening. And I would like to take verse
[9:58] seven. And the angel said unto me,
[10:01] wherefore did thou marvel, John? Why did
[10:05] you marvel? I will tell thee the mystery
[10:08] of the woman and of the beast that carth
[10:11] her, which had the seven heads and 10
[10:16] horns. It's a
[10:18] mystery.
[10:20] And John
[10:24] marveled. He
[10:27] wondered. He actually couldn't grasp it.
[10:35] when he looked at this
[10:38] woman and
[10:40] um we would like
[10:42] to speak on
[10:46] this because everybody is
[10:49] silent and I cannot be silent because I
[10:53] can't help for who I am.
[10:56] If there
[10:59] was a
[11:01] newspaper, I would call it the newspaper
[11:04] of the new
[11:05] Jerusalem. The headlines of this
[11:09] newspaper of the new
[11:12] Jerusalem will actually be
[11:15] focused on the very
[11:17] hour and the time we living now.
[11:21] The headlines will be what I am going to
[11:25] talk on now nothing else because God's
[11:30] word comes in its season and its time
[11:34] and now we have come into the time
[11:38] zone of these scriptures to be
[11:42] fulfilled and we do not want our church
[11:46] to miss it.
[11:48] They must
[11:50] catch on not modern events made clear by
[11:55] prophecy but prophecy
[11:58] now is been cleared by modern events.
[12:03] So we are going into some beautiful
[12:10] things, scary
[12:13] things, marveling things that is playing
[12:17] right in front of us
[12:19] now because it's in the newspaper of the
[12:24] New Jerusalem
[12:26] Post, which is the Bible, the book of
[12:30] Revelations that is playing out in front
[12:33] front of us. So the first thing I would
[12:35] like to do is to play the
[12:39] clip that I spoke
[12:43] on
[12:45] these things that's going to
[12:48] happen way back in December
[12:53] uh
[12:55] 2024 where I made a statement
[13:00] but I feel That's right. That in the
[13:04] next six months,
[13:07] something is going to happen.
[13:14] For the next 6 months,
[13:19] hold
[13:21] on. Something is going to crack,
[13:25] but we will be walking in the
[13:28] light. God bless you.
[13:33] Now there is a
[13:35] mouthwatering
[13:40] prophecy
[13:42] in December 5 months
[13:45] ago and I must be honest I was looking
[13:49] at Revelations 13 as
[13:52] such at that specific time where the
[13:57] spirit showed me revelation 13 and
[14:00] that's why I say something is going to
[14:01] break and little I know something more
[14:04] is going to break.
[14:06] Now if this thing has broken the way it
[14:11] did I conclude this thing
[14:14] positively I don't know what made me say
[14:17] so I don't know what came over me but
[14:21] that's how prophecy works you know
[14:24] brother Raymond Thompson and them will
[14:25] tell you how many times did I
[14:28] prophesy he was there when I prophesied
[14:32] of sister Ba
[14:35] um Daniel's brother Alfie's wife that
[14:39] nobody
[14:41] thought when I prophesied it it could
[14:44] ever
[14:46] happen what she did and the Holy Ghost
[14:49] told me the whole
[14:51] thing and uh when we got to our house
[14:55] luckily Alfie wasn't there me and
[14:56] Raymond was there and I told her what
[14:59] the Holy Ghost told me and she went in
[15:01] made tea and came back and she said I
[15:03] just told my sister do this afternoon
[15:05] that um she told her that listen
[15:10] I not going to believe this man anymore
[15:13] if he doesn't know what I'm doing. He
[15:16] said and yet tonight you and brother
[15:17] Raymond came and told me what I'm doing.
[15:21] Raymond can tell you the story. Then he
[15:24] was also there when I said on a
[15:29] Wednesday night, let's go to a certain
[15:31] flat. We'll catch one of the elders
[15:35] there with the woman. He was there with
[15:38] that prophecy as well.
[15:40] Then he was there when I said let's go
[15:43] down to Clay Thorp and
[15:47] uh brother Fortain being the trustee and
[15:52] a treasurer down there that uh he is
[15:55] busy taking uh the tithe
[15:59] money and he went with me down there and
[16:01] it was just like that he knows of all
[16:04] those prophecies. I don't speak about
[16:06] even you know Baron whoms I'm I'm I'm
[16:08] telling you something that you don't
[16:09] know and even Solenica knows some of
[16:12] this prophecies that came to pass and uh
[16:16] that's why it makes El tabernacle an
[16:21] outstanding church amidst all the
[16:23] churches in the message because a stamp
[16:27] is put on here not only with the Holy
[16:31] Ghost and not only by preaching
[16:34] Not only by a gift, but
[16:37] prophecy has been
[16:40] fulfilled many a times. And here goes
[16:42] the prophecy out again. How many people
[16:46] was
[16:48] wondering what's going to happen? How
[16:51] could this guy get
[16:54] up right in December and say, "Well, in
[16:59] the next six
[17:00] months, something is going to break."
[17:05] And without
[17:07] sherking, without
[17:10] quavering, without being
[17:13] scared, say it
[17:16] twice. Now, it has come to pass. We're
[17:20] going to go into it and
[17:23] uh if that has come to pass then what
[17:26] about the rest what I said then al
[17:29] tabernacle you'll know that you are
[17:32] walking in the light.
[17:35] So brethren I cannot
[17:40] help for the fruit that's on the tree.
[17:43] Yeah, I think everybody has now seen
[17:46] what I said my prophecy for the next 6
[17:51] months and
[17:53] um there's people that's going around
[17:56] and say that I said in another 6 months
[17:59] Jesus is coming and especially brother
[18:02] Oils's family and I'm now sick and tired
[18:07] of brother
[18:09] uh Peter Majadi Buddhy
[18:15] um hitting us from behind all the time.
[18:19] I'm going to have a special meeting and
[18:21] I'm going to tell you what his name mean
[18:23] and I'm going to tell you who he is. I
[18:26] don't have time now to go into it but I
[18:29] want you El Tabernacle when you see him
[18:31] call him
[18:34] Maju. That's what you call him. And I'll
[18:37] tell you people that don't know what
[18:39] that mean. I'll tell you the meaning of
[18:41] it. Thank
[18:42] you. As they like to say, you can't
[18:45] change history. You know, this is
[18:48] history. You can't change it. It's been
[18:50] done and it's
[18:52] there. You either believe it or you
[18:54] don't believe it. So that's
[18:59] why I like to play the clip once again.
[19:04] But I feel
[19:07] that in the next six
[19:09] months something is going to happen
[19:13] [Music]
[19:18] for the next 6 months.
[19:22] Hold on.
[19:25] Something is going to crack,
[19:29] but we will be walking in the light.
[19:33] God bless you.
[19:36] And that I made out of the mouth of two
[19:40] witnesses. Let everything be
[19:42] established. That's why I said it twice.
[19:47] Now, Statue of a Perfect Man,
[19:50] page
[19:53] 6D. I would like to just read it for
[19:56] you. And I want to take it, Brother
[20:00] Brandham says, and study
[20:03] it and compare it and then act upon
[20:08] it. Don't just study it, compare
[20:12] it, but act upon it. When you do, take
[20:19] it sincerely to yourself. Don't say,
[20:22] "Well, I enjoyed listening at it. I did,
[20:26] too.
[20:27] But to listen at it and then receiving
[20:30] it is different. See, it's different.
[20:35] Now I want to say you compare this, you
[20:40] take it, you compare
[20:43] that, you act upon it. What I said
[20:48] within the next 6
[20:51] months, see if this is the word of God.
[20:56] If it isn't, then you know it's false.
[21:01] It needs to be chucked in the
[21:04] dustman and it is from the devil
[21:07] himself.
[21:09] But if it is after you took it, study
[21:14] it, compare it, act upon it, after you
[21:18] done all that and you find
[21:22] out that it is the truth, then you
[21:26] obligated to it and compare it and take
[21:31] it and act upon it and study it. then
[21:35] you compel to actually take it or
[21:38] otherwise you find yourself sinning.
[21:44] Now that
[21:46] is why I would like to bring in this
[21:51] quote out of the
[21:55] oddball which is
[21:58] 1963 the year he he preached the
[22:03] seals and speak about the spirit of
[22:08] truth. So this is truth then that's why
[22:12] he put it in this message the spirit of
[22:17] truth and it may be my going home may be
[22:21] my time to
[22:24] die in other
[22:26] words it looks very much that
[22:29] way it looks as if I'm going cuz after
[22:33] two years here he
[22:35] died if it
[22:37] is there will raise somebody after
[22:42] me that will take the message
[22:47] on. He'll be an odd
[22:51] person, but he'll rise after this after
[22:55] what? after brother
[22:57] Brandham and take the message on and you
[23:02] listen to it as long as as it's
[23:07] scripture stay with it stay after you
[23:12] compare it page 60 stay with it now I
[23:17] can't help for this quote brother
[23:19] Brandham says it and I
[23:23] believe that that odd ball is
[23:25] Revelations
[23:29] 10:8. He will come after brother
[23:32] Brandham, prophesy again what brother
[23:35] Brandham already said. And there is
[23:37] nobody that came after brother Brham and
[23:40] prophesied again and it
[23:43] happened. So
[23:46] this gets fulfilled every time. Every
[23:50] time.
[23:52] I like to take an exposition of the
[23:54] seven church ages with that
[23:58] quote. It says this age started after
[24:02] the turn of the 20th century as it was
[24:05] to be the age in which a true church
[24:08] would return to being the bride she was
[24:11] at Pentecost.
[24:13] We know that these must of necessity be
[24:16] a return of dynamical power which is the
[24:20] Holy Ghost dynamics. The believers
[24:23] sensed this in their spirits and began
[24:26] crying to God for a new outpouring such
[24:28] as was in the first century. What seemed
[24:32] to be the answer came as many began to
[24:36] speak in tongues and manifest gifts of
[24:38] the spirit. It was then believed that
[24:41] this was indeed the long awaited
[24:44] restoration. It was not. It wasn't. Why?
[24:51] For the letter rain can come only after
[24:53] the former rain. So the former rain has
[24:56] to come first. Now what's the former
[24:59] rain? Which is the
[25:02] spring or teaching
[25:06] rain? The teaching rain is a former
[25:08] rain. Then comes the letter
[25:11] rain. The letter rain then is the
[25:14] harvest
[25:16] rain. That's the last rain. How could
[25:19] this be the real thing when the teaching
[25:22] rain had not come? The teaching rain
[25:25] didn't come yet. Now watch what he says
[25:27] here. The prophet messenger who was to
[25:31] be sent to teach. Now who brought the
[25:34] teaching reign? The prophet who brought
[25:37] the word the teaching reign the prophet
[25:40] the prophet brought it and that's why I
[25:44] do not go in this time
[25:47] with brother Brandham says brother
[25:50] brenham says brother brenham says quote
[25:52] after quote trying to teach brother
[25:55] brenham already done it trying to prove
[25:58] the message it's already proven because
[26:01] the teaching reign has come already
[26:05] So we need something extra. That's why
[26:08] he says I don't care about the
[26:11] mechanics, the teaching reign, the push
[26:14] and play rain. That's past tense. That's
[26:19] gone. We're in another age. We're in
[26:22] another reign. Why? Because this is what
[26:25] he says. Why do we not have that? is
[26:30] because he says the prophet messenger
[26:33] who was to be sent to teach the people
[26:36] there's your teaching
[26:38] reign and turn the hearts. Then after
[26:42] teaching the word of God the former
[26:45] reign he turns around he says and turn
[26:49] the hearts of the children to the
[26:51] Pentecostal fathers had heath not come.
[26:55] So the latter rain had not come. The
[26:58] teaching reign came because the prophet
[27:00] came. But the letter rain didn't come
[27:02] yet. So there must be somebody that come
[27:05] after the prophet that will bring the
[27:08] letter rain. And it's been proven since
[27:11] 1979 right around the world who brought
[27:15] the letter
[27:17] rain. And um thus what was uh uh thought
[27:22] to be the restoration and the final
[27:24] quickening until the rapture had not
[27:27] come. So this final climax, the
[27:31] quickening power is actually preparing
[27:34] the people for the
[27:36] rapture. So here you got two direct
[27:39] quotes. If this didn't happen and
[27:42] brother Brandham was a false prophet
[27:44] this is two quotes that's in prophecy
[27:47] you know somebody will come and
[27:51] after the
[27:53] teaching reign comes the baptism of the
[27:58] Holy Ghost the token. Oh, I thank God
[28:02] that the world knows, Pentecost knows,
[28:05] everybody knows that this quote was
[28:09] fulfilled in South Africa in El
[28:12] Tabernacle. Now, you can stumble as much
[28:15] as you want to stumble. You can't prove
[28:17] it any other way. You can't argue fruit.
[28:20] You can't go against history. You can't
[28:23] go against a ministry that has proven to
[28:26] be the dynamics and mechanics together.
[28:30] The former and the letter rain together.
[28:33] The dynamics and the mechanics, the oil
[28:35] and the wine. Amen. Together it is in El
[28:40] Tabernacle and still
[28:42] Yeah.
[28:44] So I needed to bring that in for you to
[28:49] see what brother Brandham says. So you
[28:51] work it out with brother Brandham. I
[28:53] don't even want to speak about what he
[28:55] says. In every generation,
[28:57] uh, God sends a messenger and he's only
[29:01] responsible for his generation. And here
[29:04] I am really nearly 80 years old. I'm
[29:07] nearly two generations old, but he says
[29:10] his generation. So we two generations
[29:12] away from what brother Brandham has has
[29:15] has lived in. So somebody had to come. I
[29:20] wonder, didn't you miss him?
[29:23] Did you miss him? I am sure you did.
[29:27] Now, let's get into the
[29:29] thing. So much happened already in this
[29:32] six
[29:33] months. We're going to take two of the
[29:38] main events that's been in the
[29:41] Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem Post, which
[29:45] is the book of Revelation. That is our
[29:49] newspaper for this day and this hour. I
[29:53] make it the newspaper the main thing for
[29:57] this hour and this time that we live in.
[30:01] It's on the front pages of the heavenly
[30:04] newspapers which is the book of
[30:06] Revelation.
[30:08] So the Bible which is the word of God in
[30:12] Revelations
[30:13] 13 comes into play
[30:18] uh into play with the USA Revelations
[30:22] 13. He showed you his power of the beast
[30:27] just like the
[30:30] Bible
[30:32] says the power of
[30:37] Revelations
[30:40] USA. What it's got? Let's read it. And
[30:44] the beast which I saw was like unto a
[30:48] leopard, and his feet were as the feet
[30:51] of a bear, and his mouth as a mouth of a
[30:54] lion. And the dragon gave his power and
[30:59] his seed and great
[31:03] authority gave it
[31:06] over to who? To Rome. Revelation 17.
[31:13] There is your front page of the New
[31:19] Jerusalem
[31:20] post which is the book of Revelations 13
[31:24] and 17. That's on the front pages
[31:29] now. That is where we are living in now.
[31:35] So look at the power he's got. Look at
[31:37] the authority he's got. Now please
[31:40] remember this.
[31:43] that the power revelation 13's
[31:48] got. Look what he
[31:50] does when he came
[31:53] in. It's so
[31:56] strange that he came in within the six
[31:59] months. He got
[32:01] ordained in February month.
[32:05] Trump
[32:07] sworn in as president 20th
[32:12] January 2025. That's within the 6
[32:16] months. I said here he comes.
[32:18] Revelations 13. I call him Revelations
[32:21] 13. Here he comes in. Now remember I
[32:25] said don't miss it. Brother Brand speaks
[32:28] about a woman come out of some America
[32:31] being president or the Roman Catholic
[32:33] Church. And I said, "Could that be Trump
[32:36] from that time?" He says, "Or the
[32:40] Catholic
[32:42] Church." So here we see the sprinkling
[32:45] two women. A natural woman that will be
[32:49] voted
[32:51] in and a spiritual woman, which is the
[32:54] Roman Catholic Church, that's not voted
[32:57] in. She just comes in. But the natural
[33:02] woman that will be president, she gets
[33:05] voted in. So I never saw this just the
[33:08] other day and as I went through the
[33:11] quotes and all if you read
[33:15] really those quotes, you'll see he
[33:18] speaks every time of two
[33:20] women. That's
[33:22] why we have two candidates for the two
[33:26] women.
[33:28] One is Trump and the other one is
[33:31] Camila. One will be Cama that is voted
[33:35] in. So far we see how our votes
[33:38] went. The other one might be Trump that
[33:41] will let the Roman Catholic Church come
[33:44] in because of the
[33:47] pressure of the Roman Catholic
[33:50] Church. Because America owes her
[33:54] trillions of dollars. They can't even
[33:57] pay back the interest. So will she put
[34:00] the screws on Trump if he gets elected
[34:04] and he will give in then to her and
[34:08] afterwards speak as the dragon. He says
[34:11] or the Catholic Church to women. Then he
[34:15] concludes the
[34:18] quote by saying thus saith the Lord.
[34:25] So it must come to pass that was
[34:30] prophesied. Now let's see if it's Trump
[34:34] uh sworn in as president 20 January
[34:39] 2025 he was sworn in and the minute he
[34:43] came in look what he does. He goes
[34:47] straight to trade war.
[34:52] World economy is
[34:55] buckled.
[34:57] Money watch the
[35:01] UN this year can't move without
[35:05] him. If he boycott it and says I don't
[35:08] want to even mention Israel and all that
[35:12] I stand with Israel. The whole world is
[35:15] against Israel. He says that everybody
[35:19] buckles. What power is that? Is that
[35:22] what we read in Revelations 13:2? Is
[35:25] that Revelations 13? Come on, man. Amen.
[35:30] We are not asleep in El Tabernacle
[35:32] because God placed a gift
[35:35] here. The G20 that they had last
[35:39] year meeting could not come to a
[35:43] deal without her. They couldn't make any
[35:48] decisions. every time they come to
[35:50] something that says we'll have to wait
[35:51] until Trump take office and see what
[35:53] he's going to do. What power is that?
[35:57] Why must the whole world stand
[36:00] still because of Trump? Revelations
[36:07] 13. Is that the scripture that I read?
[36:11] Revelations 13:2. It sure is. He has the
[36:15] power.
[36:18] Then the climate change guys also
[36:23] had a
[36:26] meeting
[36:27] and they also couldn't go forward
[36:31] because they said we got to wait until
[36:34] we see what Trump
[36:37] says. Then everybody run to Revelations
[36:41] 13.
[36:42] Trump
[36:44] everybody. What
[36:47] power has this man
[36:50] got? Revelation 13. Now when I speak
[36:54] about Trump, please put Revelations 13
[36:57] there.
[37:00] Okay, look
[37:02] at Macron of
[37:06] France running to
[37:09] him with the econ economic
[37:14] problems, the tariffs that's been put
[37:19] up. Um, look at Mark
[37:23] Kaney of
[37:26] Canada that ran
[37:29] to America to see him about the economy,
[37:36] money. Look at
[37:38] Star, the
[37:42] England prime minister ran to him. Look
[37:47] at Putin listening to
[37:51] him. Says, "I will listen to him."
[37:57] Look at him now. Few days
[38:01] ago stopped the war between India and
[38:07] Pakistan
[38:10] power. India ran to him. Syria ran to
[38:13] him. Iran ran to him. Now China
[38:18] yesterday had
[38:21] talks with him.
[38:27] You cannot
[38:31] deny such
[38:33] power and you cannot say
[38:38] that
[38:40] he Revelations
[38:42] 13 hasn't already shown his
[38:45] muscle. It's
[38:47] fulfilled. Revelations
[38:50] 13. Why? Because the Jerusalem, the New
[38:54] Jerusalem Post has said so and it's now
[38:59] on a f on a on a on a on a on a front
[39:02] pages to declare
[39:05] it. He buckled the economy around the
[39:08] world by what?
[39:11] Terrors
[39:13] 25%
[39:15] tariffs must go
[39:18] up already taken
[39:22] place.
[39:25] Gold
[39:27] soured to
[39:30] 30%
[39:34] more this year.
[39:38] I would like to bring
[39:41] in the prophecy of brother
[39:44] Brandham in statue of a perfect
[39:47] man page 56 57 and
[39:51] 58 what is it now if this nation goes
[39:55] busted Revelations 13 go busted the only
[39:59] thing it can do is go busted the only
[40:02] thing that it can do is go busted that's
[40:06] the only sensible thing to do change the
[40:08] currency but they won't do it under this
[40:12] present ministration the Roman Catholic
[40:15] Church owns the gold of the world and
[40:19] what they'll do is sell
[40:22] out then it says it's the gold standard
[40:26] they gone to the gold standard and the
[40:29] Catholic church the hierarchy owns the
[40:31] gold of the
[40:33] world someone says6 68
[40:39] billion. 168 billion. There you are.
[40:43] Throw it right back
[40:45] in the gold standard. Now, this is way
[40:49] back in '
[40:50] 62. Now, you're going to put it about
[40:54] 70* 70 with that price. Then you see how
[40:59] many trillions you got that she
[41:02] has. The gold has gone up.
[41:07] to
[41:09] exceptional
[41:11] heights. And that
[41:15] shows that the prophecy prophesied by Ed
[41:19] Gahil Rossko December was spot
[41:23] on because this year the gold price has
[41:27] gone wild.
[41:29] Now, every time you near a statue of a
[41:32] perfect man, money
[41:34] fails. When Joseph came, statue of a
[41:37] perfect man, the Bible says, "And money
[41:39] fails in the land." When Jesus came,
[41:43] money issues, the rich young ruler
[41:46] Judas, money was the issue. Econ
[41:49] economics, taxes was the
[41:53] problem. Here we are. Are we at the
[41:56] end where we have another stature of a
[42:00] perfect man chiseled out by the dynamics
[42:03] of God? The baptism in the Holy Spirit
[42:07] which makes a perfect man. He says, "And
[42:10] the spirit takes them up into faith,
[42:13] virtue, knowledge, template, a perfect
[42:15] man." Oh, what a revelation. My God, I
[42:19] feel like preaching, man. Hey, man. They
[42:22] speak about virtues. They don't even
[42:23] know what they're talking about. Amen.
[42:25] When that comes in, you'll have another
[42:28] Joseph, a perfect man.
[42:31] So
[42:33] again, something happened. The gold
[42:36] price went up. Something happened.
[42:39] There's another perfect man on the way.
[42:41] Something
[42:42] happened. Which man in the world in this
[42:45] message can sit in front of me and said
[42:48] it never happened? It already happened.
[42:52] saw
[42:54] something
[42:55] cracked. Now, Revelation 13, Trump's
[42:59] politics against the other power. He's
[43:03] flicking his muscle. Leaders run to
[43:06] Revelations 13. Sinski,
[43:10] Netanyaw, Israel, they all running
[43:13] towards him. Revelations
[43:16] 13. What a thing we have. And here we
[43:21] have a
[43:22] clip of Trump and
[43:26] Sinski right in
[43:28] Rome. Right in
[43:31] Rome. What more can be
[43:35] more
[43:37] important than Revelation 13 has his
[43:41] finger in everything. Yes. Revelation 13
[43:45] sitting in Revelation 17
[43:48] seat man that's why I'd rather walk
[43:55] alone which with which minister can I
[43:57] walk and talk you know I saw how many
[44:01] times I can't afterwards I couldn't even
[44:03] talk to him because he didn't know he's
[44:06] not a pastor so God can't talk to him
[44:08] God speaks to the pastors first now if
[44:11] the pastors can't even understand me.
[44:14] Where can ordinary members like uh
[44:17] Solarenica uh uh uh understand me? They
[44:21] can never understand me. So here you
[44:24] are on the front pages of the New
[44:28] Jerusalem Post, Revelation 13 and
[44:31] Revelation 17, sitting right there.
[44:38] So
[44:40] something has happened in the 6 months.
[44:43] It's happening within the 6 months.
[44:46] Revelation 13. Trump tried to stop the
[44:50] Ukrainian war, tried to stop Israel and
[44:53] Hamas, tried to stop the Houthies, which
[44:56] he got it right. He stopped that war
[45:00] with the Houthis. Then he stopped the
[45:02] war on India. Now, what power is that?
[45:06] My brethren, if you really are
[45:10] spiritual, you are going to run for your
[45:14] life. We're going to run for your life.
[45:18] Okay, let's go
[45:21] on. Now, the mark of the
[45:23] beast comes out of Revelations
[45:29] 13:8. And let us read it.
[45:32] that no man might buy or sell. There you
[45:37] are. What is Trump doing? You can't buy
[45:41] without me and you can't sell without
[45:43] me. Now they're running because it's a
[45:46] buying and selling. Has this thing, this
[45:50] scripture being fulfilled or is it
[45:54] fulfilled? Right up till now, China is
[45:56] actually running because they want to
[45:59] buy and sell. But who's got the
[46:03] authority, the power in buying or
[46:07] selling? He says
[46:10] 25%. Even if he drops it to 10%. They
[46:14] still going to have to pay. He's still
[46:17] going to
[46:18] everybody. So this scripture is
[46:21] fulfilled. You cannot buy or sell the
[46:25] mark of the beast.
[46:28] and that no man might buy or sell save
[46:31] he that had the
[46:33] mark or the name of the beast or the
[46:36] number of unless you come through us the
[46:40] beast of Revelation 13 that's going to
[46:43] give the power over to the real beast
[46:46] you
[46:47] know unless you have his
[46:49] number you can't
[46:52] trade I Trump which is Revelation
[46:56] 13 is going enforce this and this is
[46:58] already enforced in front of us all.
[47:00] Everybody speaks about it but they
[47:02] forgot about the
[47:04] scripture. Here is wisdom. Let him that
[47:08] hath
[47:08] understanding count the number of the
[47:11] beasts. For it is the number of a man
[47:15] and his number is 63 score and six
[47:21] 666. And you don't find it in Revelation
[47:24] 17 which is the beast of the bottomless
[47:28] but Rome. You find it in America.
[47:31] Revelation 13 under Trump.
[47:38] I'm telling you, when I saw these
[47:40] things, I was shaking. The Holy Ghost
[47:42] woke me up 4:00. I mean, uh, the 4th of
[47:48] May, and told me, "Go check these things
[47:51] out. Go back to the funeral and check
[47:53] the funeral out." And here we
[47:57] are. When I went through, I saw these
[48:00] things. I was shaking and still shaking.
[48:07] So, the mark of the beast right out of
[48:12] America. Well, now now we can understand
[48:14] it. You know, when I said it, nobody
[48:17] understood it, but now you can
[48:19] understand it. Why? It's
[48:23] because we're going to get to it, but
[48:25] I'm jumping the gun. The new pop pope
[48:28] comes out out of Revelation 13. There
[48:30] you are. There's the scripture. Where
[48:32] did brother Brandham get it? It's right
[48:34] in the
[48:35] Bible. The number of the
[48:38] beast of the antichrist of the pope is
[48:42] right in revelations 13. Where is
[48:46] this pope that we elected right
[48:50] now come from? Revelations
[48:54] 13. There's where brother William got
[48:56] it. And it's
[48:59] fulfilled. It's fulfilled.
[49:02] But somebody had to prophesy again. Who
[49:05] actually prophesied again? I'm the only
[49:07] one now that makes sense to this thing.
[49:10] You anti- messages
[49:13] um uh ministers, man, you know nothing
[49:16] about
[49:17] this. But El
[49:19] tabernacle, my prophecy December, we
[49:23] will walk in the light. God has to honor
[49:26] that. If he honored what I said, then
[49:29] he's got to honor this as well. So, we
[49:31] are in the light. So, El Dean, stay in
[49:35] the light. Don't let any other m Mickey
[49:38] Mouse minister try to wrap you up. This
[49:41] alone, just take this alone. You were
[49:44] sitting right in the church when I
[49:46] prophesied this. This alone
[49:49] should strengthen you so much that you
[49:51] close your ears to any other
[49:53] minister. Okay, let's go further.
[49:58] That number comes on Revelations 13.
[50:01] Who's handling the buying and the
[50:03] selling right
[50:05] now? A 2 year old can see
[50:10] this. A great thing has happened El
[50:13] tabernacle in your
[50:15] midst. Revelation 13 is on the march.
[50:20] Hardly six months. I told you
[50:25] there two
[50:27] women and I told you that Trump might
[50:31] represent the second woman and here we
[50:34] are.
[50:36] Okay. Revelation 13 lies the great
[50:42] earthquake. Everything Revelations
[50:45] 13 is a great earthquake. And the great
[50:49] earthquake contains can read the
[50:52] scripture when Jesus rose from the
[50:54] dead there was a
[50:56] earthquake and it was a
[50:59] resurrection. Now revelation
[51:02] 13
[51:04] is
[51:06] holding the earthquake and
[51:10] Yellowstone's
[51:11] explosion and the a bomb from Russia.
[51:17] soul come into play right now.
[51:21] America, her doom is around the
[51:25] corner. I'm so glad I'm not an
[51:29] American. I come from God and I'm going
[51:31] back to God again. God hates
[51:35] her. She's going to
[51:37] pay for all the things she's
[51:42] done.
[51:45] Um, is is this the time and the season
[51:49] for Revelations
[51:51] 13? Yes, it happened before our
[51:56] eyes. Now, as if that's too much for our
[52:01] minds to
[52:02] absorb, this thing comes like a bullet
[52:05] through our spiritual brains.
[52:09] It hit me on Monday morning the 4th May
[52:13] as I said the Pope's death first of all
[52:18] just if the Pope had to
[52:23] die that alone is a major
[52:27] thing a major thing
[52:31] happened the Pope
[52:34] died without Trump now I'm on the second
[52:38] point of what cracked. That's why I said
[52:42] who can
[52:44] argue? Who can argue against
[52:47] fruit? Now this church, this ministry
[52:51] here in EL tabernacle is not an ordinary
[52:53] ministry. Like brother B says it's all
[52:56] together ministry. Brother Bram says,
[52:58] prophecy, dynamics, mechanics, former
[53:02] rain, letter rain, prophesying, all that
[53:06] is included. Raising the dead by the
[53:10] spirit, God's grace. Amen. The healing
[53:13] that went on, all these things, it's
[53:16] right in one
[53:17] ministry. You don't find this in any
[53:19] other ministry. So, what is this? Is
[53:23] that what God made brother Brandham come
[53:25] to South Africa and lay hands on the
[53:28] head? Whether you like it or not, it's
[53:31] proven. It's fulfilled. It's finished.
[53:34] So, Revelations 13 lies the great
[53:37] earthquake and everything that needs to
[53:39] happen. That's on the front pages now.
[53:42] The season is here. So, anytime anything
[53:46] can
[53:48] happen.
[53:52] Um but it boggles our imag imag imag
[53:55] imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag
[53:55] imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag
[53:55] imag imagination that here the pope dies
[53:57] just the dying of the
[53:59] pope it it it was so ironic I look at
[54:05] jet vans revelation
[54:09] 13 I look at
[54:11] that the day
[54:13] before the pope
[54:16] died vans went to team. Jack Vans, vice
[54:22] president of Revelation
[54:25] 13. Seeing Revelation 17, there's the
[54:29] two scriptures together. Still tell me
[54:32] that this is not the New Jerusalem's
[54:36] post front page. There's it. What
[54:41] does does this guy want
[54:44] there? Go see the Pope. And look how
[54:47] nice the pope
[54:51] look. Something cracked, my friends.
[54:54] Something
[54:56] happened. Happened
[54:59] already. Still going. It happened
[55:02] already. The two scriptures is running
[55:05] together. You never thought to bring the
[55:07] two scriptures together, but the Holy
[55:09] Ghost showed me is that two scripture,
[55:12] Revelation 13, Revelation 17, Trump and
[55:15] the Pope. There you have
[55:18] it. What more do you
[55:21] want, El Tabernacle? What more do you
[55:24] want? You're not going to get anything
[55:26] better than this. I
[55:29] am going to be 80 years old and a sherk
[55:32] no more. I say the thing because it's
[55:35] the truth. I can prove it black and
[55:38] white that this is something else.
[55:45] Psalm there you
[55:48] have this day the
[55:51] scriptures is
[55:55] fulfilled. Okay, with
[55:58] this we want to bring in another clip
[56:02] of
[56:03] Trump when they ask him what do you like
[56:06] to be the
[56:07] pope and
[56:08] just look at this.
[56:12] Oh my, it is mindboggling.
[56:16] As the Vatican prepares to host the
[56:18] conclave to elect a new pontiff, Donald
[56:20] Trump has posted an AI generated image
[56:23] of himself as the pope on his social
[56:25] media platform, which the White House
[56:27] then shared on its official exac
[56:29] account. Catholics around the world say
[56:32] it's deeply insulting and makes a
[56:34] mockery of their faith. in white paper
[56:37] robes seated in an ornate chair. Donald
[56:40] Trump posted this fake image AI
[56:43] generated. It was then shared on the
[56:45] official White House account. Earlier
[56:48] this week, the US president joked he'd
[56:50] like to be the next pope. I'd like to be
[56:53] Pope. That would be my number one
[56:55] choice. Now look at that, my friends.
[56:59] This looks like a
[57:01] joke. But
[57:03] yet many a true word was said in a
[57:07] joke. Here Revelation 13 is acting like
[57:11] Revelation 17. Come on. Come on. There
[57:15] you are. Come on. Two things I'm showing
[57:19] you
[57:19] here that already happen in front of our
[57:22] eyes and nobody's saying anything.
[57:25] Ministers, ministers, man, this makes
[57:28] you so jealous because you don't get
[57:31] anything that could prove to be near
[57:35] what we getting here in El
[57:37] Tabernacle. Whether you like it or not,
[57:39] I'm saying it
[57:41] because I'm in the the the springtime,
[57:45] not my springtime, the latter time of my
[57:48] years, and I have to say who I am. Paul
[57:51] says, "Man, I magnify my
[57:54] office." So I magnify my office by
[57:58] proving you
[58:01] things. Let us look at that Revelation
[58:04] 13. In Revelation 17
[58:08] again just and and and this this
[58:12] happened really it happened after this.
[58:15] This is before choosing the pope. As the
[58:17] Vatican prepares to host the conclave to
[58:20] elect a new pontiff, Donald Trump has
[58:22] posted an AI generated image of himself
[58:24] as the pope on his social media
[58:27] platform, which the White House then
[58:29] shared on its official ex account.
[58:31] Catholics around the world say it's
[58:33] deeply insulting and makes a mockery of
[58:36] their faith. In white papal robe, seated
[58:40] in an ornate chair, Donald Trump posted
[58:42] this fake image AI generated. It was
[58:46] then shared on the official White House
[58:48] account. Earlier this week, the US
[58:50] president joked he'd like to be the next
[58:52] pope. I'd like to be pope. That would be
[58:56] my number one choice. That's his number
[58:58] one choice. Revelation 13 tell you his
[59:02] number one choice is Revelation 17. Now,
[59:05] you never heard the lingo like this. You
[59:08] never heard like this, brother. Sorry.
[59:10] They never heard this. You never heard
[59:12] it. Nobody ever heard it. This was a
[59:15] joke. And yet it came to pass before it
[59:17] happened. He already showed you that
[59:19] America is going to
[59:22] receive a
[59:25] pope. And it will be a Trump and a pope
[59:29] both out of
[59:32] America. Man, I tell you, I couldn't
[59:35] sleep when I saw it. I don't know what
[59:37] you guys are going to do. That's your
[59:39] business. But my business is the Holy
[59:43] Ghost shows me the things. I cannot shun
[59:47] to declare the councils of
[59:52] God. That joke came to pass as being the
[59:57] truth.
[59:59] Now this all
[1:00:01] happened in the six
[1:00:05] months. Revelation
[1:00:07] 17. Now, Revelation
[1:00:10] 17 has that Jubilee
[1:00:14] year. This
[1:00:15] year, in the six months, this pope
[1:00:19] opened the Jubilee
[1:00:21] doors. This is the Jubilee year. So, the
[1:00:23] past year or so, the city of Rome has
[1:00:26] been cleaning all its monuments, all its
[1:00:28] fountains, getting ready for the Jubilee
[1:00:30] year. This year, 2025 rather, the year
[1:00:33] that's coming is uh called a Jubilee
[1:00:36] year for the Catholic Church. every 25
[1:00:38] years that happens. And so, of course,
[1:00:40] they're expecting a huge influx of
[1:00:42] people into Rome, uh, to specifically to
[1:00:46] go to St. Peter's and to walk through
[1:00:48] the Holy Door, which is open once every
[1:00:50] 25 years. So, everything is nice and
[1:00:52] and spam, but of course, there
[1:00:53] going to be a lot of crowds this year
[1:00:55] coming up. So, here we are, Pantheon.
[1:00:58] Nice to be back in Rome. The weather's
[1:01:00] not great, but uh, at least it's not
[1:01:02] raining. Now, behind me is the holy door
[1:01:06] of St. Peter's
[1:01:11] Basilica. It's quite exciting to be here
[1:01:13] because normally this is cemented shut,
[1:01:16] but it's been prepared for Pope Francis
[1:01:19] to open it to begin the Jubilee year.
[1:01:22] Now, this event only takes place every
[1:01:24] 25 years. The opening of the door
[1:01:27] symbolizes God's mercy. And pilgrims who
[1:01:30] walk through the door and carry out
[1:01:32] certain acts of spirituality and charity
[1:01:35] receive forgiveness for their sins known
[1:01:37] as an indulgence.
[1:01:39] There you
[1:01:41] are right in the jubilee.
[1:01:44] Here we have a new pope.
[1:01:52] Last
[1:01:53] year was God's jubilee
[1:01:58] year. This year is the devil's jub
[1:02:01] jubilee
[1:02:03] year. Last year you got voted
[1:02:08] in a new president in Revelation 13.
[1:02:13] This year you have the Jubilee year,
[1:02:17] Satan's Jubilee year, and you have a
[1:02:20] pope voted
[1:02:22] in. Come on, how could it
[1:02:26] be? Last year, you could go free if you
[1:02:29] wanted. This year, the Roman Catholic
[1:02:32] Church says, "Your sins are
[1:02:35] forgiven." Where are we standing?
[1:02:39] How are we ever going to
[1:02:42] escape if you didn't sit like brother
[1:02:45] Brandham says study and show this these
[1:02:48] things and you sit in a church where God
[1:02:51] left long ago. God left long ago but you
[1:02:54] still sit there. There's no signs.
[1:02:57] There's no wonders. There's no
[1:02:59] preaching. There's no Holy Ghost.
[1:03:00] There's no
[1:03:02] anointing. There is no signs. There's no
[1:03:05] wonders. There's no
[1:03:07] prophesying. Get to a church where
[1:03:11] brother Brham says thrive under the
[1:03:15] supernatural.
[1:03:20] Okay.
[1:03:21] Yeah.
[1:03:24] For
[1:03:26] now, the reason of the visit is
[1:03:29] not published. We don't know why Vans
[1:03:34] actually
[1:03:35] visited. Maybe somebody knows, but I
[1:03:38] don't
[1:03:40] know. But I just know that it's in the 6
[1:03:44] months that I
[1:03:45] prophesied.
[1:03:48] Watchmen. Watchmen.
[1:03:51] Watchmen. What about the night? What
[1:03:55] about the night?
[1:03:57] Watchmen. Huh? What about the night?
[1:04:00] What do you mean the night? How many
[1:04:03] days did they wait for the election of
[1:04:09] the pope? How many
[1:04:12] days? Nine
[1:04:14] days. What happened with the ninth
[1:04:17] plague?
[1:04:19] Darkness. What happened with the pope
[1:04:22] going to
[1:04:25] Israel? Darkness. Total darkness.
[1:04:29] That's where your nine days come for.
[1:04:32] What is nine
[1:04:34] days? Nine days is to bring forth a
[1:04:36] woman bring forth after 9
[1:04:39] days. So after nine days, what did they
[1:04:42] bring
[1:04:43] forth a prison a
[1:04:46] pope right out of
[1:04:50] America? Are we
[1:04:53] sleeping? One thing our tabernacle, we
[1:04:56] are walking in the light. El Tabernacle
[1:04:58] and wherever you are and you listen to
[1:05:00] me here right now, you ought to shout
[1:05:04] your house roofs off because you were in
[1:05:07] a meeting when this happened before it
[1:05:10] happened. Can a man do and say things
[1:05:15] that will happen and it happened every
[1:05:18] time. It happens every
[1:05:21] time. No, there has never been a thing
[1:05:24] like this in this message.
[1:05:30] Six months. Watchmen.
[1:05:32] Watchmen. What about the
[1:05:36] night?
[1:05:38] Now
[1:05:41] I want to go to the day after the
[1:05:47] visit of Vans. The pope
[1:05:53] died. Was it time to hand
[1:05:58] over to the new pope that's
[1:06:02] coming?
[1:06:04] Now don't miss
[1:06:07] this. You have Revelation 13
[1:06:11] America and now you have a pope out of
[1:06:14] America. Both now comes out of America.
[1:06:20] Is William Brham a prophet?
[1:06:25] You're not going to tell me he
[1:06:27] isn't. My eyes is watching the
[1:06:31] word and I'm
[1:06:34] watching the New Jerusalem Post front
[1:06:37] page Revelations 13 and Revelation 17 is
[1:06:41] being fulfilled to the tea.
[1:06:49] So, Revelation 13 and Revelation
[1:06:52] 17 right
[1:06:54] now is getting ready to dance
[1:06:59] together because both comes out of
[1:07:01] America. They're going to dance
[1:07:05] together. That's why I
[1:07:09] read Revelation 13:3.
[1:07:13] All the world wonders
[1:07:17] after Revelation 17. Even Revelation 13
[1:07:23] went to go
[1:07:24] wonder after Revelation
[1:07:28] 17.
[1:07:32] 200,000
[1:07:34] people look how they
[1:07:38] wonder after the
[1:07:41] beast. There has never been a number
[1:07:44] like
[1:07:45] that. Now, how couldn't this
[1:07:47] behave? Look at
[1:07:51] that. Look at
[1:07:55] [Music]
[1:07:57] that. Look at that.
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:16] And you
[1:08:19] [Music]
[1:08:39] are Even the
[1:08:42] Muslims was
[1:08:45] wondering after the
[1:08:47] [Music]
[1:09:04] pope. There's Revelation 13.
[1:09:08] Right. In Revelation
[1:09:14] 17,
[1:09:16] 130
[1:09:19] states 130.
[1:09:29] Sinski.
[1:09:34] [Music]
[1:09:40] Whatever
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:58] color
[1:10:03] William It's not.
[1:10:23] So
[1:10:25] in so came this day the scripture is
[1:10:29] fulfilled. So in
[1:10:34] out tabernacle.
[1:10:37] God loves
[1:10:43] you as a UN and everybody
[1:10:48] there everybody
[1:10:50] there.
[1:10:53] So it's so
[1:10:57] ironic 130 has a 13 in it.
[1:11:05] Can you
[1:11:06] imagine? And then there
[1:11:08] was
[1:11:12] 133 cardinals that voted him in. There's
[1:11:15] another 13 in
[1:11:19] it.
[1:11:21] Then his
[1:11:23] name, the new pope's name,
[1:11:33] Robert
[1:11:35] Prios. 13
[1:11:38] letters in his
[1:11:43] name.
[1:11:44] Everything. 13
[1:11:47] 1313. Are you sleeping at Garasco?
[1:11:52] No, I'm wide awake. The next pope will
[1:11:56] come out of America and his numbers will
[1:11:59] be 13. Did brother Brennham
[1:12:01] says his surname is seven. So count the
[1:12:06] numbers in his
[1:12:09] name
[1:12:11] 13 found in Revelations
[1:12:16] 13. Now please if this is not God then
[1:12:22] tell me who is
[1:12:24] this? I don't say anything. I just get
[1:12:29] led by the
[1:12:31] spirit. And if you're spiritual, you'll
[1:12:34] know who I
[1:12:37] am. 13
[1:12:40] 13. The whole thing is just
[1:12:45] 13s. So I can't but
[1:12:48] help to see these things playing out in
[1:12:53] front of me.
[1:12:57] and he became
[1:12:59] Leo the
[1:13:02] 14th out of
[1:13:04] America under the Augustinian
[1:13:09] order. And you look
[1:13:12] at normally they
[1:13:16] have six ball bearers that carries a
[1:13:20] coffin. He had a
[1:13:23] 77 which is 14 which is right back to
[1:13:28] the Augustinian
[1:13:30] religion back
[1:13:32] to the
[1:13:34] original. And they said the minute he
[1:13:37] walks out there and you look at his
[1:13:41] regalia, his dress code, it'll tell you
[1:13:44] who he is. And when he walked out, he
[1:13:46] came with the ancient Roman regalia,
[1:13:50] showing you we're back there again to
[1:13:54] kill and to
[1:13:56] murder. The same regalia of ancient
[1:14:00] Rome. He wore the traditional red cape
[1:14:03] and trapped the traditional one that all
[1:14:06] the popes all those bad guys use.
[1:14:09] Trappings of the papacy suggesting a
[1:14:12] return to some degree of tradition after
[1:14:15] Franc's
[1:14:17] unorthodox pontific pontificate.
[1:14:22] So we back
[1:14:25] there with the
[1:14:28] old Roman Catholic order. Beyond that he
[1:14:32] has a possible first foreign trip at the
[1:14:35] end of May. Travel to Turkey to
[1:14:39] commemorate the
[1:14:41] 1,700th anniversary of the first council
[1:14:44] of Nia.
[1:14:46] Now that is
[1:14:50] what the pope before him wanted to do.
[1:14:54] That was his next trip to Nisha Rome.
[1:14:58] What do they want at N? What happened in
[1:15:00] Na Rome? Go and read what brother Bram
[1:15:03] says. What happened at Nia Rome?
[1:15:06] Everything is back
[1:15:08] there. All the bad things that happened
[1:15:10] there. a landmark event in Christian
[1:15:13] history and an important moment in
[1:15:16] Catholic Orthodox
[1:15:19] relations. So we are there
[1:15:24] again. So this guy we just have to wait
[1:15:29] for the right time when the devil
[1:15:31] stepped into him. Why? Because the Bible
[1:15:35] says, "And it became
[1:15:38] night, nine
[1:15:40] days, and the devil stepped
[1:15:44] into Judas's
[1:15:46] scariot." The devil need to step into
[1:15:49] him. He needs to get the baptism of the
[1:15:52] devil because the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:54] Ghost is cut off. Now you understand why
[1:15:58] it says there is no Holy Ghost like in
[1:16:00] El Tabernacle.
[1:16:02] Nowhere. We are right at the point where
[1:16:06] anything can happen can
[1:16:09] happen.
[1:16:11] So that
[1:16:15] is what is going on. Then I'd like to
[1:16:20] say
[1:16:23] um he's a first American pope. We know
[1:16:27] that. And
[1:16:30] um he has a
[1:16:33] degree in
[1:16:36] economics. Top brass economical guy
[1:16:40] economics buy and sell him and Donald
[1:16:44] Trump.
[1:16:46] Imagine imagine it. It's right there.
[1:16:49] The scripture first put it. Brother
[1:16:51] Brennan says it in stature of a perfect
[1:16:55] man. We read it to you. And here it is
[1:16:58] playing out
[1:17:01] people. The economics of the world says
[1:17:05] and they won't be able to buy or
[1:17:08] sell. Why? Because revelation 6 says a
[1:17:13] measure of wheat for a penny, two
[1:17:15] measures of barley for a penny, weighing
[1:17:20] up the food of the world. I don't even
[1:17:24] want to speak about
[1:17:27] taxes. I don't even want to speak about
[1:17:29] I don't even want to go in there.
[1:17:31] Tariffs is taxes and the minute there's
[1:17:34] taxes, it's the birth of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:37] So will the return of Jesus Christ also
[1:17:41] determine taxes. We have it
[1:17:45] already. Tariffs is taxes. They're
[1:17:48] taxing you. They say they're taxing the
[1:17:50] outside world, but that taxes falls on
[1:17:52] you.
[1:17:54] So both of them, the Pope and Donald
[1:17:56] Trump, Revelation 17 and Revelation 13
[1:18:00] is to do with
[1:18:03] economics,
[1:18:08] money. Oh
[1:18:09] my, I
[1:18:12] wonder El
[1:18:14] Tabernacle that you're going to get to
[1:18:16] the place now. I hope that you won't
[1:18:19] wait for these doors to open because a
[1:18:23] man stepped forward and said something
[1:18:26] is going to crack. And it did crack,
[1:18:29] it's supposed to shake ourselves to
[1:18:33] bits. I would like to put that scripture
[1:18:37] down. Uh when a man prophesy and it
[1:18:41] comes to pass, be scared of him. be
[1:18:46] scared of him. Now, I prophesied. I
[1:18:50] don't say you must be scared like uh I'm
[1:18:54] going to kill you or something, but
[1:18:55] scared that God is with me and I believe
[1:18:59] this is God, not
[1:19:01] me. Amen.
[1:19:05] So then then then watch this thing. Then
[1:19:09] watch this thing. They gave it nine
[1:19:14] days and then they started. When did
[1:19:17] they
[1:19:19] start with the election of the pope?
[1:19:23] Wednesday. What was
[1:19:25] Wednesday? The 7th of
[1:19:29] May. What happened the 7th of May
[1:19:35] 1946? The angel of the Lord came to
[1:19:37] brother Brandham. We'll give two quotes.
[1:19:40] I don't have it here. I forgot it. But
[1:19:42] we'll put it
[1:19:45] in. The angel of the Lord came to
[1:19:48] brother Brandham the 7th of May. Now,
[1:19:50] how could they have the election of the
[1:19:52] Pope the 7th of
[1:19:55] May and say Israel will be a
[1:20:00] nation? And the 7th of May they had the
[1:20:03] first election. Was
[1:20:05] that that the Catholic
[1:20:11] Church? Their wound will be completely
[1:20:17] healed. Is
[1:20:20] it? It's up to you to make up your
[1:20:23] mind. But for
[1:20:26] me, a new thing
[1:20:29] happened after the 7th of May. And after
[1:20:34] the 7th of May, now a new thing
[1:20:37] happened. A pope came out of
[1:20:42] America. It cannot be so perfect. It
[1:20:46] cannot be Amen. So
[1:20:49] prophetic that everything is just lined
[1:20:52] up. The Jubilees, everything is just
[1:20:55] lining up. The name is lining up.
[1:20:58] Everything is lining. The economy is
[1:21:00] lining up. Trump is lining up. He played
[1:21:05] Revelation 17 and he's Revelation 13.
[1:21:09] So my
[1:21:14] brethren,
[1:21:16] something did
[1:21:21] crack. 200,000 people at the funeral.
[1:21:31] 133
[1:21:33] cardinals chose
[1:21:36] him and
[1:21:39] 130 heads of state
[1:21:42] there. All the nations represented all
[1:21:46] religions
[1:21:47] represented all news platforms was
[1:21:53] buzzing on this event. Even the Muslim
[1:21:57] network
[1:21:59] Alazer couldn't keep quiet but had a
[1:22:03] special representative there in Rome
[1:22:08] because they all wondering after the
[1:22:14] beast. This makes it a major major major
[1:22:19] thing that happened.
[1:22:23] So as I closed
[1:22:26] down, something did
[1:22:30] crack and something did
[1:22:34] happen. And the Bible says they wonder
[1:22:37] after him, small and
[1:22:41] great, rich and poor, the Bible says
[1:22:45] free and
[1:22:47] bond, wonders after him.
[1:22:50] This happened before our eyes. All of
[1:22:53] them was there. Like the Bible says, the
[1:22:57] pope should only be the pastor of the
[1:23:00] Roman Catholic
[1:23:03] Church or a imam or a rabbi. That's all
[1:23:08] that he is. Why does all the heads of
[1:23:11] state go there? If this is a church with
[1:23:15] a local shepherd, a local imam, a local
[1:23:21] rabbi, that
[1:23:23] means this should be the
[1:23:29] antichrist. No two ways about
[1:23:33] it. So everything to do with the end
[1:23:37] time is embedded in here.
[1:23:40] Everything about the a bomb, everything
[1:23:43] is revelation 13, Revelation 17. Both of
[1:23:47] them gets the a
[1:23:48] bomb and both of them is in play now.
[1:23:52] It's in season
[1:23:54] now. So you look
[1:23:59] at that wound being completely healed.
[1:24:04] Not
[1:24:05] wounded. It was wounded with nicer Rome
[1:24:07] and paple Rome and we know that but now
[1:24:10] completely healed. Nobody feels that
[1:24:14] they done anything by killing 100
[1:24:16] million Christians in
[1:24:19] uh that's in the catacombs and what have
[1:24:23] you. It's completely
[1:24:26] healed the image to the beast.
[1:24:29] Revelation 13. They will hand it over
[1:24:34] to the beast very soon. And then I would
[1:24:39] like to say is just look at how many
[1:24:43] ministers just
[1:24:45] fell TD Jake. Look what happened to him.
[1:24:49] It's also worldly thing that happened.
[1:24:54] Look at um
[1:24:57] um Marcus
[1:25:01] Lamb. It's also a worldly
[1:25:06] thing. TD
[1:25:08] Joshua, look at him. What happened to
[1:25:12] him? Spiritual
[1:25:14] side. Everything cracked up. Look at
[1:25:18] what happened in Dio Gloria.
[1:25:24] And I said
[1:25:27] there that Raymond Thompson said that he
[1:25:31] gave out and bought the tapes and play
[1:25:35] bought the realtore tapes and bought the
[1:25:38] tapes and I said Raymond just tell me
[1:25:41] where you bought it from. I start the
[1:25:43] tape service bruti. I hired the hall. I
[1:25:46] paid signed the lease. I bought a real
[1:25:49] and I picked up the people and started
[1:25:51] tape services.
[1:25:54] Now I don't want to argue about who
[1:25:57] bought the
[1:25:58] reels. Raymond, all that I ask, tell me
[1:26:02] from who did you buy the reels. Please
[1:26:04] don't make a mistake
[1:26:06] here. From who did you buy the
[1:26:10] reals? Like you say, I would like to
[1:26:14] know. Now remember Raymond I know the
[1:26:18] history of
[1:26:19] aative so don't make a mistake
[1:26:22] here from who did you buy the reals
[1:26:25] that's all that I want to
[1:26:27] know and now it's after 5 months one of
[1:26:30] the days in the 6 months he still didn't
[1:26:33] answer so was that a lie brother so
[1:26:36] Renica was that a lie it sure
[1:26:40] was it sure
[1:26:42] was and I just wanted to know since when
[1:26:45] did he have a whole set of brother
[1:26:46] Brandham's cassette tapes? Not the real
[1:26:49] to real. The real to real. He's
[1:26:51] completely out. You don't even know
[1:26:53] where the real to reals was made. It was
[1:26:55] before his
[1:26:57] day. And I I I'm waiting for him to
[1:27:00] answer me. Then I'll I'll prove it to
[1:27:02] you where the real tapes come
[1:27:04] from. So uh but it's not answered which
[1:27:07] is a lie. Now, can a man come and stand
[1:27:10] in front of the whole world and make a
[1:27:12] statement that I bought the real truth.
[1:27:15] I this and I that and it was not
[1:27:18] him. He was
[1:27:20] lying and he bought the
[1:27:23] tapes. Now I can say he was lying and
[1:27:26] you guys are following him. I wonder if
[1:27:29] I had to do just one of the little
[1:27:30] things that he done, I would have been
[1:27:33] buried. All you ministers would have
[1:27:34] buried
[1:27:35] me. But these guys can sleep with women.
[1:27:38] They can lie. They can do whatever they
[1:27:40] want to and they still accept it. And
[1:27:42] here I am. You can't accept me.
[1:27:45] Why? Because we're playing in
[1:27:47] Revelations 13 and Revelation 17. He
[1:27:51] that's
[1:27:52] filthy, let him be filthy
[1:27:54] still. So church, may God bless you. El
[1:27:59] tabernacle, I wouldn't want to come
[1:28:02] here. It's just that now everybody was
[1:28:05] waiting for me in my church to say
[1:28:08] something about the
[1:28:10] pope and now I told you where it started
[1:28:14] from Revelation 13 because he wanted to
[1:28:17] tell me about Revelation 17 later on but
[1:28:21] I had Revelation 13 worked out and
[1:28:23] watched
[1:28:25] him and I just want to put Revelation 13
[1:28:29] in Revelation 17 again. Can we have that
[1:28:32] clip as I
[1:28:35] close? There you
[1:28:38] are. Imagine this was supposed to be a
[1:28:43] joke and yet it came to
[1:28:46] pass. And Revelations
[1:28:49] 13 was portraying Revelation 17. And it
[1:28:53] came to
[1:28:55] pass. God bless you, Al Tabernacle.
[1:29:00] And I want to say
[1:29:02] it. Don't move from El
[1:29:05] Tabernacle. You're in the right place.
[1:29:08] Shalom.
