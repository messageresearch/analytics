TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it must be a Marvel because seven is God's number how about 77 77 is twice seven and twice seven is twice God I am free free free Jesus made me free once I was bound by the chains of Satan but now I'm free Hallelujah there's nothing the devil can do amen hallelujah you forgiven today praise God that a man of God tell you that today a man that stands in the presence of God whatsoever I find is bounded whatsoever I lose his loose and I'm losing forgiveness here today you forgiven you're forgiven my idea amen the rock the Russians got no water in now you know yeah cannot look upon son that he says you come not nigh your wife in the time of the supernatural when you have to purify yourself you that cannot even stay away from a concubine you got your wife and you gotta concubine you are so filled with lust that you have to have another woman how are you going to make it and that's something else is Michael Heyman he comes for the soul because he's the angel of the Soul he's the angel of the theophany he comes down and nobody touched that Soul nobody can touch that Soul because the captain of the Lord's host Michael Daniel chapter 12 verse 1 stands for the soul yes he says now which rules that Fourth Man in the fire my brother sister when you in a trial amen the chatra says who is that fat man walking with that man Hallelujah brother when you're down and out I want to know who's that man that's walking with him sister I want to know which man is that that's walking with you it's the same Holy Ghost it's an angel with a swept back Wings it is called Almighty it is Michael that will stand for his people even in Edgar Oscar's church if they don't have this is deadly kill them mutton loose do away with them for the ones when losses in the message thank you Pastor Elders he tries to pass the horse then he comes down the use of the truck and then when it looks like that then Lucifer wants to block him he goes back into the inside real hey man I said Lord I'm having trouble I can't bring the answer to one of your children you said Michael with me said Michael flies out [Applause] loud [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] so glad that I let you the right pathways and I know that I'm gonna see you in the morning because I don't want you to take my skins off me when we get there I want you to carry me I say thank the Lord for a man that didn't turn punches oh how many preachers stood on the back side of the desert in the presence of the pull out fire amen and until their souls were shining with the Holy Ghost before stepping into the pulpit amen ask them they won't have the same experience that William Branham had they would not have the same experience that the Bible says they only have an experience because of the word by quotes but it come by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that sanctions you nothing else and I don't care who you are [Applause] [Music] I am the apostle why because my fruits tell me I am so when you see God you see me and when you see me you see God and Devil let me tell you when the 70th Jubilee come you're gonna see another God Amen called The Bride of Jesus Christ walking on two feet and said let that be let there be let there be let there be good [Music]
