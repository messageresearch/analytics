[0:00] Where flowers bloom, so do hope.
[0:04] Good evening, saints, and special
[0:06] greetings to all the beautiful ladies of
[0:08] our tabernacle.
[0:10] We recently celebrated our woman's day
[0:13] in Christ Jesus. The team bloom where
[0:16] you are planted was featured.
[0:18] The atmosphere was electrifying
[0:22] and uplifting.
[0:24] What a blessed
[0:26] and amazing day we had.
[0:29] to tell you all nothing was outsourced.
[0:33] Our speakers, our caterers, our
[0:36] floristers,
[0:37] our decor ladies, everything proudly L
[0:41] tabernacle
[0:44] and we have received positive feedbacks
[0:45] from the sisters who attended.
[0:49] But now we have an an important
[0:51] announcement.
[0:53] With the woman month, women's month
[0:56] closing up, the apostle has thought it
[0:58] wise and requested that the book titled
[1:03] Just for the Ladies
[1:05] by Brother Brennan be made available to
[1:08] the L Tabernacle ladies.
[1:12] We want to share a few insights and on
[1:16] how this book can be a blessing to you
[1:19] to each one of you. And we have our dear
[1:22] loving sister Abigail here with us to
[1:25] elaborate on a few questions. Thank you
[1:28] for joining us sister Abigail. You're
[1:30] welcome sister.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; Sister Abigail um what are some of the
[1:36] insights as to how this book can help
[1:39] the sisters and what is the what is it
[1:42] that the apostle would like the sister
[1:44] to take from this book?
[1:47] &gt;&gt; Good evening everybody.
[1:49] Um, I think I need to start off with to
[1:51] say where this book originated from.
[1:55] Sister Rosco had a copy of this book and
[1:58] somehow it just got missing and God
[2:02] purposed it so that sister Joanie found
[2:05] a copy of the same book in the US and
[2:08] she gave it to us a couple of years ago.
[2:11] So when the seminar came up and um I saw
[2:15] the answers that the apostle gave it
[2:18] just pointed back to the book. So the
[2:22] apostle has twigged it a bit and we
[2:25] would like every sister to have a copy
[2:28] of it. So the book is based on
[2:33] questions that our precious uh prophet
[2:37] was asked and how he answered them. But
[2:40] it's targeted mainly to the ladies, the
[2:43] sisters. And it is in line with our
[2:47] doctrine, our belief, with many um
[2:51] scriptures added to the questions and
[2:54] the answers. And then the apostle what
[2:57] he wants us to take out of the book is
[3:01] the there's a lot of questions that the
[3:04] uh prophet answers by saying uh he
[3:07] doesn't have scripture to prove what he
[3:10] is saying but you need to make sure that
[3:13] your um your objective and your motives
[3:16] are right in anything you do as a
[3:19] Christian. So that's the main focus the
[3:21] apostle wants us to take because so many
[3:24] of the questions we receive the apostle
[3:27] doesn't really have scriptures for it
[3:30] but it is a matter of staying away from
[3:32] sin then coming closer to sin. So that's
[3:35] the main objective and then I think it
[3:39] is for us to bloom where we are planted.
[3:42] Beautiful. We're looking forward to it.
[3:44] Um just another question instead. Um
[3:48] what are some of the nuggets in the book
[3:50] that the ladies can look forward to to
[3:52] reading?
[3:53] Well, not to give a lot away. I think
[3:56] the book covers a lot covers how to be a
[4:00] good wife, a good mom. It covers a lot
[4:03] on dress code. It even covers on having
[4:08] unbelieving husbands. So I think there
[4:11] is so much nuggets for each one. It
[4:14] depends what applies to your life. So it
[4:18] applies for young and old and I think I
[4:22] will keep my nuggets to myself for you
[4:25] to enjoy your nuggets out of the book.
[4:28] So does that mean because I wanted to
[4:30] ask you on a personal note, what are the
[4:33] key concepts you personally enjoyed in
[4:36] this book?
[4:37] &gt;&gt; Well, for me I enjoyed the ending and
[4:41] the beginning of the book. the ending
[4:44] because
[4:45] um it speaks about menopause and that's
[4:48] what I'm going through now Mles
[4:50] unfortunately
[4:52] and I enjoyed the testimony that Rebecca
[4:55] Brandon gave that what her mom went
[4:58] through and I'd never known about that.
[5:01] I've read a lot of uh brother Brandon
[5:04] speaking on Wright's uh sister that was
[5:07] going through menopause. So to me that
[5:10] had a bit of a personal impact and I
[5:13] didn't realize that so many sisters went
[5:16] through the prayer line where the
[5:18] prophet prayed for them and I think the
[5:20] the nice part that Rebecca says her dad
[5:23] told her that her mom will be better off
[5:26] after this. So I'm looking forward to
[5:29] that part of being better off. And then
[5:32] I think it's the beginning of the book
[5:34] where they have a nice quotation where
[5:36] the prophet speaks about his wife and
[5:39] just to see how kind and gentle and
[5:43] loving the prophet was towards his wife.
[5:46] And he even says she's getting old now.
[5:49] But I love her the way I loved her back
[5:51] then. So that was remarkable for me
[5:54] because the prophet is always seen as
[5:57] somebody that was illuminated and to see
[6:00] the soft part when it comes to the
[6:02] sisters was remarkable. It just shows me
[6:06] how the apostle feels about us that he
[6:09] has a soft part when it comes to the
[6:11] sisters and how they get treated. So I
[6:15] think it's a good read and a mustave
[6:17] because everybody will be able to get
[6:20] something out of it. Oh, amen. Thank you
[6:23] so much, Sister Abby. As you all heard,
[6:25] this is a must readad and we want to
[6:28] thank you for your input and insight
[6:30] into the groups. There we have it,
[6:32] ladies. We really do appreciate our
[6:34] apostle, the leadership, the love they
[6:36] have for us and the care. Sisters, with
[6:39] all the wisdom that has been shared and
[6:42] will be shared by reading this book,
[6:44] don't miss out. Go and grab your copy.
[6:50] I think it will be a available at the
[6:52] combine titled just for the ladies. Be
[6:56] sure to get one. Thank you so much. God
[6:59] bless you. See you in the library.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; Bye
[7:02] &gt;&gt; bye.
