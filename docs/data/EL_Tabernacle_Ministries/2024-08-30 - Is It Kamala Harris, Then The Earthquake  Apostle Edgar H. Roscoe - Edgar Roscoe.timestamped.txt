[0:01] uh good
[0:03] evening El
[0:06] tle it's
[0:08] uh as again
[0:11] we thought about making
[0:15] uh this video clip
[0:18] again uh because things as I told you
[0:21] the last time things are happening so
[0:25] fast that
[0:27] um we can't keep up
[0:31] um because you know you know our
[0:33] ministry is not a ordinary Ministry is
[0:37] is um Apostolic which brother Braham
[0:41] says it's evangelism and uh prophetic uh
[0:46] combin U make the apostolic uh Ministry
[0:52] so it's not an ordinary minist Ministry
[0:55] by taking a word and and expounding on a
[0:59] word and you know but it's uh based more
[1:03] on what brother brandham has prophesied
[1:06] on the prophetic side and
[1:09] um getting the sense of it now we we
[1:13] have anointed that quote for many years
[1:17] in birth
[1:18] pains that brother Bram says men will
[1:21] come after me and make more
[1:24] SS because brother brandham didn't have
[1:27] enough time on many topics
[1:31] that
[1:32] he he actually
[1:34] um uh preached on and
[1:38] prophesied so
[1:41] um uh I think that's the reason he he
[1:45] put that quote
[1:46] out so I I just uh want to remind you
[1:53] about what I heard believe Paul told us
[1:56] when brother B preached on the rapture
[1:59] how that woman went on brother brandham
[2:02] didn't have enough time to finish it
[2:05] because she was running at the back then
[2:08] and waving and telling brother Brandon
[2:10] we must stop and the prophet uh really
[2:14] couldn't put uh his teeth into the thing
[2:19] so
[2:20] uh he um just said enough for the five
[2:25] minut to pick it up and uh uh and Mak
[2:30] sense to it and and and a lot of you
[2:32] know statue of a perfect man all those
[2:35] quotes uh
[2:38] messages
[2:39] so we uh are yeah and U with the
[2:44] prophecy and the the seven visions of
[2:46] brother brandham to
[2:50] actually uh make more sense to it and uh
[2:55] we uh have dissected it and when we saw
[3:00] these things
[3:02] happening the Prophecies of brother
[3:05] brandham came to
[3:07] our attention and that's the reason we
[3:09] busy that's why we say that U we uh
[3:14] we're just different our ministry is
[3:17] different our preaching is different
[3:19] Paul says You Preach according to your
[3:21] faith you know so this is according to
[3:25] our faith on the prophetic level not
[3:28] that we are prophets but brother
[3:30] brandham you know brother sister we in a
[3:32] prophetic class so prophetic class needs
[3:35] a prophet uh to preach to them so
[3:39] brother Brandon preached to us and us in
[3:42] the prophetic class could understand him
[3:44] and further break it down so uh I
[3:48] thought let me just tell you
[3:50] that and uh I uh have entitled the thing
[3:56] is it
[3:57] Camila's is Camila Harris
[4:00] uh uh then the earthquake is it she
[4:05] first and then the earthquake so I got
[4:09] reason why I said so I I'll show you
[4:11] Clips just now that really shocked me so
[4:15] I thought uh let me get back to you
[4:18] because I won't be here um next week on
[4:23] Friday uh we'll be in Angola so I
[4:27] thought uh we'll make this video club
[4:30] for Friday so that you can be on par on
[4:34] what's happening in the
[4:36] world so
[4:38] listen I'm only venturing
[4:42] in I'm only
[4:45] pondering like brother Val used to like
[4:48] this word pondering let's Ponder I'm
[4:52] only
[4:53] pondering I'm only saying could it
[4:58] be or
[5:03] predicting not
[5:08] prophesying in that this thing might be
[5:13] in this
[5:14] sequence
[5:17] so I have the
[5:19] sequence that I feel it might be that
[5:23] way and you know we we all have our own
[5:28] ideas
[5:30] and we have uh our own Inspirations how
[5:33] it'll happen but God is the one that
[5:36] actually put it really in in sequence so
[5:40] uh I have the
[5:43] elections which is going on
[5:45] now and then uh after that the 70 weeks
[5:48] of Daniel and the 70th
[5:52] Jubilee uh running
[5:54] out um in
[5:57] September and uh
[6:01] you know that uh the um rabis is now
[6:07] really on this thing about September
[6:10] where the jubilees is running out and um
[6:15] and point number three is uh could it do
[6:19] money will
[6:20] fail in Statue of a perfect man after
[6:24] that and could after that be the
[6:27] earthquake
[6:30] and could after the
[6:32] earthquake be right in the seventh
[6:35] Vision
[6:38] when Elijah and Moses will be coming
[6:44] to
[6:46] 144,000 and uh could it be in that
[6:48] sequence which is actually the end of
[6:51] the world we know that the ab bomb which
[6:53] is the end of the world will that five
[6:56] things happen like there and the pope
[6:58] sits in Jerusalem and break the treaty
[7:02] now I gave you the quote nothing wrong
[7:08] with probing brother Bram tells you that
[7:10] and SS is a time there's nothing wrong
[7:13] in probing when you probe you just when
[7:16] going to see can it be so that's why he
[7:19] say says is this the time he was probing
[7:24] and uh although it was thus say the Lord
[7:28] and um
[7:30] so we we we only proing so um we have
[7:36] listened to Trump on the on the club of
[7:40] trump uh Trump saying Camila Harris is a
[7:43] beautiful human uh uh woman
[7:49] so let's listen to him Time Magazine
[7:53] think of this Time
[7:56] Magazine doesn't have a picture of her
[7:59] they have this unbelievable artist
[8:01] drawing her and I said is that Sophia
[8:06] Laura and I
[8:08] couldn't who might that be is that
[8:11] Elizabeth Taylor they say she was a
[8:13] beautiful woman who is it so beautiful
[8:16] drawing it's a drawing they took a lot
[8:19] of pictures it didn't work out so they
[8:21] hired a sketch
[8:24] artist I said I'm sure oh they must be
[8:27] celebrating the great Life and Times of
[8:29] the magnificently
[8:30] beautiful Sophia Lauren and you're not
[8:34] allowed to say this anymore you know
[8:35] David don't ever get caught in this trap
[8:37] David please don't ever
[8:40] call a woman beautiful because that'll
[8:42] be the end of your political career
[8:45] please I want to make your life much
[8:47] easier
[8:48] David by the way he's also got a great
[8:51] wife I have to say he's got a great wife
[8:53] but you
[8:57] know I mean I read a a so-called
[9:00] Republican who Ronald Reagan didn't like
[9:02] by the way and she didn't like him but
[9:04] she got credit for being this Reagan
[9:06] speech writer highly overrated I don't
[9:09] know anything about her I don't know her
[9:11] treats me badly but that's okay she
[9:14] called it wrong she's called it wrong
[9:15] now for about eight years but she said
[9:18] one thing that got me she said kamla has
[9:21] one big Advantage she's a very beautiful
[9:27] woman she's a
[9:30] [Music]
[9:32] so I decid to go back and reread the
[9:35] Clause I'm not saying he's but I say
[9:37] that I am much better looking than her I
[9:39] think I'm much better much better I'm a
[9:43] better looking person then CA well there
[9:48] you have
[9:49] it
[9:51] um the
[9:54] um the
[9:57] beauty of Kamala is now now we have the
[10:00] Roman Catholic Church beautiful and now
[10:03] they are saying that Chamilia is but
[10:06] beautiful
[10:08] so imagine being an uh opponent or R
[10:13] rival saying
[10:16] this and we have the
[10:19] prophet saying she look like uh uh she
[10:24] she's a beautiful woman she look like uh
[10:28] he says she you look like Sophia Lauren
[10:31] now if you young people ever saw Sophia
[10:35] Lauren she is also blushing blacking you
[10:40] know she was one of the the Queens in
[10:43] the 60s I think uh but brother brandham
[10:48] also speak about a beautiful
[10:50] woman I wonder if we got a
[10:53] quote then when these women help elect
[10:57] the wrong person then seen a great woman
[11:00] rise up in the United
[11:02] States well-dressed and
[11:05] beautiful but cruel and
[11:08] heart she will either guide or lead this
[11:11] nation to a
[11:13] ruination I got in princes perhaps
[11:16] Catholic
[11:17] Church there you have the
[11:20] quote uh how could brother Brandon 91
[11:23] years ago say a thing like this and here
[11:27] Trump comes and say the same thing so um
[11:31] it shows you that um it is right in line
[11:37] um with uh What uh the prophet um
[11:41] saw uh 91 years ago 19 uh
[11:46] 33 and uh we could say that that portion
[11:52] of um of the prophecy is fulfilled Trum
[11:57] fulfilled it the other day
[12:01] then the write up on the cover of
[12:06] Time
[12:11] Magazine is
[12:14] um it's a a beautiful picture of her
[12:20] there she
[12:21] is and
[12:23] um we will uh play the quote she'll be a
[12:27] pretty human now both is pretty human as
[12:30] we already played the quote so um and
[12:34] the right up in Time
[12:37] Magazine will take a f things out there
[12:41] the reintroduction of CA Harris excerpts
[12:44] from the article published by Time
[12:47] Magazine inside of Philadelphia Arena on
[12:50] August 6th vice president camela Harris
[12:53] was greeted with a kind of reception a
[12:56] Democratic presidential candidate hasn't
[12:58] G en in years fans packed into overflow
[13:02] spaces waving homemade signs made of
[13:05] glitter and glue as drum lines roared
[13:09] when Harris introduced her new running
[13:11] mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walls the
[13:14] cheering lasted more than a minute if
[13:17] you'd predicted this scene a month ago
[13:18] to anyone following the race they would
[13:21] never have believed you but Harris has
[13:24] pulled off the swiftest vibe shift in
[13:26] modern political history a contest that
[13:29] revolved around the cognitive decline of
[13:32] a geriatric president has been
[13:34] transformed Joe Biden is out Harris is
[13:37] in and a second Donald Trump presidency
[13:41] no longer seems
[13:43] inevitable Democrats resigned to a grim
[13:45] Death March toward certain defeat as one
[13:49] National organizer put it felt their
[13:51] Gloom replaced by a jolt of Hope Harris
[13:55] smashed fundraising records raking in
[13:58] 310 milli
[13:59] in July she packed stadiums and
[14:02] dominated Tik Tock offering a fresh
[14:04] message focused on the future over the
[14:07] past volunteers signed up in droves
[14:11] Trump's widening leads across the
[14:13] Battleground States
[14:15] evaporated over the span of a few weeks
[14:18] in Late July and early August Harris
[14:21] became a political phenomenon our
[14:24] campaign is not just a fight against
[14:26] Donald Trump she told the cheering crowd
[14:29] in Philadelphia our campaign is a fight
[14:33] for the future judging from the past few
[14:36] weeks Harris's own party underestimated
[14:40] her maybe the crowded 2020 primary just
[14:44] wasn't the right race for Harris to
[14:46] Showcase her talents maybe the vice
[14:49] presidency wasn't the right role
[14:52] suddenly she seems matched to the moment
[14:55] a former prosecutor running against a
[14:58] convicted felon
[14:59] a defender of abortion rights running
[15:02] against the man who helped overturn Row
[15:05] versus Wade a Next Generation Democrat
[15:08] running against a 78-year-old
[15:11] Republican perhaps above all she has
[15:14] given Americans the one thing they
[15:16] overwhelmingly told polsters they wanted
[15:19] a credible alternative to the two
[15:21] unpopular old men who have held the job
[15:24] for the past eight long years Harris may
[15:28] still be the dog Trump has arguably the
[15:31] clearer path to 270 electoral votes and
[15:35] an edge on the issues that voters say
[15:38] are most important to
[15:40] them she inherited a campaign
[15:43] infrastructure and policy record from
[15:46] her predecessor but the energy is all
[15:49] hers picking walls as a running mate
[15:52] over more conventional choices signals a
[15:55] belief that this race is as much about
[15:58] feelings as it is about fundamentals
[16:01] Harris's brand shift the happy warrior
[16:04] attitude the viral memes the iroll at
[16:07] Republican weirdos has already done what
[16:10] no Trump opponent has ever been able to
[16:13] do snatch the spotlight away from him
[16:17] she may seem like an overnight sensation
[16:20] but Harris's moment was years in the
[16:23] making quietly her small team of top
[16:26] AIDS had been laying the groundwork for
[16:29] a future presidential run after the
[16:32] Supreme Court's dobs decision the vice
[16:35] president added Reproductive Rights to
[16:37] her
[16:38] portfolio abortion was never a
[16:40] comfortable issue for Biden a devout
[16:43] Catholic but it was a natural fit for
[16:46] his number two Harris believed that with
[16:48] Rog gone Republicans would turn their
[16:51] sights to restricting both birth control
[16:54] and IVF in the months after dobs she
[16:58] traveled the us talking about abortion
[17:01] rights as a matter of reproductive
[17:04] Freedom as far back as the 2022 midterms
[17:09] Aid say she argued for making this the
[17:11] core of the party's National message
[17:14] even as the White House focused on jobs
[17:17] and the economy with Biden no longer a
[17:20] top the ticket the morban Democratic
[17:23] Grassroots came to life Harris was
[17:26] capable of delivering a message that
[17:28] never felt quite right under Clinton or
[17:31] Biden that theirs was the party of the
[17:33] future and Trump was of the past her
[17:37] campaign raised $200 million in the
[17:40] first week in what it said was the best
[17:43] 24 hours of any candidate in
[17:45] presidential campaign history more than
[17:48] 38,000 people registered on vote.org in
[17:52] the 48 hours after she became the
[17:55] presumptive nominee eclipsing the voter
[17:57] registration surge encouraged by Taylor
[18:00] Swift Last year within a week Harris
[18:03] erased Trump's polling dominance in key
[18:06] States turning a burgeoning landslide
[18:09] into a dead heat elections come down to
[18:12] Vibes and CA has got the Vibes right now
[18:16] says David hog co-founder of the genz
[18:19] political organization leaders we
[18:22] deserve after spending his entire
[18:25] political career organizing against
[18:27] Trump and his allies hog explains it
[18:31] felt good to finally have someone to
[18:33] vote for people are feeling the type of
[18:35] energy they felt during the Obama
[18:38] campaign says Michigan state senator
[18:40] Darren caleri who spends his weekends
[18:43] door knocking in his competitive
[18:45] District South of Detroit it feels
[18:48] different than with Hillary different
[18:50] than with Biden celebrities like Charlie
[18:53] XCX and Megan the stallion came out in
[18:57] support of Paris speaking in a packed
[19:01] airplane hanger in Detroit UAW president
[19:04] sha Fain called her a badass woman the
[19:09] campaign's new Harris walls camo hats
[19:11] sold out within half an hour Grassroots
[19:15] groups are seeing an explosion in
[19:17] fundraising and volunteer
[19:19] signups my niece who called Biden
[19:22] genocide Joe called me to say auntie I
[19:26] want to do something recall S leosha
[19:29] brown co-founder of black voters matter
[19:33] the shift is perhaps most visible in the
[19:35] digital sphere while millions of
[19:38] Hardcore Democrats would crawl over
[19:40] broken glass to keep Trump from
[19:43] reelection less reliable voters in gen Z
[19:46] are especially attuned to online
[19:49] trends for months President Biden's
[19:52] online supporters have been on the
[19:54] defensive about his support for Israel's
[19:57] war against Hamas comments about Gaza
[20:02] flooded Pro Biden content posted to
[20:04] social platforms making it difficult to
[20:07] create what digital strategists call a
[20:09] permission structure to support him to
[20:13] many it evoked the online mobs who would
[20:15] mock Clinton's supporters in
[20:18] 2016 preventing her from building
[20:20] traction on social media in 2016 if you
[20:25] wanted to be an online supporter of
[20:27] Hillary Clinton you did it in a private
[20:30] Facebook group says Litman in
[20:33] 2024 you blasted on Tik Tok and you're
[20:36] part of the kive and you make your
[20:38] username the coconut
[20:42] tree her early months as VP were
[20:45] checkered too big interviews went poorly
[20:49] Harris seemed ill-prepared and unsteady
[20:52] on her feet Biden reportedly vented to a
[20:55] friend that she was a work in progress
[20:59] he saddled her with a portfolio of
[21:01] difficult thankless work like addressing
[21:04] the root causes of the flow of
[21:06] undocumented immigrants from Central
[21:09] America's Northern triangle by
[21:12] 2023 Harris had the lowest approval
[21:15] ratings for a vice president in history
[21:19] it's always hard for the vice president
[21:22] because the president is the one setting
[21:24] the policy taking the responsibility
[21:27] says represent ative Adam Schiff a
[21:30] California Democrat and close Ally of
[21:33] Harris and historically vice presidents
[21:37] have often taken on the work that the
[21:39] president doesn't want to do another
[21:42] Democrat puts it more bluntly they set
[21:45] her up to fail from day one one
[21:48] challenge for Harris has been the people
[21:50] around her over the years a rotating
[21:54] cast of senior staff has clouded her
[21:56] message and raised questions about her
[21:59] abilities as a manager she needs a few
[22:02] political consiliari in her life she
[22:05] doesn't have a North star guiding her
[22:07] says one Democratic strategist she has
[22:11] made novice political moves that the
[22:13] political Elite and the pundits have
[22:16] glommed on to that have pushed the
[22:18] narrative that she's not ready for prime
[22:21] time that narrative has been out of date
[22:23] for some time according to allies who
[22:26] have worked with her and watched her
[22:28] closely Harris has mastered the art of
[22:31] arm twisting required to pass major
[22:34] legislation and become a global Diplomat
[22:37] championing Democratic goals she has
[22:40] gone Booker says from being a Padawan to
[22:44] a Jedi master yet if Harris was widely
[22:48] underestimated it's also true that her
[22:51] circumstances have radically changed
[22:54] success in politics is situational
[22:57] Harris no longer has to compete with
[22:59] more than 20 other democrats for
[23:01] attention on the campaign Trail or
[23:04] contort herself to appease liberal
[23:06] pities to win over the party's base she
[23:10] no longer has to be a loyal Deputy to
[23:12] the president who calls all the shots
[23:15] now the moment is finally hers
[23:18] Republicans admit Harris will be harder
[23:20] to beat than a diminished Biden but they
[23:23] believe the candidate Riding High the
[23:25] past few weeks will soon under sustained
[23:28] attack come down to earth if she runs
[23:32] the same kind of campaign she ran in
[23:34] 2019 and 20120 her campaign will
[23:38] collapse and Donald Trump will Waltz
[23:40] into the White House Republican pollster
[23:43] Whit a says on the other hand if she has
[23:47] learned as much as her allies and
[23:49] friends say she has in the last four
[23:52] years she will give Trump a real run for
[23:55] his money Harris is more popular with
[23:57] younger black and Latino voters than
[24:00] Biden was when he dropped out of the
[24:02] race according to polling which puts her
[24:05] in a stronger position to win the Sun
[24:07] Belt states at the same time she may be
[24:10] losing ground with older white voters
[24:13] which makes her more vulnerable in the
[24:15] trio of blue wall States Michigan
[24:18] Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that form
[24:21] that core of the Democrats Electoral
[24:24] College strategy to shore up those
[24:26] States Harris is is leaning on her major
[24:29] labor endorsements and making multiple
[24:31] visits to the Upper Midwest Harris
[24:35] inherited Biden's campaign
[24:37] infrastructure including more than 260
[24:40] outposts across the Battleground States
[24:43] in Nevada the Harris campaign has 13
[24:46] field officers to Trump's one in
[24:49] Pennsylvania it has 36 coordinated
[24:52] officers to Trump's 3 according to a
[24:54] campaign memo in the first 12 days of
[24:57] her camp campaign Harris supporters
[25:00] placed 2.3 million phone calls and made
[25:04] 172,000 house visits while Battleground
[25:08] organizers are knocking on swing voters
[25:10] doors the campaign's digital strategy is
[25:14] designed partly around reaching
[25:16] hard-to-reach voters and convincing them
[25:18] to choose between our candidate and the
[25:21] couch says Deputy campaign manager Rob
[25:24] Flaherty the Avalanche of viral memes
[25:27] about Harris the enthusiastic Tik Tok
[25:30] videos and the massive Zoom calls of
[25:32] devoted supporters black women for
[25:35] Harris white dudes for Harris Latino men
[25:38] for Harris have made this task easier
[25:42] that's the kind of enthusiasm that money
[25:44] can't buy Flaherty says but Harris's
[25:47] moment also comes after eight years of
[25:50] transformation and Triumph for American
[25:53] women after Clinton's stinging defeat in
[25:56] 2016
[25:58] women flooded the streets in the largest
[26:01] protest March in US history then formed
[26:04] a massive Grassroots electoral movement
[26:07] that helped Democrats overperform in
[26:10] most elections since the attack lines
[26:14] from the Republicans are going to be on
[26:16] Race and gender and those are going to
[26:19] work to her Advantage says Ashley etn a
[26:23] former communications director for the
[26:25] vice president all that was baggage is
[26:28] is now an
[26:29] asset amen I hope that you have uh
[26:33] listened carefully to that
[26:36] clip and it's all human human human
[26:39] human and
[26:41] um and human cause the fall we know that
[26:47] just if you
[26:50] take
[26:53] Genesis then you'll see the
[26:56] Decay that's brought by a
[26:59] woman woman
[27:01] fell with a
[27:04] silen in Genesis
[27:07] 3:6 lch had two
[27:11] wives Genesis 2 vers 23 which is
[27:16] polygamy it broke down
[27:20] further Genesis 62 they took themselves
[27:25] wives fre sex out of wedlock
[27:31] fornication Genesis
[27:34] 63
[27:36] Abram two
[27:39] wives Genesis
[27:42] 1934 lot
[27:45] SL with his own
[27:48] daughters which is
[27:52] incest
[27:54] Genesis
[27:57] 345 sex of its children D not
[28:01] fell Genesis
[28:04] 195 hos
[28:06] sexuality that is just
[28:09] in
[28:11] Genesis how the
[28:13] moral Decay came just there not even any
[28:19] place else in the Bible just in Genesis
[28:24] and here we have a scenario where it's
[28:27] all
[28:28] woman as I
[28:30] said with the last clip that we put
[28:34] on
[28:35] so we see that this was in Time
[28:42] Magazine time
[28:44] says is this the time brother Bram says
[28:48] so we can say is this the time and
[28:52] season when humans going to cause the
[28:56] fall of the world
[28:58] then the next thing that happens which
[29:01] is
[29:03] ironic the Moon Over
[29:06] Australia they called a blue moon if we
[29:09] can get the right up and the club bar
[29:13] tonight you have the chance to see a
[29:14] rare super Blue Moon just step outside
[29:17] or just watch right here this is a live
[29:18] look right now at the moon shining in
[29:20] the night sky cvsa Jasmine Ramirez joins
[29:23] us in studio right now to tell us why
[29:25] this moon is considered to be so rare
[29:28] yeah that's right Marcel and this live
[29:29] look is pretty great tonight's moon it's
[29:31] supposed to be really bright and really
[29:33] big now having a super Blue Moon just
[29:35] anything like this really it only
[29:37] happens about every 10 years a super
[29:40] blue moon is a Celestial phenomenon
[29:42] tonight it was captured around the globe
[29:44] here you can see it glowing in Turkey
[29:46] Rising into the night sky in Greece
[29:49] shining in Portugal and peeking through
[29:51] the clouds in Australia the big
[29:53] excitement is just for the public to
[29:55] look up see a very bright beautiful full
[29:59] moon tonight I talked with Douglas
[30:01] Leonard a professor of astronomy at San
[30:03] Diego State he says a super moon happens
[30:05] when the moon is at its closest point to
[30:07] the Earth this makes it appear super big
[30:10] and super bright next I asked him what a
[30:12] blue moon is if you happen to have four
[30:15] full moons in one
[30:19] season like
[30:21] summer Okay the third of those full four
[30:24] full moons is called a blue moon so just
[30:27] how how rare is it to have a super blue
[30:29] moon to have a blue moon and which
[30:32] occurs about every every two or 3 years
[30:36] and a super moon which occurs about 25%
[30:39] of the time to have those two things
[30:41] occur together on one full moon happens
[30:44] about every decade and so that's what
[30:46] makes it a bit interesting that's why he
[30:49] recommends going outside and catching a
[30:50] glimpse of it this is such a cool event
[30:52] because it's something that everyone can
[30:54] enjoy that everyone can see easily and
[30:58] appreciate Maxwell palao is an
[30:59] astronomer here in San Diego taking
[31:02] photos of the moon and stars is one of
[31:04] his favorite things to do he has advice
[31:06] if you want to capture tonight's moon
[31:08] but if you really want to capture the
[31:10] best way to do it is to either have a
[31:12] pair of binoculars or a telescope and
[31:14] then put your iPhone or your Android
[31:16] device and put right up against the
[31:18] eyepiece and then take a picture of the
[31:20] Moon it'll look
[31:22] incredible and tonight's clear skies in
[31:24] San Diego will also help give a clear
[31:26] view of the moon now it's best to go
[31:28] outside and see it now I'm told the next
[31:30] Super Blue Moon it likely won't happen
[31:32] until 2037 Marcela that's so interesting
[31:35] so you know you hear the phrases once in
[31:37] a blue moon so that's great that you
[31:39] explained why it's rare to have a super
[31:41] moon and also Blue Moon and then people
[31:43] hear the word blue and they're looking
[31:45] at the photo thinking like does it have
[31:46] a little bit of a blue hue is the moon
[31:49] really blue or why does this you know
[31:52] why is it called a blue moon right no I
[31:54] asked that exact same question I did
[31:56] learn the term Blue Moon is really used
[31:58] to describe the third full moon in a
[32:00] season with four of them now in this
[32:01] case we're having four full moons this
[32:03] summer amen no no why we saw on this is
[32:08] because
[32:10] uh the day that Biden resigned I showed
[32:16] you the very
[32:19] night in New York
[32:23] City
[32:25] around the statue of
[32:28] Liberty she
[32:31] was
[32:33] covered or she's been
[32:37] in or behind
[32:39] her was a red
[32:43] moon why did we have this
[32:48] all at one
[32:51] time and we know what the moon
[32:53] represents when brother BR say Pope went
[32:56] to Israel
[32:58] and he showed you how the moon
[33:01] changed until it blackened out and then
[33:05] too in brandham Tabernacle the angel
[33:07] came down and through the seven Church
[33:10] ages as seven
[33:13] moons and the last one was totally dark
[33:16] and brother Bron put a little light in
[33:18] there that's why it
[33:21] represents the church ages resent
[33:25] represents a woman so why is is it's
[33:30] so
[33:32] explicit this
[33:34] time with the moon does he tell us
[33:40] because as above so
[33:43] below he put those things in the heavens
[33:48] as signs and seasons and Genesis says is
[33:53] this a
[33:54] sign that that woman is going to come in
[33:58] and you could have looked for the this
[34:02] week most of the week we had full full
[34:07] moons so it's so unusual the ordinary
[34:12] Moon full and then you had a blue moon
[34:14] you had a red moon everything is Moon
[34:17] which is a
[34:19] human
[34:21] so could them I'm asking could them
[34:29] be a
[34:31] sign that that woman is
[34:35] here if
[34:37] not you heard they can't even tell you
[34:40] the why of the matter they don't even go
[34:44] back
[34:45] to the the the
[34:48] day uh Biden resigned and there was a
[34:53] red
[34:54] moon
[34:55] so there is Def defitely a
[34:59] significance uh I'm sure if brother
[35:01] Brandon was around he wouldn't have left
[35:03] this thing because it's it's a strange
[35:07] phenomena what we are seeing
[35:11] happening just with the moons so as I
[35:16] said as
[35:18] above so
[35:20] below and then the
[35:22] thing that hit me last week in Monday
[35:28] is the
[35:31] earthquake she nearly
[35:34] went why is all these
[35:37] things right in the circle of
[35:43] Camila and it's been
[35:47] shaking ever
[35:50] since so I
[35:54] thought that we will have the clips
[35:59] um on that
[36:03] Quake watch
[36:18] it oh my
[36:21] [Applause]
[36:36] oh my God oh
[36:39] my oh
[36:45] my oh my God
[37:07] isn't that
[37:09] scary we that know what happened when
[37:13] brother Bram preached on choosing a
[37:19] bride
[37:20] how brother brandham puts this in
[37:24] choosing of a bride just
[37:28] take another listen to it I know you
[37:30] heard this but to see a thing happens
[37:35] and then go back to what brother
[37:37] brandham says in the
[37:39] prophecy it's really shaking I do not
[37:42] know I thank God for this guy that came
[37:44] to me he says you know brother Rosco um
[37:48] the things that you have put out there
[37:50] is really scaring it it it buckles my
[37:54] knees I says not only you my brother
[37:58] I am also shaken to see such a lot of
[38:01] things happen at the same time that
[38:04] speaking
[38:05] about meeting the
[38:08] Messiah you know because the seven
[38:10] Visions is before meeting the Messiah
[38:13] you know the earthquake
[38:16] is I'm going to tell you just now what
[38:19] it is it's also to do with the
[38:22] Messiah listen to how it is put in
[38:26] sincerity
[38:29] from the
[38:31] prophet thou City who claims to be the
[38:35] city of the
[38:36] Angels who's exalted yourself into
[38:39] heaven and sent all the dirty filthy
[38:42] things of Fashions and things the even
[38:44] the foreign countries come here to pick
[38:46] up our filth and send it away with your
[38:49] fine churches and Steeples and so forth
[38:51] the way you do remember one
[38:54] day you will be laying in the bottom
[38:57] botom of the sea you're a great honeycom
[39:01] under you right now the wrath of God is
[39:04] belching right beneath you how much
[39:06] longer you'll hold this sandb hanging
[39:08] out over that on that ocean out under a
[39:10] mile deep will slide in there Plum back
[39:11] to the salt and
[39:15] sea it'll be worse than the last day of
[39:19] pompe repent Los
[39:22] Angeles repent the rest of you and turn
[39:25] to God the hour of his Wrath upon the
[39:27] Earth flee while there's time to flee
[39:31] and come into
[39:33] Christ listen to that
[39:37] voice of
[39:39] urgency of
[39:44] desperation and here Monday it was
[39:48] nearly so nearly the only thing is the
[39:54] sequence that 144,000 has to be
[39:58] sealed and this woman must first come in
[40:03] otherwise Los Angeles would have been
[40:05] gone last week look how it look how it
[40:09] actually went just in the street how
[40:13] those cars were shifting look at the
[40:16] buildings
[40:18] collapsing it was like the
[40:22] africanis umerus nearly nearly gone 4
[40:27] for
[40:29] earthquake
[40:32] so that's what the
[40:34] Bible says as I'm going to read it it's
[40:39] spoken in The Sixth
[40:41] Seal this earthquake Revelation
[40:44] 6:12 a great
[40:47] earthquake then spoken of this of it in
[40:50] the seventh trumpet Revelations 11:13
[40:54] seven trumpet the Seven Seals same thing
[40:58] verse 192 it speaks about it then it
[41:02] speaks about it in the seventh
[41:04] vial the earthquake the biggest
[41:08] earthquake ever Revelation
[41:12] 16:18 then the great quake in Matthew
[41:15] 282 when the graves was
[41:18] open is this what's going to happen when
[41:23] Los Angeles open will Matthew
[41:28] 28 and Matthew 27 51 and 52 when the
[41:34] dead in Christ shall rise with this
[41:37] earthquake will this be like that that's
[41:42] why when I see a thing like this and I
[41:45] see it in the scripture and I see
[41:47] brother brandham say it I have no doubt
[41:51] I don't care what the critic says it's
[41:53] going to come to pass and as I
[41:58] say it nearly
[42:02] happened last
[42:05] week August
[42:08] month so let's take another
[42:11] clip you might be wondering have we been
[42:13] having more of them than normal well we
[42:15] did get the answer for you tonight and
[42:17] it is yes we are having the most
[42:19] seismically active year in almost four
[42:22] decades and experts say the shaking is
[42:24] likely to continue another earthquake
[42:26] hit Southern California
[42:27] this time near Lake Elenor it happened
[42:29] this morning around 9:30 the magnitude
[42:32] 3.9 earthquake rocked homes but so far
[42:35] no damage has been reported this is the
[42:37] third sizable earthquake in Southern
[42:39] California in just a couple of days
[42:41] Southern California has experienced
[42:43] multiple earthquakes this week as I'm
[42:45] sure all of you know and this is a good
[42:46] reminder now is the time to prepare for
[42:49] an even larger one through the
[42:50] Northridge Earthquake so you know the
[42:53] first thing I said is I think the big
[42:55] one's coming guys Judith gold the owner
[42:57] of Luca natural goods and Highland Park
[43:00] remembers the progression of smaller
[43:02] Quakes leading up to a very destructive
[43:06] one I know that this is the signs that a
[43:09] bigger earthquake is probably going to
[43:11] come I mean I hope I'm wrong it passes
[43:14] us but it usually that's how it was um
[43:17] before the nor northri earthquake some
[43:18] breaking news of 4.4 earthquake hitting
[43:21] the Las Vegas Valley tonight according
[43:23] to USGS Quake hit about 806 about 4
[43:26] miles Northwest of Indian Springs Nevada
[43:28] the Quake was 5.8 Mi deep Indian Springs
[43:31] is home to Cree Air Force Base is 45 Mi
[43:34] Northwest of the Las Vegas Strip there
[43:37] were no immediate reports of any
[43:38] injuries or damage as you'd expect of a
[43:40] quake of this size but it was felt in a
[43:43] wide area of Nevada the recent
[43:45] earthquake that jolted the Southland is
[43:46] sparking concern and highlighting a much
[43:49] smaller but potentially more threatening
[43:51] fault line the fault running from the
[43:53] Pasadena area to Puente Hills has been
[43:56] very very active in recent months all
[43:58] the way over in Santa Monica a cam
[44:01] facing the pier shows the power of the
[44:02] large shocks well so far there's been a
[44:04] few after shocks but nothing significant
[44:06] two months ago there was actually a
[44:08] smaller quick That Shook that exact same
[44:10] area here in La a lot more recently and
[44:13] did feel a few of those but not nothing
[44:15] that strong as what we just felt in
[44:17] South PAAD from 2013 to 2023 Dr Jones
[44:20] says there was an average of five
[44:22] magnitude four or stronger shakers but
[44:25] 2024 has been a lot more volatile
[44:28] already this year there have been 13
[44:31] magnitude 4 or stronger Quakes this year
[44:34] is now an active year again 2024 has had
[44:37] more earthquakes than any year we've
[44:40] seen since 1988 here's seismologist Dr
[44:43] Lucy Jones we had a six on this on this
[44:46] system in
[44:47] 1987 and it was like 350 million doll in
[44:51] damage and three direct deaths so when
[44:54] we've modeled what would it be like to
[44:56] have a 7 and a half on the penty Hills
[44:58] thrust we get 10 times as much damage as
[45:01] we see for a 7.9 on the San Andreas
[45:04] because we have so many more buildings
[45:06] and people on top of an earthquake if
[45:08] it's pente Hills Monday's 4.4 magnitude
[45:11] earthquake happened in the same area as
[45:13] a 3.4 magnitude earthquake June 2nd and
[45:17] both produced aftershocks nearby so
[45:20] they're all in about the same location
[45:22] uh within somewhere within the Plenty
[45:25] Hills thrust system so what should the
[45:28] everyday californi take from that not
[45:30] much we have earthquakes this is a great
[45:32] reminder that all of Southern California
[45:34] is earthqu country every one of us in
[45:37] the Los Angeles metropolitan area is
[45:40] within 5 miles of an active fault and
[45:43] which one of those are going to go
[45:44] within our lifetime is random scientists
[45:47] at Yellowstone National Park telling us
[45:49] this was a random event happening
[45:51] without warning some wild new vide
[45:53] showing an explosion at Yellowstone
[45:55] National Park a geyser going off sending
[45:58] tourists running for
[46:03] cover run run
[46:05] run Park officials closed the biscuit
[46:08] Basin area while they surveyed the
[46:10] damage the area is home to several
[46:12] geysers in pools including the sapphire
[46:14] pool which had a similar eruption in
[46:17] 1991 what happened is that an unusual
[46:20] event where a lot of pressure built up
[46:22] and with that so much pressure it again
[46:25] forced its way out it erupted officials
[46:28] say there did not appear to be any signs
[46:30] of an imminent volcanic eruption well
[46:33] that's good news geologists are
[46:35] investigating what exactly happened the
[46:37] scientist in charge with the Yellowstone
[46:39] volcano Observatory says this is not
[46:42] connected to volcanic activity which is
[46:45] often associated with the part well
[46:47] David scientists at Yellowstone tell us
[46:49] that this was a random event without
[46:51] warning still they are investigating
[46:53] exactly what happened and what it might
[46:54] mean for the future of this area David
[46:56] the last time an explosion similar to
[46:58] this happened at Yellowstone's biscuit
[47:01] Basin was back in 2009 yeah that was
[47:03] really something to see MOA thank you
[47:07] amen isn't it
[47:10] scary doesn't that
[47:14] shake a
[47:17] religious
[47:20] conceptions and
[47:22] arguments to put it one side and
[47:26] concentrate
[47:28] on
[47:30] Modern
[47:31] events that prophecy is making clear
[47:37] that we that is in this
[47:40] message we that's walking in this
[47:42] message for over 56
[47:46] years heard and quoted these things time
[47:50] and time and time again but here it's
[47:54] upon us
[47:57] even the scientist doesn't know
[47:59] when but a scary point is 2024 why
[48:06] 2024 Kam's
[48:09] here the earthquakes
[48:11] has has actually tripled
[48:16] up so where are we
[48:19] at so El Tabernacle as your pastor I
[48:24] cannot help
[48:27] but put it in front in front of you I
[48:30] cannot bring something
[48:32] positive but a negative
[48:36] thing for what I see because I'm am
[48:40] reminded of what brother brandham
[48:45] says this earth needs a funeral service
[48:48] to be preached to and if there ever was
[48:52] a time that this earth needs a funeral
[48:55] service is now
[48:57] and wake up
[48:59] people to the
[49:01] fact that
[49:03] hey is no more F in the future it's on
[49:08] our
[49:09] doorstep it's right
[49:12] here we
[49:15] cannot try and put this thing under the
[49:19] carpet
[49:20] anymore it is staring us right in the
[49:25] face so
[49:28] so I
[49:30] thought that that would be a good
[49:34] thing then I ask you with a combin see
[49:38] that you finished pay your
[49:41] credits
[49:43] why
[49:46] because in Genesis
[49:49] 47:15 money failed in the land of
[49:54] Egypt we know that that is part and
[49:58] parcel of Camila coming in she's going
[50:02] to let America get busted
[50:06] up we know that brother Brenham said
[50:09] that in Statue of a perfect man and it's
[50:13] funny whenever you have a perfect man
[50:16] money goes in Genesis you had Joseph a
[50:19] perfect man and money
[50:22] failed when Jesus came and money was the
[50:26] issue 30 pieces of silver the Rich Young
[50:30] Ruler you know and um a laborous worth
[50:35] his wage and all those things it's
[50:37] always money when a perfect man comes is
[50:41] there another perfect man
[50:44] now that we see money is
[50:47] falling I think so I think that there is
[50:51] a bride that's nearly near
[50:54] Perfection when God is going to let
[50:57] money fail again now let us
[51:02] again listen to brother
[51:06] brandham Lifeline the other morning well
[51:09] you know it's just like you sell Bonds
[51:11] on the go the bonds is already tuck up
[51:13] and this present government now is
[51:16] spending money for what for tax money
[51:20] that they'll be cut in 40 years from now
[51:24] she's done that's Lifeline right out of
[51:26] Washington
[51:27] DC Across the Nation taxes they're
[51:30] spending and trying to buy forign well
[51:33] they're just giving it out anyway don't
[51:35] you see that's exactly what they what
[51:37] they're going to
[51:38] do see what is it now if this nation
[51:42] goes busted the only thing it can do is
[51:44] go busted the only thing it can do is go
[51:47] bankrupt that's the only sensible thing
[51:49] to do change the currency but they won't
[51:52] do it under this presid Administration
[51:54] Roman Catholic Church owns a gold the
[51:56] world and what they'll do is sell
[52:00] out there you
[52:02] are that's what I am looking for now if
[52:08] you are
[52:10] spiritual you see what I'm going to say
[52:15] now kamla Harris is the first Domin
[52:19] Domino to fall you know if that first
[52:22] Domino Falls all the dominoes is falling
[52:27] so we waiting for that first
[52:29] Domino and when we see that all these
[52:32] things earthquakes and Pope and all that
[52:36] then comes into view that all of them
[52:40] isn't going to fall under the prophecy
[52:44] of one of the
[52:45] greatest prophets that ever struck the
[52:49] globe outside of Jesus Christ William
[52:53] mam branam may God bless his heart
[52:57] for giving us the signs of the time and
[53:04] taking all his
[53:07] time and go to Los Angeles and all those
[53:10] places to drop the prophecies that his
[53:14] master gave him
[53:17] so this is all
[53:19] prophecies hanging in the balance it's
[53:22] hanging there will she or Trump
[53:27] fulfill the prophecies will it
[53:30] be it's like a Dustin
[53:34] drum now
[53:36] beating is this behold I come
[53:40] quickly and my reward is with
[53:44] me Revelations 8:13 is then the next
[53:48] thing woe wo
[53:52] wo inhabitants of the earth three woes
[53:56] three world wars will that
[54:01] follow the first war the trumpet blew
[54:04] and got Israel
[54:06] back the second world world
[54:10] war was even worse and More in
[54:15] 1946
[54:17] actually was going back and Israel
[54:20] became a
[54:21] nation and the third war is the atomic
[54:26] bomb
[54:27] that
[54:29] explodes and not only destroy America
[54:33] but the whole
[54:35] world Revelations
[54:37] 9:12 one war is passed One World War and
[54:43] behold there is
[54:46] coming actually two more WS Revelations
[54:53] 11:14 the second W is passed
[54:57] in other words the second world war is
[55:00] passed and behold the third world cometh
[55:03] quickly the third world war is come in
[55:08] quickly while the human is
[55:11] here Revelations
[55:14] 12:12 woe to the
[55:17] inhabitants of the
[55:20] earth woe unto us that's going to remain
[55:23] behind when that atomic bomb
[55:27] blast
[55:28] out so that's why I said three quarters
[55:34] of the six prophecy is fulfilled three
[55:39] qu quarters of it a woman as vice
[55:42] president fulfilled a woman's vote will
[55:45] put a in that seems also fulfilled Woman

[56:04] woman tough as Nails fulfilled already
[56:08] woman will rule America she's ruling
[56:11] them now with even abortion it's three
[56:15] quarters fulfilled already we're waiting
[56:18] to see if she's going to do to be voted
[56:23] in the last thing that that must happen
[56:27] that last quarter will it be like that
[56:32] when all the others is already fulfill
[56:35] it will take a
[56:38] miracle for that not to happen if the
[56:43] other things already in the court has
