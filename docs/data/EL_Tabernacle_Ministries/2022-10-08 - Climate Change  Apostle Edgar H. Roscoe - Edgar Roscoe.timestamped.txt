[0:01] climate change
[0:03] from the two scriptures
[0:06] climate
[0:07] change
[0:10] the world is falling apart
[0:16] the world is falling apart
[0:20] that means that there is without a shed
[0:24] of a doubt
[0:25] that the world is going to have a
[0:29] traumatic
[0:31] climate change
[0:34] which they have never seen before
[0:40] we
[0:42] want to always know what is in the
[0:46] future
[0:47] what is there to follow
[0:52] covered 19. it is unequivocal that human
[0:57] activities are responsible for climate
[0:59] change that's the finding of a new study
[1:02] by the un's intergovernmental panel on
[1:04] climate change it's the most up-to-date
[1:07] assessment of how global warming will
[1:09] change the world in the coming decades
[1:12] environmental experts have called it a
[1:14] massive wake-up call to governments to
[1:16] cut emissions
[1:18] 234 authors from 66 countries have
[1:22] worked on the landmark assessment
[1:24] the report says global average
[1:26] temperature rise could reach or exceed
[1:29] 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next 20 years
[1:33] now that is 10 years sooner than
[1:36] expected that temperature rise will
[1:38] breach the ambition of the 2015 Paris
[1:41] climate agreement and bring widespread
[1:44] Devastation and unprecedented extreme
[1:46] weather
[1:48] this all comes less than three months
[1:50] before the cop 26 climate conference in
[1:52] Glasgow in Scotland vital un talks that
[1:56] will determine the future course of
[1:57] efforts to tackle climate change
[2:00] and the UK Minister responsible for
[2:02] delivering cop 26 has released this
[2:06] statement following the publication of
[2:08] today's report he says our message to
[2:11] every country government business and
[2:14] part of society is simple the next
[2:17] decade is decisive follow the science
[2:19] and embrace your responsibility to keep
[2:22] the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius alive
[2:25] our environment and energy analyst Roger
[2:28] harobin has more
[2:32] wildfires blazing through Greece and
[2:34] Turkey have horrified people in the
[2:36] region the panel concludes we'll see a
[2:39] lot more fires as temperatures continue
[2:41] to rise
[2:42] and Rise they will as greenhouse gas
[2:44] emissions keep growing and growing
[2:47] The increased heat will change weather
[2:49] patterns bringing more droughts and more
[2:52] rainfall researchers say
[2:54] London was shocked to find areas
[2:56] underwater a few weeks ago
[2:58] rainfall patterns are hard to predict
[3:00] but experts say northern Europe will be
[3:03] wetter overall
[3:05] at London's Hampstead ponds they've
[3:07] already had to raise and reinforce the
[3:10] dams to protect hundreds of homes
[3:13] Downstream from the sort of floods
[3:15] expected in extreme rains that are
[3:17] forecast to come
[3:19] the cost has been huge
[3:21] we're already paying the price of
[3:23] ignoring scientists warnings on climate
[3:26] change
[3:27] so this report States as an absolute
[3:29] fact that human influence is warming the
[3:32] climate and that's a very Stark reminder
[3:35] that it is our activities which are
[3:38] changing the climate and affecting these
[3:41] extreme weather events
[3:43] um and as the planet continues to warm
[3:45] these consequences just get worse
[3:49] ice in the Arctic is melting faster than
[3:52] many scientists predicted that leads to
[3:55] sea level rise which in turn increases
[3:57] coastal flooding
[3:59] the Seas will keep Rising for maybe
[4:01] thousands of years because the ocean
[4:03] deep has absorbed so much heat already
[4:07] political attitudes are changing the UK
[4:09] is getting electric cars we need clean
[4:12] technology for home heating too
[4:15] in the words of one leading scientist
[4:17] we're not doomed but if we want to avoid
[4:20] catastrophe we have to drastically cut
[4:22] emissions now
[4:24] Roger harobin BBC News
[4:28] Valerie Masson delmot is a climate
[4:30] scientist and co-chair of one of the
[4:33] ipcc working groups which produce the
[4:35] Climate Change Report she said the
[4:38] threshold of keeping the global
[4:39] temperature at 1.5 degrees Celsius limit
[4:42] will be breached around 2050.
[4:45] the report shows that in the next 20
[4:48] years global warming the average
[4:51] temperature at the Earth's surface over
[4:54] a period of 20 euros is expected to
[4:58] reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius
[5:01] above the late 1800s however if we
[5:06] rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions
[5:09] if we can reach global net zero CO2
[5:12] emissions around 2050.
[5:15] it is extremely likely that we can keep
[5:17] global warming well below 2 degrees
[5:21] if we do this it is more likely than not
[5:24] that temperature would gradually decline
[5:26] to below or around 1.5 degrees Celsius
[5:30] by the end of the century with a
[5:33] temporary overshoot of no more than 0.1
[5:36] degrees Celsius
[5:38] but if Global greenhouse gas emissions
[5:41] remain around today's levels in the
[5:44] coming decades we would reach two
[5:46] degrees of global warming by the middle
[5:49] of this century
[5:52] we joined Now by Tamsin Edwards a
[5:54] climate scientist and one of the authors
[5:56] of this report welcome to BBC News I
[5:59] know your area of expertise is the
[6:01] oceans and sea level change and in fact
[6:03] you spent three years
[6:05] investigating this haven't haven't you
[6:07] so it would be remiss of me not to um
[6:10] find out more about that what did you
[6:14] find exactly
[6:16] well that's right we have over 200
[6:19] authors
[6:20] um in the whole report we have uh looked
[6:22] at 14
[6:24] 000 scientific studies over three years
[6:26] and I work on ice sheets and sea level
[6:29] rise as you say we don't do new research
[6:32] we assess the robustness of the evidence
[6:34] so for example for the Antarctic ice
[6:37] sheet we looked at the range of
[6:39] possibilities of the future of the ice
[6:41] sheet and therefore its contribution to
[6:43] sea level rise and one of your findings
[6:45] is that the melting of Greenland
[6:48] glaciers is irreversible am I right
[6:52] well that's right so there are different
[6:54] parts of um there are different uh Ice
[6:57] uh regions around the world we have the
[6:59] glaciers of the mountains and the polar
[7:01] regions and we have the great ice sheets
[7:03] of Greenland and Antarctica the mountain
[7:06] and polar glasses are particularly
[7:07] sensitive and we have already committed
[7:10] to further melting over the next decades
[7:13] to hundreds of years we're also going to
[7:16] see more ice loss from the Greenland ice
[7:19] sheet over the next Century over this
[7:22] century and for the Antarctic ice sheet
[7:24] there's a really wide range of
[7:25] possibilities if we limit greenhouse gas
[7:28] emissions we may be fortunate and have a
[7:31] relatively low contribution to sea level
[7:32] rise but if we have very high greenhouse
[7:35] gas emissions and we're unlucky with how
[7:37] sensitive that ice sheet is we could see
[7:40] very high sea level rise indeed so at my
[7:43] right that the message is there's no
[7:45] going back from some change once they've
[7:47] melted they can't be refrozen I assume
[7:49] but there is a core optimism that this
[7:54] could be slowed or indeed even halted or
[7:57] is that putting it too optimistically
[7:59] we think that the the mountain and polar
[8:02] the mountain and polar Glaciers are
[8:03] these smaller glaciers and also Arctic
[8:05] sea ice um could have some reversible
[8:08] changes so if we limit warming and
[8:10] eventually reduce uh temperatures
[8:12] further that those could regrow and
[8:15] restore to some degree the ice sheets
[8:18] are much slower to respond so Greenland
[8:20] and Antarctica will keep responding for
[8:24] hundreds if not thousands of years and
[8:26] combined with the warming of the ocean
[8:28] which makes it expand and contribute to
[8:30] sea level rise that means sea levels are
[8:32] going to remain elevated for thousands
[8:34] of years I was very struck by what Inga
[8:38] Anderson said the executive director of
[8:40] the UN environment program she said
[8:43] scientists have been telling us for over
[8:44] three decades of the dangers of allowing
[8:46] the planet to warm the world listened
[8:49] but did not hear and I wondered do you
[8:53] think
[8:54] government and people will
[8:58] it's a difference isn't it between
[9:00] taking any notice of this and doing
[9:02] something about it
[9:04] of course I mean speaking personally you
[9:06] know I I do sense a real shift in the in
[9:09] the conversation over the last few years
[9:11] but I think what this um ipcc assessment
[9:14] report shows it's much more
[9:15] comprehensive than ever before assessed
[9:18] more of the scientific evidence than
[9:19] ever before obviously the timing with
[9:21] respect to the cop 26 meeting later this
[9:24] year it really shows that if we do have
[9:27] immediate rapid and large-scale
[9:30] reductions in greenhouse gas emissions
[9:32] we can still limit warming to one and a
[9:35] half degrees uh above the sort of late
[9:37] 1800s as we've heard without much
[9:39] overshoot and eventually go to lower
[9:41] warming again but if we don't
[9:44] um enact the policies and pledges that
[9:46] we already have in place and in fact if
[9:49] we don't make those stronger then we
[9:51] won't meet that Target but what are your
[9:54] conclusions about reducing those
[9:56] greenhouse gas emissions and keeping
[9:58] temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius
[10:00] above pre-industrial levels Can it can
[10:03] it be done
[10:05] well this particular part of the ipcc
[10:08] report is called the working group one
[10:09] report which is around the science of
[10:11] climate change and so we looked at
[10:12] different scenarios of emissions and
[10:15] what that would mean for climate change
[10:17] what we need to look out for next year
[10:19] is the third working group which looks
[10:21] at mitigation in other words where are
[10:24] those emissions coming from what are the
[10:25] different Pathways to cutting those
[10:27] emissions so that will give much more of
[10:29] that detail about exactly the how of
[10:32] cutting emissions whereas what this
[10:34] report is doing is showing the
[10:35] implications of very low emissions or
[10:38] medium intermediate emissions or very
[10:40] high what that actually implies for the
[10:42] extreme weather for the sea level rise
[10:44] and other changes in climate no I
[10:47] understand that's really useful tams in
[10:48] Edwards climate scientist at King's
[10:50] College London and one of the authors of
[10:52] the report thanks so much for your time
[10:54] so what can be next after covert
[10:58] that is the problem
[11:00] what is going to be next
[11:02] after
[11:04] this news flesh
[11:08] the biggest thing that must happen is
[11:11] climate change then the coming of the
[11:13] Lord
[11:14] amen
