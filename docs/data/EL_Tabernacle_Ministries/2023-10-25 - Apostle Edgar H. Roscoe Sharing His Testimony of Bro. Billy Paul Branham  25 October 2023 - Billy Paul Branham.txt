one another's hand I don't [Music] believe [Music] [Applause] amen [Applause] amen let us pray our heavenly God the one that nobody could ever understand but he makes his ways known to them that love him we come to you tonight Lord [Music] speak about a testimony that's been the MST us I I ask that you would undertake for us as there's a lot of question marks around the world right now about this episode that is transpired question marks doubt and even people leaving the message but I thank you great one for for this [Applause] place where you can give us understanding and knowledge to handle whatever comes our way I pray that you died me behind the Cross pray that you would open minds I pray that you would concrete [Applause] Faith what we believe I ask it in your blessed name amen amen now I'm just going to testify tonight I'm not here to preach if I do forgive me but I'd like to just lay down a testimony and um as things are boiling outside there of what has happened I would lay down my testimony and then afterwards try and go into uh the problematic thing that's hindering people so my testimony on Billy Paul [Applause] Brenham he was the first one to call me his friend so brother Rosco you are my friend and tonight I'd like to speak about my [Applause] friend when I found uh brother Keith in Cape Town we came back and I wanted to know how things are and then the first words that he uted to me was U do you know how that man loved you I said yes kid I know he said but but do you really know in other words I said yes I know cuz he wrote to me and uh I felt it on my heart seeing those question marks or just to go through some things I I've been around him and then uh the main thing is he's death now and those angels are still standing how do you get around it amen so you may be be seated I'm not going to look for amens or nothing I'm just testifying okay I also have a testimony so uh Daniel gave me a scripture which I would like to read um proverbs 10:7 the memory of the just is blessed am the memory of the just is blessed and I would include right in there I remember Bly Paul in a happy way cuz his memories that I carry is surely blessed I believe that some people was asking isn't brother rosar going to say something about Billy Paul they wanted to know if I'm going to say something about brother luck and I didn't because I didn't feel for it I didn't feel like wasting time it's a waste of time but but I feel to say something about Billy Paul you may be [Applause] seated his name carries two Church Church age Messengers combined in [Applause] one Bly is the name for William am if your name is William in the states they call you bu amen so his name is Bully which means brother brand the last Church age messenger and Paul the first church H [Applause] messeng so brother Brena took the two names and splice it together and called him the first and the last Messengers names his mother's name was hope that was his first Union and she died when she was very very very young and brother Bram tells you how he had to carry bully all over and keep the bottle here in his to keep it warm for Bully to drink so bully was without a mother since a young young age and Sarah Rose also died Bully's only sister died at the same time sister hope died and brother brandham didn't want to marry again and the angel of the Lord told him because of the days are so bad that um woman has gone on the Rampage he says You must get married and while God was speaking to him God was speaking to his second wife and he told his second wife behold I'll send you [Applause] [Music] Elijah and one day brother brandham got bully and he said you know bully you had a queen of a mother hope she was a queen she was just something extraordinary she was not maybe a woman she was a lady and all that she wanted to see is success for a husband brother brandham and I think that's why bully was so over brother brandham you can't say anything negative in Bully's presence about his father he was the best friend to his dad and I I always admired that by him what Dad said is yeah and amen settles [Applause] it and Bully couldn't preach because of the marriage and divorce case he had and I watched him all the years he would never go in and go PR because Dad said so he always said I'm a testimony he always said I'm I'm carrying the biscuits to the Brethren brother brandham baked the biscuits but he said he took the biscuits to give it to the brethren so those are the things that I hold dear about bullying and I had the privilege for being in his company quite a few times I do not think there's a South African guy or Minister that had the Privileges I had and therefore I was so rugged in what I believe that they couldn't change my mind at all I know where I am called [Applause] in and um I will always be grateful to God that I had those privileges with brother bully the first time I met him was in 1977 he took me around Jeff took me to the Ohio River his father baptized the 17th person it took me to Spring Street and um he took me to eat at the restaurant brother Bram used to like to go to he took me to the shop where brother BR used to buy that sweets that strong sweets and he bought me a packet he took me to the grave of brother brandham I wouldn't say what happened there he took me to his mother's um grave sister hope he took me to the tour through the church brandham Tabernacle Church because the evening I testified in the church there that's when that guy walked up and told me for all these years we only felt the same anointing that was upon brother Brandon that was on you that was the time and then you know what he gave he gave me and um then he showed me The Minister's room where brother Brandon first went in before he went into the pulpit and in The Minister's room he told me he said uh uh brother Edgar you see this Photograph I said yes I see the photograph he says to me um that photo brother Coleman gave brother brandham and when I looked at the photo God bless you brother when I looked at the photo I saw it was Elijah leaving and brother Brenham hanged it right in he studied there before going into the pit and then without Ado I told Brother Coleman I saw them photograph that you sent brother uh the prophet and then brother Coleman gave me the testimony of the photo somebody drew it painted it and uh and he told me who gave it to him when he received it and looked at it the inspiration of God fell on him brother Coleman and told the inspiration told Brother Coleman wrap it up and send it to my prophet and brother Coleman took the photo wrapped it up and sent it to brother Brenham and without Ado brother Ram took the photo and hanged it in that room it's still there today and um it wasn't long then Elijah did leave and I remember brother K said when when brother random died he walked into the pulit that morning and preach on the shout of the king is in the camp so don't be dismayed the messenger is gone but the shout of the king is in the [Applause] C so many will see that photo but they wouldn't know the history behind it the next meeting with Billy Paul was in Oklahoma after the meetings that I preach we had a lunch together Billy Paul his wife brother Coleman sister Elaine Musgrove his wife and me and my wife we sat at one table and at together and U after we finish at brother bik Paul remain seated and everybody left and me and my wife got up and I said bu I have to go over to the French people there because I was flying to Paris from New York and um bu he kept on sitting I spoke to the guys from France me my wife and as we came back I had to pass B Paul cuz he was still sitting and he had some papers or whatever it is in his hand and you know and when I came close to him he jumped in front of me and my wife and he said um brother Rosco I need to tell you something and I was shocked now keman told me a few things about bully which I already picked up there I knew what it what's coming but I I was praying that it was something good and not some little devil hiding somewhere that he's going to pull out you understand how it is is when you come into the into the presence of a man of God you always have question marks hey uh he mustn't see you know my ugly [Applause] side we all have ugly sides and he told me he says brother Rosco I just want to tell you that um since I saw the angel of the Lord I said oh oh he says since I saw the angel of the Lord he left me with a gift to discern ministers I said okay so I will really know who I am and then he said brother Ros I have discerned you and I want to tell you that you have one of the best Spirits among all the ministers I ever met in this [Applause] message me and my wife's knees buckled and we said we're going to keep that one for the Millennium that me and my wife is going to talk it over how he felt when he said [Applause] that and he just said that and and and and and he left me and he walked out and uh we were really shocked when my wife we stood stood there and uh we walked out and right in the corner there brother Coleman was standing and when we started to walk out brother Coleman ran over and he says come on brother Rosco come on what did bully tell you I said um yeah you did he said I know I I was watching the whole thing when he had his stuff there and he was sitting there I knew he was Discerning one of us and he discerned you and then I gave brother colan the story but I thought it's going to end right there but it didn't end there him and um Joseph came to South Africa and they asked me to take them around so when he came to South Africa I picked them up with um Theo Erasmus and then he said brother Rosco I want to go to the hotel where I saw the angel now look how he hooks the thing up he waited I took him to the hotel he says that angel just stood here and he went through it you know the story and uh he said do you know why he said wake up your son to see me and not no no no these young pastors know nothing man must come to the Elder the Elder will tell them and he said you know why brother Rosco I said no he says on our way down to Cape Town just before CS door there was popular trees there they cut it off now just before you get into clar do brother Bram told him to stop the car and he got out and he went over to that popular of trees and he plucked off the branches and he threw the branches in front of them on their feet and he says thus sayeth the Lord I'm not supposed to go he was not supposed to go to Cape Town he was not supposed to go to csor that's why we never built a church in clor but in porch and um then you know what he said What The Minister's done wake up that brother there right next to you yeah yeah you slap like there and um he says and I told my dad I says Dad can I tell you something he says yes he says let's book our tickets back why should we listen to these ministers let's listen to God and let's go [Applause] back don't listen to this Minister's day he says and when they came back to jobber the why of the matter why he and not his brother was woken up to see the angel was because bully said let us not listen to the ministers don't listen to a minister that don't have the Holy [Applause] Ghost and he said dad told me that that pleased the angel so that I could see that angel brother osar he stood right here and he went right through the window gone and you know he described the angel exactly dark [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] skin and you hooked Oklahoma up with Joe to make sure that I understood What's Happening Now how could I listen to these past yeah want to tell me something I don't care about that I heard straight from the angel of the Lord and straight from Brother brandham when you laid hands on my head I don't listen to No Minister you're not on my level and I will never listen to [Applause] you what a testimony that [Applause] is if you look deep into this story here what he says since the angel left him he got discernment so I look deep into the thing I feel that the angel told him sit there and tell him who he is how else could it be and he sat and he waited for me and told me who I am if you have the right Spirit you have the right word I would rather be right in my spirit and wrong in my Doctrine and here's Al Tabernacle why because the blessing is on [Applause] somebody now how could guy a guy a simple black guy like this African boy have a blessing from a prophet and a prophet son that saw the [Applause] angel tell me which which black guy up Africa way can have a testimony like this [Applause] n okay that's why I can't listen to anybody brother Brown says this boy will preach exactly what I preach Billy PA said this boy has got a nicer Spirit among the Ministries he'll preach exactly the word mechanics buly comes he says you have the best Spirit Dynamics Dynamics mechanics together is that my [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Ministry then then to you El Tabernacle look I'm responsible for you I'm not responsible for anybody else you pay me your ti [Music] so I need to look after [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you so I carry a heavy testimony and I can't come down that's why I'm so robust [Applause] on another meeting in Oklahoma I was cautioned by the Holy Ghost there's a trap set for me I stayed in a hotel room just went down into the now by the way the the the the hotel that brother R stayed in here they broke it down was an old old hotel and I'm so glad that it was still standing when bll and them came and I could take them there you know um the meeting was tight in Oklahoma it was stuff and Coin and I'm didn't know what to do many of times uh in Forest Hill brother K's church when I come then there is nothing I sat in a in a in a in a Minister's room and K will tell me just go up and talk and leave that people don't want to serve God and then uh Joey bomo will come down and said brother Rosco you're not going to get these people right and then I said I just thought well we'll see and then I went up and I think within 15 minutes the church was mixed up it's going on [Music] this and you you heard the statement brother Coleman said he said brother Rosco you can put brother Rosco in the middle of a graveyard you heard him say that so after he preached the dead will raise up and clap their [Applause] hands now again the the the the convention was really tight and dry and um Bly and them was there with his son and uh I went in and uh I commended and thank bully and said bully we're really glad for you and your family and many of days you were without the father so that your father can fathered us so many a days you didn't have somebody to guide you CU you W home but you were busy guiding this bride I said bully many a days you might have weeped and cried for dad while your dad was preaching to us and we were weeping and crying in front of God I said [Applause] bully today because of your dad I can live of tithes that your dad's labors brought to me I'm not worthy it's your father's tithes that I'm living on so I'm living actually of your money Bly and buly and them was crying and I started to preach and the deacons were standing you know how K posted these Deacons and uh when I was about a half an hour in I looked around and the deacons was crying standing and the tears was running all of [Applause] them all of them I then left the poopit I went up because I needed to change and uh I ran down because I wanted to speak to norga from Tucson and just before he pulled away Coleman was standing there say Isaac save Journey my brother he says yeah he says brother keman I just want to tell you something and brother keman says what he said you know where to put this guy where to preach when your meetings is dying then you know there's a Rosco that can pick it [Music] up what a [Applause] testimony and then when I went back I just see somebody jump into the lift and says brother Rosco there was a trap set for you here because I had a dream that you were going to bomb this place to pieces I had a dream but I must tell you it was from the devil because it was just the opposite and they still don't know that I know but that's when you got the Holy Ghost he [Applause] Wars then I heard bully tell somebody that you know today well brother OS was preaching my son received the Holy [Applause] Ghost the other time I preached and met bully was when I preached on identification and this message is on tape uh you know the message and after I preach as usual the Holy Ghost filled the house you can hear Brother Coleman tell brother bully bully isn't this it's right on tape isn't this the same anointing that was with your father buly rais his hand up and he [Applause] says I remember buly in a happy [Applause] [Music] [Applause] way after the meeting bully met me before we went in for lunch and he said to me brother Rosco you brought it [Applause] [Music] I remember bully in a happy [Applause] way and after this meeting was when he sent me the letter and they stole the letter in Zimbabwe with my Bible funny they didn't steal anything else in the car I had a Bible like this my name printed on and the letter was in there and I just took the Bible with the letter when they broke into the car but I ready to the church I ready to the elders I ready to the Deacons and the Rasmus read the letter and uh in the letter he asked me to send him the cloud picture with hopman's head in [Applause] Christ and then he said brother Ros will you be so kind and S Joseph one too so in other words send us two one for Joseph one for me and I send it off to them the next thing in the letter was he called me Edgar my friend I'm glad I have friends I don't have to go make friends I don't need friends I the best of the [Applause] best as a friend and in the letter he says you know but he told me this after the meeting too he says I just like to listen to you but in the letter he said I only listen to you and my dad no other [Applause] minister yes I remember bully in a happy way [Applause] the Rasmus read the letter and he gave the letter back to me he says now can I add to that letter I says yeah well add brother Theo he says I would put them down there the greatest charismatic preacher in the message and that the message ever saw is you brother rosar not F Edgar [Applause] OS now we're coming to the close here a buly Paul died and as I said there such a lot of things going on lot of people talking a lot of people criticizing a lot of people ready to leave the message again the churches has gone small as I told you on sister Sunday Monday was it Monday Monday it's going to be worse now but elter I want to tell you that you have a man of God in a poop [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] w [Applause] I ain't going [Applause] [Music] nowhere [Applause] brother bully died remember to be spiritual now I'm asking you to be spiritual now just a little thing can throw you out and offboard amen and make you believe some fault things just a little thing that's overlooked in the scripture can throw you way back in the world therefore a pastor must be very sensitive to the word of God now this thing of bully Paul in Los Angeles a small thing in that quote can make you give up deny the message reject the message reject brother brandham and yet brother brandham says sometimes things got to be said so that some may flock away exactly but El Tabernacle you're not going to flock away I am standing right there I will stop you from fing [Applause] away just a little thing that you miss in the scriptures will make you backslide or leave the message so your leader must be very spiritual because God is pruned to hide things he likes to do it he likes to do things to make you like [Music] [Applause] this one time brother Brandon was waiting for a vision to get fulfilled and he waited and he know everything was settled everything was said there and uh he was wondering now what what is wrong that thing had to break and you know what was wrong a hat was not on the on the right place a hat so a hat so perfect is your God how can we ever be [Applause] God little thing small thing ahead everything must be lined up then God moves why because the Song of Solomon Chapter 2:1 15 says it's the little foxes that spoils the vine that little intri that make you miss [Applause] God so here is a little thing that causing the stumbling block and people wanting to leave the message and as I said I'm responsible for El Tabernacle only I'm going to give an account of this what I see amen now watch be alert with every problem in this message 20 some OD years ago I found the answer to every problem that's why we could never go wrong and I'm going to tell you the [Applause] problem you want to know the problem you did hear it before but in the light that it is now you'll know it even the better amen okay let's go to 1963 721 he cares do you listen to the message he cares do you care it was on Luther King brother Braham says he's going to lead thousands of people to their death and it didn't happen and this guy wrote to brother brandham says did you prophesy because Martin Luther King just died and this is what brother brandham had to say have we got it brother listen to what he says he says now see listen listen to this now see I've always asked you to be careful little things be careful amen what you're listening to see that's Point number one he is educating the bride now to be careful what are you listening to have you got that point let's go on with that quote point two not everything is thus sayth the Lord that I say so brother brandham when he speak is not everything is thus sayth the Lord amen oh my when brother BR say throw that ball is that that say the Lord not everything he said now I didn't say it brother brandham said it and if brother Brenham said it that you have to be careful then you have to check whether the thing is thus sayith the Lord hallelujah Glory Hallelujah so before you run is it God speaking or is it William brenham's Human Side speaking brother Brenham goes on I'm going to show you further he says there's many things in the spoken word That's The Human Side not the prophetic side [Applause] so when you read the scripture and the quotes you must make sure that it is thus sayeth the Lord and not brother bram's Human Side amen am that answers all the [Applause] [Music] questions now listen what he says Point number three for everything in the message that goes forth this is what you have to do what read it for me are they doing it brother Bram speak like a human being and not thus say the Lord then they want to say listen brother Brenham is a human being not everything he spoke was thus say the Lord so he says watch when I say that say of the [Applause] Lord oh my my my my my my my my [Applause] my [Applause] he goes further point 4 five it's not me it's him if it's me it will fail but if it's him it can't fail if it's William brandham that said it and not thus sayth the Lord it will fail so now you got two streams to watch as you read the spoken word is it thus say the Lord or is it brother brandham [Applause] [Music] saying can I have a witness [Applause] [Music] [Applause] here now let's go to the next one listen to what he says and I can't say it until he tells me I could be altogether wrong in my thought about Martin Luther King and he was wrong because it was not thus sayeth the Lord how you going to rock edar Osco I have Bible and word Hallelujah I am not an ordinary Minister I am [Music] [Applause] special Point number six this is me speaking it's my opinion so I was wrong that was just the human side and not the thus sayeth the Lord that's why it didn't come to pass I want to ask you elter vano can you see where I'm going to [Applause] when he speaks it's thus sayth the Lord now I have dissected the quote from bully Paul I was in this meeting will he play the clip reach back a new shock of hair said just once more I believe that's the hour that we're living I believe that with all of us I believe that God making his final move going home if you want a little s to look at you need a little sign look at this old man he said I won't be an old sharks will be swimming where you're standing get close you seated now I want you to be honest with edar Rosco did he say th say of the Lord it says thus say the Lord bully you will not be an old man so n it is not th sayth the Lord it is brother bram's opinion in a private interview with his son it is not in the spoken word nowhere because the spoken word is for the bride so that was not for us that was for Billy Paul Point number [Applause] two point number three he spoke many of things to Brothers personally he told Brother R you'll be a preacher that's not in a spoken word and Ashley Campbell told Brother brand brother buly I was there he did tell you that but he never say you're fful Minister and bang Dev R gos he told bcll some things about a woman that Bisal told me personal you won't find it in the spook word he told home how many things about Bishop Johnson and what have you personal it's not in the spoken word so it's got nothing to do with a [Applause] bride so that is in two parts there it's in two parts the one part was human speaking to Billy Paul and not thus say the Lord the other part of the Sharks will swim is thus sayth the Lord that's going to [Applause] happen now why is it thus say the Lord is because of Los Angeles choosing of a bride am when brother brandham came to the pit Ed Hunter told me he said brother Rosco it was bad you know when brother Brown spoke about that cow how she looks and that's how some woman looks he said don't marry a woman like that that's got that cow look he says and the Pentecost was laughing and joking he says all of a sudden the atmosphere switched and it was like angel's wings coming into the church and then brother brandham got up he said thus sayeth the Lord Los Angeles Los Angeles one day you'll find yourself beneath the ocean that's thus sayth the Lord the Shark part is thus sayith the Lord but the Bully part is not thus sayith the Lord it is also not on the tapes it is also not in the [Applause] books are you clear on it so why was we worry we worry about that say of the [Applause] Lord and you know how this happened brother BR and prophesied and said thus say the Lord sister shakarian demon sharan's sister you shall die and in the same meeting a guy got up and spoke in tongues well Paul said he had Go's flesh and he was worried and the interpretation was my daughter you won't die you will love and Bully was worried brother Benham looked at him and said buly what's wrong said no nothing there he said no no no you you worried about the tongues he says yes yes Dad that was really nail biting Goose flesh stuff you could feel it brother said to him buly all did I say the same angel that told me sharks will swarm told me she's going to die then he added his own opinion he says you might not even get an old man so that was not thus sayith the Lord the Sharks was thus sayith the Lord and then two weeks after that Deus zakarian's sister died so if she died Los Angel because it's the same angel that says she's going to die said Los Angeles is going to sink it's going to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sink now can you see what God does to throw people off he makes brother Brenham say give his opinion and not thus sayth the Lord but we have a quote where brother Bram says you better listen to thus sayeth the Lord am I don't like this amen yet there's a little doubt in this [Applause] same no the cracking thing is when did Bully die what is October is October the 70th Jubilee we're going into the last part of the 70th Jubilee what's the 70th of 70th Jubilee it's Los Angeles going down because there must be an earthquake to open the graves and brother Bram takes Bly Paul and hook it up with a 70th Jubilee and he died in the time of the 70th [Applause] Jubilee [Applause] what is Jubilee going home going into eternity right am I right how old was bully what is eight [Applause] City come on man come on [Applause] amen we're going home in the midnight tree don't you want to go with me God is telling you it's time for Los Angeles to go down that's why I connected Billy's name with Los Angeles IST and how do you know the scientist says in 5 minutes or in 5 years those angels must be below the [Applause] sea Amen brother [Applause] Joel now how can I leave the message when I have the the answer to this question have you got to answer now tonight can't hear [Applause] you [Applause] no as it is above so it is below when Jesus was born it was above three stars came together and so it was below now what happened could we have it some of the US got the to see the Ring of eclipse Saturday October the 14th it showed in the heaven that the great man of God is going home few days after
