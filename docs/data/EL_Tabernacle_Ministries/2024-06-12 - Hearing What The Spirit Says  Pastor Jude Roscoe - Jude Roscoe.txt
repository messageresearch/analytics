Ghost comes in me I will have emotions so I act on it I hear it I recognize it and I act on it amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Applause] amen amen [Applause] amen hallu hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I have recognized you now I act on it amen the word of God that's why they say you only hear what one ear you hear mostly with one [Music] ear hallelujah hallelujah you don't hear what both ears but you mostly hear with your right ear Hallelujah that's why the Bible wasn't wrong when God says give me your ears not your ears your ear he doesn't want your left ear but he wants your right ear Hallelujah even so we can hear what po ears our brains more efficient efficiently process speech heard with the right ear because those signals arrive more quickly in a children younger than 11 the right ear Advantage is the most noticeable hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so I want to hear what my right here Lord I give you my [Applause] ear because we come to you as a child Hallelujah you got to become a child so that you can have the right ear and hear the word of God [Applause] Amen [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah I've heard that I'm one of them you have heard it but now you act on it God says you a son and a daughter of God you have heard it but now you act on it after it's reach your ear you say I believe it Lord I believe that I'm one of them I believe that I'm going into the Rapture I believe that I am a son and a daughter of the most high come from God and I'm going back to [Applause] God brother Clen what's the use you have an ear but you don't have a mouth because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God [Applause] and how will you he without the preacher the Bible says how will they hear if I don't send a preacher if I don't send a mouthpiece how will the year how will y Tabernacle year if there is no mouth to speak it amen [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without the preacher so you got a hear when there's a preacher if there's no pracher you can't hear so you can't have Revelations 108 out the [Applause] preacher and the Seven Thunders will give you Rapture in faith and what is Rapture in faith it's the oil it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you can't have Rapture in faith without the mouthpiece [Applause] [Music] oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah you can't have it you can't have it without the preacher you got to have a preacher amen hallelujah not all the preacher you can't have it but we got a preacher and we can hear it we can feel it we can love it we can be prepared for it to have Rapture in faith and what is Rapture in faith uh it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost H Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh Hallelujah I have raptured in FA hallu hall hallelujah he says when the eyes were open as the musicians comes up amen hallelujah we laugh at the preacher sometimes a good gospel preacher because he disagrees with our theology we make fun of him sometimes and even calls him that scandalous name of Holy Roller fanatic you don't know you might be talking about God when you do that oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so this man is very close to God when you say he's a Holy Roller he's a fanatic you might be speaking about God it's God in the preacher it's God in the Apostle it's God in you it's God in Me [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah hallall Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah h hallu amen just another one questions and answers on Hebrews Hallelujah 63 632 so you won't hear from nothing but you'll hear from a preacher Hallelujah and watch which has the greatest Authority an angel from heaven or an angel at the pulpit which has the greatest Authority that's why Paul says if an angel comes from Heaven Hallelujah and he doesn't say what I say let him he be a curse amen because the man in the pit though Michael is around the throne and Gabriel and Uriel the one in the pit has more Authority [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen the angel in the pit the angel in the poopet the angel in the poopet has more Authority amen s an angel up [Applause] there amen amen Apostle amen Apostle [Applause] amen that's why I can understand now when the apostles says that Mighty Angel when he dropped down he had to drop down into 26 elements because down here he doesn't have authority but in 60 26 elements he has [Applause] Authority a angel can't speak to you God needs a man a man with the mouth so that you can have an ear and hear what the mouth what the angel in the poop says to you and if the angel in the poop says you more than an overcomer then you more than of Overcomer because he's got Authority when he speaks Heaven stands at attention and says you better go answer my servant he's got more Authority than any angel in heaven then the answer must come uh then healing must come uh then Deliverance must come when the angel in the pulet speak then something must happen then the Holy Ghost will fall then something will happen to you and something will happen to me when he speaks something [Applause] happens amen [Applause] amen William Brenham can't speak anymore he's an angel in the Oran form but God will have somebody in the pit an angel behind the pit that has more Authority Hallelujah it means if he has more Authority than an angel in heaven it means he speaks before that angel when he speaks that angel must obey [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Music] Hallelujah Paul says if any angel from heaven comes and preach any other gospel to you than this which I've already preached let him be be a curse so the angel Anointed with the Holy Spirit and with the word stands next to God oh Hallelujah he's right in the throne amen he stands next to God Anointed with the Holy Ghost and Fire oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah do you believe y Tabernacle that the angel in the poopet has more Authority than an angel of Heaven do you believe El Tabernacle the angel in the poopit do you
