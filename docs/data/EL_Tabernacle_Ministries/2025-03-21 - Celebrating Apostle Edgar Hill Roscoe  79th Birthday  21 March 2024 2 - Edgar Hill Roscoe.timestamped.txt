[0:00] I believe we are in the wrong
[0:04] fight and I cannot believe what I
[0:08] [Music]
[0:10] was. I went to his house but the Holy
[0:14] Ghost is gone. I came to his house and
[0:17] Holy Ghost is gone.
[0:21] But I tried to leave something behind
[0:24] us.
[0:25] [Music]
[0:28] Now there is a beast that's taken my
[0:33] brain. You can put me to bed, but you
[0:37] can't feel my pain. You could put me to
[0:39] bed, but you can't bear my pain. Leaving
[0:42] the soul from the
[0:46] I'm just trying. I'm trying to leave
[0:48] something
[0:50] behind in the footprints of Jesus God.
[0:56] [Music]
[0:58] is free but the
[1:00] [Music]
[1:02] holy cost more than our
[1:06] [Music]
[1:07] bra come by
[1:12] simply it's so hard to
[1:18] read the future ahead it's
[1:24] already and it's time to leave hunting
[1:28] behind in the footprints of Jesus
[1:33] [Music]
[1:34] King. Now I've got this feeling that I'm
[1:38] still at the
[1:40] shore and my pockets don't know what it
[1:44] means to be
[1:46] poor. I can get through the wall if you
[1:50] give me a
[1:52] door. All the doors is closed. It's time
[1:55] to leave something
[1:57] behind in the footprints of Jesus
[2:03] King. Oh, wisdom is lost in the trees
[2:09] somewhere and you're not going to find
[2:12] it. It's a mental
[2:15] [Music]
[2:16] break. It's locked up from those who
[2:19] hurry
[2:22] ahead. It's time to leave something
[2:26] behind the foot of Jesus
[2:30] [Applause]
[2:32] God. All the
[2:38] money and the ceiling is hard
[2:42] [Music]
[2:44] to when my son stands as a statue of
[2:49] God.
[2:54] He will know what I
[2:59] [Music]
[3:02] meant. Try to leave something
[3:07] behind. I was trying to leave something
[3:13] behind. I was trying to leave
[3:17] something behind.
[3:20] [Music]
[3:25] [Applause]
[3:29] [Music]
[3:34] [Applause]
[3:36] [Music]
[3:42] [Applause]
[3:45] [Music]
[3:48] I'd
[3:49] Like I'd like to take a
[3:53] scripture out
[3:55] of St. John
[3:59] 1. It's 46, 47, and
[4:07] 48. And Nathaniel said unto
[4:11] him, "Can there any good thing come out
[4:14] of the El Tabernacle?
[4:22] Philip saith unto him,
[4:25] "Come and
[4:27] see if something good is in Al
[4:29] Teabernc."
[4:30] [Applause]
[4:37] Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him. Yes.
[4:42] Amen. and sayith unto him,
[4:47] "Behold, an Israelite
[4:50] indeed in whom is no G."
[4:54] [Music]
[4:57] Then Nathaniel saith unto
[4:59] him,
[5:01] Whence knoweth thou me?
[5:05] Jesus answered and said unto
[5:07] him, "Before that film called
[5:12] thee, when thou was under the fig tree,
[5:18] I saw thee."
[5:25] Amen.
[5:27] Let us
[5:29] pray. Father, we thank you for the
[5:31] reading of your word.
[5:37] May our past catch up with our future
[5:41] [Music]
[5:44] as Nathaniel's
[5:46] past caught up in his future.
[5:51] [Music]
[5:52] I do pray that you'd undertake for us.
[5:57] Lord, on my birthday, I
[6:00] wanted church.
[6:07] and you gave it to me.
[6:11] What a boom day present.
[6:19] Church. Thank you that I could be in
[6:23] church with
[6:26] people that was there.
[6:33] with
[6:35] me in the confidence
[6:48] to
[6:50] celebrate the
[6:52] gift that you gave Lord.
[6:56] What a gift.
[7:01] Pray that you'd undertake for us
[7:05] in Jesus' name. Amen.
[7:11] Amen.
[7:16] I
[7:18] will take a title from there.
[7:23] I just want to leave something behind.
[7:26] [Applause]
[7:28] [Music]
[7:29] I just want to leave
[7:32] on this
[7:34] birthday something behind.
[7:38] Nathaniel asked him the
[7:40] question, "Since when do you know me?"
[7:46] He says, "When you were in a fig under
[7:48] the fig tree the other day,
[7:53] Now the minute you
[7:55] say I leave something behind,
[8:00] it means that you showed to the past.
[8:07] So
[8:08] Nathaniel, it might have been a couple
[8:10] of days ago in the past.
[8:14] I saw you, but now your past has caught
[8:18] up with your future.
[8:27] And I want to say El Tabernacle, your
[8:30] past
[8:32] has caught up with you
[8:37] in this future that you're living in
[8:39] tonight.
[8:45] Brother Brandham says,
[8:48] "If you weren't there in the beginning,
[8:50] in the past,
[8:52] you're never going to be there in the
[8:57] future." And that is what it
[9:00] is. I'll leave something behind.
[9:17] And brother Brandham
[9:20] took a
[9:21] song on the wings of a snow white dove
[9:26] and he add words to that song that was
[9:29] on the hip parade
[9:30] [Applause]
[9:32] and he put himself in that song.
[9:36] Though I have suffered,
[9:38] in many
[9:39] ways I cried for healing,
[9:44] he took that song
[9:50] and he pleaded on the wings of a snow
[9:52] white dove.
[9:58] Brother
[9:59] Brandham, when he got near his wife
[10:03] and they were laying on the bed, Amen.
[10:06] And he looked into our eyes
[10:08] and he wanted to serenate her.
[10:11] Amen. He wanted to have a loving
[10:14] evening. And then the prophet will take
[10:17] that song.
[10:19] You are my sunshine.
[10:22] My only
[10:24] sunshine. You make me happy
[10:27] when skies are blue. It takes a song.
[10:54] And then and then he preached a whole
[10:56] message.
[10:59] Loving he loved me.
[11:02] dying. He saved me
[11:07] a whole song. He takes that and he
[11:09] starts preaching a message on it.
[11:14] So I tonight
[11:16] want to take this song
[11:19] in all that I tried to do
[11:22] for 79 years.
[11:25] I was just trying
[11:28] to leave something behind.
[11:44] Everybody
[11:46] leaves something behind.
[11:49] Don't care who you are, bad or good,
[11:54] you leave something behind.
[12:07] Some leaves big wolves behind with a lot
[12:10] of money, but they leave something
[12:13] behind.
[12:15] Others leaves a lot of credit behind,
[12:18] but you leave something
[12:24] behind. Others leave
[12:27] legacies, great legacies,
[12:31] but you leave something
[12:36] behind. Others
[12:40] leaves
[12:43] disappointments and that too you leave
[12:49] [Applause]
[12:51] behind. The thing you leave
[12:54] behind become a memory.
[12:58] People remembers.
[13:01] Look at every funeral you attend. They
[13:03] will come and says, "Well, he did this
[13:05] and this and this." What they left
[13:09] something
[13:10] behind.
[13:12] Memories gets left behind.
[13:15] And from
[13:16] memories it become history.
[13:23] And history makes memorials
[13:27] [Applause]
[13:29] because you just left something behind.
[13:41] The great guys of yesterday year left
[13:45] something behind.
[13:46] [Applause]
[13:48] They always leave something behind,
[13:54] something that people could remember
[13:56] them by. Jenkins Khn left something
[14:01] behind. Alexander the Great left
[14:05] something behind. Napoleon Bonapart left
[14:09] something behind. Hitler left something
[14:13] behind. Pelle left something
[14:17] behind. Jack Nicholas with a golf left
[14:21] something behind. You can be a great
[14:24] guy, you're going to leave something
[14:26] behind. You can be a nobody
[14:31] and
[14:32] yet you're going to
[14:35] leave something behind.
[14:53] soul.
[14:55] William Brennham. Yes. Amen. When he
[14:59] cried out,
[15:01] I'm going to leave this Bible for
[15:03] Joseph.
[15:05] Brother Brennan left something
[15:08] behind.
[15:17] Brother
[15:18] Brennham when he took the cloud and he
[15:21] turned the cloud
[15:24] and he said this will go down in
[15:27] history what did he do? He left
[15:30] something behind.
[15:36] Amen. Amen.
[15:40] The pillar of fire that was at the back
[15:42] of his head. Amen. That's hanging all
[15:46] over where you went and
[15:48] go. What was that? He left something
[15:57] behind. All the mysteries of the entire
[16:01] Bible, every nuke, every corner in the
[16:04] Bible,
[16:06] he revealed it.
[16:08] What did he do?
[16:11] He put it on tape because he wanted to
[16:14] leave something behind.
[16:32] Jesus, King God.
[16:35] [Music]
[16:36] When he says, "I have to go to my
[16:38] father, but I'll send you a comforter."
[16:43] He left something behind.
[17:15] He said, he said, "I must go so that he
[17:20] can come because I'm leaving him behind
[17:25] to lead you into all truth."
[17:29] Yes, he left something behind.
[17:46] Jesus, King God.
[17:49] [Music]
[17:51] When he took his final step
[17:56] and he looked back, he saw footprints
[18:01] on the sands of
[18:03] time that's
[18:05] leading to the promised land. What did
[18:08] he do? I can't hear you. What did he do?
[18:15] He left footprints behind. He left
[18:18] something behind. He left something for
[18:21] you to follow. He left something for you
[18:24] to to be
[18:27] guided because he left something behind.
[18:36] [Music]
[18:38] Oh my
[18:39] [Applause]
[18:44] Paul left something behind.
[18:47] So if anybody comes and says seven
[18:51] thunders and seven virtues let him be a
[18:53] curse
[18:56] because even if it's an angel because I
[19:00] left something behind.
[19:16] [Applause]
[19:20] And then I came
[19:21] [Music]
[19:23] to this place.
[19:27] I went before the beginning.
[19:31] I went
[19:33] in the beginning
[19:36] and I end from the beginning.
[19:48] [Applause]
[20:22] [Music]
[20:23] Woo!
[20:28] Hallelujah.
[20:39] [Applause]
[21:04] Heat. Heat.
[21:29] [Applause]
[21:32] Yes.
[21:33] Yes. Yes.
[21:37] I went before the beginning
[21:40] and I came out to a place
[21:44] before the beginning
[21:46] at the great conference of
[21:48] God. And there we were sitting.
[21:53] Amen. In the great conference of
[21:57] God. And here God saw the deceitfulness
[22:00] of Satan before Satan was actually
[22:04] created.
[22:07] God save our souls
[22:09] already. Took the lamb and slay the
[22:19] lamb. I just wanted to leave. I just
[22:23] wanted to
[22:24] leave. I just wanted to leave something
[22:28] behind.
[22:40] [Music]
[22:43] And I
[22:44] look 3.5 billion years ago
[22:49] and God formed the earth 3.5 billion
[22:53] years ago.
[22:55] And as he forms the earth, the ones
[22:58] names that was in the lamb's book of
[23:00] life, they were there already. And they
[23:03] looked at him creating the earth. And
[23:06] the Bible says in the book of
[23:08] Job, where were you when the sons of God
[23:13] shouted for joy when he laid the
[23:17] foundation, I just want to
[23:20] leave something behind.
[24:02] I don't think Lucifer wanted to hear
[24:04] that
[24:09] one. And the sons of God was shouting
[24:13] for joy.
[24:17] And right now, tonight, God's got
[24:20] another man that makes the sons and the
[24:23] daughters of God shout for
[24:29] joy for a new creation.
[24:42] I just
[24:44] wanted to
[24:47] leave something
[24:51] behind. And
[24:53] while while we were
[24:56] shouting, while we were
[24:59] screaming, while we were drunk in the
[25:04] spirit, Lucifer didn't like it.
[25:09] and it caused trouble
[25:11] in
[25:12] heaven. And God says, "Any man that
[25:15] makes trouble in my church, I kick him
[25:22] out." And I saw
[25:25] Lucifer fall
[25:32] down. How have I fallen on Lucifer?
[25:50] And we're kicking him out here tonight
[25:53] because the sons of God is here
[26:01] tonight. Heat. Heat.
[26:23] Thank you.
[26:35] Yeah.
[26:49] [Applause]
[26:56] When I preached that, hallelujah. When I
[26:59] preach that,
[27:02] what did you do, brother Rosco?
[27:05] I just wanted to leave something
[27:15] behind and God made in Eden and I see
[27:19] him drop down in Eden.
[27:24] Lucifer
[27:26] in the body
[27:29] of the serpent
[27:34] a handsome man.
[27:36] The Bible call him a cherubam.
[27:40] Which cherubam?
[27:42] The man cheruban.
[27:46] The one with the face of a man.
[27:55] He was thrown
[27:57] out. Amen. Into the Garden of Eden.
[28:01] And I look at this cherubam.
[28:04] Amen.
[28:06] A man, a serpent.
[28:10] And then I
[28:11] saw
[28:13] what that serpent could do.
[28:17] The weakness of a man.
[28:21] That's
[28:22] why God had to destroy him because Eve
[28:28] would have ran after him all the time
[28:33] and God slayed him.
[28:37] Then I saw evolution
[28:42] coming right up to the serpent.
[28:45] Lord, I saw the chimpanzee.
[28:50] I saw the H Highleberg man. I saw the
[28:53] Nebraska man. I saw the Bolton down man.
[28:59] I saw the peeking man. I saw the neon
[29:03] grateral man. I see the cro-Magnum man.
[29:07] And then I see the serpent man. And then
[29:11] I see the modern man. Amen. Adam. But
[29:15] also then I saw the real man, the only
[29:20] man, the son of
[29:25] man. I just wanted to leave something
[29:28] behind.
[29:41] And I hear a prophet says there'll come
[29:44] a man one time and he'll preach
[29:47] evolution and nobody in the message
[29:50] preach
[29:52] evolution, but he send a boy that is a
[29:56] man.
[30:04] Now I just wanted to
[30:06] [Music]
[30:09] leave something behind.
[30:21] And finally the man came.
[30:25] When he came
[30:27] He was full of blood,
[30:30] thorns on his head. And he stood in
[30:34] front of Pilate. And Pilate looked at
[30:37] him and he looked at this
[30:40] congressman and he says,
[30:43] "Behold the
[30:45] man, the only man
[31:03] I just wanted
[31:04] to leave something behind.
[31:08] [Applause]
[31:21] Brother Brennham
[31:25] was compelled to come to South Africa
[31:27] 1951.
[31:30] There was a reason why he came
[31:35] because there was a little boy
[31:41] [Applause]
[31:53] And that little
[31:54] boy has become a
[31:58] man. And now he just want to leave
[32:02] something
[32:03] behind. That the prophet laid
[32:06] hands on this head. I just wanted to
[32:11] leave something
[32:13] [Music]
[32:14] behind. Sitting in my
[32:17] study, here come a letter from Billy
[32:19] Paul. And in the letter, Billy Paul
[32:23] says, "Edgar Roscoll,
[32:26] I only listen to my father and you
[32:30] because you got a very fine spirit.
[32:34] I just wanted to leave something behind.
[32:39] From brother Brandham to Billy Paul,
[32:42] from Billy Paul to brother Higginson,
[32:46] the head deacon of Brennham
[32:49] tabernacle and he came into the
[32:53] sanctuary and he felt the
[32:56] anointing and he said the anointing
[32:58] that's here was the same
[33:01] anointing when brother Brandham preached
[33:04] the
[33:05] same the scripture. is fulfilled and
[33:10] this
[33:11] day the scripture is
[33:14] fulfilled. I just wanted to leave
[33:17] something
[33:28] behind from brother Brandham to Billy
[33:32] Paul
[33:34] to the head deacon of Brandham
[33:35] Tabernacle.
[33:37] knows that something
[33:41] has been left behind.
[33:43] El tabernacle,
[33:46] even
[33:48] Jeffersonville had to acknowledge
[33:50] there's going to come somebody that's
[33:53] going to leave something behind.
[34:00] I can't help who I am
[34:04] because I was
[34:06] chosen to leave something behind.
[34:24] Will brother Stephford come up please?
[34:29] Brother
[34:35] [Music]
[34:42] Steph and this
[34:45] cherubam was walking
[34:49] in the garden of Eden.
[34:55] That's why
[34:57] When we hear we devil chasing. Amen. You
[35:01] sisters that don't respect your husband,
[35:03] we one of these days are going to put
[35:05] you out of the church.
[35:07] Your husbands that don't love your
[35:10] wives, we're going to put you out of the
[35:11] church
[35:12] [Applause]
[35:15] because there is somebody
[35:18] that God said leave something behind.
[35:27] Brother Stephen, will you just give
[35:31] them the testimony
[35:34] so that we can just leave it behind.
[35:37] Thank
[35:42] you. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand
[35:44] clap. Amen.
[35:51] The apostle just wants me to share a
[35:53] short testimony with you. Amen. I was
[35:56] working in this company and in one of
[35:58] our subsidiary companies was a colored
[36:02] guy and this guy wanted an appointment
[36:05] with me and every time he comes to my
[36:08] office I wasn't
[36:09] available and then I said to my PA I
[36:12] said listen just schedule this
[36:14] appointment with this guy. tell him when
[36:16] he comes we make an appointment and I'll
[36:19] see him. So he came and he came under
[36:23] the guise of wanting career
[36:26] advice. But really I could hear when we
[36:29] started to talk. He said he knows I'm a
[36:32] Christian. He knows where I serve El
[36:36] Tabernacle. He knows my
[36:38] apostle Edgar Rosco.
[36:42] So I said to this guy, his name is
[36:44] Nathan Operman.
[36:46] So I said, "Nathan, how do you know my
[36:49] apostle?"
[36:51] He says, "Brother Stephford, let me tell
[36:52] you
[36:53] something." He says, "My father is like
[36:56] a bishop in the AFM church."
[37:00] And around the late 70s, I think around
[37:04] 1977, Kenneth Hagen came to South Africa
[37:09] and he had an audience with Kenneth
[37:11] Hagen, his father Andrew Operman.
[37:16] And this young boy Nathan, he went with
[37:19] his father and he was sitting there when
[37:23] Kenneth Hagen spoke to his father. And
[37:26] Kenneth Hagen said to his father, that
[37:29] was around 1977 when he came to South
[37:32] Africa. He said, "You need to associate
[37:38] yourself with a man by the name of Edgar
[37:42] Rosco.
[37:49] He said that
[37:50] man carries the power of God.
[38:02] And you know as we were talking it only
[38:04] became clear to me. So I told him about
[38:06] the church and all that but it only the
[38:09] puzzle came together only later when his
[38:13] father put in his will that when he dies
[38:18] the apostle must bury him.
[38:23] [Applause]
[38:31] So, this was something phenomenal to me
[38:33] and we wanted to get it on tape
[38:36] and we spoke to him and he said, "No,
[38:40] we'll do it. It'll come on tape." But by
[38:42] the time we wanted to finalize it, he
[38:46] had stage four
[38:48] cancer and within 4 days after speaking
[38:51] to me, he passed away.
[38:54] But his father was buried by the apostle
[38:59] and we all know the rest is history what
[39:02] happened at that service. So to the man
[39:04] of God we salute you and we want to say
[39:08] happy birthday pastor. You definitely
[39:10] left something
[39:12] behind. God bless you. Thank
[39:15] you. Thank you.
[39:21] Now that's the same man
[39:26] that Sol Ranica and them was under
[39:29] that was his
[39:32] mentor. Every
[39:34] Tuesday they had studies with Andrew
[39:38] Oppaman and Andrew Oppaman's got a
[39:41] better chance than Solar Renica.
[39:43] Exactly.
[39:51] And I do not know Kenneth Copelan and
[39:54] all those guys, but you know, God
[39:59] does things like this
[40:01] just to leave something behind.
[40:22] What fruit
[40:25] is
[40:26] on the
[40:31] tree? One of the
[40:33] elders said to John
[40:37] the bride,
[40:39] hallelujah,
[40:41] part in El Tabernacle.
[40:44] told you, "Weep not.
[40:49] You're safe.
[40:54] Weep not,
[40:58] John. You're
[41:01] safe. Just follow the
[41:04] footsteps that's left behind.
[41:14] And I asked the Holy
[41:16] Ghost, who is that
[41:20] elder? And nobody ever mentioned it. And
[41:24] it came down that elder is none else
[41:27] than Paul because Paul was in the third
[41:30] heaven and Paul saw the lamb there that
[41:34] takes away the sons of the world and he
[41:38] cried
[41:38] out, "Don't cry.
[41:43] The line of the tribe of
[41:49] Judah has
[41:52] prevailed. And I came and told
[41:55] you now I leave something
[42:06] behind. Oh
[42:09] my. And that anointed cherubam.
[42:12] It reminds me of the two cherubams
[42:15] that's on the ark.
[42:17] On the one side, the face of a man and
[42:21] on the other
[42:23] side, the face of a lion. Now, you never
[42:27] heard this in a message. They know
[42:29] nothing.
[42:34] Who's that? Two
[42:35] cherubams. Face of a man and a face of a
[42:39] lion. couldn't have been anybody
[42:42] else because the lion of the tribe of
[42:45] Judah has become a
[42:47] man and he poured out his blood on the
[42:51] mercy seat. Hallelujah. I'm just leaving
[42:56] something
[43:06] behind. That was not good enough.
[43:28] I just want to young people. I just want
[43:31] to I just want to leave something
[43:35] behind.
[43:38] Thank you.
[43:54] I was laying in my
[43:56] bed in Jerusalem.
[44:00] Oh Jerusalem,
[44:02] Jerusalem, how beautiful is your
[44:04] mountains.
[44:07] And when David saw it, he says, "I lift
[44:12] up my eyes towards
[44:15] the mountains
[44:17] where from my strength come."
[44:21] I was lying in between the
[44:23] mountains of
[44:27] Jerusalem and he came down and he told
[44:29] me, "You're not going outside seeing
[44:32] today."
[44:35] I said, "Lord,
[44:37] why can't I go out today?" Said, "You s
[44:42] and you read
[44:44] Revelations 10."
[44:47] I said, "But I I know Revelations 10.
[44:50] It's my bread and my butter, Lord." He
[44:53] said, "You stay
[44:55] behind in
[44:59] Jerusalem." I went down. And I said,
[45:02] "Lovey, I can't go out. I can't go
[45:06] sightseeing.
[45:08] I can't go out with you. I must stay."
[45:11] He told me to read a Revelation 10.
[45:16] And they left and I was in the room
[45:19] alone between the mountains that David
[45:22] saw.
[45:24] And shortly here round about 11:00 I
[45:27] think my strength came from the
[45:30] mountains.
[45:32] And as I
[45:34] read Revelations 10, I saw that the
[45:39] Bible says, "And when the seven thunders
[45:44] uttered there," he says,
[45:48] "Stop there." You said that's that's a
[45:52] word that you couldn't spell. When you
[45:54] spell there, you spell it t h e r e. But
[45:59] this is t h e i r. This is human beings.
[46:05] And if the seven thunders are there is
[46:08] seven human beings. And what is utter?
[46:11] Utter means speech. What is utter means
[46:14] preaching. He says the seven thundersu
[46:17] is the seven messengers of the seven
[46:20] church ages and the revelation came down
[46:23] where my strength come. Hallelujah. I
[46:26] just want to
[46:29] leave something behind.
[46:37] [Music]
[46:42] Oh my
[46:44] [Music]
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:51] And then
[46:52] [Applause]
[46:54] to 20
[46:57] 24, he
[46:59] said, pick up Revelations 10 again
[47:04] and read it through.
[47:07] I must still come back and preach the
[47:11] entire Bible
[47:14] folded in Revelations 10. It might it
[47:19] might be the whole year. I don't know.
[47:24] And I started to read it verse by verse.
[47:28] And I came to Revelations
[47:31] 10:8. And I saw Brother Bram says,
[47:33] "That's the bride." He said, "But now
[47:35] watch now.
[47:37] It's the bride.
[47:40] But the sisters is in the bride, too.
[47:44] But they don't prophesy.
[47:47] It's only men that prophesy.
[47:50] So it must be in the five-fold ministry
[47:53] that prophesy."
[47:55] And I he said to me, "Now, who in the
[47:57] five-fold ministry is prophesying
[47:59] again?"
[48:00] And I wasn't ashamed to tell him Edgar
[48:04] Rosco Revelations
[48:07] 10:8.
[48:12] Hallelujah. I just want to leave
[48:16] something behind.
[48:40] [Music]
[48:41] [Applause]
[48:46] And then he gave me Revelations 22 to
[48:48] hook up with Revelations 10:8. Amen.
[48:52] John, see that you don't seal up the
[48:54] prophecy.
[48:56] Now, how could he not seal up the
[48:58] prophecy if he's not going to prophesy
[49:01] again? The only way to keep it open,
[49:04] preach on it for a whole
[49:11] year. I just wanted
[49:14] to leave something behind.
[49:21] [Music]
[49:22] Then I went around the world in a
[49:25] message and all that I heard the word.
[49:30] The word the word the word
[49:35] spokes quotes the word. And I said,
[49:39] "Lord, there's something wrong here."
[49:44] And then he spoke to my heart. He says,
[49:46] "Edgar,
[49:48] there's four parts to the word."
[49:50] [Applause]
[49:54] Oh,
[49:59] I said, "Lord, which four parts?"
[50:02] He says, "The written word don't save
[50:04] you." Everybody preach it.
[50:08] The spoken word don't save you. That's
[50:12] for third Paul. Squirrels.
[50:17] The revealed word don't save you. The
[50:19] minute he says flesh and blood didn't
[50:21] reveal it to you, Peter, the next verse
[50:23] says God told him, "Get behind me,
[50:25] Satan.
[50:27] That don't save
[50:29] you." But what saves you? The living
[50:34] manifested word is the only thing that
[50:38] saves you.
[50:42] I just wanted to
[50:45] leave something behind.
[50:57] [Music]
[50:58] Amen.
[51:06] The loving word
[51:08] saves you. Why? Amen.
[51:12] Then he opens the Bible for me.
[51:16] He says, "Some seeds
[51:19] fall
[51:22] on rocky places.
[51:24] That don't save you.
[51:27] Other
[51:28] seeds fall in
[51:31] between thorns and it gets choked. That
[51:35] don't save you.
[51:39] other word word word falls
[51:44] on dry places
[51:47] that don't save you.
[51:49] So it's not word
[51:52] word but the word that falls on good
[51:56] ground that saves you.
[52:00] Four parts to the word of God.
[52:06] I just want to leave something behind.
[52:21] And then another thing that made me sick
[52:26] is whenever
[52:29] I go, brother, you got to love, man.
[52:33] You got to love, brother.
[52:36] You know, Brother Rosco's got no love.
[52:39] You know, there's no love.
[52:42] Nothing.
[52:44] Amen.
[52:46] And then I walked up and I found
[52:50] in the message
[52:52] rejected King.
[52:55] Brother Brandham says the Holy Ghost
[52:59] is love.
[53:01] [Music]
[53:02] [Applause]
[53:07] Then I found
[53:10] out that the book of Galatians
[53:13] says love is only a fruit of the spirit.
[53:19] Not the spirit is the fruit of love.
[53:22] Love comes out of the baptism of the
[53:25] Holy Ghost. Cannot be any other way.
[53:31] only a
[53:32] fruit. Only a
[53:35] fruit. Then I read Romans
[53:39] 5:5. Could you read it with me? Romans
[53:42] 5:5.
[53:49] How does the love come into your heart?
[53:53] So without the Holy Ghost, no love.
[54:05] [Music]
[54:07] There is seven steps of love. Which love
[54:10] are you talking about?
[54:13] Amen. My Lord. Amen. And amen. Lord.
[54:18] Hey.
[54:20] Then he
[54:21] sings on the wings of the
[54:24] snow. White.
[54:27] What is the white dove?
[54:30] He says, "And love is on the wings of a
[54:32] dove to the wings of the Holy
[54:37] Ghost." Oh,
[54:45] and then I read in the Bible,
[54:50] there's only a time to love.
[54:53] You can't laugh all the time. When are
[54:56] you going to get a re a time to rebuke?
[54:59] When are you going to get a time to
[55:02] hate sin? And there's only a
[55:06] time to laugh. But you want to laugh all
[55:10] the time. When Jesus knocked them out of
[55:14] the temple, where was love?
[55:17] [Applause]
[55:20] Hey, I just wanted to leave something
[55:24] behind.
[55:40] I just wanted to leave something behind.
[55:43] [Applause]
[55:49] [Music]
[55:49] [Applause]
[55:59] The
[56:01] 1979 I walk into the
[56:04] classroom still under the umbrella
[56:08] of the teeth
[56:10] the Holy Ghost without emotions.
[56:15] And when I went in there
[56:19] and preached for 10 minutes
[56:23] chairs went through the window,
[56:26] sisters got slain. The hallelujah and
[56:29] the glory to God was like they shouted
[56:32] for joy. And the Holy Ghost fell from 79
[56:38] until now. And it never stop. And it
[56:42] won't stop. I won't let it stop because
[56:47] I'm leaving something
[56:54] behind. Enjoy the Holy
[56:57] Ghost. Enjoy the Holy
[57:08] Ghost.
[57:18] Hallelujah.
[57:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[58:01] [Music]
[58:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[58:31] [Music]
[58:33] Oh my.
[58:39] Can I have another few moments?
[58:45] that I heard the other day.
[58:48] They said the initial evidence is
[58:51] when the word of God
[58:54] says, "Have you received the Holy Ghost
[58:57] since you believe?"
[59:00] And then they turn around believe what
[59:02] the message for your day. They said,
[59:05] "That's the evidence." Now,
[59:08] the Holy Ghost told me that's right.
[59:11] Did you believe
[59:15] the word for your day
[59:18] since you received the Holy Ghost. They
[59:20] say that's it. But my problem is
[59:24] is dancing in the word, is shouting in
[59:28] the word, is being drunk in the word.
[59:32] Then why don't you believe it and do it?
[59:36] You're a liar.
[59:40] Faith without works is dead.
[59:55] I just wanted to
[59:57] leave something
[1:00:01] behind.
[1:00:07] Listen, then Phil thief came when the
[1:00:11] Holy Ghost poured out in Al tabernacle
[1:00:13] and he came and he said the Holy Ghost
[1:00:16] with no emotions. Now there is no quote
[1:00:19] for that
[1:00:22] but put that back in the Bible.
[1:00:27] Where are they going to put it?
[1:00:32] I know where it is.
[1:00:34] And I told you where it is.
[1:00:37] Acts chapter 2, there came a rushing
[1:00:40] mighty wind, the Holy Ghost. No
[1:00:47] emotions. It fell up the house. No
[1:00:51] emotions. They were sitting. No
[1:00:54] emotions.
[1:00:56] They had cloven tongues over their
[1:00:58] heads. no
[1:01:00] emotions. But after that, the Bible
[1:01:02] says, "And they received the Holy Ghost
[1:01:05] and emotions
[1:01:10] came." Oh, put it back in the
[1:01:14] Bible. I just want to I just want to I
[1:01:19] just want to leave something behind.
[1:01:36] Oh my
[1:01:48] And
[1:01:49] then I
[1:01:52] thought, brother, I thought that I'm
[1:01:55] screaming. I'm
[1:01:57] shouting. I am dancing.
[1:02:00] I'm getting drunk.
[1:02:03] I'm acting stupid.
[1:02:06] I thought it it's me. And then I picked
[1:02:08] up a quote. Brother Graham says it's not
[1:02:11] you. Is the angel of God inside of you
[1:02:16] shouting, screaming, dancing.
[1:02:24] It's not
[1:02:26] you who's screaming there. I see the
[1:02:29] angels of God.
[1:03:05] And then we came back and we took the
[1:03:09] quote to brother B says turn the cloud
[1:03:11] to your right side.
[1:03:15] turn it
[1:03:17] to the right side
[1:03:20] the cloud.
[1:03:22] And then I read he says
[1:03:25] he's got a wig on.
[1:03:29] And then I saw he say it's the judge.
[1:03:33] [Applause]
[1:03:39] 1963 it's the judge.
[1:03:54] Do you know that we already judged
[1:03:57] by the
[1:03:58] word of the prophet?
[1:04:02] So, we're not going to the white throne
[1:04:04] because the white throne is the word of
[1:04:07] God judging.
[1:04:09] But the judge already came.
[1:04:13] And I see a a prophet said, "I'm making
[1:04:17] this tabernacle a courthouse."
[1:04:21] [Applause]
[1:04:23] Hallelujah. He made his church a
[1:04:25] courthouse.
[1:04:28] And he says, "I will start
[1:04:30] preaching warning and judgment."
[1:04:36] And after he preached warning and
[1:04:37] judgment, he preached, "Now I already
[1:04:41] warned you. I indict you now."
[1:04:45] And after he preached
[1:04:47] indictment, he went around and preached
[1:04:51] trial,
[1:04:52] trial,
[1:04:54] trial, trial, trial. Five trials.
[1:05:00] And after he preached five
[1:05:02] trials, he put them in prison. Souls in
[1:05:07] prison. They in prison
[1:05:10] now can never get the Holy Ghost
[1:05:13] anymore. Why the judge is here? I just
[1:05:17] wanted to leave something
[1:05:20] behind. I save you from the
[1:05:25] prison. I pull the prison bars open.
[1:05:39] [Applause]
[1:05:44] Oh, then I
[1:05:47] preached the seven dimensions
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:05:52] and I preached Saturday is here.
[1:05:56] What happened Saturday? He went into the
[1:05:59] prison
[1:06:02] in the first dimension of
[1:06:04] hell and he preached in season and out
[1:06:07] of season. Out of season, Noah's
[1:06:11] day in his season, his day and they
[1:06:14] didn't repent.
[1:06:21] And after he
[1:06:23] preached, nobody got saved. It was the
[1:06:27] third pool.
[1:06:30] And then he went down to the third
[1:06:31] dimension of hell.
[1:06:34] And he rearranged Satan.
[1:06:38] Even his own devils didn't recognize
[1:06:40] him. He set captivity
[1:06:43] captive. He triumphed over the
[1:06:48] devil. He kicked the
[1:06:51] devil back into hell again.
[1:07:00] Saturday is here.
[1:07:05] Then that same
[1:07:09] Saturday, the
[1:07:12] blessed the saints
[1:07:15] under the sixth dimension.
[1:07:18] And it wasn't sixth dimension. It was
[1:07:20] paradise.
[1:07:22] heard him
[1:07:24] calking and talking
[1:07:26] to the thief that was on the cross next
[1:07:29] to him. And he told the thief, "Don't
[1:07:33] worry. Watch these doors
[1:07:36] open." And he came to the doors. He
[1:07:39] said, "Open up your
[1:07:41] [Applause]
[1:07:42] doors." And the angel says, "Who are
[1:07:46] you?" He says, "I'm the
[1:07:48] Lord mighty in battle.
[1:07:52] I conquered
[1:07:54] hell. I conquered
[1:07:56] death. And I conquered the grave.
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:25] Oh my.
[1:08:38] So, I'm nearly there.
[1:08:53] My brother, my sister,
[1:08:58] you can't put me to bed.
[1:09:03] You can't put me to bed.
[1:09:07] Because you can't feel my pain.
[1:09:11] You can put me to bed,
[1:09:13] but you'll never know my pain.
[1:09:18] Pain for 59 years in a message. All the
[1:09:22] different talks against me. Blessed is
[1:09:25] the man that when they speak all men of
[1:09:28] evil against him for my name's sake.
[1:09:33] You do not know my pain.
[1:09:36] You can put me to bed, but you don't
[1:09:39] know my pain.
[1:09:46] Oh my.
[1:09:58] I'm nearly closing.
[1:10:04] I can't get through the
[1:10:06] wall of these churches in the message.
[1:10:10] That's right. It's true. Hallelujah.
[1:10:12] Unless
[1:10:14] they open the door.
[1:10:17] But all the doors are closed.
[1:10:21] And they got the Holy Ghost outside.
[1:10:24] I can't get through their walls
[1:10:27] unless they open the door.
[1:10:33] Paul said, "All have forsaken me."
[1:10:36] Brother Bram says, "I'm alone."
[1:10:39] When you're a man of God,
[1:10:42] you are alone.
[1:10:49] Money is free.
[1:10:53] Everybody can
[1:10:55] get a
[1:10:58] dollar right up to a billion dollars.
[1:11:02] Money is
[1:11:07] free. But the Holy Ghost cost more than
[1:11:11] your natural bread.
[1:11:16] Simon the sorcerer wanted to buy the
[1:11:19] Holy Ghost. He didn't have enough money.
[1:11:23] Money is free, but the Holy Ghost costs
[1:11:27] more. Money is
[1:11:30] free, and the Holy Ghost is too far up
[1:11:33] the ceiling to reach.
[1:11:38] [Applause]
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:41] Oh, the future
[1:11:44] head is already dead.
[1:11:49] Lord, it's already dead.
[1:11:53] because he's painted to a thread.
[1:11:56] The Pope is on his dying days.
[1:12:00] Trump is running wild around the world.
[1:12:05] Money is getting scarce.
[1:12:12] I'm trying to leave something behind
[1:12:15] in the footprints
[1:12:18] of Jesus, King God. I'm trying to leave
[1:12:22] it behind.
[1:12:33] So you can
[1:12:36] go leave and say goodbye.
[1:12:40] But here I'll stay in El Tabernacle.
[1:12:45] I'm not going
[1:12:47] anywhere because I left something
[1:12:50] behind.
[1:13:00] You can lie to
[1:13:01] me with all those spoken word books that
[1:13:04] you don't love. Exactly.
[1:13:09] I can't follow you to the end of the
[1:13:12] world with all that false doctrines.
[1:13:17] Why not rightly dividing the word?
[1:13:21] Making the word of God to none effect.
[1:13:25] Mis consting the word. Misinterpreting
[1:13:30] the word. Dislocating the word. Add to
[1:13:35] the word seven thunders seven virtues
[1:13:39] add into the world subtracting from the
[1:13:42] word the Holy Ghost without emotions.
[1:13:48] I can't follow you till the end. My soul
[1:13:51] will be lost with all the spoken word
[1:13:54] books that you can't love.
[1:13:59] Amen.
[1:14:00] Amen.
[1:14:03] Oh, I'm nearing the end.
[1:14:07] Oh, I nearly forgot.
[1:14:10] I nearly forgot.
[1:14:13] I walk into the El Tabernacle church
[1:14:17] right into the
[1:14:19] sanctuary. I see a
[1:14:21] man that was blind once
[1:14:25] standing in front of the pulp. But
[1:14:29] now worshiping
[1:14:31] God. His
[1:14:35] eyes
[1:14:38] 2020. I'm just
[1:14:40] trying to leave something
[1:14:47] behind. right in the church
[1:14:53] now. Oh,
[1:14:56] I look and behold a man
[1:15:01] leaping and dancing right now in El
[1:15:03] Tabernacle.
[1:15:05] So
[1:15:06] crippled. So crippled that they had to
[1:15:10] carry him to the toilet.
[1:15:14] I see a couple
[1:15:16] man in Craig's door while we were
[1:15:20] dancing took his crutches and threw it
[1:15:22] away and started to
[1:15:24] dance. I just want to
[1:15:27] leave something
[1:15:32] behind. This couple man is right here
[1:15:38] now.
[1:15:40] Why? I just wanted to
[1:15:43] Leave
[1:15:44] something behind.
[1:15:55] I come into the church, the congregation
[1:15:59] and I witness
[1:16:01] three to five people
[1:16:03] raised from the dead.
[1:16:06] [Applause]
[1:16:30] I just wanted to leave something
[1:16:34] behind. I remember
[1:16:39] Ptoria
[1:16:41] as sister Lynette and her husband
[1:16:44] brought it back to my mind. We were
[1:16:47] having a meeting at George Martins.
[1:16:51] Knock on the door. Guy came and asked us
[1:16:54] to just please come over. His wife just
[1:16:57] died. The morttery was standing there
[1:17:00] waiting for him,
[1:17:03] for her. We went over and Raymond, you
[1:17:06] were there. Raymond Thompson, you were
[1:17:09] there.
[1:17:11] Raymond, Raymond, you were
[1:17:18] there and we went
[1:17:21] over and we form a circle around her
[1:17:26] and I prayed just a simple prayer
[1:17:30] and she was ice cold.
[1:17:34] The mortary already wrote out her debt
[1:17:37] certificate and after I prayed for her,
[1:17:40] she jumped up and said, "Give me some
[1:17:43] [Applause]
[1:17:45] water. I just want to
[1:17:48] leave something
[1:17:50] [Applause]
[1:18:00] [Music]
[1:18:01] behind." Amen.
[1:18:03] [Applause]
[1:18:05] I just wanted to
[1:18:08] leave something behind.
[1:18:12] Amen. I behold in El Tabernacle now
[1:18:17] [Applause]
[1:18:18] a death and a dumb woman
[1:18:22] was a teacher at the deaf and dumb
[1:18:25] school.
[1:18:26] receive a
[1:18:28] healing, loose her tongue,
[1:18:32] and stop her ears
[1:18:34] before the whole congregation.
[1:18:37] And them all
[1:18:41] fainted. And there she
[1:18:44] is still alive
[1:18:47] today, yuring and talking.
[1:19:00] I just wanted to read
[1:19:03] something behind.
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:08] Where's my other sister? That was
[1:19:11] death. Is she here?
[1:19:14] That was death.
[1:19:17] She is right in the church. Her ears is
[1:19:21] open
[1:19:22] in the church now.
[1:19:32] I was astonished in El Tabernacle
[1:19:35] now. A woman whose tubes was cut
[1:19:40] out and female parts
[1:19:44] damaged and the doctor says she will be
[1:19:47] barren all her
[1:19:50] life. Her husband's sperm bank couldn't
[1:19:53] make a half a child.
[1:19:57] God created human parts,
[1:20:01] raised sperm banks
[1:20:04] [Music]
[1:20:05] like in a third Paul manifestation
[1:20:10] and she gave birth to two
[1:20:14] children. There she
[1:20:19] is. I just wanted to
[1:20:22] leave something behind.
[1:20:28] [Music]
[1:20:31] Hallelujah.
[1:20:36] I lost count of how many women now in El
[1:20:41] Tabernacle
[1:20:43] that was barren
[1:20:46] that's having babies in their hands
[1:20:49] babies on the two
[1:20:52] sides. I even told her, you know, the
[1:20:54] whole plan wasn't given to them.
[1:20:57] Hallelujah. To multiply.
[1:21:00] Amen.
[1:21:02] Right now in El Tabernacle,
[1:21:07] wouldn't you like to be in a church like
[1:21:11] this? I just wanted to
[1:21:14] leave something behind.
[1:21:19] A elder in El
[1:21:21] Tabernacle had to have a heart
[1:21:23] transplant. You know about the
[1:21:24] testimony.
[1:21:26] He came to me. He was on his way to
[1:21:31] hospital.
[1:21:33] To have the operation on his heart.
[1:21:36] I prayed for him.
[1:21:39] When he got to
[1:21:42] the doctor says, "Let's just check you
[1:21:43] again."
[1:21:45] And they checked his heart again. and
[1:21:48] they found out he's got a heart like a
[1:21:49] little child
[1:21:54] and he's still in E tabernacle.
[1:22:01] I just wanted to
[1:22:03] leave something behind.
[1:22:08] [Applause]
[1:22:15] I'm nearly closing.
[1:22:25] He had a heart like a baby.
[1:22:28] A preacher from Freandal.
[1:22:32] His mother came to the service in Cape
[1:22:34] Town, not belonging to the church.
[1:22:41] But she came
[1:22:44] and we prayed for her.
[1:22:47] She was barren.
[1:22:50] And I think the next month or so, she
[1:22:52] fell pregnant
[1:22:55] and she brought this boy forth who is a
[1:22:58] preacher now in our
[1:23:03] church. Can thou believe?
[1:23:08] Can thou
[1:23:11] believe? Then I just want to leave
[1:23:13] something behind.
[1:23:15] [Applause]
[1:23:21] [Music]
[1:23:23] [Applause]
[1:23:29] Brother
[1:23:30] kid, brother Jerry's son, the
[1:23:34] elder was
[1:23:37] deranged. Had a deranged mind. They took
[1:23:40] him just about all over. Amen.
[1:23:44] Church to church, sang to Sangoma.
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:49] Hallelujah. But he couldn't get his
[1:23:51] healing.
[1:23:53] I do not know who told him about El
[1:23:55] Tabernacle
[1:23:57] and they brought him to Eel
[1:24:03] Tabernacle and God whipped his mind.
[1:24:08] He's in his right mind
[1:24:11] now. Listen. Listen. He's in his right
[1:24:14] mind now. He even know how to make
[1:24:19] babies.
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:24:30] I just wanted to
[1:24:32] leave something behind.
[1:24:40] All these people
[1:24:42] is right here.
[1:24:47] By the grace of God.
[1:24:57] We had brother Grant Augustine's
[1:24:59] daughter's birthday the other day and
[1:25:02] the doctor says she will never make
[1:25:06] it. She's going to die. They're going to
[1:25:09] try and save the
[1:25:11] mother. And we prayed.
[1:25:14] Brother Grant
[1:25:16] [Music]
[1:25:17] gave the testimony
[1:25:21] and two weeks ago she turned 21.
[1:25:25] [Music]
[1:25:34] And you know
[1:25:35] what? She's now ready to make
[1:25:40] ground another
[1:25:43] opa
[1:25:45] because I just left
[1:25:49] something
[1:25:54] behind. What a
[1:25:57] church. What a church.
[1:26:11] Oh, God.
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:22] We had a
[1:26:24] convention and the food ran out
[1:26:31] and there was just a little bit of food
[1:26:32] left and the queue was full
[1:26:36] very very long
[1:26:43] and they
[1:26:45] prayed The trust is prayed.
[1:26:50] And as they dish,
[1:26:52] the food got more.
[1:26:55] As they dished, the food got
[1:26:58] more. When they dished the last ditch,
[1:27:02] there was still food
[1:27:05] over. Like God multiplied the bread, he
[1:27:09] multiplied the food.
[1:27:11] I just want to
[1:27:13] leave. I just want to leave.
[1:27:18] something behind for you people.
[1:27:24] [Applause]
[1:27:37] I'm
[1:27:39] closing from
[1:27:41] Venda right up in the north near
[1:27:44] Zimbabwe. Amen.
[1:27:47] To the west,
[1:27:50] Cape Point.
[1:27:53] Right to the east, Durban.
[1:27:57] To the south of South Africa,
[1:28:00] over 10
[1:28:02] churches and thousands and thousands and
[1:28:05] thousands of souls saved.
[1:28:08] I just wanted to
[1:28:11] leave something behind.
[1:28:21] From the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the
[1:28:24] token with
[1:28:25] emotions to the four parts of the word
[1:28:29] to the four aspects of the Holy Ghost to
[1:28:32] the son of man, the son of God, the son
[1:28:35] of David, the son of righteousness, back
[1:28:37] to the son of God again into the worship
[1:28:41] like John on the aisle of atmos when the
[1:28:45] book was open.
[1:28:47] Why are you
[1:28:49] worshiping? Because Revelations 10
[1:28:53] is open
[1:28:55] and made plain and prophesied
[1:29:06] again. Healing accompanied all this.
[1:29:10] People raised from the dead.
[1:29:13] What is love?
[1:29:14] Explain. We explain what is love. The
[1:29:18] virtues came out of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:19] baptism. The guide says so. Corinthians
[1:29:24] 13 said so. Prophesying discernment on
[1:29:28] the back part of El Tabernacle. See all
[1:29:31] the prophecies there. Amen.
[1:29:36] The creation of the earth and the 70th
[1:29:39] jubilee in
[1:29:42] 1977. And give me a minstra.
[1:29:48] Let me dance.
[1:29:57] The
[1:29:59] evolution from the chimpanzeee to the
[1:30:02] serpent man to Adam to the real man, the
[1:30:07] son of man. Hallelujah.
[1:30:12] But for
[1:30:15] me, I enjoy preaching in El Tabernacle
[1:30:19] where the oil and wine is flowing.
[1:30:23] Not a painted fire
[1:30:25] because I left something
[1:30:28] behind.
[1:30:36] I just magnified my office
[1:30:40] when I
[1:30:41] said I left something behind.
[1:30:47] And what I like the most after all
[1:30:51] this, I like this very much.
[1:30:55] Praise him in the sanctuary.
[1:30:58] Now it doesn't matter which century.
[1:31:01] It could be Becket century,
[1:31:04] Ratif
[1:31:05] sanctuary, George Martin century. The
[1:31:09] Bible says praise him in the sanctuary.
[1:31:12] Why don't they praise him in the
[1:31:13] sanctuary? Psalm 100 says, "When I come
[1:31:17] into the congregation, I'm praising
[1:31:19] him."
[1:31:22] Because you got to praise him in the
[1:31:23] sanctu.
[1:31:28] Praise him in the firminant of his
[1:31:31] power, the moon and the stars and the
[1:31:34] Milky Way. Amen. And the black holes and
[1:31:37] the Milky Way and the zodiac. Praise him
[1:31:41] for his great acts.
[1:31:45] Praise he the Lord. Praise him according
[1:31:48] to his excellent greatness. He's so
[1:31:51] great. He opened the Red Sea and he's
[1:31:55] got the power to close it,
[1:31:57] too. I just wanted to leave something
[1:32:04] behind. Praise him with a
[1:32:07] trumpet. Praise him with a trumpet.
[1:32:10] Praise him with a fluid.
[1:32:12] Praise him with a sexy phone. Praise ye
[1:32:17] the Lord.
[1:32:23] Praise him in the dance. Oh, I got to
[1:32:26] say that again because they don't can't
[1:32:29] even dance anymore. Let a old man show
[1:32:32] them how to dance,
[1:32:35] man. Praise him in the dance.
[1:32:41] Don't you want to praise him in the
[1:32:42] dance?
[1:32:47] Praise him in the dance. Praise him with
[1:32:50] the strings, instruments, and
[1:32:53] organs. Praise him upon the loud
[1:32:56] symbols. Praise him upon the high
[1:32:58] sounding
[1:33:00] symbols. Now here it comes.
[1:33:03] Let
[1:33:05] everything that has
[1:33:08] breath,
[1:33:12] oxygen, praise the
[1:33:19] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:33:34] Hallelujah.
[1:33:35] [Applause]
[1:33:43] Shouldn't put this here.
[1:33:48] Hallelujah. Everything
[1:33:51] that has breath.
[1:33:57] Praise ye the Lord.
[1:34:05] I don't
[1:34:07] care if it's a lion.
[1:34:10] Let the lion's roar
[1:34:13] be praise the Lord. He's got
[1:34:19] breath. I don't care if it's a
[1:34:23] coyote. Let his back be.
[1:34:26] Praise ye the Lord.
[1:34:31] If it's the bellow of a
[1:34:34] frog, let the frog bellow be. Praise ye
[1:34:39] the Lord.
[1:34:43] If it's the chipping
[1:34:45] of
[1:34:47] cricket, let the chipping of the cricket
[1:34:50] be. Praise ye the Lord.
[1:34:57] If it's the buzzing of a bunch of bees,
[1:34:59] a swarm of bees, let the buzzing be.
[1:35:03] Praise ye the Lord.
[1:35:07] If it's El Tabernacle,
[1:35:09] [Applause]
[1:35:35] Heat. Heat.
[1:36:05] If
[1:36:07] if there's anybody here,
[1:36:10] if there's anybody here that don't want
[1:36:12] to praise him,
[1:36:14] God will wake you up one morning and
[1:36:17] you'll hear the the the the birds
[1:36:22] singing
[1:36:24] and their singing will be to you. Praise
[1:36:27] ye the Lord.
[1:36:34] If there's anybody here that don't want
[1:36:36] to praise him,
[1:36:38] Jesus says the rocks will praise him.
[1:36:49] Look at the rocks praising
[1:36:51] him. Look at it.
[1:37:12] Why are we
[1:37:13] praising? Because full obedience to the
[1:37:16] word
[1:37:18] entitle you. Don't give it. It only
[1:37:21] entitles you. For the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:37:25] Amen. My Lord. So if you obey, then
[1:37:28] you'll dance. If you obey, you will
[1:37:32] shout. If you
[1:37:34] obey, you'll speak in tongues. If you
[1:37:37] obey, you'll clap your hands. If you
[1:37:40] obey, you will dance. If you obey, you
[1:37:44] will
[1:38:04] I want to say
[1:38:07] this is why I was born.
[1:38:10] To leave something behind.
[1:38:15] I left something
[1:38:18] out. I left something
[1:38:21] out. When he opened the Bible,
[1:38:26] God wrote in the beginning. God created
[1:38:29] the heavens and the earth. In the
[1:38:30] beginning, the better sheet.
[1:38:35] And a better when you take it from
[1:38:37] the right to the left spells out the
[1:38:41] crucifixion.
[1:38:44] The Bible open up with the crucifixion.
[1:38:48] In the beginning,
[1:38:51] there's the whole thing.
[1:38:53] It opens up with the crucifixion,
[1:38:56] the
[1:38:58] barit. And it closed in Revelations 5.
[1:39:02] Behold the lamb. Amen. Full of blood. It
[1:39:06] closes the Bible and opens the Bible.
[1:39:11] For this cause, I was
[1:39:13] born to leave
[1:39:15] something behind. God bless you.
[1:39:33] Thank you for my
[1:39:37] birthday. I wanted church on my
[1:39:41] birthday and you gave me church
[1:39:45] tonight because I'm leaving something
[1:39:48] behind.
[1:39:52] Happy birthday.
[1:40:01] [Applause]
[1:40:15] [Music]
[1:40:15] [Applause]
[1:40:19] [Music]
[1:40:24] I say I know you
[1:40:29] well, but you can't lie to me with all
[1:40:33] those spoken words. You don't live.
[1:40:37] I'm trying to follow you to the end of
[1:40:41] the
[1:40:43] world. I'm trying to leave something
[1:40:47] behind. God bless you.
[1:40:51] Jesus
[1:40:55] God. Words have come from men. No Bible.
[1:41:02] Oh, but I can't help thinking that I
[1:41:05] heard the wrong
[1:41:08] cry. When the Holy Ghost is gone, my job
[1:41:12] will
[1:41:13] be the Holy Ghost is gone. My work is
[1:41:16] done. Trying to leave something
[1:41:20] behind in the footprints of Jesus.
[1:41:24] [Music]
[1:41:28] Oh, money is free. Can't help it.
[1:41:33] If God has
[1:41:35] chosen some flesh to walk
[1:41:38] in, I got to exit to
[1:41:43] [Music]
[1:41:45] you because I had to
[1:41:47] [Music]
[1:41:49] leave something
[1:41:51] behind. Oh, the future ahead is broken
[1:41:56] in red.
[1:41:59] I'm trying to leave something
[1:42:03] behind in the footprints of
[1:42:07] [Music]
[1:42:10] Jesus. This whole world is a foreign
[1:42:16] land. We swallow the moon, but we walk
[1:42:20] on the moon, but we don't know. We got
[1:42:22] salvation in our hand. Oh, we're running
[1:42:25] the seven
[1:42:29] time. Oh, I'm trying to
[1:42:34] be Have you got
[1:42:38] something? Have you got something?
[1:42:42] [Applause]
[1:42:44] We are in the wrong
[1:42:47] mind and I
[1:42:50] cannot but I
[1:42:54] know I've been to his house
[1:43:01] but I'm trying to leave something
[1:43:05] [Music]
[1:43:07] behind Jesus
[1:43:13] Now there is a piece to my skin in my
[1:43:19] brain. You can put me to bed, but you
[1:43:23] can't feel my
[1:43:25] pain. When the machine has taken me soul
[1:43:32] away, I'm trying to leave something
[1:43:37] behind in the foot of Jesus.
[1:43:44] All the money is free
[1:43:51] but more than I
[1:43:54] pray and the city for
[1:43:59] it is so hard
[1:44:03] to the future ahead is Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:44:22] Now I've got this feeling that I'm still
[1:44:25] at the
[1:44:27] shore. And my pockets don't know what it
