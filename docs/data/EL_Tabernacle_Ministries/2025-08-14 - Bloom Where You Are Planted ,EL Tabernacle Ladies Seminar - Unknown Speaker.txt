On the 9th of August, the women of EL Tabernacle gathered for a special seminar themed “Bloom Where You Are Planted.” It was a day filled with sisterhood, fellowship, and love as hearts were uplifted through worship, encouragement, and testimonies. From moments of laughter to deep reflections, the seminar reminded us that no matter where God has placed us, we can flourish in His presence.

Join us in reliving the highlights of this unforgettable day as we celebrate the beauty of ladies blooming together in faith and unity.
