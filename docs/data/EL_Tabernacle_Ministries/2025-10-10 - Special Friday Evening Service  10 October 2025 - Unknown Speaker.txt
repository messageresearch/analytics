TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Shalom saints. Can we turn to Psalm 1919? If you add it, the heavens declare the glory of God, his handiwork. Day unto day utter speech, and night unto night show with knowledge. There is no speech nor language where the voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth and the words to the end of the world. In them as he set a tabernacle for a son wishes as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoices as a strong man to run a race. His going forth is from the end of heaven, and his circuit unto the end of it, and there is nothing from the heat thereof. The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. &gt;&gt; The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing his heart, the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever. The judgment of the Lord are true and righteousness altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yay, than much fine gold. Sweeter also than the honey and the honeycomb. Moreover, by them is thy servant worn. And in keeping of them there is great reward. &gt;&gt; Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults. &gt;&gt; Keep back thy servant also from presumptions of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in my sight. Oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. What a beautiful psalm. Hallelujah. If you have a need tonight, there's elders while they prepare themselves. Let's just wave our hands. &gt;&gt; We have a shepherd tonight. &gt;&gt; He goes before me. &gt;&gt; He goes before me. &gt;&gt; Just wave your defender behind me. Defender behind me. &gt;&gt; Oh, I won't fear. &gt;&gt; I won't fear. &gt;&gt; I'm filled with anointing. &gt;&gt; I'm filled with anointing. &gt;&gt; And my cup's overflowing. My love's overflowing. &gt;&gt; No weapon can harm me. &gt;&gt; No weapon can harm me. &gt;&gt; Oh say I want thee. We sing hallelujah. I alone. &gt;&gt; He's my comfort. He's my comfort. [Music] &gt;&gt; He always guides me. You always guide me through mountains and valleys and [Music] his joy is refreshing. [Music] &gt;&gt; He restores my soul. [Music] Oh, mercy for &gt;&gt; mercy and [Music] shy. [Music] Heat. Heat. Oh, [Applause] [Applause] heat, heat. Heat. [Music] Heat.

So, let me do my part. Get out of the way so we can all be blessed tonight. Please allow me greet every brother, sister in the beautiful name of Jesus Christ. Please allow me to read the prayer request. We give God a wonderful hand. Then we read a prayer request. We pray and get out of the way. Thankful. God bless you saints. I would like to thank the Lord. Uh this night I made my request known to God before the saints. I was writing this week from Tuesday until today. On Sunday, I submitted a prayer request for God to undertake for me since I was scared and panicking. The Lord is good. All these four days, I could come out of the test room with an hallelujah in my heart because he was there to see me through. Sister Michelle, greetings, saints.

Please remember in prayer my neck and shoulder and body is full of pains. I believe when the saints begin to pray, God will heal me completely. your sister in Christ, Sister Felicia Lane. If you have a request, if you have a need, I can only remind you that early this morning, our friend went in and he prayed for us. And I just come to be a little better behind him. So, lift up your hearts, lift up your hands, don't be weary. know that we have a friend. A righteous man's reward is with our friend. Let us pray. Kind one, lovely one, beautiful one. Lord, thou art our God, our father. We come to you in confidence. We come to you knowing that you are alive. We come to you Lord knowing that in this house you are a present tense God. You are not a God of history Lord but oh God the testimonies the living testimonies are walking amongst us Lord as the angels has touched many and even tonight the angels are walking up and down the aisles touching your children. Oh God, our prayer is Lord, manifest what your apostle prayed for already this morning. Lord, as I lay my hands on the request that I've made known, doubtless thou art our father and I believe, Lord, may they come back with a testimony, giving glory to you, Lord, bless your apostle, our friend. Lord, energize his body tonight, oh God, as he brings the unsearchable riches of God to us. Lord, bless also the house of Rosco. Bless the priesthood, Lord. Bless from the youngest to the oldest in the household of Rosco. Bless your children, oh God. As we come together in this house to bring glory to you, may the praises go up higher and higher and higher tonight, oh God, in the name of Jesus, King God. Amen. [Music] Oh my appreciate our elders tonight. Hallelujah. Do you feel like going on tonight? Hallelujah. There's no place like El Tabernacle going on. Oh, I feel like like going on. Don't you feel like that? Though trials come on every man I feel love. I wonder this time we can welcome our senior pastor Jonathan Rosco. Oh, I feel &gt;&gt; I feel [Music] [Applause] I feel [Music] Do you feel like going on? [Applause] [Music] You ought to forget about your trials. You made it to the house of the Lord. [Music] Amen. [Music] Brother, sister, you may be seated today. [Music] Praise the Lord. We um just want to tell the church about four testimonies that God has done in this time which is resounding beyond explanation and it's just gives us faith to believe no matter what. God is in charge of everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a policeman in Bora. Do you know what's his name? High ranking policeman. Amen. Can you stand to your feet? I saw him come in earlier. God bless you. I was supposed to give this testimony. Thank you, my brother. We were in Ptoria. The man of God was pressed by the Holy Ghost to get to Ptoria on a Tuesday night and he was dealing with cases and the atmosphere was resounding. It was God in the house although the church was not there but God was at the church. And my precious brother came in, heard that the apostle was in the house of Al Tabernacle on the hill. [Music] And the doctors checked his heart and he was supposed to get a booking to do something on the heart. And the man was shook up because they checked them all the time because in the police force they check them and he was getting himself ready for an operation. But they the devil lost out because the doctor was at the church [Applause] and he said, "Uh, I don't know how am I going to get this booking. There's no place to get me a booking." He got the booking and the doctor checked him and he says, "You got a baby heart after the apostle prayed." [Applause] From a problem to a miracle. It was an instant miracle. [Applause] I know he'll never be the same again because that was God. [Music] He believed that if the apostle he came to the house and he knew the apostle was there and he knew if the apostle pray for him, he won't need an op. And God gave him a baby. The doctor was confused and he's still here. Amen. Am I right, my brother? There's a man with the testimony. Amen. Then brother Daniel, the electrician wife had to go for ops and the last op was quite serious with the cancer. Came for prayer. God made a way. You will ask and God will give it. Normally when the cancer spreads in the woman, it goes to the organs. It goes all over. But God made a way. Then the devil wasn't happy with the testimony. Then brother Daniel was busy grinding to make a carport at home and the ladder swept out under him and the grinder cut him here near the juggler pipe. When he got to the hospital it was already bubbling here. The doctors could not believe the man was alive but there was a god in the house. Instead of a funeral, instead of the juggler pipe, God stopped him to die and bleed to death. The grinder cut him, but God was in here. And God saved him. God made a way for him. And I want to tell you tonight, he can make a way for you also. You just got to believe in a man. All things are possible. Praise the Lord. But the strike foster phoned me to say his wife needs to go for an operation. They detected cancer in her breast. And I told the apostle, the apostle told me, "Jaw." The apostle calls me Jaw. It's my house name. &gt;&gt; Jo. She'll be all right. I just said it to him. The apostle told me she'll be all right. Now, I'm here tonight to tell you she went in the Tuesday, the Wednesday, she was home. All things are possible if you believe there's a God, a doctor, a physician in this house. God bless you. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise and you can go home with an answer as well. [Applause] [Music] We should be running around this place. Hey. Hey, Dr. Los. [Applause] [Music] Somebody say hallelujah. Somebody say hosana. [Applause] [Music] Woo. [Applause] We just want to use this opportunity to welcome all the visitors in the house of Rosco. There's a very special gentleman, Mr. Desmond Gil. He's one of the top golfers that plays with the morning stars in our midst. We want to acknowledge you and we want to welcome you and may you enjoy yourself. [Applause] [Music] This is your father's [Music] Oh my [Music] god. [Applause] Holy [Music] Ghost might [Music] be.

I want to say good evening &gt;&gt; wherever the streaming goes right around the world. &gt;&gt; Just want to tell you This is the night and the day &gt;&gt; when the King of glory [Applause] &gt;&gt; cried out, &gt;&gt; "It is finished. Lord, I am finished. It is finished. &gt;&gt; Redemption pay. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're glad you come from the east and west. You come from lands of far. &gt;&gt; You fly in, &gt;&gt; you bus in, &gt;&gt; you train in, you taxi in, you coober in to one place to be here tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anyway, we together again &gt;&gt; just praising the Lord. And if we have visitors here &gt;&gt; and you don't understand why we're making such a lot of noise, &gt;&gt; we just want to tell you, &gt;&gt; we're excited about that man. We uh we came back a little late last week after the party and then I relax and I put on football. Uh that's my my weak spot &gt;&gt; and uh yet Chelsea and Liverpool &gt;&gt; was playing. And brothers and sisters, it was it was chaos. It was total madness &gt;&gt; because a little Brazilian on the last minute scored the winning goal. &gt;&gt; And when that ball went in, I sat back. I said, "Now I want to see the spectators or the bartakers." I didn't see any spectators. I only saw bartakers. They were jumping. But &gt;&gt; but don't tell J I was one of them that was jumping cuz I'm glad those guys lost. [Applause] But the thing hit me again once more. They could jump like that for a piece of leather. What about us? Why can't we jump? [Applause] and especially &gt;&gt; to the one &gt;&gt; that conquered [Applause] &gt;&gt; hell, &gt;&gt; dead, and the grave. [Applause] Bullmont. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Jonathan told you about those miracles that took place. &gt;&gt; But I heard about Father Kirkwin's wife, Mercedes. &gt;&gt; She had a very, very bad kidney problem and they wanted to put her on dialysis. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when she went, I think a week or two ago, they checked her up and they can't believe it that the kidneys is more stronger than ever. There's a God in this church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I thank God for the healing &gt;&gt; and um I just like to thank the um trustees wives and that when I come to church there's some coffee for me behind in the minister's room. Now I don't have a buffazi. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So when I come most of the time they come through but when I come here I get a nice cappuccino. God bless you as you go out of your way. If I am a man of God, &gt;&gt; now listen, &gt;&gt; listen. I'm here 62 years. &gt;&gt; I never came for your woman. I can look at every woman straight in the eye here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I never came for your woman. &gt;&gt; 62 here. &gt;&gt; And you guys that's got some money in the bank. I know all of you. I never one time knock at your door for money. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So I also didn't come for your money. But I came &gt;&gt; to see you Hello. Ready? [Applause] And then it's brother Julian. Yeah. Julian Bolton. Julian who move you to after 8 you know I just hope that uh that's not backsliding you know I want to thank Julian and brother Charles's wife for the printing of the books I never even read these books so next week you know I've been very very busy &gt;&gt; so next week I have to sit now look how thick this book is. And this is my ministry. My heart is aching to go into this book. And Julian, I would like to know what is this book going to cost? We want to see if we can't make it available to the church at a reduced price. But everybody should have this As you know, all the books that we have printed and all the tapes that I made, over 3,000 tapes, I didn't get one cent from it. I don't get the money. [Applause] We put it back into the works of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then he made another book, the trumpets [Applause] which I didn't have an opportunity to get into it. And I think there's another book So, normally I knock these things off quickly so that they get printed, but they've been waiting on me. I've been in the pulpit most of the time, but I hope next week I'll be able to go into it and we'll tell you what it's going to cost and what we're going to reduce on it. So, I want to thank you, brother Julian. Amen. That concludes my announcements. And now let's get into business. &gt;&gt; Why we are here tonight. I would like to read two scriptures. Matthew 25:10, Revelations 4:1. And I had phone calls from all over &gt;&gt; just on what we already preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what we preach here &gt;&gt; is not preached anywhere. Psalm. Let us read the scripture of a message from the Lord. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; If you can help me to read Matthew 25:10. Let's read. [Applause] Watch that. &gt;&gt; They went into the marriage &gt;&gt; and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; That means just before the door got shut, &gt;&gt; the door was open. And they went in. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Went in with him. &gt;&gt; The bride and the groom &gt;&gt; went into the marriage with him. and the other five virgins was outside the door. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So that means right there the oil change their bodies [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; otherwise they can't go in &gt;&gt; the quickening power &gt;&gt; change their bodies. so that they can go in &gt;&gt; with the lamb. &gt;&gt; So before we go in, &gt;&gt; we need the oil, the Holy Ghost to quicken our bodies to go in. Amen. &gt;&gt; The other scripture, Revelations 4:1, read come up where he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, the door was open &gt;&gt; and she come in. &gt;&gt; Same like Matthew 25. [Applause] What a thing. &gt;&gt; Now I want to say this. Let us pray first. Father, we are just nothing in front of you. &gt;&gt; Anything that we have and will have &gt;&gt; was because of you. &gt;&gt; We pray that you would undertake for us. Bless the people. &gt;&gt; Let us come this Friday night to be assembled together. &gt;&gt; We have church on a Friday night. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because it all happened on a Friday. &gt;&gt; May you bless the word and may we go out here more wiser. I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, each one of you is here tonight, &gt;&gt; whether you on the streaming, &gt;&gt; whether you're in England, America, wherever this broadcast goes, &gt;&gt; whether you're on the streaming in South Africa tonight, &gt;&gt; each one of you, &gt;&gt; every one of you, &gt;&gt; each one of you here in the church, today. &gt;&gt; Every one of you [Applause] &gt;&gt; that came to church today, &gt;&gt; you just accepted an invitation of God. So give yourself a hand clap. &gt;&gt; You just accepted &gt;&gt; an invitation &gt;&gt; from the greatest man. that ever learn &gt;&gt; because he told you come unto me all he that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. come an invitation and you came tonight accepting the invitation. Hallelujah. Bye. [Music] As you see that day approach on Matthew 25, &gt;&gt; see that you assemble together because it's the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Assemble together. You accepted the invitation. &gt;&gt; Let us make full use of it. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus, King God, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; never turn down an invitation. You invite him, &gt;&gt; he'll come. &gt;&gt; He'll come. &gt;&gt; He'll come. &gt;&gt; And now we say the same thing. If you invite us, &gt;&gt; we'll be here. and therefore &gt;&gt; I chose &gt;&gt; and entitled this message &gt;&gt; the greatest &gt;&gt; message &gt;&gt; ever preached. Hallelujah. and for inspiration, the prophetic insight &gt;&gt; in Matthew 15. &gt;&gt; Now, you can't have a message &gt;&gt; unless you have a messenger. [Music] [Applause] And I know that there's a lot of messages. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of preachers &gt;&gt; in the pulpit tonight &gt;&gt; and tomorrow &gt;&gt; and Sunday. &gt;&gt; A lot of preachers. And as I told Daniel that year, I said, Daniel, you know, there's a lot of lot of preachers, &gt;&gt; in the message &gt;&gt; and in the denominations &gt;&gt; and in the churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That they put there &gt;&gt; and that feed them garbage. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So if you have a preacher &gt;&gt; that feed you garbage, &gt;&gt; then you have just you just got yourself a higher killer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; He is in the pulpit &gt;&gt; for ulterior motives. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; He's in the pulpit to kill the church. &gt;&gt; He's in the pulpit to better himself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And they are hired killers. Amen. &gt;&gt; They kill the children of God. &gt;&gt; And you say, "What do you mean, brother Brandham? Preach a message. I indict this generation &gt;&gt; for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ." And the Bible says there where Jerusalem, they who the hire killers crucified the king of glory. Who crucified him? Priest &gt;&gt; hired killers, &gt;&gt; but an eel tabernacle. There is a man I can turn on the light. Say amen somebody. So, &gt;&gt; we did explain &gt;&gt; with an interview with Edgar &gt;&gt; the prophetic insight &gt;&gt; and why we're going to preach on &gt;&gt; the greatest message &gt;&gt; ever preached. Now before preaching this message, &gt;&gt; we will need tonight &gt;&gt; to have an introduction into it. &gt;&gt; It's too great and I can't I can't wait &gt;&gt; for the next meeting when I'm going to go into it. &gt;&gt; But tonight is just the introduction. So 40 years ago, I told you El Tabernacle &gt;&gt; that I do not go into the study go looking for a message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When I go into the study, I already have my message &gt;&gt; because your message comes from God. &gt;&gt; It's a inspiration from God. &gt;&gt; I already have a message. &gt;&gt; But when I go into the study, &gt;&gt; I write down my sermon. And when I come to church, I deliver the sermon. But the message come from God. &gt;&gt; That's why we sang. There is a message &gt;&gt; from the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A message unto you. This pooper dreams. So &gt;&gt; I need to remind you &gt;&gt; that the prophet calls all the other messages outside of Revelations 10. &gt;&gt; You'll never hear any minister preach on Revelations 10. &gt;&gt; And neither you're going to get it from a Bible school, &gt;&gt; neither from a university, &gt;&gt; neither from a professor. They don't touch Revelations 10 and they don't touch Matthew 25. But here we're in the University of eternity. And the prophet says in Revelation series 19:16, organizations and their flowery messages &gt;&gt; won't shake the devil &gt;&gt; over the head. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Is flowery messages. &gt;&gt; People come in just the way they go out &gt;&gt; and they go out just the way they come in. &gt;&gt; Why? That flowery messages is doing nothing. &gt;&gt; We don't need flowery messages. We don't need intellectual speeches. But we need the Holy Spirit to enter in to the message and bring a shaking that it'll shake you and shake you and shake you until you get up. All that you hear on TBNN, all that you hear on the television, all that you hear right there on the radio, all that you hear in the message groups is little flowery messages. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That tickle the flesh &gt;&gt; and don't stir the soul. We don't want our flesh tickled. We want our souls to be restored for it restore my soul on tbn. Maya man everything of that woman is demonic. &gt;&gt; Her hair is demonic. &gt;&gt; Her lipstick is demonic. &gt;&gt; Her trousers she wear is demonic. But the people flock there &gt;&gt; and let Edgar Orosco tell you turn tonight. &gt;&gt; If you dance with the devil, [Applause] &gt;&gt; listen, &gt;&gt; if you dance with the devil, &gt;&gt; then you just escorted yourself to hell. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you go with those ministers and dance with them, then you just escorted yourself to hell. That's why this will never die. This is a message from the Lord. This is a man of God here. [Applause] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We dance with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't hear anybody preach on Revelations 10. &gt;&gt; So, you know what I done? &gt;&gt; I shut my ears a long time ago &gt;&gt; with what all the critic says about me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I watch my fruit of my ministry. &gt;&gt; I make my calling and election sure. &gt;&gt; So you close your ears &gt;&gt; to the clinics &gt;&gt; that says you look like a Omar &gt;&gt; with your long dress. We don't listen to clinics anymore. We pass. &gt;&gt; I don't listen to critics anymore. &gt;&gt; I'm like the weather. &gt;&gt; I'm like the weather. Unlike the weather, &gt;&gt; the weather don't take no nonsense &gt;&gt; and notice &gt;&gt; from the critics. &gt;&gt; If it rains &gt;&gt; and the critic says it's too wet, then it rains on. &gt;&gt; It doesn't listen to the critics. If it's hot and you say it's too hot and then the sun starts burning you, it goes on shining. It doesn't listen to clinics &gt;&gt; when it snows &gt;&gt; and it's cold. our ears. And now we got one of the best churches in the message because we close our ears. [Applause] [Music] And today they even lie in the pulpit. &gt;&gt; You hear them saying, "Can you feel the anointing? &gt;&gt; Then there is no anointing. &gt;&gt; It's a lie. They had thousands and thousands of people &gt;&gt; right up here with that big church. &gt;&gt; They even had to close the road and they were pulling for money all the time. &gt;&gt; And just 20 minutes preaching. &gt;&gt; And after they preached, the pastor came up. Can you feel the anointing? Yeah, you only anointed their pockets to get their money, &gt;&gt; but the anointing of God wasn't there. &gt;&gt; We don't preach money here. We preach the word of Almighty God. [Music] You don't have to say, "Can you feel the Holy Ghost? Can you feel the anointing?" &gt;&gt; That's not Bible. &gt;&gt; This is what happens &gt;&gt; when the anointing is there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Close your eyes and say, "Lord, seal me. Lord, feel me. This is your night. This is the light for you to feel the anointing. [Applause] [Music] Oh, wait. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. [Applause] You can be baptized with the Holy Ghost. You can be sealed away. Hallelujah. You can grab a hold of the altar tonight. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] Forever I visitation of the angel in South Africa. Here he is. Yay.
