Description:
As The Apostle lifted up Bro. Branham’s hands, as Aaron and Hur held up Moses’ hands...  So does this Rabbi come behind it all, to lift up Bro Branham’s hands!


Exodus 17:12 - But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
how many Christian exchange brandom for a medium for an antichrist for a false prophet for a deceiver how can it be what a mental perversion what a spiritual Madness what a religious foolishness now if John the Baptist was more than a prophet and John did not operate any healing Miracles or any Wonder but he simply announced the arrival of the Messiah what about then the ministry of William ranam who in addition to the great wonders and the wonderful and Powerful Miracles that he performed and the signs and the visions and the prophecies and The Apparition of angels and the pillar of of of cloud and the voice from Heaven and the opening of The Seven Seals and beside all this his ministry that forun the Rapture of the bride and the second coming of the Lord H what about the ministry of branam branam who who discerned the thoughts of men's heart in all details branam who commanded the demon to leave the sick and the disease disappeared Bram who called the dead to life and during his ministry seven dead people resurrected branam who received visions that came to pass to the letter Bram who interpreted the dreams of the people without them telling him the dream but first he told them what they had dreamed and then he gave them the interpretation like Daniel did Bram whom the angel of the Lord spoke face to face Bram whom the Lamb of God opened the Seven Seals and revealed to him the contents Bram through which Ministry God did many all those wonderful things is therefore branam more than a prophet yes he is more than a prophet I firmly believe that anyone who says a single word against this Prophet or against the message that he preached it will never be forgiven never forgiven why not be forgiven given because he who speaks against this work of the Holy Ghost in This man does not speak against the man but against God against the Holy Spirit and this is a blasphemy yes one of these days the Bride of Jesus Christ will be taken away and you will be left here in the Great Tribulation where there will be weeping nashing of teeth if you reject the ministry of William ranam you have rejected Jesus Christ himself why because it was the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ that was working through William Marian branam did not Jesus said that whosoever receives the one that he sends receives Jesus and did not Jesus said that whosoever rejects the one that he sends rejects Jesus if you reject this ministry of branam one of these days you will say the same thing that the Jews said in front of Jesus crucified truly this man was the son of God they recognized him too late they recognized him after they had rejected him and crucified him him remember it is not what you say of ranam that determinates who is William branam no but it is what you say of branam that determines what you are and what will be of you I concluded by repeating the question what do you say of William Mariam BR if you do not know anything about the ministry of William branam I suggest you to visit the sites that you will find Hereafter investigate examine search the scripture do not stand on here say will you listen to my heartfelt advice will you be humble enough in your spirit to examine the preaching of William ranham comparing it not with the belief of your denomination but with the Bible or you want to be part of that large number of believers who say Lord Lord but do not do the will of God and Jesus on that day not now will cast you away from his presence telling you that he has never known you as it is written in Matthew 7 verse 23 I leave it to you the [Music] choice
