[music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're together again. It was so beautiful. I was sitting in the car and I watched all the sisters was trickling into this place and it's been such a beautiful scene for Hey, [applause] [applause] they they look like angels. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; moving to a specific place and I said to myself, it had come it was not in vain. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; My loving is not in vain. &gt;&gt; I I thought as the marched in here. I thought when the devil look over the benister of his domain and they look at them, I wonder what does he think? I'm sure He must be jealous, you know. [applause] Because this is just a different bunch. Not the same people. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; So um tonight this question and answer is not so much preaching. Sometimes wonder why we have things like this but they sang the song. Yeah. Jesus is the answer. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; And we are the question. We got so many questions. So I'm so glad that he is the answer. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Because before there could be a question, &gt;&gt; there had to be an answer. [applause] So, the university students threw up some questions that we're going to answer tonight because we believe that he is the king of El Tabernacle. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; and he wants to answer you. So let us just bow our eyes and look towards him. Our heavenly father, I think it's Paul that says he's the greatest, the chiefest sinner of them all. We come to you if we failed you during the course of this day. May you forgive us what we thought and whatever we done that don't satisfy you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; in thought, word, and deed. Forgive us. We are here tonight because there's questions. Lord, for every question [applause] there's an answer because Jesus is the answer. [applause] I do pray that you would bless your children here, the ones you washed in your blood. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; that we could come out on a Thursday night and have church. So we love church Lord. May you further undertake for us [applause] in Jesus name. You may be seated now. We sorry for the brethren that stands around the hallway. Yeah. We didn't think it's going to be packed like this. Um we were just coming to the university students and um but um it is not what it is. So please just let your hair down and don't look at me as if I come from I do come from space. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; But I'm with you for a long time now. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um, just do me a favor. Turn around and just tell the one next to you, just cool it, my brother. Everything is fine. Did you do it with a feeling? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; casual that I had grow down and um just have a little bit of a difference than sitting in El Tabernacle. I just want the deacons also to sit tonight. Leave the people alone tonight. If they want to laugh, if they want to, you know, we just have one wonderful time together tonight. [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about Logan. I'll call him up afterwards to loosen you up a little bit. Amen. So, um we um we're in the world one time and then during the week we used to go to Bic. We came home 12:00 the night and uh we went to work the next day. &gt;&gt; Now, why can't we come out tonight at 12:00? [cheering] [applause] [applause] Well, I see the UEFA matches on And it start late, you know, 10:00, you get done there at 12:00. Some happy, some sad, &gt;&gt; but we are here tonight. [applause] &gt;&gt; We have a joy that They cannot diminish. [cheering] [applause] So now I I I don't mind going brother sorry going home 12:00 tonight because So I got no problems. I don't know about the other guys. You know, okay, questions and answers. Wherever you go, there's a question. Now, why this? Why must this be so? Why why must the tax be so high? Why must I struggle so financially? Why don't I have money? Why can't I get an auntie? Question, question, question. And that's a part of our life. Since you know yourself, you have questions. And one thing I notice about God, God likes to question. I always wonder why does brother Brennham like to have meetings, question and answer meetings until I dissected the word and I found out that God is the one that always ask questions. He asked the question and when I look down here I can't see this. God like to ask questions. He asked a question in Genesis 3:9. And he says, "And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, where art thou?" Question. I know where I left you, Adam. I left you being behind holiness. But where are you now? And I wonder if God isn't asking that question a lot in our time. My son, where are you? You find people that has been with El Tabernacle, but you can't help to ask the question, where are you now? Question. Genesis 3:13. And the Lord God said unto the woman, "What is this that thou has done?" Question. And the woman says, "The serpent beg me and
