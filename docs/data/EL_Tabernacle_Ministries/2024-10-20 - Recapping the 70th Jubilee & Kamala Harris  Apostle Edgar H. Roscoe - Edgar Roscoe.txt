TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good evening El Tabernacle and um listeners around the world that's going to listen to this clip that I made that I'm going to make and um we greet you in the name of our King God the soon coming Messiah to the Jews but first to the Gentiles the Lord Jesus Christ we are actually forced to make this clip because there is still people around going and saying that I prophesied that the Lord is coming and um I think brother Kurt told us not the other day another brother told him and then when the brother went to go check up he saw that I never said a thing like that and he had to phone C back and apologize not in our church in another church the r will also told me a brother told him that and then he told the brother I was in that meeting can you tell me where on that tape does he make that prediction that you're talking about and the brother couldn't answer him so I um I just fell to save God uh our church because I'm not send to these guys in the message you know and I I I have a responsibility uh for my church and uh that's why brother Branham laid hands on me and Prophet visit South Africa because he saw that I would have a church or churches and I will be have to be responsible for them and I will actually preach exactly what he preach or say exactly what he says or prophesy again what Revelations 107 has brought forth so that's why we are just recapping um uh the uh Jubilee message that I preach which has gone around the world everybody heard it and um it wasn't done in secret I preach it all over the world uh I let it go all over the world and uh uh but you know people when you are a Target they try to get any little thing to put on you and make you wrong that's why Jesus says blessed are they if they speak all manner of wrong things lying you know for my name's sake blessed are ye so we thought about recapping just for Al Tabernacle sake and uh I got to a place where I don't care about anybody else if somebody wants to know something I will have all the patience in the world to sit with him if they haven't got to arant Spirit and if they come from other church and try and do my best to show them where we stand and uh without trying to steal Souls but uh time has gone by and uh you don't find people wanting to know more about God they um seated in their churches and their doctrines so that's why I said I I have to care just for El tacle now we have to recap a few things here for a couple of minutes and because people are going around saying I said the Rapture is going to take place last year 2310 2024 last year was 49 years so they were wrong they were lying you know last year was not the 70th Jubilee last year was 49 years you know wedn they were be 50 years but they said I said last year and that just shows you that they do not understand uh the 70th Jubilee and the dates and stuff like that that's why their pastors don't understand it and their pastors can't preach on it and now because I preach on it and I made sense to it I must be attacked and stupid guys would come and you said no don't say that well uh brother Paul says in Galatians who has bewitch you you foolish Galatians you know so were and foolishly attack me and when I said man hey uh 2023 is not the 70th Jubilee then everybody backed off you know and uh it showed me that they didn't understand a bit on what I was saying therefore it is for my church and we don't care what anybody else say about it so they lied about me saying the rapure will take place last year you know and last year was not the 70th Jubilee now this year 2024 which is Wednesday coming is the 70th Jubilee and the changed the tune and said I said the Rapture will take place Wednesday which is another line I have never said a thing like that and uh I cannot understand they call themselves The Bride but they're lying like this they call themselves well we got love but they like like this you don't find love in untruth love rejoice in truth you must speak truth that's love but these all these guys are lying they're a bunch of liars you know and uh to me don't come and preach love to me you know because none of you Sayes it and I proved it What Love Is Love is a baptism of the Holy Ghost full stop nothing more nothing less so that's why we put the clip on social media what I said it's on it's on there for months we checked it up it will be a year and a couple of months that we put the clip up there to explain the whole thing you know and yet they go on for the whole year so how would you miss it if I put the clip on there for the whole year so I got to come back again now and do it again you know so that they could be judged on their lives with their pastors and all second point I invited pastors of other churches to be in that meeting and all our preachers because brother Brandon said said um don't say I said that 1977 the Lord is coming he said he three times in uh Daniel 70 weeks and yet look how the media went on that brother BR prophesied now we're not prophesying I never prophesied and I never said thus say the Lord you know on the 70 weeks of Daniel there nothing like that and brother Bram says he never said it is thus sayth the Lord so uh but they finish him up until we came out with the 70th Jubilee and showed exactly that brother B was right 1977 was a start of the 70th J cuz 1974 it started to 2024 so uh required him down praise God that we could be Protectors of this wonderful message this is the clip we played for months or one year and yet pastors are lying I never change anything it's told the 70th week 70th Jubilee Wednesday coming it cannot be changed you can't shift it because that's the amount of time given to the Jews so nobody can change it it's the 70th Jubilee so this is the club that we played for a year is there a time that men will be cut off according to God's Bible when will the 70th Jubilee be the expected time the desired time for God to come not the desired time that Edgar Rosco said because everybody said something the 7even day Adventist also had a date and it failed the Jehovah Witness had a date and it failed because it was their date but the 7th Jubilee is nobody's date but yahweh's date that's the difference Lord what will the end be go your way there it's concealed until the time of the end when you see a preacher preach on maratha then it sounds for you what will the end be that's why he says it will be the aering in of the Millennium because the 6,000 years is finished we moving into the seventh Hallelujah the only thing that can change that date is the long suffering of Christ nothing more my spirit shall not always strive with men cut off time have you realized that such a short time left in the short time God in the short time amen Los Angeles has to go down in the short time that woman has to raise in America and 2024 is the USA elections again could it be the date that that woman will be elected that will cause America to go down yes B believe yes you will see them going down Los Angeles we are not here forever there must come an appointed time for God to come and close isn't there an appointed time for men on the earth yes there is you have prayed maybe five times a day like the Muslims maybe three times a day like to choose but now you have to pray without ceasing so there you have it we played this for over a year and how could you misunderstand it is my problem it just shows you jealousy and it just shows you that they are looking to get something thing on me so uh I just want to clear it with my people I don't care what the other people say about it I want to clear it with my people which I did so uh that's the clip now the big question is now who said that the 70th Jubilee is the rapture and the ushering in of the Millennium who said that I never did it doesn't come from me then who said it now let's welcome brother brandham to the podium to play Daniel 70 weeks tape now mark down in your book a little scripture here I want to give you Leviticus 25 beginning with the eth verse God called a jubilee every 49th year the 50th year was a jubilee we know that yeah we understand that from the first Jubilee of Leviticus 258 and 1977 will be the 70th Jubilee making exactly 3,430 years amen hallelujah Jubilee means going up amen Rel oh we're watching for the coming of that glad Millennium day when our blessed Lord shall come and catch his waiting briway oh the world is growing crying for that day of sweet release when our savior shall come back to earth again we got 17 years left until 77 will be the 70th Jubilee since the beginning of jubilees amen and what will it be oh brother watch close now don't miss it it'll be the Jubilee of the going up of the Gentile bride and the return of Christ to the Jews am when they go out of bondage amen because Jesus did not say no man could know the year month or week in which his coming was to be completed so I repeat I sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration ation that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and Usher in the Millennium so now I'd like to ask you now who said the 70th Jubilee is the rapture me your Prophet said so so you want to say that I am wrong I don't got it from the prophet yeah you read the prophet said so so blame the prophet if you if you say no no no it doesn't and you got all these other excuses say you against your own Prophet you're talking against your own own Prophet I only quoted what he said it doesn't come from me Paul says that the word of God come out of you or did he come to you this word came to me from brother brandham so brother brandham said it is the rapture not Ed garos so get your facts straight I am quoting your prophet and you can now go against it he'll meet you at the Judgment bar there is make Believers in this message Great Pretenders that they believe the message but they can't even take a quote like this how could they be in the message so you either know the message or you a foolish version in the message or you a great Pretender you're only pretending that you believe the Bible says so BC 538 Gabriel came to Daniel and spoke to him about it the chronologist with a many books says so and now the prophet William Brenham said so July the 30th of the 8th month 1961 said so and I edar Rosco underline it when is the 70th Jubilee 77 is the beginning of the 70th Jubilee because the 70th Jubilee started in 1974 so he said in 1977 we're in the 70th Jubilee so I clarifi that thing so regardless of what you say it's the 70th Jubilee so you going to ask brother Brandon what you want to ask brother brandom don't come and ask me I will speak to my church on Sunday on Saturday at the combined meeting I said it's not my date but it's God's appointed time he can change it in in his longsuffering like I brought it out on that message but in the longsuffering all the times that examples I gave no soul got saved so think about after Wednesday if you don't understand him then it's your baby and your pastor's baby you are trying to too hard to find me wrong and God protected me oh Edgar osar said he's greater than brother brandham he is the eighth messenger is Jehovah God now he said is the rapture is going to take place he's messing around with human like Rin Thompson said he's not that boy in Propet visit South Africa and no proof I ask you please on all those points send me the tape where I said those things is now for how many years you guys cannot produce the tape where I said these things so you will work it on with God very soon at the day of judgment I explained this next Saturday at our combine I'll be and I said in a clip it'll be an ordinary day I would like you to write it down or make an indelible mark on your mind what I'm going to tell you you'll see the 23rd will come it's on the Wednesday I will be here but you'll see it's going to be an ordinary day it's going to look as if nothing has happened yes Mark that [Music] down they'll still have church Elders there's still going to be alter calls there's still going to be people that wants to give their hearts to the Lord the surely is going to be weeping and crying but it's going to be too late for Tears [Music] you mark that down because in that [Music] Dimension it's going to be all [Music] over Israel when God told told them to take the land they didn't and God wanted to destroy them immediately and and Moses begged and he says I won't destroy them but they still going to die they went on for 40 years serving God crying having a prophet eating Mana but they were cut off they died all of them but in the [Music] natural it looked all right and if I am right which I very much doubt I'm wrong I don't know why all the ministers are calling some are calling and some are dying [Applause] it is like that already how is it going to be when the thing is cut off completely in the message World it will go on the same like it goes on every [Music] day but if you're spiritual if you're in this prophetic class [Music] I'm sure you already saw [Music] things so all that I told you to make a mental note and a note in your Bible because it cannot be moved it cannot be changed the time Factor runs out the 23rd one of the Jewish Rabbi said we won't forget the 23rd of October and going to read Daniel 70 weeks God told Daniel there's only 70 weeks allotted to the Jews 70 weeks and not more time they were given 70 weeks that was that time that God was going to take away all transgressions that means that I'll be back with Israel [Applause] read okay that is um what I said in the 70th Chile now the camia ER quote we were first to point out that that quote speak of two women a natural woman that will be chosen vice president and then president and the Roman Catholic church so either Camila or Trump choosing will be bad Trump can bring in the Roman Catholic Church money prosperity and Camila can bring in that woman that will destroy America I said it from that time brother Bram says 1960 the 7 month 16th day he says thus sayith the Lord in other words God said it not brother Brenham God said it there'll be a woman rule a woman rule before the end time listen here before the end time she'll either be president or vice president or the Roman Catholic Church listen there's three important points in this quote Point number one before the end time why does he say before the end time because the seventh vision is the end time the abor the seventh trumpet Revelations 11:14 the Third Woe cometh quickly it comes quickly after her that's the end remember that so her coming in is not the end of the world get me straight please but the bride is gone then when this happens when the bomb Falls when that wo comes remember the bride is gone before the end of the world in other words she won't see the end of the world so brother BR says a woman will rise she'll be he says she'll be president or vice president well she's running for both she already fulfilled the one she is and was the vice president and now she's running to be a candidate for presidency so the quote is running with God's will so far we're going to bring this back again to you her eyes was 1990 Deputy district attorney 20 courtroom prosecutor San Francisco two uh3 district attorney 2010 general attorney 2016 US senator 2020 elected vice president 2024 president candidate isn't the scary straight with the quote anybody can see this could it be El Tabernacle could it be so the quot is running with God's will so far from the same quote from that time he says or the Catholic church so here we see distinctly two woman a natural woman that will be voted in and a spiritual woman which is the Roman Catholic Church that's not voted in she just comes in but the natural woman that will be president she gets voted in so I never saw this just the other day and as I went through the quotes and I think there about 200 or so many quotes or even more uh and all if you read really those quotes you'll see he speaks every time of two human that's why we have two candidates for the two woman one is Trump and the other one is Camila one will be Camila that is voted in so far we see how votes wi the other one might be Trump that will let the Roman Catholic Church come in because of the pressure of the Roman Catholic church because America owes her trillions of dollars they can't even pay back the interest so World should put the screws on Trump if he gets elected and he will give in then to her and afterwards speak as the dragon it's two scenarios here because the Roman Catholic Church when he says the Roman Catholic Church he says I got it in Brackets and you know what that mean I don't have to take it to school so um he says all the Catholic Church to woman then he concludes the quote by saying thus saith the Lord so it must come to pass is this the season for it you might have to check that thing out so the you have 70 weeks 70 Jubilee and also Camila all speaking about the End Time season is Right 70 weeks 70 Daniel is going to be settled on Wednesday and then the elections we're waiting to see which one comes in to bring in one of the two human you know and a person wonders about the Roman Catholic Church Revelations 17 very very much you worried about it but both is a worry But the irony of the thing the bottom line the colel is that we are at the end the ceiling will go on the regardless of what happens the ceiling is going to go on so I would like to on Saturday show you what brother Brenham says what's going to take place if these things fall in line it's only the elections in front of us and then he says something and I feel sorry for the Brethren that's in this message that has rejected the Holy Ghost and actually gone for a Baptist way of worship I feel sorry for them after Saturday you'll see what a mistake they made I can't but help bringing this up and I know I said that I will never mention him again but I think about Raymond Thompson about 15 20 years ago with a h Revelation and I was walking up to him and ask him you see the Holy Ghost never came so the Holy Ghost never came in 1979 when it fell in El Tabernacle and then went over to America and and uh many other places so uh he was very very rude and I'm glad that angel of God was there he wrote everything down he will meet one another there and he said uh you preach what you want to preach we preach what we want to preach and um then that thing didn't work out because it was a bunch of nonsense third phase worship and all that was all nonsense you know so that's why I just wonder if these guys didn't bless from the Holy Ghost and now it's too late to get it I watch them every now and then their services especially when they preach and I don't feel no Holy Ghost there so um we have come to the end it's going to be worse because God is now going to go extra mile with Israel and I want to bring it out next week on Saturday to show you exactly what's going to happen then so may God bless you and um brother the B says in the token this is what he says the sleeping virgin coming in trying to buy oril that is that time when the bride went in and the rest of them was left here did you ever think what happened they went right ahead preaching and thinking they were getting Soul saved and everything and did not know it they knew nothing about it the Church of War thinking souls are being saved and everything else and the church is already the bride sealed away don't know it certainly that's exactly what the scripture Noah went in the ark God seal it out truly and the time will come when men and women will cry to God and even think that they've got something when they haven't it's exactly right the scripture speaks that amen there you have it that is what's going to happen they'll go on with the church services already we know God is gone we already know it everybody knows it all of ministers knows it that God is not there so we need Scripture to back us up there's a quote and I brought out most of the scriptures on Saturday night in uh Dar to show you how God cuts off the holy ghost from the people so you have all those quotes to go with us quote and uh we write at the end it is finished you'll be sealed up with whatever you have I remember years ago brother Raymond Thompson used to like to say in our church be careful what you're doing whatever nonsense you catch on there's going to be a time that the Holy Ghost is going to seal that nonsense in you and you'll never be able to overcome and I want agree with that that is what is going to happen after Wednesday but as I said it already happened we see one another on Wednesday and then Saturday as well and uh we right at the end when the cup of the amorites Wednesday will be full and I'll tell you why I said it will be full God bless you thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
