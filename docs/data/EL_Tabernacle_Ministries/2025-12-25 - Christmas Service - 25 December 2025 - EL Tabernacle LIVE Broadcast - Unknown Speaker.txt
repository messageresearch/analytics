Whatever you just love on him. &gt;&gt; Let me see you [music] above the earth. [singing] The angels &gt;&gt; one more time for our savior. Oh, tell the Lord. &gt;&gt; Tell it on your [music] mind. over the hill [music and singing] that Jesus Christ is born. &gt;&gt; Put your hands together. Down in [singing and music] a lonely manger, our [singing] humble Christ was born and brought [singing and music] us salvation. There is a sales [music] everywhere. Tell it up [music] that Jesus [singing] Christ is born. Oh my god. [music] [singing] [music] Jesus Christ. [music] &gt;&gt; Let me see you wherever you are. Let me see you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Who you going to tell? &gt;&gt; Going to tell somebody. &gt;&gt; Who you going to tell? &gt;&gt; You going to tell somebody &gt;&gt; who you going to tell? &gt;&gt; Going to tell somebody. &gt;&gt; Who you going to tell? &gt;&gt; You going to tell somebody? &gt;&gt; Who you going to tell? &gt;&gt; Tell somebody.

[music] Oh, we love you. We love you. We love you. [music] Let me see you shoot. Amen. Go tell it on a mountain. And after you tell it on a mountain, tell it on Rosco Hill that Jesus Christ It's born. &gt;&gt; They don't want it. We will have it. Oh my. The greatest time of the year. There is no greater time. This is the only time where a Muslim will bow before the present king. This is the only time that the Jews will close their shops and say going to tell it on the mountain. This is the only time that our tabernacle is not drawn to a Christmas tree, but they chased to the tree of life. Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills. And I say I say everywhere. This is the greatest time of the year when kings get born. &gt;&gt; They get born in palaces. Beautiful garments. That's when kings get born. But this time when a king of king is born is not born in a palace. He's born in a stable. Because he [music] that was rich became poor so that we that poor can become rich. The greatest time of the year. Oh, praise God. So that's why we're going to tell it to the mountains. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you tell it to the mountain, it echoes back. Your voice come back to you that Jesus Christ is born. We don't care when he was born, what month he was born, as long as he was born. Emanuel, God with us. A star led them to the birth of Jesus. They followed the star. The challen wise men follow the star and the star took them to Jesus. Our day, the seventh star took the wise virgins. The wise virgins. I can't hear you. the wine virgin to where Jesus Christ is born. Amen. That's why I go tell it on a mountain over the hills over Edgar Hill Soul Hill. The hills in Bloomington, the hills in Cape Town, the hills in Victoria, the hills in Johannesburg, the hills in Upton, the hills in Abodine, the hills in King Williamstown, the hills in the Cape Province. We can tell it on every hill that Jesus is born. That's why you need to be born again. And to be born again, you need the spirit of God. So Jesus Christ is born. Go tell it on the mountain. And when you tell it on the mountain, let the bride receive her king. Are you ready to receive your king? Let the bride receive a king. For he has come and is born in the joyful atmosphere of El Tabernacle. And when the magi saw him, they were full of joy and they opened their treasures. After opening their treasures, [music] then only they open gold, frankincense and myrr. And they say the gold they brought for ordinary king is more than 5 million rand dollars. And all the gifts that they brought was over a billion rand. When that boy was born, he was born a billionaire. And when Edgar Osco is born, I possess [music] everything BECAUSE WHY? I CAN tell it on the mountain. Hallelujah. Oh, Christmas is a time of giving. We all give and we receive gifts. That's Christmas time when you receive gifts and you give gifts. But what gift did we bring this morning? We need to give him something, too. Hey, what game did we play? [music] This Christmas we give him our gift. What is our gift? The thing that he appreciates. Watch that. Your body, your soul, and your spirit. You give as a living testimony that you went to tell it on the mountain. Your body, your soul, and your spirit. Three things you're giving him. And the magi gave him three things. gold, frankincense, [music] and myrr. But all three things is something from above, not something from below. So go and tell it on the mountain. Why I'm finishing off? Why, children? Why? Why must we tell it on the mountain? Why? Because Christmas is to do with the heart, the soul. What's Christmas? Christmas is all in the heart. Christmas is not in the Christmas tree. Christmas is not in the snow. Christmas is not with Santa Claus. Christmas is not with the gifts. [music] Christmas is not with choir practicing. Christmas is all in the heart, your body, your soul. Are you ready to give him your gift? [music] Then if you're ready to give him that gift, your pastor is telling you, "Happy Christmas. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; God bless you as we going to tell it one more time on the mountain. [music] &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Everywhere. [music] &gt;&gt; Man, how do we start the convention? [music] &gt;&gt; We're going to tell it.

[applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Good morning everyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'd like to welcome you all. Although we have been welcomed at the beginning of the service. But we thank the Lord that El Tabernacle &gt;&gt; is not at Bloomfentine or in Estras or in Cape [music] Town. El Tabernacle is at the convention center. I rode in this morning and I saw the sign at the gate and the name is Convention Center. There is no church that has that name, Convention Center. We've come to adore him because the Christ is in our midst. &gt;&gt; Do you believe he's here? &gt;&gt; We've come to adore him. There there's no place this morning Wherever you can go that they adore the Christ like here in El Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; El Tabernacle knows how to entertain, worship, and adore him. And how do we know he's here? Wherever Jesus is, there's a little noise [music] in Tabernacle Convention Center. There's a lot of noise. So let's just give Jesus King gone a shabbak this morning. [music] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you the one next to you can't hear you. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; We received the greatest gift. There is no greater gift that could ever hit the globe, but it hit El Tabernacle. the greatest gift. He's here in our midst. [music] He has come down to deliver his people. Amen. So on behalf of my father the apostle the god that has come down in that body we wish you merry Christmas everyone in our midst this morning it's Christmas in our tabernacle Cool. not in the message in El Tabernacle this morning. [cheering] It's Christmas. And I heard the apostles say, "There's wise virgins here." And wherever they are, &gt;&gt; because they carry the oil, we have come. All of us. All of us. We have come. Herod asks why are you here? They say we have come to worship him. Why are you here all the way on the road? We have come as the wise virgins [music] to worship him. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; We want to thank God's apostle for this convention. We want to thank him that we we all made it. &gt;&gt; When we thought we had a busy year with a man of God preaching almost every week for us, we thought the year's over, but we forgot there's still Christmas. The year is not over yet. The service is not over yet. We still coming back on Saturday because the year is not over yet. It's Christmas. [music] The apostle went over and above to give us the best meal for today and for the convention. Why are we here? Because there's a man that wants us to know it's Christmas. Sister Abigail said the meat is already cooked. This good meat we're going to eat is already cooked. So the food is waiting for us. But we still need to give another Shabbach to the Lord and realize it's Christmas. Amen. We want to thank everybody for the birthday wishes. Brother Katiso, are you here? Where is it? Amen. There. Happy birthday, God. Man from the apostle from El Tabernacle. God bless you. We are happy you in our church. Amen. Stay as sweet as you are. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Then the apostle asked brother Joe, the preacher of Bloomfentine, the apostle said he wants to announce it and I'm going to announce it. He has special gifts that he sells &gt;&gt; and the apostle was so appreciative of that gift. &gt;&gt; So if you see brother Joe, get the gift from him because it's a nice gift. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to have church. Though there be one today, but we're going to have a week full of church. It's convention. And I want to be of them, brother Malcolm. That says I was at the whole convention. &gt;&gt; Amen. When wherever the apostle is, there was a convention. &gt;&gt; Since I know myself in El Tabernacle, I was in a convention. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; So be welcomed. Merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; We waited long for this week. I could see you were under expectation but the services has started. [applause] And in closing, I would like to say to the Jews, a son was born. According to the apostle, if you know, but to El Tabernacle, a son is given. Jesus came down and he lifted me up. So, are we going to kiss the sun? the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The greatest thing that there is. May God bless you, El Tabernacle. Enjoy the fellowship. Enjoy the convention. Enjoy this [music] day. It has started. And may you be merry. Don't be sad. Put a smile on your face and be married. We have God with us. That's why we are here to worship him. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; May God bless you. We can't have all these things if God is not with us. And if you don't believe the man, believe [music] the works. We can't even write down what happened this year. But we believe that if the works [music] testify who is in our midst, let's give the Lord a shabbak. [music] God bless you. And merry Christmas. [music] Amen. You still appreciate our precious pastor Jonathan. Amen. Would love to call up the tithes and the offerings. If the Ashes can just place the tithes if you can remain standing.
