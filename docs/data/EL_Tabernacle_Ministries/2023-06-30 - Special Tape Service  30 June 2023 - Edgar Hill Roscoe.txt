TRANSCRIPT
========================================
walk in the light few things full light [Music] [Music] Shine On all around me by day by night Jesus the light of the world father we glad to call you father thank you that we could gather her like this Lord and thank you for sending light it's good to find the way but oh God if the way hasn't got light then we'll get lost Lord you might walk over onto the sidewalk or we might trip over some cobblestones but thank you for the light that's on this way the pull off fire the Morning Star that could lead us through Lord we pray this morning as we come to eat of your hand Lord William we need you we need some more fuel to tip us up just to get out of here Lord therefore we ask of you God to come and help us here The Invasion is on people is opening up now to get baptized with the nicolaitan spirit there is also a bride that's opening up to be invaded from the astronaut of Heaven May invade us Lord we ask these Mercies not that we're Worthy but you're the worthy one this morning I give myself into your hand and report for service I give you my gift Lord may you take that gift and work with it pull me aside and use my gift I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ because what good is a gift if I can't get out of the way for you to lose that gift then we can say shine all around us by day and by night I hand this meeting into your hands may your undertake for us amen and amen if you have your Bibles with you Booker Daniel 9. 21 down to verse 24. you also was speaking in prayer while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in division at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touch me about the time of the evening oblation right at the evening time he touched me while I was speaking in prayer Gabriel flew in while we speak about Daniel May Gabriel not drop down here because he can only announce what's going to take place but let Michael drop down here because he can transform and deliver we already had the announcement we already heard from Genesis 18 Elohim Michael Gabriel Gabriel already announced but we need Michael the angel to deliver us give us strength help us write about the evening time you while I was speaking in prayer I like that and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding at the beginning of thy supplication the Commandments came forth and I come to show thee but Thou Art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and and considered a vision it's quite something Daniel a Jew Joseph a jewel Gabriel said to them but Michael can go both ways Jill and Gentile Raphael the angel stand on the backside drop down through the anointing of the elders healed sister ghani they are here brother Branham calls him the angel of healing the one that stirs the water an ear drop in there and you get healed by that angel at the beginning of thy supplication at the beginning of your prayers when you're laid in front of me the Commandment came forth and I have come to show thee but Thou Art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to do what Point number one to finish transgression Point number two to make make an end of sins Point number three and to make reconciliation [Music] for iniquity Point number four and to bring in Everlasting righteousness Hallelujah Point number five and to seal up the vision and the prophecy Point number six and to anoint for the last time the most holy the six-fold purpose that's why I said you cannot preach purpose unless you preach a mind and when you preach mind you cannot have mind unless you have a prophet therefore the prophet could say six fold purpose and then he comes back in a seal book everything God has three fold purpose and he comes after the seal book and he preached the threefold purpose and they stealing the messages but that same message on purpose they preach they're going to stand in front of God and give an account what they've done with their message brother Branham reaches and the gold mines and the diamond mines of South Africa he means more to us than anything else so we thank him and we praise him what a wonderful savior is he don't you love him this morning now it's been preached The Invasion it has come into the newspaper and that's a rock newspaper and brother Branham says this if a man preaches and God comes behind it like that then it was not the man it was God [Music] [Applause] so we must have heard the voice of God in this couple of months that has elapsed now I can only come and fulfill my purpose and fulfill what God sent me to do and I cannot vouch for anybody else but even if I try to do something else I can't because every man of God is in prison like Paul being a prisoner of Christ we can only do what God has ordained us to do on this mother earth nothing more nothing less and we want to finish the course we one till to get to the bottom and that we could turn around and say we didn't shun to declare all the Praises of God all the councils of God before we leave this world behind and it's so very soon that we're going to go home and we're going to do everything in our power and you see how God is Healing The Sick we had another and announce of last week and Saturday the young sister fullness and told us in Cape Town how are the people is getting healed and I what I'd done was after we had the prayer line I came behind I says now some of you still have the pain and you still feel sick and all that I said but after a while the Holy Ghost will visit you one by one by your house I said the I said the angel of the Lord will visit you one by one at your homes and uh for this last three weeks the testimonies are coming in and last week and Saturday nights sister back at home when we just came back from the um uh uh combined or was it Sunday one of the two days but it was just after we made that announcement and then she told my wife please tell brother roscom that we stole getting in testimonies of the healing power of almighty God psalm very sure something going on we're not just coming to church and sit around the Supernatural is all around you and you supposed to be in desperation amen and um Shiva spoke about the message says even I a lot of churches outside is buying the message that I preached down there pain and um we really glad for what God is doing no I had quite a few invitations to go out this year but as we see such a lot of things are happening I don't feel really or maybe if God speaks to my heart I might move but as far as my mind is concerned because my heart can only do what my mind says and uh as far as my mind is concerned I'd like to stay around and just see a couple of months left and get behind me so I can feel okay because [Music] um everything is ready everything is planned and purpose and on the verge of breaking forth so we really thank God that we posted my concern goes a lot to the young people I am concerned about him and I want you to get the Holy Ghost because if you're not going to get the Seal of God you are not going to stand repentance is all right it's good to repent every day please but the conversion is the thing the Holy Ghost is the thing it's good to be baptized but friends you can be saved and yet not converted and conversion only comes by a baptism so we pray that God would invade you as brother Lenny or Somebody Prayed with the Holy Ghost then I'll feel good then you can go to as many sessions you want to go you can smoke as many cigarettes you want to smoke you can go with any wealthy friend as much as you want to go I feel safe because you're gonna run away there the Holy Ghost is not going to keep you in one of those places so before visiting those places and having a worldly friend get the Holy Ghost and once you have the Holy Ghost then you can do what you want to do all that I know that you seal till the day of your Redemption so my work here is to give you the Holy Ghost God can't do anything in the interval unless he sealed the 144. with the same baptism that's here now I'm glad that God has given me one thing in this life to give out the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm satisfied and when the young people has the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you can touch one another I want to see if you will be able to go like because the Holy Ghost is a counter it can't smoke it can't drink [Applause] it can't touch a woman it can't touch a man it's a counter can't look at television that's the reason the people fear it can't put the see-through blouse on can't put a short dress on can't have bob hair cut hair but I like the sconther amen so let's get the Holy Ghost a lot of things are going on a lot of things is going past many people but God has been good to us their eyes is open about a year and a half ago we preached when money fails many thought it was just a good message many thought it was just a time to pass by in the Church of God but it was prophecy we told you when you start seeing things like that look up your Redemption is drawing now and those other things that we're watching because brother Branham told us to watch it those are the things that we underline because brother Branham says underline it [Music] and just a couple of weeks ago in Time Magazine how low can it go how low is the dollar and I told you when I preached and I came back from the states last year and I told you about the book there economical earthquake that this guy said that you would only going to America is only going to have two years and it's not even two years yet and she's plunging and when she goes money fails right around the world I looked at how the Jesuits worked out the whole thing what has the dollar got to do with the Yen and with her Benchmark and with the Rand and with the power what what I mean what but it shows you there's power behind the monetary system and the German's money is one of the strongest in Durham Japanese yen is the strongest but they say if this still goes down further than they their money that's so strong will have to go down as well when the dollar goes the whole world goes for each two years ago this day the scripture of Genesis is fulfilled in front of your very eyes [Applause] where Joseph says in Genesis and money fails now when money fails then also on the other side the perfect man is just about to be birthed [Applause] and when the perfect man gets birth then Perfection hits the pyramid then they cannot be made perfect unless we hit perfection then our Perfection raises the Dead 30 40 days of Revival in the sixth time mention where no eye natural eye sees it but our eyes because we'll see our loved ones 30 40 days Revival then we'll fly away in the morning then the interval breaks [Applause] praise God our ministry is not like the other Ministries this is something different here we don't want to say that but it's the truth Suleiman we took her out last night and she said something that really shook my wife and myself and I won't mention some of the sisters that she mentioned and down in Cape Town whenever I go down there and they said man we don't want to listen to anybody but when brother Roscoe come we want to be there because we're going to get something and she turned around she says yeah I just wish that you don't put too much emphasis on the man to let the man fall because we realize that God gave that man something but the tower is too late for any falling it can only be a rapture [Applause] so Wednesday night we're gonna play again when money fails to you bring your mind into rapturing faith and if I catch your mind I don't care about the perfect man character forget you here I've got you all the other things will be added then this alone was a message I Can Say Goodbye [Music] but we still have until six o'clock tonight [Applause] I'm so happy we'll walk in the light oh such a beautiful life what a beautiful light I want to do everything to stay in this light amen so may God just take the gift this morning and do whatever he wants to do with the gift pull the gift this way pull it that way Lord I'm reporting for service each one of us has a gift amen so I'm not gonna put my gift in a ground there but nobody know about it and when the Harvest man comes back I want to know what I've done with my gift the Lord I have buried it no when he comes back I want to produce much fruit amen brother Brahm says if a church don't grow spiritually and naturally within three years or a Ministry don't produce naturally and spiritually in three years God is not with administering so we'll walk in the light amen it's a beautiful light praise God and the last thing I would like to say is um we're waiting for the cutout from Brother Stafford about a certain rock group that's here and they telling the guy not to leave in the interval don't live in the interval now I want to tell you don't you want to try and live in the interval because it's only the foolish virgins that lives in the interval [Music] [Applause] so this message is also in the newspaper saying something don't live in the interval now all these things how can the mind take it It could only be God that's all that's what I would like to bring to your mind to do it to do with God and nothing else amen and I'm so glad that I'm to do with him Hallelujah the angel where they swept back way praise God stand there Amen in authority follow the looking down where is my pride Satan I am here now amen nothing you can do

Oscar got a problem here I got a problem there amen I don't know if I got the Holy Ghost because I do this wrong and do that wrong that's nothing that's just a leak you're just losing a little Holy Ghost but you've got a Holy Ghost [Applause] and one day in zush Ministry God will show us where to catch up deadly [Applause] and you will sit there and your leak will be patched up and you will wonder where is this problem all the time ahead it'll be gone [Applause] amen so hold on not Moses bride [Music] [Applause] the Chariots are coming the combines are coming amen now there's going to be
