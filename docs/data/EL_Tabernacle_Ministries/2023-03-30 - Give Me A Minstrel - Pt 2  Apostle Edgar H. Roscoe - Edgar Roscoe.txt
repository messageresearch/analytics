========================================
let us throw it father I pray that you'd give me Spirits spoken words tonight not only words but Spirit spoken words I pray as I come with earnesty in my heart that you would first forgive me in my trespasses forgive me my sin forgive me where I failed you and then Lord let the minstrel play and may the hand of God more I hand this meeting into your hands in Jesus name amen [Music] give me a monstrum [Applause] you are in a constant battle to be a Christian is a battle it's a fight you have to fight you must fight you can't love love love love love love love love love love love love love You're Gonna Lose your possession [Applause] there's a Time To Love and there's a Time to Kill there's a time to plant and the time to rip up amen and in the time of trouble it's not the time of law in the time of trouble it's a time of fighting in the time of trouble you're gonna draw your sword and say ways that Goliath can you say it with me can you say it with me are you keeping it are you keeping it I'll pass to that they try to give David another way to fight the battle their way that armor and all that was not able to find and David says no no take these things away I have a way to fight don't change your ways to fight the first time you overcame him used that same way if you use a slingshot keep the sling soft Hallelujah Hallelujah if you use bad keep on praying [Applause] don't change the weapon [Applause]
