TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] let's continue singing it shine on he is the light of the world [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah Hall amen let us pray our heavenly father it is in the name of Jesus that we come to you this morning you know how we feel inside this morning Hallelujah and know God all that we want to be is messengers of you all that we want to be Lord is to send Souls into your kingdom all that we want to say and sing is I'll work till Jesus come I pray oh God that you give us more encouragement you said that you put your strength in them may you put strength in US Lord to fulfill our purpose on the earth I give this meeting into your hands Lord and I ask of you that you will draw strength out of it you that knows our motives and our objectives and you that try it and judge it Lord we can say that you know our motives and objectives may you bless the church as we try to help them we're not here to break them down we here to bold the Church of God [Applause] [Music] I can only do what you want me to do Lord what I'm SED for May you continually be with us through this meeting in jesus' name amen and amen praise God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Daniel Amen if you have your Bibles with you let's turn to the book of Hebrews the book of Hebrews that St Paul wrote because he was a Hebrew of Hebrews touching the Lord he was a Pharisee of Pharisees touching the the dispensation of Grace he was the first and foremost messenger of God touching the writings of the New Testament he wrote them all and everybody had to pattern after him because he says if an angel come from heaven and say anything contrary to what I I say let him be a [Music] curse Hebrews the book of Hebrews the 12th chapter reading the 16th and the 17th verse 16th and 17th verse L there be any fornicators a profane person as Esau who for one morcel of meat sold his birth right for you know how that afterwards after he sold out when he would have inherit the blessing he was supposed to inherit the blessing he was supposed to have been in the kingdom of God he was supposed to make it for heaven but he sold out gave it away didn't want it rejected it played around with it made a fool of it listen to what the word of God says inherited the blessing he was rejected even if he was supposed to have the blessing even if it was he was the son of a prophet even if he was in the lineage of many righteous man even if he was very religious he was rejected he was rejected for he found no place of repentance there was no place found for repentance it's all right no place found for repentance listen to the next line though he sought it carefully with tears carefully took his time went through his life line by line do by dot comma by comma as he took stock of his life and not only checking it but checking it with tears in his eyes maybe many a prayer went up at that moment of his distress and Gloom and being away from God and felt no touch from God anymore rejected it then what happened he cried he checked himself out he was still religious he still believed that his father was a prophet so believing brother Brenham is a prophet and it's your father if you do not live the life you go gone you gone God has no grandchildren the prophet says being in this message and think you are right and live any type of a life don't think that you are right seeking a place of repentance although we sought it carefully with tears cannot play with God God wants you to keep sincerity and fight on my son Jude preached not so long ago Don't Stop Don't Stop seeking it with tears many preachers think that when a man cries God will give him an opportunity to come back he didn't do it with Esau you cry while the grace of God is upon you then God wipes it away but when you cross the line you can cry until the cows come home you would don't listen to you let us bow our heads father what is scripture many and many Ministers of today Lord they'll be shaken when they see somebody cry at the altar like Esau but oh God once they cross that line nothing nothing nothing nothing will help them entering into the joys of the Lord I do pray that this morning Father that the efforts that's going to be put into this meeting Lord will be met after this meeting is over I do pray for the young people I do pray oh God that you'll speak to them I pray oh God that you would he would reveal to them the sincerity of this meeting I ask Lord that I cannot do anything unless you come you are the one that has called this meeting let results Blossom from the meeting father I give this meeting into your hands as I also after I went in and I saw this I was troubled in my soul lord I ask for grace and I ask Lord that I wouldn't play the fool with you that I would be sincere with the things of God H that I wouldn't shed tears when it's too late and the words will be UT uttered Lord too late too late too late for Tears answer prayer as I give this meeting into your hands Lord in jesus' name amen and amen you may be seated I greet everyone in the precious name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I I need your prayer to go through this meeting I feel tired I being at the funeral yesterday and uh would like to just B heads for the crossing over brother Samson and sister lyy and Coy i' would have Lov to be there but I'm just a human being I can't be all over I hardly have enough time for myself I do not know when last did I have a holiday I can't recall having a holiday I do not know when last so I ask you to pray for me I caught a little cold after preaching yesterday but I'm sure God will lead me through yet let us just bow our heads just for a little while for the two saints that has crossed over amen thank you want to thank God for their lives that was before us and the race is over as I said yesterday in mapani they had a dream many of us has dreams our dreams is actually what brings us to our purpose your dream is to be a millionaire that's fine politician that's fine we want our dreams to be on the Lord Jesus Christ if your dreams is on money if your dreams is on woman if your dreams is on the the world somebody will wake you up that great re Resurrection morning you'll be woken up but if your dream is on the Lord Jesus Christ then please don't wake me up I would like to Dream [Applause] On I've heard the other day that uh somebody said I preached on down the horizontal rainbow and uh that Mr Rosco uh doesn't care what he says when he's behind the poopit and speak about sex and stuff like that no I don't care and I don't apologize [Applause] [Music] if your pastor has a wishbone and cannot say those things then let him have a wishbone but I want to tell you I have a backbone and I'll say it again and again and [Applause] again I'd like to say that uh the young people years these things in school and you still want to speak about stalks bringing babies and stuff like that they know the hard facts and that's the reason I preach the hard facts I put it down without rubber gloves brother Brenham had to put it down and speak and it was bad in those times for saying those things that brother Brenham said when he spoke about the hum's underneath clothing is showing and it's a disgrace it was hard for him to say because nobody ever said it but we're living in another age that's worse than brother Bron's age this is worse and now I don't say that the humans underneath clothing is showing I said the penties are showing it's exactly what brother brandham says just brother BR couldn't say the way I say it because this is the age that needs the thing to be said [Applause] amen and if you not call Pastor to say it then don't say it you'll cause a lot of stumbling when you say it but when I say it it cause repentance wherever I preach that message fth came up and people [Applause] [Music] repented I preached that message down in Zimbabwe buo brother Beck walk up to me he says nobody can ever preach that the way you do cuz you have a gift to do it now if you don't have the gift to do it then shut up I'll do it for you years ago brother Coleman preached and in between his preaching he says there that woman sits with the split legs open and most of the ministers came down on him and I met him afterwards he says I do not know what's wrong with the ministers said God says he says uh do they read brother brandom and those guys didn't even know that was a quote can you imagine brother brandham how many years is ago brother Renee 30 some years that brother Rena spoke about a man stucking his fath in the woman and the woman is a a sexual garbage can 30 somewhat years ago and you want to play around Mister amen if you can't preach it get out of the poopet get somebody that will say it and preach it you know they they tried all the years to have something against me but every time they have something it actually boosts me [Music] [Applause] today I'm going to preach something that I think that ministers wouldn't like ministers would U would say how could he do a thing like this how could he show things like this in his church but again I would like to tell you that when I feel inspired of God then I do what God tells me and I'm going to go into things today that is mindboggling and I'm here to try and help my young people as I was told not long ago in the week and before that that somebody said you know there's a lot of virgins in Edgar Rosco's church so you don't have to tell me I know that because that's what I preach I tried to keep them clean and now even the world says he has a of Virgin sitting here so my young sister you think that nobody's watching you and you think that maybe you do not have a boyriend now they they they there's no eyes on you the eyes of the world is on you and they know who you are so keep yourself clean keep yourself clean don't let Devil's coming in and and and and wants to disrupt you and and the devil tells nobody's looking at you and that's why you don't have a boyfriend your boyfriend is on the way and when he's on the way he's going to appreciate you so much that you so you would like to be just around [Applause] you and it's funny uh that somebody phoned me I would not call her name phoned me and told me this but son Saturday after I preach I told my wife you know while I was preaching I looked around the congregation I saw so many virgins I said lovey I feel like fighting [Applause] on and may Lucifer know it may the hounds of Hell know it as long as I'm behind this Pulpit I'll preach Holiness like no man in the pipo ministry will preach it I will preach it with gloves of my hands rugged as rugged can be [Applause] and don't let anybody else tell you anything I am sent to help you I am sent to help [Applause] you and what I'm going to preach might not look so good to other people but it's good to me and they will say well how could brother Ros could do a thing like that but I would like to tell you that um brother Brenham one time was on the hunting trip and he walked and the angel of the Lord told him pick up that cigarette box and he said Lord I I never touch those things he says pick it up that's your message for Sunday a cigarette box and I want to tell you my brother and my pastor friend and preachers I'm picking up my cigarette box this morning and bringing out my message this morning Peter was told when he saw a vision of all the creeping things that the Jews was not supposed to eat and the voice told him eat kill and eat and he says I'm never at Haram before the angel told him listen you what I may don't call it haram slay and [Applause] eat so what I'm going to be busy with you do not call it by Any Other [Applause] Name just say that God showed him something that I never saw be honest once in your [Applause] life I must fulfill my purpose and I must come to make sense to the spoken word of William Brenan as he has [Applause] said in the spoken word that men will follow me in birth pains to make sense to the word and I must fulfill my purpose and so far I'm pleased I can see that I'm fulfilling my purpose what's in my heart I can see it's being fulfilled so I'd like to entitle this message crossing the line crossing the the line don't ever cross the line you'll feel religious you'll still feel that you're in the message you'll still go to church you'll still pray you'll weep you'll feel an anointing but it'll be on the outer cord but you have crossed the line God don't even listen to you crossing the line crossing the line means the place where something like a road a roadway or a Waterway or a line maybe crossed that's what crossing the line means lines get C gets drawn to determine borders that line is is is being drawn to show you this side is that country this side is this country anything that goes over that line is in trouble you are an alien when you come from this side and cross the line on the other side without papers you're an alien in that country God I mean the the the the governments of that country has all the right to put you into ceration and if they feel like throwing the key away they can because you cross the line crossing the line means that you're in somebody else's territory and you broke laws young people don't cross the line don't think that you can go on and on and on and God will just sit there and smile and say nothing and God will Pat you on your shoulder because he wants you to be saved God don't need you you need him could we have that first slide crossing the line normally you have a sign a skeleton or a skeleton's head and they said don't come into this terate and there's a skeleton's head there it means if you cross the line and there's a skeleton's head there then it means that you are going to become like a skeleton you are going to be severed apart you are going to be like the skeleton's head that's what a notice actually means and crossing the line could mean that your mortal life comes to an end crossing the line will make you a skeleton's head normally when they have a sign on the on the gate beware the dogs they have the same head there with a cross on there don't enter into this territory because he has vicious dogs here dogs that will ravage you dogs that will make you look like a skeleton dogs that's put there for one purpose is to protect the territory and everybody that passes the line that dog has the right to sever and tear him apart that's true crossing the line the logistics of that sign is don't cross that line into this territory you'll be SED apart I have visited most of the big waterfalls of the world most of them I visited all the big ones all the notable ones all the great waterfalls of the world I seen them all and brother and sister don't look at Rufus amen you watch me you look at that that that waterfalls falling and I seen them all over the world I visited them I saw Niagra Falls on the border of the states in Canada big water fall I saw the Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe the biggest I mean the deepest waterfall in the world and I saw the aasha waterfalls in Brazil the biggest of them all I saw all those waterfalls all over and on that waterfalls there is a line drawn and that line especially at Niagara Falls that line is called the line of no return it means if you cross that line there is no way back it means that when you have penetrated that line amen the current is so immense the drag is so uh so mighty that there is no way that you can come back because the current just pulls you and pulls you you can't swim back because you've crossed the line of no return there is no return when you cross that line and that current just takes you into the cataracts below and brother Bram says in pmma Vision Jeffersonville Indiana 1969 what it will be to know that you set in meetings and heard that you you should get right with God uh and I hope that this meeting is a meeting like this that you will get right with God uh amen and receive the Holy Ghost and a and a defying soul to hear that voice speak out in that meeting that you set in and heard the judgments of God preach and refuse it the Great Falls that's just below you the great cataracts that'll take you to your Eternal Doom way down in that cataracts that's when you come down the waterfall and you fall into that cataracts below amen he types it with eternal damnation when you cross the line of no return uh and the drag takes you uh and the current takes you and it throws you right down in the cataracts below and what happens when you hit the cataracts below it takes your soul right down in condemnation and eternal Doom he says voices of many Waters forth patronage of him voice of many Waters how you going to do it when it's recorded in glory when The Voice tonight is recorded uh when The Voice this morning is recorded your voice is recorded your thoughts are recorded as a man think it in his heart so is he notice your voice is louder in heaven than your uh I mean your thoughts is louder in heaven than your voice is on the earth certainly it is God knows the thoughts intense of heart he knows all about it don't cross the line into the currents of hell then not even my preaching will be able to save you and not even the Holy Ghost in L Tabernacle as it moveed from bench to bench will ever save you because you're heading down for the cataracts below where it takes your soul into Eternal damnation when you hear the voice of many Waters is a voice of many gods and Men of God that has the voice of almighty God when you hear that voice voice is hard and not your heart El Tabernacle amen never never before amen did you hear the voice of God so vividly declared to you as this church has heard it amen and I want to tell you don't cross this voice uh don't go over onto the other side in this voice amen you rather fulfill this voice uh and don't cross the line [Applause] down at the cataracts below as your soul gets dragged to Hell somebody says yes brother Ros shouldn't we be more positive and preach I preach positive most of my messages is positive but you cannot only uh preach positive you have to have a negative and a positive to let the light go on amen there's make Believers and unbelievers and Believers in the church you have to preach to them all uh amen there sers that needs repentance uh and you need to show them if you cross that line uh it's a line of no return uh and brother there's a line drawn for every blood watch child of the Living God uh there's a line drawn a bloodline a Jesus line a token line and brother I want to welcome you to cross that that line and you'll never return Hallelujah to the things of the world you'll be saved saved and saved uh yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sir the prophet crossed a line one time where a a man just the day before crossed that line and Abu came and slaughtered the man because he crossed the line he went into a territory that he was not supposed to have gone in and do you know I don't read nowhere that brother Brenham says that the authorities of the SPCA came and killed that bull no he penetrated the Bull's territory and he knew the consequences when you cross the line you know the consequences you know what's heading your way you know which way you're going and God has no apologies then you have to face the [Applause] music crossing the line and the next day brother Brenham didn't mean anything and he crossed the line and then that guy made himself ready for his second convict him but love saved him hallah love dropped out and love spoke to the bull and laugh told the bull listen here I was on my way to a certain brother to to to pray for him because the god that made you made me look how brother Brenham spoke to that murderous Bull and that bull just looked at brother Brenham and that bull deciphered what brother Brandon was saying and that bull says oh you're going to pray for a certain brother so you're loving for others okay go your way when you love for others even Bulls St come near you amen that's eternal life [Applause] thank you brother Rufus amen crossing the line you can't come back when you cross the line whether you cross the line of the blood of Jesus Christ you go so deep in that blood then you even sing the song no turning back no turning back amen you can't can't go back anymore because you have crossed the line into holy territory you would never want to come into the land of sin no more you're living in a Land of peace peace a wonderful peace uh coming down from the Savior above amen hallelujah amen God also has a line of no return and that's the blood of Jesus Christ don't let us cross that line young people this meeting is for you this morning amen don't cross that line of No Return by blaspheming the Holy Ghost is a line of no return rejecting the manifestation of the word to love the word is a line of no return uh turn your head and heart away from God uh then God turns his mind and heart away from you it's a line of no return amen put something between you and God Amen and make an idol of it that's the line of no return uh close your of compassion towards all that's called God Amen that's the line of no return you keep on sinning freely amen you War but you go on H that's the line of no return God won't give you another chance amen as long as eternity Rings Amen in this Dreadful thing this is what happens when you cross the line I wish I could let all you read it because because I've got a lot to say I'll just quote it uh Proverbs 1:24 because I have called and he refused I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but you have set at not all my counsels and who do and who none of my reprove I will also laugh your Calamity I will mock when your fear cometh when your fear cometh as destruction and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you then shall they call upon me but I will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me help us Lord when I called you you didn't want to come when I stretch my hand out to you I want to save you you refuse my head now when your Destruction come when you start to seek me with tears like Esau I had my hand out for Esau amen I tried my best for Esau but he turned my hand down he looked at a mortal little morcel of food and he rejected my amazing hand my hand of Grace he rejected it and now he rejected my hand of Grace I will reject him too he will seek me amen at the altar he will cry at the altar he'll call upon my name at the altar you'll say Lord where are you and I will turn my back against you because you didn't want to come when I called you now that you call me you won't find me why cuz you crossed the line you mean Esau born in the message yes you mean Esau with such a spiritual mother a Praying Mother yes you mean Esau that knew the Torah the spoken word for his day yes I reject him I reject him and when he calls I will not answer him why do Esau cross the line of no return brother brandham says when he was in hell he cried for God and the was was no God he prayed and he he repented but there was no God what was God showing him showing him that thus is the line of no return you my Prophet going tell them never to come to this place never never never never never come to this place cuz when you cross the line now you see the place now you want to turn back to the right place but the devil cannot leave you he says in Isaiah I am the one that do not open my prison doors there is no way of an escape crossing the line young people don't play around with god oh many and many didn't understand when I said you young boys that goes out and do whatever you want to do set it home why because I don't want your children to cross the line don't want them to sit you and go on and go on and go on and go on until they cannot come back anymore let them sit at home and reason it out is this better than hell is the church better than belir they have to decide but as for me in my house we'll serve the Lord when they call me I would not come I will laugh at that imagine God laughing imagine you hurt him so much that he feels so distressed that he laughs at you at your day of Calamity I told you some time ago that people wouldn't come on a Wednesday night to the meeting and afterwards they'll come maybe they stay out of this meeting one Wednesday the next Wednesday they in the meeting two Wednesdays they skip the third meeting they are there and not long they start on Sundays they don't come to Sundays I want to tell you beware that you do not cross the line and you're going to cry to be here and you'll cry and feel the Holy Ghost but God has rejected you you do not play around with God play around with your mother play around with your father play around with your friends but don't play around with the word of God God will God will thus sayth the Lord cut you [Applause] off cross the line of no return there's no way back and now I want to show you a striking thing young people I want to show you a striking thing this will happen to many of the young people that don't listen to this voice and the voices of that fivefold Ministry this is what's going to happen you go after this you want this this is the end thing amen I want this because my friends got it amen and because the whole the whole schools got it I feel like like an outcast you rather be an outcast but an incast in heaven outcast on the earth I want to be I do not want to be conformed to the things of the world I want to be right with almighty [Applause] God and now for the young people let us go Daniel you know of Elvis wle as the artist proclaim the king of rock and roll but what you're about to see is the side of this legendary singer which is on virtually unexplored join me as we discover generous spiritual man as revealed by those who knew him well and knew well his love of gospel music [Music] amaz in all likelihood gospel was the first music that Elvis heard the surviving child of twins born to Vernon and Gladis Presley Elvis entered the world in Humble circumstances he never laed for Love from his father he learned the value of heart Elvis Presley a twin Elvis Presley born with a brother Elvis Presley a gospel singer Elvis Presley a singer with talent but a twin what do you mean by TS Pastor Roso Cain and Abel Abel died Cain lived Elva's brother died and he lived twins what twins Pastor Rosco Jacob and Esau twins one evil one good one in the church Elvis Presley singing he touched me when did God touch Folk when did God ever work with f and young people would go after theck and R Kings and sell their births to them they would connect up with a man's name that's called Evil Al ver take the the L out behind the E and put it at the back it's evil and he sang a song I'm evil I'm evil and all that our young people see is to go with a mob and follow this monster I pull no punches and it's here where you lose your virgins the Devil comes in with music and he steals the virgins the Devil comes in with music and he prings the drugs and the cigarettes and the nice time and all that the young people do is to follow it but let us go on T Cain and AEL his mother to whom he was intensely devoted he gained a foundation of faith and a love for gospel music okay Daniel gospel music he loves singing gospel music a devil well I thought that the devil is Antichrist no the Bible says the devil believes even he sings great Musical songs doesn't mean that the man is saved it doesn't mean that the man is right with God uh it doesn't mean that he comes from Heaven uh no in a million miles no and you young people you go after things like this I don't want to follow him I already made up my mind I'll follow Jesus all the [Applause] way his mother gave him the gospel mother Pentecostal hold it Elvis Presley being baptized baptized in a Pentecostal Church baptized and be called a brother baptized as a child of God and yet he was the Devil Himself how could would I let my children go after men like that and act like them and dress like them and go with them and go to the session halls with things like that I will keep them away they say brother Rosco is il legalist yes you believe it sir I'll be a legalist as long as they don't get that into the church [Applause] don't think that you are baptized you are right don't think that that man that comes into the church and gets baptized he's a [Applause] saint he's so full of the devil Let It Roll Daniel [Music] when did he receive the Holy Ghost stop it did we receive the Holy Ghost we'll see further on he could go right up till the baptism but he could never get the baptism in the Holy Spirit you can receive the word anybody can receive the word anybody can receive the word and be baptized and he never questioned one time the word he even read the word we're going to see later on he read the word but the question was the baptism in the spirit of God brother brandham types him I've got the quotes as Judas scariot and Judas was in the word Judas slept with the prophet Judas was in the message don't tell me you're in the message man it means nothing to the devil the only thing that matters to the devil is when you got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost leads you to the word and the word leads you into the light and the life leads you into shouting and jumping and dancing and shoing and dancing lead you into crying and sighing for the Abomination that's done in the city then the devil shakes [Applause] Let It [Music] Roll he long to be there you long to be there Bright sh they gets baptized not sprinkled we baptized the devil will even baptize himself but not the Holy Ghost [Music] baptism in the soul [Music] real this relationship with his mom was very special he was extremely close to her he was not as close to Vernon his father by any by any means as he was his mother but his mother you know okay his mother a Pentecostal woman his mother took him to a Pentecostal Church his mother a Praying Woman his mother set the pattern for him to never go lost young people El's mother was spiritual your mother is spiritual and don't think that your mother and father is spiritual and they're living the life with Jesus Christ that you're going to be all right and do whatever you want to you'll see what brother Brandon says about this guy I'm only starting we're going to get out here late he extremely close to her he was not as close to Vernon his father as by any by any means as he was his mother but his mother you know she held his hand and took him to church and took him to school walked him to school when he was a child those things he never was always there for him when he needed her it's just something he never forgot and you know he just he never got over her death [Music] I got into conversation with Elvis just it's just a regular General conversation how are you doing I'm doing fine and you and how you hurt from home this kind of thing but he said uh uh you know my mama went to the uh there in Memphis he said went to a Pentecostal Church down there and uh he said went at Pentecostal church he said are you Pentecostal I said well I've attended a Pentecostal Church quite a bit and uh but I said uh I don't you know I've just I've been kind of Baptist Baptist Churches also and uh he said well said uh I tell you what's on my mind he said this Holy Spirit thing you know anything about the Holy Spirit thing I said what you talking about I mean he was just kind of been he was just being Elvis cuz Elvis was so plain he just went straight to the juggler you know straight to the point and he began to talk about he never felt worthy of this Christian or this type of religion his mother had taught him in the church he never felt worthy of the Pentecostal blessing Judas could never get it Elvis couldn't get it he didn't say well I never he says I didn't feel worthy of it young people wake up this is where all the filth started this is the father of all the other rock stars and pop stars it's the father and the father wanted to know about the Holy Ghost I wanted to know how do I know that I've got it and if he you following him and you don't even know what was in the man's heart the man's heart wanted God the man's heart wanted to be a Christian the man's heart wanted to be near God but he crossed the line and God didn't answer him that's why he says I never felt withy made Shak in L Tabernacle this morning Let It Go felt worthy of this Christian or this type of religion his mother had taught him him in the church don't play with the sound just leave it he said how will I get how will I know if I get the Holy Spirit or I have the Holy how do I know and how do I get it does holy ghost thing and he never got it oh elvers elvers if you only knew that was in the ease of man on the earth now that can give you the Holy Ghost that's got connection as brother Brandon says there is man that can give you and lead you into the Holy Ghost I might not be able to give you but I can lead you into [Applause] it and there was a man William brandham that could lead him into it but he wanted to listen to other men that William brandham was the hand of God to draw him away from the line of no r how do I know how do I know I've got it how do I get it and here you said Al Tabernacle you young people your Elvis Presley didn't have the Holy Ghost your Elvis Presley wanted to know how to get it your Elvis Presley that you get mad all want to just one more chance and get the Holy Ghost and yet he doesn't have it and here you sit in the church where the holy spirit is and where you can be saved where you'll never cross the line why don't you listen to this [Applause] preacher how will I get how will I know if I get the Holy Spirit or I have the Holy Spirit of God in Me and uh so I I don't quite know that uh this Baptist preacher don't even know how to get it too and some ministers in this message want to be Baptist they even turn around and says I would rather be a Baptist than a Pentecostal you don't even know what you're talking about sir you are actually saying that you want to be caring the only Eagles that there is is Eagles that's got the holy ghost that knows where to fly don't you know that I don't want to be a Baptist Hallelujah but I want to have the Pentecostal experience amen how would I know if I get the Holy Spirit or I have the Holy Spirit of God in Me and uh so was I I don't quite know that uh I said God has promised us everything and as long as we're faithful to him he'll give us everything we're supposed to have and when we get it we'll know it when we we have what we're supposed to have we'll know it I said I think that's Infinity you're talking about Infinity he said Infinity you're talking if you talk about the Holy Ghost you're talking about Infinity Elvis knew more than a lot of bunch of ministers in this message that has rejected the Holy Ghost because of jumping and shouting if you don't jump and Shout you don't have it sir and I pull no punches that's one of the aspects of the Holy Ghost we have what we're supposed to have we'll know it I said I think that's Infinity you're talking about Infinity he said well I just want is God when you have the Holy Ghost you have God God in you Hallelujah the word and the spirit is God himself not the word the spirit and the word Let It Roll brother so I think that's Infinity you're talking about Infinity he said well I just want my what my mama had my mama had something real good so I kind of thought that was up my mama had something real good we you hear what brother brandham says about his mom all ministers in this message are you going to cross the line for you can never return to the Holy Ghost again oh I don't want the Holy Ghost that's Edgar Rosco's thing that is nothing to do with Edgar Rosco that's Infinity that's God hallelujah and it's for everybody I just want my my mama had my mama had something real good so I I thought that was a a a simple maybe a simple statement from him but a very deep one because he he was trying to get into this thing of he wanted everything it was a deep one not the word everybody knows the Bible but the Holy Ghost is a deep thing amen that even the type of Judas es scariot Elvis Presley knew that the Holy Ghost is a deep thing amen I've dug deep and I've drank strange Waters uh a simple maybe a simple statement from him but a very deep one because he he was trying to get into this thing of he wanted everything he could from God he really loved God he would discuss spiritual ideas with us and it wasn't so much uh what we did it was what happened in the room the at the atmosphere how it changed from one setting to this unbelievable setting with Coach chills with on your arm you know and and I I kind of they would sing with Elvis Presley at the backstage after he sang rock and roll and these guys would go you'll see them later on and you're going to have the have a question mark to listen to the music and uh while they were singing with Elvis at the back of the stage they could feel the Holy Ghost on their flesh as goose pimples comes I don't deny that but it's not on the right place it's on the flesh to this unbelievable setting with Co chills on your arm you know and and I I use the soul that in in my analogy of the Hol the Holy Spirit sort of came in there and it sort of dwelt Among Us and and we really begin to uh watch what he says the Holy Ghost dwelt amongst them the Holy Ghost don't give up until you cross the line says he dwelt amidst us but he didn't dwell in US young people I hope to shake you this morning I hope so and remember ministers this is for my church for my young people and this is the way God wants me to show them it's not worth it when the very stars that they fall follow is fallen stars and these fallen stars one's God go on brother you know and and I I kind of use that in in my analogy of the ho the Holy Spirit sort of came in there and it's sort of dwelt Among Us and and we really begin to uh live the words instead of singing the words it kind of came in there and saturated us made us all equal I think that's that's the thing that equals us all out because when El started singing you knew he meant what he what he was singing you know he he meant those words almost every time Elvis would sing How Great Thou Art he had a special feeling I mean sometimes you can pretend that you have an emotion in a song almost every time you sang that song you could feel the spirit of him because that was his actual praying prise to God he really believed every word in that song he knew how great God is I believe that he got more joy out of singing that song and I think you can tell when you see the video and when you hear it this this is this is the soul of Elvis when he sings that song oh Lord my God listen to that gift without [Music] repentance Wonder consider all the words I has have [Music] me I see Star I hear The Rolling Thunder I power throughout the you display sing it fellas Christ take me what Jo shall my then I shall bow in Humble ad adoration and their Proclaim oh my God how great the world then think my thought sa God to the how great so are how great th [Music] are and sing My Soul Our Savior God who the how great the Lord how great [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh you ever heard a gift like that you see the anointing behind it but that anointing is not calling anybody to Heaven it's calling everybody to Hell the devil sends his messenger with an anointing the people gets out of their mind when they hear him sing because gifts and callings is without [Music] [Applause] repentance and oh my God who was singing the background bul Gators group he just sang rock and roll now he just sang the the the the PS of hell now and people and woman would take out their penties and throw it uh amen and men will run naked around and people will faint uh amen because of the gift that that the devil gave him and the anointing the devil gave him and then he comes at the end of the coner How Great Thou Art then it feels for God he done the devil's Duty now he still wants an opportunity with God you cannot have God and have the devil at the same time out of one Fountain runs no two waters it's only one water and it's a clean water yes yes yes you say you say my but brother Rosco he sing gospel me brother I don't care if he sings gospel me he's still a devil why because Judas was also in the church and the Bible says they sang hymns and he also sang the hymns now you people that think the devil is Antichrist now you have learned something that the devil is religious Mah doesn't mean that he's right with God if he hasn't got uh if he hasn't got uh the qualities uh amen of a minister of God uh then you run away from him you better get away from [Applause] [Music] [Applause] him the sure rocked many soul he sure rocked The Souls of black and white and blue and pink and whatever he rocked all their souls but now they're rolling in hell that's all that rock and roll brings and pop this is the top guy right on top young people right top okay elv who was his friend bu Gator who is this is that one of bulat's boys could men like this go behind Elvis Pressley Rock and Roll Show and sing with Elvis's gospel they were caught up in the same thing I'm coming to this made Rocky also young people made rock your soul behold your God behold your God you go out on drugs and drinking and smoking and whoring and all that behold your God the devil's own messenger elv us went to Sunday school I don't care if you went to Sunday school let go on Daniel I'll just ch from here it was a church called East trig Baptist Church Reverend Herbert Brewster was the pastor great gentleman and a great gospel songwriter I gave the music a different approach a new beat I knew that it wasn't going to hurt if I said much Jesus boss alone whether I've said with one beat two beat whether I've said it high low and I told him come on in here and and put your stuff together they came in here and it was a glorious experience and Elvis was in that group they had a glorious experience and Elvis was in the group Elvis learned the gospel amen that old negro gospel songs from this preacher right in the church and you your mom and dad is in the church and you come along and you think you're right here has Elvis also been in the church but the devil okay my brother came in here and it was a glorious experience and Elvis was in that group growing up in a Pentecostal church he had seen God work powerfully and he threw himself into his faith as passionately as his music we according to Elvis inspired him to sing and inspired him to sing the way he sings that he got his U he got his the blackhood brothers inspired Elvis we Al Mana better be very care for what we see you musicians you better wake up you know why Elvis could sing like that because him and his father was one his father was a good singer the Bible says he was a chorus leader well God send me to make sense this was never made sense to and I don't care what you think about me ministers in the message this is made sense to okay we according to Elvis inspired him to sing and inspired him to sing the way he sings that he got his uh he got his expressions and his uh way of singing from the Statesman quartet and the Blackwood Brothers those were the two dominant groups during that era when Elvis was coming up and they had the greatest influence is that all the the the the video of these guys Idol and singing B singer the Statesman they call him the big Che I'll this of my house kind of after the Big Chief but I didn't know but I know now I'm just glad that to have had a part in his early upbringing and his inspiration to [Music] sing Luc stands next to Elis the greatest bus [Music] singer you know him or just open my eyes that I may see Lead Me Oh [Music] Lord I am tired and I need I string and to guide me [Music] over or just open my eyes that I may sing me that's right [Music] me you Elvis Love B singing there was a sing done at the do you know that [Music] man you hear El was sing and surely what the man said you can feel the the the P amen of a man that's seeking for God and that just shows you what the word of God says esos SE after singing rock and roll and after sending millions of souls to hell he'll come back and he would like to be in contact with God what was he doing he was seeking for salvation and he didn't find it you young people you're never going to be the same after [Applause] this Elvis Love B singing there was a sing down at the Lis Auditorium which was two blocks from where he lived in the housing project he was always at the Saints and then one month he missed and the next month he came back I said Son where were you last month why didn't you come he said I didn't have enough money to buy a ticket I said well you won't need any money from now on I just come to the stage door I let you in for nothing and that's the way it remained until about the next thing I knew he was letting me in his stage door cuz I didn't have the money though he sang of his faith with conviction Elvis was troubled by questions that seemed to have he had questions and now you know what these questions was how can I be saved and it says it was never answered he died with a question I wonder if I've got the Holy Ghost I wonder if I'm right with God he had tears in his eyes young people tears looking for God looking for the way back and I'm so glad in this 20th century how mean in this Century that we're living in that there is a way to God uh there is a Divine approach amen and I'm not ashamed to say itth the spoken word amen the Holy Ghost and the spoken word with preaching under the anointing takes you back to God again [Applause] life loved though he sang of his faith with conviction Elvis was troubled by questions that seemed to have no answers when the storm exactly at that time when he couldn't have an answer the answer was walking around in Jeffersonville on two feet but that's not what he wanted he wanted an answer that he could still be the rock King but this answer on 2 in Jeffersonville said you are Judas and he didn't win that that was God's answer okay let it go he sang of his faith with conviction Elvis was troubled by questions that seem to have no answers no answers when the storms of life are raging stand by there was nobody to stand with him when the storms was raging when the storms of life are raging stand by in your day of Calamity I will love at you your days of storm when the world is tosing me like a ship out on the sea thou who rulest when what stand by I think that Elvis thought that he'd wake up and find that it was all over with you know it was just it was just a dream when I'm gr and when he woke up it was not only a deem a reality according to the prophet of the hour he'll tell you where Elvis woke up oh here's a quote here brother Bram says Alvis will walk up to the judgment and all his records will be plain for him as he walks up to the judgment oh I wish but I walk up to the throne of God that all my messages will be bluring out in front of my God and I tried my best I tried my best I tried my best young people I'm trying my best [Applause] he'd wake up and found that it was all over with you know it just it was just a dream when I'm growing old you didn't grow old [Music] and when I'm growing though his most Ardent fans felt he could do no wrong Elvis was well aware of his shortcomings and grew increasingly uncomfortable with the agulation lavished upon [Music] him look at this he frequently read the Bible and often prayed with those around him one you read the word from now onward ministers don't tell me about the word the word the word tell me about the Holy Ghost that leads you to the word then I'll start listening to you Elvis also read the word Judas also read the [Applause] word he frequently read the Bible and often prayed with those around him one notable example was the evening he learned that Sylvia shenell a member of his background group the Sweet Inspirations received news that she had been diagnosed with cancer we got to Vegas and as we he prayed he touched Sylvia's stomach and he asked God to move whatever it was just take it away and the next morning when syvia reported to Sunrise Hospital there in Las Vegas they did the test and it was gone whatever it was whether it was a misdiagnosis or whether God had healed Sylvia through Elvis's faith and our faith I don't know but we believed and Elvis believed also that God had worked a miracle through him he would discuss Elvis read the word Elvis prayed and Elvis had a Healing Ministry but the holy ghost thing he admitted that he hasn't got it okay faith and our faith I don't know but we believed and all us believed also that God had worked a miracle from him he would discuss spiritual ideas with us and I remember that we were standing in a circle one night and this was in Vegas and he said I want you all to close your eyes he said we're going to we weren't going to pray but he just said I want you to close your eyes and I was thinking in my mind I'll never forget this I was going to say Elvis what do you think about heaven I was going to ask him what he thought about heaven and I had my eyes closed and he said Jim we're going to get to that just a moment and I open my eyes and he and I said to what he said you were going to ask me about heaven weren't you and I said yeah he even had discernment and you people in the message says well brother OS who's got discernment he's a prophet no Elvis also had it and you must have it each individual must have [Music] discernment that's thus sayth the Lord because brother Bron said it in discernment of spirits and Discerning the Lord's body okay my brother discuss spiritual ideas with us and I remember that we were standing in a circle one [Music] night and this was in Vegas and he said I want you all to close your eyes he said we're going to we weren't going to pray but he just said I want you to close your eyes and I was thinking in my mind I'll never forget this I was going to say Elvis what do you think about heaven I was going to ask him what he thought about heaven and I had my eyes closed and he said Jim we're going to get to that just a moment and I opened my eyes and he and I said to what he said you were going to ask me about heaven weren't you and I said yeah he said we'll get that in just a minute that blew me away I don't know how how that happened Elvis is very spiritual he uh believed that he had a certain connection with God not so much more than anybody else listen closely because when I come up to the quotes it's all that brother brandham saw even before she spoke about this and then you'll believe there's a prophet in the land and the apostolic gift will amen that Prophet around every day okay brother Elvis was very spiritual he uh believed that he had a certain connection with God not so much more than anybody else did but in his search he was trying to get close to God so in his search and Judas what did Judas do for repentance he tried his utmost place to get repentance he was searching for God and he yet religious there's no way you can find god brother briam says God works through a Ministry only way God works there's where you'll finding okay brother with God not so much more than anybody else did but in his search he was trying to get close to God so he felt that by helping others maybe that was his Elvis had even the revelation of others God made me preach before we got this [Applause] video but in his search he was trying to get close to God so he felt that by helping others maybe that was his mission and I remember just looking at him and I said man you are really really blessed and I said you know as great as this album is and all the success you have I said you know God is the one who made all this possible I said God has placed you in a unique situation and I said you know you are really blessed and he turned to me and he said you know I know that huh and I know that I couldn't have done it without God and that just keep that one also in mind you'll hear what brother brandham says okay brother and all this possible I said God has placed you in a unique situation and I said you know you are really blessed and he turned to me and he said you know I know that and I know that I couldn't have done it without God and that just you know a lot of people think that he was insensitive to it but he realized that everything that came to him came from God and he and he cherished it that that way his friends noted that Elvis was often confused about why God had allowed him such success in a clan yet he never questioned that his gifts were from God perhaps that's why the song He Touched Me was particularly meaningful to his the hand of Jesus touched me and now I am no I'm not here today to make him an angel I'm not here to make him a saint and I'm just telling you the truth and how he was and he but I read believe this whole deep this deep Foundation that his mother had these deep roots in the church uh gave Ela something to shoot for maybe something happen and now I know he touch [Music] me concert he just called us out to do it in the concert nobody knew nothing about it none of us knew we going to do it at all it just sort of an impromptu thing but I think it was it really put us kind of put us on the map so to speak I mean it kind of put us after the concer where people knew who we were ladies and gentlemen if you would I would like to ask the stamps if they would sing a song that they do by themselves it's a beautiful song called sweet sweet spirit and I don't sing in this just listen to them please I am not singing yes Sweet Holy Spirit I'm not singing this cuz I'm not a part of that catch it watch it ladies and gentlemen if you would I would like to ask the stamps if they would sing a song that they do by themselves it's a beautiful song called sweet sweet spirit and I don't sing in this just listen to them please a sweet sweet spirit in this and I know that is the of the Lord there are [Music] sweet for each look at the [Music] tears that look at the [Music] tears Sweet [Music] Holy sweet St up their [Music] tears to too late too late blessing [Music] we without a doubt know that we have been when [Music] [Music] we look at that tears running down his cheeks that's why I read that scripture about Esau here they singing the greatest thing that could happen to humanity the Holy Spirit and yeah Elva says I cannot join with them I cannot sing with them I cannot I cannot connect with them in the song because I I can't reach this Holy Ghost but let them sing it and you'll know this is the thing that I'm short I know the word I read the word every day as we hear them say it amen I have have gifts of healing and I I have discernment and and I do pray but I this one thing the holy ghost thing I don't have and I can't join with them in singing and while they singing eso's tears is running and God is not answering young people your Elvis Presley that you want to follow the school friends wor this is how he felt and you sit right in a church where you can have a thing that Elvis will never never never never never never never never never never never never never never get and you that's got it keep it with two hands [Applause] though he sang of his faith with conviction Elvis was troubled by questions that seemed to have no answers listen to the song there must be lights burning brighter somewhere there wasn't Jeff be birds flying higher in a sky Eagles in Jeffers If I Can Dream of a better land where all my brothers walk in there was somebody that was in at land oh why oh why can't my dream come true his dream never come true oh why there must be peace and understanding sometimes strong wind of promise that will throw away all the doubt and fear If I Can Dream of a warmer Sun where hope keeps shining on every be one tell me why oh why oh why want that son son never appeared to you Jesus Christ we're lost in a cloud with too much rain we're trapped in a world that trouble with pain but as long as the man has the spr to dream he can redeem his soul and life there's a vision where there is no vision the people die my question still I am sure that the answer answer is going to come somehow out there in the dark a CLE oh yeah and why I can see while I can walk while I can stand while I can talk while I Can Dream leave let my dream come true right now let oh [Applause] [Music] yeah why doesn't my dream come true deep in my heart there's a dream somewhere The Sun Shines brighter yes Elvis just on the other side of in Jefferson Bol the sun deep sign because it is the rising of the sun somewhere the Birds flies higher yes Elvis just on the other side in Jefferson B there's a bird called an eagle a prophet that fly higher someone had a dream yes Elvis just there in Jefferson B there's a prophet that had a dream a vision that showed us on the other side of Heaven why didn't your dream come true because you made yourself an agent of Lucifer and you reject it God you backslid you went to the world and you left God you crossed the line and right at the end of your ministry Elvis you're saying why don't my dream come true every dream that's not based on eternal life will will never come true but I believe that my dream that's in my heart that there will be people in Al Tabernacle that's going to make it I know that you're shaken I was so shaken when I looked at this video I was not myself for weeks my brother Morgan asked me to take the funeral they will tell you how I preached I felt if Elvis could give his all for the devil what's wrong with that garage at the beginning Elvis couldn't see anything wrong with his rock and roll it was so nice it was so pleasant in the beginning when the friends comes around you young person amen and they they introduce you to Dr into cigarettes it looks so nice but you cannot see the wrong that's in it and what it's going to do for you he couldn't see that the devil was interlaced in his lyrics oh Alvis he couldn't see hell's arms was open like never before to take the young people to hell in his songs he couldn't see that Fallen Angels was anointing him and the crowds as they sweep through the minds of the young people by his music the 60s started off with a gutter of folk the 60s actually spurned off every vile thing that's on the earth now the 60s amen brought in the to be a virgin is out of fashion serving God is oh Mur going to church is outdated going on a trip through the drugs and and and and and have a long trip with drugs that's the in thing I would rather have that dream alvers a dream of drugs a dream that takes you on a trap uh that's what the young people want uh but I want to tell you amen I have a dream too and I have a vision too and my vision is a shout and a voice and a trumpet and I'll be changed uh in a moment in that twinkling an eye and the lost Trump and the Trump of [Applause] God the 60s brought in to the young people to love past Die Young and make a goodlooking corpse make a nice corpse but what lays behind that corpse is hell you're not nice there because the word of almighty God says there is nashing and weeping of tears after the corpse so I don't want to be a nice corpse I want to be a nice Christian in the six Dimension before God gives me the seventh [Music] Elvis was the blanket listen here the 60s brought in this gut of fult the devil was gone countering God what was the devil doing when he sent Elvis Presley he was countering God because right there in the 60s the greatest thing that ever happened outside of Calvary happened 196 three when seven angels came down from glory and they brought the book of redemption the Seven Seals amen what did the devil do he wanted to throw a blanket over that thing so that his colleagues couldn't see Redemption power but see him as the king of rock and roll he watered down God having a prophet because he wanted to be hell's King he watered down by singing The Great shalom shalom shalom good morning bride he threw that over and watered it down in the 60s oh God he took the sting of 1963 out from his people the demonic people take the sting out just in case they will come and get saved amen the devil says Okay God you have a prophet you have a holy prophet I will send my property and his name will be Elvis don't you call your child Elvis hell opened wider in the 60s Amen to accept the millions and the millions and the millions and the millions that Elvis freshly pushed into hell even up till now they that lived in the 1960s you look at them they still have earrings on and long hair it goes every musical thing that comes on the earth goes with hairstyles Hallelujah [Applause] and the hell brought on itself to receive the messages Elvis put them into hell and I'm going to read the quote for you and you ministers that don't understand Edgar Rosco why don't you just leave me alone I'm called higher than you when I said uh give me your soul I knew what I was saying [Applause] I am called higher than you whether you like it or whether you don't I am 60 years old and I know if I do not know by now I will never know [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hell open wide in the 60s and I want to tell you he took the millions and the millions uh amen but have it open to receive the minute group uh that will believe that God send the message with the Holy Spirit and with angels and Heaven also open their arms uh to everyone that believe this message of the day the Dynamics and and the mechanics together that's the message of the hour no other message Hallelujah I had a dream and my dream will come [Applause] true and after Elvis prly many will follow and be his ministers after he goes there will be many that will follow him to keep the fire of Hell Ablaze Ministers of Elvis Presley and after William brandham lives because here the devil had his messenger here God had his messenger here the devil has ministers there sure must be ministers that will keep William bram's Word Alive there will be crows there will be crows there will be crows [Applause] let's go to the quotes quickly life 1957 that rock and roll Alvis Presley a modern Judas es scariot that boy was a Christian in a Pentecostal Church 1957 we only got it now but it was already laid down in 1957 who he was oh my god with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says with the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we know what he what they said they felt it on their flesh and brother Braham knows what he's talking about if Elvis had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he couldn't say he Judas a scariot because Judas scariot showed his colors when it came to the Holy Ghost hallelujah oh I feel like the messenger of God this morning Hallelujah I feel like an angel amen the fold Ministry is an angel that the angel of the [Applause] church Hallelujah glory to God in the highest amen listen Pentecostal church amen now listen what brother BR says I know he's Pastor the prophet know Alvis Presley's Pastor he knew the man that actually pastored him when he was small until he became a rock and roll king can you imagine how brother brandham spoke to the pastor listen I knew his Pastor oh oh God I knew his Pastor Elvis Presley's Pastor his mother his mother and them well he knew Elvis Presley mother well and he called Alvis Judas and listen what he says listen what he says nation has ever listen what he says the greatest hindrance at this nation no I'm not there uh listen what he says the Holy Ghost I know his parents his mother and them well but he sold his Birthright why did you read Esau because Esau is the one that sold his Birthright amen with tears why did Elvis cry brother Brown says he sold his Birthright don't sell your Birthright don't sell your Christian don't give it to the dogs and tomorrow you want to come back you can't make it brother then you have to make your way to hell i'll imagine Elvis pressure will be All Shook Up on that morning sure enough his records will be a reality when he hears the bleeding of the millions of souls that he that he sends to hell not that the devil sent to that Elvis sent to hell now if Elvis my brothers could take souls to Hell there must be five for Ministries that will take souls to heaven give me your soul your pastor will see you [Applause] [Music] through hallelujah hallelujah but El expressly perverted the listen what he says but Elvis prey perverted the right thing when he was a Christian he took the right thing and perverted it that's why after he feels so guilty they say that he would call the blackhood brothers and all that and he'll make them sing right through the night until the next morning to try and kill the conviction of the Holy Ghost and to try to get nearer to God and he could not get nearer to God and friends once you cross the line there is no way you can get closer to God there is no way that you can come to God it's finished finished finish try to get near to God perverted the right thing that Elvis Presley sang was the right thing perverted the prophet knew his mother Point number one and his Pastor the prophet says he sold his Birthright just like Esau did had the Holy Ghost Amen on the the outside realm until G pimples came his records will be played on Judgment Day right on Judgment Day Jail House Rock that the jail house is rocked what is the jail house the Bible says that the devil doesn't open his prison house his jail house it will be rocking as it welcomes millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions to hell you cannot just go to hell somebody's going to lead you there and you cannot go to heaven unless somebody lead you [Applause] then he sent them to hell in the Millions Elvis perverted the right thing many of people on that all Baptist songs and I want to tell you did you notice that Elvis sang All the Small the the the the slow hymns the hymns that the so-called Baptist in the message like Elvis also sang it so don't give it to Edgar Rosco amen it's not the hymn that you sing it's the spirit behind the hymns yes it is what Spirit leads you to sing amen that slow song songs or the fast songs if it's a wrong Spirit it is [Applause] wrong brother Bram says in spiritual atmosphere amen I wish I could just get it spiritual atmosphere just give me a chance I got a things to line up here page 11 somewhere around page 11 marmala series amen man marvelously he says take it in in the devil's work go over and say we're going to dance one man standing up and saying well now he don't know about whether he wants to dance or not and this girl over and she she that and the music playing Nearer My God to thee listen nearer slow song Nearer My God to me ah what an atmosphere for a dance well that's not any differ than what a lot of atmosphere you go into church for a service of God just that contrary says what an atmosphere near to my God to me he says the only thing to bring the right atmosphere then for the dance is to put on their old music that makes dances in other words Nearer My God to me you can't dance with it amen and when are you going to fulfill the word when you have near my God to me every week in your church that means you're not fulfilling the Bible you're not fulfilling the word and the bride will be the word of God from Genesis to Revelation she'll sing near to my God to me and she'll sing a nice song for the dance amen for jubilation that Jesus Christ is alive and the Seven Seals is full back Hallelujah hit the balance hit the balance I'm glad for El Tabernacle we hit the [Applause] balance Hallelujah oh God Amen going to take my time yet countdown Sunday 1964 and this is the reason why go into South Africa listen not into Mexico not into amen Ghana not into uh Zimbabwe not into England not into Germany but go into South Africa going to South Africa and they were so why Elvis Presley is a very religious boy did you hear that on the video he the prophet brings in 1964 Elvis press is a very religious boy he sings hymns oh that doesn't mean nothing to me it's another Judas es scariot all the nice hymns that he sang all the good How Great Thou Art amen the devil also knows how great he [Applause] is that don't make him a Christian if Elvis prey was a Christian why did he die of drugs his music took him to drugs and maybe that same music will take them to Armageddon right in South Africa here in South Africa they say he's religious you know he sings religious songs and and and and and you know and you listen here not all over in South Africa not here here we say what the prophet says he is a incarnate devil yes he is handwriting on the wall 1958 and Elvis Presley and make a little album or some kind of a religious service right after the meetings religious service rock and roll on one side and religion on the other side the prophet knew Alva sang religious songs and with who did he sing it bugat there now now shook his his hips and just now real sad and singing one song he gave the whole night for the devil and he gave a little two minutes for God my God needs all the time either you serve God or you don't serve him at all either you do what God wants you to do or you don't do it at all young people either you serve God or set it home until you made up your mind that it's not one side the world and one side God it's all Bes sides [Applause] God we making sense to the word of God Now understand why brother Brenham says and I could never understand it I'm long in the message and that doesn't mean that I'm saved because I'm long in the I must fight the fight but I'm just saying that to make a point I could never understand the unentertained Christ Jesus with dir fet where he says that these singers they keep in the note until they blew in the face and I said Lord who is is he speaking about why does he say that until I saw this video they were right there when brother Brenham was there and brother Brenham saw them amen singing amen hymns with uh Elvis Presley and brother Brenham nailed Elvis Presley and he turned around he says and this Bunch that keeps that breath in so long to keep the note he says they not singing for God that was not singing for God [Applause] now I have the sense to what brother Brandon says I looked right in there and God showed me right in there listen here this is that bigus uh concubines that brother brandham spoke about they are concubines of Elvis Presley he pregnated them with hell now they sing until tears run down their cheeks hey do you know how many Souls you sent to hell I don't care how many hmns you sing and how many video tapes is out you're still making money brother brandom says God is never without a witness cuz the devil is never out without a witness let me be God's witness oh God help us it's all that we ask help us by faith Moses 958 I don't care how many albums Alvis Presley writes of all the good religious songs good religious songs soft religious songs nice religious songs How Great Thou Are he touched me and all that that do baptist in the message love Elvis sang it brother brandham says he's still possessed of the devil your pastor can sing all that soft songs and all that BST songs he can still be possessed with the devil even if he sings that it is the spirit behind [Applause] it hit the balance get the balance [Applause] oh God says you never heard of a name like that in days gone by Alvis or Ricky and it just a name of the age that name had to come when the other name Brenham came there was never a Brenham a ham amen with letters from the time of Abraham and here that name had to come in the end hour but Judas also amen and send a man with a name for the first time Alvis showing you God showing you the devil oh people young people let your eyes open that name could only come in this hour Elvis he here oh here's where I go home Lord Christ the mystery 1963 if you only knew the numerology of the Bible and know what Elvis or Ricky means to the scriptures if you only knew the Bible Code the numerology the Bible Code he says you will otherwise run away from Elvis and what did I do when I got this quot i Phone brother Willies I said check this up in the numerology of the Bible check what the Bible says in the [Applause] Torah about Elvis and in the King James virgin and when they look into the Bible Code long before Elvis was born 4,000 years ago God wrote of Elva's name right in the numerology young people I'm not playing right in the numerology right in the Bible Code because brother Braham say in a numerology of the Bible he knew one day it will come forth and there will one be one person that will not be scared to use it and that's Edgar [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Rosco Hallelujah in the numerology of the Bible what Elvis mean and the Bible quote says Elvis mean Evil 2 Peter 52 1 Samuel 8:3 that's a Bible quote the second thing that Elvis means is a liar a beast a deceiver a devil amen this is on one Matrix in Elvis's name that is what he is that's what the Bible says he is and I don't care how you feel I don't care what you think if the Bible says he's a devil then he is a [Applause] devil Hallelujah and you can follow the devil if you want to young people but Jesus Christ is here amen the angel with a swap back Wings the eighth messenger Jesus Christ I will follow him [Applause] Hallelujah and around the other one the other metrix is Elvis and Elvis means rockar Amen on one metrix that is circled around his name when his name comes then next to his name rockar and it's circled this is thousands of years before Elvis was born the Bible already said he's coming oh god brother Bram says the numerology of God run for your lives young people run for your lives and the next metrics under Alvis will say shackles and silver and money with Alvis sheckles money and brother Braham say is a more than judas's Carri it Judah sold Christ for 30 pieces of silver and he for millions of dollars and yet the Bible says it that his name is connected with money and the Bible says that Lucifer set on the money of the world young people young people wake up and the num numerology of God goes on Amen on the next metrix it says connected with Elvis is hell in Hell the next metric Elvis in hell where did he go to although he's saying how great thou art it doesn't mean that you saved you seen great how great you are but you live like a devil only one way it's the way I laid down in this church Holiness Hallelujah not the word not the revealed word not the spoken word the manifested word when those words are manifested then you saved not the books when the books is living in you not the spoken wood book The spoken wood book is paper that paper must change into flesh written Apostles read of all man then you're marching to heaven [Applause] proper Revelation a decent Revelation where there's no vision that people die Hallelujah in Hell Elvis the Bible Code the Bible and the Elvis next to that is in hell and you're following a man like that that's already in hell young people AR shaking you today and wherever the tape goes every young person will be shaken show me who you follow then I'll tell you who you [Applause] are in the next metrix it says we took Presley and Presley is connected with petition second Peter 37 that's the Bible the six metric says another metric says with Presley comes drugs cause his death you mean thousands of years before he died of drugs the Bible says Presley dies of drugs and then he dies of drugs is that thus saith the Lord yes yes it is I will take the Bible and I will reject every other minister if he says that Elvis is saved I'll say no he crossed the line like Judas scariot and like Esau heard the truth heard the truth heard the truth heard he must change his life heard it but never done it and the day that they really want to get saved With Tears in their eyes they cannot come God is Not mocked he died of drugs and I think he tried to drown his convictions after when he couldn't find repentance the best thing to give drugs is the best thing to give up drugs is never to start with it I won't be able to help you when you cross that line loving kindness and Alvis prey with his All Shook Up rock and roll the reason you do it because something in there making and craving for that if the Holy Ghost hand had that heart fold you wouldn't have no desire for Alvis fres and his rock and roll there BR puts the things straight and the Holy Ghost is there your desires are [Applause] changed God keeps his word 57 I do not like to call people's names but I'm going to call somebody somebody his name now but I pray for the young man and I pray all the time for him but he is a instrument in the hands of the devil and that is this man Elvis Presley the people are gone Boogie hooi and rock and roll wild I like church music played like church music and not rock and roll in the church but when they get the spirit there's something something behind this you see I said the spirit there's something behind that Spirit whether it's soft music and nice hymns there's a spirit behind it you're doing that because you don't like the Holy Ghost that's why you like that soft music because you don't like dancing that's why you don't want the church to dance there's a spirit behind it with your soft HS message Pastor I pull no punches and I have no Reg [Applause] RS so like for there's something behind this and the devil puts himself out a challenge and it happens to be that this poor backslid Pentecostal boy shaking he caught it and learned it in church he is a member of the first Assemblies of God in Memphis Tennessee his Pastor is a friend of mine and he is the devil's instrument for delting and polluting the minds of the teenagers that's why I said this is for the young people polluting the minds of the young people they just left the place in Canada and I think they sent 14 young people to the insane asylum a few days after he was there they went cuckoo when to get this quotes and there's a lot that I still bring out watching Jesus feet and Elvis pry and all that there nonsense that's produced and put out to the American people's minds is contaminated with such stuff and then it even get into the Ministeries and they try to flower the pulpit they try to flower the pullit with that Elvis Presley is like he said in South Africa they say he religious they flower the poit did you realize that that is exactly what Cain did you know where that uh uh Cain come from Cain he had an altar same as Abel Kane had an altar and Elvis Presley had an altar what was his altar all the scils that he's saying and what does the altar do call you to some place Cain had an altar and Abel had an altar brother Brenham had an altar and Elvis had an altar Elvis altar took them to hell and God has an altar that can take you to heaven hallelujah hallelujah he types Elvis with Cain and Esau another altar rock and roll alar and the altar of God listen to this Corinthians book of symbols 957 and you get these little old sissified man today with a shock of hair cut down low on his neck like that and a pair of side barns like Elvis Presley and stand up and make all this boogie hooie stuff and you Christians try to impersonate an impostor like that now if you have sideburns you impersonating Elvis Presley I'm so glad I don't have gluts so that it can fall down here I'll be too scared to cut the gluts off cuz I want to be like Elvis I want to feel it in my neck I don't have to feel it in my neck I want to feel it in my heart [Applause] the side Burns cut it off young man if your hairstyle is like Elvis hairstyle amen it just speaks about Elvis you're keeping Elvis alive with that hairstyle evidence of the Resurrection 58 there's only one difference between Elvis and judas's carrier Judas got 30 pieces of silver for selling out Elvis got a few Millions dollars and a fleet of Cadillacs that's all the difference you can take all of your little old chopped up Elvis Pressly boogie hooi in the name of Christianity you can have it give me those oldfashioned heart stirring love songs of the Gospel heart stirring [Music] that's a sped behind it hard storying God's gifts always finds 1963 Elvis Presley red FY Ernie for pet Bo Elvis Presley a Pentecostal Paton a Church of Christ red Ford a deacon in the Church of Christ Ernest for I think is a Methodist C Richards so called Born Again Michael Jackson Jehovah Witness they're all religious the word Elvis means a cat and the word Ricky means a rat you can go look in the dictionaries you won't find it there until you see the the numerology of the of the Bible Code his real name is in the Bible Code not what what some scientists try to make him nice he's not nice he sent a lot of my brothers to hell every time music comes comes the hairstyle oh edar Rosco even stops the woman at the door yes I will because no rock star or pop star or whatever star is going to walk in here in another form in another person amen by having that haircut she's actually carrying that person we want to carry Jesus Christ [Applause] hallu Hallelujah [Applause] oh listen what he says in Corinthians book of symbols he says Catholics but he sold out he was a Pentecostal believer and sold out his Birthright to become a rock and roll and is inspired by the devil and I don't pull any punches on it no sir and a modern Judas is carot Elvis pry say I trust God for all my successes is that what you heard there brother brandham already put it down in 1957 this video only came out now he says a holy God ever gives success to vulgarity and a devil demonized thing that's absolutely been out of the greatest Hind es that this nation ever heard brother brandom turns around he says I

rock now comes the worst of them all the worst of them all Michael daxon he's the worst of them all never in the history of music was there ever a man named Michael CU Michael ends it the Torah says in the Bible Code about Michael Jackson Michael Jackson it says evil devil murderer it goes in the other metrics it says an Avenger of blood El's Blood Cuz Elvis couldn't take them further into hell he'll take them they say he's more greater than Alvis Presley made more money than Alvis Presley he man he had more audiences than Alvis Presley he was he's The Beetles and Elvis Presley in one person and if the Bible says that he's the Evangel of blood and he is and next to his name is Priscilla Elvis's daughter he couldn't marry anybody but Elvis's daughter because he had to match up with Elvis in marriage man what are you hearing what are you hearing man amen we preach the word the reveal word the Revelation made sense to bring a manifestation he had to marry Priscilla Elvis's daughter and he's got the what you call it on all Elvis Presley's music you can't have Elvis press his music until you write to Michael Jackson the two have become one the one started it the other one finished it the one came with the name of brandham and the other one came in the name of a man that's called the Apostle of God could only come now the two names had to come together don't care what you say it's the truth [Applause] [Applause] right in the hour right in the hour where a Ministry came by Revelation and preached Michael and open up Michael a fire4 minister amen and went around the world and place Michael right at that hour right at that time now I spoke about Michael years ago and I was first down by the ministers because they didn't know Christ the mystery and I read it right in Christ the mystery and I said it and they said where did he get it from even up till now they said where does he get it from but if you're not call on my realm it's up to you I preach according to my [Applause] faith Elvis Presley could only move his pis because he was Elvis pis but Michael Jackson moves his toes until his head he could go like this and there's nobody they said never will there ever be a man that will be able to dance like Michael [Applause] Jackson any brother Brandon felt like that about Alvis how would he have felt about Michael Jackson and the same thing that God spoke about Elvis it speaks about Michael Jackson have we got it I was amazed when I saw him dancing now you said did you watch it I'll watch it because I want to preach on it I never knew it and brother and watched Elvis and he knew what Elvis sang and who sang with Elvis that's why he could preach against it brother Bram says even the Beatles they are healers and he made one of the brothers read a cut out of Readers Digest how the Beatles healed people and of there was never never a man like that worse than Elvis Presley I wonder young people are these the men that you would like to follow or
