[0:16] he had no comparison he had no one to
[0:19] compare himself with
[0:21] he couldn't look at any other person but
[0:24] himself he had to look Beyond everything
[0:27] else he had to search high and low but
[0:32] when he came to that place there was
[0:34] nothing that compared to the Holiness
[0:36] that he was and God had to look at
