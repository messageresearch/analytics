[1:22:44] greatest Authority an angel from heaven
[1:22:47] or an angel at the pulpit which has the
[1:22:50] greatest Authority that's why Paul says
[1:22:53] if an angel comes from Heaven Hallelujah
[1:22:56] and he doesn't say what I say let him he
[1:22:58] be a curse amen because the man in the

[1:23:07] has more Authority

[1:23:30] there amen amen Apostle amen Apostle
[1:23:35] [Applause]
[1:23:44] amen that's why I can understand now
[1:23:47] when the apostles says that Mighty Angel
[1:23:50] when he dropped down he had to drop down
[1:23:52] into 26 elements
[1:23:56] because down here he doesn't have
[1:23:58] authority but in 60 26 elements he has
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:08] Authority a angel can't speak to you God
[1:24:11] needs a man a man with the mouth so that
[1:24:15] you can have an ear and hear what the
[1:24:16] mouth what the angel in the poop says to
[1:24:19] you and if the angel in the poop says
[1:24:22] you more than an overcomer then you more
[1:24:24] than of Overcomer because he's got
[1:24:26] Authority when he speaks Heaven stands
[1:24:29] at attention and says you better go
[1:24:31] answer my servant he's got more
[1:24:34] Authority than any angel in heaven then
[1:24:37] the answer must come uh then healing
[1:24:39] must come uh then Deliverance must come
[1:24:42] when the angel in the pulet speak then
[1:24:45] something must happen then the Holy
[1:24:47] Ghost will fall then something will
[1:24:49] happen to you and something will happen
[1:24:52] to me when he speaks
[1:24:54] something
[1:24:56] [Applause]
[1:25:05] happens

[1:25:10] [Applause]
[1:25:19] amen William Brenham can't speak anymore
[1:25:22] he's an angel in the Oran
[1:25:27] form but God will have somebody in the
[1:25:30] pit an angel behind the
[1:25:35] pit that has more
[1:25:37] Authority
[1:25:39] Hallelujah it means if he has more
[1:25:42] Authority than an angel in heaven it
[1:25:45] means he speaks before that
[1:25:48] angel when he speaks that angel must
[1:25:51] obey
