Heavenly Father, as we can recall, Lord God, he was a elder died five times, Lord God, and the ministry gave him a new heart, Lord God. He was a young man, Lord God, blind, and the ministry prayed for him and eyeballs fall back into his sockets, Lord God. Somewhere in Brazil, a woman lost the arm in an accident, Lord God.
