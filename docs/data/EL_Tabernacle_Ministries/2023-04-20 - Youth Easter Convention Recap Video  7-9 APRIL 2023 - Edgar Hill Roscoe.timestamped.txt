[22:30] [Music]
[22:35] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[22:39] I'm a bit nervous it's actually my first
[22:42] time standing here
[22:49] [Applause]
[22:52] I'd like to share some few testimonies
[22:54] that took place at the University to
[22:57] where I'm studying uh what God has done
[23:00] for us is the young people that side
[23:03] so um it all started in 2019 so 2019 the
[23:08] first brother that came there was uh
[23:10] brother Teng from Springs
[23:12] and uh that's the priority that
[23:14] testified to me as well and then when he
[23:17] came there he said to me my brother
[23:20] I won't stop testifying until the whole
[23:23] future becomes the UL Tabernacle
[23:29] um those words actually came in straight
[23:31] into my heart and that's what I told
[23:34] myself as well is that I won't stop
[23:36] testifying until the whole Beauty
[23:39] becomes the new El Tabernacle
[23:42] [Applause]
[23:46] uh so the first test we actually have a
[23:49] lot of testimonies but uh because of
[23:51] time I'll just say a few that are close
[23:55] to my heart or the ones that threatened
[23:57] me in my faith in L7 naked
[24:00] uh so last year
[24:03] so we were actually at the
[24:06] at the rest is normal
[24:09] so it happened that one of the students
[24:12] there they She fainted and When She
[24:15] fainted now they try to wake her up and
[24:18] then to pour water on here but nothing
[24:21] happened she wasn't waking up
[24:23] and then the rest manager actually he
[24:26] knows what we are Christian so he said
[24:29] no they have to call those guys they
[24:30] have to call those young men's to come
[24:32] and help us
[24:34] and then
[24:35] they call they called us and then we
[24:37] looked at her and then yeah she was not
[24:41] moving nothing
[24:42] and then we went to the study here and
[24:44] we told them that okay everyone must
[24:46] come out and it was only us and the
[24:48] brothers and the and that girl and then
[24:51] we took um we we played an instrument a
[24:55] mystery
[24:56] and then when you play that instrument
[24:59] um
[25:00] we started uh we started praying and
[25:03] then we prayed and prayed and prayed and
[25:05] then I heard they're screaming once and
[25:07] then she woke up
[25:09] and then when we put out
[25:12] actually when we got out to find out
[25:14] that the rest manager was standing at
[25:17] the door his wife was also there all the
[25:20] students were there they even called the
[25:22] ambulance to come and take that girl
[25:25] but when we came out with her she was
[25:27] fine completely fine
[25:29] [Applause]
[25:34] and then
[25:36] yeah it was it was a big scene my
[25:39] brothers and sisters because even those
[25:40] people of the ambulance they didn't know
[25:43] what happened they just too careful test
[25:46] but we went the following day she told
[25:48] us that she was perfectly fine
[25:52] [Applause]
[25:57] um and then the next testimony I would
[26:00] like to share is actually the one
[26:01] whereby
[26:03] um I realized something about this man
[26:05] that we have here the apostol
[26:08] uh is not an ordinary man brothers and
[26:11] sisters
[26:13] now it's not an ordinary man
[26:17] this man doesn't just preach the weight
[26:20] he unknowns the weight
[26:23] I believe everywhere that comes out of
[26:25] the Apostles mouth those words they are
[26:27] anointed
[26:29] I remember this other time I was
[26:32] actually testifying to one see stuff
[26:34] from the University of Pretoria usually
[26:38] here if she's baptized now
[26:40] uh I was just I was testifying to her
[26:44] and I remember this one time I said you
[26:46] know what my sister next time will speak
[26:48] I will be telling you about the Holy
[26:50] Ghost what is the Holy Ghost how do you
[26:53] receive the Holy Ghost and how do you
[26:54] know that you have the Holy Ghost
[26:57] and then I didn't know what where to
[27:00] start I didn't know what to say so I
[27:02] decided to watch the one of the Apostles
[27:05] tape is called how do you know you have
[27:07] the Holy Ghost
[27:09] I actually listened to that tape and I
[27:11] was like saying to myself I'll just get
[27:14] some something then I'll write some few
[27:16] notes and then I found myself writing
[27:20] almost the whole thing
[27:22] and then when I was done I think I had
[27:24] two or three pages and then I called
[27:26] there I said okay now I'm ready my
[27:28] sister and then I started reading what
[27:31] the apostle was saying as I was reading
[27:33] she was aiming but when I was left with
[27:37] a half a page she was crying and I asked
[27:40] myself ah maybe she doesn't like what
[27:42] I'm saying but I continued reading and
[27:44] the time I was almost done she started
[27:47] crying my presence because she cried and
[27:50] now I didn't know what to say anymore
[27:53] because
[27:55] I kept on saying amen my sister amen you
[27:58] know what the Apostle says after the
[28:00] surface that's what I said I didn't know
[28:01] what else to say and then
[28:03] I hanged up the call and then after that
[28:06] I was thinking what just happened
[28:08] and then the thought just hit me and say
[28:10] remember you were fellowshipping about
[28:12] the Holy Ghost
[28:14] and then says if you can speak about the
[28:17] Holy Ghost and nothing happened then you
[28:19] will lie
[28:20] [Applause]
[28:27] and then I realized that actually what I
[28:31] said about the Holy Ghost it is what the
[28:33] apostle was preaching and then the same
[28:35] thing that happened on that tape
[28:37] happened when that Fellowship when I was
[28:39] fellowshipping to her
[28:44] and then as I continued fellowshipping
[28:47] with that girl there was this other day
[28:49] I posted a picture of the Apostle on my
[28:52] status and then I wrote The caption I
[28:54] said The only voice I know
[28:56] and then she replied and said what do
[28:59] you mean I called there and said that's
[29:01] what I mean it's the only voice I know
[29:03] she said to me are you saying that this
[29:06] man is God I said yeah I believe that
[29:09] this man is God
[29:11] [Applause]
[29:15] and then
[29:18] she said to me she said no no no wait
[29:20] wait from the church I am from they are
[29:23] telling me that that man is God so she
[29:26] was from zcc she was saying that man is
[29:29] God I said yeah there are many gods but
[29:32] we don't just want any other court but
[29:35] we want the core of the Bible
[29:36] [Applause]
[29:42] I said
[29:44] um you want the god of Abraham the god
[29:46] of Jacob the god of Isaac that's the god
[29:49] that we are looking for we are not just
[29:51] looking for any other God but we are
[29:53] looking for that God
[29:55] and then
[29:56] I could you took the Bible I said you
[29:59] know what let us put these two Gods on
[30:01] the test you say this man is God I said
[30:04] yeah he's God I'm saying this one is God
[30:07] but let's check which one is the god of
[30:10] the Bible
[30:12] and then I Fellowship to her I told her
[30:15] about Genesis 18 as it was in the days
[30:18] of Lords I told her about the desire of
[30:22] the court of this Bible I told them
[30:25] everything that I know about this God
[30:27] and then after some okay and then it was
[30:30] fine after some few months I think she
[30:33] was in the message there was this other
[30:34] day she was on a call with another
[30:37] sister from nelspruit he says the sister
[30:40] spoke and then she had three voices at
[30:42] the same time
[30:43] she said she was scared now she hanged
[30:46] up the call she called again she had
[30:49] three voices okay she said my sister do
[30:51] you have flu then no I don't have flu
[30:53] but he said hey what's happening now she
[30:56] hanged up the call and then she was
[30:58] sitting on his on her chair and then she
[31:00] says that as she was sitting she saw she
[31:03] saw the Apostle Pastor Jonathan and
[31:05] Pastor Julie's
[31:10] [Applause]
[31:18] and then that's where I found out that
[31:21] I that's why I found out I'm sure even
[31:25] now she knows that there are many chords
[31:28] but we have found the core of the pirate
[31:35] bless your Saints I reach all in the
[31:38] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[31:40] Jesus Christ
[31:42] there's actually a lot of
[31:45] things to say about this ministry
[31:48] uh
[31:50] not knowing where to start
[31:52] because the Lord has done so much for us
[31:54] uh just start by sharing a few
[31:57] testimonies because I'm actually in the
[32:00] University of Johannesburg
[32:03] but I'm working together with the
[32:04] brothers from Val
[32:06] and the president Justified to me is the
[32:09] brother that just spoke
[32:11] we actually come from
[32:13] a place near
[32:15] the border of Mozambique
[32:18] and
[32:19] also Swaziland the reason why we call it
[32:23] nelspade is because I believe that it's
[32:25] a place that many of you are familiar
[32:27] with
[32:28] and um but the name of the place is
[32:31] actually Gomez
[32:34] so by the grace of God in 2019
[32:38] the brother testified to me I was still
[32:40] doing metric at the time
[32:42] and I remember
[32:44] he went to University at the time
[32:47] and what really took me up by this
[32:52] ministry is that I have known this
[32:54] brother all my life
[32:56] and all of a sudden there was just
[32:59] something different about him
[33:01] I've known him all my life I knew that
[33:04] this Prada we used to do worldly things
[33:07] together
[33:08] but all of a sudden I remember it was
[33:10] during October he told me
[33:12] my brother I found a church
[33:15] and I thought to myself okay you found
[33:17] the church and said to me no but we'll
[33:19] talk when I get there
[33:20] I said no it's fine
[33:22] he came December
[33:24] I remember he started testifying to me
[33:28] and the first time I saw him he was
[33:30] there was just something different about
[33:32] him
[33:33] there was just something about him that
[33:35] I couldn't understand
[33:37] and even the way he spoke the things he
[33:39] was telling me it was things I've never
[33:41] heard before I've been reading the Bible
[33:43] but it was different
[33:45] so now I thought to myself okay this is
[33:49] new
[33:50] and at first I was a bit resistant but
[33:55] the more I spend time with him the more
[33:58] I started to change as well
[34:00] the more I spend time with him the more
[34:02] I something happened to me
[34:05] so
[34:07] by the grace of God I remember the first
[34:10] day he played to me was the mind of
[34:12] Christ
[34:14] and when the apostle was preaching the
[34:16] mind of Christ I remember
[34:18] there's this part where the Apostle says
[34:20] now lay hands on one another
[34:23] and the brother laid his hand on my head
[34:25] I laid my hand on his head I never told
[34:28] him this but it happened
[34:31] after we were done praying he removed
[34:33] his hand and there was just like the
[34:35] palm of his hand there was fire on my
[34:37] head and I said this is God
[34:40] I realized that this is God
[34:43] and since the time I came in it was 2020
[34:48] it was locked down so we couldn't come
[34:50] to church for two years I couldn't come
[34:52] to church but I was testifying it was
[34:55] just a fire in my soul
[34:57] the things that I heard
[34:59] it was just too much for me
[35:01] and I remember
[35:02] at the church that I was at I remember
[35:05] almost everyone that I got in contact
[35:06] with I told them about the things that I
[35:10] heard I remember at the time it was tips
[35:13] such as uh modern events made clear by
[35:16] prophecy I gave away my wedding comment
[35:18] it was such tips that I told them about
[35:21] that a woman is not allowed to preach it
[35:23] was the basic things things that were
[35:25] supposed to know but for me I remember
[35:28] when I took it I thought that everyone
[35:31] else is going to take it because he this
[35:33] was the truth and I had the mindset that
[35:36] the truth shall set you free I thought
[35:38] that these people were not free so let
[35:40] me go and tell them so that they can be
[35:42] free
[35:43] and by the grace of God
[35:45] uh the whole December so now another
[35:49] story the whole December I remember we
[35:51] were speaking about the apostle and I
[35:54] remember I didn't know him at the time
[35:56] I didn't I it was my first time hearing
[35:59] about this man
[36:00] but there was just something different
[36:02] about him I remember we came to one
[36:04] point we were fellowshipping with the
[36:06] brother the whole December through
[36:07] fellowshipping about revelation 22 16
[36:10] and he said that no the Apostle is the
[36:13] Angel that's what we had that's the
[36:15] first revelation that we had because the
[36:17] Apostle says you grow in Revelation so
[36:20] we were growing in Revelation you're
[36:21] getting closer and closer and closer so
[36:24] what happened was
[36:27] what happened was um what really shook
[36:30] us is that every time it Fellowship a
[36:32] brother would come in a fellowship the
[36:34] exact same things that he was speaking
[36:36] about
[36:37] so that really shook us
[36:39] but the most remarkable thing is that
[36:40] the whole December through we're
[36:42] speaking about the Apostle being the
[36:44] angel and if you remember Saints the
[36:47] 31st of December 2019 the title of the
[36:50] Apostles message was I sent my angel
[36:52] before you
[36:54] [Applause]
[37:00] so
[37:02] after that I I remember I was supposed
[37:04] to go to university and things didn't
[37:07] work out I believe that God wanted me to
[37:09] stay at home because there were other
[37:11] things that came in during the time
[37:13] testifying and mind you come from a
[37:16] place where at the time there was no
[37:18] deacons no Elders nothing it was only us
[37:21] young people but the tapes kept us alive
[37:23] and
[37:30] I I remember the
[37:33] the statement which Paul made he said
[37:36] I'm uh absent in the flesh but present
[37:40] in the spirit so I think that God was
[37:42] there because he as I said we have a lot
[37:45] of testimonies but because of time we
[37:47] can't share all of them
[37:48] so just going back a bit to what
[37:51] happened this year not very long ago it
[37:53] was last week and last of last week at
[37:55] rest there's a sister from the same rest
[37:58] that I stay at I testified to her last
[38:01] year by the grace of God she got
[38:02] baptized and she's also testifying as
[38:05] well we're winning souls for the Lord so
[38:08] what happened was
[38:10] uh last week we were because sometimes
[38:13] we come together and we have Fellowship
[38:16] so the sister came and there was another
[38:18] soul that she came with and there was
[38:20] another sister which is a message
[38:22] believer she's not in church but she's a
[38:24] message believer so I remember her
[38:26] telling me that I met this other sister
[38:28] but she's a message believer and she
[38:31] said to her that she asked her do you
[38:32] know about El Tabernacle do you know
[38:34] about the Apostle she said she doesn't
[38:36] know anything about that I said it's
[38:38] fine my sister we'll talk about it when
[38:40] we get to the fellowship so we go to the
[38:42] fellowship I remember
[38:45] um as we started fellowshipping and the
[38:48] only thing I could tell her was the
[38:51] quotes of Prada pranam where he speaks
[38:53] about 1946 was the cold weather speaks
[38:56] about that angel he says those seven
[38:58] angels are Earthly Messengers but he
[39:01] says that there's that one angel that
[39:03] will come to announce something he says
[39:05] that there's that one Angel that's gonna
[39:07] come and he's gonna announce something
[39:09] he says that angel is revelation 10. so
[39:12] I was telling the sister about that and
[39:14] as you continued speaking about taking
[39:16] out the quotes and then I started I just
[39:19] drifted I don't know what happened but I
[39:21] just found myself speaking about the
[39:23] jubility how the apostle was raised how
[39:25] he grew up the testimonies he had and
[39:28] all of a sudden uh the sister as I
[39:31] mentioned the sister from rest I won't
[39:33] mention any names but the Holy Ghost
[39:34] fell
[39:35] and she started feeling the Holy Ghost
[39:38] and I could see that the Holy Ghost is
[39:40] falling and not only that since but even
[39:43] the soul that you brought with the soul
[39:46] that she brought with God's slay even
[39:48] the message believer got slain
[39:53] [Applause]
[39:59] and since
[40:00] um even I think last week Wednesday
[40:03] uh before I came to church
[40:06] because I think that Wednesday he was
[40:09] supposed to share this testimony but due
[40:12] to change of plans we had to come today
[40:14] but even that Wednesday before I left I
[40:18] said to the sister my sister can you
[40:19] please all just come together and let's
[40:22] just have a fellowship because I won't
[40:24] be there on Thursday and Friday and she
[40:27] said it's fine my brother we came
[40:28] together and I remember we were
[40:30] fellowshipping the same thing happened
[40:32] the Holy Ghost came down again
[40:37] [Applause]
[40:42] and then now um in closing
[40:45] uh
[40:47] uh as the brother said that um
[40:50] he doesn't believe that the Apostle is
[40:52] an ordinary man
[40:53] and I'd like to say that um I remember
[40:56] when he came in the ministry he used to
[40:58] share his testimonies with me told me
[41:00] you know my brother I had a dream about
[41:01] the apostle
[41:03] but I think that with me
[41:05] and as I mentioned that I only came to
[41:07] church after two years with me I wasn't
[41:10] that much bothered with not dreaming
[41:12] about the Apostle I believe that God
[41:15] comes to all of us in a different way
[41:17] and with me there was just something
[41:21] different
[41:22] there's just this feeling that I get
[41:25] whenever I the the angel of the Lord is
[41:27] there and there's even the sister from
[41:30] nelspruit the brother mentioned about
[41:32] her that sister can attest to that I
[41:35] remember there was this one time I went
[41:36] to where she stays and we had a
[41:38] fellowship I told her my sister connect
[41:40] the angel of the Lord is here and all of
[41:42] a sudden
[41:43] the sister started feeling the angel of
[41:45] the Lord the Holy Ghost was present
[41:48] so
[41:50] the last testimony I remember there was
[41:52] this other sister I was testifying to we
[41:55] used to go to the same school together
[41:56] but I take her as my little sister and
[41:59] this sister I remember we spoke and over
[42:02] the phone he was speaking and I was
[42:04] sharing to her about
[42:05] um uh what I was listening to because we
[42:08] only had tapes and there was some
[42:10] brothers that used to Fellowship to us
[42:12] another product from secunda so I was
[42:14] listening to a tape and I remember at
[42:16] the time if my memory says me correctly
[42:19] I remember it was uh the revelation of
[42:21] Hell and its Dimensions part two and I
[42:24] remember I was sharing to the sister
[42:25] about that um tape
[42:29] and all of a sudden the sister was
[42:31] responding
[42:33] but something happened
[42:35] and as the sister there was a moment
[42:38] where the sister got silent
[42:40] and I but I could also feel that the
[42:43] Holy Ghost came and all of a sudden I
[42:44] just heard the sister Scream the Holy
[42:46] Ghost came into the room she was
[42:48] speaking over the phone so I felt that
[42:52] the Holy Ghost was present and believe
[42:54] you're saying this this was happening
[42:56] even before I got baptized I only got
[42:59] baptized in 2021 February but then it
[43:03] was still 2020 and every time it
[43:05] Fellowship the Holy Ghost would come
[43:07] down
[43:09] [Applause]
[43:14] so
[43:16] now this is the when she screamed and
[43:18] she fell down on the floor
[43:20] and as I said I was worshiping I just
[43:23] put the phone down I started worshiping
[43:26] and all of a sudden as the Holy Ghost
[43:29] began to subside
[43:31] and then the the sister came to me uh
[43:33] she came back on the phone we started
[43:35] speaking again and then she told me
[43:37] brother you won't believe what happened
[43:40] I I said to her my sister what do you
[43:42] mean she said to me
[43:44] uh something just happened
[43:46] she said to me when I screamed uh
[43:49] uh my sibling came into the room and
[43:52] asked me if I'm fine and she said uh to
[43:55] The Sibling no it's fine you can go out
[43:57] and The Sibling left the room close the
[43:59] door she said she felt as if a door was
[44:02] opening again
[44:03] and when she looked the door was closed
[44:06] and she said that the thing is with her
[44:08] door when you open it it makes a noise
[44:10] she said that she felt a presence in a
[44:13] room once you fill that presence in the
[44:15] room she said when she looked up she saw
[44:17] a light and that light changed into a
[44:20] figure and the figure was a man wearing
[44:22] a white suit and she said the man
[44:24] wearing a white suit was the Apostle at
[44:26] the hill roster

[1:32:13] when my father brought me to the apostle
[1:32:17] I had scales growing over my eyes and
[1:32:20] the doctors gave up hope
[1:32:23] I was declared blind basically
[1:32:27] so
[1:32:29] God put my family to a test and
[1:32:33] he urged my father to take me to the
[1:32:35] apostle
[1:32:37] and my father took me in the Apostle
[1:32:38] prayed for me
[1:32:40] and in that moment the scales fell from
[1:32:43] off my eyes
[1:32:48] God clearly turned my test into a
