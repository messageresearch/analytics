[Applause] Then um I don't know if you remember I don't know if you forgot we had a concert here. I don't know if you remember highly successful And the apostle says, "Looking forward for another one in 2026." In a few hours when we eat 20, he's looking forward to another one. [Applause] The sisters that cook the whole year and for the special meetings. There are people here that do things that you don't know. They slip here on the side and they cook and they move. All that you do, you eat. You don't know who they are that cooked for you. Give them a hand. Amen. [Applause] [Applause] Special meetings all over. We went, food was provided. We were in Richmond. They had food provided. Short notice, but people are on the ball. People want to do something. [Applause] Then again, this year, I don't know about you, El Tabernacle, but these media guys on the cameras, they took us to another level. I don't know if you see the clips and the videos and the preaching. It's on another level. Can we stand up and give them a hand? And the reason why I want you to stand up and give them a hand, they travel the country to record the man of God. And the reason you need to give them a hand, it's easy to buy data to look it on your coach than to travel to the real live meeting. They make it possible for you to relax and watch it at home. Give them a hand. Give them a hand. [Applause] [Music] And they're doing such a good job that every so-cal message Pentecostal is on our stream because they doing a good job.

[Applause] Then we want to thank brother Israel, brother Daniel, brother Lost, all the L tabernacle worers that work in the unseen every time to keep us going here. Can we give them a hand? Can you give them a hand? I'm out of cater out of notes but use a spoiled man. Yellow man says kabad. [Music] You need to get one of those message pastors and you'll see what it is what you have. [Music] Let's give the man on the tower a hand. [Music] It's not just running this place. Having a vision for this place every time takes a special man. [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Don't get happy for a man and run after a man here. Any man in the church. Look who anointing that man. &gt;&gt; There's a man anointing people here. [Applause] [Music] Then we want to thank the school. It's still standing. You know you here but the whole year there's people on the sides here. A school every day every year since we started the school is still here. [Applause] Not God in the prison only. God in the school. [Music] [Applause] [Music] We want to thank the principal, the vice principal, the teachers, and every worker here. They work every day to keep the school going. And you know how many made it because of this El Tabernacle. We gave up on the school, but God did not give up on. And by God's grace, we're going to open up again 2026. [Applause] You want to give the teachers a good applause. Your regret, your reward is great [Applause] from the school, the family, everyone. The school was never in a better financial place like now. [Music] Going into 2026, we were never all right with the school like now because God is in the school. &gt;&gt; Whatever this man, [Music] fruit comes. Forgive me, church, but I like the truth. And if you don't believe it, look at his fruit and worship the fruit. [Music] By the end of this year, we'll be able to give a full financial report of what God done in his school. God got a school. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember, but God's got a school. [Music] El Tabernacle. God's got to school. And both my kids made it years ago because God had a school. I don't think Edgar and Esther turned out very bad. They wouldn't have made it if God didn't have a school. Jal and Joel wouldn't have made God had a school. All the grandchildren made it because God had a school. &gt;&gt; Thanks the teachers. Thank the principal. And behind that, thank the God of the apostle. The apostle saw it through for us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [Music] through that school and everything. Be patient with Edgar Roscoll. &gt;&gt; Be patient with him. &gt;&gt; All is well on our way. We are well on our way that apostle. We want to thank King Jesus for the bonuses we gave all the workers and teachers this year. We could bless them more than any year. Everyone that is from Y tabernet the companies didn't give bonuses that most companies didn't give a year end function but God in El Tabernacle in a man in a in the leader of this blessed you though times are hard he blessed you he didn't have to do it but he did thank you king Jesus Yes, [Applause] we thank God we could some places we lifted up the bonuses by 2,000 rain. We gave more than any year in the worst time. Is God here? &gt;&gt; Are you pressing stop? &gt;&gt; But God is pressing play. That's why whoever wants to stop it will take the remote out and keep it playing. &gt;&gt; El tabernacle don't say leadership. We got leadership. And brother, the lifting up is just the natural side. How many people was lifted up spiritually this year &gt;&gt; that you can't even talk of? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then for the first time this year &gt;&gt; or in the in this year especially the people from far cleaned this place not as visitors. &gt;&gt; They slept here not as visitors. They cleaned the hostels and wherever they were the yard, the kitchen not as visitors. They told us now we are El Tabernacle. [Music] [Applause] Let's give them a hand.

I'm Rosanne Adams and tonight we're taking a look back and reflecting on the year. Now, in the 2025 World Cup Roller Fly, we saw our local team, the MBRC, make its mark with two familiar names flying high in the face of adversity. Our senior pastor, Jonathan, took to the skies with tough winds and recording a score of 54.08, showing great composure despite the unpredictable nature of the outdoor competition. And then our apostle Edah Hill scored an impressive 125.58. Even under the strong wind conditions, the Apostle's performance stood as one of the greatest representations of our region. Even under difficult weather conditions, qualifying him for recognition on the world stage. [Music] [Music] I greet you um all I'm uh my name is Edar Rosco and um I have pictures for over 20 is. [Music] [Music] Now, we witnessed the EHR79 Cup unfold across three major tournaments, and the finale produced one of the most dramatic and intense finishes. At the end of the tournament, Shooting Stars and Volcano were level on 27 points, forcing the championship to be decided by gold defense. Shooting Stars, however, claimed the title with a superior goal difference of 114, narrowly edging out volcanoes on 92 points. Gunners FC, the reigning champions from last year, successfully defended their title, finishing the season on 22 points. Closely behind were Loft House, who mounted a strong challenge throughout the tournament and ended on just two points a drift on 20 points. More than the competition, the EHR 79 Cup stood as a collective sacrifice towards the building of the Durban Church. Every match played, every point scored, and every cheer contributed to God's greater plan. Whether winning or losing on the field, we are all winners in supporting the work of the Lord. The EL1 Racing Championship delivered excitement throughout the year, but there can only be one champion. Team Aston Martin stood victoriously on the podium after speeding through their final race. In terms of individual driver standings, pastor Edgar Karosco Jr. claimed the EL1 championship title. This season was yet another proud moment for Al Tabernacle and a testament to our excellence in every arena. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Beyond Sport 2025 was rich in teaching and guiding to our tabernacle. The women's seminar provided wisdom, encouragement, and practical instruction to the ladies of eel tabernacle. While the men's camp became a place of reflection, accountability, and strengthening. Advice given during these gatherings addressed family, faith, responsibility, and purpose, leaving a lasting impact to extend beyond the year. was featured. The atmosphere was electrifying and uplifting. What a blessed and amazing day we had to tell you all. Nothing was outsourced. Our speakers, our caterers, our florists, our decor ladies, everything proudly El Tabernacle. Not forgetting El Tabernacle's Gospel Concert held by our very own mass choir and instrumental ensemble. The seasons of praise gospel concert celebrated our unchanging praise with the changing seasons. [Music] And then at the heart of 2025 was the Apostle Ed Rosco who led eel tabernacle through a powerful sequence of services throughout the year. Our 2025 year began with the sermon the mighty angel revelations 10:1 the keystone revelation. The apostle then preached at the January combined meeting the gospel trumpet has sounded part one. On the 2nd of February, we heard the apostle preaching on the bess and beard comments. The 22nd and the 23rd of February, the apostle held the Bible study on the depths of revelations 10 part 5 all the way in Penda. On the 1st of March, the apostle preached the gospel trumpet has sounded part two. During the Easter convention, the apostle has preached the bride's Easter. And on the 31st of May, the Apostle preached part two of the bride's Easter. We then heard the foolish virgin on the 29th of June. And at the funeral of our late elder, the apostle preached after the coffin. What then? On the 2nd of August, we heard the foolish virgin part two. On the 17th of August, the apostle preached in Hebron the lost anointing. And during that August combined meeting, Handlers of the Oil was preached. On the 22nd of September, Handlers of the Oil part two was preached. The greatest sermon ever preached, the prophetic insight in Matthew 25. The seventh seal was preached on the 10th of October. During the Bloomfontain services, the apostle preached on the foolish church and later that week held a question and answer session for the youth at VU during the November month. And on the 7th of December, the Apostle traveled all the way to Richmond and preached on God's journalists. And during the convention, the apostle preached on part two of the greatest sermon ever preached, the prophetic insight in Matthew 25, the seventh seal. Our apostle has gone above and beyond to ensure that our cups are running over. As we look back, it's clear that 2025 was the year of impact for eel tabernacle. impact through sport, impact through teachings, impact through music, and most importantly, impact through the Holy Ghost. And with that, the 2025 season comes to an end. This is E News Network, keeping you informed and connected. Until next time, happy new year.

Amen. &gt;&gt; So without ado, I need to do something tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. um maybe very contrary to the feeling that you are &gt;&gt; and um I'm bringing forth a confession of a murderer. I killed a man after 60 plus years. I had to make this confession tonight. I need to repent. I call it a confession of a murderer. And they will never find his body. &gt;&gt; The guy &gt;&gt; that I killed &gt;&gt; while I was 18 to 20 years old. I killed a man. &gt;&gt; This man was water in my blood. &gt;&gt; Always against me. stood in my way if I wanted to do something. &gt;&gt; Like Paul says, the copper smid. &gt;&gt; This man done me much harm. When I was a young when I was young, he was my best friend. But he made me to dishonor my parents. You know how friends go when it comes to your parents and what your parents want you to be and then they have a way to influence you to dishonor your parents &gt;&gt; and disobey your parents. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I nearly turned out a juvenile delinquent because of him. I nearly became a renegade, disobedient to my parents. [Music] When we got older, he introduced me to the wrong company. [Music] That's why I know when I see your friends, I know your company &gt;&gt; and I know who you are. He made me run after goals. I was quite a handsome young guy. I knew how to dress and I had them flocking after me. [Music] Brother Beckard asked me one time him and his wife and all those girls that was running after you. I said I kissed them all because of this friend. He introduced me to sport that never that nearly took my heart away because I nearly went to England. [Music] I doubt there was a guy that scored as many goals as what I have and my friend boosted me. He took me to the pleasures of the world and he drove me from church. [Music] And I said to myself, "So far, my friend." [Music] Then I came to a place, how can I kill this guy? [Music] I cornered him one time. I cornered him, Brother Raymond. There was no way out for him. I planned it to precision. at this place. You won't get away. I'm going to kill him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Would you like to know what corner I caught him in? &gt;&gt; It was at the altar of the Nazarene church. [Music] The guy couldn't escape. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I killed him at that altar. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you know what I done with his body? I took his body and threw it into the sea of forgetfulness. [Applause] And they couldn't find his body &gt;&gt; cuz his body is gone. His old life is gone. Christina [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Because I hated myself. &gt;&gt; Oh, wretched man that I am. &gt;&gt; Who can save me? Hallelujah. [Applause] And every time, every day, brother Raymond, &gt;&gt; he wants to jump up. &gt;&gt; And then I die daily. &gt;&gt; I kill him daily. And I was going to ask the church as you look at this man behind the pulpit, &gt;&gt; wouldn't you like to become murderers? Let us kill ourselves. and let us have a new life. Jesus Christ. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And that's my confession of a murderer. I can see all over the world. They say sh Never forget. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My confession. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, if you have your Bibles with you &gt;&gt; as you prepare to die next year, &gt;&gt; you came to die today. &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. today. to be. &gt;&gt; I never gave you that one, Edgar, because I didn't want you to steal my Hallelujah. There's no judge that can sentence me. &gt;&gt; He hasn't got a body. &gt;&gt; No judge can sentence you. Wow. I woke up two days ago and this thing came to me. I said, "Oh my god, &gt;&gt; a confession of a murderer." [Applause] [Music] [Applause] He has no good people. He has all murderers. Yeah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay, you've got your Bibles with you. &gt;&gt; We're going to turn to Matthew 25. Matthew 25 verse 10 to find it. I will read it. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. While the foolish virgin went out to buy the oil, the bridegroom came. &gt;&gt; The half an hour silence was finished. And they that were ready went in. The ones that was ready. But the bride has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; They went in. And my title is as follows. And the door was shut. &gt;&gt; I like to preach on and the door was shut. I'd like you to say with me again. &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] What a year we had last year, huh? &gt;&gt; I just want to say before going into the message, I really do not know about 2026. Amen. &gt;&gt; I try to look into it. &gt;&gt; I try to see something like normally when I come, it looks so dumb to me because 2025 was based on Trump. He had Kalansky at him. He had most of the presidents visiting him this year. He had a lot of wars that he tries to stop this year. And he hardly stops them then they go on again. He was preaching one gospel peace &gt;&gt; which is Matthew 24 &gt;&gt; war was which is Matthew 24. &gt;&gt; In the meantime he caused war somewhere else. He lifted up the taxes &gt;&gt; money fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; He remind me of that second woman &gt;&gt; in the sixth vision &gt;&gt; representing Rome. Everything he does thus far &gt;&gt; is to do with that sixth vision. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I do not know it looks so bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. that 2026 America will be 250 years old. In 2026, Israel will be 80 years in the in the promised land. Now, I hope I'm not prophesying. &gt;&gt; I'm hoping that as things look, I hope Los Angeles sink. [Music] It is about the best time &gt;&gt; to sing &gt;&gt; because you will have the World Cup &gt;&gt; in Los Angeles &gt;&gt; next year. [Music] So remember, I say I hope. &gt;&gt; And if there's anybody here that don't hope the way I hope, &gt;&gt; then I'm sure you're not ready &gt;&gt; to move. I want to say even so Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; let you go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It will be two years nearly after the 70th Jubilee. [Applause] [Music] There was a lot of cases in 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They never had such a lot of cases. &gt;&gt; Amen. indictments. &gt;&gt; And normally after the indictment come the prison &gt;&gt; sentence. &gt;&gt; Now why I say so? It's because when the door was shut &gt;&gt; in the time of Sodom, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sodom and Gomorrah &gt;&gt; had an earthquake. So friends, &gt;&gt; you don't have to even ask your pastor about a thing like this. &gt;&gt; You got two eyes and you got two ears. &gt;&gt; Why don't you start looking around? And the king of England also wants to visit 2025 &gt;&gt; America. And Trump wants to give a big bash. [Music] And normally in the Bible when Nebuchadnezzar had a big bash, &gt;&gt; the handwriting [Music] on the wall. And that's why I chose this title. &gt;&gt; And the door is shut. [Applause] [Music] When the oil stopped and there was no more oil &gt;&gt; and there was no more Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and there was no more token. Amen. &gt;&gt; These foolish virgins, &gt;&gt; they knew they didn't have oil. [Applause] [Music] The Bible says that they went out &gt;&gt; to go look for oil. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of those days say when they went out they didn't find oil. Nowhere in the Bible &gt;&gt; does it say they found oil. &gt;&gt; Now, why didn't they find oil? Is because the wise virgin bought up all the oil. [Applause] Every service she pulled up. Every service she bought oil. every service. She didn't set stone and let it pass by. She grabbed it. Every service and now there is no oil. Hey, &gt;&gt; and they ran out to try and go and find the oil. &gt;&gt; This one runs to that church and preach to that pastor. to see if he can bring oil to that church while his church hasn't got oil. How can he go to another church to bring oil and that pastor go to another pastor? They went out. Nobody goes out of El Tabernacle. We have the oil. The oil here. The oil is here. Heat. Heat. And while they running up and down to one another's churches tried to bring oil in one another's churches, the Bible says they didn't find the oil &gt;&gt; and then the Bible concludes &gt;&gt; and the doors was I don't hear you. that that same door &gt;&gt; that was shut for them &gt;&gt; was open for us. cuz the roof supposed to come Oh, love. Hallelujah. There &gt;&gt; gets locked &gt;&gt; at certain junctions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of God's time. &gt;&gt; Different times in God's thoughts, &gt;&gt; doors get shut, [Applause] gets closed, [Applause] &gt;&gt; when that door closed, &gt;&gt; God don't care. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're a pregnant woman, &gt;&gt; he kills you. &gt;&gt; God don't care if you dishonor your mother and your father. &gt;&gt; God is after you, young child. He's going to kill you. &gt;&gt; Because the door is closed. He don't care which church you belong to. If you hunted with brother Brennham and you slept with brother Brennham and your brother Brennham around every corner, if you do not have the oil, he's going to kill you. [Music] These foolish virgins was panomites. And I don't care what the pastor says. I don't care what your pastor says. It's what the Bible says and what brother Brham says. That's it. You don't have the oil, you die. The doors are shut. &gt;&gt; The first 2,000 years, God shut &gt;&gt; Noah in. Genesis 7:16, &gt;&gt; the doors were shut. &gt;&gt; 7:16, God tells Noah, "Come into the ark." That means that God was already in the ark. Does that mean if the door is shut that God is in El Tabernacle? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. The second 2,000 years the Jews rejected. The Gentiles accepted it. &gt;&gt; As God says in Acts 13:46, Paul says, "Now we turning to the Gentiles because the door for the Jews was shut and it came over to us and here we are tonight. The door was open to us. The oil came and made us walk into the door. Aren't you happy? You didn't sit outside the door. You walked into the door and behind the door Jesus was waiting for you. Come in and sap with me. Come into the wedding supper. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The third 2,000 years &gt;&gt; is Matthew 25:10. what we read &gt;&gt; after the oil, &gt;&gt; after they rejected the oil, &gt;&gt; after they knew they don't have oil, &gt;&gt; the minute they heard the voice &gt;&gt; of the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; they realized they didn't have oil. &gt;&gt; But these guys in the message, they don't even know they don't have oil. How bad are they? But when they look in El Tabernacle, they can see they don't have oil because the oil is here. I claim it. [Music] And I asked Daniel of Congo, said, "Daniel, could you take me to any place outside of Eltean? that has the oil. I'll pay your fair. &gt;&gt; And I'm saying this for over 20 years. &gt;&gt; For 20 years, nobody came up to come and show me where the oil is. But but right here. Look at the oil flowing. And the oil is coming down. The oil is coming down. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. [Applause] Hallelujah. That makes 6,000 years. [Applause] And now the door is shut. &gt;&gt; Ministers, you can be cross with me. &gt;&gt; You know I'm talking the truth. &gt;&gt; You know the door is shut. It's closed. There's no movement of the Holy Ghost. Working of the Holy Ghost is none. Nowhere to be found. &gt;&gt; You must beg the people to worship. But when the oil come down, you don't beg anybody to dance, to shout, speak in tongues. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat up here. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The other day I got a phone. I found the wrong number and um Sister Judith picked up the phone and she told me, she says, "Uh, Apostle, I feel that the Holy Spirit told me that there's a big revival coming to South Africa." I kept quiet. I didn't say anything. And she says, "Uh, what do you think, uh, Apostle I said, "Judith, you know I'm going to tell you the truth." &gt;&gt; I said, "It's finished. The door's closed." &gt;&gt; Shot. It's goodbye. &gt;&gt; Never again. Will the thunders fail the Gloria? &gt;&gt; The Gloria came with Dio Gloria Edgarco and it's still here today. It's nowhere else and it will stay here because the oil is here. And listen, &gt;&gt; God was in the ark. &gt;&gt; God was sealed. in the bride in Pentecost &gt;&gt; and the door closed to the Jews. [Music] &gt;&gt; And now Matthew 25, the groom closed the door. &gt;&gt; The doors closed. &gt;&gt; When the oil is gone, &gt;&gt; the door starts moving. &gt;&gt; And then what happened when the door is closed? Let's read St. John. &gt;&gt; Could you read it? What happened? &gt;&gt; When the door gets shut, then comes Jesus. May he come here tonight and answer your prayer. May he come here tonight and make you a murderer. May he come here tonight. May he make you a jailer. Paul a prisoner of Christ. You are prisoner of al tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Let's see the sketch. 6,000 years is up. &gt;&gt; The first 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; They walked into the ark. &gt;&gt; God was in the ark. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the door closed, God was inside &gt;&gt; and then it rained. &gt;&gt; And then it rain. &gt;&gt; Watch out. It's going to rain after tonight. You are not going to be able to sit still, stand still because it's going to rain. Only in the bride is going to rain. The wise virgin &gt;&gt; and didn't rain. &gt;&gt; The rain came down in Torance. &gt;&gt; And I heard they singing the world. &gt;&gt; I hear them singing the world. Can't you see the rain is gone? &gt;&gt; Mhm. It's dry. So dry in every church. Can't you see the rain is gone? The Holy Ghost is gone. And as it rained, you know what the rain done? The rain took the ark, the word, and lifted it up. &gt;&gt; The rain took the word and lifted it up. Oh, thank you. When when the enemy comes in like a flood, the oil, the spirit of the Lord raises you up. This is my bride. Yes, she is. You lifted up in the message. They know who you are. The oil lifted you up. And they say there's no church like your church. [Music] Hallelujah. The &gt;&gt; second 2,000 years, God seals the Gentiles. The Jews are rejected. They don't get the Holy Ghost to choose. &gt;&gt; They only get it after we finish with it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; After it finishes it work amongst the Gentiles. Then only Revelation 7:1 I saw an angel coming from the east putting a mark, the seal of God onto the 144,000, but only After El tabernacle has sucked in every book of the oil. Oh brother. Tell me. Tell me, tell me that angel of Revelation 7:1, the ceiling angel, &gt;&gt; is it the same angel that you feel here now? He's here. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Revelation 7:1, &gt;&gt; that sealing angel &gt;&gt; in Elijah and Moses &gt;&gt; seals 144,000. &gt;&gt; But in Matthew 25, that same sealing angel &gt;&gt; in Edgar Ocon will seal off the ground. I take my stand. Oh, heat, heat. We gave you the quote. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says the Holy Ghost is in the hands of the church &gt;&gt; and he gives out the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; eternal life. So I take my stand. The ceiling angel in at the rostel seals you. Keep the oil. Yeah. Keep the oil. Yeah. Keep the oil. Yeah. Heat up Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Come on, let's go. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Just go to Genesis 18. Where is the greater works, &gt;&gt; church? Where is the greater works? They don't even preach it because they no know it. And if they know it, they need to produce it. But we know it &gt;&gt; and we producing it. Oh my. [Applause] [Music] 11. [Music] &gt;&gt; I want to show you something. Yeah. You see, I'm taking my time tonight. [Music] I want to read this. Genesis 19 and verse 11. Just give us a chance. &gt;&gt; Don't forget this quote. All these years they said they think they got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost belong to Jesus. No, it belongs to us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The wise version says, "We can't give you our oil." &gt;&gt; It's not ours. &gt;&gt; I claimed it. &gt;&gt; Nothing you can do. &gt;&gt; Let's read. All two things happens here. &gt;&gt; They first &gt;&gt; smite them. &gt;&gt; They first shut the door. And when the door was shut closed, &gt;&gt; they blinded them, &gt;&gt; never to see the rapture, the oil again. &gt;&gt; Now tonight, the door is shut and they will never see and find the door, the Holy Ghost, the oil. Again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Again. [Music] &gt;&gt; You young men see that you get the oil. And now you know what happens? &gt;&gt; The children in the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. is panic stricken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They hear me preach the oil is gone and you don't have it. &gt;&gt; And the children in all these churches &gt;&gt; is shivering &gt;&gt; because they know &gt;&gt; they don't have the oil. But the children in this house &gt;&gt; cannot be panicking because a champagne epic. Champagne epic. &gt;&gt; You only lift up champagne glasses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you have victory, &gt;&gt; if you won the battle, &gt;&gt; the wise virgin won the battle. &gt;&gt; Is a champagne epic. Let me see your champagne glasses there. Hallelujah. Now, one thing about a door, &gt;&gt; a door &gt;&gt; is made to open. [Music] A doors made to open, &gt;&gt; but it's not meant to always be open. &gt;&gt; There's a time it's going to close. &gt;&gt; There was a time when the door Jesus Christ was open. &gt;&gt; Come all ye that labor and I have labor. But there is also a time when the door of longsuffering gets some close. And this is not the time for the door to open. This is the time to close the door and lock the bride inside. Are you locked in? And a door, a door has two hinges &gt;&gt; that opens and close it. &gt;&gt; If it's got what? If if it's got one hinge, &gt;&gt; then it can't &gt;&gt; open or close. &gt;&gt; If you only got the word, &gt;&gt; it can't open and close. But the Lord Jesus Christ got two hinges. Spirit and truth dynamics and &gt;&gt; former rain and rain. &gt;&gt; Former rain. &gt;&gt; Then let the door close then. Heat. Heat. Now, &gt;&gt; the door can close, but somebody can still open it, right? &gt;&gt; But a door has a lock on. &gt;&gt; And a lock needs a key. And a key is faith. &gt;&gt; And faith come by the seven thunders give you faith. Have you got the seven thunders? &gt;&gt; Then you got the key. &gt;&gt; Keep the key. [Applause] You can open the door. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you can Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My my hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] And then the bridegroom says to her, &gt;&gt; "Come in. &gt;&gt; Come in." Amen. &gt;&gt; While the door was closed to the foolish version, &gt;&gt; Revelations 4:1 says there's a door open in heaven for the bride. &gt;&gt; And a voice says, "Come up higher." Brian, &gt;&gt; El Tabernacle, &gt;&gt; come up higher. Come up higher. &gt;&gt; And yellow is a mystery. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Come in." Now, how could you go in to the wedding supper with this flesh body? &gt;&gt; That means they had a body change. [Music] &gt;&gt; Before they could go in, &gt;&gt; their body changed. You had a body change &gt;&gt; for you killed that old man &gt;&gt; and now you have a body change. &gt;&gt; Your body changed. The things you used to do, you do them no more. You had a body change. You had a body change. You don't like nice times anymore &gt;&gt; because the night times now lay behind the door. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now. Come on out. Right here in verse 10. The voice and the trumpet took place &gt;&gt; and they changed &gt;&gt; and then they went in cuz they can't go in with their bodies. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; So I show you a mystery here that the wise virgin went in. But you know, &gt;&gt; there was one of the foolish virgins that slipped in with him. &gt;&gt; She look alike &gt;&gt; in every way and she slipped in. How? Nobody knows. But she was in the wedding. Every now and then they slip in. Yeah. [Applause] And the bridegroom said to her, "Friend, &gt;&gt; what are you doing here in E Tabernacle? &gt;&gt; You didn't come from Raymond Thompson. &gt;&gt; What do you want here? We see you don't have the your Gloria garment on. &gt;&gt; Get out friends. and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave the rest of the message &gt;&gt; and the door tonight is shut. Will the pianos come? &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that needs the wedding garment? &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that needs more? [Applause] Now, let's call on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Call on him. Cuz when the door is shut, he's standing right next to you now. [Applause] You speak to him. as the oil is leaving Al tabernacle and going over to Gaza where the Jews are finishing the thing off. Let us keep the oil. [Music] I'm finished. Everybody. Come on. Come on. Oh, hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Amen. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. America. [Applause] Oh my [Applause] search me Lord. Suit.

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Awesome. [Music] [Applause] Hello. Hello. Go set. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Yes. Bless you. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Come on. [Music] Yeah. [Applause] Thanks. [Music] Thank you so much. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Lord, [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] as I finish [Music] off this meeting. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Remember, [Music] &gt;&gt; more than 20 years ago, [Music] &gt;&gt; I told you the Holy Ghost is gone. And now I come back to show you the sequence. If the Holy Ghost leaves, the door gets shut. [Music] &gt;&gt; And now the door is shut. [Applause] [Music] If that door shuts and you still a sinner, you're never going to be saved. Your day is gone. [Music] Cuz he shuts the door and you can't find the door no more. [Music] You can't even save your children's soul. [Music] The foolish virgin said a half an hour [Applause] to fill up and it didn't fill up. [Music] And then the Holy Ghost leaves them and heaven's door shuts. [Music] All these years it was just open as much as that &gt;&gt; and you could only go in like a crab like this. Now it's closed. It's gone. [Applause] But brother Oscar, what about them that's still coming? God's got his talked away that never heard the gospel. But you that hear the gospel. Goodbye. [Applause] I hope I'm wrong, but up till now I am not. [Music] And the door is shut. It's closed. We going to be able to pick up one here and one there and one there. As I said, the door Jesus is not going to be always open. [Music] He closes the door. That's why I came with that little story. [Music] A murderous confession. We can only kill ourselves and beg for mercy. You oldtimes that's been so long with us. Watch that the devil don't trick you against the ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't get too big for your boots [Music] because the door is closed. You'll never come in back again. Two years ago, we spoke on the 70th Jubilee and the church was packed with vacciners. You remember how many of them could make it? [Music] None. None. And how bad is it going to be now when the door is shut? And this is where the foolish virgin made her biggest mistake. We put it on. You're doing what you are told, foolish virgin, but not doing what's right. Your pastors told you a lot of things that's not scriptural. And you were doing what was what they told you, but you didn't do what God said. You do what your girlfriend told you, [Music] but you didn't do what is right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young girl, you're running after flesh [Music] and you don't even know it's time to drop the flesh, [Music] to kill the flesh. [Music] It's time that you search yourself [Music] before we go into this new year. [Music] A thing that I hate that I see in our tabernacle is these young children that wants to tell their parents what to do. Found a sister from Cape Town. says the child want to go home. Send the deacons over there. The child was under drugs pressing her. She must go home. Since when do we hear listen to children? When Gersian didn't listen, I kicked him out. Al tabernacle don't listen to children. [Music] Children listens to us. [Music] They do what they told from their friends, but they don't do what is right. It's time we do what is right. Search me. [Music] Oh Lord, [Music] I told a sister the other day, take your heart off your child cuz you're going to lose your soul, too. [Music] stubborn. And now it's nearly impossible for you to come back. [Music] You struggled with your boy all the years cuz you patched him up. How does he look tonight? How is he looking tonight? [Music] It's no time to patch up. Son or no son, kick him out. [Applause] If Job, Noah, Daniel had to live in this day tonight, they could only save their own souls. Can't save your children's souls. They want to go to hell. I told Gersian, "When you open your eyes, you saw me here. And when you close this eyes, you're going to find me here. [Music] You're too nice with your children because you think if you're so nice that's love. That's not love. That's compromise. Because it's your child. I don't know how many people, deacons even that was with me, that straightened out all the other people's children. When it came to theirs, they couldn't straighten them out. They left with their children and they backsliden with their children. Only thing that helps [Music] is God's word. [Music] [Applause] Search me. Stop looking at your child. Look at Jesus. If you don't act like Jesus is not worthy to be your boy. [Music] [Applause] Wouldn't [Music] you like to kill yourself tonight? [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Is there any wicked ways still to live in you? &gt;&gt; Let's kill that wicked way tonight. [Music] Let's commit suicide. [Music] [Applause] [Music] God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; And the doors [Applause] are shut. And the wise virgin says, "I cannot give you any oil. [Music] I just got enough for myself." Brother Oscar, why don't you go to the other churches and help them? I already done it. Here's the flags hanging. They didn't want it. Look at all those flags. But on every flag there's a tape. And now I cannot do it no more because the door is shut. Brother Jonathan [Music] Let me see. Amen. [Music] Search me, oh God, and all my today. [Music] Oh, save. Oh my go [Music] see the be [Music] some Bring the light in me. [Music] Amen. Set me free. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Is there anybody? [Music] It says this was for me, not for somebody next to you. Your apostle spoke to me. Is there anybody like that? [Music] Not someone else is the target. I'm the target. It was directly to my [Music] kill myself. [Music] There's people at the altar. &gt;&gt; There's people killing themselves. That way it be [Music] and [Music] Oh son. Oh God, [Music] my heart [Music] for we're going to take communion tonight. the crossing over tonight. Is there anyone that examined themselves or was it just somebody else? You felt, "No, that's not for me. Somebody else." But before we take the communion, are you examining what the man said? [Music] I beg you to ask him &gt;&gt; who was talking to us tonight. [Music] &gt;&gt; Is there a young girl that is rude to her parents? Are you examining yourself? [Music] Oh, tonight I realize God's spirit not going to strive with any man anymore. [Music] God is not going to strive anymore. You heard he strived all the time. Is there anyone here? Why are you okay? You feel okay? It's fine. [Music] You'll feel [Music] &gt;&gt; I'll be your next year then you [Music] &gt;&gt; say anybody I don't want to be a preacher tonight that expects you to worship and I don't worship when God speaks. I don't want to be like that. I want to tell you, but I'm not doing help the preacher tonight. Lord, tabernacle, it's later than what you think it is. [Applause] [Music] I believe the spirit spoke plainly tonight. It was not it was plainly speaking to us. He that has an ear, let him hear what God told you to know. [Music] Thank you. Spirit to the earth. [Music] Lord, speak to me. [Music] We are staring. [Music] I sing to you strange. [Music] Yes. [Music] So lovely. [Music] Please. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Dad, stop. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I wonder precious brother Ignatius come to read us the scripture for the communion. [Music] [Music] Amen. As we turn to our scripture, scripture, turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 11, reading from verse 23 to 34. If you have it, it reads as follows. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take it. This is my body which is broken for you. This give me remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup. When he has supper, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, it will show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore, whoever shall eat this bread and drink it this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body in the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are just, we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore my brethren, when you come together to eat tar for one another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that you come not together unto condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. We just take moment of silence as we examine ourselves. Amen. I want to ask brotherly to come and pray for the Lord's table. Amen. Amen. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you blessed savior. Father, it's with a humble heart. Father, it's with a contrite spirit, Lord, that we bow before thee this evening, Lord, we want to say thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, that we are behind the shut door, Lord Jesus. Father, for where you have kept us, Lord. Father, Lord, we want to say thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus.

Thank you Lord that we can come and break bread with thee tonight Lord. Father Lord when the world does not know Lord Jesus. Father Lord what they have missed out Lord Jesus the greatest thing that they have missed which is the Holy Ghost Lord. Father Lord tonight it is the Holy Ghost Lord that has called us to the tree of life Lord Jesus. Father, Lord, where we can have eternally suck with thee, Lord, may you bless, Lord Jesus. Father, the breaking of the bread, Lord, may you come, Lord Jesus, Father, and just Lord Jesus, make a way, Father, as we partake, Lord Jesus, of your table tonight, Lord, Father, that it will strengthen us, Lord Jesus. Father, Lord, that it will keep us, Lord. And the apostles said, Lord, Father, that it will keep us, Lord, in this day, Lord Jesus. May you bless the table, Lord. Father, Lord Jesus, as we Lord, partake, Lord, and as we've examined ourselves, Lord, that we will not partake unworthily, Lord Jesus, but Lord, that we've examined ourselves, Lord, Father, Lord Jesus, may you come and have your way now, Lord, and bless this table, we ask it in Jesus precious and mighty name with much praise and thanksgiving. Amen. And amen. Amen. We're going to start with the communion. We're going to do it rowbyrow and we request that everybody be reverent.

Oh great eternal heavenly father Lord, how can we close a champagne epic such as this tonight? Oh God, Lord, we're so thankful, heavenly father, Lord, that you brought us thus far. And we're so thankful, Lord, that you sent an angel our way, heavenly father. Lord, when we look back to 2025, we started the year with a mighty angel. And we're so thankful, Lord God, that that mighty angels could keep their doors open for El Tabernacle for us to cross over in to the higher calling this evening. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you, Lord, for an upward pool, oh God, that could pull us in through the door. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful that we could be part of you and your beautiful kingdom this evening. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you so much for the man that is the pinnacle of prophecies to the Gentile dispensation. Oh God, Lord, when we look back to 2025, we can see, Lord, that surely you've been Jehovah Gyra, the Lord our provider. Lord, you've been Jehovah Shama, the everpresent help in the time of trouble and trials. Oh God, we're so thankful, Lord, that we've seen you in different attributes and different ways throughout this year. Oh God, and we're so thankful, oh God, that in El Tabernacle, we know you as Jehovah Rosco, the manifestation of God in flesh. Lord, thank you, Lord, for coming down our way to open the way to open the door. Heavenly Father, and to call us into the beloved of the Lord. Thank you for opening the door for us, heavenly father. Lord, that we can be in the joy of the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful for everything you've done for us, Lord. And Lord, as we depart, Lord, may your spirit go and prepare the way for those that will be traveling, Lord, to our respective homes. Heavenly Father, Lord, may that same angel that started last year, that started this year, Lord God, may he go with us as he shut us into the Shakina glory, as he shut us into the Aoya of God, may that Aoya that we were shut into move heavenly father, Lord, and protect us as we leave to our respective homes, oh God. May you just bless us with safe traveling mercies. Lord, we pray Lord for our precious apostle that you'd strengthen him. Heavenly Father, like never before, Lord. We've never seen a man such as this. Heavenly Father, thank you for sending us an odd pole. Thank you for sending us a man that we can see right through the footprints of the Bible. Lord, we pray Lord that you'd restore all the virtue that has left his body. Remember our precious senior pastor Jonathan, Pastor Jude, our precious pastor Edgar Rosco Jr., Brother GL, the entire Rosco family, Lord. God, bless and undertake for them even the more, Lord. May the same fullness that dwells upon the father dwell upon each and every one of them, Lord. And just like Aaron, Lord, may it reach from the head down to the beard, heavenly father, Lord, and even down to the skirts. And may we just be filled with more of that rain that Apostle says should fall upon us, heavenly father. May it rain so much upon us until we lose trace of our flesh in the sea of forgetfulness. Lord, may you take our flesh so deep in the sea of forgetfulness until we cannot even go and take it back. Heavenly Father, thank you so much for this beautiful service. May you bless each and everyone that is here. And may we depart Lord in your shakina glory. We ask it not by might, not by power, but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the apostle in your infallible name of Jesus King God. Amen and amen. [Music] Amen.
