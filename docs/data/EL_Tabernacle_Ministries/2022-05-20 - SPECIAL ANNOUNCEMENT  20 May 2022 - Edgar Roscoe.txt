TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening out Tabernacle we um greet you um in the name of uh our precious King and savior the beautiful lovable adorable Lord Jesus Christ to know him his life eternal and uh we are only here to uphold him to please him and to do whatever he unction eyes us to do and um I greet you in his name the Lord Jesus Christ I um have uh taken it on myself to make this clip and um it is especially for Al Tabernacle I was telling the brothers I'm a concern Elder of el Tabernacle tonight this time or the season um and I feel there's a lot of people around that uh is uh totally not concerned on what's taking place in so much so that um we um we're supposed to be in a desperate mode and um I am worried because brother Brams is a lack of desperation is a lack of love and love is the Holy Ghost the angel told brother brandham so it's the lack of the Holy Ghost that's why we're not so desperate and as I said the other day I just felt that a chunk has moved over again towards Israel of the Holy Ghost and the more it leaves the less desperate we will become so we want to try and install it in you to be vigilant observant on what's going on around you so I took it on myself when I was in study on Saturday and and uh check a few things up and it just I was astonished I was really taken back to realize what is really happening in the world today it's one place is FL other place drought other place blot of places Wars and uh famine hunger people complaining about the economy money is drying up and uh it is all being SP spoken of for so many years and now it is it has caught up with us so we'd like to speak on something uh next week Thursday um on Gog and MOG what um what is that happening we used to put it so far in the future we used to speak it about it as if it's so distant but today we cannot do that because that is the thing that has rattled us supposed to have rattled us if we had to realize is what it entails so I need to tell the church what is happening and in closing I would like to say this what motivated me too is I told you that um about Co the plague is here and then I said now what's going to happen after the plague I said it's going to be climate change and now we have climate change all over and then I look at it right after climate change they were saying that they're going to stop um pumping fossil fuel and try and bring it down but n Gog and may go is struck America's pumping more Saudi Arabia is pumping more more fossil fuel is getting used and they clearly forgot about the atmospheric conditions which they laay down just like last year in October and um that is becoming worse and worse and then after that we had Russia getting up from her deep sleep for all these years and she's on the war path and that is something i' would like to just talk to the church if I can get it right to talk and show how close we are at the coming and it comes at the back of what we spoke on the Jubilee the 70th Jubilee when we expect it to happen two to four years in the making and soon after we preached that we had what we've got now after Co we have the Jubilee after Jubilee we have climate change after climate change we have the be walking ever ever bold so we would like to talk on that to see if we can help you just to wake up a little bit and the best thing to become now is to become spiritual so I took it on myself that we are going to have the Tuesday fasting for yourself Wednesday short prayer meeting we're just going to sing a song and then pray and then dismiss for the Thursday and uh the Thursday uh I like to speak to the viewers on a concerned past of e Tabernacle to an unconcerned people in the message so may God bless you and may you pray for us that God should help us uh and strengthen us to try and do whatever we want to do because the Saturday we're going to preach again thank you may God bless you
