[0:22] hallu I think I'm
[0:25] uh more in the pit than anywhere else
[0:30] I don't think there's a pastor that's uh
[0:33] so much in the poopit like uh I
[0:36] am that's why I read that
[0:40] quotation scripture where Paul says I
[0:42] labored more than them
[0:52] all and um I can't stop
[0:56] laboring I'm a workaholic Hallelujah I
[1:00] like my
[1:01] [Applause]
[1:05] job you may be
[1:16] seated
[1:19] amen I am I said I'm going to come this
[1:25] Wednesday to make this
[1:28] clip um
[1:31] about the
[1:33] quotation that brother Sol renica gave
[1:37] us and gave
[1:39] me um that he said he's
[1:43] got the
[1:44] quote where brother Brenham said um you
[1:49] receive the Holy Ghost without
[1:52] emotions and although I told him there
[1:54] is no
[1:55] quote because since
[1:58] 1979 I was was nailing this thing
[2:02] down and if and I call it the
[2:07] Cod and if had a quot you would have
[2:10] blasted me if Gideon had the quot you
[2:14] would have blasted
[2:15] me Beckett had a quote and the whole
[2:18] world went after that quote somewhere in
[2:21] the
[2:23] world would have blasted me and put that
[2:25] quote up and I told him there is no
[2:28] quote like that and then he made a
[2:31] mistake to say that no no received the
[2:36] Holy Ghost without Sensations I said
[2:39] there only
[2:40] one it says this is a Time page
[2:43] 32 and if it's that quote you don't send
[2:46] it to me I got the quote I say you don't
[2:49] have the quote you know so for all these
[2:54] years I've been nailing the thing down
[2:59] and I was shocked that he said he's got
[3:02] a quote and that's why I said I'll give
[3:04] you two weeks and one Wednesday I will
[3:07] come and say whether there is a court
[3:10] like that or whether there is not a
[3:13] court like that and I ask all the the
[3:17] brainy guys you
[3:19] know in in
[3:22] U in
[3:24] elano you know the engineers and uh
[3:30] and and and and the guys with the
[3:32] diplomas from the University you see I
[3:35] come from u a spiritual
[3:44] University and
[3:46] um we gave it two
[3:50] weeks from two we Wednesday when I had a
[3:54] confrontation with him and they've been
[3:56] searching and I asked a few pastors and
[4:00] they told me we're not even going to
[4:02] look because there's nothing like
[4:04] that you know so they just switched me
[4:08] off uh immediately we're not going to
[4:11] waste our time you know there's nothing
[4:13] like that so um finally today is two
[4:19] weeks is
[4:20] up and
[4:22] none of the brainy
[4:26] guys the university guys could find a
[4:30] quote like that so there is no quote
[4:38] like
[4:44] that and another clever
[4:47] guy in the message with us you know that
[4:52] guy very clever in school he came first
[4:55] most of the time you know and he also
[4:58] went through University
[5:00] and he says uh Pastor uh I also
[5:05] looked but I can't find
[5:08] it I said well then I was right for all
[5:12] this years since
[5:16] 1979
[5:19] so s REO was lying again he
[5:24] lied playing down he
[5:27] lied and you can see that
[5:31] hits of uh the combine I think it's
[5:36] going to 8,000 now and you know you got
[5:39] to times that by bang bang bang because
[5:42] most of them don't listen to it
[5:44] alone so are we near the time that we
[5:48] take it off because we take it off if
[5:51] the
[5:52] hits is above
[5:56] six then we take it off because then we
[5:59] know know the whole world has heard
[6:02] it so
[6:04] um I think the whole world has heard it
[6:08] and I think they're going to sit him
[6:11] flat on that one and also I can
[6:16] understand now why he sits at Will's
[6:19] church because he never danced in his
[6:21] life he never woried he never shouted he
[6:26] never
[6:28] jumped in his life I never seen him do
[6:31] that here I never saw him do it at
[6:34] Raymond's I never saw him do it in tukum
[6:38] serus the only thing he done was
[6:43] to to go against the pits went against
[6:47] my pit went against Raymond's pit went
[6:50] against tok's
[6:52] pit and then also if he feels that uh a
[6:57] minister cannot tell him anything
[7:00] then he leaves and he going sits in the
[7:02] car my wife used to get a fit for that
[7:06] thing and out in tukum I believe Georgie
[7:10] also done the same
[7:13] thing now who the heck are
[7:16] they and they know nothing sir I have
[7:21] never given a guy a
[7:23] hiding a
[7:25] spanking like I gave Sol renica
[7:29] [Music]
[7:30] he came the worst of of them all and he
[7:34] had to start
[7:36] lying you know when you when you get a
[7:38] guy in a
[7:40] corner he's either going to admit or
[7:42] he's going to lie to get out of the
[7:45] corner and I hope that Raymond Thompson
[7:47] told him that he never bought the tape
[7:49] and Ne neither the tape
[7:52] recorders you see the thing that God
[7:54] gave me in Revelations 10:8 nobody had
[7:57] it
[8:04] to think that this Mighty God kept this
[8:06] thing a secret he kept his mouth
[8:10] closed and then he revealed
[8:13] it after he broke it he revealed it to
[8:16] the prophet Revelations
[8:19] 10:7 then nobody saw
[8:22] anything it was on white granite
[8:26] rock then 2023
[8:30] he says now come on
[8:32] Edgar check that
[8:40] rock and it's still
[8:43] bursting I don't have any
[8:47] time that angel keep me busy telling you
[8:50] I'm busy some sometimes was awake I'm
[8:53] you know I am awake between 2: and 4: in
[8:56] the morning since a young man and I'm an
[8:58] old man I still wake up that time amen

[10:47] prayer line it's going to be announced
[10:50] you

[10:55] the lon law nobody can stop me not even
[10:57] Sol Rica am man he's nothing he never
[11:00] can you know he thought he stopped me
[11:03] with a
[11:05] split but here I am I'm better of than
[11:07] when he was
[11:14] here he thought he'll stop me at sao's
[11:18] funeral when he walked up out him and
[11:20] his wife as I walked towards the podium
[11:23] he walked out he thought he was going to
[11:25] stop me and I laughed Within Myself he
[11:29] said said that you know I left because I
[11:33] couldn't see the seven Thunders being
[11:35] the Seven Virtues but El
[11:37] Li he Li he walked out by Raymond maybe
[11:43] not believing the seven Thunders seven
[11:46] verges but he didn't leave Raymond
[11:49] chased him away and one of the brothers
[11:52] was in the church and he was hardly in
[11:55] his car and that brother phoned me to
[11:58] say hey man Raymond chase this guy away
[12:00] like a
[12:02] dog I said but how did he look he says
[12:05] the only way I can describe it is a dog
[12:08] with his tail between his legs that's
[12:12] how Sol can walk out of Raymond's church
[12:15] then Raymond looked and he saw this
[12:17] brother in my church sitting there then
[12:20] he says I don't even care if you're
[12:21] going to tell Edgar Rosco because I'm
[12:24] not Edgar Rosco s and you people that
[12:27] sitting here that that that that likes
[12:29] him someone walk out with
[12:32] him that's how he chased Sol away and
[12:36] then I I asked the brothers then who got
[12:38] up and walked out with
[12:41] him he says nobody not not I didn't see
[12:44] anybody walk out with him he walked out
[12:48] alone the
[12:51] professor now the professor is going to
[12:54] be taught by little boys in the message
[12:59] is going to finish him now you don't
[13:02] come up against anointed of
[13:09] God
[13:11] so that I needed to tell the church
[13:15] because I said tonight I am going to and
[13:19] um we couldn't find the tape the the
[13:22] quot and you that's going to listen to
[13:24] me on this clip right around the world
[13:27] as you all are
[13:29] listening to me anyhow you know
[13:33] yeah it's quite something
[13:40] man you all know Sol R
[13:44] Canal so he's not that guy that he keeps
[13:47] himself you know even
[13:50] I was waiting for Jonathan to be born
[13:53] for 2
[13:55] years you know and after 2 years she
[13:59] only fell
[14:01] pregnant and uh I read the book of
[14:05] Jude and I was really impressed with the
[14:09] with the book of Jude because it's the
[14:11] book before
[14:14] Revelations so I said if I get a boy I'm
[14:16] going to name his name
[14:18] Jude and Jonathan came and he was a boy
[14:22] and I was going to call his named Jude
[14:24] and so Reno went to my mother-in-law and
[14:27] said Jude means
[14:30] Judas and my mother-in-law came up
[14:33] against me and says you're not going to
[14:35] name your son
[14:38] Jude and that's why we changed judee's
[14:41] uh Jonathan's
[14:43] name uh from Jude to Jonathan because of
[14:47] Sol
[14:48] renica and then what happened was uh I
[14:52] looked at this guy and says man Edgar
[14:54] rosu don't get
[14:56] stopped I said if I get the next boy
[14:58] nobody but is going to stop
[15:07] itall I'm a hell of a station
[15:12] masterj when Jude got
[15:15] born I said welcome home
[15:19] Jude nobody stopped
[15:26] me now Jude does mean
[15:29] the other word is Judas but the main
[15:33] word for Jude is
[15:35] Judah the line of the tribe of
[15:38] Judah and here that lion is
[15:41] roaring of
[15:43] Judah in E Tabernacle and S can't take
[15:49] it can't stop a man of
[15:53] God even mingled in my family
[15:56] [Applause]
[16:04] so
[16:06] I
[16:08] am what I
[16:22] am and I'm so
[16:25] sure I mean Daniel played me a club 198
[16:31] to solica says I trust Edgar Rosa with
[16:35] My Soul it's right on
[16:38] tape but he never
[16:41] did he's a great
[16:44] Pretender that's all that he is he
[16:48] pretends
[16:50] so I thought that I was finished with
[16:53] Joe Daniels and this so I asked God I
[16:57] said Lord now I got two 2 hours in the
[16:59] morning to talk to God and I said Lord
[17:03] why every time I must do a thing like
[17:06] this so he says no this guy was
[17:10] hiding and he was the main
[17:16] culprit he say so he also has to be
[17:22] exposed I'm going to close with
[17:25] this he said to me he said yeah you
[17:29] straighten out everybody I said yeah I
[17:31] did straighten them out he says but
[17:33] nobody left the churches they still
[17:35] believe what they believe I said well I
[17:37] didn't expect them to come I said when
[17:40] after brother brandham straightened out
[17:43] everybody who came 300 of them were
[17:46] supposed to be baptized they never came
[17:49] I said Jesus Christ straightened out
[17:51] everybody yes sir and nobody came yes
[17:54] sir I said but one thing I'm going to
[17:56] tell you brother s they all worried
[17:59] after they heard they must get the Holy
[18:01] Ghost with emotions and they didn't get
[18:03] it that way they are worried because
[18:06] they don't have the token then and if
[18:09] they don't have the token they are none
[18:12] of Christ and they cannot make it and
[18:15] the Death Angel will take them if they
[18:19] don't have now how did you like
[18:23] Sunday when I brought out the
[18:27] mystery of the Holy Ghost without
[18:30] emotions right in the
[18:39] Bible that mystery was only revealed in
[18:43] E
[18:49] Tabernacle you can shout louder than
[18:51] that man

[19:11] because we got the Holy
[19:13] Ghost we got
[19:15] it and we're giving it out we don't only

[19:27] scream you remember that meeting when
[19:29] nearly everybody in the church spoke in
[19:34] tongues you
[19:40] remember WR with the Bible WR with a
[19:44] quote right with the
[19:47] spirit how can we be
