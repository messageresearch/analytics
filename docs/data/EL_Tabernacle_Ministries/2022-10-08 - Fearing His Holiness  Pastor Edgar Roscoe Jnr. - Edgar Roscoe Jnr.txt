========================================
fearing his Holiness and for subject I am a jealous God that God was in his loneliness he could only look at himself he had no comparison he had no one to compare himself with he couldn't look at any other person but himself he had to look Beyond everything else he had to search high and low but when he came to that place there was nothing that compared to the Holiness that he was and God had to look at himself God himself is holiness God is the very core of his own existence he's a jealous God and his name is jealous when they said validity's quote he's no there's no hope like that quote don't kill for worship don't kill God because if you fight god with worship you will die I'm a jealous God I want you to say I'm holy holy holy holy [Music]
