[5:07] go to forsake his
[5:12] family forsake his
[5:16] children he was prepared to lay himself
[5:19] and stand in the
[5:22] Gap says he was many miles away from
[5:25] your

[6:24] over it say ever since that day I'm a
[6:28] perfect Norm
[6:32] person sister Bram I want to tell you
[6:34] these
[6:35] words it would never have
[6:39] happened if your husband wasn't

[8:32] time he came home and his own own child
[8:36] didn't even know him when he knocked on

[8:49] father praise
[8:52] God what can we say words fail us
[8:56] tonight I'm a witness I like to give
[8:59] Witness what happened in Cape
[9:01] Town as we drove down to brother
[9:03] Layman's
[9:06] funeral tired and we as we got
[9:11] there and there are so many
[9:14] ministers and they gave each Minister a
[9:16] chance to say
[9:18] something there was all the Pentecostal
[9:22] ministers each of them got up and
[9:24] identified themselves and gave all the
[9:27] titles and who they were
[9:30] and what the churches was under them as
[9:33] he went from minister to minister
[9:36] eventually came to the ministers in the
[9:38] message and there were all the ministers
[9:41] and they got up and each one said each
[9:43] thing but there was just no
[9:48] fear some ministers got up and said some
[9:51] nasty things and Tred to stick the
[9:56] pastor I said there since God
[10:01] I've seen you anointing so many times
[10:05] Lord I've seen God with the seems like
[10:09] the the other was against him I see you
[10:12] anointing him
[10:16] Lord and it came to the time where the
[10:18] pastor had to
[10:20] speak brother I never seen something
[10:23] like that in all my
[10:25] life each M had 10 minutes to speak
[10:30] and the pastor came and he ripped out
[10:32] the
[10:33] mic and he says praise
[10:37] God he
[10:40] says Pastor
[10:42] OS he says I come from Jesus
[10:46] Christ praise
[10:48] God it says I got no church but his
[10:52] church and brother when he spoke the
[10:55] anointing of God dropped
[10:57] on praise God in the face of the critics
[11:00] in the face of all the forers in the
[11:03] face of all the HS against him brother

[11:48] God I think I believe from tonight on we
[11:52] know it's the truth it's the first time

[11:56] tonight and I believe from tonight we
[11:59] we're going to pray more for him we
[12:01] believe as his body is tired and weary
[12:06] and the eggs begin to come in the body
[12:08] we're going to be like Moses when he got
[12:10] tired to lift up his hands in prayer and
[12:14] pray for him every morning you get up
[12:16] you remember the pastor's name every
[12:19] morning you get up you call upon his
[12:21] family's name you pray for them and say
[12:24] God give him new Strength God give him a
[12:27] new charge God restore Health God give
[12:30] him a new burst of faith and strength

[15:16] watch brother and sister when that
[15:18] church becomes one and the Revelation
[15:21] becomes one among them like the day of
[15:24] Pentecost when they were in one Accord
[15:26] it says the power of almighty God will
[15:29] drop down and signs wonders and miracles
[15:32] we see it but you're going to see it in
[15:34] a bigger scale brother if we dedicate
[15:37] Our Lives to him don't you love him
[15:39] tonight don't you want to say Lord I
[15:41] Surrender tonight praise God let us
[15:44] stand to our feet praise God there's
[15:46] some uh quotes I wanted to read but
[15:49] praise God everything has been said what
[15:51] can you say brother after such a meeting
[15:54] what can you say to know that Mark 14
[15:57] the Bible says she did she did
[15:59] everything she could
[16:01] do praise God and I believe we're going
[16:04] to do everything we can do from tonight
[16:07] on we're going to pray like never before
[16:10] we're going to be sincere we're going to
[16:12] do everything the Bible says he did
[16:14] everything she could do and that was to
[16:17] anoint her master and you have it in
[16:20] your power tonight to do everything I
[16:22] don't care what is on your job at home
[16:25] at school you do everything that you can
[16:29] for the master tonight and the Bible
[16:31] says that he was pleased with what he
[16:34] did and I believe God is pleased with
[16:38] what has been done in this church praise
[16:41] God As we sing I surrender all tonight
[16:44] your head bow your eye Clos Lord I
[16:47] surrender all tonight just before we go

[16:52] to surrender my
[16:54] life I want to dedicate it I want to
[16:56] anoint your head tonight God praise God
[16:59] lord I want to I want to anoint it God I
[17:02] want to break the alabaster box tonight
[17:05] God and let the anointing of God flow
[17:09] tonight Lord
[17:12] Jesus we can say like Paul says time
[17:15] fails us to tell
[17:16] about B and all the Great Men of old and
[17:21] I believe time would fail us
[17:24] tonight if we would say and speak
[17:29] about the things that God has done in
[17:31] the ministry of our precious Pastor time
[17:34] would fail
[17:38] us but we want to show more appreciation
[17:41] from our
[17:42] sides more
[17:51] respect praise
[17:54] good so
[17:57] um I was uh
[18:02] told by a young
[18:05] preacher some time
[18:09] ago um what did
[18:13] you all the guys
[18:16] left for us what Legacy did you leave
[18:20] for
[18:22] us and he mentioned
[18:26] U brother becket's name and my name
[18:32] especially and
[18:34] um he
[18:37] um then went on to
[18:40] say all that you guys has left
[18:44] us is
[18:47] fighting and
[18:50] jealousy and bad mouthing one
[18:55] another and you had unkind words all the
[19:00] time against one
[19:02] another and to him it seemed as
[19:06] if this message started that
[19:09] way and that is what we all the brothers
[19:13] has left
[19:15] behind and that made me play this
[19:18] tape because if you listen to this
[19:22] tape here's Raymond Thompson for
[19:25] instance we can play you a tape of Solen
[19:28] and what he says
[19:30] to and it wasn't
[19:33] all dark and Gloom and uh fighting and
[19:38] fussing
[19:40] and at the beginning when we started we
[19:46] were actually watching one another's
[19:49] back way back there we were
[19:54] one in spirit truth
[19:59] way back
[20:01] there so young
[20:03] man if you think that we
[20:08] started with what you call backbiting
[20:12] and fighting and being jealous of one
[20:15] another and had unkind words I played
[20:21] you this tape to show
[20:23] you that at the beginning there was no
[20:25] unkind words on this tape there's no
[20:27] unkind words words on this St there is
[20:31] no
[20:33] ugliness and that was way back there
[20:36] when we
[20:37] started and that's the
[20:39] way it
[20:41] was so I thought I'm going to play the
[20:46] tape um to
[20:50] show these young men or young preachers
[20:54] that has come
[20:55] in it wasn't all the time
[20:59] Doom and Gloom and and bad mouthing we
[21:04] used to have conventions and we all go
[21:07] went to the convention and will
[21:11] convention we were there when uh brother
[21:15] Layman down in Cape Town had conventions
[21:18] we were there when we had conventions
[21:20] out in de Gloria we were there and uh I
[21:25] will admit that
[21:27] afterwards uh things happened
[21:31] and maybe up till now we still have that
[21:36] animosity and fighting and uh because
[21:39] everyone went with with his little
[21:41] Doctrine you know
[21:45] uh we had the peruja doctrine with
[21:49] brother Billy and brother Harold Beckett
[21:52] and uh then we had uh brother Raymond
[21:55] and them and myself with a seventh
[21:57] underd Doctrine and all that but um then
[22:01] afterwards we found out the brother
[22:03] Brenham didn't see a thing like for
[22:06] instance
[22:08] um would say you receive the Holy Ghost
[22:11] without emotions and all that I wanted
[22:15] all the years is to see those
[22:18] words come out of brother brenham's
[22:21] mouth then I believe it but that's not a
[22:25] quote that's not what brother Bram says
[22:27] the same with the thund not so there's
[22:30] where the the the problem started and we
[22:32] started to break up and we had um our
[22:36] scages and uh people didn't greet one
[22:39] another and we don't visit one another's
[22:42] churches and uh because uh I think we
[22:46] got to a place where we were scared we
[22:49] going to lose members well I would say I
[22:52] thought that I wouldn't like to lose
[22:54] more members at that time but uh at
[22:59] before all these doctrines came we
[23:03] didn't have my
[23:05] brother all these fightings and stuff
[23:07] that you see so we left a legacy even
[23:11] our Legacy if I look at you then I ask
[23:13] myself how did you come in here you in
[23:16] the message what Legacy are you leaving
[23:20] have you done
[23:22] anything we were on fire for God we had
[23:26] Fellowship right through the night
[23:30] and uh you don't even have that anymore
[23:34] so uh we
[23:38] U we thought that we would um play this
[23:44] tape um so that you could
[23:48] um
[23:50] understand that when this message
[23:54] started we didn't
[23:56] have what we have today
[24:00] day uh we gave one
[24:04] another
[24:06] accolades like on the tap you heard
[24:09] brother Raymond giving out
[24:12] accolades he
[24:15] was we had conventions
[24:19] together and um we covered one another's
[24:24] backs we move freely to one another's
[24:27] churches if they were was other the
[24:29] churches and um even way back there with
[24:34] brother Beckett was in Joba before we
[24:37] went to Cape Town also we all were
[24:39] together so uh we don't um fight all the
[24:46] way from the beginning the fighting only
[24:49] started afterwards so I play the St to
[24:53] show you what happened way back there
[24:55] and um even the statements that brother
[24:58] Raymond made I'm sure there States out
[25:00] there too that I made statements about
[25:02] brother Beckett being my friend that's
[25:05] why he has in his um study there's
[25:10] nothing like old friends and I can tell
[25:13] you if I phone him uh all these years
[25:17] although we had our differences we still
[25:19] get together and have something to eat
[25:23] with his wife and what have you and we
[25:26] respect one another you know we have our
[25:29] differences so brother don't come with
[25:32] your own ideas
[25:35] about we leaving a legacy like that we
[25:42] didn't leave a legacy like that that's
[25:45] why I know that right now you know like
[25:49] u a certain prominent brother told me
[25:51] what's happening in the states there
[25:52] more people leaving the message than in
[25:54] the message I know things are very
[25:57] critical I know things are very
[25:59] bad but uh it wasn't so way back there
[26:04] so uh I hope that you would uh uh listen
[26:10] carefully how we covered one another's
[26:13] backs may God bless you and
[26:17] uh um maybe you could if you
[26:21] have an opportunity or a
[26:24] chance to uh thank brother Raymond for
[26:28] that
[26:30] accolades that he gave out on the stap
[26:34] may God bless you and there's nothing
[26:37] negative on the St thank you
