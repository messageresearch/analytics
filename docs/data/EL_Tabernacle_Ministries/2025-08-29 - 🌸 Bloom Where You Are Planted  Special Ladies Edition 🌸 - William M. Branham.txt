TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Where flowers bloom, so do hope. Good evening, saints, and special greetings to all the beautiful ladies of our tabernacle. We recently celebrated our woman's day in Christ Jesus. The team bloom where you are planted was featured. The atmosphere was electrifying and uplifting. What a blessed and amazing day we had. to tell you all nothing was outsourced. Our speakers, our caterers, our floristers, our decor ladies, everything proudly L tabernacle and we have received positive feedbacks from the sisters who attended. But now we have an an important announcement. With the woman month, women's month closing up, the apostle has thought it wise and requested that the book titled Just for the Ladies by Brother Brennan be made available to the L Tabernacle ladies. We want to share a few insights and on how this book can be a blessing to you to each one of you. And we have our dear loving sister Abigail here with us to elaborate on a few questions. Thank you for joining us sister Abigail. You're welcome sister. &gt;&gt; Sister Abigail um what are some of the insights as to how this book can help the sisters and what is the what is it that the apostle would like the sister to take from this book? &gt;&gt; Good evening everybody. Um, I think I need to start off with to say where this book originated from. Sister Rosco had a copy of this book and somehow it just got missing and God purposed it so that sister Joanie found a copy of the same book in the US and she gave it to us a couple of years ago. So when the seminar came up and um I saw the answers that the apostle gave it just pointed back to the book. So the apostle has twigged it a bit and we would like every sister to have a copy of it. So the book is based on questions that our precious uh prophet was asked and how he answered them. But it's targeted mainly to the ladies, the sisters. And it is in line with our doctrine, our belief, with many um scriptures added to the questions and the answers. And then the apostle what he wants us to take out of the book is the there's a lot of questions that the uh prophet answers by saying uh he doesn't have scripture to prove what he is saying but you need to make sure that your um your objective and your motives are right in anything you do as a Christian. So that's the main focus the apostle wants us to take because so many of the questions we receive the apostle doesn't really have scriptures for it but it is a matter of staying away from sin then coming closer to sin. So that's the main objective and then I think it is for us to bloom where we are planted. Beautiful. We're looking forward to it. Um just another question instead. Um what are some of the nuggets in the book that the ladies can look forward to to reading? Well, not to give a lot away. I think the book covers a lot covers how to be a good wife, a good mom. It covers a lot on dress code. It even covers on having unbelieving husbands. So I think there is so much nuggets for each one. It depends what applies to your life. So it applies for young and old and I think I will keep my nuggets to myself for you to enjoy your nuggets out of the book. So does that mean because I wanted to ask you on a personal note, what are the key concepts you personally enjoyed in this book? &gt;&gt; Well, for me I enjoyed the ending and the beginning of the book. the ending because um it speaks about menopause and that's what I'm going through now Mles unfortunately and I enjoyed the testimony that Rebecca Brandon gave that what her mom went through and I'd never known about that. I've read a lot of uh brother Brandon speaking on Wright's uh sister that was going through menopause. So to me that had a bit of a personal impact and I didn't realize that so many sisters went through the prayer line where the prophet prayed for them and I think the the nice part that Rebecca says her dad told her that her mom will be better off after this. So I'm looking forward to that part of being better off. And then I think it's the beginning of the book where they have a nice quotation where the prophet speaks about his wife and just to see how kind and gentle and loving the prophet was towards his wife. And he even says she's getting old now. But I love her the way I loved her back then. So that was remarkable for me because the prophet is always seen as somebody that was illuminated and to see the soft part when it comes to the sisters was remarkable. It just shows me how the apostle feels about us that he has a soft part when it comes to the sisters and how they get treated. So I think it's a good read and a mustave because everybody will be able to get something out of it. Oh, amen. Thank you so much, Sister Abby. As you all heard, this is a must readad and we want to thank you for your input and insight into the groups. There we have it, ladies. We really do appreciate our apostle, the leadership, the love they have for us and the care. Sisters, with all the wisdom that has been shared and will be shared by reading this book, don't miss out. Go and grab your copy. I think it will be a available at the combine titled just for the ladies. Be sure to get one. Thank you so much. God bless you. See you in the library. &gt;&gt; Bye &gt;&gt; bye.
