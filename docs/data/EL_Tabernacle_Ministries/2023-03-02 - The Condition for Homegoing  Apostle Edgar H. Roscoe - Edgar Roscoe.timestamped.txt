[0:00] at midnight
[0:02] [Music]
[0:06] not evening time
[0:10] midnight
[0:14] because just after midnight
[0:17] [Music]
[0:20] it will be
[0:22] [Music]
[0:24] the dawn is praying Murray
[0:30] and When the Dawn breaks
[0:33] the son of righteousness
[0:35] [Applause]
[0:37] The Pride grew
[0:41] supposed to come
[0:43] [Applause]
[0:44] the condition
[0:47] for homegoing
[0:53] the condition to meet the bridegroom
[0:56] at his coming
[0:59] I think it's the most important thing
[1:04] right now
[1:07] there is nothing more important
[1:12] for you and me
[1:15] to get ready to meet the bridegroom
[1:18] [Applause]
[1:20] because the seven voices then will be in
[1:24] the wise virgin
[1:27] the voice of Paul the voice of Uranus
[1:30] the voice of Martin the voice of Columba
[1:34] the voice of whistling the voice of
[1:36] Luther the voice of Malachi 4 will all
[1:39] be in the wise version
[1:42] they will call the brothers they with us
[1:45] us cannot be made perfect
[1:51] [Applause]
[1:53] as long as the vessel is
[1:55] they have their lamps full of oil
[1:58] but they had a vessel
[2:00] [Music]
[2:03] and that Passover
[2:06] is a man
[2:08] [Applause]
[2:10] [Music]
[2:19] when
[2:20] it goes just a little dummy and ultimate
[2:24] and that vessel said Johnny I want to go
[2:27] out
[2:29] and that vessel come
[2:32] and he falls up the line
[2:34] [Applause]
[2:35] [Music]
[2:39] vessel goals whether it's Brazil whether
[2:42] it's England whether it's Colombia
[2:45] whether it's Canada whether it's America
[2:47] whether it's up Africa whether it's
[2:50] England wherever that vessel goes amen
[2:54] the Holy Ghost Falls amen with each turn
[2:57] of dead in brother from the of that
[3:00] church amen The Vessel will bring the
[3:03] oil until the people will dance in the
[3:06] spirit because that vessel is full of
[3:10] oil wherever he goes as a burning in his
[3:14] heart burn burn Holy Spirit burning me
[3:18] foreign
[3:20] [Applause]
