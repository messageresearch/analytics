[4:39] oh it's nice to meet Mr Rosco and and
[4:41] the and both the nice so this place is
[4:44] blessed already amen it was worth a
[4:48] while to
[4:49] come and you can see the Sun is up and
[4:52] it's
[4:53] shining and we can really already feel
[4:57] that this is going to be a blessing and
[4:59] and God's is really really once again
[5:02] proving that he's in our church making
[5:05] the work of the Lord go forward we
[5:08] realize that lot is still to be done but
[5:12] we see what has been done is quite a m
[5:16] and a blessing to us we're looking
[5:18] forward for the weeks
[5:24] ahead I'm so glad to uh stand here with
[5:27] the cuz it's only the parking area
[5:30] the church will be on top here and uh
[5:34] just the the parking area here and the
[5:37] colums it's going to go up we by Friday
[5:41] for the deck and uh then we'll make a
[5:46] preparation for the
[5:49] deck and um we are we have discuss while
[5:54] being down
[5:56] here how we're going to cover the the
[5:59] money for the deck we were a little out
[6:02] on on price when we told the church it's
[6:05] actually double that amount that chis
[6:08] gave us but uh we think that God is
[6:12] going to help us to cover it so I think
[6:15] we will be covered uh until the deck you
[6:19] know as far as the money is concerned
[6:22] and then after that is uh the bricks to
[6:26] build the sanctuary on top of this so uh
[6:31] it's going um
[6:33] towards um our plans the way we wanted
[6:37] it and uh and the weeks to come is going
[6:40] to be very interesting because then
[6:43] we're going to start uh with a deck and
[6:47] uh from there it's just uh brick on
[6:50] brick for 2 m for the sanctuary and uh
[6:54] we have to come down again when the deck
[6:57] is thrown to actually
[7:00] um speak about the sanctuary there's few
[7:03] things that we need to take out to
[7:06] actually enlarge the the sanctuary so we
[7:11] we are very pleased that we could come
[7:13] down at this juncture and uh we really
[7:18] uh
[7:19] excited because uh we can see the hand
[7:23] of the Lord moving and you know brother
[7:26] sister we see a little dust fly from off
[7:30] the mountain know that the mountain is
[7:32] going to move so this is more than a
[7:34] little dust that is um flown from this
[7:39] mountain so uh that makes us
[7:42] so um so happy and uh
[7:46] inspiring so uh we urge you to please uh
[7:52] you know after the the deck is the
[7:55] bricks so we want to really ask the
[7:59] people to really dig in a pocket so that
[8:02] we can cover the bricks and then once we
[8:06] cover the bricks and we can see the end
[8:08] of this whole thing thank
[8:11] you I am so honored and blessed to be in
[8:14] the turb and Al have

[8:26] sanctury it's just something to see the
[8:29] water it's Bor in and as the Bible says
[8:33] there is no vision the people perish so
[8:36] I believe the man of God's
[8:39] Vision looking forward to what's going
