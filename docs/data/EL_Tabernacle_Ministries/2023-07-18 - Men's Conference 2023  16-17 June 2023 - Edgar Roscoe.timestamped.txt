[0:31] Lord we thank you for this morning
[0:34] thank you for this two days that you've
[0:37] given us

[0:46] this Memorial occasion

[1:00] we have true leadership in our church
[1:04] [Applause]
[1:06] [Music]
[1:08] princess the Lord in

[1:14] and we won't forget to give you the
[1:16] praise the honor and the glory for great
[1:18] things that was done

[1:30] [Music]
[1:46] [Music]
[1:50] amen
[1:52] you may be seated
[1:57] we thank God for these two weekends that
[2:01] we've had
[2:02] with the mothers in the
[2:06] daughters and
[2:08] by coincidence the trusses wanted this
[2:11] weekend for the fathers and the sons
[2:14] and the fathers and the sons has been
[2:16] here
[2:18] did you just have a good time
[2:20] [Applause]
[2:27] it's so ironic that tomorrow's Father's
[2:30] Day
[2:31] and the fathers could be with their
[2:34] little ones enjoying things around God
[2:37] Amen
[2:39] what we would like to sow to you to this
[2:42] morning is the two core
[2:46] building blocks of what we believe
[2:51] and what we believe is what you should
[2:55] know
[2:56] and what you should teach your son
[3:00] what else what else Tabernacle in the
[3:03] message of the hour is all about
[3:06] and to say how to put it into the world
[3:10] and what I'm going to sow to you from
[3:13] God's apostle
[3:14] you'll be able to get the pamphlet of it
[3:17] and
[3:18] you'll go through it so that
[3:22] you can relate to it
[3:26] be able to tell your child about it and
[3:29] when your child
[3:30] faces the world and they know what to
[3:33] answer on what we believe
[3:39] and you might say I have a clue what it
[3:43] is but it's good to put it in the world
[3:45] and know what is our belief system
[3:48] everybody has a belief system out there
[3:51] and when you approach them they give it
[3:53] to you this is it and they give you the
[3:56] scriptures
[3:57] and this is what we want to do
[4:00] and the first thing that we'll start off
[4:02] with is the life story of a prophet
[4:06] William Mary and Brenham
[4:09] and you need to know everything about
[4:11] him because you're in the message of the
[4:13] hour
[4:15] and
[4:17] the name of his father was if somebody
[4:19] must ask you what was his father's name
[4:22] you can turn around and say his father's
[4:25] name was Charles Branham
[4:27] because you're in the the message of the
[4:30] hour you ought to know who brother
[4:32] Brian's father was
[4:34] amen
[4:37] who knew that
[4:40] or didn't know that
[4:44] amen it's quite a lot of new people in
[4:47] the church
[4:49] and we need to give you this so that you
[4:52] can go through it so that you can know
[4:55] how to answer amen
[4:57] and the name of his mother does anybody
[5:00] know
[5:02] that if you don't know put up your hand
[5:06] see a lot of yous don't know amen
[5:08] mother's name was Ella Branham
[5:13] the place of birth was Boxville Kentucky
[5:15] in the United States
[5:19] in bucks for Kentucky
[5:22] in the United States
[5:25] I don't know about the Doma knew that
[5:27] but that's actually where he was born
[5:29] amen
[5:32] amen the Apostle we we need to have the
[5:38] answer because we believe that God sent
[5:40] a messenger
[5:42] in this hour amen
[5:49] he was born in a log cabin
[5:52] and his grandmother was the midwife
[5:58] you didn't know that so this is the core
[6:01] things of what God did through the man
[6:04] that he sent
[6:06] amen
[6:08] his grandmother was the middle wife
[6:14] when he was born his mother says The
[6:16] Light Came whirling in and hung over his
[6:19] bed
[6:20] and when his father opened
[6:22] and his father opened the door to the
[6:24] cabin
[6:25] so there was something Supernatural at
[6:28] his birth
[6:29] and he was born in a lock cabin a wooden
[6:33] cabin amen
[6:35] so that was
[6:37] how the prophet of God arrived
[6:41] and that's where he was born
[6:44] then
[6:45] the question comes in when somebody asks
[6:48] you why a prophet
[6:51] why a prophet why do you say
[6:54] why a prophet
[6:56] the scripture goes on and you will have
[6:59] it on the spam flute I don't know if you
[7:01] have it already
[7:03] it says here be all out saying to Elijah
[7:09] the prophet
[7:11] he doesn't say I'll send you Elijah but
[7:14] he'll send you Elijah
[7:16] the prophet that's why it's a prophet
[7:19] because the Bible says I'll send you
[7:22] Elijah and he'll be a prophet before the
[7:26] great and Dreadful day of the Lord so
[7:28] just before that Dreadful day of the
[7:30] Lord
[7:31] that's why we believe he's a prophet
[7:34] he wants to say program is a prophet the
[7:36] Bible says
[7:38] you'll be a prophet and that's why we
[7:41] need to know this
[7:43] and that's why you need to teach your
[7:44] child and tell everybody that's why God
[7:47] sent a prophet
[7:49] and he will turn the hearts of the
[7:51] fathers to the children and the hearts
[7:53] of the children to their fathers lest I
[7:55] come and smite the Earth with the curse
[7:58] Revelation stands seven why a prophet
[8:00] and in the days of the voice of the
[8:03] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[8:05] sound the mystery of God should be
[8:08] finished as he has declared to his
[8:10] servants
[8:11] the prophets
[8:13] that's why we say it's a prophet because
[8:17] he will Revelation stances he will
[8:20] reveal it to his servant
[8:22] and that's why we say this was our
[8:25] Prophet do you believe he was our
[8:26] prophet
[8:32] but on here we are told in Amos 3 7
[8:37] surely the Lord will do nothing
[8:40] God will do nothing
[8:44] but revealeth his secret to his servants
[8:48] the prophets
[8:49] so in this hour God would have done
[8:52] nothing unless he sent us
[8:55] Malachi 4 that's why we say Prophet
[8:58] because he will do nothing unless he
[9:02] reveals it to his servants the prophet
[9:05] as he revealed it
[9:14] God promised that before he destroys the
[9:16] Earth he will send Elijah the prophet as
[9:19] per Malachi form so before he destroys
[9:22] the world he'll send an answer before he
[9:24] destroys it
[9:26] thus Prophet will be the seventh church
[9:28] as Messenger to the leotician church age
[9:31] he was sent to reveal the misery of God
[9:34] then seven Revelations tell you and it
[9:37] says here in Amos 3 7 God cannot do
[9:40] anything without revealing his secrets
[9:43] to his prophet
[9:45] so when you're out there you're the
[9:46] university wherever this is why we say
[9:49] prophet
[9:51] that's why we believe in the message of
[9:53] the hour because it's Bible amen
[10:03] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[10:06] it be at the end time when the son of
[10:08] man shall be revealed that's what Jesus
[10:11] is it will be the same and if this is
[10:14] the days of Noah it is exactly what has
[10:17] taken place
[10:19] and that's what we need to know as young
[10:22] people as new converts as old people and
[10:26] to let our sons and our daughters be
[10:28] indoctrinated with what our core
[10:30] doctrines and why we say that
[10:34] amen
[10:38] in Matthew 17 10 down to 13 the
[10:41] disciples acquired of Elijah should
[10:43] still come Jesus affirmed that he has
[10:46] already come
[10:49] a lot of people believe he's still
[10:51] coming but we can surely say he has
[10:54] already come
[11:01] and they knew him not but surely he will
[11:05] come again to restore all things but the
[11:07] brother by Jesus is they knew they
[11:09] didn't know the first that Elijah John
[11:12] and he will surely come again
[11:15] and if I didn't know that one they will
[11:17] know this one
[11:19] and he will restore all things
[11:22] and we know that the spirit of the
[11:24] Prophet Elijah manifested five times
[11:27] according to the scripture so it
[11:30] manifests that five times that's why
[11:33] it's a prophet because God manifested it
[11:36] five times
[11:39] Elijah the prophet who could shut
[11:42] heavens and it reigned not open it again
[11:45] so it could rain
[11:48] Elisha who received the double portion
[11:51] of Elisha's spirit
[11:55] John the Baptist the third Elijah one
[11:58] that came and they knew him not as Jesus
[12:02] responds to his disciples
[12:05] then Elijah
[12:07] I mean William Branham one that Jesus
[12:10] referred to must restore all things
[12:12] before the Dreadful day of the Lord
[12:15] did this happen
[12:19] do you know why he came because it was
[12:22] said he is going to do these things
[12:24] so God's supposedly showing us we are in
[12:29] the word of God and we ought to know
[12:31] these things
[12:34] as preachers we ought to know we don't
[12:36] just say the prophet said it was in the
[12:38] Bible to say that these things will
[12:41] happen and it has already happened but
[12:43] we need to let our children and these
[12:46] young converts know why we say these
[12:49] things
[12:55] thank you
[12:58] and we got to tell our children our sons
[13:01] and our daughters this is why we come to
[13:03] El Tabernacle
[13:05] it's not just because we believe it's
[13:07] why we believe this because God said so
[13:13] then Elijah will return with Moses to
[13:16] preach to Israel during the tribulation
[13:19] period we should let them know the
[13:22] Elijah will come back
[13:23] after we go he'll be back here
[13:26] so Elijah will come how many times
[13:30] sorry
[13:32] okay so you still what what what we are
[13:36] trying to say here to you today he will
[13:38] come
[13:39] five times
[13:41] God said no Prophet to reveal the
[13:43] miseries of God call out a bride from
[13:46] the church as it happened
[13:50] God's Prophet is God's mouthpiece
[13:55] and as it was in the days of Noah this
[13:58] Prophet was sent to warn people before
[14:00] the oncoming judgment warning before
[14:04] judgment that's why it's a prophet
[14:08] and we need to know why a prophet amen
[14:22] let's give the Lord another hand amen
[14:37] do you love your son
[14:40] and does the son love the father
[14:43] and if you do
[14:46] make sure they know why they are
[14:50] and this is what we're trying to show
[14:52] why we believe things amen
[14:55] then the next thing that we want to lay
[14:58] down for you people this morning it's
[15:01] the life story of the Lord Jesus Christ
[15:03] do you know this man
[15:05] Jesus king God
[15:07] I don't know do you know do you know him
[15:15] if you're in El Tabernacle you ought to
[15:17] know him
[15:19] and you ought to know his life story and
[15:22] why and who he is
[15:25] and
[15:27] we also need to know the date of birth
[15:30] when he was born
[15:33] so when the they come and they ask you
[15:36] when was Jesus born you need it
[15:39] to know when he was born when was he
[15:42] born
[15:49] amen
[15:51] amen we agree we agree with you young
[15:54] men in a way to agree but why we have
[15:58] this is to show those young men when he
[16:00] was born
[16:02] and God has got leadership to tell us in
[16:06] this setting that each one must be on
[16:09] the same page to know in the Bible why
[16:12] he was born and when he was born
[16:15] Jesus was the Lamb of God
[16:18] and he was born in Bethlehem
[16:21] did you know he was born in Bethlehem
[16:24] Lambs were born between late March and
[16:28] mid-april
[16:29] so he was born between late March and
[16:33] the beginning of end of April according
[16:36] to the word of God can you say Amen to
[16:38] them
[16:39] [Applause]
[16:44] he was the son of God Joseph assumed
[16:47] fatherly duties being espoused to Mary
[16:51] so Joseph was not his father
[16:54] he took on fatherly duties but the Holy
[16:58] Ghost was his father amen
[17:07] thank you
[17:08] so if you are faced with this question
[17:10] or your son Faith you can teach him this
[17:13] is what we believe based on the word of
[17:15] God
[17:16] amen
[17:19] the name of his mother was Mary
[17:22] and she found favor in the sight of God
[17:24] and was given was a virgin when she was
[17:27] found with child of the Holy Ghost In
[17:30] accordance to the scripture Isaiah 7 14.
[17:34] and he says Behold a virgin shall
[17:37] conceive bear a son and shall be called
[17:41] his name Emmanuel
[17:45] he was born
[17:48] and of the Holy Ghost she was a virgin
[17:52] and Joseph just took on the fatherly
[17:55] duties because he was espoused but his
[17:58] father was
[18:01] amen
[18:04] the place of birth was bethelium of
[18:06] Judea about 10 kilometers from Jerusalem
[18:10] he was born in a manger
[18:13] because there was no place for Mary and
[18:15] Joseph at the Inn
[18:17] measures
[18:18] are normally found in a stable which is
[18:22] perfect manges I am normally in a stable
[18:26] befitting a lamb and the Lamb of God
[18:32] foreign
[18:38] and when he was born there was also a
[18:41] light a star appeared amen
[18:46] then the question comes from
[18:49] why Jesus
[18:52] why not Muhammad why not
[18:56] anything else
[18:59] the Bible says yo Matthew 1 23
[19:03] says his name Shall be Called Emmanuel
[19:05] which being interpreted
[19:10] God
[19:12] that's why we need him because he is
[19:15] with us
[19:17] the Emmanuel
[19:21] why Jesus
[19:22] [Applause]
[19:25] he was God in flesh in order to redeem
[19:28] his children God came down
[19:32] himself
[19:34] and was manifested in flesh
[19:38] that's why we needed him
[19:40] God himself was manifested in thank you
[19:46] that's why Jesus
[19:51] can you say it after me God himself
[19:57] was manifested in flesh
[20:01] but why was he manifested in flesh why
[20:05] why
[20:06] to redeem us
[20:13] are you redeemed
[20:16] that proves that God was in
[20:19] are you redeemed
[20:22] that proves that God was in
[20:25] why Jesus the Redemptive work God became
[20:30] flesh
[20:32] he took on our sins
[20:35] where no one was found worthy and died
[20:38] on the cross
[20:40] he became sin so that we can become the
[20:43] righteousness of God second Corinthians
[20:46] 5 11 who has no sin
[20:51] but who took our sins away
[20:54] that's why we need Jesus
[21:02] thank you
[21:06] First Corinthians 15 3 2 verse forces
[21:10] for I have delivered unto you first
[21:14] of all which I have received
[21:16] how that Christ died for our sins
[21:19] according to the scriptures
[21:21] and he was buried and he rose again the
[21:24] third day according to the
[21:28] so the scripture said he will die and
[21:31] Rise Again
[21:33] and it happened just like that
[21:35] that's why is Jesus
[21:39] King God
[21:43] why Jesus
[21:46] why Jesus
[21:49] because it's Bible
[21:51] and it's fulfilled
[21:56] Acts 2 36 says therefore let all the
[22:00] house of Israel Noah surely that God has
[22:03] made that same Jesus whom we have
[22:05] crucified both Lord
[22:09] and Christ
[22:12] that's saying Jesus whom you have
[22:16] crucified is both Lord and Christ
[22:24] there
[22:25] they have the revelation of the name of
[22:28] the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[22:31] but the scripture says the son is both
[22:33] Lord
[22:35] and
[22:37] Christ
[22:40] so in other words
[22:42] the name
[22:44] shows that he was God in flesh he was
[22:48] Jesus Christ he's Lord and
[22:52] that's why we believe in Jesus
[22:56] that's why we say Jesus king
[23:04] why is he King God because God made him
[23:07] both Lord and
[23:11] he is the Emmanuel which means
[23:19] Philippians 2 10 and 11 says
[23:23] that by the name of Jesus every knee
[23:28] by the name of Jesus every knee shall
[23:31] bow
[23:33] every tongue
[23:36] shall confess that Jesus Christ is
[23:40] now do we shout Jesus king God
[23:44] because he is Lord
[23:45] [Applause]
[23:57] can you say Amen
[23:58] [Music]
[23:58] [Applause]
[24:01] Revelations 5 John wept because no man
[24:05] was found worthy
[24:07] to open the book of redemption
[24:10] and no one and but one of the elders
[24:13] told him not to weep
[24:15] because the lion of the tribe of Judah
[24:18] the root of David have prevailed to open
[24:20] the book
[24:21] but when he looked
[24:23] he saw a lamb
[24:25] as it has been slain having seven horns
[24:30] seven eyes
[24:33] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[24:36] forth into the Earth
[24:40] that's why
[24:42] it is Jesus
[24:45] that's why it is King and that's why he
[24:49] is Lord when you look at him
[24:52] when John saw him he had seven eyes
[24:57] seven horns
[25:00] seven spirits of God
[25:03] manifested
[25:05] as why he is Lord amen
[25:10] in this day the Lord himself shall
[25:13] descend
[25:14] in this day because he is Lord
[25:17] he shall descend with a shout
[25:20] with a voice
[25:22] and with a trumpet
[25:24] The Messengers were the lamb before the
[25:27] foundation of the world when he was
[25:30] slain
[25:31] the seven eyes the seven spirits of God
[25:34] sent into the Earth The Messengers have
[25:38] they come
[25:41] were they here
[25:46] so why Jesus it's God in flesh
[25:51] as the musicians play before the man of
[25:54] God come why Jesus according to what the
[25:57] Apostle wants his son to understand he
[25:59] was born of a Virgin Mary and Joseph the
[26:03] assumed the parental duties but this was
[26:07] conceived of the Holy Ghost where was he
[26:09] born in Bethlehem because the Bible says
[26:12] he will come out of
[26:14] so that's why we say we don't say he is
[26:17] Lord or that because the word of God
[26:19] says he'll be those things
[26:28] and he is Emmanuel
[26:31] God
[26:33] worth
[26:34] us
[26:37] so does do you understand young man do
[26:39] you know now when was Jesus born
[26:42] between
[26:44] March and April because that's the time
[26:47] when Lambs are born
[26:49] [Music]
[26:50] let us stand to our feet
[26:56] keep this for reference
[27:01] until you know
[27:02] I'll go why we say
[27:07] do you appreciate the man of God
[27:13] because we ask him to come
[27:15] and address US Grace for us this morning
[27:18] amen
[27:26] [Music]
[27:45] [Music]
[28:00] [Music]
[28:09] [Music]
[28:21] thank you
[28:39] [Music]
[28:53] [Music]
[29:06] [Applause]
[29:37] all right now
[29:48] oh my
[29:50] thank you
[29:53] you made me see that
[29:56] amen
[29:59] I was not supposed to be yeah
[30:02] I
[30:04] started recuperating
[30:07] and I just forced myself to
[30:12] to be here
[30:15] and that's why I'm here
[30:22] I try to save myself for the combined
[30:27] and uh
[30:28] I want to be
[30:32] really over this thing
[30:34] I think is about three or four years ago
[30:39] when I was
[30:41] struck with covet in
[30:44] bloemfontein is exactly the same time he
[30:48] came and visit me again
[30:51] and then
[30:54] I
[30:56] had quite a fight
[30:58] to get over it
[31:01] and um
[31:03] but I feel much better
[31:12] I have two weeks to go to
[31:15] a combined so um
[31:17] I need to try and get as much rest as I
[31:20] can
[31:22] so um I'm so happy for
[31:26] um
[31:27] these meetings that we had
[31:30] special house wake and now this week
[31:33] to
[31:35] give you
[31:39] the doctrine I'm a noun
[31:41] you heard such a lot
[31:44] from outside that we don't believe in a
[31:48] prophet
[31:49] and we don't even mention his name and
[31:52] we don't I think we even
[31:54] quote the prophet more than anybody else
[32:02] but we also realize that
[32:06] the young people
[32:08] is not indoctrinated
[32:13] with a doctrine that we believe in
[32:17] and we failed to sow it back
[32:21] and
[32:23] so that
[32:26] you can
[32:29] say it over and over and over again
[32:35] to your family
[32:39] imagine the Jews
[32:43] there's some core values
[32:46] that they are sowing back every day
[32:50] for more than five thousand years the
[32:53] same thing
[32:54] those children hear it every time
[33:00] now if you watch How I pulled it up I
[33:03] brought out what we believe is first
[33:08] before Jesus
[33:10] you know and just to clear the thing up
[33:14] people might think how could you put
[33:18] brother Branham in front of Jesus
[33:22] and I'd done that purposely
[33:25] because nobody will ever know Jesus
[33:28] unless you know brother Brennan
[33:51] and um
[33:52] that's why we wanted to lay down
[33:58] the whole history
[34:01] of the man that showed us Jesus now
[34:05] we are word
[34:07] oriented
[34:09] Church
[34:12] and now automatically you ask the
[34:14] question why
[34:16] and where is the word for that
[34:20] the word for that is in Matthew 3.
[34:24] where John the Baptist which is Elijah
[34:29] said behold the lamb
[34:32] nobody knew the land
[34:35] nobody knew Jesus
[34:38] but Elijah did
[34:40] and he pointed out Jesus
[34:53] [Applause]
[35:02] so none of us here
[35:05] know Jesus
[35:07] and you would have never known Jesus
[35:11] if God didn't send
[35:13] Malachi 4.
[35:16] [Applause]
[35:31] and he told us yeah
[35:35] let's look away to Jesus how can you
[35:38] look away to Jesus if you don't know him
[35:41] so he didn't only had to show us
[35:45] but he had to point him out
[35:47] and he pointed him out
[35:58] and that
[36:00] that makes us the only people on the
[36:03] Earth
[36:04] [Music]
[36:05] that knows Jesus
[36:07] [Applause]
[36:19] and that
[36:21] also
[36:22] makes us the only people
[36:25] that calls him
[36:28] Jesus
[36:30] can't hear you
[36:34] I can't hear you
[36:38] the only people that say that
[36:51] it's quite strange
[36:54] that he always want somebody to point
[36:56] him out thank you
[36:59] [Applause]
[37:24] and that's why
[37:26] we bring out
[37:31] brother branham's a life story
[37:35] and
[37:38] the man
[37:41] called
[37:43] Jesus
[37:45] King God
[37:50] that's our Doctrine
[37:53] [Applause]
[38:02] brother CJ told us
[38:05] that he
[38:07] brought a woman and a three children
[38:10] from
[38:11] polokwane to joburg
[38:14] in the time of Ramadan
[38:17] and
[38:20] he saw the kids about two o'clock
[38:24] that they were really lame and
[38:29] and they look as if they're gonna pass
[38:30] out
[38:32] so he pulled up at the shop he says
[38:34] ma'am I see your children is hungry
[38:39] I'll just run in and buy them something
[38:41] and we can go she says you don't do that
[38:46] and he says why she says I'm a Muslim
[38:49] but to buy food he says yes
[38:54] it's Ramadan
[38:57] they must know too fast
[38:59] they'll eat tonight
[39:07] when it comes to this
[39:09] [Applause]
[39:12] when it comes to this
[39:15] you put on your feet and you feel the
[39:17] difference
[39:20] if it's fast
[39:22] they have to fast
[39:24] they need to be indoctrinated
[39:28] the thing is going to be drawn into them
[39:32] if it's Tuesday
[39:34] [Applause]
[39:37] they need to know it's Tuesday there's
[39:39] no eating
[39:48] they need to be
[39:50] brainwashed
[39:54] in what we believe
[40:03] if
[40:05] if if the Jews and Muslims
[40:10] could be so strict
[40:12] on their
[40:15] belief
[40:22] the Muslims are so strict they even
[40:24] believe in lies
[40:27] anything that the elders told them they
[40:29] believe it
[40:32] you take for instance they're saying
[40:34] that Muhammad
[40:38] went to heaven
[40:41] from the Temple mount
[40:46] and you try to look at history
[40:49] Muhammad was never
[40:51] in Israel
[40:53] but they believe it
[40:56] because they get told that every day
[40:59] when you tell somebody a lie every day
[41:04] they're going to believe that lie
[41:06] and if we tell our children every day
[41:11] the same thing
[41:13] over
[41:14] and over and over and over and over
[41:19] again they will believe it
[41:31] so
[41:33] you cannot compromise
[41:36] on one little thing
[41:38] that we teach in El Tabernacle not one
[41:40] thing
[41:41] [Applause]
[41:43] you need to believe everything that we
[41:45] say yeah
[41:47] well if it's not Bible
[41:49] you don't believe it
[41:51] but if it's hurting yeah
[41:54] only ones
[41:56] you put your life on it
[42:00] believe it
[42:03] with everything in you
[42:07] and how could
[42:09] Jonathan even said why is it the
[42:12] Muhammad or somebody like that Muhammad
[42:15] is not a prophet he's never been a
[42:16] prophet
[42:17] there's not one time Muhammad prophesied
[42:27] to our young people must know
[42:31] who Jesus is
[42:34] because they claim Deuteronomy
[42:37] that God will raise up a prophet and
[42:39] they say that is Muhammad
[42:41] but Muhammad is a not a prophet
[42:43] he never prophesied anything
[42:46] you never said something will come to
[42:48] pass and it came to pass so it's not a
[42:50] prophet
[42:51] so we can't believe in it
[42:54] our children need to know not to believe
[42:56] in it I don't have to grow up not to
[42:59] believe in him I don't have to get so
[43:03] strong in their faith and say Jesus
[43:05] Christ is that prophet of Deuteronomy
[43:12] foreign
[43:22] ought to know
[43:24] that Muhammad married an old woman
[43:28] you wanted to taste our old woman taste
[43:31] and when she died
[43:34] he married
[43:36] and slept with a nine-year-old
[43:40] now which prophet ever slept with the
[43:42] baby
[43:43] made his wife
[43:48] but there's a Doctrine they believe in
[43:50] the Quran says that every Muslim can
[43:55] marry Four Women
[43:57] but he had ate
[44:01] so we need reality
[44:04] and we got reality
[44:06] because of our foundation is built on
[44:09] the prophet
[44:11] and the apostles
[44:14] so we can't go wrong because we know
[44:17] we're right
[44:19] amen
[44:23] that's why we told the sisters
[44:28] when that baby is born
[44:31] the minute that baby is born
[44:34] you take a
[44:36] or you take him he always been his ear
[44:41] and you whisper
[44:44] my child remember
[44:47] Jesus is King God
[44:49] my child remember
[44:53] God sent a prophet
[44:56] my child remember
[44:58] God sent the Holy Ghost in E El
[45:02] Tabernacle
[45:09] [Applause]
[45:33] foreign
[45:35] [Applause]
[45:44] so that goes to say brother William
[45:47] the first thing that God hears and that
[45:50] boy or girl years when they enter into
[45:53] this realm
[45:55] is God
[45:57] first thing the ear here
[46:01] now why why the ear
[46:04] because the ear is the first organ that
[46:07] develops
[46:08] while at babies in the stomach she
[46:11] already knows her mother's voice
[46:29] and then when Mom talk into the ear
[46:31] there
[46:33] that is already developed long ago
[46:35] and it catches the the the words from
[46:39] Mom and the words is
[46:42] another dimension God
[46:46] how can a child go wrong
[46:51] and the last thing that shuts off they
[46:53] say
[46:55] the last thing that shuts off when you
[46:57] die is your ear
[47:00] because when somebody is in a coma
[47:04] and you speak they can hear you
[47:07] although they're in a coma because the
[47:09] ear is active
[47:12] so that's the reason it's a must for you
[47:16] to talk into their ear
[47:21] oh
[47:37] and therefore brethren
[47:41] it's good to repeat things
[47:44] I got one problem I preach
[47:48] never the same thing but a good preach
[47:51] is a preacher that repeats things
[47:53] because God keeps on repeating
[47:57] remember remember
[48:00] he'll tell you he repeats himself all
[48:02] the time
[48:04] because we have to forget
[48:08] and we need to remind
[48:11] our children around
[48:14] the table at suppertime
[48:19] remind them
[48:22] about the doctrine
[48:24] remind them
[48:26] about King Jesus
[48:30] remind them about
[48:34] the miracle
[48:36] that has happened to you
[48:41] and then when you finish
[48:45] you bless your wife
[48:48] and you'll bless your children
[48:51] because that's what we don't do
[48:55] we have to do it every time God
[48:59] bless my wife
[49:01] God bless my children
[49:12] brethren
[49:15] this weekend might seem simple
[49:19] but God is hidden in simplicity
[49:32] you know
[49:35] it's such a good thing once in a while
[49:38] just to break away from
[49:43] a wife
[49:44] and children
[49:46] to be a little alone with him
[49:57] like this weekend
[49:58] [Applause]
[50:02] you ought to have a time of your life
[50:06] because you went away from the hustle
[50:09] and the bustle of brethren
[50:13] to be with him
[50:15] who loves your soul so very much
[50:18] [Applause]
[50:33] he has overcome everything
[50:37] he cried victory over everything
[50:40] [Music]
[50:43] he walked over every evil spirit
[50:49] and you know what
[50:51] as I'm closing
[50:57] he could have called Ten Thousand Angels
[51:00] that Saturday
[51:03] the Saturday
[51:06] [Applause]
[51:21] oh
[51:30] I'm sure that wormwood
[51:33] wanted to come with him
[51:36] I'm sure Gabriel was already
[51:40] I'm sure you real
[51:43] was ready
[51:47] I'm very very very very very sure
[51:50] that Raphael
[51:52] was ready to go with him
[51:58] I'm sure 10 000 Legions of angels
[52:03] was ready to join him
[52:05] [Music]
[52:06] [Applause]
[52:11] [Music]
[52:11] [Applause]
[52:13] [Music]
[52:19] but you know what
[52:20] [Applause]
[52:23] he remembered his own words in Matthew
[52:25] 24.
[52:27] he says hell
[52:30] was made
[52:32] for the devil and his angels it wasn't
[52:35] made
[52:36] for Heavenly angels and it wasn't made
[52:39] for you
[52:41] and then he said I'm not going to go
[52:43] down there
[52:45] with my bride
[52:48] my bride hell is not made for you he
[52:51] says I'll go down this Saturday alone
[52:55] a one-man invasion
[52:56] [Music]
[52:58] [Applause]
[52:58] [Music]
[53:05] [Music]
[53:06] [Applause]
[53:21] [Music]
[53:27] it just shows you
[53:34] if anybody goes to hell he goes alone
[53:37] you won't have the brothers with him
[53:43] the rich and ruler said
[53:45] can you just won
[53:48] my brethren
[53:50] not to come to this place he was alone
[53:55] hell is a lonely place
[53:57] [Music]
[53:59] you go there alone
[54:01] [Music]
[54:03] but the funniest part of it all
[54:07] funniest part of it all
[54:10] heaven we go as a group
[54:13] for together we'll meet the Lord in the
[54:17] air and so shall we be with God God
