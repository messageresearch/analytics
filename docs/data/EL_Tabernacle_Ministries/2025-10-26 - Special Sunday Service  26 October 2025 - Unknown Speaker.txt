Is there someone in the house this morning and said, "Lord, I come to worship you. I come to give you honor. I come [music] to give you glory. He's a good God this morning. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. All across South Africa, [music] I wish you could be here right now. I wish you could feel the vibration right now. I wish you could feel the waves of God, the waves of the Holy Ghost, the good news, the gospel trumpet. Is there a trumpet here this morning? Why don't you lift your instrument up this morning? Why don't you lift your voice this morning? Show Satan on whose side you on this morning. [music] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You can do better than [music] that. Al tabernacle. [music] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's like a beehive. It's like a beehive. Bloomain is known to be a beehive. Maybe you forgot that we are at the altar of Ed. [music] Maybe you forgot that there is a beehive. Are there any bees making honey this morning? [music] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [music] You need a God. You need a God to meet the need of the people. You need a God to meet the need of the day. [music] You need a God to meet your financial need. And I got news for you. He's here this morning. He's here this morning. He's here this morning. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. [music] We greet you every brother, every sister, &gt;&gt; those that have come from near and far. You never wasted your petrol money this morning. You already blessed from the minute the ad went out. It already stirred the neighborhood. It already stirred El Tabernacle. We were already blessed before we even stepped into this moment. What are you saying, preacher? We just playing out. We just came to play out what the author had in the script. And there's no demon in hell that can rob a child of God. God already saw you in this meeting. God already saw you in last night's meeting. God already saw you in Friday's meeting. It's already a done deal. [music] Why, preacher, [screaming] why? Before I conceived you, before you were in your mother's womb, I ordained you. I knew you. I loved you. It's the blood cell. It speaks. It speaks, Lord. It speaks. May your blood shall speak this morning to the throne of God. You are Mrs. Jesus. You are a child of God. You are a daughter of God. There's enough power within you to create a world. [music] to create a world and you can go and [music] live on it. Let's give the Lord a shabbat this morning. Let's give the Lord a shabbat this morning. Let's give the Lord a shabbat this morning. Let's give him just a little louder. Just a little louder. [music] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Forgive me this morning. I'm a very excited preacher [music] this morning. Why? Why can we have that quotation? I just want to round off the weekend. My cousin started with the quote. My Opa punctuated the quote. And so, and so, and so he's a preacher. Is there a preacher here this morning? His father is a preacher. And I think the old man can out preach the other two. And what a double portion. Because the apostle said, "Brother Brandham, it's greater than what you think. I've got an uncle that's a preacher. [music] I've got a cousin that's a preacher. We are family of preacher. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It's greater. It's greater than this quote. It's fun. [music] Can you imagine if one of you [music] can chase a million demons? What about four preachers? [music] What about a family [music] of preachers? House of hell. You in trouble. El tabernacle. El tabernacle. El tabernacle. I'm not here uplifting my family. No. But we can't help for what God has put together. You can't help that you're the bride of Jesus Christ. You can't help as God knew it's going to be you. So no matter what the critic says this morning, I'm embracing my destiny. I'm a child of God. I'm a daughter of God. Oh, hallelujah. [music] I don't think I'm going to finish this morning. He says it's mighty nice. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; If you got a family like that, a church that has a family like that, it's so beautiful. Are you happy this morning? Have you found the family? And I think after last night without a shadow of doubt, he's the greatest preacher, the greatest scientist, the greatest of all time. He's the goat in my books. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You can do better than that. El tabernacle, do you appreciate God's apostle? Do you appreciate God's servant? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. [cheering] There's a saying in our family. We're in the business of saving souls, but not only that, keeping souls safe. &gt;&gt; He knows how to take the vessel. &gt;&gt; He knows how to pour the oil in. He knows every shape and size of every vessel. He knows this one needs a little bit &gt;&gt; and that one needs a lot &gt;&gt; because he's the handler of the oil and he's the God of the generations and he's imparted his knowledge to his family because Jehovah &gt;&gt; is God with his family. He knows &gt;&gt; that your vessel is the soul &gt;&gt; and in the vessel [music] is the nature of God. Zoe, the life of God, &gt;&gt; the oil &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; He says in in Abraham and his [music] seed 610460 &gt;&gt; when you're filled &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; it is the person &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost himself. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a greater gift than the word. You need the person. You need a personal pronoun today. [cheering] on answers maner. We make mistakes [cheering] el tabernacle. If you can just remember one thing today that I have said, you ought to thank God daily for the gift that's in this ministry. You ought to wake up every morning knowing, like the apostle said, there's a God out there. &gt;&gt; We are fortunate people this morning. &gt;&gt; I wonder, can we bow our heads? &gt;&gt; Gracious Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm beside myself this morning. Lord, I pray that you may bless your people. &gt;&gt; Father, it is your people, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we are nothing &gt;&gt; unless somebody &gt;&gt; died for us. &gt;&gt; Somebody loved us, Lord. [cheering] Somebody came our way. [screaming] &gt;&gt; And Lord, it's because of that samarita. Lord, he took us into the inn and he covered our wounds with oil. And we want to say thank you, Lord, for this ministry. Father, may you bless everyone that has come. &gt;&gt; Lord, may you strengthen your servant this day. May you bless him, Father. May you make his heart glad, Father. Lord, we love him. &gt;&gt; We appreciate him, Lord. May you bless your word, &gt;&gt; Lord. I cannot break it. But father, the way you break it, &gt;&gt; the language you speak, &gt;&gt; Lord, your sheep understands the language. Lord, may you bless our servers this morning. If there be a visitor in the camp, &gt;&gt; Lord, may their hearts burn within them &gt;&gt; to say, "Father, I'm not going to harden my heart, &gt;&gt; but I'm giving you my heart this morning. &gt;&gt; I've given you my heart &gt;&gt; and we know it's in a good place this morning, Lord. Come now &gt;&gt; and bless us, Father. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But the hotter it gets, &gt;&gt; the better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] I wonder at this moment in time just turn to your brother, your sister, say, "It's good to be here. I love you. I appreciate you." To the visitor friend, just go shake someone's hand that you don't know. Welcome to the service this morning. Oh, it's so beautiful. Don't be cross this morning. Just just turn to that person, you know, and just say, "I love you. I appreciate you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just I just want to rub it in a little, you know. I just want to rub it in a little. [music] want to do something. [music] You you have my two grandsons preaching with me, but I would like to just rub it in. I got my grandson on their piano. my grandson on the piano [music] [applause] and I have a double portion. I have my grandson on the bass guitar. Get up there. Give us a strum there. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Jealous Tom. Jealous Tom [cheering] [music] and the whole family in heaven. &gt;&gt; Did you ever see a thing like this? &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; But our tabernacle, we have it here. Thank you. Let's give God's apostle a hand. Let's give Brother Eda a hand. Let's give the troll Augustine a hand. [music] Let's give the Augustine family a hand. Uncle Ariel, my cousins, let's give the family a hand this morning. [music] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I just want to also rub it in. Grandpa Topella, do you have that picture? It's the angel. Let's just give her a hand [applause] now, man. Sir, &gt;&gt; it's a family weekend for ons. &gt;&gt; So, I'm entitled to bring out the files. &gt;&gt; Amen. So they won't tell you it, but I actually converted all these cousins. [cheering] &gt;&gt; They were in my meetings. Sister Esther, [music] there's Uriah in one of my church services there. So I wasn't ordained a preacher. No, man. I was born I was born into royalty. I didn't have a choice but I was born into it. [cheering and applause] And there's no pleasure better, no golf game, no singing a song can [music] compared to doing something for God's people. It's better than being the president of a country is to have a preacher. Amen, sir. Amen, sir. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you have your Bibles this morning, turn to two portions of scripture. So, let's leave Matthew. &gt;&gt; Let's leave Luke. But let's go to John because John speaks plainly. John doesn't beat around the bush. John will say who the son of God is. [cheering and applause] John 5 verse 39 and 40. John 5:39 and 40. &gt;&gt; Search the scriptures. &gt;&gt; I invite you this morning. &gt;&gt; Visit a friend eel tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Search, search this Bible. For in them ye think &gt;&gt; in those scriptures &gt;&gt; you think that you have eternal life. &gt;&gt; And little do you know &gt;&gt; they are they &gt;&gt; which only testify [cheering] &gt;&gt; of me. &gt;&gt; Jesus. You can go and search the scriptures, but it's only a testimony of the son Beth. &gt;&gt; But the problem we make is we think that's where the eternal life is. &gt;&gt; Amen, sir. Amen. Sir, &gt;&gt; amen. [cheering] and he will not come unto me. &gt;&gt; It's so deep this thing. &gt;&gt; It's like the apostle said it's the saddest line. &gt;&gt; Because we find that they majored on the testimony of the word &gt;&gt; and they thought they've got life. And here Jesus your God says, "Why don't you search the scriptures?" &gt;&gt; He invites you this morning. [cheering] &gt;&gt; But he will not come unto me a foolish virgin. Even in that scripture, &gt;&gt; the scripture doesn't do anything &gt;&gt; because you can take this book, you can buy it at any bookshop, you can this is very available &gt;&gt; but this can't save me. I need [cheering] &gt;&gt; [music] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Did you catch it? &gt;&gt; Why do I need that? Because I need eternal life. &gt;&gt; I never came to church to waste my time from Joberg on blue day. I don't I don't Why must I be here? I came for eternal life. &gt;&gt; I came for eternal [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; And he's sad because he says he will not come &gt;&gt; that you might have life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But El tabernacle I'm like the hymnwriter this morning. &gt;&gt; Say, "Here's my vessel. &gt;&gt; Here's my cup. &gt;&gt; I want you to fill it up. Not with the letter, not with the script, but with the manifestation of that word, which is the eternal life of God, which is Zoe." Because the letter &gt;&gt; but the spirit. &gt;&gt; So if the spirit gives life, &gt;&gt; why do they major on the letter? &gt;&gt; John 6 verse 60 &gt;&gt; to 69. Many therefore of his disciples &gt;&gt; when they heard this said, &gt;&gt; "This is a hard saying. &gt;&gt; Who can hear it?" &gt;&gt; When it comes to his blood, &gt;&gt; when it comes to drinking, &gt;&gt; when it comes to the flesh, &gt;&gt; it's a hard thing. [cheering] When it comes to communion, &gt;&gt; when Jesus knew in himself that the disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, &gt;&gt; "Do this offend you &gt;&gt; in El Tabernacle, is it offending you?" &gt;&gt; Because this is where the division comes. Because you need to have so much faith in your leader. Because if you don't believe in the leader, he will take you to your damnation. He will take you to a destination you do not want to be. &gt;&gt; So you've got to have faith in your leader. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; David was so powerful that the congregation that the whole of Israel chanted his name because they had faith that this David slew a Goliath. That means there's a God with this little man. There's a God in this little body. There's a God in this little man. [cheering] And this morning we have another representation. There's a God in a man [cheering] that has slayed your Goliath in your life. [cheering] And that is why this is a glorious church without spot or wrinkle because we know who our leader is. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You've got to have faith in God's servant. How do you do the will of God or the works of God? Believe. [cheering] [screaming] &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do this morning. You just got to believe in the scent one which is an apostolic gift. [cheering] [applause] Many want to do something for God. Many want to walk for God. &gt;&gt; But all you've got to do is believe. &gt;&gt; That's the requirement. &gt;&gt; Then you pass from death unto life because it's not your problem. We in the business of saving souls. He's the handler of the oil. He knows your need. Expel your thoughts to your pastor. Your pastor will see you through. It's the dove leading the eagle. It's the ammoya. Don't burden yourself this morning. It's too much for you. Give it over and believe it. If it's of God, it will come to pass. If it's of God, it will manifest itself. If it's of God, it's not your business to question. Just believe, child of God, [music] what? And if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before. Here Jesus asks them a question. Maybe if you see me &gt;&gt; ascend. Maybe that will boost your faith. Because as human beings that's what we want. We want an angel now &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven. We want a quick miracle. &gt;&gt; We need something to convince us that this is it. That's human nature. &gt;&gt; That's the life you in. But you need an eternal life where you pull your strength and you say, "I I don't understand it, but I believe it this morning. I don't need you to ascend. I don't need you to go up. [screaming] You're on the earth now. You're on the earth now. Don't go up. Take me with you. Say hallelujah somebody. Say hallelujah. Somebody. We are not like the disciples this morning. We don't need a quick thing. We believe it. We believe it this morning. Oh, hallelujah. It is the spirit. The spirit that quickenth, &gt;&gt; it is the spirit. &gt;&gt; That quickenth because your body is weak. Your body has mistakes. But the spirit within you, it revives you week in and weak out. It's your power bank. [cheering] I'm going to leave the others. Let me just get to my point. Verse 67. Then Jesus said unto the 12, "Ye will he also go. El tabernacle, &gt;&gt; will you also go?" [cheering] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus this morning asking the church, "Will you also go?" Then Simon Peter. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like Peter. Oh, he spoke his mind. He wasn't like the 12 that was confused. Oh, who's living beside me? Peter jumped up. Peter jumped up. Peter jumped up. Oh, and he looked the Messiah, &gt;&gt; the son of the living loving God in the eye [cheering] and he says, "Lord, [screaming] Lord, Lord, to whom shall we go?" El tabernacle. El tabernacle. Where can we go from this? It took an apostolic answer. It took the guy with the keys to the Holy Ghost to answer &gt;&gt; and say, "Where are we going to go?" &gt;&gt; And Peter doesn't stop there. &gt;&gt; El tabernacle, I want you to read it. &gt;&gt; Thou, &gt;&gt; just read it one more time. Just one more time. &gt;&gt; You need a preacher. You need a leader &gt;&gt; that's got the word for your day. &gt;&gt; You need someone that's got eternal life. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add a blessing &gt;&gt; to the reading of this word. [cheering] &gt;&gt; May you just hug your brother and your sister before you take your seat. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry for keeping you so long, Grandpa. I'm sorry for letting you stand so long, but it needs to sink in this morning. It needs to go into your theophony this morning. You need to realize who you are. &gt;&gt; You need to realize that you're just not by the way. &gt;&gt; You need to realize that any church out there can't give you eternal life. Mike like for Peter man &gt;&gt; the others were so confused &gt;&gt; and he throws the ball back to Jesus. &gt;&gt; It was the greatest tennis match &gt;&gt; because Jesus asked the question first. &gt;&gt; Are you going to go? [cheering] And Peter said, "Where are we going to go, &gt;&gt; Lord? Where can we go?" &gt;&gt; He says, "You've got the words of eternal life." &gt;&gt; And imagine how Jesus felt. He knew that that answer came directly from the father above. Because only the father can put that desire in your heart to know where you come from, to know where you going to, to know who's your leader, to know who's your representative. [cheering] &gt;&gt; And visitor friend, we invite you this morning. &gt;&gt; Where are you going to go? Which church are you going to go to this morning that can give you the everlasting gospel? That can give you eternal life abundantly, that can preach the gospel without any shortity. You need a church. You need a representation from the throne of God. You need a guide that can take you by the hand and show you the ABCs and show you what is the basics of the Ephesians church age. They can show you there will be babies born in the millennium. They can show you the genetics of God. They can show you how the atom was broken. They can show you how life formed. They can show you creation started. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; like a Pentecostal experience without beginning and without the end. That is what life is this morning. Life is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Life is the Amoya. Life is Zoe. The goal. [cheering] Oh, I'm excited this morning. I'm excited this morning. I want to be like Peter. I want to say, "Where can I go, Lord? Where can I go? You've got the words of eternal life. [cheering] For a title this morning, [cheering] we started the weekend with a question. &gt;&gt; Where is the God of Elijah? [cheering] Let's end it with a question. Lord, to whom shall we go? &gt;&gt; Thou has the words of eternal life. &gt;&gt; I want to take that thought this morning. And I want to put it in your lap this morning. El tabernacle visit a friend. &gt;&gt; Where can we go &gt;&gt; in the hour that we love him? in the time that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 30:1 19 says, "I call heaven and earth to record this day against you." &gt;&gt; That I have set before you life. &gt;&gt; I have set before you. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; so the choice is yours this morning. Do you want eternal life &gt;&gt; or do you want a wordbased doctrine that's full of the scriptures that's so hard to digest? But when you have a ministry, hallelujah, that's got the oil to mix the meal and digest the system and move down. And when it reaches your system, it knows how to go because the body is so beautifully made. There's a certain amount of oil that your spiritual body needs and when it gets that [cheering] you feel leer in the service brothers they can [cheering] say word [cheering] [cheering] a blessing and a curse. Therefore, choose life &gt;&gt; that both thou. &gt;&gt; Can you read it for me? that both thou. &gt;&gt; So if this family, &gt;&gt; if this preaches, &gt;&gt; if the old man in the quote &gt;&gt; didn't choose life, &gt;&gt; read that part again at the bottom there, that thy &gt;&gt; we are alive this morning. We came to preach this morning because we have a handler of the oil that chose eternal life for his family that says, "Rosco family, we're going to choose the blessing. We're going to choose the blessing. We're going to be like Jacob this morning. We're going to steal the Holy Ghost from every church, from every denomination, from every organization. And we took the blessing. We took the birthright." The apostle ran with the stump, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he says, "This is for my family. [cheering] &gt;&gt; This is for my church. Amen." [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Years back they told the apostle, "You chose the best part. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; You took the best part &gt;&gt; of the whole lamb of the whole [cheering] because everything like Pastor Jude said is the Holy Ghost. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; In march to the blood, the apostle says, "Isn't sin like death? Sin sold the prince of life &gt;&gt; for a mere 30 pieces of silver. It will always make eternal life cheap. &gt;&gt; Sin in your life will always make eternal life cheap. &gt;&gt; If you are a sinner, don't treat eternal life with contempt. If you're not, then why are you still going on in sin? &gt;&gt; A sinner treats eternal life cheap and mortal life gets treated with glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sir, &gt;&gt; can I get a amen? [cheering] &gt;&gt; It's hard, but it's the truth. &gt;&gt; And not only the sinner, but also in our in our in our church. We treat our car as if it's everything. &gt;&gt; We treat our health as if it's everything. But we fail to realize that we are not here on our own merit. We are called our people. We are holy priesthood. We are chosen nation.
