TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. We um want to greet everybody in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We have um set this thing out to do this clip and um for tabernacle we have mentioned it as we're going to have these this meeting on the 10th of October Friday night and um we thought that we'll just put out this clip so that um uh our church around South Africa could uh get ready for this meeting. So, um we're just going to have um a little talk around it. to um actually sketch a picture of um this meeting. I'm quite excited um to actually uh preach it and go into it and um I know it is going to be a tremendous blessing to um to uh this part of the bride of Jesus Christ and a person can only do what's in your theophony and uh I believe that this message is certainly something that's been laid in me before the foundation of the world to bring out and preach. So let us go into it. &gt;&gt; Thank you apostle. Thank you for your time. and we let go. &gt;&gt; So agree the church and the saints at large. May God bless you. Um thank you for your time, Apostle. Apostle Mike, first question is that I see you are preaching a lot around Matthew 25. What is the reason? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, a good a good question. Um it's uh it's special to me. I preach on it 13 years ago and I must mention uh Edgar uh that it didn't go well in the message when I preach it and um I got a little bit of stick for preaching it and um 30 years ago Huh? Because the majority of the message believe it was Pentecost is a foolish virgin. And um but going through it, you know that the spirit of God speaks to preachers. He showed me that it isn't and that the foolish virgin is in the bride and not Pentecost. And because um they went on that brother Brandham seemingly has shown to the Pentecostals, you know, but there's a lot of things that brother Brandham dropped that clearly indicated to me 30, 40 years ago that is in the message and uh in question and answers. He says um the foolish virgin is closer home than what we think. And uh that actually stirred my curiosity that uh Pentecost is not closer home. It's not here near us. We're miles apart. And then I could see that brother Brham was showing where the foolish virgin is going to be. And uh then he says in the 10 virgins she's a virgin. You can only be a virgin through the word. and Pentecost don't have the word so they aren't and will never be a virgin and brother B says both of them are virgins you know and that further showed me that the only virgins you are going to get will be in the message then it says she is so close it will deceive the very elect if it's possible and he makes the sister read the scripture Matthew 24:24 so another point that it could not be Pentecost another point that it clearly shows it's in the message so close Pentecost cannot deceive us. Their mouths apart. You know, you just look at a woman and you know they're not close. So that's another point that shows that it is not Pentecost but in the message the foolish virgins is amidst us. She and the wise recognized the same voice Malachi 4 and woke up. Pentecost don't recognize brother Brandham's voice. They're not under that voice. So that is another point that it can't be Pentecost but message. They all press and play. They know the voice of the of the of the of the messenger. And that's another point, a proven point, a solid point to show that it is not Pentecost. They're in the message. right here with us. So um and uh brother Bham says in question and answers if you know what watch that voice came it was not in the first watch it was in the seventh watch go meet the bridegroom. So that voice is a seventh angel's voice which is brother Brham and Pentecost don't recognize that voice. So it is a clear indication that the foolish virgins is amidst the bride. Then um it says that they all woke up to trim their lambs. The wise and the foolish got up and trimmed their lamps. Now the lamb we all know the psalm writer says the word of God is a lamp unto our feet. So the lambs is the word of God. So all of them had the word of God and the word of God in the seventh watch is the message of the hour and they all had the same lamps which they all were under the same ministry of the seventh angel. So um it is another point that makes it more at home than anywhere else. We should not even look at a Pentecostals or anybody else. Those guys are here. Another place brother says the hypocrites. They act as if they are, but they not. They act as if they are bride, but they're not. And that's hypocrisy. That's the reason when you look at them, you can just see it's a facade. It's a put on, you know, and that's another point. And brother Brandham goes on in the 10 virgins. He said she preaches the word you know same he said same like the wise virgin. So they had the same word they all they press and played you know and they said the same thing preached the same thing. Brother Brandon says, "So Pentecost don't preach the same message we preach." So again, it's a proven fact that they write here amidst us. And um the prophet says she had everything. The wise virgin had everything. She believe in the blood. She believed in sanctification. Brother Bland says she believe in the atonement. She preached the word. She preached justification. She preached a healing. All the same. And she had a clean life. Brotherson, her life was as clean as a whistle. He says you couldn't put your finger on a life. That means when a guy don't live a life, you can put your finger on him. according to 10 virgins. But with a foolish virgin, you can't you couldn't even do that. She was just as clean as the wise virgin. They had everything the same. But brother Abraham says the only difference between the two was the oil, the quickening power, the good news that the Holy Ghost is here. That was the only difference. All right. &gt;&gt; So now if we look in here and we look at them then or in a message you have to look where the oil is because the oil determines whether she's bride or not bride because she's got the lamp. She's already got the mechanics, but she don't have the dynamics. So, you don't have to worry about the word because she's in the word. But what brother says, I don't care about the word, the mechanics, push and play. I'm worried about the dynamics that must come onto the mechanics. So when you are in a end time church, if you're vigilant, then you will look for a church that has the dynamics and the mechanics. I think in question and answers, he also say uh uh he also says um um he likes a church that's full of the Holy Ghost, you know. So what make them foolish is that they know they don't have it and yet they go on which is foolish. It's like somebody tells you don't smoke, you're going to get cancer and you go on smoking. Is that intelligence? It's not. And uh then what comes to being is what brother Brandham says in Daniel 70 weeks. My wife's quote, she used to like it and she always used to tell me, Edgar, this people is willfully blind. You know it's it's not that they are naturally they like what Africans word says as they're going to show you're going to stay in this message under this pastor regardless if he's wrong. So that makes them fools and um because a real Brian member will look at the thing and say this is not right. So, I'm not going to be a fool to follow this thing because this thing ends up in the third dimension of hell. So, foolishness is brought in Matthew 25. And uh what I would like to bring out the Bloom team is they foolish and foolish is to know the truth but you still go for error. You're a fool, you know. So you can look around. I'm sorry to say this and I don't mean to be ugly. How many fools have you got in this message that knows the truth and go against it with everything in you? How could you get u Matthew 25 which is prophetic? It is the coming of the Lord. And in that coming the groom tells you what I want from you is oil to come in here. The Holy Ghost I want you to have my spirit. And I could never understand it when we were with brother Coleman those years. We we would like to quote this quote out of question and answers where brother B says the foolish virgin rejected the atonement in its fullness. I could never splice it. I could never ever get my thoughts around it. But now going back into it, I realize that the oil is a seven spirits and seven church ages. It's a baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; So the statue of a perfect man is the full atonement. It's the whole blood. Brother Abraham says the token could only come at the end. Why? Because those seven bloods then came and made the token, the full atonement and they rejected it right at the time of the coming of the broom. Now you want to be bride, you have to be under subjection to the groom. And what the groom wanted was oil to enter in the Holy Ghost. and they rejected it. This message, nobody can come sit in front of me and say they didn't reject it. Nobody. They had many things to say about it. It's hogwash. It's Pentecostalism. It's it's emotions. They just tag everything on it that's ugly. and it became the rejected stone. But I thank God that there was somebody in South Africa that when we go pick up that rejected stone and today they all wanted after fighting all those years today they want it and they don't have it. It's like I told brother Owen Palmer I says Owen just be honest tell me where can I find the Gloria where they preach on it the Holy Ghost but there's no glory nothing there's no atmosphere nothing and yet we want to later on preach on the gospel or what brother mention what the gospel is and where he says that um um the Holy Ghost is the main main thing greater than the word greater than press and play because the Holy Ghost brought press and play the word. So, brother Bam says it's greater than he quotes the scripture of uh speaking against the word, you'll be forgiven. He said, but speaking against the Holy Ghost, no forgiveness. He says that's the greatest. And that's the reason we call this the greatest sermon. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because we busy with the greatest thing. And um uh we want to preach later on on um um the working of the Holy Ghost. Not the Holy Ghost. After you have the Holy Ghost, where's the working of the Holy Ghost? Some places they call it the acts. acting, you know, how did you act when you received the Holy Ghost, you know, so we can Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, but you need the working of the Holy Ghost. If you say the Holy Ghost is here, let us see in your church how does it work. You find people say, "Okay, let let us worship God." And the pastor goes there and he blah blah blah, you know, he's the alpha, he's the omega, he's the beginning, he's the end, and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. And the church also go when he say amen, it stopped. That's not Bible worship. Bible worship you find when the uh tabernacle was dedicated. The Bible says the glory of the Lord came in and the ministers couldn't minister. You know, you can just stand there and the Holy Ghost pours out. That's Bible worship, you know. And uh when the minister's finished blah blah blah blah and the alpha and omega and all that, you know, when he's finished with that, then ship, it's cut off. No feeling, no atmosphere, no pull. And when you take that back to the Bible, you don't find that in the Bible. Find in the Bible emotions. You find in the Bible speaking in tongues. You find in the Bible the working of the Holy Ghost, signs and wonders and miracles. You know, you find in the Bible, you know, the um uh supernatural happens find in the B people drunk and you know a whole deal Gloria and you don't have the Gloria. No way. Dio Gloria means the glory of the Lord. So it that's why I um I'm on this thing because from Revelations 10 the prophecy how could you leave out Matthew 25? Yes, &gt;&gt; cuz Matthew 25 hooks up. I don't know if that answers your question. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, Apostle. Thank you. It it actually leads leads into my next question. Um, we we saw when the announcement went out for the services, you've captioned it for us to have a prophetic insight in Matthew 25. Why would you say that? Apostle &gt;&gt; why um if we believe that the seals is prophetic. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because that's a prophecy. And um then how could you leave out Matthew 25? Because Matthew 24 is a six seals. Matthew 25 is a main seal, the coming of the Lord. Behold, the bridegroom will cometh. So if I had to preach on Revelations 10 and never came back to Matthew 25, then I haven't done justice to Revelations 10. &gt;&gt; And then ask yourself the question, is Revelations 10 prophetic? Why don't anybody preach on it only a prophetic class? So that's the reason when I saw that that it actually slides in to the seals and also when it comes to the twins he'll bring Matthew 24:24 on which is in the six seals. It's close. So that's the reason um I that's one of the reasons I hooked it up because it's the coming of the Lord, the seventh seal. Matthew 25 is the seventh seal. And um the wise virgin Edgar is the book of Revelations 10:2 because their names, the wise virgins names is in Revelations 10:2. And that makes it prophetic. That that brings a hallelujah. You know, if we don't if we didn't tie it up over here in the book of Revelations, then we would have had a broken Hallelujah. But so great is this thing here that you can take it and rush it right back to Revelations 10. Her name in the book which is in his right hand. Psalm Revelations 10:1 is the bridegroom. Revelations 10:2 is is his wife. So how can you go wrong? You know, and she's got his spirit. That's why the prophecy says the spirit and the bride. Brother Bible says &gt;&gt; they were one. Now where did they become one is when she filled up with oil. So it is prophetic and that's why for all these years look the message is nearly around for 100 years but nobody ever touched this. You know, they might mention it, but they haven't got insight. This has to come again in the prophecy. Revelations 10:8, prophesy again. What are we doing? We're prophesying again, but out of Matthew, out of the mouth of the guru. How beautiful is that, you know, to to be able to sit here and look at the whole thing played out. But the scary point is what he says, it's it's so close. They got long dresses. They got long hair. They Brother Brandham around the corner. They push and play. They believe the word. They believe in the atonement. They believe in the crucifixion, brother Brandham says. And they have all that and they just show oil and they miss it. So why go to a church that has all that and you know there's no oil there? That's foolish. That's why the Bible says foolish. You know the truth, but you don't accept the truth. and to him that knows to do good and don't do it to him it's sin. So the insin and sin cannot enter heaven. So yeah, that's why we believe what um what our revelation tells us because it swoops in to the message. And how are they going to hear again if there's not somebody that's coming to preach it again? I mean, they were all shaken up when they quoted Revelations 10:8. &gt;&gt; But how is it does it work? How's it going to be preached again? And some guys ruined and run and say, "Well, that's the bride. You're right." But the whole bride don't preach. There's only a five-fold ministry in the bride that preach. The rest is bride, but they don't prophesy. It takes those five guys to prophesy. And I'm sorry, I have never heard any of them prophesy again. And nailing it down again, whether you like it or not. Brother told me revail and and and and and then uh preach on it said way where way reale didn't even believe in it and up to now he can't answer me he rather got cross so um that's why um it I call it prophetic insight. And I'm making it worse. That's the greatest message that has ever been preached. And I'm going to say it when I preach it that Friday. Why I say this is the greatest message that was ever preached. Show me anything greater. Especially when brother Bram comes around and say the Holy Ghost is everything. And I can take you and show you it is everything. So I think that God really wanted us to come back and speak and preach on this. And I say it again, not only the church is going to appreciate it and like it and lift up their voices and their hands about it, I'm going to feel the same. Cuz as I drew up that message, I drew waters out of the wells of salvation once again, you know. So the criteria, I mean, how could he put a criteria in the seventh seal and he says this is the criteria, not even the word, the Holy Ghost. And that's why we're going to read those quotes, you know, that he says he didn't come to give out the Holy Ghost. So then who had to come behind him and give out the Holy Ghost for 60 years? Everybody knows. So we're going to get into that thing that you know when I look at those things then I really get excited it go not not because it's me but why me if it was not in God's thinking that's why this ministry of ours is completely different and brother couldn't put it better to say there's a oddball ministry cuz nobody preaches like we for 60 years. So therefore I I want to encourage the people to um try and get a visitor and pull him along and also encourage the ones that's going to be on streaming which will be on the storehouse. I will give the details of the storehouse and uh for you to get it. I only have one problem Edgar. I really don't know if I'll be able to finish. It's the only problem I have. If not, we'll have to get another Friday. But I would like to have this message, the greatest of them all, to be on tape from the A till the Z. I think I was spared &gt;&gt; to get to this point. I feel so good that Revelations 10 is still moving on the prophecy. It's how long now? And also, Edgar, what I want to say is um why Matthew 25? Because Matthew 25 is the seventh seal and brother Bram says the anointing is on the seventh seal. Now there again I couldn't understand it way back there. I understand it now because I like to nail it back into the Bible. &gt;&gt; And I couldn't understand why he said so. But now I can because in the seventh seal you need the oil the anointing. So where is the anointing? &gt;&gt; On the seventh seal. He said I went west and came back with the Holy Ghost to bring down the Holy Ghost. The oil the seventh seal. The anointing is on the seventh seal. So I hope that that answers your question. &gt;&gt; Yes, surely does mentioning the seven seal apostle. What made you tie it into Revelation? I know you said it's the keystone Revelation. What made you tie Matthew 25 into it? Well, I must be honest. Well, I I I I didn't tie it in. Uh, Brother Brandham tied it in. I only was anointed to pick it up and tie it in like brother Brandham tied it in. And that's why when he said the kingdom of God is likened unto 10 virgins, 10 had oil, 10, five had oil, five didn't have oil, and they went a cry out at midnight, go and meet the bridegroom. And he says that was the coming of the Lord. And I said, "Wow." Then I went and read the sixth seal. In the sixth seal, he brings up Matthew 24 right down and he skips Matthew 25. And then I check in the Bible the six seals one after the other till Revelation 6. It stopped at a six seal. Revelation 6. Revelation 74 144. Then after he skipped that, then he borrowed the seven seals in Revelations 10:8. Is exactly like Matthew 24. He stopped. Then he go to Matthew 25 and he brings out the seventh seal. So I didn't tie it up. I was given eyes and a revelation to see it while nobody else saw it, you know. So, um the six seals he explained and the seventh seal is where the oil is and there's where the anointing is. None of the other seals did you have to have the oil to go in. You were told in the sixth seal with a black horse rider at night oil and the wine it was still there. But that didn't happen there in the third seal. It happened in the seventh seal when they rejected it. Then he says, "Bang, you rejected the oil. I know you're not." Now they preach it a lot of times and it does make sense. What do you mean there I know it not? Is like when a man knows his wife, she receive his seed. But here he knew her not. She had the can and the word but she didn't receive it inside of her. So he says, "I don't even know you. Can you imagine all the years you prophet prophet prophet and in the end he says I don't know you. He rejected the most important thing and I want to say it. I'm going have to say it when I die and stand in front of God. that you have rejected it in the message. You rejected it. You rejected the working of the Holy Ghost is because you didn't have the Holy Ghost. Now, everybody wants it, but there's no deal, Gloria. It's a sad sad sad case. How many pastors did we have that came to our church and says they would like to have what we have? But the time is up. The time is up. There's a time for everything. There was a time that you could get the Holy Ghost, but there's a time it's cut off. Now, why do you say so? Because Jesus told us, I think Matthew 17, as it was in the days of Noah. Now, what happened in the days of Noah? Genesis 6, he says, "My spirit, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; shall not always strive with men. My spirit will be taken away." And we know with Simpson and all this and Kabot and all that the spirit was taken away and here we are the spirit is taken away and it's hard saw and I want to say tell the brothers and I mean I tell them I don't know if you will be able to get it. They ask me to pray for them. I said, "I don't know if you're going to get it and be able to take it to your church &gt;&gt; because my concern is you uh you have Revelation 6, Black Rider. There's just a little bit left. That means it dried up until a little bit in the third seal. But when you come to the seventh seal, Matthew 25, there's no oil. The seventh seal, no oil. And that's all that I'm trying to tell them and show them. I said if you can show me where I can get the gloria you know and Jesus makes it so simple for us all. He says by their fruit you will know them. Very simple. If a man says he's evangelist check his fruit. If a man says he's a prophet check his fruit. Is that fruit? He says he is an apostle. Let him show you his fruit of an apostle. It's very simple. The man says the Holy Ghost is gone. And he says, "You show me where I can find it." And you can't find it. Then that guy is right. He's not blobbing. and saying things that is not true. Everybody knows is the truth that the Holy Ghost is gone. A thing that I want to bring in here, people think if they jump and shout and all that that's the Holy Ghost. That's not the Holy Ghost. That's what the Holy Ghost does. It will make you jump and shout and all that. But if you have the Holy Ghost in your church, even somebody outside like how many times it happened just this year, people outside, not of El Tabernacle, Pentecostals and everybody came in and says you can feel the Holy Ghost there. There's an atmosphere. But they preach on the Holy Ghost. No atmosphere, no feeling, no emotions, nothing. So it is only a talk and not a walk. I don't listen to the talk. Just go a token and a token and a to fine but let me see the working of the token. Let me come and hear you preach. Remember that the quote that brother says, you know, uh, let me ask you to come up here and, uh, let the Holy Ghost flow after you preach. You know that quote. And nobody came up. And we have the same thing. But guys speak about the Holy Ghost. Let him come up and preach and show us the dear Gloria. If you can't, you're a deceiver. You're only there to steal tithes. That's all that you care for. And you know you don't have it. That makes it so bad. And that's the reason Jesus emphatically put it down as foolish just because you like the guy's smile. you go with him. You know, I don't care if it's my father. If he don't have the works of his faith, I'm sorry. I hope that is what you asked for. That why we knitted it in to revelations and um brothers is saying they believe everything the lamb that stepped forward and blood and all they believe all that but they just don't have the oil condition. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the condition. Okay. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Apostle. Surely we can agree with what you always quote the scripture where you say you've dug deep and drank strange waters. Once again, that scripture is made manifest. I think um for me it makes it a prophetic message. Surely makes it a prophetic message apostle. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it does. It does. And and the beauty part, Edgar, is not that we feel like that. The fact is it is like that. You cannot have the seventh seal and it's not prophetic. That's why they make such a bigger mistake. They say the seventh seal is silence. Brother Bam says is silence in heaven but activity on the earth. What activity? 10 virgins. Look at that activity. And you'll hear Friday the activity that has gone on by supernatural insight. What has gone on there in Matthew 25? the activity that went on there that it really blows your mind when you just read it. My brother B says we in a prophetic class. That's why we can't say this is prophetic, you know. and seeing it with a prophetic eye, you can look between the lines and realize what has gone on here, which is what we want to bring out. Um, on the 10th, Friday, October, what's written in between the lines to everybody else, it looked like crooked lines. But God likes to write straight on crooked lines. So I hope I answered the question. &gt;&gt; No, thank you Apostle. Um that concludes my questions. I thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. And then um I just want to say again I feel really excited. I mean we have a lot of meetings that we are going to handle until November, but I feel that um this one uh this Friday is going to be one of my pet seminates. And that's the reason I believe it is the greatest message that was ever preached in the end time message. So pray for the meeting and um look into what I tried to tell you about the oil and by prophetic insight you'll see that the oil is the Holy Ghost which is the dynamic dynamics and the dynamics change your body for the rapture and they went in. How did they go in? The oil changed their bodies but the foolish virgins bodies wasn't changed. And that's why brother Bam says what happens to them for the thousand years. He says they are in the grave. But because of the oil, our bodies is changed. If the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, it will change quicken your mortal bodies and then you can go in cuz flesh and blood doesn't go in. They will really change when the foolish virgins went to go look for oil. Can you see how prophetic this thing is? &gt;&gt; So may God bless you. I dropped a lot of the little things that uh but uh this is worth dropping again in any sermon. Thank you, Edgar. I hope I answered your questions and I hope uh I answered a lot of other questions. Amen. [Music] Heat up [Music] here. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
