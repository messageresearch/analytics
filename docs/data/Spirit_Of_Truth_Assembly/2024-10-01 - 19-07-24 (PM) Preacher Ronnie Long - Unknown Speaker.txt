[Music] need good it's Anon to be preaching greting from back home Tabernacle brother Wayne wanted to be here tonight Satan is on the attack some of you pastors know sometimes your post of Duty as Pastor overrides the other commitments that you [Music] make he said each and every one of you Psalms the 23r chap [Music] we just preach is that right put down just put [Music] down the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want somebody say I shall not want he make to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he leaded me in the paths of righteousness for his name's [Music] sake y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff that comfort me amen [Music] th preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest thou anointest my head with oil my and surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord amen God bless his word tonight you can have your seats I want to just speak for if we have a title tonight dress for a bank we're dressed for a bank now we read Psalm 23 since we were children we read this scripture no doubt we could recite my heart and this scripture is about the great Shepherd right and we serve a great Shepherd and you might have thought that you made your own decisions in your life but the great Shepherd has been leading and guiding every decision that you made even when you made the wrong decision he's still the great sheer you would have walked away from him still the great sheer matter what you would do he's still a great shepher and you would probably not be here if it was up to your choice but you're still here tonight you didn't drive all the way from Carolina all the way from Cincinnati all the way across the bridge by just your own will but there's something greater at work tonight the great shepher he's the great Shepherd over us no matter what we're going through no matter what we feel like no matter what our life looks like no matter how big the bank account is he's still the great sheer every one of us that has given our heart to the Lord we have agreed to allow our decision to fall away and let the shepherd lead us let this great Shepherd lead us in our lives lead us in our decisions lead us in how we raise our families lead us in what we do on a Friday evening if it was by my choice I wouldn't be here tonight but there was a greater Shepherd that brought me here tonight it was by my own intellect my own desires I wouldn't have come tonight but there's a greater Shepherd that's over my life and even what I would have left him he has led me here to his word even though you would have given up you're still here tonight I'm sure I'm sure that this trip just went off just super easy and there was no there was no problems with you didn't forget anything you know you didn't you didn't there was no issues driving all that way didn't have any traffic nobody made you mad in traffic but yet you overcame all of the because there's a great shepher that's leing you in your that's leading you in your life there's someone over all of this and there's a great Shepherd over your situation tonight you might think that you're the only one going through your particular situation and that's just how the devil would like it he would let you to think that you're walking through the valley of the shadow of death by yourself all on your own nobody understands where you're at nobody understands where you're going on the trial that you're facing tonight but you didn't go through that Valley on your own he led you through the valley of the shadow of death so you're not there by yourself but there's somebody that's leading you through that Valley now why would this great Shepherd lead us into the valley of the shadow of there because there's something on the other side of that Valley that he wants us to have there's something on the other side of that that he sees a perfect view can I say it like this God in his mind sees of you that you're not there yet right does that make sense right is that translate okay there's a you that God sees in his mind and you're not there yet so the great Shepherd is leading you to that you he's leading you to that perfect picture of you that he has in his mind he not so much just leading us to what he thinks will happen but he already sees a perfect picture of us and he's leading us to Perfection be ye perfect even as your father is perfect how would we ever be perfect in this Fallen flesh but he's leading us to something he's leading us somewhere he didn't just leave us at the River Jordan he didn't just leave us at the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he's leading us to somewhere it's the Perfection of the church you might not feel like it but there's a perfect you you might not recognize it tonight but there's a perfect view and if we can just put on God's glasses for a moment tonight just put on God's vision of us God doesn't see the mistakes that you think he sees he doesn't see the errors that you think he sees but when God looks at you he's looking through the blood of Christ so he sees a perfect sacrifice so he's not looking at your error he's looking at a perfect sacrifice I know we're just backgrounding a little bit bu I hope we're okay tonight is that okay I know that long road trips can be hard on you I'm going to best that we just stay awake you got to stand up stand up we're going to use this room house the Lord tonight I it's okay it's a banquet hall I dressed for a banet I [Applause] prepared something before you can get to the bank you have to go through something before you can arrive to the T but it wouldn't be a victory if we just showed up at the table we said feed me but through the trial of our faith we're arriving at this B we're coming to the king's feast tonight and and we look at this scripture Psalms Psalms 23 thou preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemies it's puzzling to me why would God prepare a table with all of your enemies there anybody that you've ever had beef with i for the top of anybody that's ever crossed your path in the wrong way and here your shepher has prepared a table of all of them imagine you walking into a room and every enemy you have is sitting at this table it' be pretty troubling right and we're probably putting physical attributes in this so and so sit there there she's sitting there she's sitting there you know but it's not that kind of table David's not talking about physical persecution David's talking about and the Lord prepared a table for David in the presence of his enemies now why would God set up a banquet for all of your enemies for all of David's enemies but there would have to be a purpose behind this right there would have to be a reason behind this God wouldn't just have you sit at a table full of all of your opposition for no reason but God has gathered together all of David's enemies for one purpose so that David can overcome all of his enemies you God hased all together for one purpose because there will be an overom will be there will be a group ofies overcome eny work will be [Applause] over I don't want toarch let God gather together all of my enemies and I say it's a set up it's a set up it's a trap it's a trap God gathered together all of David's enemies because he was going to kill them all right at the same time he was going to gather together all B tries all together at the same because it was a trap let me say to you tonight you probably drug some things in here tonight you probably drug some doubt in here tonight maybe there's some cancer in here maybe there's some diabetes maybe there's some some maybe there's some worries some grief some grief in here but it's a TR the devil has come you are the theil came here the devil came here to die he came here into a trap yes so you might have thought you were heavy laden and downed but you had to bring him here it's a trap it's an appointment and God never misses his appointment God made a divine you might have just thought today well I just come to that meeting CU I have nothing better to do but God had this in mind before the foundation of the world he saw you going through your trial and he set up a banquet he said I'll meet them there at that appoint in time Friday evening they'll come in heavy L they'll walk out of [Applause] pray for pray for him sorry from the other just getting ready for get ready for all right first night it's always a little technical set up amen praise the Lord amen good so brother brandom says it like this we're in the channel of mortality this is the only time that you'll be mortal this is the only time that you'll have a chance to praise him as a mortal this is the only time that you'll have the chance to overthrow the devil as a moral this is the only season of mortality for you because where we're going we're not we're not Mortals where we're going we're going to have an immortal body where we're going we're going to have a glorified body so this is your only chance as a mort now as we drop into this channel mortality for time sake I'm not going to read a lot tonight but if you want the ques I've got brother I've got brother says that we're dropped into this realm of mortality for just a season for just a moment and what we do in this moment of mortality is influenced by what we're feeding he would tell the story of the the chief right the the Indian chief well I have a black not white the story I'll explain it there's a few that don't brother B has an interaction with an old CH and the chief tells him I have a battle going on inside and I I I I don't know who's going to win the battle he says I have a black dog and a white dog and and and and they're fighting to have ninous in my mind and brother said well whatever dog you feed the most right if you feed the black dog the black dog will have the dominance if you Fe the white dog pretty simple right but in this realm of mortality we're in the same type of battle and what influence we lean to is what's going to win the fight now as as a mortal we can be influenced by only two things we either influenced by God or the devil we can't have both we're either influenced by God or the devil it's either good or evil right so if we narrow that down it's pretty easy to discern where our influence is coming from it's either good or it's evil if we want to win on the good side we feed the good side if we want to go to hell we feed the evil side right well I don't think anybody in here came tonight because we want to go to hell but we want to have a victory and so if we feed the Victorious do then we have a victory over that do it's by the influence now we can be influenced by man and we can be influenced by denomination we can be influenced by a lot of rails but when you break it down there's only two places that influence can come from God or the devil and when you divide that up you recognize right away I'm not really following the influence when I'm looking at all of the issues going on [Music] all of the problems going on brother you've been in the message a minut you've been in the message a while you've seen some people come and some people go you see problems arise and problems come and problems go now when we start looking at all the problems we get influenced by those problems there's an influence that comes when we look at all the questions all of the wonderings and there's an influence that comes by that and we don't even recognize that's what's going on on but there's an influence behind those problems and if we start focusing on the problems then that's not feeding the white do but that's feeding those problems and the more voice we give those problems the more power they have and the further them yet see now you're being used to influence the devil's information we don't want to do that God's not a critical spirit God doesn't criticize everything that goes on so if we're voicing criticism we know where that's coming from we know the influence that we're under right and there's a spirit that comes behind every influence and we may not recognize it in totality but it just comes down to either good or evil God or the dev and I choose to be influenced by the word of God we can have questions we can have Fellowship you're not going to agree on every single point but at the end of the day I choose to be influenced by the word God because if I was under my own influence I wouldn't be standing here T I would be calling dead somewhere and got her somewhere somewhere not influence but God had an influence over my life the great Shepherd has been watching over me and as we give into his influence he is guiding us to the perect picture of us he's guiding us to that Perfection that weing for but we're going to have these trials in our lives of which influence we're going to fall under I I okay if I just tell this testimony come me there there's a brother that I know um I don't want to use any names but he had some questions arise in his church people began to question things question what about this what about this what about this is this true or is this not true look at this information this information you know every time that the critical spirit arises it's never originated at that person they heard it from somebody else they heard this thing from somebody else they didn't that question on their own but they heard it from somebody else they didn't arve it that of their own somebody influenc that this is wrong and this is wrong that's not right that's not right I know I'm a deacon at home everybody comes to me with their with their issues and their problems you know what if I don't go under the word I don't take it back to the word I become prone to listen to the influence of everybody else I to see all the issues see all the issues as as an eagle you have vision and you can see the issues and you can see the problems and you can see the The Faults and the failures because you have Eagle Vision but it's what you do with that it's what you do with seeing those issues that makes you an overcome so this brother to take in a lot of this criticism and and somebody said well this there's you know all these questions about the message and all these questions about what you believe you know this this man he he he was the pastor's son at this time and he thought well I'll go I'll go I'll just go study this out come on brother so I can I can you know know the questions for myself I'll just go research this out and it's not going to hurt me but but I need to know so that I can combat you see right away we recognize what influence that he's under so he pulls up one night his kids have gone to bed this is true story and his kids have gone to bed and and he gets on the computer he to look through some of these things he oh that's easy and I explain that after a while that influence he to wear down his face and he to look at some things and say maybe there is some truth to this and he said as soon as he said those words a spirit a manifested spirit out of the computer and started flying around his room now you might not believe in the Supernatural I've come way too far I know that these things I know that these Spirits are real and it started terrorizing his flying around the room he got he got up beside himself as soon as that Spirit came out his girls upstairs started screaming and his wife started screaming and there was an anointing that came into his house and he tried to rebuke it he said in the name of Jesus and he said that demon looked like a bull like a dark black bull crossed its arms he said it was that moment I realized I had lost I had lost the power in the name of Christ because I had begin to doubt and right there where he began to doubt he lost the influence that he was under came under this influence and his wife began to scream out she called the pastor he just Liv a couple doors down this was his son's house and and and the son's trying to cast this thing out it's just terring the comes in the door he says I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah now what was it one was influenced by reason and one was influenced by the message one was influenced by his imagination his conscience and one was influenced by Jesus Christ now there's been a banquet summon here tonight it's the greatest battle ever fought it's taking place in your life your reason your conscience your memory your affection are all that battle tonight but there's something greater than those influence there's something deeper down than that and if we can get to that influence down there we can overcome or I moving too fast we can overcome that we all have memory we all have reason but they're not always right that's right your reason will be wrong your memory will be wrong we can have a recollection of this night as our memories all be different your memory can be wrong your conscience can be wrong some people have a conscience to do what you never dream their conscience is wrong so we cannot rely on those high things but there must be an overthrow there must be one king you can't have five Kings there's got to be one king there's got to be one ruler over all that we go through one influence over all of our lives and this ruler this king is the king of all [Music] Kings every sickness subject under this King there is nothing too great that this King can't overcome and I think it's time as the Church of the Living God that we recognize which king we're serving we're not just serving some King come on we're serving goding [Applause] [Music] [Applause] God I think treat this like it has full Authority oh I would I wish that God was powerful enough no not my king my [Applause] [Music] is my king is power to take all of every King in Kingdom this world under captivity my king I recogniz it's our King one time there was a king traveling through the land with his soldiers and and they stopped and and asked the peasant on the side of the road what can your king do for youall he said well I'm I'm hung i' like a I'd like a chicken the king just rode out l didn't give him nothing just pushed him off to the side shows up there's another begger there he said what can your king do for you oh yeah I I really like a horse keep just riding down past it finally he comes to a b and the King says what can your king do for you and that guy says I want your horse I want a chicken I want I want I want half your Palace I want up to half your kingdom I want gold I want riches I want my house restored I want everything that I have need of in this life paid for and that King said Give It Up to half my kingdom and the solders said why would you do that why would you not give those that ask for a chicken or ask for a horse this gu ask for all that and more and you're going to give it to him and he said because he's the first one that recognized my authority [Applause] all that we can imagine it's greater than our imagination we got some pretty big imagination but greater than that what is the greatest thing you think God can do in this place greater than that promise toer than that see I'm the influence of angel I know what this I know auth I'm not just asking I got Authority where Authority is it has to be done you got a checkbook that whatever you write it to it has to be done there is nothing too hard for God too great for God we just got to exercise our fath outside of our imagination outside of our reason I won't take the time to read it but you know Joshua the 10th chapter he goes into the valley of aelon and he destroys every Giant in that but yet he saves five Kings they run from him cuz they know the power that he has and they run into this cave you know what he said seal them off Seal off that cave until I have time to deal with but at the right time in the evening time we're going to roll that stone back and we're going to deal with those five KS we're going to have those five King come out you know what's the suggestion Joshua didn't kill the he called all of his men and he said bring me the five Kings now these were five giants that were the kings of all of that Kingdom at the time and he didn't just kill him he called his men to come up he said you read this Josh 1226 and he says five Kings out and I want the men of God and I I want them to put their foot on the I think it's time to roll [Applause] away ownership it's Authority it's it's it's it's it's something God has already given to thech we're not asking for it go and take your land who land your land tonight go and take your house Mas take your children daddies take back your house take back what the devil [Applause] he didn't ask I wonder if this is mine it was his God had already given it to him be like somebody coming here Tak my phone and walk I don't have to ask them I don't have to he Polie that's mine you remember when you had Joy you remember when you had victory somebody came in took it from you you don't have to ask to the [Applause] [Music] enem oh I don't want to be I don't want to be too bold this is the time to be bold ask abundantly that choice not this is the to it's the evening [Applause] time it's time for all other kings to fade away and there to be one king you've been summoned to obey en but who's at the head of the table thou preparest table I'll be with you there's a greater Authority than the Affliction that you're going there's a greater King in the land just how you feel there's a greater King in the land than how you can see yourself God sees you in perfect pictory do you see yourself there amen though I walk Valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou the beginning God what was he light loose Hallelujah and he was the light of men in the beginning he said let there be and there was let there be and there was let there be and there was what was that he was destroying darkness and wherever there was Darkness light came in and darkness had to leave whereever light is Darkness cannot exist Darkness only runs in after light has walked out light comes back up Darkness has to leave Darkness has to go [Applause] a David could say I will walk through the valley the shadow of the greatest enemy that man has ever known I will not fear because L has come no matter how dark your situation is he's your life I'm this one for my pastor we have a picture of the pillar with the prophet messenger underneath he said we thank God that a light came this AG but today one of those men is not here but the other one still here one of those men is not here but the other one still one of those men's not here today but that has always been here [Applause] [Applause] walk in the light when you are children of the light and you may not know it but when you walk into somewhere there's a light above you you may not know there's a light that HS over your head you may wonder why everybody looks at your somebody catches your side ey what is it there's a light there they may not see it never light is Darkness cannot exist that's why when you come into a place Spirits seem to get rled up they get fired up because there's coming in light is breaking through and spirit to one another you remember the said he said the spirits I can hear him crying out there's one with depression and there's depression and they're crying out to each other why they're asking for help because the light is coming let me say tonight the light has come down and there is no amount of Darkness I don't heav I I don't care how the I think it's time to treat him like a king treat him like who he is our God our God our God is a consuming fire that's around no Darkness can in his presence for he's consuming fire I've seen God working I've seen God move I know what my can do I've seen the preaching of the word I've seen fulfillment while pet yet spake these words they were filled with the Holy Ghost I witnessed that in my life I witnessed the preaching of the Gospel destroy cancer with my own eyes I witnessed stand while the preacher was preaching while the preacher was preaching and the tumor fall out of my king is King cancer is not my king anxiety is not nervousness is not mying my king is King [Applause] iog a woman one time that recognized her King no matter what the critics said she had to get to Jesus Through the Hall of critics wasn't worthy shouldn't have been in there walking through a table of everybody in that room knew what she was who she was what she does she doesn't belong in here right but it was a trap imagine brother Roberto how much we in condemnation she battled to get into that room how much was on her to get into that room I imagine she walked in that room probably didn't want to look up but she had to get to Jesus no matter what anybody else was say she had to get to Jesus and I imagine that after he told her thy sins are all forg imag she there a little different than she with a little
