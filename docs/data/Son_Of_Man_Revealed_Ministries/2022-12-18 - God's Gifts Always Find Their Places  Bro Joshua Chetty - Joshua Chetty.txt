the heart of God remind me to feel his present this morning amen you can feel that the song leader caught up in the presence of God what will make a man weep in the prayers of God amen only God himself coming and working that and we feel his presence amen that's how it is we don't come to a cold formal religion we've come to something that is real the Holy Spirit has become tangible to us amen the holy spirit is here amongst us we feel his presence we know when he's moving amongst us amen and that's what we want we want the Holy Spirit to move amongst us to move amongst his people hallelujah and when he does that then you know that this is not we're not talking about a historical Jesus amen but he's talking about Jesus that is amongst us amen we don't want some cold formal religion but we want Jesus Christ in the way he's working today we want Jesus in the now amen when they have a praise in Jesus Christ amen amen amen you got your Bible this morning I'm going to turn to Luke chapter 1 verse 1. [Music] sorry Luke chapter 2 verse one [Music] and he came to pass in those days then they went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that's going to be history of Nazareth into Judea and to the city of David which is called Mary is a so we know that Mary was about in the stage of a pregnancy to deliver and so it was that while they were there the days we accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth the firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the Inn will turn also to Romans 8 28. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose Emmanuel may be seated so we find here this morning we're going to speak on think that it's just Christmas season and we look at the world carrying on in the in this great commercial move of Christmas where the commercial world makes the most money this part of the year amen and it becomes a like a a season of frenzy and he took away the true meaning of what the true Christmas was really supposed to be and the world is in such a frenzy when everybody talks about Christmas the last thing is on them on their mind is about Christ we know the history that firstly this was a Christian uh Christmas is not a was not a Protestant holiday it was originated from the care from Catholicism yes because they were pagans worshiping the sun god and they thought they could incorporate into that sun god worship which was worshiping Jupiter when they were pagans they could worship their son and make Jesus celebration on the same day that's why it's called the price Mass so we know all that but we find that even then the Protestant took this on but and they instead of being sincere about it and thinking about Christ he does now become so commercialized and that's why they even take out the word Christ and put the word Xmas and everything is become around Santa Claus and things like that and all about partying and drinking and all these things that are going on everything that you see there but there was a true Christmas there was a real Christmas amen there was one Christmas one Christmas gift a true Christmas gift and the only Christmas gift would you believe be for the Salvation of mankind which was all in God's Plan of Redemption amen that because God of man's Fallen condition God at 14 that he will come and manifest himself upon the Earth to save Fallen man that's what the Bible said for God so loved the world because that's his world his children all that he cared about all that he loved he knew that he had to save his world yes and he gave his only begotten son amen amen that whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but I have everlasting life amen because outside of Christ everyone will perish the only way to have eternal life is through Jesus Christ could come to Jesus and after achieving all the accolades of life after having religion after having all the wealth of the world after following the law he still was not satisfied because he knew he was going to perish because he wants to know how do I achieve this eternal life but the way it was provided for him he couldn't accept it and we know what happened in the end of his story he opened his eyes in hell so we're going to speak on this morning God's gifts always find their places amen and for a subtitle this morning we say the Creator in his own creation for his creation amen because God himself the Creator and to come and fashion himself like man and he had to form his own creation amen nothing else could save mankind but God himself amen yes yes not the second person of the Trinity as the Catholic Church puts it no God himself amen God is spirits and a spirit he cannot die as Purity cannot bleed and spirit he cannot be a savior but he had all his attributes in him and he had to create a body amen a body let us proof aside already by the prophet desire a virgin shall conceive but if you had to become a time where this world had to be manifested there to be a memory upon the Earth dare to be a person that when the Angels spoke to her she said be it unto me according to Thy word amen amen there to be a virgin whom yes amen and she had to have faith to believe what the Angels had said to her and she had to accept what the angel said to her amen and then Mary's womb became a borrowed womb I'm not talking about Mary had no partiness except their faith and believing what the angel said but a body a womb was just a borrowed womb because the Bible says when she believed what when she accepted what the angel said the Bible said the Holy Ghost over Shadow there and she conceived of that Holy One amen amen so she had a complete embryo from dinner amen and she had no part to play in depth because why God himself amen the Creator formed his own creation for who for you and I oh thank you for his creation thank you Lord because why because of his creation Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden it became a fallen race and Adam forfeited the title leads right there in the Garden of Eden because prior to that Adam had authority over the Earth that's right amen Adam and power over all the years yes he called Animals by their name he could he could place mountains in their places he had the power to speak the word yes but all this was forfeited because of sin but all this was not unknown to God all it was part of God's plan because he had the attributes and he had to manifest that attributes amen whatever God is he has to manifest it amen because that's not God has to manifest every attribute of his and the same thing today God Is A Healer so he must manifest that healing words so why we don't use ask God when we need healing for him to manifest his word he wants to manifest the word you got someone that's lost in your family you got a loved one that's lost ask God to manifest his word as a savior amen that's his attributes he's a Healer he's a savior he's a Creator when he was here on the earth when he brought the from his own creation they brought the bread they brought the fishes from his own creation he was creating he took from his own creation and he created more and more he multiplied it but he said major things than this shall you do amen yes until we know that there was a time on the Earth when the prophet was here something that wasn't created he could speak that's right and the squirrels came amen so what was God showing us all the time that he as a Creator created his own creation for his creation amen amen I mean you find that God's gifts always find their places yes now it might have seemed a hurting Mary is in almost about to give birth but now they'll have to travel from Nazareth where they were living all the way to the birthplace in Bethlehem yes at that time it must have been a like a pressure on Joseph and Mary something that is pressurizing them under this Roman government under this Roman rule what a pressure Mary's about to give birth now I must take her and put on upon a donkey and I must go and travel all the way to Judea in Bethlehem but all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord according to his purpose because the scripture must be fulfilled thank you Lord because Christ must come from the lineage of David yes and that's where David was from Bethlehem and if you go and trace it back there it goes all the way to rehab and the great General that she married Salman will beget boys and because and boys began opened and Obed beget Jesse and Jesse beget David and if you follow the lineage that's the way it comes all the way from Caleb actually where when George Joshua was dividing the land from Caleb's son and then he came then little town came deadlier hmm so you trace the lineage all the way there was a reason there to go there but you see but the angel of God was directing them it might seem that the Roman the Roman government is coming with a hard rule by the angel of God was fixing things because why things might happen according to God purpose God's Gift must find its places amen and you're the greatest gift that was going to come to mankind it's now prior to Jesus being born at that time I could imagine the time they're traveling there and it must have been a very tiring Journey it would it wouldn't have been an easy Journey when Mary about to give birth he must have been a hard journey they must have stopped around the places and Joseph must have stopped and made many rests and they began to ponder upon the little Teenage life how they were living in Judea and honest to play in the place and they began to think about their hometown but all this time Mary noticed his staff that was following them and she must have said Joseph did you notice that stuff and he said he must have said oh and then he noticed it and he said no she said no but it was falling out all the time because why the stars that should be aligned because this wasn't just any Star this was a super sign amen this wasn't a normal star he's a bright and Morning Star amen the old cause of History was gonna change in a few moments imagine from the time the sun sets and then the star began to follow them but little did he know at that time that the cause of man of History everything in history is going to change all those demons that were amongst the people had them in bondage when Jesus was going to come upon the Earth those demons that were hiding carrying on amongst the people we're now going to be exposed Redemption plan was in progress amen the creator of life was going to come in human flesh and the Bible says now remember at that time as they were coming just entering into Bethlehem you know coming up they're coming from down desert going up towards Bethlehem amen we are coming from our many walks of life coming from all our systems of life and we didn't realize it we are wondering why we have to go along a life Journey a certain way maybe we went through some hardships maybe we went to some troubling times but we didn't realize that God was preserving us all the time because why God always preserve his gifts yes to find their places God has kept us for this hour Maybe there was a time where you're your parents had to meet at a specific time maybe for some reason if you ask them the history maybe they wouldn't have met but they said to some reason they met maybe they they could have added early debt and they're saying what thank God I got saved I should have died early but you had to come on the Earth go there to make sure you have to come in a certain time and season and we find that the same thing today that no matter what yes Joseph and Mary traveling now and they're coming to Bethlehem and all the the town the the the places where people will come and launch was filled up because everybody is coming now for this taxation there was a pressure on the people amen now all this is happening before Jesus is manifested in the flesh there's a pressure coming upon the people before Jesus manifested in the flesh a pressure coming from Rome upon the people yes and we find that they couldn't find a place because all the places were building you know like you must have experienced that here when it comes to holiday season or maybe they're having some big convention in the country all hotels are full and you can't get a place you can't get a booking so just like that they couldn't get a place there was no room for him but it was ordained that way yes because yes the Lamb of God that will come as a sacrifice for mankind yes amen foreign you will come to save mankind amen and he had to come in a place where Lambs were born amen because he was the Lamb of God yes yes amen and he had to find a place in the stable where the Lambs were born and then when the when Jesus was born they had nothing to wrap him up because he didn't come prepared to get their baby clothes like how you have now where the baby clothes is ready before you give birth they had nothing prepared for him but it was ordained by God they will use something that they use for the ox the swaddling clocks that they put upon the ox's neck so that dogs don't get all bruised up when it locks it tighter and they put that they covered Jesus for that but he was the creator of life would humble himself and come in that fashion who is meant to have pride yes yes who is the man to be proud for when he the creator of Life can come and give service to mankind amen amen and he was wrapped in his warning clocks there he was God presented his gift to mankind wrapped in swirling clocks something that nobody will even who would even think of using that for the child something that's smelling something that is from an animal but God used it to type here's the sacrifice I come to do you just for you this is my love for you my unconditional love the Creator in his own creation for his creation and a prophet saying the first thing this was God this Jesus was God in the form of man that art for people to swallow that even today that he was God that's what he was he wasn't nothing less than God amen amen he was God manifested in flesh yes amen because hug and go die as a spirit yet to form his own create his own flesh that's why he was the first firstborn of the new creation amen this creation wasn't an ordinary creation he didn't take man and woman God himself formed that body amen this wasn't you or Gentile yes he came from the Lilith but he had nothing to do with the Jew agenda God formed that body foreign he wasn't nothing less than God he was God manifested in flesh he was the creator in his own creation this is our Prophet saying this he was a Creator in his creation by the creation for the creation he was a Creator in his creation by his creation for his creation all wings right all wines right back in God the whole thing fullness of God he was the creator in so much that he was God and he was a being on earth a being of time which means that he must add a beginning therefore he created himself a body to live in yes God himself created a body for himself amen that by this creation it might save the Lost creation that he had created so thank you Lord what creation the body that he created Yeah by that body that he come he could use that he could come now through that body as a fashion like unto man to redeem man because he had to come and do the work of Faith kinsman redeemer amen because he loved us so much yes he had to say this creation yes yes amen thank you now therefore God created himself with body he was a Creator and created his own creation that by this creation he might save them that were lost in his creation that you and I creatures of time we only come into this time element because man stepped into sin and death brought into the time element that's right and now to come out of the time element you've got to step into the word that come from eternity amen because God himself comes from eternity in life fashion unto men and started the work of redemption yet about two thousand years ago but he come this day back in the form of the word and now we step into the word amen and we go into that word image that's going to take us into eternity amen amen and deliver you all of being a creature of time yes amen yes amen [Music] thank you that's why you're fighting each one of you you are youthful in your thinking no matter how old you're getting your thinking is always youthful because you always want to be young amen amen because why are you not meant to be old amen some people say at your age be your age you're older but really thinking each one of us we always think we're young in our mind so we're forgetting that his body is decaying his body is dying daily but because in us we're longing and groaning for that body change yes because we are not meant to die we are not meant to Decay that became because of our fallen condition but we thank God when the word goes open to us and the Word was revealed to us we began to understand God's Plan of Redemption yes we began to understand the true salvation the true meaning of Christmas amen so we realized that Christmas is not just a happy go lucky time oh for himself but he's talking about a very time he's not about drinking he's not about partying he's not just having a temporary time of being happy you know now this is the time where people are happy why can't it be like that all the time yes the reason why they can't be like that all the time they are now going into a there's a spirit yes the spirit of Christmas upon them that keeps them this way but if you got the Holy Ghost you're always there amen you always have love yeah you don't always have joy you won't be a temporary person that's happy yes amen yes on a Christmas day you want to laugh and joke and carrying on with everybody or you want to invite everyone to your home you want to go talk nicely to the neighbor you want to talk nicely to the person on the streets yeah but when you go to Nature change amen when you have the new birth there's a nature change yeah deliver you from that Old nature from that Old sticky nature amen there's a transformation that takes place inside of you now that's what Jesus come to do he didn't just he come to be the sacrifice people want to look at him in the manger they want to look at him 2000 years ago but the reason why he come in the first place was to die he didn't come to live he come to die amen he come to be the sacrifice that's why we find the wise man the three wise men the Magi well we're astronomers of the day in that day studying the Stars they picked up he has a different type of stuff in this constellation and they began to follow the star from the time Jesus was born but it wasn't a one-day Journey as we saw the star let's go and see him now they began to leave the East coming from India traveling on all those camels was an easy Journey they picked up the gifts and it gives wasn't normal gift amen he brought gold who spoke would resembles the deity of Jesus they brought frankincense who spoke about Jesus service to Jehovah it spoke about myrrh spoke about his deaths amen these were the gifts they were bringing and the journey wasn't an easy Journey it was a two-year Journey amen coming all the way from from India all the way to Judea foreign but God preserved those gifts amen because God gives must find their places and we find that when they came they came to the headquarters of Jerusalem trying out where is he born King of the Jews where is he the king of the Jews went to every street going through every alley and nobody knew nothing until it is caught the attention of Ellen and yet it will call all the priests and so forth those that study the law and they brought the books and they found that in a place called Bethlehem amen amen Christ shall be born amen and in the message why Bethlehem the prophet said Bethlehem stands for the house of God's bread and he was the bread of God brought down from heaven amen hmm so we find that every even a place even the name of the play even the place had a symbolic meaning yes amen and that's what the same place and you know David also type Christ David were one day when he was longing for water from Bethlehem because Bethlehem is where you go and with the sheep and things like that one day when he's thirsty and he wants some good water thinking about the water from Bethlehem Warriors there is a was faithful to the king they knew that this King needed this and we have to bring it because they was giving their service to the king but there were garrisoned they will upset the way to get that water amen but nothing will stop them amen amen they will go and possess the gates of the enemy because they have to bring this to David's but when you bring it David said how can I drink this now and he gives it as a sacrifice to God how will we coming to this world to get to get to the house of God's bread how the denomination try to keep us away how they try to get us away from this word of God yeah to try to Kill the Messenger speak bad about the messenger call this message account and so forth yeah you can kill the messenger but you can't kill the message amen a message will find his way yes amen because this is not a message that comes from a man just come down from God Amen this comes down from the articles of the most thy God yes amen amen seven angels brought down this message come and beat come through the time barrier yes that's why there was such a loud noise because it broke the sound barrier amen They Come From Another Dimension come with this message through a prophet because the word of the Lord must come through a prophets and come and deliver it to us amen and we find that here comes this major is they come to Earth and you know what he asked him let's go to Matthew chapter 2 reading from verse 1. now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold became wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying crazy that is born King of the Jews for we have City star in the east and I come to worship Him when Herod the king had heard this thing he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not art not the least among the princes of Judah for all of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel and every 20th privately called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appears see what he's asking him what time the star appeared because there's a reason for him to ask what time because he don't know how the child is already born so he wants to know when exactly was this that they noticed to stop and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young see that's saying a baby see what he's saying yes after he found out what time the star appeared he's saying now he said go and search diligently for the young child yes and when you have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also and when they had heard the king they departed and know the star which they saw in the East went before them until he came out and saw the star again now until he came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star the Rejoice with exceeding great joy and when they were coming to the alt they saw the young child would marry his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh and being one of God in a dream you see they were led by God first yes and now God is speaking to them in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way so stop there so you see what happened here Ellen is asking him what time it is so when what time they supposed to stop and therefore it gives a decree that all those from two years and under must be killed but you'll find that immediately after that in from verse 13 when they Departed the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph because God is always preserving his gifts to amen amen you can never until your work on Earth is done God will always preserve your life yes and if God wants to speak a word to his church he will bring that gift through his faithful Ministry yes and nothing will stop that word from coming forth amen IA no matter how many Islams May Come no matter how much theology may come in a message in the word God will still find a way to bring his words he will preserve that gift yes and will keep that gift in line with what he wants done with his word amen amen they have to be a balance in the world we cannot come and present our own Gospel yes we've got to present the gospel the way it's supposed to be just like in the days of Jesus they couldn't accept the fact why are you coming out of Bethlehem why are they why not from Jerusalem yeah why not from another place why not to the lineage of the Pharisees or the Sadducees why in a Manger why not from the high priest Palace why not from herod's Palace but scripture had to be fulfilled you have to come to the lineage of David amen and if you follow that lineage Ray of theology is involved in there [Music] look at that you think now you're looking at that the prophet said that girl maybe because of ungodly parents because of a little beauty that you had and you get some money must have put out in the streets because of a condition that you were living in they had to put out on the street because of a pretty face but the same girl will save her parents people of her faith amen because when Jericho was about to be destroyed and everyone was shaking within themselves fear fell upon the people she said she preserved those five amen he preserved the spices saved them and they would in return to save her and the family and because she was chosen to be in the same linen yeah the Christ will come amen amen but God works in mischievous yes you might say yourself I'm not the popular people of the world I'm a little nobody oh I don't go to the popular Church they got big names in the message big creatures preaching big things and you expect to hear Revolution coming out from there but God can work in a little room amen that's when when the Seven Seals was being preached the prophet was in a little room night after night the angel would come yes preparing the seals not knowing what the seals was at that time but he's preparing his message and the angel will come and reveal it to him amen revelation after revelation don't look at things the things of God the way man looks at it amen amen amen God works in Simplicity Hallelujah rather be faithful than what God has put unto you and don't look at it like the way man look at it yes yes amen because God don't work in the victory God doesn't work in a pump now you're fine people are getting ready for the big Christmas services big Cathedral beautiful musicians beautiful orchestras all those things speaking about Jesus singing beautiful songs you couldn't pick a fault with the keys the cling you couldn't be a speaker pick a form with a voice but Christ is not in it because it's not on the church they left him outside the church yes amen but God gives always find their dreams amen beat in a little room beat out there beat on a one-to-one evangelism and God gives final places yes amen and we find that the wise men when the Lord spoke to them in a dream they went away they went another way the origin of the degree they decree to kill the children but Joseph and Mary was instructed to live amen God had to preserve the gift now we know what happened in our day once again when the stars were aligned once again when the stars were aligned on April the 6th 1909 God's Prophet was born amen the pull of fire nothing for thousand years was back on the Earth again amen back on the Earth again because why now God will show that his work of redemption is still going on he didn't stop at Calvary amen they come to do the work of redemption now is a time where he's coming to put claim upon those that He redeemed but he must come and work through a prophet amen and the life that could have been taken away right there in the snow right there in the cabin when his mother Adam the cabin there with no food no fire somehow the neighbor will see this this house no smoke is coming up there let me go get him some wood let me get him some food and preserve the life amen amen God's gifts will always find other places yes and then this Prophet will go along his journey and we know what happened along the journey he loses his daughter he loses his wife and he decides to shoot himself and the gun wouldn't go off decides to blow up his brain that he wouldn't go up but yet when he shoot it again goes off then he goes to Electric pole one day try to electrocute himself and on that type of current he would have been dead instantly he'd been fried up but God preserved his life and the gift said to go around the world it was rejected but he had to be stored up or would you season and in due season the Holy Ghost will come and reignite that word and bring it back and God always works with men when you speak about the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is working through men the Holy Ghost just come there and work the Holy Ghost is that speak he's speaking with man and now he brings that faithful ministry will read that same word you bring it in the present truth and it'll make sense of it amen amen guess what the faithful ministry will do make sense of it but God had to preserve is how did God bring about foreign this word was thrown up the prophet is not on the scene yeah how would men young men take this word without the prophet being there to interpret that word now amen to explain to them that word you just stood up and they took it and they studied it and they began to preach amen because why this is the Holy Ghost word yes amen because we know that somebody is here the angel of God is yeah amen working amongst the people amen and we can say today we have seen the stuff and we've come to worship him yes amen we recognize amen the super sign in this day we recognize his presence in this day and we have come to worship Him amen and we find that God has come there and Christ has come and he's come to redeem mankind he says that's the reason that God does nothing outside of a man he always works through a man because he has to use a man and man is what he had to use to display attribute of Savior he had to make him in his image make him something like him and put him on a free model agency and let him act any way he wanted to he could take his choice and he knew that man by giving him the choice would fall so being that he had to do that he turned back around and makes the man a partner to him and does nothing except he does it to amen amen amen so God wants to work now he still wants to do his work but he wants us he can do nothing except he does it to a man and now always doing it through a many-membled body you have to see God in the now amen you can't look at him two thousand years in the manger yeah you have to look at him how he's been working all these years how is use man is your seven Church eight Messengers you call the people out amen and to the last message the message of last day we've been called out yes amen and God is alive working amongst us amen amen amen the savior of mankind he's working through man the Creator himself working in his creation amen amen hallelujah and he's working through us and he's got us to be partner with him now amen amen the things that he wants done he uses us to get it done amen amen if he wants somebody to be saved you've got to go and preach the gospel amen you've got to go and present the gospel to them he's going to use you how are they going to be saved except someone goes except how can people be safe except someone be sent forth and how can and when they go for what they have to do preach the gospel the whole work of Redemption come by man Hallelujah get come by the first man life come by the second Adam there you are he does nothing because he had to use a man for that then he uses a man to redeem back again so deity Jehovah is deity and become a child yes I don't know how much more clear we need to bring it to the people Jehovah become a child he become in the form of sin that he might redeem The Sinner there's the whole thing but we find that in every age God's gift is always rejected but it find this place amen his gift will always be rejected if it happened in the days of Jesus it had to happen in the days of the prophet if it happened in the days of the Prophet it has to happen now because if you are they are carrying out Christ's mandate then you will not be popular in the Earth you will lose your popularity if you are popular amongst the people of the world and there's something wrong with you because you have basically you have to be the oddball because everything about us he's from another world Amen remember Jesus said father as it is in heaven so let it be on earth now our thinking is not thinking of this nature our thinking is from a different place amen we are now seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in other words our thinking is different from Men our thinking is different from the scientific man we have a faith civilization when they are in doubt when they are negative about the things you are talking about faith when they are in depressed and they don't know what to do you are rejoicing you think praise the Lord God Will Make A Way when they don't know what to do about the situation you have an answer yes because you're thinking your nature is different amen your makeup is different amen that is why if you got the Holy Ghost you cannot go to a place and remain in sin your your own digest it your makeup wouldn't digest that place but you find that God gift has always been projected he was rejected from the days of Jesus they couldn't accept it nicotibles came to Jesus and said surely Rabbi the thou art a man sent from God be with you because no man can do this thing except God be with him so he recognize it firstly Miracles the devil can't do it you recognize Jesus is doing all his medical God has to be with him so you recognize God is with him then why are you even debating why are you even reasoning you're saying that William Branham did all his miracles I mean God did all his miracles to William Branham that he was a prophet sent from God so you saw that God is with him then what is your issue I'm not believing what he's saying because if God is not good if God is not going to do all this miracles he said to your Nicodemus say unto you no matter what surely surely I say unto you except you'll be born again you cannot inherit the king you cannot see the kingdom of God he's saying old man like me how can I go back to my mother alone so you think he currently already now so when you thought when you talk about the Rapture now a body chain the other thing about Canada how are you gonna have a body change in your whole body How Are You Gonna Change that's right how are you going to have a body change you see they don't really understand God's Plan of Redemption but he said to Nicodemus you must be born again there's no Shortcuts To Heaven unfortunately your good gifts your good works is not going to take you to heaven unfortunately coming to a messy Church that believe this message is not going to take you to heaven you're going to have to be born again you're gonna have to have the nature change there must be a change within you because the same creator died for his creation amen the creator of life formed his own creation to come live with his creation and die for his creation amen now he did all that but for you not to go back to live with your creator you got to now accept what you've done for you yes because it didn't just come to be born in the manger he come to die why did he die because in life his life the animal sacrifice was temporary but now the blood the chemistry died up but his life the life of his blood must be in you his life must come in you which is his old Spirit he the Holy Ghost to come and live in you to guide you to navigate you amen amen now people want now he said these wise men bringing the gift identify the gifts identified what it was that's the reason God protect those gifts through every move they made he protected it until they arrived in those gifts see nothing could take away those gifts from him they couldn't have been wrong for it because God would have preserve them the angels of God came down and preserved him he protected it until they arrived with his gifts because they were footing for the time Do you have a if you are called of God to present this message nothing will stop you from presenting this message amen God will preserve it until it's presented yes amen he will preserve those gifts people might have stifled you people are going to stand for your ministry people may have stifle you from talking you might have tried to shut you up for many years but there come a time God would make sure the dead voice will speak out amen God will make sure that that body is used amen that mouth those vocals are used nothing can nothing can stifle that because why God checks his gifts amen he said he protected it until they arrived will give because they were fitting for the time that's what's going on now hope it ain't over your head I have to speak it incredible you sing he says but you see it's the thing that happening is fitting for this day let us here it's the footing time the Reason God has protected it see brought it right through to identify himself gift though it caused the death put a stumbling block in their way it's a footing time that's right footing for the day that's the reason God has protected it the way he will protect it until his purpose is served amen amen so in all things God purpose must be served amen so you find today that people might have this celebration they might have only Santa Claus we know the history of Death From First Single giving gifts and all that and now they made it a thing now they made it a like Santa Claus in some kind of a fairy tale thing which is not even true life with the children and we know that we know all the Pagan celebrations included are nothing about Christ for we thank God that we could receive Christ amen like Mary we said be not to me according to Thy Word but there has to come a time when there's a press upon the people they had to become there's a coming of squeezing time a time where economic crisis as you can see the taxes are increasing taxation is increasing a time of economic crisis and in that time and it's coming in about a time where Christ must be manifested amen amen you receive Christ but there must be a manifestation it's good enough that you will conceive Christ when you receive the word you conceive of the Holy One when you receive the word but there must be a manifestation yes there must be a Church of God with the move of God upon the Earth Greater Works indeed shall you do amen there must be a book of Acts again yes upon the Earth and when it is happening in the time of pressure in a time of squeezing just before the manifestation amen of Christ again they must be that manifest in time yes it's not it's going to be implemented it's good to be glowing but there has to be the manifestation amen must be the manifestation of the word and God has preserved that gift all these years amen they've been scoffers coughing out of the other gift has been preserved but the hour is coming when the third pull will be in effect yes amen amen you believe that yes amen see what he says may the great Christmas present the first one and the only one and the original one day is Jesus Christ be afreshing your hearts today today May the Holy Spirit come to you and bring you ministering gifts and things from God you see if if you are so much in love with God and if you are stimulated by his word you pray for more of God Amen say Lord I want more of your gift send for those ministering gifts yes speak to me Lord and things from God a gift that you might have live a better life amen that's what I want I would rather have the Life of Christ in me to live sweet and Victorious then I would all the gifts of healing the gifts of prophecies and all the other gifts Just Give Me Jesus amen you see that's the concubines they want to accept the gifts of the Holy Ghost but they don't want the Holy Ghost himself they don't want the gift of the Holy Ghost which is The Giver of the Holy Ghost amen Just Give Me Jesus let me live the life the life is what I want to look I want to live so others will know that's my desire at Christmas and I pray that's your desire and I pray that Lord God will give us his desire amen thank you he says the whole creation was lost we just went to it in the Seven Seals the whole creation was lost everything was gone it all belonged to Satan we felt heir to it he still owns it he certainly does that's the reason we're fighting and having all this trouble he controls every Kingdom Satan does every government every King every Kingdom controlled by Satan the old world is controlled and run by Satan that's the reason we have the troubles that we have any Bible student or anything can tell you that Satan well the Bible itself says he did see then he controls the world that's why he could offered it to Jesus but Christ will fall heir to it for now he is Our Redeemer he come to redeem the whole creation and nothing could do it but God himself amen amen amen and we find in this day when the title did comes down amen then it's known that Christ has done the work amen there is just too many that Christ have done the work of redemption because from the grave amen he goes down to Hell and takes the keys of detail in the grave amen and now comes again to claim those that He redeemed what the open book amen thank God for the open book that we could see all of his word amen amen was closed up yes part of redemption was shown in all ages but in this day redemption is fully Merit fully made known to us hallelujah amen aren't you glad that Redemption is fully known amen and you can now sing Amazing Grace oh sweet that sound now once was lost but now I'm found not thinking maybe I'll be saved if I do this Lord maybe I'll be safe I do that oh Lord am I going to go in the Rapture am I not going to go in the Rapture yet you believe in the message you believe in the sea then you ask yourself Lord you're still debating with yourself whether you bring in the rapture when God has revealing to you amen if you can see your name in there then you are going in the Rapture amen yes amen if something when he knew he's giving you an erupturing faith and you're making your you're making yourself ready what are you doing that for amen you wouldn't be reasoning within yourself am I going in the Rapture am I saved am I going to hell no that was for Pentecostal babe amen word was revealed to you have you seen your name there amen that word was made known to you you've seen your name in The Plan of Redemption you've seen your name sealed up don't you know you are sealed up until the day of your Redemption amen that's why I say grief not the spirit of God whereby our seal until the day of your Redemption amen without reasoning whether we are saved we are saved yes amen we are part of him amen are we not received when it comes to you Lord may know to you that you are part of him that God is your father amen if God is your father then where else can you go can you go to a temporary place no if you've got eternal life it means you even if you if you think you're gonna go to hell you're gonna happen about because if you eternal life how can you go to hell it's a temporary place amen salvation Redemption is made known to you not for everybody yes but Redemption is made known to you amen amen so we thank God for that he says he may the great Christmas present the first one the only one the only an original and the only one there is which is Jesus Christ be afresh in your heart amen he says may the Holy Spirit come to you and bring you ministering gifts and things from God a gift that you might be live a better life that's what I want I would rather have the Life of Christ in me to live sweet and Victorious than with all the gifts of healing the gifts of Prophecy all the other gifts Just Give Me Jesus Amen Let me live the life the life is what I want to know I want to live so others will know see Jesus come so we need to live our life for the service to God Amen the goal is typing deity we are part of him women we are part of these days amen amen the mother
