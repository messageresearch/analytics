[0:00] Um
[0:02] I wonder if you can turn Amen to chapter
[0:06] 26 2 Chronicles.
[0:16] You know I say this on the onset of the
[0:19] service.
[0:22] Uh many of us sometimes
[0:26] don't understand the difference between
[0:29] a preacher
[0:32] uh a minister a minister and and a
[0:35] preacher very close you know in the
[0:37] calling
[0:39] and a pastor.
[0:44] The difference about a pastor beside
[0:46] taking care of the flock,
[0:49] you'll find that
[0:51] a preacher will be able to preach a
[0:54] message today here
[0:56] and tomorrow he can preach a message in
[0:59] another church.
[1:01] But the poor pastor every week has to
[1:04] feed his flock with something new. When
[1:06] I say new, I mean the word of God,
[1:09] &gt;&gt; but something different from last week
[1:12] &gt;&gt; or from the week previous.
[1:15] &gt;&gt; So that's a big difference.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; So the burden lies a lot on a pastor
[1:22] &gt;&gt; and the support can get from his
[1:24] congregation is very very important.
[1:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; So do understand that there's a
[1:31] difference. For me it's easier because I
[1:34] preached this message uh other places.
[1:37] So this morning you hearing it the first
[1:40] time and be privileged this morning to
[1:43] feed upon God's word.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; I want to bring greetings um from u
[1:49] raine Christian assembly and also
[1:53] brother Nami
[1:54] told me I must greet the church this
[1:57] morning. supposed to uh minister. I were
[2:00] not sure uh what was happening but they
[2:04] wanted me to minister but I mentioned to
[2:08] brother Nami that it's been some times
[2:11] that I ever been here in Phoenix
[2:14] &gt;&gt; and I know the last time you know I was
[2:17] here and and I ministered it's very long
[2:21] and this morning I I take this you know
[2:24] as a privilege to be here together you
[2:27] know in this assembly and to minister
[2:30] God's word.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; So then shall we turn to chapter 26
[2:35] of 2 Chronicles? Amen.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Excuse me with some of the names that
[2:41] are so difficult to pronounce, but you
[2:45] would read it. Amen.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48] It says, "Then all the people of Judah
[2:51] took us
[2:55] &gt;&gt; who was 16 years old and made him king
[2:59] in the room of his father Amaziah.
[3:05] After the father died, the son took
[3:09] uh the leadership
[3:13] being the king,
[3:15] &gt;&gt; the highest leadership, you know, in a
[3:18] uh he is to be a king.
[3:22] And we go to verse four just because of
[3:26] time it's quite a lengthy subject
[3:29] uh to see the life of Isaiah. So I'll be
[3:32] skipping in between verse four.
[3:36] And he did that which was right in the
[3:39] sight of the Lord according to all that
[3:42] his father Amaziah did.
[3:49] And he sought God in the days of
[3:51] Zechariah
[3:53] who had understanding in the visions of
[3:56] God. And as long as he sought the Lord,
[4:00] God made him to prosper. You may take
[4:04] your seats. I'm going to read continue
[4:05] reading.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Uh but you can take your seats this
[4:08] morning. Amen.
[4:14] You see this morning, I want to say it
[4:16] this way that it is your life.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; That proves
[4:23] what you are.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:28] The prophet of God says then the queen
[4:30] of Sheba, it is your life that proves
[4:32] what you are.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; Are your brides material
[4:38] &gt;&gt; or what are you? Amen this morning.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; So let us look at ourselves this morning
[4:44] not at the next person so much and let
[4:48] us you know let God have his own way.
[4:52] We were talking about grace and the
[4:55] brother sang the song.
[4:57] I really took it to to heart of the
[5:00] words from the song
[5:03] &gt;&gt; and he spoke about grace there also.
[5:07] It took the grace of God.
[5:12] It took the grace of God.
[5:16] Jesus Christ died and that made the
[5:19] difference.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. We were talking about
[5:23] you know having the grace of God is so
[5:26] important in our life.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; Now what is the grace of God?
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; Do we think about it? What is the grace
[5:34] of God?
[5:36] &gt;&gt; If there was no Calvary there wouldn't
[5:38] be the grace of God.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; He took Calvary
[5:43] and in Calvary there was a death that
[5:45] took place.
[5:49] And this morning there must be a death
[5:52] that must take place in ourselves.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; We just want to speak a little on
[6:01] eternal life this morning.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; Eternal life is not this life that you
[6:07] and I are living.
[6:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:09] &gt;&gt; If I ask you, you know, I mean, why are
[6:11] you living?
[6:13] The true answer is I'm living for a
[6:16] better life. Amen.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; There's no other reason.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; You are here this morning
[6:23] &gt;&gt; preparing for a better life.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; Not the life when you lose a loved one
[6:33] and then you get down depressed and
[6:36] &gt;&gt; you are lost.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; It is the feelings of this body that
[6:42] manifest itself.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; And you feel so bad. But we talking
[6:47] about another life.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; A life that's going to be eternal.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; And nothing can replace that life.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; So that is why you are here this morning
[7:02] is to make ready for that life.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; We are preparing for that life.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[7:10] It is a new birth
[7:13] and a change of art that changes a man
[7:17] from a dying being
[7:20] &gt;&gt; to a resurrected immortal son of God,
[7:24] &gt;&gt; taking his place on the seat of the
[7:28] believer's heart.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; It's a nature change.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; But this nature change is from this life
[7:35] to eternal life. Yes.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; So a year for a time period.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; And one of these days that time period
[7:42] will expire
[7:43] &gt;&gt; and you're gone.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; So how much are we doing to make ready
[7:50] for that life?
[7:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; When we look at the cross of Calvary,
[7:56] we see something amazing that happened.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; It took the innocent
[8:02] to become you and me.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh yes. Now I'm not preaching
[8:06] salvation this morning
[8:08] &gt;&gt; but I'm preaching true salvation.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; Salvation the way we have to look at it
[8:16] &gt;&gt; as message believers.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; Change of life.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; You know I always think about these
[8:24] great men that were being in this world.
[8:27] Really they were great men. You think of
[8:31] Mandela, you think of Mahatma Gandhi.
[8:35] They were great men.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; They were great. They were powerful men.
[8:42] And we must appreciate for the changes
[8:44] that they made.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; We must be thankful in this mortal
[8:49] flesh. They made life a little much
[8:53] better than what it was before that.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; So in those things we give thanks.
[9:03] But I want to tell you this morning,
[9:04] church,
[9:06] the greatest thing happened when Christ
[9:10] died on Calvary.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:14] &gt;&gt; When he died, he paid a price.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; And that was a worthy price for you and
[9:21] me.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; And he was an innocent one.
[9:26] &gt;&gt; That's the sad part. He was innocent,
[9:30] &gt;&gt; but he paid the price for us.
[9:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; You see, that's my eternal life.
[9:39] If I don't feed this natural man, it
[9:44] will die.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:46] And if I don't feed the spiritual man,
[9:50] &gt;&gt; it will die.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; So, let us
[9:55] &gt;&gt; look into it. Yes.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; And realize this natural man you will
[10:00] die
[10:01] &gt;&gt; if you don't feed it. That's why you eat
[10:03] food
[10:05] &gt;&gt; so that the body can grow strong.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; But that's only going to be temporary.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; Just for a while.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; But the spiritual man is eternal.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; That's what we are preparing for.
[10:20] So this morning,
[10:24] the gift of life is eternal life. Amen.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Rather, the gift of God is eternal
[10:34] &gt;&gt; life.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; And I want you to ponder and remember
[10:39] that that's an important thing about
[10:43] we as believers.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. God sent us a prophet. I just want
[10:49] to read a quotation.
[10:52] I haven't started yet with the message,
[10:55] but something that I want to
[11:00] read what he says here.
[11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; From seven churches.
[11:07] He says persecution
[11:11] and trials are a natural
[11:15] normal part of the Christian life. I'm
[11:18] not saying it.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; My prophet and your prophet is saying
[11:22] that
[11:23] &gt;&gt; it's part of the Christian life.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; And there is only one thing you can do
[11:31] about them.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:34] Does anybody know what you think that
[11:36] you can do about it?
[11:37] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; Commit them all to God.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[11:44] &gt;&gt; judge not and leave the outworking and
[11:48] final judgment to him.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; So many a time we struggle around
[11:54] certain things instead of leaving it to
[11:57] God to help us in prayer.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, help us. He says how tragic page 108
[12:04] church ages how tragic it is that this
[12:08] first age did not listen to the spirit.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; Instead it listen to man.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; But thank God
[12:19] in the last age there will be a group.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; That will rise up.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The true brides.
[12:29] Yes.
[12:31] of the last day
[12:33] &gt;&gt; and she will listen to the spirit.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; There'll be a connection.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; She will listen to the spirit.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; In the day of gross darkness,
[12:44] &gt;&gt; the light will return by the pure word.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; And we will return to the power of
[12:52] Pentecost.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Not we going to go back to Pentecost as
[12:56] such, but the power of Pentecost.
[13:00] of them.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Thank you.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Now we are thankful for the messenger.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; You see at the moment when you look
[13:12] around us
[13:15] the denominational world
[13:19] is having a revival with Pentecost.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; That's a level they are in.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[13:28] It is just like Abraham
[13:33] when he had Ishmael, he was excited.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; He was happy with Ishmaile and even told
[13:40] God,
[13:41] he said, you know, he was thankful for
[13:43] Ishmael. He says just leave him, you
[13:45] know, like he just was thankful. He was
[13:49] very thankful because he had his son
[13:52] Isma. Yes.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; But God said
[13:56] about the promised seed,
[13:58] &gt;&gt; the promised son,
[14:01] &gt;&gt; was going to be Isaac.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; So sometimes we get excited over these
[14:09] small things and we think that is
[14:11] heaven.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Let us be careful. Yes.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Where we draw our line. And that is why
[14:19] we are further up in this message
[14:22] because we realize we need more than
[14:25] &gt;&gt; Pentecost.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; When we look at the three pools,
[14:30] &gt;&gt; when we look at the three pools, what do
[14:32] you see there?
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; The revealing of his word in the last
[14:38] book
[14:39] &gt;&gt; is more edifying.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; And it is what can give us rapturing
[14:44] grace.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So church this morning
[14:49] I'm trying to keep it simple
[14:53] saying it simple so that everyone can
[14:56] understand.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; When you come from the old school
[14:59] sometime it's odd but we are thankful to
[15:01] God we learned a lot.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; When you talk about the old school you
[15:08] can't wear a fancy suit.
[15:12] You can't wear a dark color shirt or
[15:14] bright color shirt.
[15:17] We were so conscious about everything.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Let me say this just for the sake of
[15:24] many new believers that have come over
[15:26] the years.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; It was such
[15:30] that you cannot even get married.
[15:35] I remembered in the congregation in
[15:39] Tongat in those days the days when we
[15:43] just came into the message.
[15:46] Nobody wants to get married because the
[15:48] Lord is coming
[15:50] &gt;&gt; and I believe the Lord is coming.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; I sincerely believe from the bottom of
[15:55] my heart and and that is why we make
[15:57] ready every day in our life.
[16:03] I was asked by my brother in in the
[16:06] flesh who was also in the message at
[16:08] that time.
[16:10] He's late now
[16:12] that I must go to this certain brother
[16:15] now who was seated like the bishop
[16:18] and get permission from him if you're
[16:20] going to get married.
[16:24] Now in in in in in in
[16:27] normal slang terms
[16:31] I was they say I was a lightye
[16:34] &gt;&gt; that means you was a
[16:36] &gt;&gt; a young boy. I was 21 years old just
[16:39] over 2021
[16:41] and you have to go through this brother
[16:43] now
[16:47] and you have to say to him look I'm
[16:51] intending to get married
[16:54] because they believe the Lord is coming
[16:57] &gt;&gt; and it was very firm very tough
[17:01] everybody was sincere and god-fearing
[17:07] already I've been reading these books,
[17:09] the spoken word books by then
[17:12] &gt;&gt; and here was
[17:15] the brother that I have to go and see. I
[17:17] went to his house, my mom's house
[17:20] and then I met up with him and then I
[17:22] told him this is my situation.
[17:27] I believe the Bible says better to marry
[17:29] than to betterness. Gave him one two
[17:32] scriptures that I understood
[17:34] and said to him, I want to go in the
[17:37] rapture. I want to be a true Christian.
[17:40] So, I want to
[17:43] get married.
[17:47] He said to me, I'm going to say it the
[17:49] way he he mentioned to me. He said, your
[17:52] light is what's wrong with you?
[17:54] [Music]
[17:55] what's wrong with you? I said, why? What
[17:58] is wrong with what I'm saying?
[18:01] He said, no, there's no more time for
[18:03] that. Just go tell her you joke to them.
[18:10] Get over
[18:13] now. You hearing this from the horse's
[18:15] mouth?
[18:17] &gt;&gt; I mean, I experienc this,
[18:22] &gt;&gt; but I was a bit of a difficult guy. I
[18:25] think it was difficult in those days
[18:28] till we met short and we learned a lot
[18:30] of I said no brother said what he was
[18:34] going to do for example you're going to
[18:36] plant potatoes
[18:37] &gt;&gt; tomorrow you don't plant potatoes
[18:39] tomorrow
[18:40] &gt;&gt; I said that was my plan
[18:42] &gt;&gt; and I want to get married
[18:44] &gt;&gt; amen
[18:45] &gt;&gt; so that I can know I got my family
[18:50] few years later when I say few could be
[18:54] almost 3 years later, the same brother
[18:57] got married.
[18:59] So you see, you have to be careful
[19:03] rightly dividing the word of God.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Don't just take what the pastor says
[19:10] everything down your throat.
[19:13] Hear to it. Look into it. And you not
[19:17] sure of something, sit and say, "Pastor,
[19:20] I don't see these things or elder, I
[19:22] don't see this thing. explain to me
[19:25] &gt;&gt; and I'm sure there'll be an explanation.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; So that is how life started for us in
[19:31] this message.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Y are the most privileged people in
[19:34] these days that y'all got everything on
[19:37] the plates.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; We got we had those real tapes. How many
[19:42] of youall remember the real tapes? You
[19:44] older folks, you remember the real
[19:46] tapes?
[19:48] The remembers the you remember the real
[19:51] tapes uh when his father used to have
[19:54] those tapes also. It was real tapes and
[19:58] that was the start of the service to end
[20:01] of the service was over 3 hours. You
[20:04] have to hear through the message
[20:06] &gt;&gt; and then it came into cess
[20:10] &gt;&gt; and then now on onto
[20:12] your your cities and even you see
[20:16] technology advanced itself that now we
[20:19] got it so simple question and answers
[20:22] and everything you find that God has
[20:25] revealed this to us. Amen. In this made
[20:28] it so much easier. You know why it
[20:30] became so much easier?
[20:33] We are living in the tradition churches.
[20:37] It's naked, miserable, but everything is
[20:41] getting smarter.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; You know, everything is around the
[20:46] computer.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[20:47] &gt;&gt; I'm happy my knowledge is so limited on
[20:49] these things
[20:51] &gt;&gt; that, you know, I have to search and
[20:52] find in the word of God. and and and
[20:55] this morning church, you know, ser
[20:59] serving serving the Lord in this in this
[21:02] time is wonderful.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; It's it's really uh it blips your heart.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; As much as we know what we stand for, as
[21:16] much as we know what the world tells us,
[21:19] but we know it's the truth.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. And when you know it's the truth,
[21:23] &gt;&gt; your arts get strengthened, edifice, get
[21:26] stronger,
[21:27] &gt;&gt; that you want to persevere and continue
[21:30] &gt;&gt; the unveiling of God.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; I like many of the prayers of the
[21:36] prophet
[21:38] &gt;&gt; especially you know when he starts
[21:39] prayer he says certain things that
[21:42] touches your heart.
[21:45] He says here, "Our gracious Lord,
[21:48] we are indeed grateful today for this
[21:51] privilege that we have of assembling
[21:54] ourselves together upon the earth before
[21:57] the coming of the Lord.
[22:00] May we examine our hearts today
[22:07] &gt;&gt; by the word
[22:10] &gt;&gt; and see if we are in the faith
[22:13] that we might be ready
[22:17] that the hour of his appearing that we
[22:20] should be as the scripture has said
[22:23] would be caught up
[22:26] &gt;&gt; together with those who are asleep and
[22:30] meet the Lord in the air forever.
[22:33] Be with him.
[22:36] And in verse seven, he says, "And now we
[22:40] trust that the Lord will bless each one
[22:42] of you.
[22:44] I know your hearts are full of joy,
[22:47] looking for the coming of the Lord."
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Are you looking for the coming of the
[22:51] Lord?
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Are you just coming to church because
[22:55] daddy and mommy is here? or you really
[22:58] know and you've got the revelation now
[23:01] &gt;&gt; and you know about this coming of the
[23:04] Lord we are talking about.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:08] He says the coming of the Lord and mine
[23:09] also bubbling over
[23:12] to see things happening the way they
[23:15] are.
[23:17] national safe and the church
[23:21] in the condition it is
[23:25] sap states
[23:27] &gt;&gt; and see the signs of his coming both
[23:30] physically
[23:33] we spoke about life
[23:35] &gt;&gt; true life
[23:36] &gt;&gt; yes
[23:37] &gt;&gt; so here the prophet says physically and
[23:40] spiritually
[23:42] &gt;&gt; and knowing that the time of his
[23:45] appearing is so
[23:50] It just fills our heart with joy to know
[23:52] that we are going to be changed one of
[23:55] these days.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; We are going
[23:58] &gt;&gt; to be changed
[24:00] &gt;&gt; from these creatures that we are.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I believe with sincerity in
[24:05] my heart
[24:07] that we are living in that latter time.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; In the time of the coming of the Lord
[24:13] Jesus Christ.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:15] And therefore this uh this morning
[24:19] we have to raise our faith
[24:22] &gt;&gt; higher.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Just one more
[24:28] uh encouragement to give you and then we
[24:30] go into the word of God. I must watch my
[24:34] time.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; I want to lift up your your spirits this
[24:43] morning. Amen.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you. That's the job
[24:46] of a preacher is to bring forth the word
[24:48] and encourage the church.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; In a small congregation in the foothills
[24:56] of Great Smokies
[24:58] built a new sanctuary on a piece of land
[25:02] willed to them by a church member.
[25:06] And 10 days before the new church was to
[25:09] open,
[25:11] the local building inspector informed
[25:13] the pastor that the parking lot was
[25:16] inadequate
[25:19] for the size of the building.
[25:22] They needed more parking space.
[25:28] And until the church had to double the
[25:30] size of the parking lot,
[25:34] it would mean that the church would not
[25:36] open its doors.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; It cannot use the sanctuary.
[25:41] Unfortunately, the church with its
[25:43] undersized lot had used every inch of
[25:47] the land except to the mountain against
[25:50] which it had been built. So whatever
[25:53] land was there, it was used to the
[25:55] fullest except the one in the back where
[25:59] it there was a mountain
[26:02] &gt;&gt; and you know there's not much you can do
[26:05] about it. It was a huge mountain.
[26:11] The pastor announced the next Sunday
[26:13] morning that he would meet that evening
[26:17] with members who had mountain moving
[26:20] faith. Amen.
[26:23] [Music]
[26:26] &gt;&gt; The real thing.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; And they would hold a prayer session
[26:30] asking God to remove the mountain from
[26:34] the backyard
[26:35] &gt;&gt; and to somehow provide enough money
[26:38] because you when you remove the
[26:39] mountain, you have to do the floors.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:46] to have provide enough money to have it
[26:48] paved and painted before the scheduled
[26:51] opening dedication service the following
[26:54] week.
[26:58] At the appointed time 24 here you see
[27:02] the colors now 24 of the congregations
[27:05] 300 members 24 300 members assembled for
[27:09] prayer. Sure.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; So they certainly marked their mountain
[27:13] moving
[27:16] &gt;&gt; trust. Amen. They prayed for nearly 3
[27:19] hours
[27:21] and at 10:00 the pastor said the final
[27:25] amen.
[27:29] And he said we will open next Sunday as
[27:32] scheduled.
[27:34] He assured everyone God has never let us
[27:37] down before.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:41] And I believe you will be faithful this
[27:44] time too.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; And the next morning
[27:51] as the pastor was working in his study
[27:54] there came a loud knock at the door.
[27:59] And when he called come in,
[28:02] a rough looking construction foreman
[28:04] appeared removing his hard hat as he
[28:08] entered.
[28:10] and he said, "Excuse me, reverence.
[28:13] I'm from this particular construction
[28:16] company over in the next county.
[28:20] We are building a huge shopping mall."
[28:24] And we need some filler means gravel.
[28:32] We will remove and pave all the exposed
[28:35] area free of charge
[28:37] &gt;&gt; if we can have it right now.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; We can do nothing with our m to extend
[28:45] or whatever it is until we get that dirt
[28:48] that gravel
[28:50] &gt;&gt; in and allow it to settle.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; I always think the price has been paid
[28:59] on Calvary. always think about this.
[29:02] Lord,
[29:03] &gt;&gt; the little church was dedicated the next
[29:05] Sunday as originally plans.
[29:09] I like that the pastor stood there with
[29:12] his words. Amen. That is the service.
[29:15] going to continue with everything up to
[29:18] date.
[29:19] And there were far more members with
[29:23] mountain moving faith
[29:27] &gt;&gt; on the opening Sunday than there than
[29:29] there had been the previous week.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Praise wonderful.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; I wonder what would you have do in this
[29:40] case?
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. Would you also have had that faith
[29:45] that can move amen mountains?
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; And this morning we are grateful to
[29:52] understand that. Amen. Hallelujah. As we
[29:56] read the word this morning, the
[29:58] scripture,
[30:01] we look at
[30:03] this great king
[30:07] Uzziah.
[30:10] a great king. Very great. Amen. He was.
[30:13] As we look at some scriptures just now
[30:17] and you'll see how powerful this man was
[30:23] to the extent they could hear
[30:28] and know about his power even in Egypt.
[30:36] And when we look at his background,
[30:40] he came from a family
[30:43] where his parents raised him in the ways
[30:45] of the Lord.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; In chapter 20
[30:53] 25,
[30:56] if you can just turn backwards to
[30:57] chapter 25, that was his fatherhiah.
[31:02] He was 20
[31:04] and 5 years old when he began to reign
[31:07] and he reigned 20 and 9 years in
[31:10] Jerusalem. The Lord the father
[31:13] in verse two said and he did that which
[31:16] was right in the sight of the Lord.
[31:20] Now
[31:22] even the prophet speaks about that. He
[31:24] says his upbringing he had a lot of
[31:26] influence you know in the way he
[31:28] conducted himself
[31:30] though it says in in verse two he says
[31:34] but not with a perfect heart.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; So we don't know what went wrong in
[31:40] there what he was thinking but in
[31:44] general he raised the family in the ways
[31:47] of God. He raised his children in the
[31:49] ways of God.
[31:52] And then in 26
[31:55] he talks about
[31:57] Uzziah was 16 years old when he became
[32:00] the king. At that age the people wanted
[32:05] him as a king
[32:09] and they made him a king in the room of
[32:11] his father when his father died.
[32:15] We look at the latter part of the father
[32:17] also. He went and brought the the gods
[32:21] of the world into his house, idols and
[32:24] all those things and that upset God and
[32:28] later
[32:29] the people murdered him, killed him.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; That's how important it is to walk in
[32:36] the ways of the Lord.
[32:40] In verse 4, 264,
[32:44] it says that he did
[32:46] that which was right in the sight of the
[32:48] Lord according to all that his father
[32:52] and Messiah did.
[32:56] We don't want to go too much into it,
[32:57] but it's very important how we raise our
[33:01] family. Yes.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; It's very, very important how we raise
[33:05] our family.
[33:07] that will show forth what fruit
[33:11] it will bear.
[33:14] In verse five, it says, "And he sought
[33:16] God in the days of Zechariah."
[33:22] He says, "And as long as he sought the
[33:24] Lord,
[33:27] God made him to prosper."
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Now, the devil sometimes can tempt
[33:33] people and make them to prosper, too.
[33:37] when the head get a bit big, you know,
[33:39] they they get into the world side of
[33:42] things.
[33:44] So I'm not talking about that pro. I'm
[33:46] talking about prosper in the Lord.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; He says the Lord made him to prosper.
[33:56] here is a is is this king
[34:00] that has received the blessings of God
[34:03] and God add him and cut it and lifted
[34:06] him.
[34:09] And I want to title my message
[34:12] this morning.
[34:17] Stay in your office.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; What God has called you, you stay in
[34:23] your office.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And watch out. Beware of pride.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; May I say it even a little different?
[34:31] Beware of pride in high places.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; You know when you get up there
[34:38] &gt;&gt; high places
[34:40] then you feel you got wings now. You are
[34:43] somebody.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Our attitude changes.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; We didn't want to tell the pastor how to
[34:49] run the church.
[34:51] We don't tell the elder you know uh what
[34:55] to do.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; We'll tell the deacons no you know they
[34:59] are not right.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; We want to start finding faults on one
[35:03] another.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; No
[35:06] &gt;&gt; that is what we must watch.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; So here was this young king
[35:15] 16 years old. The Bible says he reigned
[35:19] for over 50 years. 52 years I would Yes.
[35:23] Over 50 years
[35:26] from a young man.
[35:29] And for 50 years plus
[35:32] he reigned as king.
[35:36] Verse six. And he went forth and warded
[35:39] against the Philistines and break down
[35:42] the wall of Gap and the wall of Gavna
[35:46] and the wall of Ashdod and build cities.
[35:51] He was very, you know, much on the
[35:54] building and uh weapons. vers. And God
[36:00] helped him.
[36:03] And God helped him
[36:05] against the Philistines and against the
[36:08] Arabians that dwelt
[36:11] in those places.
[36:14] Verse
[36:16] eight.
[36:18] And the Amorites gave gifts to Uzziah,
[36:22] and his name spread abroad, even to the
[36:26] entering in of Egypt, for he
[36:29] strengthened himself exceedingly.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to pay attention about
[36:36] when it says, "And he ex and he
[36:38] strengthened himself exceedingly."
[36:42] It's only God's favor in your life that
[36:45] carries you every day.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; It's not about yourself who you are.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; It's about God's favor.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; And that is why we must stay
[37:01] in the way of God, not on the way of
[37:03] man.
[37:06] He says they built towers in Jerusalem.
[37:11] You go on to verse 10. Also he built
[37:13] towers in the desert places and they dig
[37:16] for wells. He say the low
[37:20] country and in the plains husband men
[37:23] also and uh vine dresses to the
[37:27] mountains and in camel for he loved
[37:31] husband. So here we see he loved that
[37:34] outdoor life.
[37:37] Nothing wrong about that.
[37:39] Moreover, Uzziah had an host of fighting
[37:42] men.
[37:45] You see so much about him that we are
[37:49] reading now. He says that he went out to
[37:53] war by bands amount of people, military
[37:56] force
[37:58] according to the number of the accounts
[37:59] by the hand of J, the scribe. And then
[38:04] he say verse 12, "And the whole number
[38:06] of the of the chief of the fathers, the
[38:09] mighty men of Allah were 2,600.
[38:16] And under their hand was an army
[38:21] 300,000
[38:22] and 7,000 and 500."
[38:27] You see the numbers. Amen.
[38:29] And verse 14. And Uzziah prepared for
[38:33] them throughout all the old shields and
[38:37] spears and helmets and others and bows
[38:42] and slings and stones to pass stones and
[38:45] not the slings that you and I think of.
[38:48] Slings that could pass big stones
[38:51] can kill people. So he was so well
[38:55] organized
[38:58] with
[39:00] you know the help of God
[39:03] that everything fell so well in his lot.
[39:08] But then his head became a bit swelled
[39:12] more
[39:14] and he made in Jerusalem angels. Verse
[39:18] 15. And invented by cunning men to be on
[39:22] the towers and upon the bullwarks to
[39:25] shoot arrows and great stone dog. And
[39:29] his name spread far abroad.
[39:33] For he was marvelously helped till he
[39:37] was strong.
[39:40] The word strong is not just
[39:43] he was strong, he was famous, he was
[39:47] known for all these things
[39:52] because he had the help of God.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; And many a times with the help of God we
[39:58] have seen great things happen in our
[40:00] lives
[40:03] because God being with us.
[40:07] Verse 16
[40:12] comes to our climax of the of of the
[40:15] main part of the scriptures or the
[40:17] message says but when he was strong
[40:22] his heart was lifted up to his
[40:24] destruction to his destruction.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; When he was strong
[40:30] &gt;&gt; when he thought he knew it all.
[40:33] Many a time when we think we know it
[40:35] all,
[40:38] we think there's nobody else can think
[40:41] like me. Nobody else is better than me.
[40:44] Many times it has come across us. Many
[40:47] of times we have thought that.
[40:51] Maybe you have prospered. Maybe you've
[40:53] been doing well.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've been the leader in your
[40:56] family doing so well
[40:59] and you took it to heart.
[41:05] or in the congregation. Many a times you
[41:07] will think these things.
[41:10] But when he was strong, his heart was
[41:12] lifted up to his destruction.
[41:15] For he transgressed against the Lord the
[41:19] God is God.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; When you touch on God's side,
[41:25] &gt;&gt; you have to be so careful.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:29] You are playing with fire
[41:32] &gt;&gt; and fire burns.
[41:35] You play with water, you will drown.
[41:37] That's what happened in the time of
[41:38] Noah.
[41:42] And when he was strong, his heart was
[41:44] lifted up to his destruction, to his own
[41:47] destruction.
[41:48] For he transgressed against the Lord his
[41:51] God, and went into the temple of the
[41:54] Lord to burn incense upon the altar of
[41:58] incense.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Such a sad part to to read the
[42:03] scriptures.
[42:07] He looked at himself and he was big in
[42:09] his boots.
[42:13] Many a times these are the things that
[42:16] take us away from God.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; These are the things pride and we are
[42:22] somebody
[42:24] and it draws us away from the presence
[42:26] of God.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; When we know and we look at example that
[42:32] God has left for us through the
[42:33] prophetic ministry. We look at the
[42:35] prophet of God was such a humble man of
[42:39] God.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; And we learned so much from that. Yes,
[42:44] &gt;&gt; that he was really a humble man of God.
[42:48] Even when he was put to the test, when
[42:50] there were problems and they were
[42:52] questioning him, God was on the scene
[42:54] and helped him always.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; It says, "And
[43:00] as a
[43:02] priest
[43:04] went in after him with him, four priests
[43:08] of the Lord that were valiant men. Here
[43:11] we look." Now when you went
[43:14] into the temple
[43:18] to burn incense,
[43:21] that is why a church must be so
[43:23] protected. That's why there's such a
[43:25] thing as deacons. The prophet of God
[43:27] spoke about these things. You must just
[43:29] be careful. You can get a man that just
[43:32] possessed can just walk in. We have to
[43:34] guard
[43:36] beside Jesus.
[43:39] And as the the priest went in after him
[43:43] with him four priests of the Lord that
[43:46] was valiant men.
[43:48] And they would stood Uzziah the king and
[43:52] said unto him
[43:55] that it is not for him
[43:58] to burn incense into unto the Lord. It
[44:02] was not his responsibility.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; It was not his duty. It was not his
[44:07] office. Yes.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; If it's not your office, stay at your
[44:13] office.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; And if you feel that office is not
[44:16] enough, God knows the right time when
[44:18] you'll promote you from that office to
[44:19] the next office.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; You leave things in God's hand, not in
[44:22] the hands of man. Amen. That's right.
[44:32] And the Bible says,
[44:36] "And they would stood Uzziah the king,
[44:39] and said unto him, it's not for you,
[44:43] Uzziah, to burn this incense
[44:47] because it's only for the priests,
[44:50] the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated
[44:53] to burn incense.
[44:55] go out of the sanctuary
[44:58] for thou has trespassed.
[45:01] It was another office.
[45:03] But he used to look at himself to be
[45:05] such a great man. The king,
[45:10] the in authority,
[45:14] yes, the king is a great man. What he
[45:17] says,
[45:19] it's taken into effect. Amen. Whatever
[45:21] he says.
[45:23] And here he thought he was he was hit.
[45:26] He was a man. He can do what he wants to
[45:29] do.
[45:33] And he was going to now burn incense
[45:37] in the temple of God.
[45:42] 19 Then Uzziah
[45:44] was rot and he had a sensor in his hand
[45:48] to burn incense. And while he was rot
[45:52] with the priest, the leprosy even rose
[45:55] up
[45:58] &gt;&gt; in his forehead
[46:00] &gt;&gt; before the priest in the house of the
[46:03] Lord from beside the incense altar.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; God
[46:10] doesn't play with his word.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; God keeps to his word
[46:16] &gt;&gt; and he will keep to all what he has
[46:18] said.
[46:22] We want to
[46:24] talk about your calling. No matter what
[46:26] you've been called
[46:29] &gt;&gt; as a believer,
[46:31] let us stay in our calling.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Let God
[46:36] &gt;&gt; take us higher up if he needs to.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; In a workplace, you can't be doing a job
[46:41] and then you go and say the supervisor,
[46:44] I'll do your job or go tell the manager,
[46:47] I'll do you. You have no authority. They
[46:49] kick you out.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; You're out.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; You have to stay at your responsibility.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; See, God's calling generally refers to
[47:01] God's invitation to participate in his
[47:04] purpose.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Calling is seen as a gift and a
[47:10] responsibility.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; It's a way to bring glory to God.
[47:19] And let's look at a few examples. Amen.
[47:24] When we look at uh King Saul
[47:28] in 1st Samuel
[47:30] 138-11,
[47:33] Saul offered sacrifices to God when he
[47:37] was supposed to wait for the prophet
[47:39] Samuel. There was a bit of a delay time
[47:43] &gt;&gt; and Samuel came a bit late. But here was
[47:46] Saul being a great man, king.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will take it upon myself."
[47:54] So he took it upon himself to do a
[47:57] office of somebody else. His
[48:01] impatience
[48:04] led him to perh to to perform a
[48:07] responsibility that was not his.
[48:15] We look at Kora in numbers 16.
[48:20] Can we turn to numbers 16? If you can
[48:23] just read verse 3, 4, and 5, and then
[48:28] verse 32, you see the Bible talks about
[48:32] how the her opened up. Amen.
[48:38] Numbers 16 verse 3, 4, and 5.
[48:44] Thereafter,
[48:46] verse 32.
[48:50] When we look at Kora, he was a live by
[48:54] birth.
[48:56] He was privileged to serve in the
[48:58] tabernacle.
[49:00] He had a sacred role
[49:03] despite his important position.
[49:08] He was not satisfied still.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; He was he was uh not content.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; That's another area of concern
[49:17] &gt;&gt; we have in today's time.
[49:19] We are sometime just not content with
[49:22] what we have.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; That's why there's so much of problems
[49:26] even in marriages.
[49:30] Maybe the sister will tell
[49:33] the brother, you know, you see the
[49:36] neighbor, they they change, they got
[49:39] another car now, you know, or they
[49:42] they're doing some extension to their
[49:44] house. And why you so behind it?
[49:50] And that is why these things ought to be
[49:52] discussed in homes.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; We ought to sit down
[49:57] and say this is what the Lord has
[49:59] provided. You remember the story when
[50:01] this poor man and and husband and wife
[50:05] and the prophet passed by there and yeah
[50:08] they said so much they earned the
[50:10] husband said and and this is for so much
[50:13] for groceries. This is so much for that
[50:15] and this is a dress that I saw. I
[50:17] probably will not make it this month but
[50:19] maybe next month I will you know be able
[50:22] to make it.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; And there was an understanding
[50:26] &gt;&gt; there was an agreement.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:29] And so much good it is to have that kind
[50:32] of sit together once a month and discuss
[50:35] your your your your your money side you
[50:38] know your uh discuss you know your
[50:41] budget and those things so that it's
[50:43] understood to both you know to the
[50:46] husband and to the wife but sometimes
[50:50] when she wants that she wants those
[50:52] things and then you go and you say let
[50:55] me make another uh what do you call it
[50:57] higher person
[51:01] on on on interest and and then end of
[51:04] the month come now you going to the
[51:06] families you're going to the pastor and
[51:08] saying I have this problem now and I
[51:11] cannot solve it and that becomes really
[51:14] a difficulty that becomes a mountain
[51:19] so here we see that
[51:21] ka
[51:27] He was by birth.
[51:30] He was privileged to serve in the
[51:32] tabernacle.
[51:34] He had a sacred role.
[51:38] Despite his important position,
[51:41] he was still not content with his
[51:44] calling.
[51:46] Furthermore, he was so upset. He was
[51:49] rebellious.
[51:53] He was rebellious.
[51:57] and he gathered 250 followers and
[52:01] challenged the authority of Moses
[52:05] and Aaron that was leading to a severe
[52:08] judgment.
[52:11] The 250 men who were offered incense
[52:14] were consumed
[52:17] by
[52:18] the heavenly fires.
[52:23] You know one thing about God is not a
[52:25] playmate.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; We must take it serious. Is God respect
[52:31] honor is the highest.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; In
[52:37] between you and me is the highest in our
[52:39] worship. Amen.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:41] The consequences of fora was
[52:46] that Dayton and Abraham
[52:50] they were swallowed by the hurt.
[52:56] That was a display of God's judgment
[53:00] &gt;&gt; on those who challenge God's appointed
[53:02] leaders.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Just be careful. I hope I'm not making
[53:08] you scared,
[53:09] &gt;&gt; but it's the truth. Just be careful.
[53:13] Don't play with fire. You get burnt.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Lesson here is stay humble.
[53:21] Stay in your position.
[53:25] Because if you read number 16, you're
[53:28] going to see the whole chapter there
[53:30] when you have time and you will see a
[53:33] man and understand it better.
[53:37] Then we're looking at David.
[53:45] When we look at the earlier part of
[53:47] David when he was was put his hands to
[53:49] the the heart
[53:52] we know that God was against it
[53:56] and God showed him but he took
[53:58] correction from the word of God.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; That was a good thing. He took
[54:01] correction from the word of God.
[54:04] He was anointed king also
[54:07] and he was corrected and it became the
[54:10] duty of the Levites to transport the
[54:12] ark, not the king's duty. According to 1
[54:16] Chronicles 15:2,
[54:21] God was not pleased with David's first
[54:24] attempt to move the ark of the covenant.
[54:27] It was done in an improper pagan way,
[54:32] &gt;&gt; pagan manner. And that was leading
[54:35] to death. Amen.
[54:37] Users death. Amen. As we know what
[54:40] happened to
[54:43] David realized the protocols and
[54:45] instructions
[54:47] that are only for the Levites to carry
[54:49] the ark.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; This morning church,
[54:57] let us realize what we carry within us.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. You can carry malice and all anger
[55:06] and all these things or you can carry
[55:08] God in you. Yes.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; You know in Matthew 1 I think it is
[55:13] there when he talks about uh Mary
[55:18] says when Joseph was reminded by the
[55:22] angel that what Mary is carrying within
[55:26] her is of the Holy Ghost. Yes.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Now what is Holy Ghost?
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Then later he says his name will be
[55:36] called Emanuel Jesus and and and and you
[55:40] see
[55:42] the godhead there.
[55:45] People don't see the godhead but you go
[55:47] in Matthew chapter one you will see the
[55:49] god there. It says and his name shall be
[55:53] called Jesus. Yeah.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; So that Holy Ghost name was what?
[55:59] Jesus
[56:01] one God
[56:03] &gt;&gt; not three gods
[56:05] &gt;&gt; so that the denomination world get all
[56:08] mixed up and they see three gods
[56:12] or they see three different ways they
[56:15] they they cannot explain to you they'll
[56:18] talk to you in halfway then they lost
[56:20] themselves but there's one God and the
[56:23] prophet of God showed that to us
[56:26] &gt;&gt; even spoke on water baptism
[56:29] He said father, son, holy ghost is one
[56:32] God.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; So here we see
[56:38] a blessing can become a test.
[56:45] And as long as Uzziah sought the Lord,
[56:48] he prospered.
[56:51] But when he became strong, his heart was
[56:54] lifted up to destruction.
[56:59] The lesson that we learn from here is
[57:01] sometimes the greater
[57:05] test is not hardship.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, hardship is a test. Yes, it is a
[57:12] test. But the greater test is but
[57:16] success.
[57:19] When we look at Isaiah,
[57:21] we look at his success.
[57:24] that made him think that blew his head
[57:26] up. Made him think he was it.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; He was a man of the hour.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; So sometimes the greatest test is not
[57:36] hardship but success.
[57:39] I know it's hard to understand this. How
[57:42] can success be such a painful thing? You
[57:45] know, can be a greater test because
[57:48] that's what happens when we succeed.
[57:50] When we success, when we get better in
[57:52] life, we sometime want to go astray.
[57:57] Nebuchadnezzar,
[57:59] he was lifted in pride and later humbled
[58:03] to eat grass.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; You know the story. Eat grass like a
[58:08] cattle.
[58:10] But he was a proud man.
[58:15] We look at Saul, he exalted as a king,
[58:18] but he was rejected for one thing,
[58:21] disobedience.
[58:23] [Music]
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Disobedience. God doesn't like.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Pride leads us out of God's boundaries
[58:36] and takes us away.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:39] Uzziah entered the temple to burn
[58:41] incense.
[58:43] A priest's duty, not the king's. The
[58:46] king's
[58:48] duty was not to burn incense. It was the
[58:52] priest's responsibility.
[58:55] Pride makes us ignore God's order and
[58:59] roles and authority.
[59:01] That's what pride does.
[59:04] It fleshes so much in us.
[59:08] It makes us to ignore what God wants out
[59:12] of us. And God will be speaking to your
[59:14] heart and still you'll ignore that and
[59:16] you'll go do something different.
[59:20] The lesson that we learn here, Amen. is
[59:24] position in one area doesn't give us
[59:28] authority in all areas.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; I'll repeat it. position in one area
[59:36] does not give us a quality in all areas.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; You can be a king
[59:44] but it's not your office to go to the
[59:47] priesthood and take day responsibility.
[59:54] When we look at Kora
[59:57] he rebelled.
[59:59] He was wanting the priestly office and
[1:00:02] he was judged by God
[1:00:06] because
[1:00:08] you wanted somebody else's office.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Church, let's stay at our calling.
[1:00:17] Whether you wipe the chairs,
[1:00:20] whether you clean the carpet,
[1:00:22] [Music]
[1:00:24] whether you do home visitation,
[1:00:27] no matter what is the calling that you
[1:00:31] are doing.
[1:00:33] Yes, maybe you want to you like that
[1:00:34] calling, you speak to your maker. You
[1:00:37] speak to God. Let God handle everything.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; But stay at your calling. Stay at your
[1:00:43] responsibility. Stay at your duty.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you will see the hand of God.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; When you look at Lucifer,
[1:00:54] nobody likes the name Lucifer.
[1:00:57] Lucifer does a lot of damages.
[1:01:01] And when you look at Lucifer in Isaiah
[1:01:03] 14,
[1:01:08] God had to kick him down
[1:01:12] because he was, you know,
[1:01:17] saying things
[1:01:21] to assert more authority and more power
[1:01:24] over the angels.
[1:01:26] And he put words into the angels. Yes.
[1:01:29] May I say it that way?
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; And finally he was kicked down.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; And what he did when he was kicked down
[1:01:37] anyone
[1:01:40] where the first place he went after that
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; he went to had him and he
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; and he messed up the plan of God.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; That was why God kicked him down
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; because he was messing up there. By the
[1:01:56] time God could do anything else, he
[1:01:58] missed the plan of God. He came in
[1:02:02] between
[1:02:05] and pride ends in shame.
[1:02:09] When God struck Isaiah with leprosy,
[1:02:11] instantly
[1:02:13] he became isolated. He lived until
[1:02:16] death.
[1:02:18] Remember, not just for strength. He was
[1:02:20] not just remembered for strength.
[1:02:22] Remember, he was a strong man. The Bible
[1:02:24] says
[1:02:26] he was a great man.
[1:02:29] He was so great. They spoke about him
[1:02:32] outside
[1:02:34] the other area, other countries,
[1:02:36] other surroundings,
[1:02:39] outside Egypt.
[1:02:42] But not just only because
[1:02:47] of that, but also because of pride.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Pride is such a sad thing. And
[1:02:54] You know we must just be humble in
[1:03:00] again the lesson that we learn
[1:03:03] always
[1:03:05] pride always brings downfall. Proverbs
[1:03:08] 16:18 he says pride goeth before
[1:03:13] destruction.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Pride goeth before destruction
[1:03:18] and an arty spirit before a fall. Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; An artist before a fall.
[1:03:27] You look at
[1:03:30] he received glory as a god.
[1:03:34] He was struck by an angel.
[1:03:40] So there's many others. Amen.
[1:03:44] May you know you may be gifted, talented
[1:03:47] and even in eye position.
[1:03:52] But beware, pride can make you step out
[1:03:55] of God's calling
[1:03:57] and destroy what God built in you.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; And therefore, it's important you stay
[1:04:03] humble.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Stay in your lane.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Stay in your lane.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And give all glory to God.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Therefore, the Bible says God resisteth
[1:04:15] the the proud but giveth grace to the
[1:04:19] humble.
[1:04:20] It's in James 4. Amen. Verse 6.
[1:04:29] This morning we want God to have his way
[1:04:31] in us.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Of the messages the influence of another
[1:04:37] says Uzziah did that because he got
[1:04:40] lifted up.
[1:04:42] He got lifted up much higher. And now we
[1:04:46] see what he tried to do. Now what really
[1:04:51] got him when he got lifted up in his
[1:04:54] heart? We are told in the Bible in
[1:04:57] Chronicles the 26th chapter which we
[1:05:00] read. Amen.
[1:05:02] We find out that he went into the temple
[1:05:05] of the Lord with a sensor in his hand to
[1:05:08] burn incense unto the Lord. And when he
[1:05:11] did the minister
[1:05:13] put a stop to that.
[1:05:15] minister of the temple would force call
[1:05:17] other ministers followed him and told
[1:05:20] him don't do that you are wrong you are
[1:05:25] not a minister
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; in other words you are not a priest
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; you are a king
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; not a priest
[1:05:35] he was very upset
[1:05:40] and he was ro and he flew up and his
[1:05:44] temper got away from him and he lift the
[1:05:48] sensor to go any anywhere. He didn't
[1:05:52] worry. He said, "I'm going to do it
[1:05:55] because he was a king.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; He had authority. He had power." But how
[1:06:00] you assert your power and authority is
[1:06:02] another thing. Be careful each one of us
[1:06:06] here. Amen. How we assert our power and
[1:06:09] our authority even in your own family.
[1:06:12] Yes. You know as I said those days when
[1:06:15] we came into the message
[1:06:18] man you know thought that you know yes
[1:06:20] he was the the leader in the house. Yes
[1:06:23] he was in charge of the family but some
[1:06:26] of them thought they were gods you know
[1:06:29] and they were really reckless.
[1:06:31] But as the years went by we learned to
[1:06:34] understand that this message so much
[1:06:37] better
[1:06:39] and God has been favorable to help us
[1:06:41] and guide us. and show us what is a
[1:06:45] family and all these things. We all made
[1:06:47] our mistakes once upon a time. That is
[1:06:50] where we want a lesson. Now, if this man
[1:06:54] which God had blessed in his capacity
[1:06:58] but he wasn't satisfied with that, he
[1:07:00] wanted to take somebody else's place.
[1:07:04] You can't be nothing.
[1:07:10] He says now as long as he remained king,
[1:07:14] he was a blessing to the people
[1:07:19] as a king. He was a great blessing to
[1:07:20] the people being a king. But when he
[1:07:24] thought he was a minister,
[1:07:27] he thought because God had blessed him,
[1:07:30] God had brought him so high up, he was
[1:07:33] the man for the for the moment. He could
[1:07:36] be anything he wanted to be. But he was
[1:07:40] a blessing to the people as a king.
[1:07:45] And that was a high authority,
[1:07:48] the highest authority.
[1:07:50] But still he was not satisfied.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; But not a blessing. He became a curse
[1:07:57] upon them as he tried to take the
[1:08:01] minister's place. Tried to take the
[1:08:03] priest place.
[1:08:07] And we have a lot of that.
[1:08:10] Everybody wants
[1:08:13] the prophet says to pack the ball. It
[1:08:14] talks about the ball game. Amen.
[1:08:20] And today we have the same thing. He
[1:08:22] says when we see God come on the scene
[1:08:27] and going to bless a certain thing let's
[1:08:30] keep all our enemies away from it
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; and let us use our influences and
[1:08:36] tackles
[1:08:38] not run runner tackles that protects the
[1:08:41] runner. Let him pack the ball right way.
[1:08:44] He's talking about a soccer game how you
[1:08:46] play the ball right because there's no
[1:08:48] opposition. All he has to do is just
[1:08:52] keep running and we should be catless.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; In other words, let us just guard this
[1:08:59] message.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Let us put a guard around this message.
[1:09:04] Amen.
[1:09:06] Let us have longsuffering for our
[1:09:09] brother,
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; longsuffering for our sister. Sometimes
[1:09:13] we wonder, I mean, you know, how he
[1:09:15] can't see this message. He's so long in
[1:09:17] the church. Oh, she can't dress like a
[1:09:20] proper Christian. You take it to God in
[1:09:23] prayer and you'll see the hand of God.
[1:09:25] My brother,
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; you know,
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; we can preach from the pulpit. It's not
[1:09:31] going to make a difference, but you take
[1:09:33] it to God in your prayer. It'll make
[1:09:35] even a greater difference.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; God will hear. He has more time to hear
[1:09:39] to that prayer. But when we start
[1:09:42] throwing stones,
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; then it's not good. M
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; many times in a church, a little church,
[1:09:50] you can have a revival going on. Someone
[1:09:53] will want to go out here and lead a
[1:09:56] prayer meeting and then he's got a
[1:09:58] different idea from what really the
[1:10:01] Bible says.
[1:10:03] But he believes it this way anyhow. He
[1:10:06] believes it this way and he will start
[1:10:08] and influence and draw others away from
[1:10:11] it.
[1:10:13] The thing to do is to protect this
[1:10:17] message the way it's going stay right
[1:10:20] with it and knock everything away from
[1:10:23] it if we are ever going to cross the
[1:10:26] gold line. All right.
[1:10:31] And I said, "Brethren,
[1:10:33] there is something wrong.
[1:10:36] You fellows are businessmen." You talk
[1:10:38] about the businessmen, they want to take
[1:10:40] over the pulpit and all those things.
[1:10:42] You see the first place you don't
[1:10:45] understand the approach.
[1:10:48] You don't understand the approach to the
[1:10:50] ministry
[1:10:53] because the ministry is a God called
[1:10:56] gift.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; It's not for Tom, Dick, and Harry. It's
[1:11:00] a God called gift. Amen.
[1:11:05] That is from the message influence of
[1:11:07] another.
[1:11:12] Now pray here we see Uzziah he got
[1:11:14] lifted up and he thought what a great
[1:11:17] fellow I am so much he got lifted up
[1:11:21] till he tried to take the place of the
[1:11:24] priest. He goes into the temple
[1:11:27] which he took picked up the sensor of
[1:11:30] fire and went up to the altar of
[1:11:32] incense. Now that
[1:11:36] now that was only consecrated for
[1:11:39] the priests.
[1:11:42] He says, "Now I have said before, so say
[1:11:45] I again.
[1:11:48] Businessmen are not preachers."
[1:11:52] He says, "We preachers have enough time
[1:11:55] to try to keep this thing straight."
[1:11:59] The responsibility
[1:12:02] of the ministry, let alone businessmen.
[1:12:06] You all are businessmen, not ministers.
[1:12:09] And don't take the place of one or try
[1:12:12] to because you are not called for such.
[1:12:16] If you want somebody to speak at your
[1:12:20] convention, what do you do? Get a
[1:12:23] preacher.
[1:12:25] Get a preacher. Somebody that's called
[1:12:28] to do so. Because you see what a
[1:12:31] struggle
[1:12:32] we ministers have got already.
[1:12:36] And so you see what you do.
[1:12:39] And Isaiah here, he tried to take the
[1:12:43] place of a priest.
[1:12:46] He thought, well, God has blessed me.
[1:12:48] Why can't I do it?
[1:12:51] Don't you never get that in your head?
[1:12:56] God calls and predestinates,
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; four ordaines to his glory.
[1:13:03] You remember in the Bible when Moses was
[1:13:05] bringing Israel out of Egypt across
[1:13:09] though to the promised land, do you
[1:13:12] remember one in there
[1:13:15] and those who got lifted up and said,
[1:13:18] "Now wait a minute, Moses. You try to be
[1:13:21] the only one on the beat. There's other
[1:13:25] holy men among you."
[1:13:28] But Moses was
[1:13:31] called by God to perform his
[1:13:33] responsibility.
[1:13:35] That's why we have to respect one
[1:13:37] another's office. We need to realize,
[1:13:41] Amen. that God put that man in the
[1:13:44] office. God put that man
[1:13:49] in this area. Let him be respected. And
[1:13:52] God said, "Separate yourself. I will
[1:13:54] destroy them." And you know what God
[1:13:56] done? He opened the earth in time of
[1:13:59] Moses
[1:14:00] and he destroyed them and he burnt them
[1:14:03] and he said separate yourself for I will
[1:14:05] destroy them. God had ordained a certain
[1:14:08] thing to be done and it must be done
[1:14:10] that way.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; We are not to inject our own ideas.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; We are to respect his idea and his
[1:14:17] commandment.
[1:14:20] Now, not referring back to he says to
[1:14:22] our sisters, no matter what the other
[1:14:24] woman does, God has got your pattern
[1:14:28] laid here for you.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; No matter what some other layman done in
[1:14:32] the Bible, God has got your pattern here
[1:14:35] what to do. We will get to it after a
[1:14:38] while because he says that the layman is
[1:14:41] is to do and the minister and all of us.
[1:14:44] He's talking about later about church
[1:14:46] order and all the things. But now we
[1:14:48] find out that this man got lifted up. So
[1:14:52] he took the sensor went for to the altar
[1:14:55] which was only permitted by God to the
[1:14:59] right office palace. He tried to take
[1:15:02] the minister's place and that was what
[1:15:05] caused the biggest problem and he ended
[1:15:07] up with leprosy on
[1:15:10] and then the minister tried to collect
[1:15:13] him. We find out that four SC priests 80
[1:15:17] priests
[1:15:18] had to stop him from doing that. Beside
[1:15:22] the eye priest, 81 priests come after
[1:15:25] him and told him, "Sir," in other words
[1:15:29] like this, "God has blessed you. You are
[1:15:33] an honored man."
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; You are an honored man. You are a great
[1:15:39] man and God has blessed you in your
[1:15:42] work. You shouldn't do that. You're
[1:15:45] getting out of the beaten roads. So this
[1:15:51] morning, we are to take
[1:15:55] a lesson from the word of God.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; And understand, Amen. I just like to
[1:16:01] read one and close. Amen. And
[1:16:04] understand, Amen.
[1:16:07] what God wants from us. Amen.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe this morning
[1:16:13] God is speaking to us. Amen.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:18] The prophet of God says in perfect
[1:16:20] strength by perfect weakness in page 11
[1:16:25] he says then in paragraph 68
[1:16:30] then God can achieve his purpose
[1:16:34] by sending not a revival but brother
[1:16:38] what he needs to do first is send a
[1:16:42] killing.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; We need to die first. Amen. Yeah,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; that's right. So we can revive.
[1:16:50] You have to die
[1:16:53] before you can be born again.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; You have to die before you can be born
[1:16:58] again.
[1:17:00] He needs a killing of ourselves.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; And then he says about don't tabernacle.
[1:17:05] He says this tabernacle needs a killing
[1:17:08] and me with it.
[1:17:10] That's humbleness of the prophet. He
[1:17:12] says, "And me with it." And all of us,
[1:17:16] we need a killing so that we can be
[1:17:18] revived in a new life,
[1:17:21] a new hold,
[1:17:24] a new hope,
[1:17:26] a new experience.
[1:17:29] And we need first a day of mourning.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; We got to get away from that, from that
[1:17:38] human ability. We got to get to a place
[1:17:42] where we can surrender our souls and
[1:17:46] live even to the housewife, to the
[1:17:49] farmer, to the mechanic or whatever we
[1:17:51] are. We got to surrender completely to
[1:17:54] God and know that we are nothing.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; That we are nothing. Then let God start
[1:18:02] from there. Then he starts moving,
[1:18:05] working and that includes all of us.
[1:18:10] History proves
[1:18:13] does right now proves history proves
[1:18:15] that God always chose the nobody's
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; to become the somebody's
[1:18:22] God takes a person that's nothing to
[1:18:26] make somebody shall we stand to our feet
[1:18:29] this morning God bless
[1:18:33] Amen to your hearts and I pray that
[1:18:36] you'll be invited by his precious Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; You know the wonderful thing about this
[1:18:44] gospel that we are speaking of. Amen.
[1:18:48] It comes amen
[1:18:50] from the heart of God. Amen.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; That is what is wonderful. Amen. It
[1:18:54] comes from the heart of God. Hallelujah.
[1:18:59] You know in what think of Christ
[1:19:04] paragraph 9 he says that's my eternal
[1:19:07] life.
[1:19:09] If I don't feel this natural man,
[1:19:16] it will die.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; If I don't feed this natural man, it
[1:19:21] will die.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; As I said earlier, and if I don't feed
[1:19:26] this spiritual man, it will die.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; So, you got two feeding to do.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; But let us concentrate more on that
[1:19:35] spiritual man this morning. Amen.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Time tested memorial of God.
[1:19:42] He says that's the way God does his
[1:19:46] church.
[1:19:48] He gives you trials after trials.
[1:19:53] I want to encourage you this morning and
[1:19:56] I want you to remember this last quote
[1:19:58] that I'm reading. You'll go through
[1:20:00] trials after trials. Don't feel you are
[1:20:03] the only one going through that.
[1:20:06] Just remember your neighbor, your
[1:20:09] brother, your sister is also going
[1:20:10] through it. Says that's the way God does
[1:20:13] his church. He gives you trials after
[1:20:17] trials. He gives you tests after test
[1:20:21] until the life of Christ is reflected.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in your life
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; until the life of Christ is reflected in
[1:20:32] your life. Until you become peaceful,
[1:20:38] sober,
[1:20:41] meek,
[1:20:43] gentle,
[1:20:45] humble,
[1:20:47] ready,
[1:20:49] submissive,
[1:20:52] willing.
[1:20:54] Turn your head from the things of the
[1:20:56] world
[1:20:58] and looking straight to Calvary to the
[1:21:01] one
[1:21:03] to the one the one that's doing the
[1:21:06] beating
[1:21:08] this morning. God is doing the beating
[1:21:10] in your life. Look to him. Amen.
[1:21:14] I pray that you have been edified by the
[1:21:17] word of God this morning.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that
[1:21:22] the word of God is the most powerful
[1:21:25] weapon that we have. Amen. In this time
[1:21:27] that we are living in. And let us stay
[1:21:30] close by his side. Amen. I pray that
[1:21:33] I'll be governed. Amen. By God's words
[1:21:36] this morning. I wonder if we can sing a
[1:21:38] song. Amen.
[1:21:40] I want to live the way you wants me to
[1:21:43] live.
[1:21:46] Do you want to live the way
[1:21:49] of God? Amen. This day, amen.
[1:21:54] I want to live
[1:21:59] the way
[1:22:02] and he wants me
[1:22:06] to live.
[1:22:09] I want to hear
[1:22:14] until this.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; I want to love.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:28] Love
[1:22:30] is just as you
[1:22:34] love.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; But I can never
[1:22:40] ever love
[1:22:43] the Lord.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; I want to live.
[1:22:48] I want to live
[1:22:53] the way
[1:22:55] that he wants me
[1:22:59] to
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; and the service
[1:23:03] God's servant our precious brother.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; May God bless you. Amen.

[1:23:14] I want to love
[1:23:20] you.
[1:23:22] Just know
[1:23:24] [Music]
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; I could never
[1:23:31] ever
[1:23:33] [Music]
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Were you blessed through the word
[1:23:40] of the Lord?
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even as our brother was
[1:23:43] ministering. Amen. Stay in your office.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
