[4:33] first after the troubling of the water
[4:35] stepped in was made whole of whatsoever
[4:39] disease he
[4:41] had and a certain man was there which
[4:43] had an infirmity 38 years when Jesus saw
[4:48] him lie and knew that he had been now a
[4:50] long time in that case he said unto him
[4:53] will thou be made
[4:56] whole the important man answered sir I
[4:59] have no man when the water is trouble to
[5:03] put me into the pool but while I'm
[5:05] coming another
[5:07] step down before me Jesus said unto him

[8:15] whole you can be cleansed you can be
[8:18] delivered amen and how excited he must
[8:20] have been his friends must have carried
[8:22] him to the pool and laid him down
[8:24] there but nobody knew the time that the
[8:28] angel of God would come down amen yes
[8:31] and the first one that saw the angel
[8:33] stir up the waters and stepped in first
[8:35] was the one that got
[8:38] healed

[8:43] before him yet he was not
[8:48] discouraged
[8:50] amen this man was strong in
[8:54] faith amen after year one they took him
[8:56] back home am and he lay with his
[9:00] infirmity probably had to deal with the
[9:02] symptoms the sicknesses the disease
[9:04] probably had to go to doctors probably
[9:06] had to go through the
[9:08] cycle of dealing with the sickness but
[9:11] year two came and he went back with the
[9:14] same
[9:15] enthusiasm amen this man was not
[9:18] discouraged amen and for somebody to
[9:21] come back after 38 years showed you that
[9:24] this man had faith in
[9:27] God that this man was a believer
[9:30] yes amen he wasn't discouraged he didn't
[9:32] say oh I've been going there year after
[9:34] year and I've not experienced the move
[9:36] of
[9:37] God he didn't say that that place is so
[9:40] full of important folk that there's no
[9:42] need for me to go there I I I've been
[9:44] there enough I've tried my luck and and
[9:46] there's no hope for
[9:50] me amen what was he persistent amen

[14:53] there should be healings after the
[14:55] prophet yes we've had the final sign
[14:58] amen brother the final sign was the back
[15:00] turn to
[15:05] us but here comes the glory of the
[15:09] Lord here comes the glory of the
[15:13] Lord from a many membered body marching
[15:16] Onward Christian Soldiers Amen brother
[15:21] Brandon was a type of the Bride right
[15:23] why wasn't he marching in the line with
[15:25] the bride where was he watching from
[15:27] amen
[15:29] yes the vision sounds like he was
[15:30] watching from a
[15:32] dimension come
[15:35] on he should have been leading
[15:38] them as the messenger of the age but he
[15:41] said I saw this bride
[15:45] marching Hallelujah he didn't say he was
[15:48] there in the midst of them he said I saw
[15:50] marching and she was marching like that
[15:53] first church amen Christ in the church
[15:55] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[15:58] and this was marching marching marching
[16:01] but he says one of two of them started
[16:02] to get out of
[16:03] line and I screamed stay in line
[16:08] amen amen and then that's not the last
[16:11] thing he saw he said he saw this bride
[16:13] go
[16:13] [Music]
[16:14] up amen amen
[16:18] hallelujah glory be to his name amen so
[16:21] I'm encouraging you don't be discouraged
[16:24] by your situation yes your trial yes
[16:28] what your going through somebody was
[16:30] trying to convince us that the state of
[16:32] the youth is a terrible
[16:36] State trying to convince us that the
[16:39] Messi church has failed the
[16:42] youth and I couldn't identify with him
[16:44] that's right
[16:46] amen you see what the problem is parent
[16:50] delinquency now you blame the youth but
[16:54] I could not identify with him that's
[16:56] right amen he he says nobody out of my
[16:59] generation beside him now he's
[17:01] glorifying himself came
[17:04] out but I can't identify that the
[17:08] brothers and sisters that I grew up with
[17:09] are still standing strong in the message
[17:11] of the
[17:13] hour people want to use psychology with
[17:15] the youth you know what happened in the
[17:16] early days yeah that that brought this
[17:19] music into the church Kirk Franklin and
[17:21] all of this
[17:23] music the people didn't want to lead
[17:25] them to an experience of the Holy Ghost
[17:30] they themselves didn't have the Holy
[17:32] Ghost I'm talking about denominational
[17:34] churches they didn't have the Holy Ghost
[17:36] because they let the Holy Ghost and they
[17:38] had gone after material
[17:41] things so what they said is exact words
[17:45] now I had conversations with pastors
[17:47] used to come byy music from CLE sound
[17:49] systems from clean CLE
[17:51] music we need to buy the sound we need
[17:53] to buy the lights because we are losing
[17:56] our young people to the world
[18:02] we are losing our young people to the
[18:04] world so we need to bring this in to the
[18:08] church and play some upbit
[18:11] music and get some dance teams and let
[18:14] them do
[18:17] this let the young girls come forward
[18:20] and start
[18:22] dancing while the men look at them eye
[18:27] candy
[18:30] let the woman come up let them lead
[18:32] worship with their short skirts and the
[18:34] pastor is enjoying the
[18:39] show and God was not
[18:42] exalted but they were exalting
[18:45] flesh then they got the best of singers
[18:48] and the focus got taken away from the
[18:50] worship and the saw words going up to
[18:52] the Lord and they were impressed with
[18:54] the
[18:56] voices and they got the most skilled
[18:58] musicians and they were impressed with
[19:00] the musician and the
[19:03] skillfulness and the attention and the
[19:05] glory got taken away from the
[19:09] Lord my point is this I'm still driving
[19:13] the point people that are supposed to be
[19:16] men of God can't lead others to the Holy
[19:21] [Music]
[19:22] Ghost so they rather Lead You Down path
[19:25] of
[19:27] psychology they rather Lead You Down
[19:29] Pathways like that and tell you that the
[19:32] youth are
[19:33] finished and we need to have some
[19:36] psychological teaching and says they
[19:38] don't need to sit in the service and
[19:40] you're preaching I tell you brother you
[19:42] need to sit in the church and you need
[19:44] to come under the anointing of the Holy
[19:45] Ghost until the Holy Ghost convicts you
[19:48] amen amen
[19:50] yes I say I couldn't identify with it
[19:54] because right in the church we got young
[19:57] men yes amen that grew up in the church
[20:02] amen young men yeah how old
[20:05] three 3 years

[20:25] trophies of God this is what the power
[20:27] of the Gospel can
[20:30] do yes you may be
[20:33] seated I would rather lead you to an
[20:36] experience with the Holy Ghost
[20:38] AM then to try and Pat you let's play a
[20:44] game piggy C be my
[20:49] friend what do you

[21:43] had an experience with the Lord stay
[21:45] under the anointing stay under the
[21:46] covering until you have an experience
[21:48] amen amen so that's why I say I couldn't
[21:51] identify with
[21:53] him because we've come through a
[21:55] different experience amen we've come
[21:58] through different leaderships
[22:00] amen amen so you can't paint the whole
[22:03] picture with one

[32:18] building upon your Most Holy Faith that
[32:21] is why you are being pulled down and
[32:23] dragged down let me tell you demon
[32:25] powers are here to pull you down
[32:28] this is the age where the fourth Rider
[32:30] has gone forth and H is loose upon the
[32:32] Earth and demon powers are not just
[32:35] operating in the realm of the
[32:39] Lost he's got

[32:57] to our position Satan is powerless am
[33:01] demon powers are
[33:03] powerless you see you you may be
[33:06] thinking what what use is all of this
[33:08] Revelation that I know in the message
[33:11] what is the benefit of knowing all the
[33:13] Revelation that God has revealed to me
[33:15] in the message of the hour Jesus said
[33:17] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[33:19] against
[33:22] Revelation you say but I'm learning
[33:24] about baptism I'm learning about the
[33:26] godhead I'm learning about the seven
[33:28] Church ages and The Messengers and how
[33:30] God worked through seven Church ages I'm
[33:32] learning about the seals I'm learning
[33:34] about the horse riders I'm learning
[33:35] about amen the seven trumpets I'm
[33:38] learning about the seven vials I'm
[33:39] learning amen about all of these
[33:43] things but
[33:47] Revelation like the prophet says when
[33:50] the bride gets a revelation of who she
[33:53] is what she is that she can do the
[33:56] Greater Works Yes she'll be an
[33:58] invincible Army and if she can recognize
[34:01] the two Spirits within the framework of
[34:03] the Christian church and withand the
[34:05] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[34:08] powerless before her amen amen so let me

[34:15] makes Satan
[34:18] powerless
[34:22] amen your Revelation makes Satan
[34:25] powerless
[34:29] when you stand there as a Son of
[34:33] God you speak and things start to
[34:36] operate things start to obey your voice

[34:40] a son and daughter of God

[34:45] Miracle every single thing that happened

[34:51] Authority and you recognize your
[34:53] position as a Son of God Amen as a
[34:56] daughter of God and you begin to open up
[34:59] your mouth and

[35:26] you to come from point A to point B

[35:30] the way and it seems impossible for you
