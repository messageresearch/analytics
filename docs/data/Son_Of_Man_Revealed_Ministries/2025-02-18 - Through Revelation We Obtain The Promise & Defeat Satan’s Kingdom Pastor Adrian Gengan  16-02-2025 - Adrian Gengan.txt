========================================

have time to read it now about how God answers amen maybe not according to our time and season but according to his own time he says if he answered immediately we would never learn patience but he wants to teach us amen develop us as a son and daughter of God Amen so let's uh Stand Together amen as we turn to the word of the Lord praise the Lord we'll turn to Exodus chapter 23 read from verse 20 Exodus 23 and: 20 says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way amen so when he introduces the angel he's just introducing him as an angel but you'll see 23 will'll change it into a more personal thought I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared so no son and daughter of God is going without leadership amen that's the first Exodus it happened in the second Exodus it must happen in the third so I want you to rest assured there's an Angel going before you if you're a son and daughter of God called amen into the shout message at this end time there's an Angel going before you beware of him obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him amen hallelujah but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries so nothing can happen to a child of God Amen without God being involved praise the Lord this is the verse I love for M angel now he makes it personal not just an angel M Angel shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites itits perizzites Canaanites evites and jebusites and I will cut them off amen praise the Lord we'll go to Hebrews chapter 11 amen praise the Lord amen we can just read verse one amen now Faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen you may be seated the Lord had blessings the reading of his word amen so if I title this I just want to title it through revelation we obtain the promise and defeat Satan's kingdom amen amen now we know that faith is a revelation the prophet teaches us that faith is a revelation we cannot progress in the kingdom of God without Revelation therefore we've had a prophetic word released to the bride Amen to bring her into revelation amen amen God didn't leave us amen without an understanding of the word in fact the Hidden Mysteries have been revealed to us and though it sound foreign to the church world and they can't understand these Hidden Mysteries it's because of Revelation and that Jean seed that God has placed within us that we are able to understand these things amen now God don't use intellectual knowledge God don't use intellectualism amen we can't use our own intellect to understand the kingdom of God without the Holy Spirit if we sit down with the church age books Seven Seals books and all the messes messages and try to understand it from a human standpoint we will never get the revelation of the message because it's hidden in Simplicity and revealed to those who have a genene seed I'm saying this message is not revealed to anybody it's revealed to those that have the Jean seed locked up inside of them amen and what a special class of people we are amen so we know that God anoints Sons and Daughters who have a gen SE in this hour amen hallelujah so I'm trying to show you that we are a special class of people that we are sitting sitting here today not great in the eyes of the world in the eyes of the world not much to look at but we carry something on the inside of us that is why science is trying to progress at a rapid rate because God is quickening his Gene seed so they are trying to modify the gene seed in man and try to make that genene seed perfect Hallelujah you understand science is trying to catch up with what God is doing yes they are trying to eliminate sicknesses by amen touching the gene that's in a man touching genetics they saying they can remove cancer they can remove heart trouble they can remove sugar diabetes by tampering with the gene Hallelujah but God is saying I can take you from mortality to immortality because of the Gen seed that's within you Hallelujah but they will never catch up to God God is just allowing them to probe in his laboratory God is just allowing them to Temple with things God is allowing science to progress because of the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah he's allowing them into the laboratory because there are certain things amen that needs to be unlocked at this time in season amen and can only be unlocked in this time in season now those that carry the jeene seed amen you are worth the prophet say 10,000 ,000 worlds 10,000 worlds and if it means the great creator of heavens and earth the one that formed amen the galaxies were just his breath amen that said let there be and there was if it means that he must now take on the form of Flesh to come and save you save me that was lost amen he is not amen he's willing to even do that take on the robe of Flesh take on the robe of humility leave all of of heaven and come down in the form Amen in the stinking stable and come and die for you and I not only die but resurrect and because he resurrects we live also amen because Jesus said amen in the you know it's written there in John 3:16 God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life our lord Jesus also said all that the father has given me will come to me amen and not one of them is lost who is he talking about you and I the ones with Jean seeds hallelujah amen the father was veiled in flesh and mocked amen he was beaten ridiculed spat upon murdered but he rose again amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord because he won't leave his sons and daughters trapped in Satan's Eden Hallelujah so we are precious in His sight Jesus loves the little children all his children in the world red and yellow black and white they are precious in His sight Jesus loves the children of the world talking about his jeene seed amen hallelujah now the prophet also tells us that Jesus was the fullness of the word now he's trying to get this point across to the people and he's telling us that we individually are are the word how many of you believe you are the word yes amen now he says Jesus was the fullness of the word so you are to exist in Jesus amen yes amen come on now get the thought that Prophet is trying to convey now he's saying each one of us are an expression of the word we are the word manifested but he's saying when Jesus was made flesh the fullness of the word was locked up in Jesus am you know that's John chapter 1 the word was made flesh in the beginning was the word what was with God what was God and the word became flesh so that scene is exactly how when God created Adam amen he was locked up inside of Adam so when Jesus comes to the Earth the bride who is the word is locked up in the fullness of the word hallelujah so he says when he walked the streets of Jerusalem we walked the streets with him when he was beaten we were beaten when he was put on the cross we were put on the cross amen and when the Roman soldier put that spear in his side the bride was released amen hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen so we are part of Jesus we are part of the word that's why at this end time amen he's coming to unite back with his Jean seeds back with the word he will only Unite with the word in this time and season so his word as creative power and he sent a word bya the message of the hour to Quicken us and turn our heart back to the faith of the original father amen he opened up our Revelation he opened up the mysteries of God and we have a listening post within us this is not the clacking of an in amen we can't feed on the clacking of an in Jolo steam we can't feed on the clacking of an in t Jes that don't satisfy our soul amen hallelujah but when we listen to Revelation 10:7 amen when we hear the voice of Malachi chapter 4 our spirit settled down our soul is at ease amen we know that is God's voice sent to us amen amen hallelujah we are not trying to do away with the prophet we are not trying to sideline the prophet we are not trying to belittle the prophet because we know that we under our messenger become the final voice to the final age we are proud to be identified with William Mary and brandom amen he's the seven Church age Messengers he's one of the stars that Jesus held in his hand yes that's right amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen if we get to our first quote here I want to just read this it might be lengthy but I want to get this to the people brother brandom is saying Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts amen now continuation doesn't mean it'll be the same Hallelujah because what's in seed is not what's at the fruit Hallelujah yes praise the Lord continuation means that this bride will progress to a level where she'll be in his very own image and likeness where you can't tell her apart from the groom he says she is himen praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord now remember what I said brother Brandon says we've got to get into the spirit of things so if we yet to have church this morning we've got to get into the spirit of the word amen I want you to know this is not a sucker field so you can't get into the spirit of playing soccer right now you can't get into the spirit amen of trying to pass messages but you got to get into the spirit where you're in love with the bridegroom and he's sending a word to his people whispering love secrets to heren he says the Book of Revelation shows the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it look formal powerless now you know how that church ended there in Revelation CH 3 ladies here ended up this way because of that right the Antichrist spirit that moved in yes amen hallelujah making them lukewarm formal and Powerless and the in another message the prophet says God hates a dead religion yeah God hates amen anything that's lukang that's cold and formal amen hallelujah and and God don't expect his church of Amen in this last days who's been highly revelated the mind of Christ put into the bride to sit in the church as a dead Catholic person amen God is expecting amen A Hallelujah from you God is expecting an amen out of you he says amen it takes the Holy Ghost within you to say Amen to the word of God hallelujah what we need is quicking power back in the church amen where people are not afraid to get drunk with the Holy Spirit where people are not afraid to raise their hands people are not afraid to say praise the Lord people are not afraid to shout amen people are not afraid to get lost in his presence amen we don't want Church theology neither do we want message theology praise the Lord the Dynamics can only the mechanics can only do so much for you the mechanics can get a car prepared for you amen the mechanics can get it but if there's no spark there there is no life there amen he says what good it will be to just polish the hubs amen we don't want message showrooms here amen we don't want a message showroom where you say look at this person they dress so well look at this person they keeping all the laws well but we are looking for somebody with quickening power amen where the Holy Ghost is a living Temple a living Tabernacle praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen and we also don't want message popes we don't want message showrooms we don't want message popes hallelujah praise the Lord it exposes Satan revealing his Works amen right down to the time he's cast down into the Lake of Fire what is doing this Revelation yes how are you going to make it out of this age Revelation amen how are you going to defeat Satan and his armies Revelation amen amen what the groom did the bride must do praise the Lord you see he fights that he cannot stand it well if you can't stand it you better sit down you better get off my back who fights it Satan amen he's fighting Revelation now he fights that he cannot stand it he knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for she can do the Greater Works and somebody said Hallelujah I'm going to reread that because I I want you to understand what the prophet of God is saying he is not saying if she gets a revelation of who God is because Satan knows who God is come on somebody the Bible says Satan believes and he trembles right find me in that quote there where brother brandom is saying anything about God he knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church amen come on church are you a part of that church amen yes Lord and what she is we all know what he is but what she is who she is in Jesus Christ yes what she stands for Hallelujah this bright stands on the word of God this bride doesn't flow for anything our foundation is Jesus Christ my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand yes all other ground is sinking sandah amen wonderful I say not only can she do the Greater Works I say she is doing the Greater Works amen this was in the 1960s amen probably 65 but I say there's been a progression of time amen when the bride has been coming to maturity she knows who she is she knows what the word says about her and she is doing the Greater Works even now amen praise the Lord Lord the people get the true revelation of the true church what she stands for amen she can do the Greater Works she will be an invisible Army Lord sorry I want you to know if you go with mechanics only you'll be an invisible Army the Apostle Paul says I shall not to tell you the old Council of God I didn't preach amen man the word in letter only but in power and in demonstration am amen what we need is to too many of intellectual preachers to get out from behind the pilit amen we don't need just reading a bunch of quote but we need to see the power of God move in your life we need to see the power of God Amen in operation don't just tell me what the word of God can do I want to see a living reality hallelujah hallelujah amen we got too many professors amen professing this is what you can do this is what you can do but I've never seen you do it in the first place don't worry about that brother you just keep carrying on this is what you can do how about you show me some proof amen yes you can preach the word in such an intellectual way such a high way amen but you can't call ever for the prayer of faith can't call ever for to put a showdown amen and say these signs shall follow them that believe you saying you believe the entire open Word amen you know brother we've moved on from that brother BR says I'll show you where he put it in the church you show me where he took get out amen we make a challenge to you amen that nothing shall be able to stand before you amen nothing shall be able to stand before a son and daughter of God people are too afraid amen they've listened to the 10 spies amen that amen you can't go into the land praise the Lord amen they told them there was Giants in the land if you go and read the book of Joshua there is not one place to encounter Giants hello so they didn't enter the land because of a lie and when they did enter the LIE there was no Giants in the land praise the Lord so don't listen to message folks amen who are telling you you can come this far amen what telling you that there's days of Miracles are passed the greatest miracle that will happen is the changing of the bodies and brother brandom says if you don't have faith for Divine Healing how you going to have faith for Rapture amen right amen praise the Lord you know there was healing under the third pole the power of the spoken word amen hallelujah all they have is the power of the written word amen all people can do anyone can line up 10 quotes now read quote number one praise the Lord Brother can you put quote number five amen anybody can do that that's right I say I say we we do an investigation into the prayer life oh yes exposing I say we do an investigation into the prayer life I say it's very easy to prepare a sermon without preparation in this day you can get a quote you can get a verse and come and preach it to the people the people amen are happy because you didn't touch their life you just show them amen this this this this this highly intellectual they can't apply anything they H to their life when they go through a problem they don't know how to have overcoming power they don't know any such thing as they being Holy Ghost have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe the message of the hour is what we need to ask the people of God I thought the Holy Ghost was for the disciples only brother since Brandon fell asleep we haven't seen a move of God well we supposed to be a continuation from brother Brandon oh come on this church is supposed to be a continuation from Brother br yes if that's what we claim to be Revelation 108 to1 how come the power of God moved through William brandom through one man but he was called The Wave Chief showing you that many others would follow amen but I don't see the others following I see I call that a missed opportunity sir I call that a missed opportunity brother Brandon calls it a missed opportunity amen like the 12 Spies when there he says they missed the opportunity to get into the land because they listen Amen to the to the lies and the fear of these 10 spies amen what is it teaching us church not every voice that you hear in the message of the hour is going to be telling you amen he's not he's going to be encouraging you to get into the land of your promise amen come on we need a powerful church amen we need a Victorious church amen we don't want people living backsliding lives and just coming to hear the word of God in the Sunday and the Wednesday and going home we need to search see a church on fire a Church on the Move a church in progression amen amen praise the Lord the message didn't come to denominate us if you want to make it a denomination this is not the place for you amen amen this is the Church of the Living God where the power of God moves freely through the church where the Holy Ghost is moving freely amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen we we got too many Baptists in the message the Baptist love the word they'll give you word upon word upon word upon word amen but they call them cessationist they believe that the Holy Ghost was only with the apostles praise the Lord maybe they don't know who the Holy Ghost is what it was given for amen praise the Lord where are we in this quote he says she will be an invincible Army Not Invisible an invincible Army you know an invincible Army cannot be conquered Satan knows if you know who you are now he says you become an invincible Army amen he can't come before you yes praise the Lord you see what he did when Jesus got the holy ghost at the Jordan he ran behind him into the Wilderness let me go and see if he knows who he is he wanted to know if Jesus knew who he was in fact he wanted to make Jesus doubt what he heard at the Jordan because at the Jordan The Voice P this is my beloved Son amen hallelujah hallelujah so so he went to Temp Jesus to see if Jesus really believed that he was the son of God now you are hearing week after week you're a son and daughter of God Satan is coming to tempt you to see do you really believe you're a Son of God I'll put you to this trial I'll put you to this temptation three Temptations He says make the stone into bread Jesus said men shall not live by where did he go he went to the word yes how can we go to the word if we don't read the word amen we need to investigate Bible reading time we need to investigate prayer life we need to investigate amen our consecration we need to investigate fasting fasting strengthens prayer fasting amen puts the flesh aside amen brings a persecution upon the flesh amen some of you feel that's the worst persecution you rather go to the three and a half years persecution than to leave food when you're fasting you're saying oh I want to see him thinking about your food now not the Lord amen some people spend the entire week fasting and they're only thinking he you know when this fast finish what I'm going to do the first thing I'm going to eat they see their mind the spirit their body is not in full control now you forsaking that thing to strengthen your prayer you are seeking the Lord amen hallelujah we'll get to prayer just now amen if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian Church there are two spirits in the framework of the Christian Church brother Bram is saying it's important for you to get a revelation of it the quote is still continuing if I had to ask you can you recognize the two spirits in the framework of the Christian Church you must know that Revelation amen because the quote continues now amen there was two Spirits from the beginning can and Abel yes amen Jacob and Esau Hallelujah two Spirits coming there in in Matthew 25 five wise five foolish two Spirits amen the one Spirit finally had to recognize that the other Spirit had something they didn't have the thing that they had was making them the word made flesh so they said give us some of that how come you are becoming word made flesh how come what you have is making you more like Christ I want some of that praise the Lord let me ask you this did you receiving the message of the hour and amen under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and conforming to the word and transforming was it an easy process you had to forsake a lot you are to forsake all others and cleave only to him amen yes that is why she tells them I can't give it to you this came with a price amen amen the condition you find me in the word made flesh didn't come easy this was a process I had to come to justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost into the formed word image you think it's just easy for me to now that you see the final product you just want that you have got to go through the same process so go to them that are sing so they have to go back and look for the prophet's message because there's no way by one Spirit we are all baptized into the body you can't bypass any processes amen you can't bypass protocols so can we deser the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian Church By God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her amen so I don't care you can't come to me and Satan is talking to you how can a powerless person come to you and talk to you and you want to listen to the powerless person thank you Lord yes how many of you went school and there was a short bully come to you you think you'll be afraid of it one Thin scrawny bully short and he come and he's threatening you how many of you will be scared of him the prophet says when when we finally see Satan he says people wonder how did we ever get deceived by this little puny fellow because the Bible says he deceived the whole world praise the Lord am amen so he says will be powerless before her powerless now have you seen children playing take for example two children playing from different households let the one child go and take the other one's toy do they go there excuse me please can I have my toy back you seen children play what they say give me it's mine my daddy bought this and I'm saying people need to understand that their father is the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and they've got to know what he bought for them they've got to know what purchas on Calvary for them too many people don't know their rights they're living beneath their privileges we need to be like a little child and say give me back this is mine am thank you Jesus Hallelujah without fear sometime the parents get hey they talk nicely they more scared but the child knows how to reclaim the child knows how to reclaim what's this amen so don't go playing Mr Nice Guy to the devil excuse me Mr devil please can I have it back you you say please can I have it back or else you'll get a smack how many of you know how to smack the devil hey the prophet says pray is the most powerful weapon he says does say the Lord is like Atomic Warfare amen praise the Lord he says he can't stand it to see a Chris on his knees amen if you want to bring Devastation and M to Satan's kingdom get on your knees start praying amen yes thank you praise the Lord amen looks like today we'll only be able to read one quote amen we'll have to finish it off at the next service amen he says Satan will be powerless before he will be as differ tarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert Satan hates Revelation now I want you to know Satan wanted Jesus to take his life he put him up on the temple he says jump down Satan that's his tactics he tell you you're not worth it you're not good for nothing he'll send his angels charge over here Jesus said You shall not tempt the Lord your God what did Jesus knew he knew who he was praise the Lord Satan hates Revelation but we love it how many if you love Revelation I am saying amen I going not get to amen we've only got a few more minutes left but through revelation you obtain the promise and defeat Satan's kingdom or maybe I'm ahead of time here because of the testimonies that happened praise the Lord Satan hates Revelation but we love it yes amen I need to hear the Church of God say we love Revelation yes with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it amen amen so no matter what Satan prays against you Satan's kingdom cannot Prevail against you amen this is a highly revelated bride amen and remember faith is a revelation so she's moving in perfect Faith Right Now Praise the Lord you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in future ages I mentioned it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it so if you believe the message of the Lord the message of the hour it was the Holy Spirit leading you he says without the Holy Spirit you'll fail to get it so don't ever doubt whether you are being led by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost LED you to the message thank you Lord you can't believe this message with intellect correct amen so if anyone ask you did you ever have an encounter with the Holy Spirit yes look where I am right now I believe the message of the hour I believe God sent a prophet my heart is turned back to the faith of the fathers amen amen look at my Revelation amen look at me the word made flesh right now I know who I am Christ is being revealed through me I didn't end up here amen by any other human leadership but the Holy Ghost led me amen praise the Lord amen I probably will just climb to tell you exactly who the Holy Ghost is amen and in what form he is Right Now Praise the Lord amen amen amen glory be to his name he says bringing these two thoughts together you'll see it won't just take a Ord AR study and thinking to make this book real so no matter how many quotes you can line up and try to show the people this ties in with this and this types this he says it won't make it real it takes the operation of the Holy ghosten amen hallelujah get into the presence of the Holy Ghost one time amen the whole book will be open wide before your wondering eyes amen light upon light a mighty illumination of Revelation will come upon you and the whole book of Revelation amen from the church ages to the seals from the seals to the trumpets from the trumpets to the vs amen amen yes hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah so it can't take a study like a student he's saying showing you that this is piecing with that this means a book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people amen amen the prophet of of God is saying is revealed to a special class of people and I'm talking to a special class of people this is not an Earthly class this is an Heavenly class amen you are not seated here amen a 10 green manner but you are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus receiving revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah you don't have to get upset with people you know in school if they call you special class put you in special class you should get offended but yeah I'm not off CH to be called a special class amen I'm an not Paul amen call me what you want say what you want I'm special class Lord amen hallelujah thank you Lord amen Amen brother BR says you can't do without the nuts amen how many of you feel like a nut amen I think amen we need some nuts here I I need more nuts than that amen that we got too many bols amen how many of you are nut of God and not ball amen not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ not ashamed to Proclaim amen his name glory glory glory amen soon as I said nuts everyone put their hands down amen hallelujah nobody wants to be a nut everyone wants to be a boat praise the Lord he says if you get rid of the nuts your whole thing will come apart amen amen so call me a n for Christ amen hallelujah call me a nut for Christ and the thing is we are not loose nuts we are not loose nuts we have been tightened by the Holy Ghost because he says remember that cart needs to be packed tightly and sealed by the Holy Ghost so we are not ordinary nuts we are tightened [Music] nuts amen you need the nuts to keep this whole church together you need the not to keep the message together amen everyone can be a boat amen praise the Lord where are we requires amen special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight we've had him it would amen and we are part of that prophetic class it require the ability to hear from God you know in order to hear you need to shut up yes shut in with God in the secret place there in his presence beholding his face gaining the power to run in the R I love to be shut in with God am we think when we shut in with God Lord oh Lord I need this I need this Lord bless me Lord and and Lord I need this father you know I have need of this father if you only give me this Lord sh amen he says sometimes we so much in a hurry to get out of the prayer room we don't give him time to speak speak back to us amen it requires Supernatural oh this is something now that's foreign foreign Supernatural it requires Supernatural instruction not just student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit where it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves and open and become healed to the spirit and year and know as I already said This Book of Revelation is a consummation of scriptures it's even placed exactly right in the cannon of scripture at the End Amen praise the Lord I need to stop reading this quot other words will never end here amen towards the end of that quote he says the revelation of God for each age can come in that age only so I'm saying the revelation of the Bride being the manifested word could only come in this day it couldn't come in Luther couldn't be the manifested the full manifested word for his day he only had one part it's only in this time and season that the full manifestation of the word is on the earth praise the Lord he says we learned this principle immediately revelation of God for each age can come in that age only at a specific time amen the revelation of God to Moses can only come at a specific time of History his as the people cried to God Jesus himself came at the fullness of time he be he being the full revelation of the godhead and this age the revelation of God will come in its due time it will not falter neither will it be premature think on this and eat it well for we are in the end time today amen amen than you Lord so if you're wondering what time we in the prophet is saying he's manifested now in the dispensation of the Holy Ghost I'm going to Define what the Holy Ghost is here very quickly see what the prophet is saying we are not living in the Christian dispensation but in the Holy Ghost dispensation it's the acts of the holy spirit in the church marvelous day we're living in greatest time of all ages we're now living just at the closing of sin this world's activities and fixing to enter into that great age that we've looked for so long the Hebrew prophets had spoke through the day am that's in my angel shall go before thee now in the next paragraph there he going to define the angel he says and that Pillar of Fire or the angel praise the Lord somebody say praise the Lord amen he says so this Pillar of Fire that's over the prophets said amen amen or the angel was the angel of the Covenant everybody get this now I believe all ministers will agree with that that that was the angel of the Covenant if it was the angel of the Covenant then it was the who was it Lord Jesus it was God the who amen thank so who is the angel of God the holy SP spirit in the form of angel of God praise the Lord amen it was the angel of the Covenant then it was the Lord Jesus Christ it was God the holy spirit that was Christ the logos the angel of the Covenant that led the children of Israel out of Egypt to the promised land which was just the foreshadow as he did in the natural then it does in the spiritual today amen amen praise the Lord amen what did he do in the natural day he supplied all their needs their clothes didn't we out in the wilderness he provided food for them he provided clothing for them and my God says in this Third Exodus my God shall supply all your needs according to his witches and glory amen they needed water from The Rock he provided for them they needed food he provided angel food for them whatever they needed amen hallelujah he gave it to them amen thank you Lord and he's our present help in the time of trouble he said in mark 11:24 whatever you ask when you pray believe that you have already received it praise the Lord now just to close on this point the greatest the strongest weapon that they is in all the world that's prayer prayer is what changes things the Christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ I'm getting into the part now you defeat Satan's kingdom yes Amen in order to defeat him on your feet you've got to defeat him on your knees prayer is what changes things the Christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ he doesn't realize what power that is if the people could only realize that what is given unto them anything you ask for will be given if you can appropriate the faith to believe it for God's word is true so what we've got to do to get it back into the program of God and find out after all what God wants us to do and the only way I know to do is it is prayer prayer is the key that's the answer if you want to go somewhere you need a key to start your car if you want to access the kingdom well of prayer is the key what is prayer prayer is petitioning prayer means to petition okay he doesn't realize amen so yeah he saying prayer is the key Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in control of human beings there's no atomic bomb hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God so in a kingdom you can't access the king the only way you can access the king is to petition the king now remember this is not a democracy in the kingdom of God this is a kingdom realm so you've got to petition how do you petition according to what's in the word yes amen you can only make a petition based on the king's law King you said in decree certain certain me that this will happen if I come before you that's how you petition but if we don't know what's in the decree if we don't know what's in the word how do we petition the Lord amen so whatever the king commands becomes law and you can petition the king according to the king's word so prayer is how we petition the king now a prayerless life is telling God Amen you know what a prayerless life is telling God I have pride to live a prayerless life is to live a life of Pride to live a prayerless life is to tell God I am self-sufficient to live a prayerless life is to live in arrogance to live a prayerless life he's saying I don't need God you don't need to contact an high realm I
