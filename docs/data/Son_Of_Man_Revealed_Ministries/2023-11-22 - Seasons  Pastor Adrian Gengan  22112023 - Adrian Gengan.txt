family welcome amen fellowship with Pastor Leon amen Pastor Leon is working he couldn't be a tonight amen so there was a change in schedule many of you wondering why I'm standing here to preach there was a change in schedule amen the brother had to leave back to his country amen so you won't be ministering here tonight but things that are not in our control is in God's control amen so praise the Lord amen so if you were disappointed I mean you were going to come to church anyway amen so praise the Lord let's turn to our Bibles amen I listened to Sunday service tremendously blessed I believe you were blessed as well amen we had a wonderful time with the Believers in momas as well amen hallelujah amen we we can read uh amen let's read Ecclesiastes 3 and verse 1 the Bible says in ecclesiast 3:1 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven amen so there's a season for everything in our lives and a time to every purpose under the heaven amen hallelujah we'll read Daniel 2: 21 as well just a small portion of that scripture Daniel 2: 211 says and he changeth the times and the seasons amen amen so somebody's in control of these things amen hallelujah and then we go to Galatians 6:9 amen Galatians chapter 6 and ver9 let us not grow weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not amen hallelujah that word Fain doesn't mean like faint fall down and because you're weak amen don't have strength it means you must continue in patience amen let us not grow weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap amen if we Fain not one more verse of scripture in Timothy chap 4:2 amen hallelujah 2 Timothy 4:2 says preach the word be instant in season and out of season amen amen so the preacher got to be season always and then when things get out of season he's got to be able to step into out of season as well reprove rebuke exalt with all love longsuffering and Doctrine amen the Lord had blessings with the reading of his word you may be seated amen hallelujah amen we'll just title the seasons hallelujah amen so we are thankful to the Lord amen that he's able to reveal himself to us we know we are living in a time in a season that is called hours time amen ours Time season is different to the start of the season when they sewing that's right amen hallelujah there's a different group of people on the field at our time than those that were sewing amen hallelujah there's a different amen function for the people that were sewing and there's a different function for the people that are reaping now so we we find that there are constant references in the Bible to Seasons and our lives the prophet will say as different seasons and Cycles amen hallelujah if I can read a quote in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ in paragraph 55 brother Bram says we are families every family in here is customed to that sometimes everything will run fine for you for years then all at once you hit a spell where everything goes wrong right we say it many times in the South year when it rains it pours and you're going through a night time then there's a day break then a night time everything runs in continuity amen so we find that our lives will have seasons if we if we cast our memory back to our own lives we will see that there's been seasons of highs seasons of lows if you have to look in your spiritual life you'll also see that sometimes you walking in spiritual lights but if you can also find the low seasons in your life I want you to know the low seasons in your life was because you allowed yourself to get there it was not God's will for you to be there amen amen and if you can hear the theme of the services that are coming out it was because of the lack of consecration amen because that's what's require Reed submission to the holy spirit amen but we get so comfortable and over the years as time has transpired we got so comfortable with the message of the hour and we got comfortable thinking that we are safe just by saying that we believe the message of the hour not realizing that a consecrated life is what is required for the Holy Ghost to have the preeminence amen amen so life will have seasons now if we look at the life of Joseph we'll see Jose Joseph's lives can be typed out in Seasons we can say like four seasons amen hallelujah hallelujah he's the favorite of his father that's one season of his life then he's a prisoner amen sorry not a prisoner then he's a servant in part of his house so from the favorite in his father's house he goes to being a servant then he becomes a prisoner and then he becomes we call him the king of the country right because the king didn't do anything he left everything in charge of Joseph in charge of everything now watch something here The Four Seasons are marked by four garments in his father's house he had a court of Many Colors amen hallelujah his father favored him in that season now you notice something there God gives him a vision or a dream in that season of his life and he's not showing him his journey through life yeah but God is showing him the end result amen and he's showing him in the form of a dream that how everybody is coming to bow on before him so that's the vision you must hold before him amen he can't be deterred by any other thing that happens in his life and as soon as he reveals the dream to his father and to his brothers jealousy arises amen hallelujah so we find the season moves very quickly and it your season in your life that you're going through can move people to jealousy to bitterness to Envy amen just because you are walking in your season doesn't mean everybody else is going to applaud you amen but God is testing our character God is testing us and taking us through these trials to show you that I am walking with you and you don't have to rely on anybody else and even when things go downhill and they throw you into a pit know that I will never leave you nor will I forsake you amen through the changing season maybe it's springtime and you can see the season changing amen hallelujah I want you you know the Bible says maybe one of you can find the scripture just coming to mind now that God will not give you more than you can handle but with the Temptation he will provide a way of Escape for you amen amen hallelujah so imagine now you get a dream like this and with very spiritual people around if the if things don't transpire in your life according to the dream what do they label you as false you just had a dream that we buy down before you yes look at what you we done now we we sold you to slavery yes what were they doing they removed one garment his coat of many kind and what was he doing it was a type of Christ Christ was removing his Heavenly garment amen a seven color rainbow garment amen amen hallelujah what was he going to do he was going to move into the next season of his ministry of servanthood Christ was going to become a servant so Joseph's life was typ in Christ so they removed one garment and they give him a garment of a servant amen so no longer now he has memories of his father's house and he has memories of his father's garments and you find the in that transition got to try and get away from this now this thing is making my voice horse amen hallelujah but I I don't want to turn that off for you because it's going to turn off very soon amen but I can feel my the season of my throat is changing amen hallelujah but it's fine we shall endure amen the brothers were supposed to be at shim s amen you can find it there the father told him that they were there why that place is important it was the first meeting place between God and Abraham and God and Abraham had built God an altar there so it's entire type showing you that the brothers were supposed to be in one position but they had left that place and Joseph meets somebody there who tells him your brothers are no longer here they have gone to Dothan and Dothan means double well so you can see they left the one true God and they went after two Wells amen they went after more Waters they went after more light they went after a trinity Doctrine you can say amen so they left the original place of meeting where God met Abraham and they were gone out of the God's provided place of worship yes amen hallelujah amen so they go to Dothan and it's in between this thing they atch out a plan to kill not well they wanted to kill him but then you know Reuben steps in and says don't kill him amen and then they sold him to Slaves so it's in this thing they they take the coat and they put animal Blood on the coat now watch something they deceive their father who is their father amen many of you are saying it right it's one man with two names some are saying Jacob some are saying Israel and is Jacob deceived into thinking that is this is Joseph's blood it was the coat remember the coat was right but the blood was wrong amen hallelujah but wasn't he the one that deceived his father with what he put a garment of right what am I trying to show you gar changing of garments represent changing of Seasons because when he put that garment to show his father that he was Esau it was going to change their season of their lives he had to flee and Esau season changed he was no longer at the birthright in the family Esau season changed when Jacob put on a garment of a sheep or whatever skin it was you get what I'm trying to say a garment represents change what did they try and do in Eden they tried to put on a garment yes it was changing of season amen [Music] hallelujah so we find here he takes they strip him off this seven colored robe and they put on a servant Rob Christ putting on the form of a servant they put him in part of his house and he becomes the chief of all servants but his his is is uh Destiny ation is not to be the chief of all servants in the father's house Christ's destination was not to be the master of all men here on Earth in a flesh body he had to move Amen to souls that were in prison he had to go to a grave beyond the grave Ministry amen so Joseph couldn't stay there because he was typing Christ he couldn't stay in the role of servanthood even though he was excelling at it wasn't Jesus excelling at his uh task of being the Redeemer on Earth amen he was the master of all circumstance he was the god man they didn't know what to do with Jesus am amen he was excelling just like Joseph was excelling and then we find that now what happens watch the Garment again he's now got a prisoners garment but somebody strips him off that garment part of his wife and does that change his season it changes the season because they now move him from part of his house into the prison house and do he get new clothes in the prison house he gets prisoners clothes amen hallelujah changing of garments so he's moving amen hallelujah Christ moved from that veil of Flesh amen and he went back amen the body lay in the grave and he moved into his theophonic body and he went to preach to souls that were in prison amen amen a changing of season but he wasn't only going to preach to souls that were in prison he was going to take back the keys of death of hell and the grave amen hallelujah but he was positionally placed there because he was going to move from the lowest of the palace the lowest of all places death he would have died there amen if it had not been for the Butler and the baker amen hallelujah but God had positioned him there for his specific purpose and he excelled even in there and they made him the Lord of all the prisoners amen Hal ujah amen you know Jesus Christ reconciled something that had never been done before let me tell you what this is when God made man he said I'll be God of the heavens you be God on the earth I'll make you an amateure God he says You must have dominion over the Earth man but Jesus Christ amen so if God wanted to do anything on the earth he has to work by a man yes that's why the Holy Spirit can only work in cooperation with man who submit themselves to him amen amen hallelujah so we find here Jesus Christ changed everything because the Bible says amen that all power is given unto this man Jesus Christ in heaven and on earth now there's a man who can control Heaven and Earth am Jesus just switched it up am amen hallelujah there's a man now who has control over the heavens and the Earth amen hallelujah maybe you didn't Rejoice too much about that but I want you to know that you are join ears with Jesus Christ I want you to know that Jesus also said whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you lose on Earth shall be Loos in heaven amen he came to unlock keys so that you can operate not only that amen if he's made you the married wife if he's told you you that overcome on the earth if you overcome this latest here in church is even as I overcame and I'm sat down in my father's Throne so if you overcome you can sit with me on my Throne amen let me tell you a queen can also operate in her Authority amen like Queen Esther amen but you need to know that you are the Queen of Heaven am hallelujah amen amen so what did it it took Jesus death his burial and his resurrection because when he rose again he rose triumphant he says all power in heaven and on Earth is given unto me now nothing can be done in heaven nothing can be done on Earth without Jesus Christ he's the king of kings he's the Lord of lords amen he's the Prince of Peace he's the Mighty God he's the mighty conqueror Lord amen what a majestic Lord Jesus Christ we serve amen he's the same yesterday today and forever he is unchanging in his ways amen hallelujah so now the part of his wife stripped him of his servant robe and she used the Rob to accuse him bring an accusation and change the season in his life so that he can move to the next point of his ministry what am I trying to show you watch the seasons in your life God has it there for a purpose amen hallelujah but it's important for you not to get stuck in one season amen hallelujah when when God is moving you from one season to the next even though it might seem like it's a harder season I mean from being a servant he went to the prison house I want you to know that it's in your darkest Seasons that the presence of God is the strongest he said I will never leave you nor forsake you in the darkest of hours the light shines brightest amen hallelujah amen you know when Joseph was there wearing this robe of many colors in his father's house amen maybe you couldn't sense the presence of God there but when you're walking through even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil thy rod and thy staff they comfort me amen hallelujah so watch your changing season amen hallelujah don't get too comfortable in your season because remember you are moving into a season from mortality to immortality there's a goal here Church there's there's a goal here people of God Amen God has a vision in mind and he's moving you from mortality to immortality doesn't the Apostle Paul talk about changing of garments laying aside this robe of Flesh Amen to put on an immortal garment he wants to change us from a season of mortality to a season of immortality thank you amen God is working with us God is moving us positioning us oh but oh I know it's easy to get Earth bound amen I know it's easy Amen to get comfortable with life to think that this is it I've arrived I've achieved no we haven't achieved we haven't arrived amen God is still fixing to do something in your life amen God is still fixing amen if you can only surrender to the Holy Spirit if you can only get consecrate your life to the Lord allow him to have that work amen praise the Lord glory be to his name amen amen while I'm there just thought of this quote amen if I can just find it quickly for you amen then we can read it amen if you can find the unfailing realities of the Living God Amen if if if we can understand what the prophet of God is telling us here now you got the message amen amen if you can just search that message alone where he says how we've deprived ourselves amen we've deprived ourselves now how many if you think if I say we deprived ourselves we'll all agree right if I say that we can rob God how many of you will agree amen yeah I I know where you are thinking now you are thinking of scripture where have we rob Thee the Bible says in tithes and in offering right but that's not what I'm talking about even though you should be paying your tithes and your offering but that's not where my focus is here what the prophet of God is saying I often thought now let let's pay attention to this it's Deep Thoughts I've often thought how we've deprived ourselves how we've robbed God of his plan how did we rob you Lord by not surrendering Our Lives completely to him yes everything that we have to him how that we have disallowed his program now that's an indictment we have disallowed his program how we've lingered and have made into way wait and wait and wait trying to find somebody that he can work through oh how many if you want to say Lord I I want to surrender amen you know you know sometimes we lie the most to our songs because it's easy Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul relying it's just a song We singing with no meaning amen I surrender all but you don't want to surrender your Z but he says here we made him wait and wait trying to find somebody that he could walk through trying to find a man somewhere that he could put confidence in some man that would surrender everything oh when I read this quote I said Lord I want to be that man how many if you feel that way you want to be that sister you want to be that brother that surrenders everything now I tell you if we really come sincerely tonight I believe the Lord can work through [Music] US amen amen look at how we can rob the Lord look at how we can stop his program disallow his program how we've lingered made him wait why because of our stubbornness amen if we can find the resurrection of J's daughter amen the resurrection of J's [Music] daughter amen that's not me sick that's the petrol smell amen hallelujah if you get it just tell me 5403 31 and if you can search there a man completely surrendered amen why am I highlighting this this is the key if you want to know the key to the power of God this is it amen let's read it from there now if a person now put your name there completely surrendered to the devil will give him twice his strength you know many times you were testimonies of this you see demon powers and the spirit of God can only work with men who submit themselves have you ever seen the Holy Spirit overpower you and force you to use your body what does he always tell us the holy spirit is in same with demon powers you say I got possessed with the demon power you know what allow him in yes am amen instead of singing Have Thine Own Way Lord you are saying have thine own way with me devil have thine own way I love to watch my movies I can be your clay mold me and shape me after Netflix mold me and shake me me after bber mold me and shape me after Beckham mold me and shape me make me a messy mold me and shape me Ronaldo me amen hallelujah amen but a person maybe I remember the testimony brother Joshua telling about the strength of this man that they were facing then the prophet also tell us about the man that came there on the stage to challenge him he says the devil will give him twice his strength when a man he says what will a man completely surrender to God do See it'll make you so weak maybe you're crippled and can't stand up but surrender yourself to God and New Life a new strength comes in and you go walking away I seen little people when their little limbs wasn't odly that big grown men and women eaten with cancer rise to the floor that hadn't stood up for months so weak they couldn't have stood up any other way but under the power of God and get up and walk around through the house praising God and get well amen what is it fully surrender to God that's what it takes a complete surrender fully surrender you mean I didn't read this person was doing anything there like very spiritual but he was surrendered amen so you mean if I get surrendered I can get my healing yes that's what this quote is telling you he says the person is getting around the house and he's changing the season what is he doing put Isaiah 61 there check changing the season we're talking about garments you can change the season amen hallelujah praise the Lord Amen brother Caleb if you're going to switch that generator on I want you to do it early we don't have to wait for escom to Lo at us we can switch as soon as amen let's connect the plug and everything then we just switch now amen so we know this is the first part of Jesus prophecy the spirit of the Lord is upon me that's what he fulfilled in his Earthly Ministry then he stopped let's go to the next verse amen verse three this is the part he would come and do in the second part of his ministry it says to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning amen and here's it the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness so who must change a garment how can you change your situation how did Paul and Silas change their situation in the prison they put on the Garment of Praise we can walk around defeated we can walk around telling everyone our problem amen matter of fact if we were sitting in prison today we would be allowed s phones and if your name was Paul and Silas you probably be texting people you probably be phoning them and telling them how you got whipped and beaten in the prison amen you probably will be sending them a message pray for me amen but Paul and Silas decided to change their garment amen amen they were there sitting there with the spirit of heaviness they were sitting there amen beaten but they changed their praise hallelujah amen they changed their praise they changed their garment I asked you Amen to switch it up hey see us right on time there who could have time there I said I ask you to switch it up and then it goes off [Music] amen amen I ask you to change your season amen how you got to open your mouth and change your season that's right the power lies in your mouth amen change your season stop telling everyone how bad it is tell them how good it is amen let them tell you what are you talking about you can't even walk you crippled here tell them I can walk maybe you can't see it but I'm running through fields of green amen tell them You See Fields of green red roses too amen hallelujah amen amen because you have eyesight that they can't see we don't see with natural eyes amen hallelujah so yeah was they changing His Garment what were they doing moving every time they change His Garment they were moving Joseph to the next stage of his ministry yes amen amen I tell you you on your final change of your garment oh yes hallelujah amen hallelujah we are on the final change right now amen hallelujah yes so yeah was amen part of his wife took His Garment off because amen he didn't need that garment anymore he was moving to the next phase of his ministry he needed to move down to the prison because in the prison amen he was going to move amen get the keys of death hell and the grave and he was going to move all the way up and what garment did he get next he got the king's own garment who gave us the Garment in Revelation chapter 19 amen amen hallelujah to her was given a garment a fine linen yes amen who's been given that garment the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen who gave us that garment I gave him my old Ted garment amen he gave me a robe of pure white I'm feasting on Mana from Heaven that's why I'm happy today amen hallelujah how many of you believe the windows of Heaven are open amen Amen Let It Rain Lord amen I see your season change amen I see you amen because you are highly revelated people amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen we were reading there maybe we'll read the scripture now Daniel chapter 2 two amen I want to show you something here that what class of people you are and we were reading verse 21 that's where we read right genes Daniel 2: 211 amen he changed the times and season he removeth Kings seted up Kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that they know understanding let's read the next verse he reveal the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the Darkness Ness and the light dwelleth with him can we say the light dwells with us you are the light of the world this is the verse 23 I thank thee watch how he switches it now now it's going to praise I thank thee and praise thee oh now you need to get Revelation here now I can't give it all to you you need to catch your Revelation amen amen you can see the verse the Thing and everything is there I thank thee and praise thee all th God of my fathers have our faith been returned back to the god of our fathers who has given me wisdom and might and has made known unto me now what we desire of thee for thou has now made known unto us the king's matter as the back part of God's mind been revealed to us as the king's matter been revealed to us is Christ The Mystery of God been revealed to us the hidden Mystery was that was in the back part of God's mind you are I ask you why is he sh in this verse the king's mat has been revealed to usall and what is here the Garment of Praise amen I thank thee and praise thee that thou has revealed your mind to me the bright is the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with the word amen amen God not only take Joseph out of the prison house and he gave him amen the king's robe he also gave him the king's ring and he gave him the king's scepter he gave him the king's boss he gave him the king's Chariot and he says only you alone amen hallelujah yes will be second to me amen every other person in this Kingdom must bow down to you he says when they say blow the trumpet Joseph is coming every knee must bow whether it be my own children amen whether it be Pharaoh's children whether it be Pharaoh's nephews whether it be Pharaoh's nieces they can be Pharaoh's sisters can be Pharaoh's brothers when they hear the name of Joseph being announced amen every knee must bow every tongue must confess amen hallelujah the season has changed for us we're coming now to the closing season of the Gentiles I ask you are you walking worthy of the season I ask you are you walking in complete surrender to him amen amen I I tell you that the Lord can do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think in our lives right now am the problem we know it's a lack of surrender you see when we leave here now we go back to the norm we go back to just what we know amen how I can make the next 10 R make the next 20 R how I'm going to make the next 30 R amen I'm going to make the next 40 Rand I'm going to make the next 50 Rand amen hallelujah how I'm going to pay the rent let me declare to you if you want to live in the economy of South Africa it's fine that's right but there's an economy within an economy you see in our world the South African economy may be the greatest thing on our mind how to exist within the South African economy and how whether I exist in the lower income the middle class or the upper class but you know there's an economy within economy you see the South African economy is trying to cope with the American economy every economy is trying to cope with one another but I want you to know all of the economies of the world are existing within the greater economy of God's economy amen who sets up kingdoms who brings them down amen let me show you something when Elijah said there shall not be rain for 3 and 1 half years unless I call for it what happened there he changed times and season yes amen God kept him there by the Brook and he was being fed yes God could have kept him in that season but what how God moved him out of that season because when he arrives to This Woman's house she was on her last meal and oil I'm telling you God could have kept him there and continue to provide for him for that time and period but a woman was in need now the economy of Israel was failing whether she worked or not she wouldn't have been able to buy meal because there was no meal there was no oil to buy amen so what did she tell him we are going to eat this thing and we are going to die how many of you have ever come into that point in your life where you knew it was your last meal and after that you were dead so none of us have been put in that position amen hallelujah but I want you to see something at that point when all hope was gone God's economy came into effect I don't think you understand what I'm saying whether the South African economy fails or not whether the Israel economy failed on that day or not in God's economy the cruise of oil and the barrel of meal never ran down God can make you prosper in his economy even though economies around you are falling but it depends on what economy you want to choose to dwell in you see you can choose to dwell in the economy of your bank balance and that can really make you sad can really make you depressed because you're operating by what you see but I'm if you know that we've been telling you that Faith looks to the Unseen amen hallelujah amen sometimes you need to get bloody vision now when you see that bank Ballance you must see more and more zeros appearing there amen hallelujah amen amen stop telling people that you are broke right stop telling people that you are making ends meat amen because I I tell you the truth that the the problem is the situation you find yourself in right now the current living situation circum sense whatever it is is because of your confession you've confessed it right how things hey just barely making ends me have to pay the bills how's the job hey make you know just enough to pay the rent just enough to pay the lights you know I challenge you to come into God's economy and you'll rid yourself of credit cards yeah yeah only two people said amen amen I want more people to connect you see your credit card debt you don't have to live with that right because that's borrowed money you see your loans now I need people who really believe me you now amen that you serve a God who owns a cattle on a th000 heels and he's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ask or think you think if you can speak for your healing you can't speak for other things amen hallelujah am what's going to happen in the time of the squeeze amen say Lord now I feel squeezed the banks every month they coming and asking me for interest I want to cancel all loans yeah yeah some one or two are still catching what I'm saying that's right I want you to look at your debt and I want you to speak to your debt and I want you to speak to The God Who is Jehovah Gyra and ask him Amen to remove all debt from your life am Amen Hallelujah by the end of what I saying which is in the next minute or two I want all of you to declare that you are debt free amen amen amen and you got to believe it in your and confess with your this is a world taught class you see we're coming to the end of the year report cards are coming out so you well he amen praise the Lord amen we can't just leave it to Healing Faith doesn't operate in one level only you can take Faith and apply it into all areas whatsoever you say Amen faith is a substance of things hope for well brother I only got spiritual things in my hope chest and that's your thing amen my father put me on a natural Earth yes and he told me to multiply and replenish the Earth amen amen he told me that he said have dominion over the earth now here on the earth why you allowing that situation to have
