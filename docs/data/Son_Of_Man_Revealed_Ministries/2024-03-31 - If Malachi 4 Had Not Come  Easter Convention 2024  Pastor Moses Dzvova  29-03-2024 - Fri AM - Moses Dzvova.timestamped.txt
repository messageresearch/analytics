[56:39] love Pastor
[56:41] Adrien and I want to salute all the
[56:44] pastors the Servants of the Lord that

[56:50] also want to salute our Elder Pastor
[56:53] Nami how many love Pastor Nami
[57:00] there is a humous brother amen he will
[57:04] make you feel comfortable so Pastor
[57:08] n and Pastor Robert benam they received
[57:14] me yesterday at the king Shaka
[57:17] International Airport amen and they
[57:20] treated me well may God bless you men of
[57:24] God Amen
[57:30] so you know there's something about
[57:33] South Africa you know my great
[57:36] grandfather my great
[57:39] grandmother came from
[57:41] transar she was called
[57:44] Mah you know she was light complexion
[57:48] and F you know that are women so and she
[57:54] gave my mother a
[57:56] name my mother had a name by the name
[58:05] [Music]
[58:07] of Amen so I really appreciate she was
[58:11] very tough amen so I appreciate Pastor M
[58:17] and you know there's something about de
[58:19] the angel of the Lord said go to
[58:22] De it was the climax of The Prophet
[58:26] visit to South Africa
[58:29] amen so I always say when time is
[58:33] prolonged corruption will set
[58:36] in so I don't want to take much time
[58:39] because when Moses delayed to come from
[58:42] the mountain corruption
[58:45] set it was
[58:47] idolatry because time it
[58:50] prolonged and I also want to say to the
[58:52] young people don't stay in courtship for
[58:55] a long time
[58:56] corruption might set in you might forget
[58:59] that you are not yet
[59:02] wored even when Samson delayed to take
[59:04] his wife corruption set in his wife was
[59:08] given to his best friend because time it
[59:12] prolonged you remember even Paul when he
[59:15] preached all night corruption set
[59:18] in fell and died because the message had
[59:24] prolonged so the B says those days will
[59:28] be shortened for the sake of the
[59:31] elect Hallelujah if those dayses were
[59:34] not shortened no soul was going to be
[59:37] saved so this morning the Simon will be
[59:41] short for the sake of the elect amen do
[59:46] you love
[59:48] him can you say hallelujah hallelujah
[59:51] can you say hallelujah hallelujah you
[59:55] know that's 50 % can you say hallelujah
[59:59] hallelujah 70% can you say hallelujah
[1:00:04] hallelujah
[1:00:06] 99.9% can you say hallelujah
[1:00:09] hallelujah that's more like it now
[1:00:12] because when they shouted the walls of
[1:00:15] Jero fell down
[1:00:18] Hallelujah so without wasting much time
[1:00:21] fearing corruption let's stand upon our
[1:00:24] feet let's stand upon on our feet God
[1:00:26] bless you church amen we thank God for a
[1:00:30] wonderful weather I was told de is hot
[1:00:36] actually everything is hot in

[1:00:43] weather is hot everything is hot but God
[1:00:47] has been kind to us am for the where you
[1:00:50] know I was telling the pastors hey we
[1:00:53] thank God so Revelation ch 10 you know
[1:00:57] our familiar scripture Revelation
[1:01:01] 10 ver 7 God bless you Pastor name
[1:01:05] Hallelujah Revelation 10 verse 7 it's a
[1:01:10] familiar one the Bible says but in the
[1:01:13] days of the voice of the seven Angel
[1:01:17] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:01:22] of God you know I like that I like the
[1:01:24] Bible it not say the
[1:01:27] Mysteries it says the mystery of
[1:01:31] God there is only one mystery not
[1:01:35] Mysteries what is that mystery Christ is
[1:01:39] the mystery of God
[1:01:42] reveal
[1:01:43] Hallelujah Christ is the mystery of God
[1:01:47] revealed in the days of the voice of the
[1:01:50] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:01:52] sound the mystery of God should be f
[1:01:55] finished as he declared to his servants
[1:01:58] the prophets we may be seated may God
[1:02:02] His blessings to the reading of the word

[1:02:59] 64079 M paragraph
[1:03:02] 243 the prophet says the Holy Spirit has
[1:03:06] been bound by these denominational
[1:03:09] Rivers for almost 2,000 years but is to
[1:03:14] be loed in the evening time how many
[1:03:17] believe in the evening time this Holy
[1:03:20] Ghost which was bound is to be loosed in
[1:03:24] this evening time
[1:03:26] by the evening time message the Holy
[1:03:29] Spirit back in the church again Christ
[1:03:34] himself revealed in human flesh
[1:03:38] Hall in the evening time he said he
[1:03:42] promised it so do you see that this Holy
[1:03:45] Ghost which was bound is to be released
[1:03:49] in this evening time so we thank God if
[1:03:53] Malachi 4 did not come how many can say
[1:03:56] Amen so we thank God for Malachi 4 we
[1:04:00] had to come with a message that was
[1:04:03] going to release Hallelujah the Holy
[1:04:06] Ghost amen do you love him in another
[1:04:11] quotation I'll just quot it brother says
[1:04:15] you know I don't care how many names
[1:04:18] your book how many books your name is on
[1:04:22] but if the genuine Holy Ghost is in you
[1:04:27] which is this word
[1:04:31] manifested you will see the message into
[1:04:34] the
[1:04:35] hour hallelujah what is the Holy Ghost
[1:04:39] this word
[1:04:41] manifested and the real Holy Ghost will
[1:04:45] lead you to the message of the
[1:04:47] hour what is the sign that you have
[1:04:50] received the Holy Ghost a genuine faith
[1:04:53] in the promised word of God power that's
[1:04:57] a sign that you have received the Holy
[1:04:59] Ghost how many can say
[1:05:01] amen I I just want to to to say this
[1:05:04] again in the message this day this
[1:05:07] scripture is fulfilled Hallelujah
[1:05:13] 6529 paragraph 146 listen to this what
[1:05:17] is the Holy Ghost brother Bram says the
[1:05:20] Holy Ghost is the word of God in you do
[1:05:25] you what is saying the Holy Ghost is the
[1:05:29] word of God in you that
[1:05:33] identifies Itself by accepting that word
[1:05:38] what is the Holy Ghost is the word of
[1:05:41] God in you that identifies Itself by
[1:05:46] accepting this word so if you have got a
[1:05:49] holy ghost you will punctuate every word
[1:05:52] of God with an amen how many can say
[1:05:57] Amen praise be to God Hallelujah the
[1:06:01] Holy Ghost is the word of God in you
[1:06:04] that identifies Itself by
[1:06:06] accepting that word outside of that it
[1:06:10] can be the Holy Ghost if it says it's
[1:06:13] the Holy Spirit and denies one word of
[1:06:16] the Bible it cannot be the Holy Spirit
[1:06:19] that's the evidence whether you believe
[1:06:22] or not how many can say amen amen
[1:06:25] accepting the word that's why in another
[1:06:28] quotation he says wait until the seven
[1:06:32] thers your voices to that group that can
[1:06:37] accept the word how many say Amen praise
[1:06:41] be to God are you

[1:26:37] that is preaching it says it's easy to
[1:26:41] believe an angel it's easy to believe

[1:26:48] to believe another man you believe
[1:26:52] it was told the people to believe you
[1:26:57] how say Amen the reason why some things

[1:27:04] that we don't believe the men of God our
[1:27:08] pastors is we are supposed to do that if
[1:27:11] you see the
[1:27:13] Pentecostals things are happening they
[1:27:16] believe they are prophets if you believe
[1:27:20] Pastor if you believe Pastor K if you
[1:27:23] believe pastor
[1:27:24] things will happen do you believe it and
[1:27:28] I believe you believe me tonight the
[1:27:31] Bible says that government shall be upon
