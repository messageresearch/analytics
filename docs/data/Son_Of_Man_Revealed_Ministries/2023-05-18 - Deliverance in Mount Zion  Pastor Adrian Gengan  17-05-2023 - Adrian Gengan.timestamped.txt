[4:02] Jesus Christ amen good to see every one
[4:05] of you in the name of the Lord amen I
[4:07] believe tonight we're going to have a
[4:09] great victory in the house of the Lord I
[4:12] believe we have a winning team amen you
[4:14] know when the coach is confident about
[4:16] the team
[4:17] he puts them against better competition
[4:20] amen and I'm confident about our team
[4:24] because the Lord is being doing a work
[4:26] for us amen the Lord has been we've been
[4:29] consecrating our life to him amen and
[4:31] we've been surrendering Our Lives to him
[4:34] and I believe the Lord wants to take us
[4:35] another stage in the journey and another
[4:37] step in the journey under the third pool
[4:39] Ministry because one of the polls is
[4:41] speaking to the Lost yes amen preaching
[4:45] to the lost so you'll find a lot of time
[4:47] people's Deliverance
[4:50] and their victory
[4:52] is going to rely on us
[4:55] and how consecrated we are
[4:58] amen and how dedicated we are in this
[5:00] hour right
[5:01] amen hallelujah we'll speak for a little
[5:04] thought amen I haven't said that amen
[5:06] just for I I really said that an
[5:08] inspiration I believe we have winning
[5:09] team amen amen amen hallelujah amen how
[5:14] many of you are ready to whoop the devil
[5:16] amen amen thank God for the songs of the
[5:18] song Amen one of The Inspirations so
[5:20] Deliverance the prophet says is the
[5:23] Earthly number tied to four so
[5:26] Deliverance is for the Earth and it's
[5:28] for the people of the Earth
[5:30] amen and if you notice when I wrote that
[5:32] song these three stages I wrote that
[5:35] verse of that song these three stages
[5:37] are changing me into the fourth stage
[5:39] which is the formed word image amen of
[5:42] the Son of God because brother Branham
[5:44] says there were four stages of the rider
[5:48] you remember he ate the bark he ate you
[5:49] know those the restoration of the Bright
[5:51] Tree how he ate the tree yes the
[5:54] caterpillar canker warm Palmer worm
[5:55] Locus he says the same way he rebuilds
[5:58] the church in four stages now we can't
[6:01] stop short at baptism of the Holy Ghost
[6:04] because those are only three stages
[6:06] justification sanctification baptism of
[6:09] the Holy Ghost he says we're going to
[6:11] come to the fourth part which is coming
[6:13] to his image coming to his likeness and
[6:15] I like brother Sony's prayer because
[6:17] amen people are catching the revelation
[6:19] we are Kings and Priests that's the
[6:20] image
[6:22] he's King and his priest he's the high
[6:24] priest
[6:25] and he's King and that's the image we
[6:28] are coming back to if he is there in
[6:30] heaven and he's the head the bride is
[6:32] dead on the earth amen amen and I said
[6:36] this before but I want to reiterate this
[6:37] in order for us to walk in in our kingly
[6:39] Authority it rests in our priesthood in
[6:43] our service and our submission to the
[6:44] Lord amen let's read Joe chapter 2 and
[6:47] verse 32.
[6:49] we'll see here amen with the Lord will
[6:51] revealed to us
[6:52] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[6:55] shall call in the name of the Lord shall
[6:57] be delivered
[6:59] where is Deliverance coming from
[7:01] for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall
[7:06] be Deliverance
[7:08] amen not in a lodge
[7:11] it's coming from a people
[7:14] now it's a revelation who Mount Zion is
[7:16] amen amen Mount Zion is the Bride of
[7:19] Jesus Christ called the sides of the
[7:21] north amen there's a there's a natural
[7:24] Jerusalem and there's a spiritual
[7:26] Jerusalem so he says in Mount Zion and
[7:29] in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the
[7:32] Lord had said and in the remnant whom
[7:35] the Lord shall call
[7:38] amen
[7:39] and in Obadiah 117 I don't know anything
[7:44] about preaches out of Obadiah but he has
[7:47] a nugget here but upon Mount Zion shall
[7:50] be Deliverance
[7:52] and now watch preached again and there
[7:54] shall be
[7:56] holiness
[7:58] and the house of Jacob which is Israel
[8:00] shall possess their possessions amen we
[8:03] shall not live beneath our privileges we
[8:06] shall possess our possession yes Lord
[8:08] we'll be in the land and claim all the
[8:10] land amen thank you Lord that blessings
[8:12] to the reading of his word you may be
[8:14] seated amen hallelujah if you don't play
[8:17] with this bride not in this time not in
[8:19] this hour
[8:20] amen hallelujah we are taking back
[8:23] everything as ours
[8:25] amen we are not living
[8:27] Beyond
[8:28] amen we even taking the bones of Joseph
[8:31] yes
[8:34] because there's no Resurrection in Egypt
[8:36] yes
[8:38] for the federal revelation
[8:40] there's no Resurrection in Egypt
[8:43] amen so we find we're living in the time
[8:47] of the fourth living creature
[8:51] the flying eagle
[8:52] with soaring in Revelation
[8:55] nothing can touch us
[8:58] amen no chicken no Oak no vulture can
[9:03] fly where we fly yes amen amen so the
[9:06] prophet says four is the number of the
[9:07] earth and it means Deliverance
[9:10] amen hallelujah I just want to tie a few
[9:13] things here and show you that in Esther
[9:15] chapter 4 Deliverance comes to the Jews
[9:19] hmm
[9:20] but it comes from a particular woman
[9:22] who's Queen
[9:24] she's in a position of authority
[9:26] now remember we said four so s to four
[9:29] is typing the Deliverance coming to the
[9:31] Jews but she's got to step into that
[9:33] position of being the deliverer
[9:36] you remember Mordecai comes to her and
[9:39] he tells her maybe you were put into the
[9:41] kingdom for such a time as this
[9:44] amen and then you find she goes into a
[9:47] time of consecration
[9:49] if you go to the end of uh Esther
[9:51] chapter four you'll find it there she
[9:54] tells Mordecai go fast three days
[9:59] don't eat
[10:00] because I'm gonna fast
[10:02] amen
[10:04] so we find S to 4
[10:06] biblical number shows you Deliverance is
[10:09] coming to the Jews
[10:11] isn't it also true that in John chapter
[10:13] 4
[10:14] Deliverance comes to the woman at the
[10:16] well
[10:18] she's trapped by bondage
[10:20] by six men
[10:23] she's tied to those men
[10:25] because Jesus being a prophet deserves
[10:27] and said you had five husbands and the
[10:29] one you're living with now is not even
[10:32] your husband
[10:33] amen six a number of the men had abound
[10:38] six Church ages amen amen but yes the
[10:41] seventh the manifested word standing in
[10:43] front of her and he is bringing
[10:45] Deliverance to her yes amen she runs
[10:47] back to the city and says come see a man
[10:50] that told me things I have done she was
[10:53] completely delivered amen and how many
[10:56] times does the prophet use John chapter
[10:57] 4 the woman at the well
[11:00] amen isn't it also true that in Malachi
[11:03] chapter 4
[11:05] amen Elijah the prophet is coming and
[11:08] he's sent to a people to deliver them
[11:10] and turn their hearts back to the faith
[11:13] of the fathers amen has that already
[11:15] happened amen amen it's already happened
[11:18] our hearts have already been turned back
[11:21] amen
[11:23] and isn't it also true that in first
[11:25] Thessalonians chapter 4. amen
[11:27] amen Deliverance is coming to a people
[11:30] amen Deliverance is going to come not
[11:33] only to the sleeping Saints amen but
[11:35] it's our final deliverance from Mortal
[11:38] bodies to Immortal glorified bodies
[11:41] amen
[11:45] one more and isn't it also true that in
[11:47] Revelation 4.
[11:51] John is caught up and is delivered from
[11:54] time into eternity and he's asked to
[11:57] come up a little higher amen and his
[11:59] Revelation explodes he goes from partial
[12:02] revelation of who God is and he goes
[12:04] into the throne room and he sees one
[12:07] sitting on the throne boy is the number
[12:09] of Deliverance amen
[12:13] amen hallelujah
[12:15] amen hallelujah so God promises
[12:20] Abraham that is seed is going through
[12:22] sojourn for how many years
[12:25] 400 years
[12:27] Deliverance is coming yes 400 years
[12:31] amen hallelujah
[12:34] and Moses was a fulfillment of that
[12:37] promise
[12:38] amen then when
[12:40] God brought Moses on the scene and he
[12:43] took them out of Egypt how many decades
[12:46] had they had to wait before they entered
[12:47] the Promised Land
[12:49] 40 years is how many decades
[12:51] four decades
[12:53] deliberate is coming to the children who
[12:55] are in the wilderness after four decades
[13:00] amen
[13:01] so yeah we are under we've had them
[13:04] they're lying we had the ox we had the
[13:07] man but now we're in the age of the
[13:10] Flying Eagle amen under the fourth
[13:12] anointing is coming and deliverance to
[13:14] the people
[13:15] amen a Deliverance to the earth a
[13:19] Deliverance to the church to Fly Above
[13:21] Mammy Creeds man-made dogmas man-made
[13:25] systems and so into spiritual Revelation
[13:27] amen
[13:31] [Music]
[13:32] back in the day of Daniel you find that
[13:35] there was three anointings
[13:38] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego typing the
[13:41] lion the ox and the man
[13:44] but there was a fourth anointing there
[13:47] Daniel was the eagle
[13:49] amen Dan is the symbol was the eagle
[13:53] amen and he was flying through Babylon
[13:56] amen amen
[13:59] and isn't it true that there Shadrach
[14:01] Meshach and abedin go three men stepped
[14:04] into the fiery furnace but the Fourth
[14:07] Man brought Deliverance to them amen
[14:09] amen
[14:11] amen so we find Daniel is the eagle in
[14:14] Babylon
[14:15] and we know Daniel is praying seeking
[14:18] wisdom and he has such a amen and his
[14:21] prayer causes Devastation in the
[14:24] spiritual Realm yes chaos in the
[14:27] spiritual reality he's in his room but
[14:30] he's causing chaos in the heavenlies yes
[14:33] amen
[14:34] amen amen he's shaking the spiritual
[14:37] world
[14:39] and look how violent it gets When you
[14:41] pray
[14:44] it may seem like it's quiet in the house
[14:47] nothing happening
[14:49] but there's violence happening
[14:51] amen Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven
[14:54] suffered violence and the violent taken
[14:56] by force
[14:58] amen
[15:00] hallelujah oh bless his name I want to
[15:04] take it now and show you
[15:05] amram
[15:07] amen
[15:09] amram is Moses father
[15:13] and I'm showing you that it's a time of
[15:15] intercession right now amen
[15:17] it's a time of consecration right now
[15:19] because
[15:21] through Abraham's prayer came
[15:22] Deliverance the answer was Moses
[15:26] and we'll take it from the prophet and
[15:29] show you how he dramatizes this now
[15:31] right
[15:32] and he says here
[15:33] and I want you to also catch a
[15:36] revelation of this
[15:37] and not just stop somebody but encourage
[15:40] one another
[15:42] amen
[15:43] so yeah we see now watch M Ram is how
[15:46] many letters there
[15:49] five
[15:50] okay so we see him night after night as
[15:53] amram climbed the stairs and Joseph Beth
[15:56] would come up to him and say amram dear
[15:58] you've been here praying all night
[16:01] why don't you just tell some of the boys
[16:03] you're working with let them pray a
[16:05] while
[16:10] right think in the terms of us now
[16:13] um
[16:14] amen
[16:16] now this is Moses mother and father
[16:18] before Moses was born well honey what if
[16:22] they don't do it somebody has got to do
[16:24] it
[16:27] think in the Realms of the message now
[16:30] amen I really believe at one stage we
[16:33] were speculating but I really believe
[16:35] that we are the people calling in the
[16:37] shower amen amen oh come on connect to
[16:41] that right now I really believe we are
[16:43] the people called in the hour right now
[16:45] somebody has got to do it who will raise
[16:47] their hand up with me and say Yes me
[16:49] Lord I'll do it they don't want to pray
[16:52] but we will pray they don't want to seek
[16:55] the Lord but we will seek the Lord they
[16:57] don't want Revival but we will bring
[16:58] Revival amen amen yes Mom somebody has
[17:03] got to pray through
[17:04] yes amen he says that's the way every
[17:07] Christian ought to feel tonight not
[17:09] waiting for somebody else but take the
[17:12] front ourselves and go through amen amen
[17:15] Lord I want that to be me amen amen
[17:18] amen hallelujah so then that night he
[17:22] said I'm going up to pray like I've
[17:24] never prayed before
[17:26] amen now that's the way to pray isn't it
[17:30] pray like you've never prayed before
[17:32] really get to business
[17:35] if it's just go up and say Lord bless so
[17:38] and so
[17:39] God don't take much interest in that
[17:44] bless this person bless that person
[17:46] bless this person
[17:51] God takes note when you challenge him
[17:53] amen when you take him at his word yes
[17:56] amen
[17:57] imagine God day every night what's wrong
[17:59] with every day I must bless this person
[18:01] bless bless bless bless
[18:03] don't they have a revelation they're
[18:04] blessed coming in and they're blessed
[18:06] going out amen amen nobody can take your
[18:10] blessing yeah if your lot is allotted to
[18:12] you amen he says but when you really get
[18:15] down to business
[18:17] he says oh I don't know what to do but
[18:20] he said dear if somebody don't take the
[18:22] people to heart if somebody don't pray
[18:24] for the people what will we do
[18:26] [Music]
[18:28] watch now it's the same Spirit on Esther
[18:30] in the Kingdom
[18:34] he says we're getting worse surely
[18:36] sometimes God will hear
[18:39] amen now if you track back our history
[18:41] wasn't that our concern yes
[18:44] what's happening to the people
[18:48] amen
[18:51] he says oh this time he goes upstairs
[18:54] different
[18:55] maybe even tonight maybe in the time
[18:58] passed you went in a different way but
[19:00] the next time you go to pray go dear
[19:02] friend
[19:03] he says when he goes up this time he
[19:05] kneels down puts his hand up in the air
[19:08] holler God I'm speaking to you now
[19:10] amen
[19:12] getting to business God that was years
[19:17] and you can hear me
[19:19] that was eyes and you can see amen that
[19:22] was memory you know your word amen you
[19:25] know your promise amen I plea to you God

[19:33] want you to come now in this room

[19:38] amen
[19:40] you're the god of Abraham Isaac Jacob
[19:43] that your people are in distress and
[19:45] they are dying if there's ever a time
[19:48] people are dying it's now
[19:50] spiritual death sweeping across the land
[19:52] if there's ever a Time amram needs to

[20:16] that's when you really pray oh he prayed
[20:20] amen
[20:21] amen
[20:23] and yet the prophet says you know
[20:25] sometimes people when they pray they get
[20:28] tired
[20:31] he says don't they mother and dad oh get
[20:34] so tired brother Branham sometimes get

[22:16] went to the prophet Elisha
[22:18] and Elisha told gehazi to go and take

[23:42] so we find we've got to have a concern
[23:46] amen amen nobody asked and if you can
[23:50] also put up Daniel chapter 9.
[23:53] amen
[23:55] nobody asked Daniel
[23:58] to do what he did
[24:00] Daniel was like amrap
[24:02] the Bible says here in nine
[24:08] chapter two let's take it from there in
[24:11] the first year of his Reign I Daniel
[24:13] understood by books the number of years
[24:16] where of the word of the Lord came to
[24:18] Jeremiah the prophet that he would
[24:20] accomplish 70 years in the desolation of
[24:22] Jerusalem now
[24:26] we are in another Babylon
[24:29] and we don't Daniel is the eagle we are
[24:32] the eagle yes and we understood when we
[24:35] looked we came to random the prophet
[24:39] amen and we're understanding that our
[24:41] times and our season
[24:43] the 17 year speaks about the times and
[24:45] seasons of natural Israel
[24:47] but in our time when we come to Brandon
[24:50] the prophet we understand our times and
[24:52] season and we know we don't have much
[24:54] longer amen
[24:57] amen
[24:58] because everything is going full steam
[25:01] ahead
[25:02] the world is going full steam ahead amen
[25:05] the devil is going full stream ahead
[25:07] amen politics demon powers religion full
[25:11] steam ahead
[25:13] amen amen I said this before I'm going
[25:14] to say it again the final documents for
[25:17] the one world religion has already been
[25:19] signed yes there's no more meetings it's
[25:22] all in place
[25:24] they are just waiting now they don't
[25:26] know in the state of limbo don't know
[25:28] what's happening why the angel is here
[25:30] on the earth amen one foot on the land
[25:33] one foot on the sea amen amen amen they
[25:37] can't make a move now until the Angel
[25:39] takes his foot off of them
[25:41] amen hallelujah yes and Israel as well
[25:45] wondering hey what's happening what's
[25:47] happening because there's four Angels
[25:49] holding back the winds holding back the
[25:51] walls
[25:53] amen
[25:55] amen
[25:56] hallelujah who can speak with such
[25:58] Clarity in this hour if not the Flying
[26:00] Eagle amen yes
[26:03] amen
[26:04] So Daniel chapter 9 verse 3 says I set
[26:07] my face unto the Lord to seek by prayer
[26:10] supplications fasting sackcloth and
[26:14] Ashes
[26:16] we just read we need to get desperate
[26:18] amen
[26:20] amen
[26:21] and I prayed unto the Lord my God and
[26:24] made my confession and said oh Lord the
[26:27] great and Dreadful God keeping the
[26:29] Covenant and mercy to them that love him
[26:32] and to them that keep his Commandments
[26:35] we have sinned and have committed
[26:37] iniquity and have done wickedly and have
[26:40] rebelled even by departing from thy
[26:42] precepts and from their judgments
[26:45] now he goes on and he's praying and he's
[26:47] praying and he's praying
[26:50] amen
[26:51] we're not going to read all of which you
[26:53] can read it amen so what am I trying to
[26:55] tell you that Daniel the eagle in that
[26:58] hour had to enter a time of intercession
[27:00] a time of prayer for the people amen the
[27:04] people are unaware of it the rest of the
[27:07] message community in Babylon were
[27:08] unaware of it but there was a selected
[27:11] few people that cried out to the Lord
[27:13] amen
[27:15] Selected Few people like amaran cried
[27:17] out to the Lord amen
[27:19] amen
[27:21] so our ministry is not always going to
[27:23] be a public show it's going to be behind
[27:25] closed doors
[27:27] amen
[27:29] somebody has got to take on the
[27:30] responsibility somebody has got to take
[27:33] on the burden Lord we know it just any
[27:35] time now something's gonna happen it's
[27:37] like Daniel something must happen now
[27:39] hmm get to seeking the Lord amen
[27:42] hallelujah
[27:45] so yeah amen from verse 20 on you'll
[27:48] find
[27:50] some of you get that
[27:54] remember Exodus 23 from verse 20
[27:56] remember Joel chapter 2 from verse 20.
[28:01] yeah Daniel chapter 9 from verse 20 and
[28:04] while I was speaking and praying
[28:05] confessing my sin and the sin of my
[28:08] people and presenting my supplication
[28:10] before the Lord my God for my for the
[28:13] Holy Mountain of my God
[28:15] while I was speaking in prayer even the
[28:18] man Gabriel
[28:19] who might seen in the vision at the
[28:21] beginning being caused to fly swiftly
[28:24] touched me about the time of the evening
[28:27] oblation
[28:28] amen
[28:29] thank you Lord
[28:31] amen the evening sacrifice yes amen the
[28:35] angel of the Lord comes down and he
[28:37] informed me talked with me and said oh
[28:39] Daniel I'm not Comfort to give this
[28:41] skill and understanding and yeah in
[28:43] verse 23 he tells him
[28:45] at the beginning of your supplications
[28:48] the Commandment came fourth
[28:53] I am come to show thee for thou art
[28:55] greatly beloved therefore understand the
[28:57] matter and consider the vision amen
[29:01] when you get to praying in this hour
[29:02] another Daniel
[29:05] angels are commissioned amen
[29:08] Gabriel may have been busy with other
[29:09] things yes but he says at the beginning
[29:11] of your supplication
[29:14] the Commandment came forth to me amen go
[29:18] to Daniel
[29:19] amen now this is not the time that he
[29:21] was withheld 21 days that's in the
[29:23] chapter before right
[29:25] amen amen
[29:28] so it shows you that every time Daniel
[29:31] Prayed Heaven responded to his prayer
[29:33] amen amen what am I trying to tell you

[29:48] first before it can go externally right
[29:52] now we're experiencing the Deliverance
[29:53] internally in every life we've
[29:56] experiencing Deliverance amen we are
[29:58] praying for total Deliverance if you
[30:00] have not received Deliverance yes no
[30:04] amen and let me give you a clue and a
[30:07] secret now the reason why some people
[30:09] have not stepped over into the
[30:11] Deliverance is because of this
[30:14] no praise
[30:16] no Judah
[30:18] Judah means praise amen
[30:22] amen
[30:24] this is key yeah

[33:56] you thank you amen
[33:58] energize blood flow
[34:01] amen
[34:05] glory be to his name
[34:09] so we just showed you Daniel now
[34:12] Daniel in Babylon had a concern
[34:15] now I don't want to go into Esther but
[34:18] you go and see Esther's Queen
[34:22] esteve is a position in a position
[34:25] of royalty
[34:28] she's the married wife of the king yes
[34:31] amen
[34:33] what is your current status
[34:36] if not married wife of the king yes
[34:41] amen invisible Union let me preach it
[34:44] yes then we preach marriage of the Lamb
[34:47] yes
[34:49] amen didn't he say you came
[34:51] predestinated from heaven with a
[34:53] marriage ring on your finger of
[34:55] predestinated Grace amen
[34:58] you are Mrs Jesus Christ yes amen
[35:00] standing in your position walking around
[35:03] the palace with no Authority
[35:05] but somebody needs to remind you of why
[35:07] you are there that's right
[35:09] amen and Mordecai comes to tell her
[35:11] don't think that because you are in the
[35:13] King's house you shall Escape
[35:18] what's put into law will even affect you
[35:21] in the house
[35:22] then we read on Sunday that Elijah was
[35:25] subject to his own prophecy that there
[35:28] shall be no rain yes that even the brook
[35:30] dried up because of his own word of
[35:32] Prophecy
[35:34] so once a word is released
[35:37] it becomes law
[35:41] amen but who are to rewrite the laws
[35:45] the one that has power to do it
[35:48] the one that has power to appeal to the
[35:50] king
[35:51] amen but there's a beautiful story there
[35:53] you need to read it amen and see how she
[35:55] steps into that intercession
[35:57] Deliverance is coming because of you
[35:59] amen
[36:01] amen
[36:03] amen
[36:05] if I had to break it down in a nutshell
[36:07] and tell you right now
[36:10] if there is four
[36:12] unsaved ones now that we are waiting for
[36:14] the last one to come in how is the
[36:16] Deliverance going to come in
[36:18] if not from you yes amen amen because
[36:21] through foolishness of preaching the
[36:22] gospel he has chosen to save man
[36:26] so it's our duty to prophesy again yes
[36:29] amen amen hallelujah so we find Daniel
[36:32] Day in Babylon he had a hard time
[36:34] because they were changing laws amen
[36:37] amen they were changing laws trying to
[36:39] stop his prayer life but Daniel will not
[36:42] allow the laws of the land to stop him
[36:43] from praying
[36:45] and he didn't pray differently
[36:49] amen you open up the windows as at other
[36:51] times the Bible says and pray to God so
[36:54] just because the enemy is not pleased
[36:56] with your prayer life amen and he may
[36:59] try to shut you down amen tell the devil
[37:02] that's your problem yeah
[37:04] amen
[37:06] amen if your husband don't like you to
[37:07] pray tell him that's your problem
[37:09] if your wife don't like you to pray tell
[37:11] you that's your problem yes
[37:13] if your children don't like you to pray
[37:15] tell them that's your problem
[37:17] don't make your problem my problem
[37:19] [Music]
[37:23] amen
[37:27] and maybe maybe through the cause of
[37:29] life through situations in life we've
[37:31] catered to the devil
[37:33] with catered to his plan for us in
[37:35] leadership we've catered for his work
[37:37] plans
[37:39] people can sacrifice they won't come to
[37:41] church but they'll go to work
[37:46] they'll finish on time they can even
[37:48] come here after seven but they won't
[37:49] make the effort
[37:51] they'll make all manner of excuses
[37:54] and if you are working overtime
[37:56] there's no excuse why you're not just
[37:57] here to be in the house of the Lord
