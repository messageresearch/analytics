[25:08] find comfort in his words a man and
[25:12] complicate what he come to Jesus Christ
[25:15] no matter what man would search and no
[25:17] matter what man would do comfort can
[25:19] when he come to Jesus Christ
[25:21] peace can come from inkle he is the
[25:24] Prince of Peace and he is the one that
[25:27] can give joy that is unspeakable amen
[25:31] joy can when he come from him and we
[25:34] thank you for all that is done if you
[25:35] got your Bibles we're gonna turn
[25:42] the book of Revelation the book of
[25:46] Revelation reading from Chapter II now
[25:49] we know that the Greek word for
[25:52] revelation is the populace and pocalypse
[25:56] means the unveiling right
[25:58] so it's something that the book of
[26:01] Revelation is a mysterious book it's a
[26:04] book in simple form and all these things
[26:09] were was meant to be that way God
[26:11] designed it that way so it would not be
[26:14] known to everybody
[26:17] the book of Revelation cannot be
[26:19] understand stood by man's wisdom he
[26:25] cannot be understood by theology he had
[26:29] to be revealed by God himself
[26:31] it is the book of the revelation of
[26:34] Jesus Christ Himself came at him which
[26:37] was revealed to his servant John on the
[26:39] Isle of Patmos runabout 1895 revelation
[26:44] chapter 8 verse 1 and when he had opened
[26:47] the Seventh Seal There was silence in
[26:50] heaven about the space of half an hour
[26:54] hey man we think what's the reading of
[26:57] his word and when he had opened the
[27:01] Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven
[27:03] about the space of half an hour you may
[27:06] be seated in a couple of moments yeah
[27:13] the book of Revelation says
[27:16] and what Johnny singing simple for me
[27:19] saying when he had opened the Seventh
[27:20] Seal There was silence in heaven about
[27:23] the space of an hour so we know that the
[27:30] moment the whole 16 Matthew 24 Jesus is
[27:33] reading the six seals and that's in
[27:36] written form in metrically form
[27:38] amen we have the seals in written form
[27:41] in the book of Revelation chapter 5 we
[27:45] find the book is closed and Revelation
[27:48] chapter 6 the Lamb steps and began to
[27:52] open the seals but that's in simple form
[27:54] but God decided in such a way that in
[27:58] the end of the seven church age when the
[28:02] seventh messenger is there by was a
[28:05] revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice
[28:07] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[28:10] to sound the mystery of God shall be
[28:13] finished so we know that here we see
[28:17] revelation it will come to the seventh
[28:19] seal we see a space of half an hour but
[28:25] we find in Revelation Jan 1 it says and
[28:28] I saw another mighty angel come down
[28:30] from heaven amen
[28:33] so we know there was there was something
[28:35] happening in Revelation 10 in Gen 1 and
[28:38] this mighty angel is coming down to
[28:41] Revelation 2 and 7 to the seventh age
[28:44] messenger on to the earthly messenger to
[28:47] the earthly angel on the earth at a time
[28:49] he must come to him amen and this mighty
[28:52] angel is coming from an unseen world
[28:55] amen so we find here a great secret a
[29:01] great secret that is locked up in the
[29:04] Bible and Jesus speaks about all the six
[29:07] seals now when he comes to that seven
[29:09] seal it's a secret
[29:12] johnny is now seeing the field in seven
[29:15] former he comes in at seven seal their
[29:17] silence in heaven hey man so we know
[29:21] that the Seventh Seal was a great secret
[29:24] it wasn't to be known to everybody we
[29:28] find that when when the son of man
[29:30] ministry come D as three pools the first
[29:33] two pool was to attract the attention of
[29:35] the people healing the sick multitudes
[29:39] were healed it was a mass ministry then
[29:42] we had the discernment but the Dead Pool
[29:46] was a secret because this was only going
[29:50] to be revealed at in a certain place
[29:52] Amen God was going to reveal this secret
[29:56] in a certain place amen
[30:00] you see I got two things matrimony for
[30:05] 26 days wherefore if they shall say up
[30:08] to you be always in a desert go not
[30:10] forth we are always in the secret
[30:13] chambers believe it not for as the
[30:17] Lightning cover of the east and shineth
[30:19] even unto the West so shall also the
[30:23] coming of the Son of man be for whereas
[30:27] the carcass is there will the eagle's be
[30:30] gathered together amen
[30:33] he wants to meet us in a certain place
[30:36] and that was God's provided place of
[30:39] worship and the secret has been going on
[30:42] for 57 years amen
[30:46] there was an invisible union taking
[30:50] place and he is going on for fifty seven
[30:53] girls because what is the secret that
[30:57] there was silence in heaven amen
[31:00] God had to come himself and reveal
[31:05] himself to his bride amen because why
[31:11] there must be an awakening those seven
[31:15] thunders come to awaken
[31:17] it come out to make it it comes to make
[31:20] a realize then there was a wedding band
[31:22] of grace put on earth as a problem God
[31:26] puts it a wedding band of grace put on
[31:30] air before the foundation of the world
[31:32] she was predestinated for a time like
[31:34] this she was predestinated for a purpose
[31:38] amen but here's the proper of God under
[31:43] us at this time and prior to going to
[31:48] the West he speaks to the church about
[31:51] when God showed in a vision that are you
[31:53] what will happen what will take place
[31:55] and when he must go to the Wizards he
[31:57] had to be in a certain place amen
[32:00] and the time comes when he is there
[32:02] hunting and he's in a certain place then
[32:07] what happened there's a great shaking
[32:11] there's an earthquake takes place what
[32:15] happened seven angel breaks the time
[32:18] barrier come down from an unseen world
[32:20] and it comes to this property management
[32:23] amen revelation 10:1 coming down feeling
[32:28] it to Revelation ten seven solely for
[32:31] the purpose of Revelation 10 8 to 11
[32:34] solely for the purpose of an elected
[32:38] people on the early man amen
[32:40] God was meeting a prophet not meeting a
[32:44] Pope not meeting a president not meeting
[32:47] a king God cannot change the order of
[32:50] things the Word of God must come to a
[32:52] prophet amen
[32:55] you find this day you find in the Bible
[32:59] when the prophets want to see the
[33:03] Prophet would go to the king and the
[33:04] prophet of prophesy and the prophet who
[33:08] tell the King exactly what he does say
[33:11] the Lord the Prophet wouldn't compromise
[33:14] the proper wouldn't be a soothsayer he
[33:18] will go and tell the king you have done
[33:20] dust dust dust and therefore the Lord is
[33:22] going to do this the Lord is going to
[33:25] bring these plagues upon you because of
[33:27] your action
[33:28] you have turned away from God but now we
[33:30] have false anointed ones on the earth
[33:34] they are purely before Pope's appearing
[33:37] before the Kings appearing before
[33:39] presidents and being soothsayers to them
[33:44] God did not call us for that amen amen
[33:47] amen

[34:01] but through the second Adam amen - Jesus
[34:06] Christ we are going to be taken out of
[34:08] here we are going to go back to our
[34:10] original condition but there was this
[34:14] great secrets that God eat from
[34:17] everybody what is this great secret then
[34:20] the world nobody else preaches about it
[34:23] until now and everyone's getting
[34:25] awakened to what is happening around
[34:27] them they want to know how called the
[34:28] coming of the Lord but this was a secret
[34:31] all these years
[34:32] amen amen what was that it was this
[34:35] rupture the Bible doesn't use the words
[34:39] actually
[34:40] it talks about being caught up being
[34:41] translated but it was a secret and while
[34:49] also that the process of the rapture
[34:50] began already what what the Book of Paul
[34:54] says you want just thrown Ian's holy
[34:56] saying he said the Lord Himself he meant
[35:01] not anybody else when he said the Lord
[35:05] himself shall descend from heaven amen

[46:12] our governments are being deceived you
[46:16] think you look at your news and you hear
[46:19] a low coming from your government you
[46:21] think that from your government but yeah

[46:26] being advised we are being advised by
[46:30] scientific evidence and from the whu-oh
[46:33] who are all these people controlled by
[46:35] who is behind the scenes and all the
[46:39] companies are being advised by these
[46:40] people so your government is not making
[46:43] their own rules our governments are
[46:47] being in violence a man and all this is
[46:49] coming from room because Jezebel is
[46:52] treacherous and behind the scenes Jerry

[47:38] will shine in darkness
[47:39] I'm trying darkness so we are not the
[47:45] children of the darkness we are the
[47:46] children of the light of the day amen we
[47:48] are the children of the nights when we
[47:51] are children of the day and we walk in
[47:53] lights even as he is alive
[47:57] so God in order to keep his hidden
[48:00] secrets between himself and they elected
[48:03] alone he didn't want anyone else to know
[48:05] it and at the same time Satan is moving
[48:10] to destroy the earth you want to destroy
[48:12] the Christians that destroy is his
[48:17] church world none destroy people that
[48:20] have part in his movement he's getting
[48:21] the people together as God and there was
[48:24] an invisible union with the bride in
[48:26] Christ there's also a union a
[48:29] confederation of churches there are also
[48:32] Union TV please a dialogue with all
[48:35] religions religions politics everything
[48:38] was coming together just like in the
[48:41] days of Jesus before they crucified
[48:44] Jesus what happened people like my
[48:47] enemies here coming together with Pilate
[48:50] coming together when they're Jews with
[48:52] Sanhedrin all these people are coming
[48:55] together and they have the same thing
[48:57] that's happening today
[49:01] and therefore we Matthew 24 Jesus giving
[49:06] out the seals there when he came through
[49:09] at 7 seal amen
[49:12] he said that's to be known and given he
[49:14] kept it further in time he kept it
[49:18] because they were the proper that will
[49:19] come him an and picking up from there
[49:21] hey man the last Church a messenger will
[49:24] come you know come and pick up from
[49:26] there but he was the proper himself you
[49:30] wouldn't know what this thing until he
[49:33] had to hear from an unseen world he had
[49:35] to go and be obedient to God see a
[49:39] program bodies of beat in the world he
[49:41] will follow God and he's keep still
[49:44] until God shows him because appropriate
[49:47] God will only move in the pillar of fire
[49:48] moves when they pull up - stops he stops
[49:51] I want to put a fire moves he moves and
[49:55] the people that come out they're missing
[49:57] you will follow the same pattern hmm
[49:59] when they pull out fire stops she stops
[50:01] when they pull out fire move she moves
[50:03] because she knows that when the pillar
[50:05] of fire is moving and she's moving under
[50:07] that put a fire then ask what you
[50:09] worried about me and I am fine you ask
[50:11] what you will and you shall receive
[50:14] Amen because you know now you are under
[50:17] the protection of God nothing gets
[50:20] changing your way at that time amen
[50:22] when the fellow fire is moving and you
[50:24] are moving no enemy can stand between
[50:26] you
[50:34] and he come Jesus come in written in
[50:36] written form is speaking about the first
[50:39] six here John come in simple form is
[50:41] giving on a stick she'll come to at
[50:44] seven they were silenced I'll be glad
[50:47] for that Jesus said what did Jesus say
[50:49] to Peter blessed are thou simon barjona
[50:52] flesh and blood have not revealed this
[50:54] to you and this is the time when Peter
[50:57] said thou art the Christ the Son of the
[50:59] Living God he said for my father which
[51:01] is in heaven as reveals to you and he
[51:04] said upon this rock I will build my
[51:07] church
[51:08] what does it spiritual revelation God's
[51:12] church is built upon spiritual
[51:13] revelation this third pole is a total
[51:16] sequence amen Satan knows nothing about
[51:18] it amen
[51:20] because they had he known he would have
[51:22] brought he would have brought what he
[51:23] did in the first two pools he would have
[51:26] brought a fake or a copy like of it but
[51:35] God kept it a total secret amen
[51:39] he couldn't make he couldn't make
[51:43] something out of the water is not there
[51:44] amen
[51:55] so we find that God has chosen and
[51:58] elected people all over the earth
[51:59] amen every age glutted a messenger every
[52:03] age God had a message and he sealed him
[52:05] up for the rage as soon as they come

[52:07] and right here now he called out out a
[52:10] man he called us out that he's given us
[52:14] his word but we know it's coming to a
[52:16] cuts now it's coming to a chiming where

[53:56] also
[53:57] amen some of other unconscious of the
[54:00] unseen world that is why we get on the
[54:02] way we do but we are conscious that the
[54:04] angel of God is yet hasn't left the
[54:06] earth he's come to make reparation for
[54:08] us to leave he come to show us things
[54:11] amen every time you reading the news

[54:19] thing we come to show you yourselves in
[54:22] the scriptures before the seals are open
[54:25] you didn't see your name in a book but
[54:27] now when the seals all open you began to
[54:28] see your name you begin to see your part
[54:31] in the scripture amen
[54:33] and you began to be awakened to these
[54:35] things and that's what something some of
[54:38] us did you be conscious sometime we need
[54:40] to have a conscience here's a man to
[54:43] recognize his presence amongst us if you
[54:46] recognize his presence you wouldn't
[54:47] continue in living in the only things
[54:49] living in carnal things you recognize
[54:53] that God has sent his angel amen for
[54:58] what to be preparation for us to leave
[55:01] preparation for us to take our flight
[55:03] others who are of this temporal world
[55:05] some people want to sacrifice temporal
[55:08] living you'll get a person's life span
[55:13] the most you can live a proper life from
[55:17] 70 after that you go 80 and your body
[55:20] can't take it you don't want to live on
[55:23] the earth anymore every day you're
[55:25] getting older you don't want to live on
[55:26] the earth it only makes you realize that
[55:30] you are meant to have life each day
[55:34] you're dying you recognize that you are
[55:36] meant to look because wouldn't you you
[55:38] can the death the body is showing the
[55:40] results but what in you you still feel
[55:42] youthful because in you within you the
[55:44] real you you want to live because you're
[55:48] not meant to die you the first but makes
[55:52] you die but by the new world you don't
[55:55] mean to die when you got the new but you
[55:57] don't see yourself time remaining
[55:59] because when you see it when you watch
[56:01] your person here the person says but I
[56:03] watch my last my loved one take the last
[56:05] breath what you saw
[56:08] was not death taking the last breaths
[56:10] they left that body and that's why that
[56:13] body took the last breaths that person
[56:16] if they wanna believe they left that
[56:17] body when the spirit comes out of the
[56:19] body the body died but that person never
[56:22] time that's why it's Steven when he was
[56:25] big stone he said I could see heavens
[56:27] opened because he has already anything
[56:29] to that dimension he already was gonna
[56:30] leave that body and he saw that body
[56:32] died it but he left that body and that
[56:36] is why pockets say old tips when you're
[56:38] singing oh great with radio actually
[56:41] amen
[56:42] there is no fear in death to a believer
[56:45] in fact the Bible says perfect love
[56:47] custody we all feel a man and perfect
[56:50] long is one your Christ and when you
[56:52] come in perfect love you can walk in
[56:54] perfect faith because now you come on is
[56:57] provided place of worship you come into
[56:59] obedience to Christ and you can walk in
[57:01] perfect faith knowing who you are and
[57:03] now you can go like a structure the king
[57:06] she knows that its depth it can take
[57:10] depth but you know she is she knows the
[57:14] king she knows she wasn't I'm sure for
[57:17] long as the Kings love for her she knew
[57:20] how much the King loved it she knew how
[57:23] much he loved it so she ran by faith
[57:25] even though she said it can be dipped
[57:28] she said she's willing to do that she
[57:31] waiting to crunch but she consecrated
[57:33] her life she didn't this go after hasn't
[57:36] lead to the king she consecrated her
[57:37] life amen
[57:39] she got the people to consecrate
[57:42] themselves she got the people to fast
[57:44] and pray she got the people surrender

[1:04:06] abomination of the laws because there's
[1:04:08] an intercessory role within you because
[1:04:10] if the Spirit of Christ is in you you
[1:04:12] must want come into the image of Christ
[1:04:14] and you must produce the characteristic
[1:04:16] of Christ which is crying in sign for

[1:04:23] convinced if you are convinced that this
[1:04:25] message is true then you are convinced
[1:04:27] that is coming to be a destruction of
[1:04:29] the earth then you become concerned

[1:04:52] be prosperous no you can't open a soul
[1:04:54] like every I money when they even leave
[1:04:58] god was in the store you never say how
[1:05:01] one day would she are going to destroy
[1:05:03] the whinnies no he believed he knew what
[1:05:06] God is telling him in the truck God is
[1:05:08] gonna destroy he began to be in the
[1:05:09] scene immediately put on ESP roll and he
[1:05:13] began to intercede for what's going to
[1:05:17] take place and he asked God to be
[1:05:18] merciful
[1:05:19] but God couldn't even find him righteous
[1:05:21] in front and you look at the world today
[1:05:24] you telling me that people are gonna
[1:05:27] repent in a time of crisis right now
[1:05:31] where people should actually looking up
[1:05:34] to God and say God be merciful upon us
[1:05:36] god we have 34 sins god we are sorry
[1:05:39] that this world in such a condition you
[1:05:41] didn't people are crying for alcohol
[1:05:43] people are saying where can we go and
[1:05:45] buy a alcohol in the black market where
[1:05:47] can we get our secrets in the black
[1:05:49] market
[1:05:49] where can we get our drugs in the black
[1:05:51] market where can we find some some form
[1:05:53] of pleasure in the black market yet God
[1:05:58] is bringing people on their knees to
[1:05:59] repent time to come to consecration to
[1:06:02] him time to not to be all about us less
[1:06:06] of everything of the world
[1:06:08] time to die to yourself
[1:06:09] and let Christ live in you but the
[1:06:13] people don't want that no do you want to
[1:06:16] live their own lives
[1:06:23] Paul says blessed be the God and father
[1:06:26] of our Lord Jesus Christ when blessed us
[1:06:29] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:06:32] places in Christ I like the way he puts
[1:06:38] it because people will take this and a
[1:06:42] man that is Cardinal a man that put
[1:06:45] looks looks after more of the flesh will
[1:06:49] look at the spiritual blessings and
[1:06:50] start to say that he I like to work the
[1:06:53] use so often they say we have the favor
[1:06:56] of God we highly blessed we are highly
[1:06:58] favored they want to take things that
[1:07:01] the Bible says and speak about the
[1:07:03] material blessings man is always wanting

[1:07:28] amnesia to make us realize who we are
[1:07:31] that we are citizens of an earth a
[1:07:33] heavenly kingdom and eternal Kingdom
[1:07:38] we're not from a government we are from
[1:07:41] a kingdom in a kingdom we are subjects
[1:07:44] amen
[1:07:44] and there's different roles in the
[1:07:46] kingdom in the kingdom the king

[1:08:17] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:08:21] places in Christ amen why would you say

[1:08:31] dimension we're not receiving it from
[1:08:34] this
[1:08:34] we're receiving it in this dimension but
[1:08:36] it's coming from another dimension and
[1:08:37] we have checked into the dimension amen
[1:08:42] if you not jump into that I mentioned
[1:08:43] today then Joe go and call yourself a
[1:08:46] plumber and unclog all those things in
[1:08:51] the line that dirty in the line remove
[1:08:53] of all the dirt that's clogging the line
[1:08:56] that you may tap into the dimension a

[1:09:02] the Holy Ghost come down and transform
[1:09:04] your life remove all the things then

[1:10:06] world that we should be holy you not
[1:10:08] blame before him in love that's why we
[1:10:11] have that band amen

[1:10:15] than waiting man of grace upon us amen
[1:10:17] the chosen of him him before the
[1:10:19] foundation of the world
