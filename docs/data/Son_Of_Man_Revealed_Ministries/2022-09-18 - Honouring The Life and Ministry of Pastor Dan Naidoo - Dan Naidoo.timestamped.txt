[1:46] share this special moment
[1:48] i would also like to apologize that i
[1:50] was not able to come
[1:52] for the funeral
[2:00] because of the challenges that i was
[2:01] facing
[2:03] at the time i cannot express
[2:06] the pain i started losing so many
[2:08] postures i've been longing to see the
[2:11] believers to express
[2:12] condolences
[2:17] i was born in 1944 i got married in 1963
[2:21] very young i received the message in
[2:23] 1967
[2:25] and started the philippines in chapter
[2:28] 23.
[2:39] i got a call from pastor ronnie in 1975
[2:45] to let you know that actually we are
[2:46] family
[2:59] so at that time i had the opportunity of
[3:01] saying hello and i went
[3:29] wearing a tight pens
[3:34] i said there's only one thing that's
[3:35] going to keep this brother away from the
[3:36] message he's his wife
[3:41] adulties work together
[3:53] i looked at him i said why are you sad
[3:55] he said not again my son
[3:58] baby boy only a couple of days to live
[4:02] i said no don't worry jump into the van
[4:04] let's go
[4:05] didn't worry about lunch or anything
[4:08] he went up there
[4:09] if i make speed face maybe under
[4:12] correction
[4:13] got up to the
[4:15] hospital found him in the incubator
[4:18] [Music]
[4:20] these were my words
[4:22] i said if you the god of elijah the
[4:25] prophet of our day and age
[4:30] for the glory of god hallelujah
[4:34] but he suddenly raised up i think they
[4:36] got discharged
[4:39] passing death on the child with past
[4:41] life amen
[4:43] because of god's powerful word oh thank
[4:45] you lord
[4:47] and we always give the glory to jesus
[4:49] yes amen
[4:55] from then onwards pastor ronnie was
[4:57] very faithful in coming to services
[5:01] another day that we had the real
[5:04] type of team
[5:07] to take that tape and give
[5:15] [Music]
[5:30] [Music]
[5:33] we've got to be a very good family
[5:45] accepting the message
[5:47] and fully surrendering to the world
[5:50] [Music]
[5:52] you didn't break away from me yeah
[5:55] amen
[5:56] i don't like brickworks
[5:58] i don't like dislikes
[6:00] and likes
[6:02] i don't like to inside with anybody
[6:04] i like
[6:07] and i found that
[6:11] he's really sincere with the word
[6:14] i used to go out a lot with him
[6:16] i had campaigns everywhere with the 10th
[6:18] meeting
[6:21] in chatham
[6:23] i went to the father easter east
[6:25] victoria
[6:27] i got a campaign there
[6:29] it was one of the biggest churches
[6:33] and then i went to lodi where the
[6:35] muslims are living
[6:37] i probably think there
[6:39] what a challenge i had
[6:41] from the people
[6:43] [Music]
[6:44] and i preached the message leave not
[6:51] because there was a wealthy man there
[6:54] who said he never played tight for a
[6:55] couple of months he got a big check to
[6:57] give
[6:59] and he felt that i was a young man he'd
[7:00] like to give me the check i said don't
[7:02] give me the check
[7:05] those days we were not in for money no
[7:07] offerings i'll never take an offering
[7:09] around my 10th pt
[7:11] never took one
[7:13] i believed like brother
[7:23] so i said you don't give me any money or
[7:25] any trip or anything
[7:26] just come to the services first
[7:30] that's the night i preached not on your
[7:32] own understanding
[7:34] and he took us for supper
[7:36] he said i'm very disappointed
[7:39] as a young man
[7:40] the way you lashing out the people
[7:43] you're making them
[7:45] instead of coming closer to christ
[7:47] [Music]
[7:49] so that was his end
[7:51] that was the end of him
[7:55] from there you see that my wife and i
[7:56] are alone pitching the tent
[8:00] ourselves
[8:02] i used to go only my wife
[8:04] but god would provide the men
[8:07] michael henry was in the area after i
[8:10] went
[8:11] he said you came you bit me on the drop
[8:14] let me help you for the tent
[8:16] where's your men doing to the tent i
[8:17] said no god in my helper
[8:20] but he did the job with these men
[8:23] put the tent and just left between the
[8:25] wall my wife and i put the walls to the
[8:27] tent
[8:29] and we used to see the power of the
[8:31] message amen
[8:34] if you don't mind
[8:43] [Music]
[8:52] yeah
[8:55] so we got onto the message
[8:58] and started working for the lord
[9:01] i had a hard job at the beginning
[9:04] because i was working for a company
[9:06] that uh
[9:09] gave me the van
[9:10] and
[9:13] the assistant to carry the message
[9:14] around
[9:15] that's how god made it possible
[9:20] i went to townships
[9:23] never fear any blacks
[9:26] you had to township something running
[9:28] for the life you would have told you
[9:31] you've been to townships and we've been
[9:32] to places
[9:34] where
[9:35] it was very dangerous
[9:39] i tried to establish a message in the
[9:41] ultimate parts of the earth
[9:50] and the thing is that
[9:51] we've been so
[9:52] [Music]
[9:54] you're broken down by because of so many
[9:56] things happening in life
[10:01] and when
[10:03] we got to a place
[10:04] we didn't care where we're going to
[10:06] sleep what we're going to eat what we're
[10:07] going to do
[10:09] we always just kept the message
[10:11] alive
[10:26] thank you
[10:47] i remember one of the meetings
[10:49] we got that night
[10:52] and we ended up in a room
[10:54] do you know what what room what place it
[10:57] was
[10:58] my wife and i just was so tired
[11:01] traveling for hours
[11:03] we just parked the combi and we just got
[11:05] into the house
[11:08] and they were shown the room to us
[11:10] with the matters on the floor
[11:12] with holes in the side
[11:14] i don't really know running or what was
[11:16] running because we couldn't feel nothing
[11:18] we were too tired to worry about
[11:21] anything
[11:22] we got up the next morning
[11:25] in london this was my experience
[11:30] we got up the morning then only we found
[11:31] where we were sleeping
[11:33] it didn't bother me
[11:36] i used to
[11:38] sometimes go without meals because
[11:41] i was battling that at that time
[11:44] and we used to just
[11:46] struggle i used to go sometime fast
[11:49] and make an excuse i'm always full
[11:52] i used to fast in a couple of days
[11:55] and then preach the word every night in
[11:58] the tent
[11:59] for seven nights ten nights
[12:01] in a row
[12:03] i used to preach
[12:06] this this particular morning
[12:08] one of the neighbor men came to us
[12:11] and said are you the evangelist from
[12:13] devon i said no
[12:16] i'm just a brother from there and came
[12:18] to share the word
[12:19] [Music]
[12:21] so he says with your
[12:23] luggages i said they're sitting on the
[12:25] corner they're in the room
[12:26] he took it he went there he took the
[12:28] luggages he took us
[12:30] he took us and he gave us his bedroom
[12:32] [Music]
[12:34] and he said don't worry
[12:35] for lunch and supper you'll be supplying
[12:37] food also
[12:38] [Music]
[12:40] i said
[12:41] no don't take that problem please bro
[12:44] i'm well aware
[12:46] god will make your way
[12:48] but he said no
[12:49] that's from my heart the lord told me
[12:51] i'm going to do that for you
[12:54] so for five days he looked after us
[12:57] and he cared for us
[13:00] i'm just showing you how god can care
[13:01] for him
[13:05] and he took care of us
[13:09] sometimes i didn't know if i'm coming
[13:10] back home to durban because i didn't
[13:12] have money for fear
[13:13] [Music]
[13:15] from nowhere
[13:17] somebody would come and give me
[13:19] 58
[13:20] for fuel
[13:21] 58 fuel that time you could travel from
[13:23] billboard to derby
[13:25] but today with 500 you can't go to even
[13:27] dearly yeah

[15:38] there's too much of politics
[15:50] how did i receive the message
[15:53] i'm going back to front
[15:57] what happened was i was working in the
[15:59] laundry spotless dry cleaners the name
[16:01] is spotless hey man
[16:06] and we kept up to the knee
[16:08] one thing our company did keep up with
[16:10] the name for the well-established
[16:12] company
[16:13] i happen to run the dipole
[16:17] that time when you run the dipole
[16:19] you got to wash the floor polish the
[16:21] floor clean everything
[16:22] all that you gotta do in the job before
[16:24] you get paid
[16:25] [Music]
[16:26] so
[16:29] it's quite a busy laundry depot
[16:33] and when i was busy i had some friends a
[16:36] lot of friends i had
[16:38] and one of them was a mystery
[16:41] i don't know if you know history
[16:43] mishi was a good friend of mine
[16:46] his family was a good family to me
[16:51] he used to come to the depot every time
[16:53] then one day he passed by he said hey
[16:55] look i got some book here
[16:57] he gave me some books and i took it and
[16:59] put it underneath this
[17:01] table
[17:01] [Music]
[17:03] i forgot fasting for seven days
[17:05] and nights
[17:07] we should fast and pray
[17:10] we should not just take things lightly
[17:12] amen like today in the message
[17:14] everything is likely
[17:16] no
[17:16] seriousness you must be serious about
[17:19] this
[17:20] because this is eternal life
[17:24] so
[17:26] i was fasting for seven nights a day
[17:30] and my brother mark you know him
[17:33] he also was fasting with me
[17:36] and they were talking about
[17:37] predestination we were talking about
[17:39] fore knowledge how god knew us before
[17:41] the foundation of the world
[17:43] and when i sat down one day
[17:46] my last day in fasting something said to
[17:49] me take one of these books and then took
[17:51] it
[17:52] i took the book and i looked and i read
[17:53] the ear and their bit
[17:55] i said is this man speaking like our
[17:56] language
[17:57] [Music]
[17:58] i just talked to this man i took him as
[18:01] a man
[18:02] i said he sounds good man
[18:05] looks the the words and everything
[18:07] looks like
[18:08] something here for me
[18:10] you know there's a deep calling behind
[18:12] that
[18:13] so i responded to the call
[18:15] and when i got through with the book i
[18:17] was excited
[18:19] i was so excited
[18:21] that i felt that this is a prophet after
[18:24] that i said
[18:26] amen and
[18:32] they found me and they said to me they
[18:34] brought a film to shirt people call it
[18:36] the deep
[18:38] we added the flip shown in one of the
[18:40] houses
[18:41] on home
[18:43] i think brother mark zone
[18:45] and we had it shown
[18:48] after that they got together and had tea
[18:50] so i asked him they asked me what do you
[18:52] think about the film i said he's
[18:54] standing like noah on the door and
[18:56] warning that god wanting the judgment
[18:59] follow this
[19:01] we don't accept this message i think
[19:03] we're gonna be destroyed
[19:06] funny enough they didn't take it like
[19:08] that so seriously
[19:10] they just showed the film when they went
[19:11] away yeah
[19:14] i agreed to carry on on my own so the
[19:17] first house that i was opening the guy
[19:18] who gave me the book
[19:21] he opened his garage door
[19:33] [Music]
[19:35] wasn't anything i had because i had
[19:39] [Music]
[19:47] [Music]
[19:49] but in the end when i found jesus
[19:51] everything is love
[19:55] my mother used to get the spirits
[19:59] the thing that worried me about the
[20:01] spirits
[20:02] they tried to destroy other people's
[20:04] lives
[20:21] i don't know why i get through this
[20:22] thing testy and dry
[20:25] now you should drink water
[20:29] the water was like
[20:41] [Music]
[20:47] my father used to welcome to my mother
[20:49] while she was in a spiritual mood i was
[20:51] sitting i was a little boy and i was in
[20:53] the temple
[20:54] watching what was going on
[20:55] [Music]
[20:57] they used to say you know what the
[20:58] neighbors are doing this and that you
[21:00] know
[21:01] to get rid of them you must do something
[21:03] you could blow this kind of
[21:05] powder or some kind of ashes
[21:07] [Music]
[21:10] now that got me worried why would god
[21:12] create something to
[21:13] create
[21:14] evil
[21:16] and
[21:17] the head of the ladies had to be
[21:20] worshipped
[21:21] temple
[21:22] i said i saw this you know
[21:24] gave me what is these things
[21:26] that's why when i got to the world and
[21:28] saw the faith of jesus christ i was
[21:31] ready to accept it amen because i saw
[21:33] something really yeah
[21:36] this message is so real my brother my
[21:38] sister
[21:39] you won't be able to
[21:40] contain it
[21:51] before time runs away on me
[21:54] is there anything else you'd like to
[21:56] hear
[22:02] any experiences
[22:03] [Music]
[22:08] i would like to share some scripture
[22:10] with you before
[22:12] an important part of the scriptures
[22:31] i never wanted to believe in a church
[22:34] but the problem was against
[22:36] organizations and churches
[22:38] because the way they were drawing the
[22:39] people
[22:40] drawing lines
[22:42] so
[22:44] in the end
[22:46] i bought a property in
[22:48] hillary
[22:50] with the house on it
[22:52] and i thought what must i do now
[22:54] i literated the house out
[22:56] and i had a piece of ground lying there
[22:58] and one day i was sitting in my lounge
[23:02] something said to me you ain't win damn
[23:05] grand ham
[23:09] why didn't you build a little cottage or
[23:11] some place for the people to fellowship
[23:13] i've blessed you financially
[23:15] i bless you materially but you haven't
[23:18] given enough
[23:20] so i took up on myself to go to the
[23:22] church amen
[23:24] and i built the church
[23:26] i was working day and night at the
[23:28] church site
[23:30] you saw in the payload and everything
[23:32] yes
[23:33] so
[23:34] i got the church completed
[23:37] we had to get together
[23:41] i don't know if i invited all of you
[23:44] i can't do it
[23:47] i must have i couldn't have
[23:57] [Music]
[24:01] people come and go quickly in this
[24:03] message
[24:05] one little thing you say
[24:08] you turn the last stop in a treat
[24:11] they'll get all upset
[24:15] but those days you can ask grace we used
[24:17] to preach hard
[24:18] [Music]
[24:20] hard like a rock right
[24:23] you can't stand anything that's not
[24:24] right yeah
[24:27] i started to work in kongnami
[24:30] amongst the blacks
[24:32] we would work in nagoma
[24:34] we played in nagoma
[24:36] we should sleep in the arts
[24:38] each of the people in the tires
[24:41] sleep in the family
[24:44] and everything our boys here used to go
[24:46] away when they were babies
[24:48] the black sisters used to take them away
[24:51] and only bring them at midnight home
[24:54] we should trust them so much
[24:57] they should bring your children at
[24:58] midnight back to us and knock at the
[25:01] door
[25:02] but by midnight we ship talking
[25:05] those days we used to spend
[25:07] two o'clock three in the morning talking
[25:08] about the message
[25:10] till the morning every day
[25:13] and getting up six o'clock for work but
[25:15] if you get up us four to go to work
[25:18] because you have to open the laundry six
[25:20] o'clock in the morning
[25:22] only one two hours we sleep and we go
[25:25] and we continue with the message like
[25:27] that amen night after night
[25:30] it was sweet like honey in our
[25:32] tongue
[25:34] but today
[25:36] you go a little bit over time people
[25:37] watching the watch
[25:52] 45 minutes is fine
[25:54] but
[25:59] imagine the prophet of god
[26:01] praying for four thousand people in one
[26:03] night
[26:05] because his sock was socks was tired
[26:08] sucked to his feet
[26:12] and he once said one place i heard him
[26:14] say he was preaching for eight nights
[26:16] day and night yeah
[26:21] imagine how prophet really went through
[26:24] and he said he always leaves uh three
[26:26] o'clock to go and pray
[26:29] and never comes back until the meeting
[26:31] is starting
[26:35] lots of things the prophet did amen
[26:43] i'd like to read a scripture
[26:58] it's in john chapter 10.
[27:18] i don't want
[27:36] look at john 10 30.
[27:40] i and my father are one
[27:46] and the jews took up stones man
[27:49] john 10
[27:51] 13 is that right amen right
[27:54] then the jews took up stones
[27:56] you're going to stone me
[28:01] you know there's a new doctrine going
[28:03] about
[28:04] there's two jesuses or something yeah
[28:08] but do you remember
[28:10] god is one amen amen we listen to you
[28:13] amen
[28:14] jesus answered them and said many more
[28:16] good works have i showed you
[28:18] from my father for which of course
[28:21] your works really stoned me
[28:24] so
[28:25] you were doing it really
[28:28] the jews answered accidents
[28:30] said
[28:32] jesus answered
[28:34] saying
[28:35] for a good work we do strongly not
[28:38] but for blasphemy and we because
[28:41] thou being
[28:42] and man because they shall god
[28:47] jesus said to them is it not
[28:50] written in your law i said we are gods
[28:54] [Music]
[28:55] amen
[29:00] now some people think we are going a
[29:02] little bit crazy
[29:08] to the extent that we keep using the
[29:10] brain in the name
[29:21] amen
[29:23] his being is here
[29:25] many people didn't understand what he
[29:27] said
[29:28] amen
[29:31] he was in a different dimension
[29:33] [Music]
[29:34] his dimension caught him to see
[29:36] spiritual things
[29:39] and you would see the presence of the
[29:40] lord right there
[29:45] he's being here how can he have been
[29:47] here unless he has a
[29:50] person
[29:52] a person you've only ever been
[29:54] be a beam
[29:56] b ingb
[30:01] is being in a man
[30:05] anointing is on me on you
[30:08] the writing is in you
[30:12] that day that jesus
[30:14] that day was jesus
[30:16] flesh god redeemer
[30:20] today spirit god in the flesh
[30:23] working through human flesh
[30:25] his being is a spiritual being amen
[30:32] jews killed jesus
[30:34] god made flesh to call out that from
[30:36] them out of jerusalem judaism to the
[30:40] true lamb of god
[30:42] rejected and killed him
[30:45] came to his own and his own received him
[30:46] not
[30:48] same thing today word mean flesh
[30:53] to call
[30:54] the gentile bride
[30:56] for for his namesake
[30:58] what did they do they rejected and
[31:00] killed
[31:01] [Music]
[31:02] the word
[31:03] yes
[31:04] the true word made flesh spiritual
[31:06] bleeding word two comings
[31:11] one in the flesh one in the spiritual
[31:13] accepted dogmas and peace instead of
[31:23] that day
[31:25] god will make flesh
[31:28] amen
[31:33] god manifested in human fish
[31:36] thought working in human being flesh
[31:38] again amen
[31:42] as the son of man
[31:48] amen
[31:54] i will say something but
[31:56] that you must misunderstand me
[32:03] in the unveiling of god
[32:06] which is to disclose our doctor exposed
[32:09] on
[32:12] unreal amen
[32:18] in page 15
[32:19] i'm reading of god so it was god formed
[32:22] in a man called a prophet
[32:25] see
[32:26] and the word of your lord came to this
[32:28] man so it wasn't the prophet amen the
[32:30] prophet was the real yes but the word
[32:32] was good amen yes the man's word
[32:36] wouldn't act like this
[32:38] see what i mean it cannot act in there
[32:42] in that way many but potentially it was
[32:45] god amen
[32:47] he was the word of god in a form of a
[32:50] man called a man
[32:52] [Music]
[32:53] he never changed his nature
[32:57] how is
[32:59] form
[32:59] amen
[33:14] page 21
[33:16] and this is the editing part
[33:20] quote movie said the word
[33:23] now remember after the word was
[33:25] made manifest
[33:27] all this was moses again
[33:31] so there was a time where the word was
[33:33] in brotherhood
[33:35] the time of ministry changed that's
[33:38] right
[33:39] god took
[33:40] one redeemed man
[33:42] amen
[33:44] work of redemption has two two words yes
[33:47] one issue
[33:48] one is to clean yes
[33:50] reclaiming ministry was given to over to
[33:53] i'm putting plain to your husband
[33:55] [Music]
[33:57] he had to do the claiming that's why
[33:59] the lamb came and took the book
[34:02] he's no physical lamb at all
[34:05] it's a spiritual happening
[34:08] right
[34:09] taking the book and opening the sea
[34:12] who did that
[34:14] it looks like
[34:16] somebody came from heaven and did that
[34:18] no
[34:19] it was the same man called william made
[34:21] it brand new amen yes
[34:26] but listen to this quote it will help
[34:28] you
[34:29] page 21.
[34:32] after the word was made manifest moses
[34:34] was moses again
[34:36] but while that word
[34:37] was in him
[34:39] to be
[34:40] cured out
[34:42] he was god
[34:43] [Music]
[34:46] right
[34:46] depending on what you can see
[34:49] amen
[34:50] because what i see
[34:51] is different to maybe what you see
[34:54] you're seeing your wheel
[34:57] but like you've got to receive beyond
[34:58] amen
[35:00] who are you dealing with yes
[35:02] you're dealing with god yes right
[35:13] to give out the
[35:15] he was god well he went it wasn't moses
[35:19] no more he had the word of the lord for
[35:22] that age amen nothing
[35:24] could touch him till that word was over
[35:27] had the word with thee
[35:31] so therefore
[35:33] when you come the people tend that their
[35:34] face heads
[35:37] this was the same experience they had
[35:38] with brother brennan
[35:40] understand truly they had been changed
[35:43] he was a
[35:49] he was a different fellow
[35:51] he comes with the word
[35:53] and he put his weight on him
[35:56] the bible said
[35:58] if moses had to put away brother and
[36:00] sister what do you think without message
[36:02] we have to do
[36:05] he had the word and he was the word in
[36:08] them
[36:09] [Music]
[36:10] you are the word to them
[36:12] amen
[36:20] i was preaching in 1992
[36:22] [Music]
[36:25] from the son of man
[36:26] [Music]
[36:28] god showed me the ministry of the
[36:30] prophet more than a man
[36:43] the other coat is one
[36:54] like he was in moses
[36:56] when the word was in moses he was
[36:59] god
[37:00] in flesh
[37:04] amen
[37:05] so for you to say brother branham was
[37:08] not god in fresh
[37:10] he'd be defeating the purpose
[37:12] because there was a time that he went to
[37:14] the west
[37:15] caught up with the seventh day
[37:17] ministry
[37:18] came down
[37:19] not two angels now one injured only can
[37:22] be done
[37:23] and he was connected with an earthly
[37:25] angel
[37:26] heavenly angel connected with earth amen
[37:29] became one not two
[37:31] then you are believing in two gods again
[37:34] so you have to believe in one god
[37:36] [Music]
[37:40] when it was in jesus it was god in flesh
[37:42] amen
[37:48] not his nature is the same history today
[37:51] and forever
[37:54] he changed
[37:55] from moses to
[37:57] david from david to joseph
[37:59] on down
[38:01] then they came into the fullness of the
[38:03] goddamn body amen amen the bodily the
[38:07] fullness of the goddess
[38:09] couldn't be completed until the ministry
[38:11] of the son of man
[38:20] [Music]
[38:22] you see always brother brandon reading
[38:24] evil chapter one
[38:28] he's going to the
[38:30] beginning
[38:32] before the beginning
[38:33] [Music]
[38:34] was there
[38:35] [Music]
[38:44] this day the scripture is fulfilled
[38:50] you see we gentiles didn't receive a
[38:52] messiah
[38:53] yes
[38:54] the messiah signed was only through
[38:57] yeah
[38:59] calling out a name not under the name of
[39:01] william graham
[39:02] calling it the people out of the
[39:04] gentiles for his namesake
[39:06] was the ministry of the son of man
[39:11] so we become messiahs yes
[39:15] and today
[39:16] halloween was here brother
[39:18] with the bride
[39:27] we were not looking for a messiah
[39:38] see where brother places his ministry
[39:43] but those who claim to be looking for
[39:45] him the church itself when they seen
[39:48] that was done they said he's a devil
[39:50] he's a fortune trainer
[39:53] a
[39:54] baltimore and jesus said
[39:57] that sin will be forgiven there because
[40:00] he
[40:00] hadn't died yet but we need some day
[40:03] when the holy ghost comes
[40:05] see
[40:06] this very being the holy ghost itself
[40:09] had to come and one vindicated ministry
[40:12] and that ministry was only fulfilled
[40:15] by coming back
[40:17] and fulfilling it in the son of man amen
[40:19] amen
[40:21] someday the holy ghost will come and do
[40:23] the same thing and to speak one word
[40:26] against it will never be forgiven amen
[40:29] that's this day with the romans
[40:31] where every word has to be
[40:33] together speak one word against it will
[40:36] never be forgiven in the world to come
[40:52] that was jesus yesterday that's him
[40:54] today
[40:56] [Music]
[41:10] i'll just close now
[41:14] i get very conscious you know
[41:18] worrying about kids and children
[41:20] and babies
[41:24] he's referring to
[41:26] genesis 22.
[41:29] he called this man the name of hillary
[41:32] why did
[41:33] you do it god reprising human flesh
[41:36] i sat down with
[41:38] abraham and ate the
[41:41] sandwich drinking some milk and eating
[41:44] some corn
[41:47] god himself and disappeared right before
[41:49] even
[41:54] the same sign has come back to us
[42:02] the seventh series is coming
[42:05] amen
[42:14] it can't be in a corporate body but he's
[42:16] here
[42:17] in a spiritual body
[42:19] in the form of the holy spirit
[42:24] i would love to see him well now how can
[42:26] you see him the way we can see him is by
[42:29] his works amen no he hasn't come in a
[42:32] cochlear body yet and one is
[42:35] on us he's here in the spiritual body
[42:38] yes you believe that he's feeling that
[42:40] word called the holy spirit
[42:42] he's in the form of
[42:43] amen
[42:46] so there was only one way for the holy
[42:47] spirit to reveal himself
[42:49] was to work through a body of flesh
[42:53] that was the first
[42:55] of the beginning amen that the first
[42:57] sheep will get an idea of what
[43:00] pedestrian ships will get
[43:02] when they win
[43:13] that day it was flesh god today it
[43:16] spirit god in flesh
[43:17] [Music]
[43:19] that's my understanding brother sister
[43:21] yeah
[43:23] in the beginning god was a spirit and
[43:25] all the fountain of the life
[43:28] says
[43:28] from then the lord is that went out of
[43:30] god in the beginning become what we
[43:32] would call a theocra
[43:33] [Music]
[43:35] a
[43:36] supernatural body
[43:54] living in two dimensions
[43:56] while he was on this earth yeah yes amen
[44:00] it's really hard for people to solve
[44:01] that yes
[44:04] because you never even put you down on
[44:06] that brother's brothers yes yeah but
[44:08] they took the hand and fitted it exactly
[44:10] like a glove into them
[44:16] i don't want to say any more things
[44:17] because
[44:21] the spiritual body call you the holy
[44:23] spirit
[44:26] like devils want to work they work
[44:27] through your body yeah that's right so
[44:29] the holy spirit must work through it
[44:32] and the only way we know the holy spirit
[44:34] working through your body
[44:42] i think i'll call it
[44:49] i'm today thankful to be here

[1:00:26] our
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:34] you know sometimes
[1:00:36] even when you get emotional
[1:00:39] you think of the past
[1:00:44] and
[1:00:47] you know
[1:00:48] for men like these
[1:00:50] who stood the chest of times yes
[1:00:55] princess gospel
[1:00:57] night and day
[1:01:00] and you know
[1:01:01] i've heard pastor dan preaching many
[1:01:03] times
[1:01:06] but the first time
[1:01:08] i i i went to the service in united
[1:01:12] i just came into the message at the time
[1:01:15] and
[1:01:16] i was all bubbly and you know because
[1:01:20] it was something that we never had
[1:01:22] experienced in the denomination
[1:01:25] it was something that we always wanted
[1:01:28] you know if you if you had a desire for
[1:01:30] god
[1:01:31] there would be a desire in your heart
[1:01:33] amen
[1:01:34] you'll always be seeking because he says
[1:01:37] seek and you shall find amen and nothing
[1:01:40] can satisfy
[1:01:41] you
[1:01:42] if you're the seed of god nothing can
[1:01:44] satisfy you except you receive the word
[1:01:47] of god amen
[1:01:49] and
[1:01:50] the first day i came
[1:01:52] into this message
[1:01:54] and then i heard of so many names and
[1:01:56] stuff like that
[1:01:57] and the first time i came to pass the
[1:01:59] dance church
[1:02:00] you know i was so happy and
[1:02:03] you know
[1:02:04] it was in the classroom then unit three
[1:02:08] and uh i came with pastor jaggi
[1:02:12] and all of us were just basically new at
[1:02:14] that time
[1:02:16] and that pasta dan is so so right in
[1:02:18] saying that you know
[1:02:20] we never ceased we'll never cease to
[1:02:22] worship god
[1:02:24] because
[1:02:26] two o'clock in the morning you would be
[1:02:27] still sitting and talking
[1:02:29] the sisters will be so joyful making
[1:02:32] coffee and
[1:02:33] scones and the rest of the things you
[1:02:35] know and we would just go on time was
[1:02:37] like nothing for us
[1:02:40] we go to the beach in the night
[1:02:42] we will pray at the beach for the next
[1:02:44] morning service
[1:02:45] we go on the grounds and pray in the
[1:02:47] ground for the next morning service
[1:02:50] for the next day and you know
[1:02:52] like we never felt tired
[1:02:55] that's true four o'clock three year i
[1:02:57] used to get up like that and said i used
[1:02:59] to get up at four o'clock in the morning
[1:03:01] to go catch a train because we didn't
[1:03:03] have transport
[1:03:04] we also came from that same line in
[1:03:06] those days there were not rich people
[1:03:09] you know we had hard time like he said
[1:03:11] if you want a chicken
[1:03:13] you know
[1:03:14] that meant christmas came yeah
[1:03:16] if you had mutton
[1:03:18] or it made the easter came
[1:03:20] it was like that
[1:03:21] tin fish was our delicacy
[1:03:24] and you know i want to say i went the
[1:03:26] first time
[1:03:28] and i tell you i listened to that
[1:03:30] message
[1:03:32] it was
[1:03:33] just so touchy
[1:03:35] but before that message i got rebuked
[1:03:40] praise the lord amen you know
[1:03:43] if you cannot take a rebuke yeah
[1:03:46] then you must remember there's something
[1:03:47] wrong yeah
[1:03:49] and uh you know when you when you first
[1:03:51] come to the message and you think you're
[1:03:52] coming from the denomination
[1:03:55] you know and
[1:03:56] i want
[1:04:00] because
[1:04:02] you know you you're so so waked up now
[1:04:04] because you've got something new yeah
[1:04:06] you're like a child when you get a toy
[1:04:09] you know it's something new in you
[1:04:11] and you you you plan it and you start to
[1:04:14] want to to want to show other people you
[1:04:17] know
[1:04:18] and then
[1:04:19] i think i took some of pastor dan's time
[1:04:21] you know
[1:04:24] it took so long past the dance time so i
[1:04:27] sing a song i can
[1:04:29] still remember you know
[1:04:31] it was near them i got to leave you know
[1:04:33] and then the first man came to the pool
[1:04:36] and he says you know
[1:04:37] if you want to do an item
[1:04:39] you're really there at the deacon and
[1:04:42] the deacon will make you give an item
[1:04:47] and it was good yeah because when you
[1:04:49] read the message and you say that's
[1:04:50] exactly what the prophet said
[1:04:52] you know and we had a lot of experiences
[1:04:55] i don't know
[1:04:57] i mean all of us are getting old
[1:04:59] and you are 80 years my senior
[1:05:02] and i don't want to tell you my age
[1:05:06] so
[1:05:07] you know we used to go to bdc for the
[1:05:09] combined meetings
[1:05:10] and we had some good preachers
[1:05:12] so good men could really give us the
[1:05:15] word
[1:05:16] and pastor dan was one of them
[1:05:19] you know and we really cherish those
[1:05:21] days and and and
[1:05:23] and you know like like you said uh
[1:05:25] pastor ronnie got his ministry from him
[1:05:27] and i got my ministry from pastor ronnie
[1:05:30] so it's a chain and you are not left
[1:05:33] behind because all these preachers that
[1:05:35] have came they all came under your head
[1:05:37] and went on like you know that the
[1:05:39] prophet speaks about that man that was
[1:05:41] cutting the wood in the in the in the
[1:05:45] forest
[1:05:46] and he thought he was pretty this man
[1:05:48] was thought that he was preaching in the
[1:05:50] forest to the trees
[1:05:52] but when he got to the stadium
[1:05:55] it was another thing
[1:05:57] when that man mentioned this this
[1:05:59] experience that he had
[1:06:01] and then god told him
[1:06:03] that was your ministry
[1:06:05] ambassador we appreciate you
[1:06:08] and i'm on holiday
[1:06:11] but not on a holiday holy day
[1:06:14] i made it to a point
[1:06:16] they will come and meet you amen
[1:06:18] you know and and that's my desire with
[1:06:20] all the men of god i think there's only
[1:06:23] few of us left now
[1:06:25] very few of us are left
[1:06:26] and i said i came all the way
[1:06:28] from the south coast just to have this
[1:06:31] day with you and i want to say from the
[1:06:33] bottom of my heart
