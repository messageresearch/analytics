[1:32] everyone is well
[1:43] hey man I'd like to speak this morning
[1:46] on the angel of the Lord is on earth now
[1:49] amen amen amen
[1:52] that's a direct quote
[1:54] the angel of the Lord is on earth now
[1:58] amen
[2:00] Hallelujah we are fixing and moving into
[2:03] a time now forget about the
[2:05] commercialization of Christmas yes
[2:07] forget about all of those things Christ
[2:09] was born
[2:12] and the court goes on to say the angel
[2:14] of the Lord is on earth now fixing
[2:17] everything for the coming of the Lord
[2:21] amen everything
[2:23] now if you can see him working in Russia
[2:25] if you can see him working with the
[2:27] United Nations you can see him working
[2:28] with the Pope he is working with his
[2:31] people
[2:32] above measure than them
[2:35] because destruction is waiting to hit
[2:37] the earth and he must move us and fix us
[2:40] into a place
[2:41] where we are ready to leave the Earth
[2:44] a many many men so amen
[2:47] Hallelujah
[2:57] maybe asking something wrong am I
[2:59] missing something show me something in
[3:00] the scripture Jesus Christ just like our
[3:03] Elita was hunting a prophet is led by
[3:06] the angel of God amen amen I'm gonna
[3:10] read everything amen
[3:13] he's not coming before the bride
[3:17] and let's read from verse
[3:19] 27.
[3:27] amen
[3:29] listen Lord
[3:36] that's the Abraham
[3:38] were not left destitute my master of his
[3:41] mercy and his truth I being in the way
[3:44] the Lord led me to the house of my
[3:46] Master's brethren
[3:50] and the dancer ran and told her mother's
[3:52] house these things
[3:54] so she's running back
[3:56] amen and it came to pass
[3:59] when he saw the earrings and bracelets
[4:02] upon his sister's hands and when he
[4:04] heard the words of Rebecca's sister
[4:06] saying that's the man
[4:08] does make the manner to me that
[4:11] came unto the man and behold
[4:14] well and he said come in
[4:18] it's not without for I am
[4:22] for the camels
[4:25] I'm trying to get to the point where I
[4:28] want to read okay let's go to verse 40.
[4:30] so now Abraham is trying to explain
[4:32] Eliza is trying to explain today's
[4:33] journey and all of these things this is
[4:35] the verse I want to get to and he's
[4:37] telling Laban and the bread now he's
[4:38] telling the denominations
[4:41] right that's what he's doing because
[4:42] what did Rebecca try to do initially she
[4:45] told him in verse 25 we have enough
[4:48] straw and preventing enough and room to
[4:50] for you to Lodge him she was trying to
[4:52] get Elisa to join the lodge all right to
[4:55] come in and take part of the
[4:56] denominational affair
[4:58] but he said let the woman become with me
[5:01] release her immediately
[5:03] so then they go now and they asked the
[5:05] brother and now in verse 40 we read this
[5:08] and he said unto me the Lord before whom
[5:11] I walk will send his angel with thee and
[5:14] prosper thy way and thou shall take your
[5:16] wife my son of my king
[5:19] and of
[5:20] house
[5:22] right so they
[5:24] the Lord sending that is a very you may
[5:27] be Civic sorry amen a very important
[5:30] scripture
[5:32] because it's deep
[5:35] [Music]
[5:39] the exact same scene
[5:41] Jesus Christ again sent a prophet a
[5:45] mighty prophet in this age to hunt him a
[5:48] bride
[5:50] one that's coming out of
[5:51] denominationalism one out of the latest
[5:53] Union Church age
[5:55] okay now we're going to background this
[5:58] and we're going to show you
[6:00] amen
[6:02] how the angel of the Lord fixed things
[6:05] for the first coming
[6:08] amen because we are at the second coming
[6:12] no the angel of the Lord
[6:15] remember four to five hundred years at
[6:18] the past since Malachi's prophecy
[6:20] that I'm going to send
[6:22] Elijah the prophet
[6:24] so four to five hundred years passes by
[6:27] and they silence
[6:30] no moving of God
[6:33] nothing
[6:36] but suddenly the angel of God comes to a
[6:39] priest in the temple
[6:42] Zacharias
[6:44] now remember God always has a nature and
[6:48] the way he does things
[6:51] so this is the same yesterday today and
[6:53] forever
[6:54] because he could have allowed Mary and
[6:58] Elizabeth to produce children without
[7:00] informing them or telling them anything
[7:04] the Holy Ghost could have been
[7:06] overshadowed Mary
[7:09] she would have wanted on Earth did I get
[7:11] pregnant
[7:12] he didn't have to reveal and fix things
[7:15] for the first coming of the Lord
[7:17] but the angel of the Lord appeared and
[7:19] was fixing things for the coming of the
[7:21] Lord
[7:24] so he comes to Zechariah in the temple
[7:26] and he tells him that Elizabeth is going
[7:29] to be a son
[7:31] first he's fixing the Forerunner hmm
[7:35] amen he's setting into motion because
[7:39] John the Baptist was a son of man
[7:43] and when he's standing at the bench of
[7:45] Jordan he's revealing thee son of man
[7:47] Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away
[7:49] the sins of the world
[7:52] so he is fixing things he's coming to
[7:54] zechariah's in the temple and he's
[7:56] revealing to him that you're going to
[7:58] have a son Elizabeth in our old age is
[8:00] going to Bear son
[8:02] and you're going to call his name John
[8:06] and he gives them a sign because
[8:08] Zechariah didn't believe it he said
[8:10] you're going to go down
[8:12] right I'm trying to refresh your memory
[8:14] with all of these events but it's the
[8:16] angel of the Lord fixing things for the
[8:19] first coming
[8:20] then he comes to Mary
[8:22] Angel of the Lord comes to Mary
[8:25] and he greets her you know he greets a
[8:27] hell Mary
[8:29] blessed are thou amongst all women
[8:31] and he tells her
[8:33] now what is this he is modern events are
[8:37] going to be made clear by prophecy
[8:40] the angel coming to Mary was a modern
[8:42] day event
[8:44] but he's going to make it clear by
[8:47] bringing to pass a zionized prophecy
[8:49] that a virgin shall conceive
[8:51] [Music]
[8:53] amen
[8:55] Now watch how the angel of the Lord
[8:57] appears in different ways to different
[8:59] people he comes to zecharias in the
[9:01] temple
[9:02] he comes to Mary physically
[9:05] but do you know the angel of the Lord
[9:07] can appear to you in another form
[9:10] because the angel of the Lord came to
[9:12] Joseph in a dream
[9:16] okay you'll find that in Matthew 1 20.
[9:19] it says while he thought of these things
[9:21] the angel of the Lord appeared upon him
[9:24] in a dream saying Joseph thou son of
[9:26] David fear not to take unto thee marry
[9:29] thy wife for death which is conceived in
[9:32] her is of the Holy Ghost
[9:35] now yes we really need to get spiritual
[9:39] it's because we are going to bed
[9:41] dreaming about the KFC that we got left
[9:44] over in the fridge and now we nobody
[9:46] else must take it when we wake up in the
[9:48] morning
[9:52] if we want to experience the spiritual
[9:54] things of God we must anticipate it yes
[9:58] did you have you got all the scripture
[10:00] what does it start with
[10:03] while he taught on these things
[10:07] you're going to bed young men and you're
[10:09] thinking I wish I get a chance to kiss
[10:11] this girl
[10:14] maybe kiss is going too extreme right we
[10:16] don't believe in kissing
[10:19] maybe I wish I get a number a phone
[10:21] number
[10:22] but what is Joseph thinking about
[10:26] amen why he thought on these things
[10:30] amen
[10:31] behold the angel of the Lord appeared to
[10:34] him no doubt other angels can appear to
[10:36] you if you think on worldly things
[10:39] they are demon Spirits they are Fallen
[10:42] Angels you think on worldly things those
[10:45] demon powers will come to you as well
[10:46] they'll come to you in a dream as well
[10:49] they'll come to oppress you sometimes
[10:51] they come and try and choke you
[10:53] know
[10:55] amen
[10:57] so we're watching the nature of this
[10:59] Angel and the way he was fixing and
[11:02] moving things for the first coming of
[11:04] the Lord
[11:06] so notice now we said he is appearing to
[11:09] them physically he's appearing to them
[11:11] in a dream
[11:12] amen
[11:13] then we learn
[11:16] that he also
[11:19] can appear and reveal something to you
[11:22] personally that's not even in Scripture
[11:25] [Music]
[11:27] you will have no scriptural backing to
[11:30] tell the world exactly that you're
[11:32] waiting for the coming of the Lord
[11:34] and my type for that is similar in the
[11:36] temple
[11:38] Simeon had a personal word from the Lord
[11:41] that you will not see death until you
[11:44] see the Lord's Christ
[11:46] amen
[11:47] he had no scriptural begging to tell him
[11:50] hey get into the scripture I'm not gonna
[11:52] die
[11:53] it was revealed to him personally amen
[11:57] the same way this message is revealed to
[11:59] you personally that this is your
[12:01] guaranteed ticket out of this world
[12:05] how do you know this message is going to
[12:08] take you out and give your body change
[12:09] it's been revealed to me personally I
[12:12] shall not see death until I have my body
[12:15] changed
[12:17] amen thank you amen many many men
[12:21] oh bless the name of the Lord amen
[12:24] hallelujah
[12:26] now we know the angel of the Lord is
[12:29] fixing things and then he sends them on
[12:32] the way with these messages
[12:34] one is going to conceive of the holy
[12:36] ghost Elizabeth is going to conceive
[12:40] yes Simeon he's not going to see death
[12:42] till he sees the Christ also Anna in the
[12:45] temple all waiting for the coming but
[12:49] the angel is fixing things
[12:53] now it comes to pass
[12:56] that Elizabeth conceives
[12:58] she Bears John
[13:02] and six months later
[13:04] here Jesus is born
[13:07] our lord Jesus you know the story how he
[13:09] is born in a sinking stable
[13:12] but watch how they now watch how the the
[13:14] angel is moving and fixing things he
[13:17] wants Jesus to be born in Bethlehem
[13:19] amen so he raises up a decree
[13:23] he causes a political disturbance
[13:26] you watch how the angel is fixing things
[13:28] now because of the a a a religious
[13:32] disturbance a political disturbance that
[13:35] they must go into a specific every man
[13:37] was going to the town that he was born
[13:38] to be taxed
[13:41] amen but it's still the same Angel
[13:43] fixing things amen amen
[13:46] so now they leave and they go to
[13:48] Bethlehem
[13:51] then Jesus is born in a stable
[13:55] it was the angel who fixed that there
[13:56] wasn't any room in the Inn right because
[13:59] he needed the lamb to be born where
[14:00] Lambs are born
[14:03] amen
[14:04] the same angel that fixed that appeared
[14:07] to the shepherds in the field
[14:10] and what was the shepherd's message
[14:13] when they finally went
[14:15] the Bible says they went through the
[14:17] stable and they saw the Lord's Christ
[14:20] over there
[14:22] brother Brandon preaches why it had to
[14:24] be Shepherds
[14:25] only Shepherds could identify the lamb
[14:28] amen
[14:29] high priest would not want to go down to
[14:32] that stinking
[14:34] stable
[14:36] it would have been too undignified for
[14:38] him to go there
[14:40] he would have said I am a priest that
[14:42] must be adorned in in the most glorious
[14:44] apparel of the day and no unclean thing
[14:46] must touch me because I need to go into
[14:48] Temple worship
[14:51] so it had to take shepherds in the field
[14:53] who knew how to identify lamb
[14:56] [Music]
[14:57] amen amen he was not afraid of that
[14:59] smell
[15:01] and when they saw it the Bible says the
[15:04] Shepherds got to work and they began to
[15:05] testify and tell them around
[15:09] of this great and glorious events
[15:11] and why what was the angel what was the
[15:14] shepherd's message the prophet tells us
[15:16] their message was Messiah is on earth
[15:19] now amen amen
[15:22] they began to Proclaim that message this
[15:26] Messiah that you are looking for
[15:28] the great deliverer is on earth now the
[15:32] one that Moses prophesied is on earth
[15:35] now it was a modern day event and they
[15:37] were making it clear by Vindicated
[15:39] prophecy
[15:41] but the message was not heard
[15:43] by the religious people
[15:45] we find two years later wise men
[15:48] following the star Jesus is now two
[15:50] years old
[15:51] they inquiring they're making an
[15:53] announcement where is he born King of
[15:56] the Jews
[15:58] no doubt this message was alarming to
[16:00] everything and the religious leaders and
[16:03] even probably the citizens of the
[16:06] country because they were unaware that
[16:08] the promised Messiah was on Earth at the
[16:11] time amen what is all this commotion
[16:14] what is all this noise
[16:17] talking about a messiah
[16:22] amen
[16:25] but here they are
[16:27] angel of God fixing things throws up a
[16:30] star leads the wise men
[16:32] all the way to Jesus
[16:34] and you know that they offer him
[16:37] amen gold frankincense and Mum
[16:44] now along the way we tried to get to
[16:46] this point on Wednesday
[16:48] that we should never stop and put a full
[16:50] stop when God is fixing things
[16:53] and moving us to take us away from this
[16:55] Earth
[16:55] [Music]
[16:58] amen
[17:01] Mary could have denominated around the
[17:03] idea
[17:06] when Jesus was born in that stable
[17:09] that this is the coming of the Lord and
[17:12] put a full stop right there
[17:15] but Jesus in a in a form of a baby was
[17:18] not what was prophesied
[17:20] when I'm talking about Redeeming the
[17:22] world
[17:24] paying the price for Redemption he
[17:25] wasn't going to do it as a baby
[17:29] but that was the first process of the
[17:31] coming of the Lord
[17:34] amen follow my thought now
[17:37] when he was two years old those wise men
[17:39] could have denominated form the
[17:41] denomination we have found the Messiah
[17:43] this is the coming of the Lord they
[17:46] could have denominated around that idea
[17:51] when they found him preaching in the
[17:53] temple at 12 years old
[17:55] wasn't all this the coming of the Lord
[17:58] 12 years old he's still preaching they
[18:01] could have denominated and said look at
[18:02] the 12 year old boy such intelligence
[18:05] such Brilliance to know the scriptures
[18:06] let's form a denomination
[18:09] he has already come
[18:11] yes
[18:13] amen
[18:14] amen
[18:15] John at the Jordan River when Jesus is a
[18:18] 30 year old man
[18:21] coming and he's saying Behold the Lamb
[18:23] of God John could have said I saw the
[18:25] spirit of God descend upon him I
[18:28] baptized him in fact John tried to start
[18:31] his own denomination the Apostle Paul
[18:34] who came to set the church in order had
[18:36] to find those disciples and re-baptize
[18:38] them
[18:42] because they tried to denominate around
[18:44] an idea
[18:46] John was baptizing
[18:48] unto repentance
[18:51] amen
[18:55] amen they could have said in those days
[18:57] the disciples we have seen him Healing
[19:00] The Sick raising the dead turning water
[19:02] into wine they could have been content
[19:04] with any content amen with any of those
[19:07] stages of Jesus ministry and denominated
[19:09] around it but the complete work of
[19:11] redemption pertaining to the first
[19:13] coming had to be completed
[19:17] what am I telling you there were stages
[19:19] to the first coming yeah
[19:24] amen once the high priest of Israel and
[19:27] the scribes and the Pharisees were
[19:29] preaching Isaiah 9 that a virgin shall
[19:32] conceive the Virgin had already
[19:33] conceived
[19:35] they were preaching it as a future
[19:36] prophecy an event waiting to unfold
[19:40] but this scripture was already fulfilled
[19:42] and it was Now history
[19:45] the Messiah was on Earth
[19:47] amen the first coming was in process
[19:50] everything was that was supposed to
[19:52] happen amen was unfolding
[19:54] he came as a baby he was born amen into
[19:58] this world through a virgin amen the
[20:00] Angel's message declaring that the
[20:02] Messiah is born was not the end of the
[20:05] first coming it's the start or the
[20:07] beginning of the unfolding revelation of
[20:09] the first coming
[20:12] amen Jesus at the temple also didn't
[20:15] tell them put a full stop here when he's
[20:17] reading his eyes 61 that the spirit of
[20:19] the Lord is upon me
[20:21] yes yes amen
[20:25] amen
[20:28] I would like you to when you're talking
[20:30] about redemption's plan there's only one
[20:33] Redemption plan
[20:35] because people get mixed up when you
[20:36] talk about comings
[20:39] it is one Lord Jesus Christ fulfilling
[20:42] the complete Redemption plan
[20:46] okay
[20:48] that's all you got to know
[20:51] he came into the world you know the
[20:52] three times he comes he came to redeem
[20:55] then he comes to take away
[20:57] and then he's coming back with
[21:00] amen
[21:02] so we find here
[21:05] Jesus didn't put a full stop at his eyes
[21:07] 61 he had to go all the way to the cross
[21:12] he had to be resurrected as proof
[21:14] proof Ministry
[21:18] [Music]
[21:19] could have been just a boast yes
[21:25] but he had to prove and back up his word
[21:27] when he said destroy this Temple and in
[21:30] three days I'll raise it up he could
[21:32] have just been opposed
[21:34] didn't the bible say that the other men
[21:36] came and took People Into the Wilderness
[21:37] and they were boasting that they were
[21:39] the Messiah
[21:40] they were final impression Nations
[21:42] rising up
[21:43] amen but early that Easter morning
[21:45] between six and nine amen amen
[21:48] hallelujah there was a Jew sunrise and
[21:51] the SOA Rose from the grave to prove his
[21:54] word
[21:56] amen so true I'm using that as a type
[21:59] and I'm finishing the type now so too
[22:02] the second coming of the Lord has been
[22:04] unfolding
[22:06] the Rapture is a process and the
[22:09] unfolding revelation of the shout the
[22:11] voice and the trumpet of God is still
[22:13] unfolding before us
[22:17] amen
[22:20] blessed be the name of the Lord
[22:22] amen
[22:24] or is worthy to be praised and adored
[22:27] amen
[22:28] now we find a great and glorious event
[22:32] starts the cycle of the second coming
[22:38] amen how does it start
[22:41] there's a lapse again
[22:43] a period of Silence
[22:47] from Azusa Street
[22:49] and then there's no move of God
[22:54] and so one day
[22:56] April
[22:59] amen
[23:00] five o'clock in the morning
[23:05] a baby is born
[23:07] event
[23:09] a type of John the Baptist
[23:12] and the angel of God comes down like to
[23:14] pull our fire into the room
[23:17] to be identified with his prophet
[23:21] amen
[23:23] and he doesn't leave him he's fixing
[23:25] things he's got to have a holy
[23:27] consecrated prophet
[23:30] so as the boy is growing the angel of
[23:33] the Lord comes in a whirlwind in a tree
[23:35] one is carrying water as a
[23:37] seven-year-old boy and he tells him do
[23:39] not drink do not smoke do not commit
[23:41] adultery or defile your body in any way
[23:44] for when you grow up I have a work for
[23:46] you to do
[23:47] what is the angel doing fixing things
[23:50] as a young man when he's tempted to take
[23:52] that cigarette I would take that bottle
[23:54] and drink he would hear that angel come
[23:56] shhh
[23:58] do not smoke
[23:59] do not drink defile your body in any way
[24:03] when you grow older I have a walk for
[24:05] you to do
[24:07] amen so all through his life
[24:10] is hearing the angel of the Lord fixing
[24:12] things
[24:13] preparing for what the coming of the
[24:16] Lord
[24:17] he needs a consecrated vessel
[24:20] because this is a great mystery
[24:24] that son of man was going to be revealed
[24:27] through a human body
[24:29] [Music]
[24:30] God was going to take this man
[24:33] and use him to such an extent
[24:36] that he would confound
[24:38] the religious leaders do you know
[24:40] besides you and I they do not understand
[24:42] his ministry they think he was A Gifted
[24:45] Man which he was
[24:48] but even they testified that there's
[24:50] nobody else who operated in this level
[24:53] they do not understand the son of man
[24:56] was in operation
[24:58] veiled behind a son of man
[25:03] amen
[25:06] so we were looking at now we come to our
[25:09] message
[25:11] are we saying the angel of the Lord is
[25:13] on earth now
[25:17] we know the cycle of the Rapture starts
[25:19] with a shout
[25:22] brother Grandma tell us what is a shout
[25:25] it's a message going forth
[25:29] to gather the living things
[25:33] how is the message coming now this is
[25:35] not a message of a seventh grade
[25:37] education man
[25:39] it's a message from almighty God
[25:42] the world don't know it but the cycle of
[25:45] the Rapture started when Revelation 10
[25:47] was fulfilled
[25:49] Amen brother Branham tells us that the
[25:52] setting of the scene of the seventh seal
[25:54] is found in Revelation 10. when this
[25:57] Mighty Angel descends from heaven
[26:05] amen this Mighty Angels descends from
[26:08] heaven with an open book with a message
[26:11] with a shout
[26:13] you need to go and read now I think uh
[26:15] says is this the time you need to go
[26:17] read on the wings of a snow white dove
[26:19] you need to go read the seventh seal to
[26:21] understand the property saying the
[26:23] message I've been waiting for all my
[26:24] life
[26:25] he's down at the Ohio river and he hears
[26:28] a voice
[26:29] as John the Baptist was sent to forerun
[26:31] my first coming your message will
[26:33] forerun the second coming so from that
[26:35] was 1933 1933 to 1960 he had no message
[26:40] yet
[26:43] 60 to 63 no message yet until this event
[26:47] happens
[26:50] then he's got a message
[26:54] the opening of the word the revelation
[26:57] of the Seven Seals and he tells you
[26:59] night after night an angel came to me
[27:05] amen if night after night an angel came
[27:08] to me how many seals were there
[27:11] quickly enough
[27:13] Seven Seals how many nights were there
[27:16] seven nights so how many angels appeared
[27:19] to him
[27:22] amen
[27:27] seven angels
[27:31] I'm trying to give you a clue if you can
[27:33] understand what I'm telling you
[27:37] when this Mighty angel
[27:40] Roars like a lion
[27:44] what does the Bible says
[27:46] seven funders uttered their voices
[27:52] is that the scripture
[27:54] amen nobody can identify who those seven
[27:57] Thunders were shame
[28:00] even message people who claim to be
[28:02] going in a Rapture don't know who those
[28:03] seven pandas were
[28:06] when the prophet is clearly telling us
[28:08] these things
[28:10] amen the prophet is telling us in the
[28:12] message
[28:16] but you want it like
[28:21] you want a spoon fed too you don't want
[28:23] to search out the message
[28:25] you don't want to go and read
[28:27] amen let's read now in a time of
[28:31] decision
[28:32] paragraph 27 we'll find here he says now
[28:35] he's taking this type of elieza
[28:37] and he's telling them there
[28:40] it was evening time when he came to the
[28:43] well near the city
[28:45] and it was about that time that Rebecca
[28:47] had to make a decision
[28:51] and he says I believe the angel of the
[28:53] Lord beat him there about half an hour
[28:58] no no
[28:59] I believe the angel of the Lord
[29:02] beat him there about half an hour how
[29:06] long did the clouds stay up
[29:08] amen
[29:11] was it there before the prophet was
[29:12] there
[29:14] amen amen
[29:16] [Music]
[29:18] come now be spiritual
[29:21] be spiritual about these things
[29:24] I believe the angel of the Lord beat him
[29:26] there about half an hour
[29:32] amen
[29:34] firstly to drive over all and believe in
[29:37] the campus morning
[29:40] how many of you believe let's go back to
[29:42] the cloud picture
[29:44] that that's the angel of the Lord
[29:46] what form that cloud
[29:49] seven angels
[29:51] form the hand of Christ he says the
[29:54] seven angels himself was his wig
[29:58] so we know without a shadow of a doubt
[30:02] that with the mighty angel
[30:04] comes seven angels amen
[30:09] [Music]
[30:10] amen
[30:12] some of you feel like you're in higher
[30:13] grade class this morning amen
[30:17] Hallelujah but I want you to know this
[30:19] is the level you ought to be at these
[30:21] things are we ought to know these things
[30:23] it's the most important message
[30:26] denominations cannot preach this message
[30:30] the angel of the Lord is on earth now
[30:33] this was the start of him coming down to
[30:35] the Earth
[30:37] amen
[30:39] so he says he will send his angels
[30:42] before you and make the way clear now
[30:43] listen he says it must have been the
[30:45] angel of God that spoke to Rebecca's
[30:48] heart
[30:50] amen
[30:52] I don't know but in the same scripture
[30:53] Revelation 10 I'm finding an angel of
[30:56] God speak to John amen
[31:01] sing
[31:04] take the book yeah
[31:06] eat the book
[31:10] the same one is telling you how the
[31:13] angel fixed Rebecca's heart to receive
[31:15] Eliza's message is the same one that
[31:17] spoke to us to take Brandon's message
[31:20] amen amen
[31:24] do you think it's because we are smart
[31:26] and educated and we we are super
[31:27] intelligent that we took Brandon's
[31:29] message
[31:30] the angel of God said and he fixed it
[31:35] this is the Vindicated prophet of the
[31:37] age
[31:38] amen let me tell you that's where many
[31:41] people have a problem
[31:43] because if you can accept the prophet of
[31:45] the age you won't have a problem
[31:47] accepting his teaching yes you cannot
[31:50] sympathize with the message
[31:52] and accept certain teachings of the
[31:54] message and finding hard to swallow
[31:55] because you have doubt about the
[31:57] messenger
[31:58] Amen in spiritual food in due season the
[32:01] prophet is telling you the messenger and
[32:03] the message is won yes amen
[32:06] amen that is why it's easy for us to
[32:09] believe that he's the seventh angel
[32:10] message to believe every word that he
[32:12] spoke without doubting or questioning
[32:18] so it must have been the angel of God
[32:20] that spoke to Rebecca's heart and told
[32:22] her go get the water
[32:24] and Rebecca came to the Water of Life at
[32:27] evening time
[32:28] [Music]
[32:29] amen
[32:31] now watch he says here it's the time
[32:33] that the angel of the Lord in his
[32:36] Supernatural is revealing himself to the
[32:39] Rebecca the Bride of Isaac he's saying
[32:42] it's time now
[32:45] it's the time the angel of the Lord in
[32:47] his Supernatural is revealing himself to
[32:50] the Rebecca the Bride of Isaac

[32:55] watch you say where is the Angel of the
[32:57] Lord show me
[32:59] yes brother Branham the angels of the
[33:02] Lord the angel singular the angel of the
[33:05] Lord is in the message
[33:08] but I reject the message
[33:10] who you rejecting
[33:14] some of you are cutting the angel of the
[33:15] Lord
[33:16] yeah every week you're cutting it
[33:21] Angel of the Lord you're cutting him

[33:52] Rebecca to come to the Waters of life
[33:54] amen yes moving up the spiritual
[33:58] Supernatural amen that's what it is
[34:02] amen so the angel of the Lord that's no
[34:05] different because if you know who the
[34:06] angel of the Lord is that's no different
[34:09] from saying if you blaspheme the Holy
[34:11] Ghost because the angel of the Lord
[34:13] hears the Holy Ghost amen
[34:16] yes
[34:17] that we are not unitarians we don't
[34:20] believe the angel of the Lord is God
[34:21] Almighty and then we got a Holy Ghost
[34:23] and then we got a father and then we got
[34:24] a son

[48:55] refreshing comes the presence of God
[48:57] shall bathe their hearts Souls bring
[49:00] them unto their new life A New Hope let
[49:03] the angel of God who has been sent
[49:05] before the message speak the blood
[49:08] relation that's been bought by the
[49:11] precious Christ
[49:12] [Music]
[49:15] don't miss that point now he says let

[49:45] Christ amen
[49:48] now watch he comes denominational world
[49:51] don't know about a shout a voice and a
[49:54] trump being a process over a time and it
[49:57] starts with a prophet's message
[49:59] starts with the angel coming down to
[50:01] give the prophet a message
[50:03] because before Revelation 10 7 is
[50:06] revelation 10 1. the mighty angel coming
[50:09] down he's the one that reveals the
[50:11] mystery secrets to Revelation 10 7. yes
[50:14] we take it now from Revelation 10 7 and
[50:18] we are prophesying again
[50:20] but they don't know that Revelation 10 1
[50:22] was the shout
[50:25] right
[50:27] they don't know that it started in 1963.
[50:31] I said started in 1963.
[50:35] not finished
[50:38] yet the prophet of God will go on to say
[50:40] now we commend them to thee
[50:43] that are at the meeting time
[50:45] when the church meets Jesus
[50:47] in the way
[50:51] and we believe that
[50:53] is already left the father's house
[50:58] and he's on the road to the Earth
[51:00] he does all three things as he's
[51:02] descending
[51:03] right
[51:07] why are you going quiet you don't like
[51:09] the prophet
[51:12] he's already left the father's house
[51:15] and he's on his Road
[51:17] yes he's on his way
[51:22] and he's in the fields of the great
[51:23] beyond
[51:25] out in the fields meditating and the
[51:28] bride making herself ready and soon
[51:31] should be on her way
[51:33] [Music]
[51:35] the scripture says that we'll meet the
[51:37] Lord in the way amen
[51:39] [Music]
[51:41] somebody will only meet him in the world
[51:47] the scripture says that we'll meet the
[51:48] Lord in the way
[51:50] he's already left and coming after his
[51:53] right let us be ready for this may be
[51:56] the last call the evening time is here I
[51:59] commit them unto their hands and I keep
[52:01] him Lord
[52:02] through Jesus Christ we ask it and give
[52:05] to you the tokens of the message now
[52:09] that's what we are right the tokens of
[52:10] the message
[52:12] amen so if you clock that last point
[52:15] there the prophet says that Jesus had
[52:17] left the father's house already and he
[52:19] started to make his descent he shall
[52:21] descend with a shout
[52:23] so he's descending with a shout
[52:27] and then he said the bride is making
[52:28] herself ready
[52:30] now we're going to go to amen another
[52:32] message here
[52:35] the marriage of the Lamb
[52:38] or maybe we can just go to my slide I
[52:40] think we'll find a day easier paragraph
[52:42] 53 he says we know that there's going to
[52:45] be a bride there's going to be a wedding
[52:46] supper served in the skies that's a sure
[52:49] to be as God is
[52:51] right we know that those things are
[52:54] going to make up that bride is going to
[52:55] be his church
[52:57] they're going to appear before him
[52:59] without spots and wrinkle now here's the
[53:01] point I want to get to
[53:03] let's move up this slide
[53:05] he says they have the material
[53:09] on earth now
[53:13] let's get up to the next slide amen if
[53:15] you got the quote you can get go to the
[53:16] court and move to the next slide amen
[53:19] I need to get this point how do you make
[53:21] yourself ready he says
[53:26] they have the material on earth now
[53:30] to make themselves ready
[53:33] if you notice it said she made herself
[53:36] ready
[53:39] hmm
[53:40] let me ask you another way do you do you
[53:43] have we need to move past it sliding man
[53:45] I think uh just back
[53:51] No No Yeah there isn't there and they
[53:53] have the material on earth now to make
[53:56] themselves ready
[53:57] if you notice it she made herself ready
[54:00] so I'm asking you do you have the
[54:03] material
[54:04] the message of the hour are you using it
[54:07] to make yourself ready amen
[54:09] okay good that you answered 9 54 if you
[54:13] got that quote I want to get to this
[54:15] because this is more
[54:16] to encourage you
[54:19] that sometimes you want to leave things
[54:21] first and we want to fix our lives first
[54:23] and you know many people say that oh
[54:25] when I make myself write to the Lord
[54:26] then I'll serve him
[54:28] yeah you're the prophet now so many says
[54:31] if the Lord will take this evil spirit
[54:33] from me from drinking or scambling from
[54:35] lying or stealing I'll serve him
[54:38] he says but that's up to you
[54:41] you've got to do something
[54:45] a day that will overcome shall he never
[54:48] to all things
[54:49] they must overcome
[54:51] so you are waiting for the Lord to take
[54:53] away drinking you are waiting for the
[54:55] Lord to take away gambling he says You
[54:57] must do something
[54:59] [Music]
[55:01] because you've got to overcome
[55:04] you've got to apply the token
[55:06] you've got to invite the Holy Ghost in
[55:09] amen
[55:12] he says you have the power to do it but
[55:15] you must be willing to lay it down
[55:17] [Music]
[55:19] she has made herself ready
[55:21] he says I like that word
[55:23] you see God could not push us through a
[55:25] little pipe put us out the other end
[55:28] and then say blessed is he that
[55:30] overcometh
[55:32] then you have nothing to overcome he
[55:34] just pushed you through
[55:35] but you have got to make a decision for
[55:38] yourself
[55:39] I have to make decisions for myself in
[55:42] doing that we show our faith and
[55:44] respects to God Amen
[55:47] Abraham was promised a child but he must
[55:50] maintain This Promise for 25 years the
[55:53] ups and the Downs that he had the
[55:55] Temptations in those 25 years but he
[55:58] held to hell to the promise
[56:00] oh glory be to God
[56:03] some of us have been holding on longer
[56:07] some of us have been holding on to the
[56:08] promise for 40 years
[56:11] amen
[56:12] we always admire the faith of Abraham
[56:15] but look how long you've been in in this
[56:17] world and in year in the shout and
[56:20] waiting for the promise coming of the
[56:22] Lord amen waiting for the going away of
[56:24] the church waiting for the body change
[56:27] your years have passed 25 years
[56:30] you've had your ups and downs like
[56:32] Abraham amen you've had your Temptations
[56:35] but you're holding on to the promise of
[56:37] the world Amen
[56:41] he says in 58 Israel was promised that
[56:44] Promised Land but they had to fight for
[56:46] every inch of ground
[56:48] whatsoever The Souls of your foot tread
[56:50] that have I given you
[56:53] God said to Joshua the land was there
[56:55] God gave it to them but they must fight
[56:57] for it
[57:00] thank you
[57:01] the whole Windows of Heaven is full of
[57:04] Bountiful blessings but some of you need
[57:06] to open up the windows
[57:09] how you open it up by praying but
[57:12] trusting the Lord
[57:14] fight for every inch of ground
[57:17] it says that's the same way it is about
[57:19] Divine Healing God has got the power to
[57:22] heal you
[57:23] if you've got the courage to accept it
[57:25] [Music]
[57:27] but you'll have to fight every inch of
[57:29] the way
[57:31] God has got Amazing Grace to save you he
[57:33] will do it but you'll fight every inch
[57:36] of your way
[57:37] he says I've been behind the pulpit
[57:39] going on 31 years and every inch of that
[57:42] has been a fight constantly it certainly
[57:45] has
[57:46] we must fight if we must Reign so we
[57:49] find that the bride has to make herself
[57:51] ready be willing to lay aside every
[57:54] weight
[57:55] that those so easily beset us
[57:57] we must run with patience yeah in the
[58:00] message a calm down next slide he says
[58:02] Christ is on earth now
[58:05] in the form of the holy spirit in its
[58:08] fullness trying to get you away from

[59:01] you'll find this in the message of the
[59:03] ten virgins and the 144 000.
[59:06] he says in paragraph 94
[59:09] amen
[59:11] the angel of the Lord is on earth now
[59:16] is moving around fixing everything for
[59:19] the coming of the Lord
[59:24] and it's the same angels that heard the
[59:28] sin
[59:31] it's the same Angels that's heard the
[59:33] sin when they went down to Sodom
[59:36] so these angels haven't aged
[59:39] the same one that went back there is the
[59:41] same one that's here today
[59:43] now notice only one Angel went
[59:48] stayed with Abraham
[59:51] one stayed with Abraham and the elect
[59:54] in 9605 but the angel that stood with
[59:57] Abraham at his back turned to the tent
[59:59] we've had that same sign yes yes when
[1:00:02] you're seeing this Prophet turn his back
[1:00:03] and discern the hearts it's the angel of
[1:00:05] the Lord
[1:00:07] don't be fascinated and think it's a
[1:00:08] Gifted Man it's the angel of the Lord be
[1:00:11] able to identify who it is
[1:00:14] man it's the angel of the Lord
[1:00:17] the one he says how did he know when
[1:00:19] Abraham was married how did he know
[1:00:21] Sarah's name how did he know he had a
[1:00:23] wife
[1:00:24] amen
[1:00:26] he says well I've made you a promise
[1:00:29] you see who the angel was I made you a
[1:00:32] promise I am going to visit you
[1:00:34] according to the time of life
[1:00:36] who is this Angel we're talking about
[1:00:41] seeing the sign he gave to the elect
[1:00:43] Church
[1:00:44] now watching 101 he says a striking
[1:00:46] thing here
[1:00:48] he says look we've had all of these
[1:00:50] great ministers he says after Billy
[1:00:52] Graham received the Holy Ghost
[1:00:56] he did not come into here he didn't come
[1:00:58] into the message
[1:01:02] yes you know after Billy Graham received
[1:01:05] the Holy Ghost he could not come out
[1:01:07] into here
[1:01:09] he's talking about the message of the
[1:01:10] hour it's reserved for the deserved
[1:01:14] even a great bear like Bully Graham
[1:01:17] couldn't come into the message of the
[1:01:19] hour yes
[1:01:20] amen
[1:01:23] he says that's his feel down there
[1:01:28] and he recognizes it
[1:01:30] and God is holding there
[1:01:35] amen even if they wanted to it's only
[1:01:38] for the predestinator all that the
[1:01:41] father has given me will come to me
[1:01:45] that's powerful yes
[1:01:48] amen but in one or two he says here was
[1:01:51] Abraham and his class
[1:01:53] and Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:01:56] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:01:58] the son of man in 103 he says see those
[1:02:01] angels will be here on Earth doing the
[1:02:04] same thing
[1:02:05] that's what they're doing right now
[1:02:08] you see

[1:06:42] embrace the message with all of your
[1:06:44] heart yes the word coming was the most
[1:06:46] important coming that we could have had
[1:06:48] to prepare us for the rapture
[1:06:50] but it's not the end we don't put a full
[1:06:52] stop amen
[1:06:54] without the message of the hour without
[1:06:56] the spoken word without the message amen
[1:06:58] the shout

[1:08:21] in
[1:08:24] if he was really serious about his
[1:08:26] healing
[1:08:27] he would have waded in the water
[1:08:31] because he knew the angels of the Lord
[1:08:33] comes around a specific time in a season
[1:08:37] take many many men
