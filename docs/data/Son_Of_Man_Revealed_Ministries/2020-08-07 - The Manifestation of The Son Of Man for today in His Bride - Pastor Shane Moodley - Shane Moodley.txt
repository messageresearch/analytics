sustain the house of your children man tonight father that's your word baby abetting drown in that soul to bring from that which you have purposed before the foundation of their soul into this time o God that you've called us thank you now we are working that rapturing faith it was in a mighty Bhima for Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen we went attend to our Bibles to the book of first Peter one where's Trinity yeah the Bible tells us that seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit and two unsaved loved see that you love one another with a pure heart in February my beautiful reverently he we know in that in the age that the Prophet was speaking about the desire the desire of serving God right and he says a Fablab desire to please God a cry to reach out in the spirit and the passion to know his word let's dim down in that age but we see here now Pyrrhus bringing something to to note and this age here see that you love one another with a pure heart seventy verse 23 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible seed in them by the Word of God which liveth and abideth the Lord is blessing the meaning of this word as we want to speak upon the manifestation of the son of man today in his bride a man we come and we variety of sermons I believe 1124 sermons that the Prophet is brought to us in this day and in this age and various books some you know like adoption church ages and the revelation of the same interior now we got into this the the understanding that God has sent a prophet now we know that it fulfills certain scriptural notations in the Bible for example Amos 3 verses 7 insuring the Lord God will do nothing oh right then we find revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God will be completed as is declared on three sevens the purpose here with me man now we are quite content with what we have read what we are seeing and the messages that's coming forth but now we've gone beyond them we've gone beyond the seen that now the manifestation of the Son of Man today is in his bright coming true take you in this day and age we know that it comes with three sons man son of man son of God son of David in between the son of God and Son of David he comes according to his own word look 30 min ago five transformation after coming in a way they don't have a spiritual revelation and understanding that the coming that what was reflection was a spirit and a were coming to quicken the brain that is culture Amen praise the Lord so therefore now we see that in the stage of a perfect man that reality we have faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness religion all these kind of these service manifested in the time now we had poured the first church age and yet the seven churches will have William Branham to the elevation churches and with me are you following me now we came to a point where we had brotherly kindness there are many religious groups that have brotherly kindness many religious groups they have brotherly kindness many Christian groups have brotherly kindness but we're looking at one aspect of the brother that will earmark and grant us higher into the spirit of the holy development the Holy Spirit into a touchstone ministry and the capstone ministry will be divine love and it takes perfect love to go out there can you say amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah now we come to the translation church age and we realize that brother Branham was called in this layered ASEAN church age and being a pro prophet he acted to certain things and when he was seven years old I need a maple tree or what the question don't drink don't smoke I have a work for you to do God has made a way for him that he could breathe is a variety of summer to quicken the driver all right you will be Church a marriage alone now he can't do his commission right in nineteen thirty two year honorable as John the Baptist fall on the first coming of Christ you were four on the second coming a mess Malachi 4 5 and 6 like you with me but now let's go I'll just leave the mysterious card for now and the present bride into ministry and we go further in this million churches I want you to be very very sincere and observe what the Spirit is trying to say to you tonight nothing here we are coming to a conclusion he says as the eternal locust God was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus we are all the fullness of the Godhead body level and that eternal one was the father manifest inflation and thereby gave the title title of service even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn detain the many member body come on our church every man many minutes broken watch see manifest in flesh and those eternal torch now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we absolutely so now we know that we were in his eternal right and we were sealed amen we were sealed so now and as as I say the seals there are many things pertaining to sealed in your motor vehicle you have a seal maybe for the help for the wheel or for the tip for the engine or whatever and if the oil eats you know it's a serious thing you go and repair it and get your carboy then you find also the seal problem was the the Challenger in the United States when they went up and everyone just were blown and they all died yeah why when they investigated over the period of time that there was a seal problem so now as I'm showing you this we were sealed and we were not released the only time that we could spiritually be released and discerning a man the power and Spirit of God the word Amen so when that spirit was released we came out and then the many spoken word seed bodies that are here tonight and in the comforts of the home throughout the world where the bride is big men Christian had a purpose and a hidden mystery that God wanted to make sure that it will come to its full attrition amen praise the Lord now friends we did not become seed by the rebirth amen that's what I'm trying to tell you that we will see and for your sake what for mourning the elect can be reborn because we will see is the reason we could be quickened a member there is a quickening power that is within you that will succumb to the spirit of our mighty God that will come in union under the influence of the Holy Ghost and could bring to pass those things that you needed me know I mean you will work your salvation with fear and trembling this is the hour that we have come can say Amen amen praise the Lord so now in Romans 8 verses 19 for the endless expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God we look in terms of the first church age in messenger oh he was such his name was Saul he was against the Christians right he did everything that he could give me I can suddenly one day as I was walking on the road to Damascus there was a blinding flash blinding light coming down Saul Saul why persecutest down a man who are down I am Jesus so he is conversion and seemingly we thought that this conversion was converting him to move in that realm but there was something there was something that he didn't know but God in His time made it known he was taught by the real the articles of God scriptures he must have thought well you know all these kind of things but then you realize what I am Jesus you realize now he liked to go to the backside of the desert to take his intellectual is about to take his torch out because he knew I matter what started by man amen I never received it know wasn't taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ amen he knew his foundation he knew where he was standing because we had to be a benefice nation amen what he said when he pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb he confirmed that which friends because he knew there was a separating time there was a dividing time then you have to say no it's nama-hatta liveth but Christmas Liberty they saw the ministry the show that very right that he was moving on and they knew that there was amen how do we please hello then my brothers and sisters will find in the revelation of Jesus Christ the church age book chapter 1 now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come to the church and define it we have these experience in the churches we have all these things coming in why because he tries to destroy the super treasure but the super church cannot be destroyed a man let's go further amen right it's a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it look one former and powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word wait down to the time he is cast me into the lake of fire he fights them we don't have to fight the devil because we know where he's going amen we know that we are the blood of Jesus Christ we were we were eternal till it stops amen right and the top is a word that has to be manifested expression so we came into time and time to branch to eternity we like the Jewish quarter okay but now we are moving on it takes God undivided attention to blend with the Holy Ghost sets in our soul amen to work the power of Jesus Christ spiritually in the individual because maybe it's not a combination of people that when you go in the individual walk with God and how you'll be mentioned in the spiritual turn tell mommy tell God how are you sustaining yourself in terms of rectification the message that we need to give God our undivided attention in terms of these things here true that the supernatural could work in the natural the natural could work out the supernatural amen okay he fights them you cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she would be invincible we are we are invincible amen because we are called of God so therefore this true revelation of the true church which we believe that we are in which is a mystical body amen a miserable the mystical body that has been called out individually in spiritual baptism under the influence of the Holy Ghost testifies of the fact that we are in the toilet and first we are in the body we have the word pride which sustained by the heavenlies so that God could come and take her Welli for each one of us to be a son then you say say to get the true revelation of the truth spirits within the framework of the Christian Church now watch Satan spirit at the church how is it greater at the church because some of them when the brand pitch the two kinds of believers in every Church again that returns a believers right some of them they will be just parking in the shade waiting to get some form of critics and then try to form certain thing and then caused a division amongst a church that's his job that is his purpose and that is his job but the true bride the true bride will fight it amen because she has the spirit how does she fight it amen no no my man whatever you want to do you do it I will love you my brother my sister that's it let's continue and do what God has purposed in our lives that we will be able to continue life's a journey for not so long because why we are called to get into the rapture please no no no it says here he will be as definitely tortured today as when Christ which studies every effort to gain power over him in the desert the great amen he says Satan hates revelation but we love it we true revelation in other lights the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we were prevail over a man man so now whenever a Paula step okay now we find that even as the Soul Eater was he already and he was singing and and ran with you to the vision and he went out there and then you know he he cannot be he was very and he seen the people and whatever and but he couldn't see his group and all those kind of things and he was getting very concerned and whatever but he saw Paul's group they you see the first group is they then I preach what Paul preaches and then his group must be there so he saw us us the elected bride to be there amen and then he came to because there's nothing that he has done that he has never told us amen everything manifested itself and then we went through and say amen amen okay now in the Lord went before them by day in a - okay so the actions will be not the profit but the world god amen having no understood this terminology and the expression of terminology now we know will be able to see now there has to be a manifestation shaver Paul has a manifestation William Branham had the manifestation sick was he dead was raised on the fish took the word great strong right be still they meant streudel yes we know day what did he do he never showed something that he didn't want to he tried to express the power of God that have invested in son to be utilized to a people of the world to know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today that was the same teacher friends we need to exercise our god-given responsibility our attitude with regard to the message of the hour that we will succumb to that spirit we have the manifestation of the world so the people could be see Christ amen praise the Lord you are a powerful God amen maybe we never come to the realization but I'm gonna read you something here the Ministry of the Son of Man was the helium of Jesus Christ the word trying to do God a service he sees you but the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ he is come according to the son of man is to reveal himself amongst his people not a man God but he come to behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the father's to the children is our hearts amen it's a question and the heart of the children to the father's has it been done in less the comments might the vicar's can you say amen amen praise Allah so the Ministry of the son of man amen is of vital importance and the essence of spiritual and management to the blood of Jesus Christ because death is what's going to give you the sustainability of ratcheting faith to be understood but the revelation of his word now notice but the opening of the seven seals revelation channel where was it revelation can the full word is to be borne carried into manifestation again and if indicated by the Spirit of God in the food stamp and worse when it was here on earth so if we mentioned that our spiritual barometer or thermo meter or whatever we will see that we are in the same page in the same paragraph of the Prophet so whatever was manifested a has to be manifested in us amen Christ we must the hope of glory we are in types Sunday but Rama period and the many aspects and the fulfillment what is green on as we look at it two parallel the times the signs of the times in which we are living in certain promises of the world we see these things and I'm telling you not only from that time from this time the time shall be no longer let me see Israel we see all these kind of things moving on and coming on right but let's go as it was when it was here on earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that they did when it was here under amen Hebrews 13:8 said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he looks simply in Turkey Jesus said in the last days as it was done in the days of Sodom when the Son of Man will be reveal himself again it would be the same would we look at ourselves and we take inventory and thought of the expression of the word in our lives we will see that we are not not weighed in the balance and found wanting because there are certain diversity of things that comes into us like that take us away from the reality of what God is now for the super church to act the way that God wanted to act and make mark 16 in action there are certain categories that we need to further its listing there are things that we need to do in there are things that we need to put in place praise God hallelujah brother Joshua was ministering is missing and bringing up certain things of the Word of God it's for what to create an appetite that you will be able through that appetite we sustain and to see and look ahead and just be home and just to make sure that things are available where there are a maybe so dear friends never give up proving his worth do you believe we are living in the last days when the Son of Man was to be manifested question that would be all the word that's dead after Luther I was a Baptist and all that every Pentecostal all that after the revelation of what is on be the seventh angel was to open the sixth seal mystery it's hard to be dead enough in the son of man these fullness of time has come to the fullness of his word to manifest the fullness of his body amen amen we are you know no shortcuts didn't we are the many remembered spoke a seed word a manner like we are the seed and what did that take it your trick if you take the quickening spurt mm-hmm you come right into yourself you can bypass the dot but you have faith what is faith is that revelation revelation of what of understanding in Christ Jesus they want you out that that the outside the spirit level of imagination reasoning affection and all that when we went away then he come to the body senses all that would be what went away why God is working in the inside to show for the outside that the outside could work in the instance a man freeze beauty girlfriend Ellen me the Word made flesh hallelujah the word operating in human flesh in the world operating in human flesh you and me come on now amen but physical science but material science the scriptures perfectly to bring to you a perfect faith for a plethora literature amen the 700 time your posture pray how many time you pray how many time you prayed in your home wherever you are and you saw the magnificent way in which God has purposed and brought those requests to pass amen come on up hallelujah you're speaking you pray I know if her brother the kid from Zimbabwe that came to our church me it's a young man and he's getting on and crying and he was yeah cancer skin cancer do you know what to do he came to my son his father did some operation when the King Edward and whatever it is spoke to me that he's from Zimbabwe and he's living in Stanga one telephone call made a big difference the body goes through the telephone call from that time he was progressing getting here and now if our God can do that how much oh my god could heal our dear brothers that's in hospital that she said that's in hospital and all those that are in various homes or whatever see first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you amen amen now it's a son of man Christ that was Christ in the city of Christ in Moses Christ in David it was Jesus the same yesterday today and forever you see the Prophet in China he didn't say Christ in William Brennan you wanted you to get the revelation to know it was close to him then he goes on to say the word be made manifest by these prophets you didn't put him we need to catch that right so it was manifested a don't you think it will manifest in us amen why do you think you're coming here for not to come and sit and make the chair hot or whatever it is in this winter it is cold winter day no there is a purpose and a hidden treasure that is what I'm going to speak this morning he says in Christ the mystery of God revealed the hidden mystery of God how it has been manifested now we are speaking about the seals in 1963 right there's a carpet you palenik God was up there we know that that was Christ we know that that was the seven angels come on amen where we were we were there some of us were born right we were in this body called titan' fresh we never realized anything I'm a Christian now I don't do all those kind of things something happened but the release of the seal was to sin and electrification of his spirit in your soul to quicken and to let you know that that seat has to grow they did season in each time after the opening of the word of your Amen hallelujah so you I hear your quicken you say thank you hood I am the Jesus seed of God oh I've come from eternity I'm an earth and now I want to go back into eternity I have to do certain things and let me move so we find in the right there's a pillar of fire above brother branham's head the same pillar of fire was exercised by Moses the same pillar of fire was exercised by Paul is the same pillar of fire that has come down in our day and you never age can you say amen amen we go into the Old Testament and we look at certain things 280 10 and he largely took his mental and wrapped it together did you say a man and he smoked the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry God and he came to pass when they were brought over the hill I just said unto Elijah that's what I shall do for thee before I'd be taken away from me and in that Shakespeare I pray thee let a double portion of that spirit and he said I was asked nevertheless it does seem when I'm taken from thee it shall be so and too deep but if not it shall not be so he was honest and it came to pass as ages as they still went on and talked that behold it appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder right and Elijah went up I will be a man of God went by a well with Enoch was translated why here are the testimony what was the testimony please God what is our testimony brights testimony we need to please don't burn all the prophets told us what to do we need to do so what were in those thunders no one knows really connote me I'll be reading I will find it out and Elijah saw in any claim my father my father the chariot of Israel and the horsemen devil and his Swain Noble and he took hold of his own clothes and rim them in two pieces he took up also the metal that front from him and ran back and stood by the Bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah the flood from him and smote the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he had when he also had the waters they parted hitter and today and Elijah window appearances Elijah is typing the church you can see the cherry you can see the fire you can see it I said the full mental past a double portion comes up day to waste a double portion now make the valley full of ditches but if I said that poured water for Elijah's hands what a marvelous prophet he had a double portion I like them Elijah and Elijah in tight let's type it a minute look the invited the whole prophet we presented Christ Elisha the church we present the church so there is a church we did a church there's a brother within the private parties run is not Israel our pride is not bright any danger to the will of God and the will of God is the word of God and the Word of God amen this the power in the revelation that has to be instill in the hearts of the believers can you say amen amen Elijah and Elijah hello watching him say then 1 then 1 the first thing you know down from heaven came a chariot horses of fire and big night [Music] we talking about manifestations of the Son of man ministry but there has to be a type and there's to be something let's look Amen at the time okay hot see at the Syrian army he was out there the Syrian army was oh he didn't know what to do but he knew the God that he was serving when he looked up his natural anti way the spiritual eyes came in and you saw the chariots and all those things that were there and you have their victory come on crazy just like hearing me when we look at our situations we look at our problems I want to tell you something the squeeze is on disco but nineteen thing it's going all over this show we got the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the indwelling presence of Christ power so if you got it covered 19 cool older thank you for this course with the Son of God made manifest to destroy them they've got be for us who can be against us come on don't touch the fear and sit in this fear in that in the household in the countries and nationally one to show how great he is but he doesn't know that yet Calvary Jesus Christ was crucified why to take the rain said of the world and by stripes we are healed if that was a if that was the catalyst then that it we say that we are making many members body of Christ then we will have the same properties Christ and can you say amen amen praise the Lord [Music] are you happy amen so you have to have it when God is silent we better be slender can you say amen amen goddess Aden you better decide but wait he has spoken we had better speed but where he has spoken we better speak to me he's given you the power and authority of mark 16 you are invincible army amen you are the true Church of the Living God if God is solid we better be gonna psyche he says but where he has spoken we had better speak to and say what he has already said he told us the evidence of what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost was that we would have the teacher come and teach all truth but the teacher was an inside teacher not an option if the spread wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth mm-hm you have to spiritually come on no church right so he said you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by revelation if you heard it every moment of the day that was a sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of Paul those were full of the Holy Ghost had the word received it and amen we heard the word but the prophet of Malachi 4 amen the brother was singing but the Holy Ghost amen and we take common cognizance of the very fact those words really meant for us praise the Lord Mike it was spirit let word fit so many the coming he didn't know anything but he was ministering the Word of the Lord Jesus Son of Man Elijah William Brennan son of man is a man Elijah they give Church with the double [Music] which is right before many peoples and nations he finds now this book brother bland prepared and spoke and you read the book of Lakhan and many other people and he taught this is what the seals was he can you say but never day there had to be a change in dispensation there had to be [Music] today [Music] you have the how many time did you get into desperation come on we supposed to be candidates for the Dutch I'm speaking to everybody I'm speaking in myself okay every time the Prophet went up in the woods he prayed and God gave him a sermon he came and he preached it for a people throughout the world and we need to pray and ask God dear Heavenly Father will you come and invade yourself Emma's father as you did seem to the to brother to brother branham as you unveiled to him Lord be the same inspiration the validity of his spirit the spirit come and quicken and wickedness that be maybe we will do the very same party Israel help us slow sometimes we are finished but we are asking you for divine grace we are asking you for Greece the chakras will come and take control that you may come Lord Amen God knows our weaknesses God knows everything about us it stays in Tipton waist at 33 I'm 33 and 34 of the church age book in 1st Corinthians 2:15 the true revelation is God interpreting his own worried by vindicating what is promised ever now don't let anyone be misled on what I have said and think that I do not believe in the accuracy of the world as we now have it I believe this Bible is accurate amen I believe this Bible is accurate either Jesus completely arty authenticated the Old Testament reign here on earth and it was compiled exactly as was our New Testament make no mistake about it we have the infallible Word of God today and no man days take from it or add to it because many people they suppose that this is what it is like you were Frank and injections and and what sure it will because Jackson was they and when he was climbing up and and he saw them in the corner of his eye so genius Jackson there the path trying to do something in whatsoever that's all it's not that a true revelation but the true spirit well know who she is and which them the Antichrist spirit you will know that the Holy Ghost is the interpreter of the Divine
