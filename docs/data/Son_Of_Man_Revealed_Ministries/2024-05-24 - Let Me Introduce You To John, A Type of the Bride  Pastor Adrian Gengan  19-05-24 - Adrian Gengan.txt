brother visited us your church amen amen hallelujah he was really uh interested I think he came twice already but we know the Lord lay seeds in people and at the appointed time amen we don't know when these things will happen but good to see you all again amen you're looking well look like you 11 aged people don't age in Cape Town amen praise the Lord greet everybody else in the name of our Lord

Amen brother the the family not sure Amen brother Caleb's working amen hallelujah and sister Maggie her mom's not sure amen this morning but amen we are here to Worship the Lord and give him praise amen let's turn to our Bibles amen let's turn to John 1:35 amen we're going to be looking at John who the type of the Bride hallelujah amen you know brother Bram tells us that John is the type of the bride and he represents everything that the bride goes through therefore nothing is wit from the bride at this time because only John is given the Book of Revelation amen so it takes a prophet to reveal the book to us hallelujah so for title I'd say let me introduce you to John a type of the Bride so John 1:35 says again the next day after John stood this is John the Baptist now and two of his disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he said Behold the Lamb of God and the two disciples heard him speak and they follow Jesus then Jesus turned and saw them following and said unto them what seek ye they said unto him Rabbi which is which is to say being interpreted Master where dwellest thou and he said unto them come and see now notice one of those disciples is John and when those four beasts are calling him he's told again come and see Hallelujah so the first time John has come and sees on the earth he said unto him come and see they came and saw where he dwelleth and with him that day for it was about the 10th hour amen hallelujah 10 is a very important number to John one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother he first finded his own brother Simon and said unto him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ and he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art Simon the son of Jonah and thou shalt be called sephus which is by interpretation a stone amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so we are given our first look at the Apostle John here in this chapter and we see that John is a follower of John the Baptist amen he's the disciple of the first Forerunner Hallelujah but we see John is equipped with special Revelation because he is equipped to follow the Living Word manifested the word was manifested in John the Baptist he's able to connect with that Ministry because John the Baptist is a Living manifested Word but when there's a progression of the word he's able to follow the progression of the word amen amen so John means god is gracious amen amen God is gracious and if there's any people that have received Grace in this hour it's the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen in fact we've received a double portion Grace in this hour because the headstone is coming with crys of Grace Grace amen amen so we see that John as we said is a type of the church and a type of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so here he is a a disciple of the first four runner and how how beautifully is it type now that we were Disciples of William Bram the second Forerunner amen but when 63 cames amen the head now appears amen hallelujah and he's introducing Rebecca to Isaac amen must leave just the church age messenger and follow the real messenger for the age amen which is the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah amen hallelujah didn't the prophet always say I must decrease and he must increase amen too many people got married to the Forerunner but John won't get married to the Forerunner John will follow the word amen amen so we find here that when he's there at the baptis he's there at the river when John declares Behold the Lamb of God God now John hears this John the Apostle hears this and he's able to identify truth and he leaves John the Baptist to follow Jesus he doesn't denominate around John's message amen amen he doesn't denominate around John's Doctrine amen he doesn't denominate around John's baptism amen but he follows the manifested Living Word now this disciple John is called he refers to himself the disciple whom Jesus loved isn't that a beautiful thing amen he's a type of the Bride but he's the disciple whom Jesus loved and if there's ever a woman that Jesus loves in this hour it's the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we find here amen that John we know he lived to be 70 years 90 years old amen and his writing is not like any other writer there's four gospels in the Bible but he writes differently to the other writers if you follow John's writing this man is a highly revelated man his Revelation surpasses Matthew Mark Luke amen hallelujah like he has Revelation like no other Matthew Mark Luke amen takes Jesus life from his birth amen but John is a man of Revelation amen he is given a special Grace and a favor amen he records jesus' birth before he came into flesh he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was God the word was with God then he goes down to say the word became flesh and dwelt amongst us amen he's able to identify Jesus amen hallelujah as the logos the was the one that came out of the spirit God amen amen which is called the Son of God so this is now MDC he's able to identify him as the word yes yes hallelujah amen and we know when we typing these things we can see our Revelation now it fits perfectly amen that's why brother Bram is preaching who is this MDC amen he's preaching Mighty God unveil he's showing us the mystery of God he's showing us how God condescended from Spirit to word to flesh yes amen amen hallelujah so John says the the word became flesh and dwelt amongst us what is he saying the logos the logos became flesh Hallelujah am amen if you only know what the logos meant amen hallelujah in the beginning amen it was Elohim the self-existent one amen hallelujah but out of him came the logos out of him in the logos was locked up all the names that was written in the book amen hallelujah so when the logos becomes flesh John is right next to Jesus who locked up in Jesus is all the names that are written in the book yes Hallelujah and he says all that the father has given me will come to me and not one of them is lost yes amen thank you Lord Jesus came to save and seek and save those that the names that were there in the Lamb's Book of Life amen hallelujah he didn't come amen for just anybody amen amen hallelujah amen whosoever believeth on him can get General salvation but the ones whose names are in the book have special privileges amen has a special access to the heart of God has a special access to the revelations of this hour Lord thank you amen the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen has special privileges amen so we find here that when one thing that stands out about John's introduction when he's writing amen John claims that Jesus is God yes if you read John chapter 1 he claims that Jesus is God Amen Hallelujah no other book details that like John does it amen so John here is revealing amen so many different things amen now just want to get to some quotes here very quickly some short quotes and we'll show you how that the four gospels of brother Bram says God's the book of Acts and Matthew is the lion amen hallelujah Mark is the ox Luke is the man but John is the eagle amen and he says in the first quote in Revelation chapter 4 he says boy the South Gates guarded by the ox and he says the East Gate is guarded by the lion so he makes a mistake and he corrects himself so I'm not reading that he says the East Gate is God by The Lion and the north gate is guarded by the Flying Eagle amen and he says John the Evangelist yes amen hallelujah amen now notice something there don't miss it who's at the North Gate come on now you reading it who is at the North Gate John is at the North Gate amen and who's trying to make a move on the sides of the north amen so whose Revelation is he coming after I'm talking about Lucifer now he said I will Ascend I will sit upon the sides of the north the size of the north is Mount Zion the type of the Bride amen he's not going to the south gate he's not going to the East Gate he's not going to the west gate but he's making a move on this end time prde he's trying to descend on the sides of the north amen but there's an anointing of a flying eagle at the northern gate amen that will counter every one of his attacks amen they will not allow allow Lucifer to sit that word sit if you go and look at it it means to be married he's trying to marry this end time bride he's trying to put his seed in her seeds of discrepancy amen but this bride is already pregnated with the word amen she'll take no manmade seed amen she won't fall for the lies of Satan amen she won't fall for the lies of Lucifer amen this one is born of his bone this one is flesh of his flesh oh somebody ought to praise God Amen hallelujah amen so we see John is a type of the eagle a flying eagle amen he's in action ready for service amen he's not a Sitting Duck he's a flying eagle amen he's not in a chicken yard clacking there amen he's not stretching in the chicken yard Hallelujah he's a flying eagle typing the fourth living creature and the spirit of a flying eagle amen what are they doing Eagle to Eagle Revelation under the fourth seal hope you got that what's the fourth c will say the fourth B said come and see who's the fourth Beast what symbol is he eagle and who's John so under the fourth seal it's Eagle to Eagle Revelation amen under the fourth seal all L is Unleashed upon the Earth yes the rider on the horse is called Death and All Hell follows him but the Beast who is the type of the eagle is connecting with John the eagle the bride and saying come and see because if all hell is Unleashed upon the Earth then all Heaven Must Be Unleashed upon the Earth as well that's what Revelation 10 is all about the mighty Angel descending and he not descending alone the host of Heaven is following him am hallelujah amen Revelation 10 is a time of War amen it's a time of judgment you'll see his feet as brass amen pillars of fire amen it's a time of investigating judgment it's a time of warfare amen where 200 million demons are on the Earth but Angelic forces are here amen the angel of the Lord is here amen with Supernatural assistance for the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ he won't leave his Eve trapped in Eden without Supernatural assistance amen open the boy's eyes is my prayer this morning open the church this morning to connect with the supernatural realm am amen hallelujah amen amen how many if you ready for Warfare this morning amen I'm coming to you from the dimension amen of heavenly places this morning and I pray that you can extend to that realm this morning Amen to be seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen hallelujah amen you're in the Sixth Seal and when you open the fourth seal we just just detail this Eagle to Eagle Revelation when he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast saying come now when the lamb opened the fourth seal let's stop here the fourth seal who opened it the lamb was anybody else worthy no one else could do it no the lamb opened the fourth seal the fourth Beast the living creature Like an Eagle said to John the eagle come and see what the fourth mystery of the Plan of Redemption has been hid in this book cuz the lamb was opening it in other words that's what he was saying there's a fork mystery here I've showed you in symbol now John I don't know whether you understood it or not but he wrote it down what he saw but it was a mystery and he wrote what he saw I want you to know the prophet is saying I don't know if John really understood what he wrote but even if that John didn't understood what he wrote this John this bride amen has been revealed the Revelation has been given to her what has been written because the writer scheme has been exposed we know that righty is we know that Antichrist system amen we know that amen he's fixing Satan is fixing to become incarnate in that beast that's right amen that's right so my point there was to show you Eagle to Eagle Revelation amen hallelujah the prophet in the 16 he says it's the eagle age that gets the word and the Revelation amen hallelujah the bride under messenger becomes the final voice to the final age Hallelujah that's a quote the bride under a messenger becomes the final voice to the final age so you and I have a work to do amen we must prophesy we must speak amen we cannot stay silent amen yes Lord hallelujah amen hallelujah Eagle to Eagle Revelation what we have is Eagle food in this hour amen the prophet of God says in who is this mesic after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food Hallelujah this message of the hour is Eagle food you can't give it to chickens amen they can't stomach it amen you remember that man the B Paul shares the stest tomor gave him a book and and the boss came back very angry the next day and he said this man in this book he calls me a chicken yes and this guy told the boss well this man in this book calls me an eagle amen hallelujah people reading the message of the hour some get offended amen hallelujah but we are reading it and we see how ourselves in the book we see ourselves in the mystery amen after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing yes amen amen you left the other thing brother jaff brother Joshua brother Leslie Amen brother rames you left the other thing Hallelujah yes you left religions amen you left denominations you have been then formed into the living image of the Living God amen amen I want you to know if you have been formed into the living image of the Living God then I say unto you you are little Messiahs you can't be in the image of the Living God and have less power than him he says all authority I've given unto you amen praise the Lord the problem is people don't recognize their identity the people don't realize the power they possess in the power of their word amen always speaking negativity always speaking doubt always speaking fear amen yes sir and there's a lot of people who just wait to Amen to hear those things amen they thrive on those things to hear your doubt your negativity your reasoning amen but the bride of Christ is positive the bride of Christ speaks positive amen the bride of Christ is NE never negative no matter what the situation is she speaks positive amen even if it's just one word the bride of Christ holds on to that one word even sometimes she may not understand a whole lot of things but she's holding on to that one word thank you praise the Lord thank you Lord amen what he says you've been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany no other group of people can tell you that they heard from their theophany in fact no other group of people actually know that there is a theop body waiting there Hallelujah we were given a sneak preview by the prophet of the age amen when he went beyond the curtain of time and he saw those theophonic bodies Amen in the Brilliance of the youth amen eyes sparkling amen eyes glistening amen like stars on a darken night amen woman amen so beautifully dressed Amen in the Brilliance of the youth man in the Brilliance of the Young Manhood coming forth and grabbing him and screaming our precious brother amen amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord now he says notice you heard from your theophany right so this message comes to connect you with your theophany amen hallelujah every time you hear a message amen and it's speaking to you calling your name you're connecting with your theophany amen you're connecting back with your theophany and one of these days there'll be a final connection Amen Hallelujah Lord he says notice here in the message the Easter seal recognize the call of God's word which is a part of and it's an eagle to an eagle but it was the scream of an eagle there was something inside that little fellow that know he was an eagle and the same thing is with every True Believer when the preaching of God's word comes forth and is Vindicated and proved that it's God's word for this hour then there's something within the believer oh can you feel the pull this morning I don't care how loyal his father was to the church how his mother was or his grandparents and if that church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the Holy Ghost message there's something in him that screams out he leave that b he's got to do it the chicken may have been all right one day but this is Eagle hour aren't you glad for Eagle hour with eagle hour comes Eagle power amen amen now the holy spirit is here on Earth looking out those individuals that God has ordained to life in this age the Holy Ghost is going brooding across the Earth like great Jehovah Eagle calling out your name amen that's why the message of the hour must be preached in its fullness amen we can't preach a partial gospel and a partial salvation message we've got to preach complete re Redemption plan when we are witnessing amen amen because we are not calling names of those outside the city neither are we calling those amen for General salvation our call is for the names in the book amen amen right thank you Lord amen praise the Lord amen you see what a sacred trust has been given the church amen to prophesy again he says the holy spirit is here on Earth looking out those individuals that God has ordained to life in this age and as soon as it finds it it comes down and takes its place of aboard into the human heart life amen brought the quicking power oh this morning if you haven't got it say Lord come down Holy Spirit come and take your place in my life bring the quickening power so does the holy spirit that come upon us in this day it will manifest the promise of this hour yes you see why John at John the Apostle had to follow the word the Holy Ghost was leading him it's this it's the Holy Spirit coming down to Quicken make alive those people that's for ordained of God to be in the Rapture so this message has for a call to the Rapture that's what the shout is a call to the Rapture to gather the living Saints amen if you responded to the call you can't stop halfway you need to make preparation for the Rapture because the message is a call for the Rapture amen yes amen that is if he's a true Eagle he will understand the message amen of the hour if is a true Eagle yes amen praise the Lord amen now yeah in the Book of John 1:8 very very interesting here he says no man had seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he had declared him amen now in biblical times you know that when they would often recline upon the bosom of their loved ones during Feast the bosom is also near the heart amen Hallelujah so you you know that they share a special bond I'm bringing this to show you the bridegroom now amen that he lay in the bosom of the father special affection special attention but there's another one who lays on the bosom of Jesus in John 13 verse 23 amen yes there's a connection there in the 23rd verse amen amen St John 23 now there was leaning on jesus' bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus loved John a type of the Bride laying on the bosom of Jesus Amen only the bride can lay in the bosom of Jesus Amen like Jesus laying in the bosom of the Father the bride is laying in the bosom of Jesus because why is that amen there's a close relationship with the Lord amen this is typing the close intimate relationship with Jesus Christ Our bridegroom hey amen amen amen you know this John here this John the Apostle they took him and and they they were so frustrated with this man and he was so full of the Holy Ghost they put him on a h of pmas Amen but before they you know I want to read it from the prophet so you get what I'm saying here amen an exposition of the church ages the P Vision he says you will notice that John has addressed himself to the Christians as a brother in Tribulation when arrested they tried in vain to kill him by boiling him in oil for 24 hours boil me with oil in this 24th age amen of 2000 boil me with the Holy Ghost let they come a double portion oil is the type of the Holy Ghost I'm jumping ahead of myself but they tried to boil John in a cauldron of oil amen for 24 hours they tried to boil him the enraged and Powerless officials then sentenced him to Patmos as a witch he wouldn't die they couldn't boil the holy ghost out of him this man was so full of the power of God that the oil and the fire couldn't touch him amen hallelujah praise the Lord they put him on athmos as a witch but God was with him and he was spared to leave the island and returned to Ephesus where he again continued as Pastor until the time of his death am so he's boiling oil oil is the type of the Holy Ghost amen and here was the Man full of the Holy Ghost amen the prophet says here in the Masterpiece they couldn't boil the holy ghost out of him with oil so he come forth his work wasn't finished he died a natural death and if your work is not finished no amount of Satan's schemes or his Devils or his IMS can take your life prematurely amen if God is not finished with you if you have not served his purpose complet completely on the earth nobody or nothing can touch your life no sickness no disease amen no accident nothing can touch your life amen because you have a purpose of God to fulfill on the earth so don't walk in fear in this latest and age amen you are not walking in darkness but a great light has come upon the bride amen arise and shine for thy light has come amen and the glory of the Lord is risen upon you church amen the glory of the Lord is risen upon on you in this hour there's no need to fear amen they can't touch your life amen hallelujah that ought to give us an assurance amen hallelujah that ought to give us amen amen a Vigor to live we find here on the AL of pmos is where John gets his Revelation and he shown things that are to be amen he shown the Heavenly Realms he sees Jesus in the midst of seven golden candlesticks the disciple beloved John amen Who Loved Jesus so much here on the earth that he would rest on his bosom at supper time he gets to see Jesus amen and Jesus says I am the Alpha and Omega I am the first and the last amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen he gets to see him in the midst of seven golden candlesticks he gets to see the throne room of God Amen he gets to see the lamb taking the book he gets to see the seals he gets to see the Thunders he gets to see the trumpets he gets to see the vials he gets to see the Beast of Revelation he gets to see the the hot amen he gets to see Armageddon he gets to see the Lamb's wife amen Johnny showed the complete plan of God because the bride has the mind of Christ amen and he knows what she knows what he wants done with the Worden people get bored with the revelations of the hour amen but the word of God has come to put the mind of Christ in the bride amen this ought to be Eagle food for us John amen you know brother Bram says I am identified with America and all of its Glory I'm identified with America and all of its shame he says I was there at P Rock I was there amen with George Washington how many of you read that amen he's identified with them through representation I'm bringing that for a point amen hallelujah because when he walked Calvary Road amen when he walked up goat's he ours there amen when they slapped him on Pilot's all I was there amen when they whipped him I was there thank you Lord amen now physically physically now John the type of the Bride that is just a quote the brother brother gram says right but I want to show you John is the type of the bride was physically there John was there at Mount Transfiguration in fact John was one part of the elite group there was three of them Peter J jam and John you know these three brothers have were tight amen when they went to J's house they kicked everyone out but these three were alloud in the house these were men of Faith amen become part of the elite group don't be lacking in faith amen we'll keep you out the house amen you'll still be a disciple but you won't be allowed in the house what we need is men of Faith what we need is woman of Faith amen when the need arises we can call on you amen amen hallelujah John was there on my Transfiguration amen The Book of Luke actually records that they were caught up together in the cloud John was caught up John saw Moses and Elijah amen John is caught up there to see Jesus glorified he's given special privileges the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen John is there in the garden when Jesus prays amen John is there when Jesus is arrested John is there at the Judgment all John is there at the crucifixion yes amen you know at the crucifixion Jesus hanging on the cross he looks to the Bible says he looks to Mary you can probably pick it in John 19 there he looks to Mary and he says Mary behold your son pointing to John and he says John behold your mother being the eldest in the home I'm talking about natural things now amen it was his duty to make sure his mother was taken care of and who better than to entrust his mother to ugly mother than to John the one close to his heart the one amen who's a part of him oh hallelujah amen God won't UST amen important things to just anybody he's entrusting it to John amen if you didn't read it amen hallelujah it says here amen Jesus speaks to Mary and John at the cross he says woman behold your son and John behold your mother and the Bible says now and from that time that disciple took her unto his own home John took Mary and he took care of her as his mother hallelujah amen amen amen hallelujah amen what was Mary typing the birth place of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah the home womb amen that Jesus came into the world Amen the birthing place thank you Lord praise the Lord take her and keep her but don't just keep her in your home John make sure she's there at Pentecost make sure she's there in the upper room John the only way I can make way from my mom amen H ugly mother is for her to be in the upper room so she was part of the 120 amen who received the baptism of the Holy Ghost Mary was one of them amen hallelujah that was staggering out of their drunk yes hallelujah hallelujah some of you need to read your Bible amen amen amen praise the Lord Jesus leaving Mary to the care of John John was the first one to reach the tomb yes when the the woman came to tell the disciples Peter and John started to run but John outran Peter and he came into the tomb and he saw the napkin laying there but he never entered the tomb he allowed Peter to go in first amen then afterwards he record then he went into the tomb and he saw the napkin laying there what am i showing you I was there with him I'm trying to prove brother bram's point I was there with him I was there at his crucifixion I watched him die I watched him take a Roman Spear and Pierce his side amen and water and blood came out of his side the birthing place of the Church of Jesus Christ amen the birthing place of the bride of Christ amen she came forth from his very own side amen oh some of you are to rejoice in that because that is when the church was birth at the cross amen amen yes thank you Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord you see we have history with Jesus amen we wasn't just born now in the 20th century amen you wasn't just born in the 21st century amen your history goes all the way back amen I was there with him amen even the Book of Job records where were you Hallelujah I was there amen glory be to his name praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen John was the first one to reach the tomb John was there Amen to see witness the resurrection John was there to see the garments laying John was there amen when Jesus first appeared to them in fact it was John when when they were fishing and the disciples are now fishing and Jesus appears to them on the sea it is join that is able to identify the glorified Lord Jesus and he tells Peter that's the master John given special privileges amen special Revelation to recognize the master thank you Lord amen praise the Lord amen we find John at the Ascension John watches amen a cloud come down and Jesus go up in a cloud we know that was no ordinary Cloud we know that was not a rain cloud we know that was a cloud of angels amen that came to receive the Lord Jesus Christ and he says the same way that you see him go is the same way you'll see him come amen yes Lord so is it any wonder that when he descends with a shout he's clothed with seven angels amen amen is it any wonder that he's clothed with a cloud in Revelation 10 he clothed with a cloud the angel himself was his wig and brother brand will say that's our Lord up there is it any Wonder amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen hallelujah praise the lord we see a John caught up amen and he sees the seven Church ages how the Antichrist Spirit worked and he watched John watched there and he's read you'll read there when he's speaking in Revelation chap 2 and then three he's seeing the deception of the church how the bark was taken away how the leaves was taken away how the life was taken away from the church and he's watching amen the Antichrist Spirit ride amen hallelujah he's watched and he sees all the way to the seven Church age and he sees Jesus standing on the outside of his very own church John is seeing this the bride is seeing this you are seeing this amen watching Jesus being kicked outside the Church you say how are they kicking in they kick the word out when they rejected the prophet's message they kicked the word out Hallelujah and Jesus is the word when they kick the prophet's message out they kick the word out and he's left outside knocking trying to gain entrance into that church amen and John is a witness to all of this amen the Bride is a witness to all of this how they kicked him out the church but she doesn't leave him outside the church the bride opens up the door amen and says come away my beloved come my beloved she gives him an Avenue to walk through even though they kicked him out of that seven Church age oh come on Church give God an Avenue to walk through don't kick him out of your life amen give God an Avenue to walk through your life be like another Mary and say be it unto me according to Thy word amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so we see here he sees the buck the leaves amen the life being taken out of the church and he sees amen Jesus left on the outside knocking and then we find amen there's a mystery there now then brother Bram says that John is representing the church because in the Revelation chapter 4 he is caught up and brother brandham types that with a Rapture and he says come up higher and when he comes up higher what happens the mystery of God is revealed amen he goes into the Throne Room in Revelation 4 and he sees one sitting on the throne amen amen the the the denominational world says there's three they are co-equal amen but when John gets to Heaven he sees one sitting on the throne so the mystery of God is revealed amen and they worship him as Creator you'll see the elders the 24 Elders bowing down and saying for thou H has created all things so the Worship in Revelation 4 they are worshiping him as Creator but the worship scene changes in Revelation 5 amen amen in Revelation 5 they no longer worship him as Creator they now worship him as Redeemer when he takes the book for thou was slain thou was worthy to take the book Hallelujah he hey hey amen hallelujah I pray you following me this morning amen we are firing like a machine gun this morning for reason amen we are not giving devil a chance to move this morning amen you better stay focused amen you better stay in range you better stay in the stay in the range of the fighting parameter amen if you step outside the bounds of this maybe you're letting your mind wand amen Satan is going to attack you right now amen because we wrestle not against flesh and blood we wrestle against principalities and Powers rulers of Darkness spiritual wickedness in high places amen I know what I'm doing this morning amen I'm here to defeat the enemy your life amen I'm here to bring Deliverance amen you say what are you doing I am prophesying again if you don't understand what I'm doing I am prophesying again calling your name in the book you say you're not calling I'm calling mystery after mystery type after type Shadow after Shadow to see your name in the book If you can't see it then you may be blind this morning but I pray God takes the scales of of your eyes this morning and you see your name in the book amen somebody give God praise somebody give him a Shabbat this morning [Applause] amen John is there to see amen hallelujah the seven golden candlesticks he's there to see the Seven Stars in in the hand of the one in the midst of the golden candlesticks hallelujah amen now what book is that found in Revelation 5 when he's there now in the throne room he's there and the Bible says and a strong Angel if you go type the that going it's a mighty Angel cries out who is worthy to take the book amen Revelation five why five Grace not just any Grace now he's receiving a double Grace in this amen Revelation 5 strategically two places now that's important to the bride is revelation 5 and Revelation 10 yeah amen Revelation 5 is single Grace oh yes Revelation 10 is double Grace amen hallelujah yes amen so in Revelation 5 John is present when a call is made looking for a man yes who is worthy to take the book and break the seals of the book yes why is this book important it's the title deed to man's inheritance yes amen you are created to be a God on on the Earth but through the fall you lost your godship you lost your authority to speak amen but the message of the hour has come to bring the book back to us to put Sons back in their position so that you can possess the power of the spoken word thank you I need you to come up to a to your level now amen I need you to come up to your god-given potential amen hallelujah praise the Lord he's calling for somebody to break the seals because the book is a titled deed to man's inheritance and in that book has names am that is the Lamb section of the book of life and he is calling for somebody to open the book so he can see his name in the book amen hallelujah how many if you ready for some Revelation amen how many if you ready to step it up a bit now amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen they called amen for a man to come who is worthy to take the book and it must be a man of the earth therefore God couldn't come illegally into the human race he had to get a woman who would amen agree to his plan agree to lend the body so that he could come through the woman the seed of the woman amen so he came legally into the human race to pay the price for Redemption am amen and they're calling for they're calling for him is there one worthy and they say they searched the heaven they they search the Earth yes they search beneath the Earth and they said no one is worthy oh what a sin what a time no one is worthy to take back man's inheritance now remember John don't belong in heaven John was created to be a God on the earth amen amen just like us our Eternal home is not heaven people want to die and get to heaven amen Heaven is a short space of time we shall come back to the Earth we shall come back to rule and Reign on the earth Man was created for the Earth yes now John being a type of the Bride him being a man he's also not worthy to take the book hallelujah amen he's not even worthy to look there on hallelujah amen now remember in that book is the names that were written from before the foundation of the world so that book is typing the mind of Christ praise the Lord amen amen so John is crying because he wants to identify the ones whose names are written in the book before the foundation of the world but no one is found worthy now where was Jesus why couldn't they find Jesus they searched Heaven they searched the Earth they even searched beneath the Earth why couldn't they find Jesus the Bible says when he ascended he became the high priest to make intercession on our behalf so he in the holiest of holies he in the holiest of holies making intercession for seven Church ages brother Brandon will tell us and it's in the Bible that nobody could go into the holiest of holies they had to wait for the priest to come back out amen after he had P made the intercession after he had sprinkled the seven drops of blood upon the altar so they had to wait for the time of intercession to be over and but in the meantime John is crying John is weeping yes may I suggest to you that it's the Cry of John a type of the Bride his queen that brings him out of the sanctuary amen there's a grown there are people crying out for Redemption there the people on the Earth crying out now and the Heart of the Lord Jesus Christ can't bear to see his Queen crying so he comes back out again somebody give God praise amen hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah God don't like a dead church amen God likes a lively church amen hallelujah you say what are you talking about Jesus goes there Amen in John 11 he goes to the grave of Lazarus and he sees Lazarus a dead church he even makees makes Jesus cry even Jesus Christ seeing lazarus's dead Church don't make Jesus cry be a lively Church be a church full of amens Amen be a church who connects with the spirit of God Jesus won't leave you in your dead condition he called Lazarus that day but I'm calling your name today if you're in a dead condition if you're in a lukewarm condition I'm calling you name to come back to life am yes Lord thank you Lord amen amen amen praise the Lord amen it's the Cry of the Bride that brings him out of the sanctuary didn't he say I'll wipe away all tears from your eyes and he knows exactly what to do to stop John's tears amen child your cries have awoken the master amen they were crying out on the boat that day and they called out to Jesus amen praise the Lord amen he will withow nothing from for his Queen Ty up there looking for his Queen amen hallelujah this is in the breach message now hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen he will withw nothing from his Queen the bride was reduced to Tears in Heaven because no one was found worthy to put her back in her or to be conditioned yes no one was worthy to restore back to a full Glory so she cries out amen praise the Lord your cry touches his heart look here go up one context yeah let's just see it so they know in the same chapter Revelation 5 the lamb only mediator he was the one that came forth what did he do now he's back the interceding until his blood is atoned for every person and the lamb knows what's written in the book so if we want to know what's written in the book we need the mind of Christ so he know from the foundation of the world the names were in there I was just preaching all of these things I'm just showing you the quote now stood back there done the mediator work till everyone that's been put in the book has been redeemed now he walks out he's done his Kinsman work amen right let's go to this verse now now he comes to take his bride he's coming out of the sanctuary hearing his bride cry he comes to take his bride amen he comes now as king he is looking for his Queen Amen in this book is the whole secret of it wrapped up around it Seven Seals All brother Seven Seals waiting for him to come amen amen yes so I'm saying it again The Cry of the Bride brought him back amen amen it was also time and season for him to come back out hallelujah praise the Lord now you must also make John worthy in heaven he's not worthy Revelation 10 he suddenly asked to take the book so he must make the bride worthy and the only way he can make the bride Worthy is to justify her amen and to justify you means as though you've never done it in the first place meaning all your past sins are forgiven not only forgiven but it's taken away and put in the sea of forgetfulness as though you've never done it in the first place where you are drunk up you've never done it in the first place where you an adulterer you've never done it in the first place amen where you are homosexual you've never done it in the first place whatever sin you've committed if it's under the blood of Jesus I'm here to declare that you are Justified and that though you have never done it in the first place your slate is clean don't let Satan bring condemnation to you you are the sinless Spotless virgin Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ somebody give God praise for what he's done for us Satan wants to hold in condemnation and fear tell him I'm Justified I'm Sanctified I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I'm now in the formed word image amen nothing against me amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah yes amen he always hears the cries of his people amen he heard their cry amen of the Beloved Queen in heaven and he came didn't he hear the cry in Genesis and he said I've heard the Cry of my people and I'm come down he came to Noah when he heard the cries go up the cries of wickedness amen didn't he come to Egypt amen and hear the Cry of the people in Egypt and he came to Moses amen praise the Lord didn't he come to Daniel when Daniel was crying out in prayer didn't he come to Daniel didn't he come to the three Hebrew boys when they called for him Amen in the fiery furnace amen when you cry for him he will come to your rescue cry out to Jesus amen call out to him in your time of distress call out to him in the time of your need amen there is somebody here who cares for you amen care enough about yourself to call on Jesus amen he will not leave you comfortless 2 Chronicles 7:14 says if my people who are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray seek my face turn from their Wicked Ways then I will hear from heaven and forgive their sin and heal their land sa I need a pause I need you to digest whatever I just said cuz we're taking a deeper dive now how many of you ready for another dive some of you feel like you know when you when you're a diver now you got to have enough breath amen some of you need oxygen tanks I pray the Holy Ghost comes right now sweep over you amen give you a fresh burst of oxygen amen the spirit of Truth is here come on now the spirit of Truth is here the guide is here amen don't look at the veil right now yes look at the guide look at the Spirit of Truth amen praise the Lord let's go deeper into Revelation 5 we'll see here Amen in Revelation 5 they are 24 elders 24 Elders you know they cast their crowns yes right but let's look at the identity of the 24 Elders they asked brother brandham a question in question and answers Hebrews chapter 3 they asked him who are the 24 Elders then now he says he's reading the verse for you Revelation the four chapter and 10th verse and the 4 and 20 Elders fell down before him that sat on the throne and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they were created right now he says this he's going to give the answer who are the 24 Elders the 24 elders and elders and overseer now notice there were 12 Patriarchs and 12 Apostles amen I'm letting it digest so you understand some of you need to calculate who the 12 Patriots were do it quickly was Abraham there yes is Abraham one of them casting come on people amen Church of God spiritual thinking caps now Abraham is there Isaac is there Israel Jacob is there amen 12 Patriarchs hallelujah amen let's give identity to them the prophet is identifying who they are some of you feel shy to say amen amen hallelujah you you you never probably understood it this way but I'm telling you this morning identify who they are because I'm trying to show you a point right now so 12 Patriarchs Old Testament and 12 Apostles yes hallelujah amen the Old Testament and the 12 apostles on the other side of the New Testament didn't Jesus say you'll sit on 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel they sitting at the throne praise the Lord now here's John caught up in the spirit realm everybody paying attention amen John caught up in the spirit realm but John is also one of the 12 disciples amen so John sees John Hallelujah John is one of the 12 apostles so John is taken up and John sees himself John sees himself in chapter 4 taking his crown and casting it down and worshiping I wonder if that's one of the reasons why John was crying because he was trying to connect with this theop body Hallelujah give God praise somebody come on put your oxygen tank you're going deep now amen John sees John Hallelujah you know if the prophet is making comments like this there must be scriptural backing and here's a scriptural backing for it John sees John amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord praise the Lord so if the apostles they were sitting there bowing down casting the crowns amen worshiping with the theop body of John amen and John wants to be United with his theophonic body and he cannot go there because of the breach the Redeemer so that's why when he comes out and he takes the book Heaven erupts with praise there's an eruption of Praise there's an eruption of worship Amen brother Brandon will say all of Heaven even on the earth they heard John scream for Joy jump for joy and John is the type of the Bride if they were shouting in heaven they ought to be shouting on the earth to be able to see your name in the book to be able to be connected with your theop body thank you Lord hallelujah praise the Lord let's go to the next quote there he says in 298 of the breach you know that got next to John he must have seen his name wrote there when them seals broke he must have got real happy listen to what he said all every creature which is in heaven on the earth under the Earth within the sea all that's in them heard me I blessings honor glory power be to him who sits on the throne now I encourage you if you don't know what to praise the Lord take this line that's you worshiping him in Revelation form amen blessing and honor and glory and power to him that sits upon the throne and to the lamb forever amen amen amen and the four peace said amen and the four and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that lives forever and ever John watched his theop body worship and give God praise amen hallelujah he says talk about a Jubilee He says talk about a time amen when the lamb walked forth see the book is even sealed in heaven the Mysteries are say is my name there I don't know talk about a happy time yeah he goes on when them seals broke John must have looked in and seen pass the curtain of time what's beyond the curtain of time amen beyond the curtain of time brother Bram s thees yeah he's saying John must have looked and seen past the curtain of time and said there is John hallelujah amen praise the Lord let's close now very quickly amen praise the Lord now the book is in heaven m come back to the Earth and we find the book coming back to the Earth in Revelation chapter 10 very important number now why 10 amen two numbers that make up 10 is 7 and three Hallelujah can somebody say amen and somebody count this morning 7 + 3 equal 10 so three is the number of perfection amen the number three in the Bible represents Perfection Divine oness the father Son and the Holy Spirit represented in the number three in 1 John 5:7 it says for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one amen three is perfection praise the Lord amen hallelujah that's why it's water blood and spirit amen amen perfected in Christ amen and seven is the number of completion Hallelujah the number seven he used in the Bible to symbolize completion God takes six days and on the seven day rest a complete work he done on the earth in Creation The Book of Revelation there's seven Church ages Seven Seals seven trumpets seven vials seven Thunders Seven Stars amen seven Messengers seven spirits of God when the disciples are choosing uh deacons they choose seven deacons it's God's perfect complete number am amen and you know how many of you know music was created by God we know Satan was in charge Lucifer was in charge of music but out of God Came music and how many of you know there are seven notes in music talking about your major notes seven notes in music so music is part of God so what is 10 there if three is perfection and seven is completion then 10 is complete Perfection amen that's why it's in Revelation 10 he's coming to complete and make you perfect thank you Lord praise the Lord also 10 is double five and you know the there's a prophecy saying The Headstone will come shouting Grace Grace amen amen double Grace amen Revelation 10 amen a double Grace come to the bride the Stone crying Grace Grace the Dynamics of the church is refilling of the Holy Ghost you say when was the church first filled it was filled on the day of Pentecost but at the end time the prophet says the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost meaning that come a time when the Holy Ghost will pour himself out in another pouring in the hour praise the Lorden the number 10 is seen as a symbol of completion and wholeness amen perfection amen it is used as a completion of a cycle and it is also used you know it was a cycle in Egypt 10 plagues were gone down to Egypt 10 Generations from Adam to Noah amen the number 10 he's also considered the symbols of new beginnings and a fresh start he can also Mark the beginning of a new cycle and the completion of an old one because the old cycle is finished amen the old cycle meant that the book was without title deed for all these years but in Revelation 10 starts a new cycle the book is back amen amen the book is back what you saw lost in Genesis amen hallelujah is back on the earth [Music] amen the book is back hallelujah praise the Lord amen complete Perfection thank you Lord it's giving the idea that something is done in the best possible way amen hallelujah we know that the number 10 is Divine Law Divine righteousness responsibility judgment isn't he coming isn't now this is the wicked one he's coming in a time of investigating judgment this is now Genesis 18 he's coming down to lot to destroy Sodom and gomorra but before he goes to destroy them he stops by the way of Abraham yes praise the Lord hallelujah that's why people get confused they say no revelation 10 the angel is going directly to the Jews well in in Genesis 18 he could have gone directly to Sodom and Gomorrah but he made a stop Amen to give Abraham and Sarah a body change yes amen so Revelation 10 angel coming down he is going to Revelation 11 but before he gets to Revelation 11 he connects with John because John needs their body change oh come on people can't you see the type there amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah so he's at the scene now John is placed back on the earth Revelation 10 he's at the scene of the seven Thunders he at the scene when the mighty Angel descends amen amen hallelujah if one follows the trail of the title deed to man's inheritance you'll see it was lost in Eden and it can be traced all the way back to heaven and being being restored to John in Revelation 10 who is now the rightful owner of the book amen yes only the bride is the rightful owner of the book of redemption only the bride if somebody wants to find the title deed to man's inheritance they can't find it in a physical form it's now in a manifested form because John took the book and John consumed the book amen the book is now part of John amen you want revelation you want to know the names in the book you've got to come to John yes oh yes come on now you've got to come to the Bride of Jesus Christ because out of her is coming Revelation out of the five for Ministry he's thundering forth the word of God Amen out of the fful ministry he's coming the word of God you can't get the revelation of your inheritance to the Earth out of any other Ministry but it's got to come by the body of the Bride you can go and try and find the book you won't find it I didn't leave pieces lying around Hallelujah I ate the whole book became the book amen ask me how I know you ate the book amen oh it was sweet in my mouth but amen became bter in my belly amen amen thank you Lord praise the Lord what is it saying it is saying the word is not made flesh in John the word is not made flesh in you and I Hallelujah the word is spirit and life amen hallelujah John is a prophecy you know revelation 1011 he's called to prophesy again what is his prophecy he's got to prophesy the contents of the book don't don't make up things in your imagination of what the prophecy is I'm here to declare to you that John is prophesying the contents of the book yes let me find a place to close now amen amen there's much more to go but we'll leave it for another time amen praise the Lord I'm not preaching to finish amen I'm not preaching to finish you I'm preaching to finish the devil you see this morning was packed with Revelation amen and Satan hates Revelation you know Satan becomes powerless with Revelation Satan will be powerless before you because of your Revelation so right now Satan is on the Run amen hallelujah praise the Lord I told you we're here to declare war amen hallelujah just to close up on John now amen hallelujah all that was lost in Eden amen John Recs Dominion in Satan's Eden Adam lost it in God Eden John takes it back in Satan's Eden amen yes now John you know he's called John is called the Apostle of love that's the Apostle of Charity amen praise the Lord amen what descends upon the individual and the bride as a whole when she reaches the statue of a perfect man charity hallelu charity comes and captures your life charity comes upon the believer charity comes upon the church John the type of the Bride is the Apostle of love come on I'm talking about you you are the Apostle of love you are the Apostle of Charity you'll say but I thought the edstone is coming with Charity amen you can't be any different from the edstone you can't be any different from the bridegroom you must be connected with him to dovil so if he is charity than the bright is Charity Hallelujah charity is the Capstone of the amen The Headstone come to cap the church amen Corinthians 13 talks about charity we know God is love amen so perfectly fitting for John who types the bride the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ to be called the Apostle of love the Apostle of Charity why here's a quote to close he being the groom the bride has to come forth cuz it's part of him amen hallelujah this is it is the rising of the sun he being the groom the bride has to come forth cuz it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the Revelation any others have spoken of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh she is bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him amen so I tell you the bride is Charity in this hour Hallelujah I don't have time to read the quote now but the prophet says what the Catholic church is doing is a perversion of what the bride ought to be doing because forgiveness lay in the bride they are giving themselves fathers will say go do three ill marries your sins are forgiven but he says the commission given to the apostles and the Bride of Jesus Christ whosoever sin you remit they are remit and whosoever sin you retain they are retained so the bride has a Ministry on the earth in know his perfection in know his charity in know is Judgment in his power to forgive sins so you can hold it against somebody or you can say go and sin no more but the bride is born of his bone she knows how to speak the bride is flesh of his flesh so where he displayed attributes of Charity she will display attributes of Charity Hallelujah in fact the bride and and the groom are so in Union that you you can hardly tell one one apart from the other in fact they complete one another's sentences amen they are so in Union they are so in love amen hallelujah this bride doesn't kick the bridegroom out and tell him go sleep on the couch when they fighting I don't know why you're fighting with the Lord he wants to come in amen wants to come now he says come rest your come upon my bosom amen amen thank you Lord embrace him amen hallelujah if she's born of his born flesh of his flesh now I'm closing if he prevailed didn't they say the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed then so must the Bri Prevail to Prevail means you must be proed to be superior in strength in in power in influence amen it means to succeed to be dominant to Amen to win amen and we are in the greatest battle ever fought you're prevailing over your enemies are prophesying Amen in this time and season amen hallelujah he bringing Deliverance to people the preaching of the Gospel is bringing Deliverance to people souls are being saved coming into the kingdom amen bringing Deliverance to your problem bringing healing to your bodies bringing healing to your soul the prophecy in this hour is doing that amen hallelujah and we are in a pathway of Destruction amen hallelujah Satan's kingdom is fearful of this Mighty Army Satan's kingdom is fearful of this bride of Jesus Christ that is equipped with the revelation of the hour she knows who she is amen hallelujah it's a pathway of Destruction for Satan and his kingdom amen Satan's kingdom in fact as a warning out there amen like they send weather warnings amen they talk about a category 7 hurricane amen Satan's kingdom has a warning about a category 7 stature of a perfect man coming their way amen coming on a path of Destruction to annihilate Satan's kingdom amen Satan trying to bring sickness but you running over with the word you running over with the word he tries to bring depression you running over with the word he tries to bring poverty you run him over with the word he tries to bring anxiety you run him over with the word amen you're not falling for Satan's schemes amen when he comes in like a flood amen hallelujah you are the standard that is being raised against him amen hallelujah they are hitting you
