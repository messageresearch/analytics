========================================

I pray you are blessed amen hallelujah you know today is a special day the the prophet was getting ready to start to preach the Seven Seals and the Seven Seals was a special time for us because that's why those Seven Angels Came Down Amen to reveal those seals when he was caught up into the constellation of angels He was told go back to the east for there's coming forth the revelation of the Seven Seals so he had to go west to connect with the angel amen hallelujah and no Ministry can survive in this hour if they don't connect with the angel Hallelujah if they are not following the instruction remember Mary could only bring the word to pass because she connected with the Angel's message amen now in Revelation 10 there's a voice from heavan saying to John the bride connect with the angel go take the book connect with the angel so no ministry will be successful neither will you grow neither will you come to your full potential if you don't connect with the angel of God amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah amen so let's turn to our Bibles this morning amen for the is gone away amen for the weekend amen pray the Lord will give him safe Trav and Mer his back amen Genesis chapter 1 verse 11 says and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and the herb healing seed and the fruit tree healing fruit after its kind amen whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so amen praise the Lord amen so we know that's the law of reproduction that every seed must bring forth after its own kind amen are you the seed of God Amen then you must bring forth after your own kind in this time let's turn to Ephesians chapter 1 amen praise the Lord let's see what kind of seed we have within us we'll read from verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ amen amen we are so thankful that is that is not conditional he says he has already blessed us we are already seated together in Heavenly places in Christ it is a finished work the believer needs to come to our position amen now here it is what's in your seat according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen amen hallelujah it's the father's good pleasure for you to come to adoption amen it's the father's good pleasure pleasure for you to come back to Dominion Authority again Amen to the why are you doing this to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace amen hallelujah may the Lord have blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen praise the Lord amen Hallelujah he's worthy to be praised worthy to be adored amen so I'm glad that today is a cool day amen that we can enjoy ourselves in his presence amen amen hallelujah how many of you know what's found in the presence of God the Bible says in his presence there is fullness of joy amen amen hallelujah and I don't if you know that Joy is our strength Joy is our Victory amen hallelujah praise the Lord out of your innermost being shall come forth rivers of Living Waters amen how many of you know how to draw Living Waters this morning amen amen you know how to draw out Living Waters amen Jesus said I'll give you Waters you shall never thirst again amen he promised you the Holy Ghost and he said out of your innermost being shall come forth streams rivers of Living Waters amen but if you know how to draw out Living Waters yes this is not my sermon now I just want you to be joyful go to Isaiah 12 very quickly there amen hallelujah because we all know we have rivers of Living Waters but how do you really draw out Living Waters amen hallelujah I know a lot of you will change your countenance once you read the scripture because maybe you're sad now and maybe you're gloomy and depressed that's not the way to draw water read what the scripture says amen amen let's read from the next verse but behold God is my salvation I will trust and not be afraid for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song he is also become my salvation next verse therefore with joy amen shall he draw water out of the wells of Salvation amen amen how you drawing out joy I mean uh water from the well with joy amen amen amen how you doing brother under the circumstances what you doing under the circumstances this morning amen hallelujah with joy amen amen greet your brother and sister and tell them with joy amen now come on put a smile on your face Joy has a smile Joy is happiness amen praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah now why I said I'm glad it's a cool day is because I have I have a normal sermon but then I've got the quotations which is seven p pages to back up what I am saying amen so I can preach under the anointing under the inspiration or I can take you quote by quote and prove what I am saying either way we'll come to the same conclusion amen but we'll trust the Lord amen hallelujah amen the preparation was there for as the spirit leads amen so praise the Lord amen how many of you uh appreciate the Lord for what he's doing in this time amen amen hallelujah so my title will be the Holy Ghost birthing the seed of God Amen the Holy Ghost birthing the seed of God Amen Hallelujah now we'll go to our first quote there and uh the prophet says if you want to know what stage the church is watch the stage the woman is cuz she is the church watch what she is doing amen now if I watch this church amen I can see what stage the church is in I can see what kind of woman you are amen because the prophet saying if you want to know what stage the church is watch the stage the woman is cuz she is the church watch what she is doing amen now we got a strong church amen we got a faithful church amen hallelujah amen this is no ordinary time you see the Holy Ghost pouring out in this day is like no other time before amen yeah you can't reference it to any other time before because the Holy Ghost has come in this time for a special purpose amen amen the prophet says the evening messenger loose the Holy Ghost he says denominational Rivers had him bound but the evening messenger comes to set the Holy Ghost free amen so this is adoption time this is our time this is our season to manifest to bring to pass scriptures concerning us amen hallelujah amen now you know that the prophet of God tells us that Adam and you can read it in the Bible was a created spoken seed son amen he was like God he could speak to all creation on the earth and they would obey him I if you can testify that you read that in the message amen he was an original son and if he was an original son that operated in that way but he fell from his position we must be restored back to that position amen yes last week we were speaking on Dominion you can't have dominion if you don't have control of things you don't if you don't have control over your situation over your circumstance amen over your trial God is not going to suddenly put you on a stage to perform signs wonders and miracles if in your life there is internal chaos if you have no peace within you if there's a storm within you you can't speak to a physical storm amen you first got to be spiritually calm no storm within you because the man that is operating like this is the master of all circumstances God is not going to clown around and make you the master of every the circumstance but you are not a master of your own circumstances you go read in perfect Faith Jesus lived in a world that nobody knew about and he says he was the master of all circumstances but he was able to control himself first amen hallelujah don't say my tongue is uncontrollable don't say my emotions are uncontrollable you can control it with the word you can control it with prayer amen you can bring your body the flesh man under subjection amen so we must be restored back to our position amen amen amen we have fallen sons who were birthed the animal way because Eve was given a choice whether she was going to produce another Son of God via the spoken word or reproduce a son bya the animal way now how many of you would agree Eve had the word of God Eve had the word word of God she quoted back the word yes so Eve had the word of God Amen she knew what the word of God said so we see knowing what the word of God said is not good enough having the word of God is not good enough amen praise the Lord her guide her leader Adam right had the mind of Christ and he knew what to be what was to be done with the word amen but we find she was on her own at this time amen she had the word but she had no guide you see why the Holy Ghost is important amen you can have the word but you got to have the Holy Ghost so he had the word but she had no guide amen she left the headship so she did not know what must be done with the word so the serpent found a way to make her to reason with the word and when she reasoned with the word she chose to reproduce amen hallelujah according to the animal [Music] way amen she did not want to wait time wait for God's time and season she did not want to wait for God's purpose to be fulfilled yes she found a substitute way to reproduce amen amen hallelujah amen so you know even in nature trees bear fruit in its season and we just read every seed must bring forth after its kind in its season Eve didn't want to wait for the right time and season yes because that's a law of reproduction amen according to time and season amen you find even the Animal Kingdom reproduces in their season they are not like men who can reproduce any time of the year Hallelujah so she left she did not want to wait for a guide she left the guide and stepped out on the grounds of reasoning and she was deceived now when Adam comes he finds a deceived Church yes amen and this deceived church has an animal seed within her amen she knew so Adam knew that God was going to kill Eve so to save her he puts his seed within her amen same way God Saves Us by putting his word within us because the word of God is a seed amen amen so we know that we came to the Earth amen from the Eternal thoughts of God Amen Hallelujah we came to flesh the prophet would say we bypass the AL theophany amen Adam fell away from the original faith and when he fell Adam did not lose his seed yes Adam lost his position Adam lost his authority but the seed remain original amen come on now amen the seed remain the original amen you can fall you can fail amen you may come across trials in your life amen you may come across Temptations but the seed of God remaineth within you amen trust the seed amen thank you Lord hallelujah thank you Lord the prophet says a seed amen sometimes can backslide amen but if it's a true Original Seed it must come back to its original condition amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah amen so he didn't lose his seed he lost his position he lost his authority amen he lost his godship he fell but the seed remained within him that's why Amen in this time we must go back to the original Faith amen amen amen hallelujah our birth is based on Adam's birth because Adam was a spoken word seed Son of God amen amen and the prophet is preaching a message the spoken word is the Original Seed amen so we are going back not just to Pentecost but we are going back before the fall we are going back to full restoration somebody say amen amen hallelujah amen get search theology out of you we are going all the way back to the beginning amen read the three-fold mystery purpose he is taking a a restore amen Jesus Christ Eve to a restored Eden again so we're going back to our original condition oh yes hallelujah amen aren't you glad Jesus didn't redeem us partially to make us half superhuman amen amen to give us certain powers and limitations but he's come to restore amen the word of God says I will restore sayith the Lord amen if you lost things in your life expect full restoration if Satan has stolen from you expect back a full restoration amen job was expecting back a full restoration and he got back seven times amen yes Lord our God is a god of multiplication he could have replaced what Adam lost amen but he's a god of multiplication praise the Lord amen amen amen hallelujah amen so we must go back to the original Faith amen because Adam's birth is what we are after Adam's condition is what we are after amen a created SE son we must be restored to what from what we fell from we came to the earth born in sin but the mystery is the seed of God was always within us we did not know this at first we thought we were born the son of chinami Amen we thought we were born amen the son of some men and they gave us our our identity and we walked around proudly saying I am the son of chinami Amen we walked around amen because maybe the certain family has a certain Prestige amen holds a certain social status amen but that can only take you so far in this life amen hallelujah but inside of us there was a gene of God am inside of us amen the seat of God is locked up inside waiting for the right time and season amen hallelujah now based on our first birth we can't get back to our original condition so God made a way for us to be reborn to take us back to Eden amen that's the way of redemption that's the way of the Cross that's the way of the blood that's the way of forgiveness by accepting what Jesus Christ did for us on Calvary it's the way of the holy spirit amen hallelujah this is a time and season amen for the restoration of seed Sons amen hallelujah seed Sons Spirit sons of God we have a message to restore us back to our original condition the holy spirit is here now to burp that seed and bring us back to our original condition amen amen the Holy Spirit couldn't burp the seed in any other age because it was not meant for Sons to come back to full Restoration in any other age therefore the holy spirit is outpouring itself in a different way right now because it has a different kind of seed to birth oh yes thank you Lord thank you Lord amen praise the Lord I pray the Holy Spirit will make clear what I'm trying to tell you amen hallelujah amen when you become a true seed of the word covered by the blood you go back to your innocence because what is the blood doesn't the prophet say it's like Clorox it strikes off every sin and it takes it back to the original come on now You Really Got to Believe In The Blood You Really Got to Believe In Jesus blood because when you accept the blood of Jesus he puts you back in your original Condition You Are sinless you are spotless you are perfect somebody give God praise amen amen we walk around living defeated lives because we don't value the blood neither do we understand the power the cleansing power amen hallelujah there is power power wonderwork power in the Precious Blood of the Lamb amen maybe we need to bring some of the songs Back Amen to instill the truth to us amen the blood cleanses us amen yes puts us back in our original condition thank you Lord thank you Jesus amen amen amen it will never lose it power amen hallelujah thank you Lord now you must be born right to handle the place of adoption we read there right your birth must be right to come back to the place of adoption because before you get to full adoption what must there be you go to training you know all of this right you go to training but there must come a trial a test the test is to show because the tutor the trainer now must give a report back to Father yes and he must say whether you passed the test amen hallelujah the test is for promotion the test is not to bring you down the test is not Amen to make you fall amen hallelujah Satan TS you to make you fall but God puts you through a test like when you're going for a driver's license you study the first part you got your learners but then you must go to a physical test because the test is to make sure that you can really Drive amen otherwise you're going to kill people on the road and then they're going to blame you so they have a system where they put you through a test and the test is once you pass the test they promote you and they reward you with a license amen praise the Lord so God Amen remember now what I'm saying now you have to have the right birth before you are tried because the trial is for adoption praise the Lord amen you can't be born a Son of God and come out a son of Satan yes impossible the seed must reproduce itself amen amen hallelujah yes Lord your place of trying is only showing you that your birth was right amen let's look at Isaac for a second Isaac had the right [Music] birth he was not like ishma the wrong birth he had the right birth therefore he should go to his place of trying amen and willingly he laid down his life so that his father could get the reward of obedience you see there what I just told you I'm putting it from the perspective of Isaac Isaac had the right birth and he willingly laid down his life yes so that his father wonderful could receive amen hallelujah so the new that's the birth now remember right bedding ground was Sarah he had the right birth therefore in the place of shrine he could stand the test taken up on the mountain Carri the wood on his back amen going to the place laying himself down on the altar amen why he had the right birth amen yes amen praise the Lord thank you Lord amen look at Esau didn't have the right birth so he sold it out he sold his birth right amen hallelujah don't be a sellout don't be a ishmail amen hallelujah Know Who You Are be birth in this hour amen hallelujah amen we heading to a point here amen praise the Lord so God sent the prophet Malachi 4 let's just read amen something here very quickly Hallelujah listen to why it's very important now for you to know your position in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says if the church only knew its position do you know your position have we been preaching about your position amen then expect the next part if the church only it position it will one day I say this is the day amen the church knows a position then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is amen does anybody have a doubt what the church is amen he says look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation Christ lives in you makes him the center of the revelation amen Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you swallow now Christ in you makes you the complete Revelation amen of the whole thing amen see what God is trying to do he goes on to say what is the new birth then you would say well brother Brandon what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you am thank you am right I want you to understand this now because the Revelation the new birth is also a mystery and if you don't catch the revelation of it you will miss truths about it right so he's saying it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you what is it it's Christ being revealed he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself amen so you can receive the word but without expression you see it's you notice they in one in one sentence he explain the whole thing amen amen praise the lord it's revealed yes the prophet reveal the word but the word has expression amen if we shut off the expression then it's not going to be manifest it stop short that God's purpose for Jesus Christ was to express himself to take his own law and to live by his laws fulfill his law by death and Christ God died in the flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride amen redeemed back that will believe only in the word of God and not swap it like Eve did for intellectual conceptions of men you see it that's Christ's idea that's God's idea the new birth reveals this amen so here the prophet says in the signs of his coming I will restore say the Lord what will I do I will bring her back to a original condition I will bring her back to her original Doctrine I will bring her back to the original word I will break every denomination to in pieces I will bring her back to my word how right he says maybe I better shut up stop boy I will bring it back amen because it's not for everybody amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen so we know that God sent this Prophet we just read he's going to bring you back to the original word God sent the prophet according to Malachi verse 5 and six Amen to restore us back to the original Faith amen amen how many if you like genuine things amen how many if you go looking around for fake stuff amen the bride of Christ likes genuine things amen yes we like genuine Faith amen amen not counterfeit Faith but original Faith amen hallelujah we know that after our Lord Jesus Christ ascended to Heaven he came back to live and work in the apostles through the holy spirit amen the early church was a super Church they had the seed within them that was designed for that age yes in the genetics of that seed they could give their lives I if you know every seed carries a promise amen every seed carries a promise if the seed is planted it will bring and watered and in the right condition it will bring forth the promise if I gave you a mango seed and you plant a seed that seed has a promise that if you plant it in the right conditions in the right season it's going to give you the promise which is mangles amen everybody understand that every seed carries a promise are you a spoken word seed Son of God you carry a promise amen praise the Lord Hallelujah so the early church we said was a super Church they had a seed that was designed for that age it was the foundation of the [Music] church and they had a super anointing hallelujah amen amen the original faith is that you can see Jesus visible working before you they took took note that these men had been with Jesus it was a physical evidence that they had been with Jesus it was not a guess work because the science follow them that believed amen and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen if we are going back to the original Church these signs must follow the believer amen hallelujah amen yes praise the Lord yes amen if it doesn't do something that the original did it's not the original amen amen hallelujah maybe it was made to look like the original maybe it was shaked by men's Creeds and ideas to make it look like the original amen how many of you know that sometimes you see UPC women and you think one day if they are message women because they made to look like the original the prophet says that's he ask you look so much like the original and you'll think it's the seed but it's not the seed Hallelujah the original Faith you can see Jesus visible walking amongst us yeah you become what you're looking you know that what you behold is what you become amen amen hallelujah so we always keep Jesus before us and as we Behold Him we are being changed into his very own image and likeness amen hallelujah that we function like God Amen we have the character and nature of God amen amen so my point I'm trying to bring you to is that new your new birth could only come forth in this under this Faith under this word you were kept back for such a time and season as this to be birthed under the ministry of Malachi 4:5 and 6 behold I send you put your name there I'm sending you and within you you have a seed but only Malachi 4:5 and 6 has a Ministry amen that will identify that seed within you praise the Lord hey amen Revelation 10:7 Luke 17:30 amen your seed that you carry within you could not be planted in any other age with any other message you would have been out of time and out of season oh praise the Lord praise the Lord yes Hallelujah imagine if you were planted in Luther's age and Luther came out with justification and if you were planted in that you would be the fullness of the world so you couldn't be planted in that age praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen you couldn't be planted in the days of the early Apostles you couldn't give your life for the gospel because it was not encoded within your genetics within your seed it was not encoded there amen because within your seed you had other genetics over there within that seed they had a Lon anointing but imagine an eagle anointing being swed in a lion anointing wouldn't work Hallelujah so the seed had to be swn in the right time and the right season amen yes hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen oh praise the Lord amen so the seed must be planted in this age under this ministry amen under this fivefold ministry you have to come forth in the age under the word that's being presented to you we know that every seed is unique every seed brings forth up to its kind so God designed the seed amen hallelujah so that in it is locked up qualities in the seed is locked up potentials amen and you'll never know the potential of the seed until you plant the seed yes and you need the right environment to give it proper care you need Amen in order for the seed to prosper you must amen grow it in the right climate in the right season if you buy these seeds from the shop in the back of the packet they'll tell you when to plant the seed how much of sunlight it needs how to take care of the seed amen so some seeds only grow in certain conditions and certain climates the original spoken word seed cannot grow in a denominational climate doesn't feed it amen doesn't provide the nutrients it need doesn't provide sunlight because they are in Gross Darkness so a seed can't burst forth into life in a denominational Church it must be exposed to the ministry of Malachi 4:5 and 6 it must be birthed amen under Revelation 10:7 amen thank you praise the Lord they kick the light out of the church so no one can come to life in a denominational Church therefore Mama Eagle is crying out come out of there if you come out of there I can shine some light upon you amen come out of where my people be not partakers of our sins praise the Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen so when the seed is planted correctly in the right climate it receives enough sunlight enough water it begins to grow amen so what happens if you're in a church where the pastor denominates around an idea amen puts his own interpretation to the word what happens to your seed is it receiving the right kind of nutrients the right kind of moisture the right kind of sunlight amen hallelujah that's why the five form Ministry must stay in line the five form Ministry amen must be connected to the angel of God in this hour because there seeds of God that's going to be birth to life I'm not talking about ordinary Christian birth here I'm talking about being birth Amen to original Sons and Daughters of of God Amen if you want a normal denominational chicken birth amen there's enough sunlight in there amen fake light artificial light that they got in the chicken yards you go in there amen everything is dark and they got strobe lights for your chickens and you see them clacking around amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen you go there with an eagle scream and they're clacking amen praise the Lord you show them the truth of the scriptures and they go clck clck clck clck clck clck amen but an eagle screams out praise the Lord hallelujah amen whether the word is Grievous to them or not they say I'd rather take the word I'd rather repent and turn away Lord amen praise the Lord thank you Lord Oh Praise the Lord so proper is needed for your church amen hallelujah the didn't Jesus say except a corn of wheat amen dies goes into the ground he abided alone he says but if he dies and it's raising up again it brings forth much fruit amen so you find that in seed form you can't tell what it is if I gave you seeds here unless you're a master what they call you oldfashioned word is Gardener I don't know what they call them now Specialist of seeds they can tell you what seed this is I'm talking about say you had no study of seeds and I gave you a seed you would never know what seed it was till you planted it wait for it to come and grow all the way to the top and until it put forth fruit then you could tell me what kind of tree it was amen you see this is our time Hallelujah and every seed that was sown is now coming to full maturity Jesus said let them grow because a s went forth to seow but somebody sow tears Amongst the Wheat Jesus said don't go and pl it now lest you pluck up the wheat also so let it grow so they grew with the message church amen they rejoiced in the message Church they let songs in the message church amen they Rejoice about the coming of the Seven Angels they Rejoice about the cloud amen they even were so convicted and so convinced they printed T-shirts and said believe the signall they put up websites believe the sign until they got onto the grounds of reasoning amen and then they realize uhoh I was time in the presence of the sunlight I'm a tear so rather than tell everybody I'm a tear I'll attack them and say they are false just so that I don't get exposed that I am Mr tear amen so they left very quietly so they can go back to cutting their hair and going to places they shouldn't go yes and having some alcohol and going back to their lives you leave the message what message you going back to right amen what message what quality of life will you have correct amen amen you'll know you'll be condemned all your life because you'll know there's something better amen but unfortunately Jesus said those that were without wedding garments must be kicked out amen so even if they wanted to stay they couldn't stay because let me tell you you got plucked outall so when you see them next time tell them how does plucking out feel how does it feel to be pled out amen praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord must be painful because when you pluck one a out you know how painful it is it plucked out and Jesus didn't leave Roots there when he plucked he plucked him by the roots that's why they were crying amen praise the Lord amen so you got to leave it for hours time when the seed is fully mature when it comes back to the fruit you'll know what type of seed fruit it is amen so we know that the angel of God comes at the time of life hallelujah praise the Lord the time of life is the season for the birthing of original Sons and Daughters of God who carry the DNA of God Amen praise the Lord and the faith that's required for this hour is perfect faith amen so God sent a word in the time of life to Quicken the seed that's within you to germinate your life because you carry within you the secret of the mystery of God being revealed yes am do we not just read there you carry the complete Revelation praise the Lord God wants to have the preeminence in your body God wants to adopt you and place you not only God want to do that all creation is groaning yes praise the Lord God wants to have the preeminence you have unique qualities about you amen you are able to receive the word for your age praise the Lord amen you are able to receive the message of the hour ask yourself how come others can't receive the message of the hour how come others reject the message of the hour but for you it's like music to your ears amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord how come you can say be unto me according to your word now you know human reasoning can step in right but watch how the holy spirit will come to answer your questions questions are okay because the holy spirit is the dissolver of all doubts amen because when the angel what did I I just told you the angel come at the time of life amen praise the Lord 4,000 years had passed since the Genesis prophecy and it was now the time of life to bring to pass Isaiah 7 everybody understand the angel of God comes to Mary the angel always comes at the time of life amen amen I'm saying it again and you say a better amen the angel always comes at the time of life Hallelujah so he comes to Mary and he says Mary you are blessed and highly favored amongst all women amen and he tells her the plan she asked a question how can it be seeing that I have no man I know no man so you see there very quickly you can see there was a question there was a thought what is that the human reasoning but the angel comes to dissolve all doubts and says the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you amen and you shall have a son amen amen that seemed impossible but what he was really doing was answering Eve's question how shall I have a son Adam was supposed to speak the word amen and Mary having the authority on the earth connects with the Angel's message and gives him the authority to use her body she says be it unto me according to Thy word amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah so you're like Mary you don't doubt any word of God Amen how many if you can testify I love the word of God Amen Let me see your hands I love the word of God Amen praise the Lord amen I love the word of God you are not fighting with the Holy SP spirit amen how of you fighting with the holy spirit amen some of you saying I want to be like Jacob let me fight the Holy Spirit you're wrestling with the Holy Spirit you're wrestling with the holy spirit amen amen amen you keep wrestling amen hallelujah you know what he's going to do he's going to touch you one of these days your walk will even change amen hallelujah Jacob's walk changed yes after the Angel's touch yes am amen praise the Lord You're not fighting with the Holy Spirit but you are co-workers with the holy spirit amen hallelujah you submit and surrender to the will of the Father the word that is within you is becoming stronger and more visible until you are the very image and the life of Jesus Christ your character and your nature is like your father you are a masterpiece but you're also a piece of the master amen so remember another type now to show you the point the angel comes at the time of life Genesis 18 doesn't the angel come at the time of life to Sarah the angel always comes at the time of life and 28 is a number representing the time of life amen therefore it came on the 28th of February and it was remain sunlet for about the space of half an hour which was 28 minutes hey amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord what was that showing us the time of life now just in these two examples I showed you the angel coming to two women coming to Sarah coming to Eve so is the angel in Revelation 10 coming to another woman Hallelujah yes coming to another woman because this woman must produce an original son again amen yes amen Hallelujah so like Sarah you have to you have to have faith now remember you can walk for many years in the message don't think I'm preaching an ordinary message now you can walk for many years in the message and be obedient like Sarah she left the land of her birth and she followed Abraham now remember Abraham when I every time I say Abraham you think of our messenger Bram right she left denominations to follow Abraham amen praise the Lord amen so she what did she do she left the place of her first birth and she followed Abraham and came to a new land yet she was not moving in perfect Faith so she had a certain amount of Faith to follow Abraham but she didn't have perfect Faith yes amen she was looking to the flesh we were looking to the Flesh and too focused on Natural Things amen still having mind battles am I able to produce this week after week the pastor is saying I must become the manifestation of Christ I must become another Son of God can I really produce this he's

Earth to manifest God in your age in your season when you know who you are nothing no circumstance can move you there's no room for the enemy to work in amen God can now work in your body and use you for his glory there's no self involved no Pride you are walking in humility you are not easily angered you are not frustrated but you have been built up with Temperance and patience oh yes so you can't be reborn until the angel comes to your full potential oh yes prior to that you are walking in faith but the angel comes to bring perfect Faith the angel brought perfect Faith to Mary the angel brought perfect Faith to Sarah the angel brings perfect Faith to an end time people amen let's get to the core of what I'm trying to say here now justification was a seed lther had a seed within him and when the Holy Ghost fell remember Luther developed to his full potential Luther didn't go off the scene not having completed the work that God had for him yes understand what I am saying the prophet says justification made a way for sanctification and sanctification made a way for the Holy Ghost but when the Holy Ghost fell in 1906 it fell on a seed that at its full maturity could only produce the restoration of the gifts yes which means that was all that the seed could produce and the Holy Ghost can only birth what's in your seed amen yeah amen you know the prophet is talking about this in stock tessel ask three stages there he says but there's another stage praise the Lord so Wesley seed could not be planted under this climate and condition can you imagine Wesley seed being planted in this time and this season this is another age you know the prophet there's many quotes I don't have time to go into it what does he say Moses message won't work today amen other Messengers messages won't work today he says this is another age yes this is another season amen so Luther's message won't work today because we have Luther's message plus Wesley's message alone won't work today because we have Luther's Wesley's message plus yes the restoration of the gifts won't work today because we have justification sanctification restoration of the gifts and we gone into a plus amen amen yes I'll say this again the Holy Ghost can only birth the seed that's within you so what kind of seed do we have God has planted a bright tree and he's been restoring the three tree through three stages I will restore say the Lord justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost amen now listen to Just that statement baptism of the holy ghost sounds like the real thing doesn't it justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll think there's no other stage beside that but watch what the baptism of the Holy Ghost produced it only produced the gifts back in the church praise the Lord amen so from 1906 6 to 1946 the Holy Spirit God was looking for a ripen seed that could bring adoption to the age what's 1906 you say 1906 was zza was the restoration of the gifts but it only produced restoration of the gifts so from 1906 to 1946 how many years is that 40 1906 to 1946 does it sound like Moses 40 years then connects with the angel come on now amen first Exodus he's 40 years in Egypt after 40 years he leaves goes to meet the angel of God in the pillar of fire Hallelujah 1906 to 1946 another 40 years 1946 what happens angel of God comes down meets him in a cave praise the Lord so God is looking for a man who can birth the adoption age amen praise the Lord God can only find one man that he can call to the adoption so he starts to use this one man amen amen I ask you how many in this age can God call to the adoption amen praise the Lord Amen brother brandham was a ripen seed son who knew the denominations you'll find this throughout these messages now blasting denominations he knew that denominations were following their own interpretation of the word they were did not have the original revealed word so he told us that the only way to know what the true church is and what the seed is in them is to judge them by the word amen he said give them the word test yes then you'll know what kind of seed is within them they will respond to the word amen hallelujah because the word produces the right environment for the seed the word produces the right kind of f to Quicken the seed and it Waters the seed and burs it and brings it forth so you can come forth in this time now here what I'm saying in a nutshell the Holy Ghost falling in Luther's day could only birth that seed as far as justification they couldn't go any higher in that age because out of justification came Wesley now Wesley continued with the growth and the Holy Ghost fell upon Wesley and the Holy Ghost brought forth Wesley's seed to its full potential with the message of sanctification and from sanctification the Holy Ghost fell on Aza Street and brought it to their full potential restoration of the gifts and he couldn't move any further because each one of those Messengers messages denominated they denominated around justification you still find lutherans they denominated around wsans you'll still find them today sanctification they denominated out of restoration of the gifts now speaking in tongues is one of the gifts but they put it as the initial evidence even now they'll say unless you speak in tongues you don't have the Holy Ghost right so that was not the final outpouring of the Holy Ghost so how can they come to adopted Sons amen praise the Lord only seed can be reborn the prophet says so how will you know if your seed give it the word test any seed must be planted must die and when that seed germinates to life you're able to see the growth of that seed so follow the life of the seed all the way to the fruit and you will see what kind of seed it was amen the Holy Ghost was birthing the seed of Luther amen and the fruit of Luther produced justification amen the Holy Ghost was birthing the seed of Wesley and the amen the fruit that wle produced for sanctification the Holy Ghost amen birthed the seed of Aza Street Revival and it produce the outpouring of the holy spirit that brought back the gifts to the church let's just go to a quote very quickly I'm going to show you what the prophet is saying here amen praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah let's go to uh the the Masterpiece amen praise the Lord you got it there 134 starts off he says now notice here the life that was in the stalk tessel all now ends up in the seed the life has come out of the original seed come up through different processes then turns back till it's original again right I'm sure I'm just trying to show you all that I've been preaching now is in the quotes and the life that was in the stock went one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for baptism of the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost amen made a way for the holy now watch made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself amen yes that's why we are not like the Pentecostal Church they had the restoration of the gifts but we got the Holy Ghost itself amen right it says what denominated dies like life in Luther went to make Wesley and from Wesley it went to Pentecost from from Pentecost to make the Original Seed onto Pentecost comes out of Wesley until that time so he's saying the same things again amen okay let's go to paragraph 140 then stalk tessel ask living they produced in the early Revival a holder of a certain portion of their seed life but when they organized the life moved out of it Watch The Life is traveling on now it's moving on that life leaves a stalk to make the tassel from the tassel it makes the As and from the as it goes into the original grain it goes on to its Perfection amen now here we are we're trying to get to now at the Harvest Time the seed is back to its original condition and must have all of the word in order to be the seed now you can't have half a seed it won't grow it's got to be the whole seed it's got to it's got to not manifest I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I believe in speaking in tongues that's just part of the seed but now there's added to that amen you see what I was saying I was preaching it but now I'm showing you the quotes amen added to that here's what I'm trying to get to the life not the gifts the life of the gifts see what I mean we are at the end time Brethren so we are after The [Music] Life what does the life produce the life puts us back in Dominion again amen so the gifts look temporary because when you're in your rightful position you're a God of the Earthen you don't need to be a Gifted Man you're back in original condition amen praise the Lord so stock Tel ask is dead and dry now but I like to fellowship with them he's dead and dry now I like dead and dry he dead and dry now the there is only one thing that has to happen to that is to be gathered in the world Council of churches for its burning the word has become flesh exactly like it promised in Luke 17 Malachi 4 all through life that was in the stalk tesel and ask is now gathering in the seed ready for the resurrection ready for the Harvest the alpha has become Omega the first come last and the last is first the seed that went in has come through the process and become the seed again the seed that fell in the Garden of Eden died there and come back and from that imperfect seed that died there come back to a perfect seed the second Adam the first Eve that fell and was used in the second Reformation second coming as bringing forth a child now has become the true bride again the seed right back for the original word again the Alpha and Omega is the same the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same the first message and the second last message is the same thing The Great Masterpiece of a family the second Adam and second Eve now ready for the garden the Millennium amen back on the earth amen praise the Lord so I just wanted to show you there that's right out of the quotes amen praise the Lord amen so the Holy Ghost falling upon you you have a different seed the genetics of your seed says adopted son amen the potential of your seed is to become an adopted son the mature state of your seed what am I doing I am now if you have not seen the evidence of the fruit on the tree I am telling you the potential of your seed yes that if you allow the Holy Ghost to birth you amen you're going to be an adopted son amen an adopted daughter of God because that is what the seed will produce so put put your seed through the process and allow the Holy Ghost to have its full work amen because the Holy Ghost will birth what's in the seed oh yes Lord you must be birth at this time you can't remain in seed form you must be birth you must bring forth the fruit amen hallelujah this is the end of all ages this is the end of temporal life amen you are looking at the end of your temporal Life coming to pass soon you are living in the close cling stages of your temporal life you are going to step forth from a temporal life into immortality amen you're going to leave this whole world Amen you're going to step out of the pages of the book and produce everything that was written about you because coded in your genetics is for you to become the full manifested word of God in this age coted in your genetic seed that's within you is for you to become an adopted son of God coted for you in your genetics is for you to fulfill Romans 8 23 all creation groaning amen praise the Lord amen if you're the seed of God you can only come out as Son of God Amen you can only
