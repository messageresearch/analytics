he's sweeter than the day before is revealing himself to us in ways that even astounds us amen hallelujah how many of you are walking in the Supernatural living in the Supernatural amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen Hallelujah just trying to get organized here with this distraction amen let's turn to our Bibles Joel chapter 2. amen Joel chapter 2. it just so happened that this particular thing talking about former and latter rain as everything we've been speaking about for this year amen and you'll see we're starting from verse 23 amen Joel chapter 2 you know Joel chapter 2 is a very famous scripture he talks about in the last days I'm going to poured my spirit amen amen amen but it actually starts from verse 20. amen if you're picking up from what we said on Sunday Exodus 23 starts from verse 20 for dealing with us and Joel chapter 2 starts from verse 20 dealing with us but 23 in particular speaks be glad then eat children of Zion amen now we are the children of Zion amen and rejoice in the Lord your God for he had given you the former Reign moderately right and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former and the lettering in the first month amen are we in the first month come on now are we in Nissan according to God's calendar we are right now in Nissan amen so for a topic I want to speak on this is the latter rain of branham's message amen now I'm not just talking about generalization I'm talking about what's going on right now present chance this is the latter rain of branham's message amen amen where you're going to see the former and the lettering are pouring amen Hallelujah let's just pray and then we can be seated father we thank you Lord Jesus that we can be gathered together in your Holy Name the name that is above every other name of God father we thank you Lord that we have a revelation of who you are we identified with that name and father right now we stand on the earth as the married wife of the Lord Jesus Christ who also bear that name O God and Father we thank you Lord that all things are subject to us oh God because we know our identity we recognize ourselves the Sons and Daughters of the most high God and Father we know Lord father even as you are outpouring your spirit Upon Us Lord I pray Lord that wisdom and Revelation and understanding will be in attendance tonight o God to understand the things that we are saying oh God to bring the church up to date to a prophetic hour that we are living in right now Lord Jesus and I pray Lord you shall awaken us to these fruits oh God be with your people bless your people father and I pray Lord that you will speak to us Lord let that steal Small Voice settle the hearts of the people speak to the people oh God and I pray Lord that your Holy Spirit the mighty angel of God will come now and take control father of the service we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen amen you may be seated amen thank you for that testimony brother Caleb amen truly he can do amazing things amen he can work in ways that we cannot see amen and like we always tell you be specific about what you are asking God amen amen and that applies in every area of Our Lives amen hallelujah amen so this are pouring right now what you're seeing what you're witnessing in 2023 is the latter day of pouring is the letter rain outpouring everything that Branham sowed prophetically in the message you are seeing the Fulfillment of it everything that he said the bride will be you are seeing her come to that position you sing it come to fruition amen amen and now the Lord opened up this amen Revelation to us that we are seeing the angel of the Lord in every area of our lives in fact we are seeing it in everything we look at amen some things we don't even tell you but because it's too much it seems fabricated amen it seems like we are making it up but the angel of the Lord is so present in every detail of Our Lives amen amen and we when we are seeing him we are saying Lord truly you are in the midst of us amen he is right here in the midst of us and I urge you not to miss the move of God I urge you not to move the letter in amen because when he is outpouring himself remember this is the last outpouring yes amen for the Gentiles amen and then it's going to move over to Moses and Elijah amen is going to move over to Revelation 11. so while he is outpouring now catch it in the season amen just want to start there from verse 20 and I want to type it there with Exodus 23 and show you in Joel chapter 2 verse 20 he says behold I will remove far off from you the northern Army and will drive him into the Bland Barren desolate with his face towards the EC and his eye under part toward the utmost sea and his thing shall come up the Lord is saying he's going to slay your enemies and look what he says in Exodus 23 23 as contrast for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites the intights the parasites and the Canaanites the Evite jebusites and I'm going to say this even now even all your porn sites and I will cut them off Spirit knows why he's saying that amen and I will cut them off but watch out contrast Joe 20 is going to remove them with the northern Army why the northern Army didn't he say he's going to ascend amen and sit on the sides of the North yes you know what I'm talking about Satan said I will I will sit upon the sides of the north upon the congregation of the people he's talking about Mount Zion amen sides of the north so God is saying I'm going to remove that Northern Army God is going to kill them who's doing this the angel of the Lord amen amen he is the one that is going before you now he's not only just walking supernaturally and spiritually it like yeah I'm talking about universally in the church but is working in your individual lives as much as you are seeing your progression and a rapid progression in scripture and in Revelation of Prophecy coming forth you are seeing rapid progression in your own life amen what would make the angel of the Lord come personally to you and not only the angel of the Lord but the host of angels amen sometimes it may not be the angel of the Lord but they are angels and kept around you amen amen Hallelujah Joe 2 and 21 to 22 says fear not o land be glad and rejoice now watch what this is doing this is taking Romans 8. because he's speaking to the land he's speaking to the Beast and he's speaking to all nature and creation talking about trees doesn't Romans 8 say that all creation is groaning prevailing and waiting in pain together until now what are they waiting for the earnest expectation of the creature is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen this is it now amen you are manifesting that you are a silent daughter of God Amen you have the teaching Reign all these years amen the teaching Reign was important to build us up amen if we hadn't had the opening of the seals the opening of the word amen we would be like a denomination with no revelation of the world but we thank God for the teaching that came amen amen he says fear not all land look how he's talking to creation Now be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things be not afraid he beast of the field for the pastors of the Wilderness to spring for the three bearable fruit now watch the trees bearing true fruit catches Revelation the fig tree is who is the fig tree oh come on students of the world you have the more rain you had the more rain now we are moving in the outpouring of the spirit in order to Quicken that word who is the Fig Tree when the Fig Tree puts for the bad amen it's Israel but what she's talking about for the tree bear with her fruit the Victory and the Vine I am the vine you are the branches two trees a fig tree and a vine they do heal their strength amen this bride has got strength in this hour amen amen hallelujah and you can see how perfectly those two scriptures fall in line and thereafter you know comes Joe 2 23 talking about the former and the letter A coming in the first month amen now there's a lap of a period if you know brother Brandon talks about a lap of a period between each age yes amen how each age fell in continuity one to the other and he says there is also going to be a leftover period from us to Moses and Elijah amen so yeah he goes into detail to tell you how the Luther and he calls the rain right talking about latter rain later rain didn't only fall now every outpouring of the spirit was a move of God Amen amen remember Luther himself did not denominate blur the hell through to the spirit of God Wesley are true to the spirit of God it was the people after him then walk to a certain period of time then they denominated around that idea amen so the rain is always falling or catch this the rain is always falling amen so if you've got this seed outside and it needs sunlight remember a seed needs sunlight it needs the right amount of moisture not right amount of rain but if you see shoots coming out and the plants grow out of here and you think that's sufficient and you take it and you put it inside your house you may get an indoor plant it's no longer in the right environment where the rain is falling where the sunlight is falling so what's going to happen that's going to have Central growth yes so that's what happened to the Lutheran if the lutherans had progressed they would have gone into Wesley's message amen justification would have become sanctification because it was another move of the spirit of God but when they denominated God left the lutherans and he raised up Wesley amen after he raised up Wesley we know amen the the sanctification message came about and the Nazarene message came about amen but then there was a cry from the people we're going to that just now let's just see how the prophet dramatizes us he says each one became a lettering to the other Luna was a letter Reign to the Catholics so the Catholics Harry reign but Luther was the letter reigned to the Catholics and John Wesley was a letter Reign to Luther are you following catching that Revolution now the Pentecost was a letter into the denomination and the Pentecostals are organized now what's going to happen and watch he says c c what is he expecting you to say if you're following the continuity of it he's expecting you to say there's going to come another latter rain just to confirm this in another message he says the loser was a lettering to the Catholic the Baptist was a lateral went to Luther the Methodist was a letter range to them the Pentecostals was a letter into the nazarenes lettering lettering what is it and this is where I want to drive a point right now when the church gets organized are we the true church amen amen when the true church gets organized and sit down home let's just stay home and press play please when the church gets organized and sit down home and just a big bunch of cold statues then the Holy Ghost moves out and starts a lot to rain yes oh Hallelujah I can blast it right there amen but you get what I'm saying you know amen hallelujah help us never to become dead cold statues amen May the message Church always move with the spirit of God may we never denominate amen amen amen but if you look around with spiritual eyes is that's not what's happening is that not what the spirit is crying out against amen amen people have denominated and they don't even know it yeah why don't they know it because it's deception you tell me lutherans knew that they denominated and the spirit left them right until now they'll tell you the spirit of God is with them and you need to join the Lutheran Church so did the Wesleyan Church the Methodist Church that'll tell you it's through their Church oh is it become that way amongst us that we are saying amen it's only here but the spirit will move he says when they become big bunch of cold statues the Holy Ghost moves out and starts a lettering that's why I say this is the lettering of Brandon's message amen we are not going crazy amen if you call us crazy then call US odd balls amen because we are moving with the spirit of God amen now when we move with the spirit of God we have a testimony amen amen amen we've got something to say Amen amen the letter rain didn't come amen for us to keep quiet the latter rain ties in amen perfectly with Revelation 10 11 that there's a people going forth to prophesy the spirit won't fall for you to be entertained and watching manifest in your life [Applause] is to empower you with the Holy Ghost amen watch what he's gone back to now didn't we start me off with your life your prayer life amen you're alone time with God your consecration because that's where true power lies amen it's not in the public amen that God's suddenly going to anoint you no these kind of things come with consecration these things come amen with a lot of time with God Amen any anointed man any Gifted Man any man has an alone time with God thank you we don't just come out here professing and speaking things amen neither do we commit all our times to just studying the word but there's a consecration there's a prayer yes there's a devotion time amen Lord speak to me amen amen Lord amen reveal yourself to me yes sometimes we just need to shut up in his presence amen and let the Holy Spirit Come and minister to us amen amen thank you now what we said your life your life is speaking volumes right now hear what he says your life will shine a lot louder than your testimony you could ever give your life is so loud too the people don't even understand your testimony and right now a lot of people won't where he says it's where that's where sincerity and sacredness remember now the prophet said the angel told the prophet if you are sincere in your heart you get the people to believe you and you are sincere you remember the time he was funneling that shoelaces he had that vision the two pools and the Lord told me you need to be more sincere now what he says here he says if five good people really filled with his spirit now I didn't put that word I didn't change the word I just highlighted the word but where are you sitting tonight amen he says if five good people really filled with the spirit will do more in Phoenix than all the members we got the first five bands will receive it amen amen five good people really filled with the spirit will do more in Phoenix and all the members we got if they consecrated to God what it goes down to consecration not if they go out being boisterous and tell them we are the people of the hour no if we are consecrated to God in a sincere life amen because God will move his word through there and vindicate that to be truth oh I tell you where we are in this right now God is moving his word through us positioning placing amen obviously obviously the unbelievables they can't be obviously even right now some of you are even having doubts right now amen but bring every thought and the Captivity of the spirit of God amen amen say Lord I laid on my own thoughts right now you know what sometimes it may be hard for you to believe that a simple humble person like you God will be walking through right now yes amen but you gotta pinch yourself and tell yourself you better believe it amen let the spirit man arise in you and tell your flesh man you better believe it and I'm giving you notice flesh man you come under subjection amen and he says the first thing you know things are happening are things happening amen and he says you can't hold it down amen I want those five people to raise up I'm one of those five good people to raise up here in Phoenix amen consecrate your life dedicate your life and watch the spirit walk through you amen hallelujah God's not going to part his spirit and our Unholy life God's not expecting you to come and take the book from the Angel's hand fulfill the ends with Filthy Hands we want to go to the angel and say give me the book the same book in Revelation 5 no one was found worthy to even look upon the book now Revelation 10 it must be a people that are Blood Washed both with the price amen come through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost born again amen some this is too hard to swallow some this is too hard to even saying amen amen even if you can't receive it right now saying amen amen amen amen he says the hour has come for the bride he says the hour has come for the repeat of the Bible what is it repeat and the fulfilling of the word he promised the former and the lettering in the lettering in other words a double portion amen this is a double portion anointing didn't we say Amen this would be a refilling of the Holy Ghost meaning that you have the Holy Ghost but he's coming to give you a double portion anointing of the Holy Ghost amen why you are like Elisha he says like the Garment of Elisha when Elijah dropped it Elisha picked up and he had a double portion or are you in the Elijah of the hour amen he was the type as the type of the Church of Christ Christ was taken up and the same spirit that was upon Christ is upon the church tonight the Holy Ghost amen amen that's what we are driving the Holy Ghost is in you must produce the same Hebrews 13 8. amen yes Hallelujah no when brother Brandon went your way everything stopped Elisha struck the waters where is the god of Elijah amen can I get some Elijah's rising up where's the god of Branham amen yes don't let your situations overpower you yes thank you you speak life into your situation you look at death and you see even though you are defying me I look at you and I speak life into that situation I don't care what area of your life it is you speak life into it thank you Lord slay every enemy amen Satan will come and minister to you but you bring every thought and the Captivity of the Holy Spirit you stand as a son and daughter of God and you don't give in to the enemy you don't give it to deception amen you stand true to the word of God in this hour don't compromise one bit amen the opening of the word came amen so that we can have revelation of the world that this evil not be deceived amen yes thank you amen you know what the prophet says you think things stop when he went away he even prophesied in the word and he said look here he says when I'm gone away from here is he gone away yeah is the prophet gone away so this quote is actually literal now when I'm gone away Jesus will be here just the same as he is when I'm here oh people want to stifle him people want to put cause upon Him amen but Samson will break free amen because Samson is regrowing amen Samson's hair is regrowing amen wine amen stimulation of Revelation he's striking the people in this hour he says he will be here to heal the sick to do just the same things that he could do at any time amen you put limitations of God I say take the limitations off of God this evening amen amen hallelujah he said can he heal all men of sickness can he heal all men of diseases I say all men of diseases amen he was bruised for my iniquity amen hallelujah or some of you have got to step into Faith this evening amen Hallelujah amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord when I'm gone away from you Jesus will be here just the same and he is when I'm here oh brother Brandon if you can hear me in that sixth Dimension Jesus is here just the same amen yes amen amen but the problem says sometimes you got to know how to apply the scriptures because when you pray the scriptures amen there is power in those scriptures amen yes and when you say back God's word to him watch him coming on the scene there's my son there's my daughter taking me at my word I'm going down to back them up you speak things and amen will even shock heaven will even shake heaven that they've got to come in on the scene amen amen hallelujah amen oh it's you know when the prophet says you have the power to operate the gifts on the pulpit I've seen that amen I shared the testimony with the brothers here in the Easter convention power to operate the gift to meet the need of the people yeah I won't share it with all of you because sometimes it'll be too long too hard for you to swallow amen but the brothers I did shared with they caught it like that because if you can command he says things you're bind on Earth will be bound in here yes amen amen so what about things you lose will be loosed in heaven yes did you get that scripture that all creation is waiting and for you to come to your position in your Authority amen you're sitting there and you're not speaking nothing you're not coming at your position in your Authority yes and you're making creation grown that's why it is earthquakes that's why these floods creation is groaning and you want to sit at home and play your TV games oh no I only use play my team again for one hour do you read your Bible for one hour no no I I only watch it it's a two-hour movie maybe one an hour do you actually read your Bible for one and a half hours these are serious things amen how can we call ourselves Sons and Daughters of of God and then we are not dedicated to the things of God Liars are coming in the message of the hour we have the opening of the word and we don't need these basic things balaam's rising up within the ranks of the message deceiving the people I was going to this point know how to apply the scriptures he was talking about the brand was given this account and he says this man needed prayer and he says I want to pray the scripture over you the way my mama used to say to me my mother used to put me on my lap and she used to say this beside the scripture for me he says okay do it the way your mother did it and your mother's Landers you got a sick child sick baby somebody needs a touch put him on the lap and say he was wounded for Zan gingham's transgressions he was bruised for Zion gangan's iniquities the chastisement of these my peace was upon him and by his stripes Zion gengan he's healed amen make it personal amen amen apply every day yeah amen amen I want to teach you more spiritual discipline and spiritual things amen I'll show you how the prophet operated in Practical things amen but let's just go through this now amen [Music] you know we've seen a mass Exodus I shouldn't say Mass it's the Cockroaches that were scattering away from the message when the light is getting too bright the Cockroaches will run away yes right these uh wolves in sheep's clothing because he says as light is needed it will be given so light was needed in our hour right now and the light started to shine through and penetrate the darkness and darkness had to flee he says but not all the people turned on Moses and left the word the elect stayed with him the same is happening again tonight today many are leaving the world but some are staying with it are you son amen I'm some amen that staying with it but remember the parable of the wheat and tears right what are you telling you about there try to bring your remembrance about the wheat and tears how they need to grow together they both will receive Reigns in fact right now the entire world is sitting under the influence of the opening of The Seven Seals whether we realize it or not the opening of the word is influenced the entire world the coming of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 7 this Malachi Prophet William Branham has influenced the entire world whether they choose to believe it or not whether they choose to acknowledge it or not amen is influenced the entire world [Music] every denomination has been influenced by this ministry yes amen even now they are studying his message even now they are studying his life even now they are starting out the gift operated no one can deny it that's right amen they are living under the influence of the message of the hour which is the outpouring of the former and the lettering amen where the rain falls in the just and the unjust but they just took what they wanted amen I'm so glad that I'm staying with it amen amen amen here's what the prophet of God did he says the Gentile dispensation will be in its last Church age when the messenger of Malachi comes he will be right with the word and the pride is right with the word amen amen because she is under a messenger yes he will take the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation who will do it Malachi 4 amen not TD Jakes not Joel Osteen amen not Joseph Prince amen but Malachi 4 will take you from Genesis to revelation amen and he would start at Serpentine oh if he starts there that's why they start running amen it exposes who their father is and where will he end all the way to the letter Reign amen that'll be the final Revelation given to the church that is coming in our pouring amen slow thank you he says then in the latter rain will come a Mount Carmel Showdown and if you know what happened at Mount Carmel amen the Israelites amen their hearts were turned away from God amen Hallelujah and you know they they made a sacrifice and Elijah was knocking them and said oh he says I'm even gonna pour water that's why I'm telling you put God Amen or amen call him on the scene amen amen Elijah made the scene look more impossible when he told a poor water on this thing and even God is astounded he says my my son really has faith in me amen he lacks impossible situations amen amen he got shocked when he said hey there's three people's children are telling them throw them in the fire he says now I have to go and save them Daniel was prepared to go in the Lion's Den he had to go save him amen yes I walk through the valley of the shadow of death amen I will have no fear thyroid and that stuff they comfort me amen that's Psalm 23 church that's your protection the Lord is my shepherd amen Hallelujah John so Mount Carmel you remember the two watched it and he laughed at them and he says hey they started to pray from the morning to the evening and he says oh maybe your God's gone on a holiday and he says Let The God Who is God answered by fire amen amen amen let him answer by fire for your situation amen I tell you speak to your situation amen amen have dominion over your situation before you want to go and speak to the wind and the waves and every other thing speak to your situation you say I don't have any situation look in the mirror that's your biggest situation Enemy Number One amen you go and you speak to that situation this evening go look in the mirror and you tell him you unbeliever you couldn't even amen the word what's wrong with you John was the Forerunner of Malachi 3. he planted the former Reign and was rejected by organizations of his day then Jesus came and he had a mount Transfiguration Showdown amen the second Forerunner of Christ was so for the latter rain Jesus will be the showdown between denominations and Creeds for he will come to back up his word and take the bride in erection what's he coming to do back up his word therefore always like I just said recite the word of God catch him you promised in your word I challenge God that way I tell him either you are Hebrews 13 8 or you are not he says he has to come back up his word amen amen amen are we doing a switch over amen they can go ahead and do it now amen hallelujah amen the first Showdown is man Kama second was Mount Transfiguration and the third will be Mount Zion now I just want them to switch amen now I know that Mount Carmel was a physical Mountain [Music] Transfiguration was a physical Mountain but the events that happened on each Mountain but Mount Zion is not a physical Mountain are you getting there Mount Zion is you you are Mount Zion and The Showdown will be in you amen you will produce The Showdown why is Christ in me amen or is it just saying that we know in the message all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into the church so if he is being poured into the church who is in you it's Christ in me the hope of glory amen amen we have limited him for too long yes we have put the stoppers on him for too long because later Sia has us enticed you know his latest here Delilah she puts you on a lap and strokes your hair oh my beloved tell me your secret to your power leducia is deceiving you Whispering Whispering trying to put you into Allah amen the third will be me that's the right way to read it the first showdown of Mount Carmel say it with me the second showdown of man's Transfiguration and the third world me amen as the evil one deceived the first two Brides he will try to deceive the Bride of this last day by trying to hybridize herself through creeds or just plainly turning from the word to any sign that suits her but God never placed signs ahead of the word oh I'm so glad that we followed the continuity of it amen because we went up to the word first amen and now that we are the world made flesh we can't help it we can't manufacture it but science follow the believer amen God never placed signs ahead of the word science follow the word that's why in this church we establish the word of God it's the word first amen hallelujah but when the Dynamics strike that word it produces the signs I'm sorry if you get upset that signs are following us I'm sorry if you get upset that the Holy Spirit still pours himself out and manifest himself out in whichever way he pleases to do amen but it's not our doing it's the Holy Spirit watching look what he says here as when Elijah told a woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the Lord when she did as the word said the proper sign came I'm telling you this is the proper sign amen amen amen believe it or not this is the prophesying amen come to the word first then watch the miracle the seed word is energized by the spirit there's it right there mechanics and Dynamics it's in continuity the seed word is energized by the spirit amen amen he says the age started just at the turn of the 20th century we're now in the 21st century for those of you don't know as it was to be the age in which the true church oh we gotta hide this quote from some people brother Joshua they don't believe this the prophet says as it was to be the age he's saying this is the age that the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost amen now anyone who says anything else is contrary to the message of the hour the true church were returning to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must of necessity be a returning of dynamic power amen amen amen now watch 2023 the Believers here since this in their spirit and there was a cry yeah the believer sends this in their spirit and began crying to God for a new outpouring such as there was in the first century is that not what happened here the believer started crying out for a fresh outpouring of his spirit hmm it says what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit he's talking about Pentecost now Azusa Street right he's saying it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not for the lettering can only come can come only after the former rain which is the spring teaching reign oh he's got a day in 1200 messages the spring teaching rain anytime you want to be Shout with that rain just put on one of those messages Christ is the mystery of God revealed future home of the early bride and Heavenly bridegroom the seed is not air with a shot Harvest Time amen who is this Melchizedek the Rapture things that are to be you can have teaching rain and you can have it in abundance yes spring rain when is spring Nissan yes but it doesn't stop there the latter rain then is the hour stream when is Harvest Time when the fruit is now on the tree you remember he said the messenger was so for the lettering what is sold you're seeing fruits right now I am a fruit of the message of the hour you are a fruit of the message of the hour amen why did it take 60 years amen it takes a period of time for something to come to maturity amen it takes a period of time for the Lord to sort out all our nonsense in our lives amen and bring us to True maturity of the world take away all the unbelief and sometimes we can't you know like a baby we have baby food then we go to the next stage and the next stage and the next stage Revelation upon revelation until the old book is opened before our wandering eyes amen hallelujah now he's talking about you and me he says the are you the people of God he says the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to the sage look at this next quote in her will be the fullness of Pentecost amen in her amen will be the fullness of Pentecost that's why I I'm not standing here to be crazy or to be different when I told you that Philip amen was transported and it can happen now again yes amen whatever you see my shadow passing by people can heal the sick amen because the fullness of Pentecost is in you and me oh can I get a people that believe in amen can I get a people that receive it the fullness of Pentecost is in me amen anything I read in the word now I want to say Lord that's me I want that amen I'm a demanding child amen when I go to the shop of the word of God I want that amen yes and sometimes I cry until I get it amen some of you are very good children you don't know what I'm talking about hey every time I go home science tells me shopping shopping amen that's what we're doing when we're going through the word of God Amen you can have anything there it's like shopping you can have anything in the stores of God Amen but you know sometimes I take Autumn will be what you want it's bad to spend my money and sometimes she wants the minimal stuff amen but then when she wants something I'll overdo it with her because she's that kind of a child amen Hallelujah I don't want to say anything else about anybody else I'm talking about Errol I don't know why you laughing in hell would be the fullness of pentagon for the spirit oh Hallelujah who's going to do this Adrian Gengar Joshua Chetty Sunny ganes no who's going to do this the fullness of Pentecost will be in you the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning who's doing this brother Jeff with us the spirit is driving us back [Music] the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning and watch how he caps it this is thus said the Lord to me you see I can't handle Dynamic power you are made to handle Dynamic power you were designed to handle Dynamic power of the Holy Ghost you are equipped and kept aside for this age when Joe prophesied back there he was speaking about you I know that's hard for you to believe God isn't you know the prophet is so I just got to read it God isn't going to plant a new church but it's going to bring the original planting back to original sea is this verse popping up again he is doing it as stated in verse 23. by teaching or former rain next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing faith what do you say the teaching Reign the prophet is sorting all of that out because when that seventh angel sounds the Mysteries will be revealed he retired all the Loose Ends he will bring that that open book that came down from the Angels Amen in the Angel's hand he would reveal the seals trumpets vials founders reveal all of it but it's going to produce Albus reign for rapturing faith [Music] yeah the prophet goes on to talk about Balaam now no one denies that the spirit of God manifesting in gifts is upon them but like Balaam they all have their programs amen you say they are gifted preachers that's what the prophet is talking about here he says but they have gifts you no one he says no one denied that the spirit of God is manifesting in them he says but they are like Balaam they have their programs make the appeal for money exercise gifts but they deny the word or bypass it that's what we are finding now they are bypassing it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain amen who touched on Balaam a bit now he says all that there will be a true former and lettering in the last days upon that little group Church your reading prophecy and you're seeing now the manifestation of it he said there will be a true former and lettering in the last days upon that little group that come with him on this little donkey low and humble no denomination crying Hosanna to the king that comes in the name of the Lord what's the matter what's the attraction on this mountain Mount Zion what's the attraction on Mount Zion what was the attraction on Mount Karma God came down what's the attraction on Mount Transfiguration God came down transfigured Jesus in a glorified body what's the attraction now in you and me amen amen he has a you want deep stuff Christ in the bride amen Christ in bright form too hard to swallow amen take away your false teeth and chew on that steak you are Christ in bright form yes you are the feminine part that he left to be manifest in this hour and in this day amen amen Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so what did Balaam do amen you go read Numbers 22 you'll pick up the story amen Numbers Chapter 22. you'll read the story then and who was this person that were dead raise up a man called balak raise up to curse God's people you can't curse what God has blessed nobody can stop your anointing man amen nobody can stop your gifting amen no matter how much of opposition you face no one can stop it if God calls you he is going to protect you and watch you come to manifestation amen amen nobody can stifle you thank you you will rise up to be all that God has promised you to be in this hour amen Hallelujah and what did he say you're a double portion anointed people thank you amen who was this guy oh Hallelujah amen you must you must go to Genesis if you want to pick up who this fellow us amen I'll tell you I don't want to go into all of it now let me tell you quickly this was Moab but who's Moab Moab is a lot oh come on now yes it's not reproduced and who are the children of Israel Abraham's seed reproduced so a lot the one who Abraham went after the one we pleaded to the angels to have mercy on them now dear stand and want to speak against Abraham's seed do you see it yes so the conflict that they had there where they separated remember the husband and conflict didn't end it they just separated for a season but when did the children of Israel are coming back into the land or catch it now because the Bible tells you in Numbers 22 that the people were kept in the land they were there in Jericho are we back in the land of the Holy Ghost watch baelic arise now and try to produce Balaam in this hour amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen oh Hallelujah this is an inspiration for a whole nother service amen hallelujah but here they are calling Balaam foreign telling he's afraid now that these children of Israel are going to overpower him and his territory but if he only told them they knew his identity they would have known his Abraham's nephew amen wouldn't he have known this is Abraham's nephew and if you're going to read the Genesis of that story go read Genesis when Abraham when Lord flees saw them and he goes on the mountain and he's drunk remember Lord there's no seed there is no seed promised to Lord yes even though he didn't have a son God didn't appear to lot to tell him that you shall have a seat and your seed will who did that his two daughters trying to produce seed they were doing goddess service without it being his will you know what happened in Genesis they live with their father and they produce the tribe of Moab yes these are the same people that's standing there want to curse the children of Israel so not all the people you intercede for risk your life Abraham risked his life and took on five Kings and the armies to rescue lot amen not everyone you intercede for and walk with yes we'll be standing with you all right there'll come a point in life where they will rise up against you and they'll want to curse God's people but God won't allow it amen Exodus 23 23 says behold I send my angel before thee that same engine was still there in numbers 22. these people were walking carnal didn't have vision familiar story about bail and writing in this ass you know the story to the Ramesh go to numbers 22. amen hallelujah I want you to read it for me amen I'm going to close with this now I don't want to be much longer we're going to pray children of Israel okay I'm sorry sorry I just want to tell you which verse to start from right let's start let's start from verse 18. you know now Baylor calls Balaam Bala calls Balaam and tells him to come and curse the people so you'll read now from verse 18. what Balaam answers them answer is liquid full of sin cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God to do less or more now therefore I pray you tell me ye also hear this life that I may know what the Lord will say unto me more and God came on to Baylor at night and said unto him if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which I shall say unto thee that shout thou do and belum Rose up in the morning and settled his ass and went to the princes of poem and God's anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants Within and the Earth saw the angel of the Lord what verse is that why Sunday in verse 23 amen the angel of the Lord becomes visible amen this entire chapter remember even in verse 22 that is God now giving you the account right but in the natural when it's happening nobody knows that the angel of God is dead suddenly towards 23 comes around and even the donkey sees the angel of the Lord yes amen I tell you even the donkeys will see the angel of the Lord in this hour amen read again Amen brother named 23 I had to stop you there because some didn't catch the 23rd verse there and the Earth saw the evil of the Lord standing in the way and he swore thrawn in his hand and the Earth turned the side out of the way and went into the field and they even smoothed their ass to turn her into the way but the angel of the Lord stood in a part of The Vineyards a wall being on his on this side and a wall on that side and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord trust the self unto the world and crash balance food against the wall and it's water again and the angel of the Lord went further and stood in a narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left and when the earth saw the angel of the Lord he fell down on the balance and balance anger was killed and he smoothed the ass with their stuff and the angel and the Lord opened the mouth of the Earth and she said unto Villa whatever I done unto thee and thou has smitten me these three times and balance it and Balaam said unto their ass because thou has smoked me I would dare wear a sword in mine and for now would I kill thee and the answered unto bill and not either and not and not are than as upon which Tau has written ever since I was there until this day was I ever want to do so and to be and he said name then the Lord opened the eyes of David and he saw the angel of the Lord standing away and his sword drawn in his head and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face and the angel of the Lord said unto him wherefore as thou smitten down as these three times behold I went out to be to withstanding because thy way is perverse before me and the Earth saw me and turned from me these three times unless he has turned from me surely now also I have slain thee and saved Airline alive and William said unto the angel of the Lord I have sinned for I knew not that thou stood Us in the way against me now therefore if you displeased him I will get me back again okay you can stop there brother Ramesh thank you let's give brother Ramesh a hand for reading so well amen now some of you didn't realize and it was so normal for you that this guy is talking to her don't clear the donkey's talking back to you oh yes hey he's having a company you know when somebody is enraged they're so angry that even the animal is talking to him and he doesn't realize he's having a conversation with the animal right hey but you can speak to animals amen yes amen amen you can speak to animals and they will obey you amen you can speak to a fish it'll come back to life you can speak to Killer Bees you can speak to Raging Bulls amen you can speak to situations in your life and it will come to pass yes that's true how many times have this false prophet strike the s how many times did Moses strike The Rock hey Moses struck the rock twice Balaam struck the S three times amen both those strikings two and three were not in the will of God and both times he came in the midst amen both times he came in the midst the angel was so concerned now watch if you're thinking why I'm leaving the point Exodus 23 says Beware of the angel do not provoke him unto his voice you see what he's doing here he's executing judgment he's got a sword this Angel didn't age this is the same angel that came on souvenir Canyon amen amen and the sword fell into the prophet's hand yes swallow swallow swallow yes same Angel yes he's coming and I'm telling you he's going to lay to waste all of your enemies not only your enemies but every situation but you've got to trust him you got to believe him you've got to be sincere and consecrate your life to him amen you got to have the victory over all your circumstances amen and then if you want to be really blessed you need to read the 23rd chapter of numbers I'm not going to read it for you tonight the Joshua posted some stuff yesterday right amen we'll read the 23rd chapter of numbers because every time they try to curse you Balaam can only bless you oh amen and there you'll find even there's a former and there's a letter there I don't have time to go into it right now there's a first hole to raised up where Balaam blesses the people he prophesies then Bale accepts up a second altar consults the Lord again and then he prophesies again blessings right and if you think if the type is going out of balance here because then raises a third altar but unfortunately there's no more people after the second prophecy goes for that Balaam doesn't even go to the third altar there's only two prophecies there's only two reins amen there's only two Reigns and they bail at his left standing alone with this last altar with no one to prophesy amen because after this final latter rain there will be no more prophecy going forth amongst the Gentiles so this is the latter rain of branham's message and I'm gonna make it personal now you are the lettering outpouring of the spirit upon you a brand new's message amen who is it say I am I am everything that the prophet Branham spoke about amen you are coming right now to manifestation and I'm telling you some of us need to press through because the cares of Life are going to try and choke us try and make us busy but remember you need to consecrate your life you need to have your time with God amen we're coming into a serious hour now trouble sometimes all around us don't think you may be thinking hey these guys here they're going in One Direction and they know they forgot that direction no we haven't forgotten we have left their part of the prophecy and we are focusing on your part of the prophecy we can preach message after message you're showing what the Catholic church is doing how they're using religion given Powers politics amen how they using these plates they meant to control people but what good is it going to do you it might scare you it might enthuse you for a while but no faith is ever generated by seeing somebody else as part of the prophecy perfect faith can only come when you see your part of the prophecy and you step into that part of the amen I can show you Russia's part we can show you Ukraine's part we can show you the Jews being returned back to the Homeland you can see a scripture coming to fulfillment but unless you see your part of the prophecy and you anoint your part of the prophecy amen yes amen then you're going to see your faith rise up and say Lord I see myself in the world I am the one that goes to the Angel's hand and take the book from his hand I am the one you have commissioned to prophesy again amen let's Stand Together blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] hey man just be stealing his presence the angel of God is reverent he works in a specific way we're going into a time of prayer now amen this is where true worship follows this is where after the anointing and the preaching of the word is coming forward is moving in a specific way right now amen Hallelujah all that I said to you tonight can remain a prophecy to you I'm asking you will you step into prophecy right now say Lord Send the Rain towards your spirit Lord

this is my desire amen if you can reach out by faith amen begin to trust the Lord begin to pray amen begin to call upon the name of the Lord amen I believe that all things are possible to them they
