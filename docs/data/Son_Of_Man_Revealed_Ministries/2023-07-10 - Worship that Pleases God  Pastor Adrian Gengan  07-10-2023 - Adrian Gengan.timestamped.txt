[9:25] Lord yes
[9:28] the
[9:30] [Music]
[9:32] that
[9:35] was
[9:37] spoken by the
[9:40] prophet
[9:43] [Music]
[9:47] of amen
[9:49] hallelujah amen I be thankful we are
[9:51] part of that number amen that Reve that
[9:54] God has revealed his word to you in the
[9:56] end time amen you may be seated at this
[9:58] time
[10:00] amen
[10:09] hallelujah amen you bless the ours of
[10:11] the Lord amen amen we're going to get
[10:13] into the dedication amen uh of Judah and
[10:18] I just wanted to share a
[10:19] testimony um before we get into
[10:23] that a few weeks back I told you I had
[10:25] some testimonies but I was saving it
[10:28] amen so
[10:30] amen firstly just say we know that the
[10:32] Lord has been working in a certain way
[10:33] this season you know especially in in
[10:36] the local assembly we know amen how the
[10:39] Lord has been leading us how the Lord
[10:40] has been revealing to us this year how
[10:43] God wants to move in the year 2023 amen
[10:47] and how the angel of the Lord is tied
[10:48] with the number 23 amen amen and we've
[10:53] seen it through so many testimonies that
[10:54] number 23 appearing not only the
[10:57] mathematics but also the the Vindication
[11:00] the supernatural Vindication of it amen
[11:03] it's one thing just to see God in
[11:04] numerics in the Bible but then it's
[11:06] another thing when the manifestation
[11:08] unfolds amen so we like to thank God
[11:12] firstly for showing us in the season
[11:13] where we are at and then we can
[11:15] recognize our day and its message amen
[11:18] because our day and its message doesn't
[11:20] stop in
[11:21] 1963 amen but it's present time amen so
[11:26] you would also know that during the
[11:27] course of the year
[11:30] Pastor aan also mentioned a few times
[11:32] that it's no coincidence that Judah is
[11:34] coming this year because the word Judah
[11:37] is Ted uh the word praise and and our
[11:40] worship is tied in with our Victory and
[11:42] it's tied in with the angel of the Lord
[11:44] and everything is tied into that amen
[11:47] and I want to show you through my
[11:49] testimony how true that has become amen
[11:51] it wasn't just word spoken by a pastor
[11:54] but I want to show you how true that has
[11:56] become you know when we were were first
[11:59] expecting our first child Kim and I
[12:02] thought that we were going to have a boy
[12:03] and we already had the name Judah uh in
[12:06] advance before we knew that shikina was
[12:09] coming on the scene and when I was
[12:11] thinking about this testimony and I
[12:13] thought now I know the reason why Jud to
[12:15] come this year because it to tie in with
[12:18] the season now not that there's anything
[12:20] special about uh our son or us or
[12:23] anything but God does things like that
[12:26] he he just does thing he types things
[12:28] just to show us what season he's he's
[12:31] moving
[12:32] in so you would know that um a few weeks
[12:37] back before uh Judah was born that we
[12:39] had a prayer line in the church and we
[12:42] shared with you in fact we didn't share
[12:44] this with anyone else not even with our
[12:45] parents we only shared it with the
[12:47] church and the only reason why I shared
[12:49] it on that particular day was if youd
[12:52] remember the service the angel of the
[12:53] Lord was present amen there was such an
[12:56] anointing in the place amen no one asked
[12:59] Pastor Adrian to call a prayer line in
[13:01] that day but the angel of the Lord knew
[13:04] the needs and the angel of the Lord was
[13:06] present and I felt led on that day to
[13:09] say to the church what our our need was
[13:11] and that was that in the last few weeks
[13:14] leading after to Judah being born the
[13:16] gynecologist advise us that there seems
[13:19] to be something wrong and that the baby
[13:21] is not growing
[13:22] anymore I think at that stage uh he was
[13:26] around 2 kg
[13:29] and they say that after giving birth you
[13:31] actually drop in weight because of all
[13:33] the water and stuff so if you're under 2
[13:36] kg they usually want to keep you in
[13:37] hospital and want to keep the baby in
[13:39] all of these machines and and and things
[13:40] like that so we wanted to trust God that
[13:44] the baby's weight would increase and
[13:46] that whatever was causing the the growth
[13:49] problem that God would make away and so
[13:52] you know that we gave the request in the
[13:54] church and Kim was laid hands on and she
[13:57] was prayed for we can canell the report
[14:00] of the
[14:01] doctor a week after
[14:05] that on the Saturday we went for our
[14:08] gynecologist visit this was a week after
[14:10] the Sunday that we prayed and from 2 kg
[14:15] the baby barely grew still the baby was
[14:19] only around
[14:21] 2.1 just under
[14:23] 2.2 and the doctor at that stage once
[14:26] again told us that look you know if when
[14:28] the baby is born they usually drop in
[14:30] weight and drop in size so that was the
[14:33] Saturday and the next day was Sunday and
[14:36] the Monday was when Judah was born so in
[14:39] the space of one day you know God comes
[14:42] in in the last minute because we H we
[14:45] didn't doubt we didn't cause fear to get
[14:47] into us we knew that the church prayed
[14:49] we knew that we prayed and we held on to
[14:51] our confession even though there was
[14:52] only one day left to make such an
[14:55] advancement in growth now usually babies
[14:57] grow about
[14:59] they say about in the last stages
[15:00] sometimes 3 to 500 GRS in a week we only
[15:04] had one day left but we trusted God
[15:08] nevertheless and on Monday when Kim went
[15:11] into
[15:12] labor um we we were getting close to the
[15:15] time that she was to give birth and the
[15:18] baby began to be in distress and the
[15:21] nurses began to call the gynecologist
[15:24] because she was still on her way to the
[15:25] hospital and she said you know what
[15:27] baby's in distress and the heart rate is
[15:29] dropping and they started talking about
[15:31] an emergency
[15:34] C-section and so as time went on the
[15:38] time was getting um too advanced now so
[15:40] they got came ready to go into the
[15:42] C-section room into the the the
[15:44] operating theater and so whilst they
[15:47] took her down I was still getting some
[15:49] stuff from upstairs and I was coming
[15:51] down the elevator and I said God when
[15:53] when I get there when the when the
[15:55] gynecologist comes she must just say we
[15:58] doing this as a normal birth am amen now
[16:01] bearing in mind that they already rash
[16:03] came to to get it ready ready for
[16:05] theater they've already got the the the
[16:08] surgeons and the anesthesist and all
[16:11] ready to perform this they were just
[16:13] waiting for the gynecologist but that's
[16:15] what I spoke and when I went down we are
[16:19] still waiting for the gynecologist and
[16:20] they kept on getting everyone ready for
[16:22] the C-section when the gynecologist
[16:25] walked in she looked at Kim and she's
[16:28] and she just told Kim Kim just try and
[16:30] push this baby out let's do it normal
[16:32] but we don't have to do a S let let's
[16:34] let's try and get this baby out and that
[16:37] was exactly what I spoke that when the
[16:38] gynecologist comes she just say let's do
[16:40] a normal birth bear in mind that
[16:42] everyone else was already ready to do
[16:44] the c section and they were all standing
[16:46] on guard ready to do the emergency
[16:48] C-section but there and there the baby
[16:53] was born uh bya normal birth but now
[16:56] here is where on a tie in Mark 11:23
[16:58] three and the angel of the Lord because
[17:01] like I said we can see God in numerics
[17:03] but we're going to see the manifestation
[17:04] now Mark 11:23 says speak to the
[17:06] mountain and it shall be moved now right
[17:08] then and there I spoke and it happened
[17:10] as though as I spoke now baby was born
[17:13] when they recorded the time of baby's
[17:15] birth it was
[17:17] 11:29 so if you look back to see the
[17:20] time when the gynecologist walked in and
[17:22] said let's not do a C-section let's do a
[17:24] normal BOS 11:23 amen Judah is the 23rd
[17:29] grandson of my granny great grandson of
[17:32] my granny he has he has uh born uh at 11
[17:40] well 11:23 I told you he was the 23rd
[17:43] grandson we know that the he was born at
[17:45] the 11th Hour as well at 11:00 11th is
[17:48] the 23rd is the same as the 23rd it
[17:51] types the 23rd
[17:53] hour and so then baby was born right and
[17:57] when baby was was born they weighed the
[17:59] baby now bearing in mind 2 days ago the
[18:02] baby was only 2.2 or less than 2.2 when
[18:05] they weighed the baby is
[18:07] [Music]
[18:09] 2.72 that is around 500 to 700 Grand in
[18:14] the space of one day cuz God can come in
[18:16] at the last minute he answered the
[18:18] prayers of the Saints so why I'm telling
[18:20] you that also is to recognize that when
[18:22] the angel of the Lord is here know that
[18:24] he's doing things and we've seen that
[18:26] even in the last few weeks people
[18:27] getting healed in service just with the
[18:29] preaching of the word so the angel of
[18:30] the Lord is here moving and you you
[18:32] remember that the quote Pastor read that
[18:35] sometimes he visits you during the
[18:36] course of the week you might pray here
[18:38] on the Sunday but the angel of the Lord
[18:40] crosses your neighborhood during the
[18:41] course of the week so hold on when when
[18:44] you don't see an immediate result hold
[18:45] on yes amen so the baby weighed
[18:49] 2.72 and 2 + 7 + 2 gives you 11 which is
[18:54] the 11th Hour which starts the 23 amen
[18:58] so
[18:59] then after baby was born the the
[19:01] gynecologist left and the nurse uh was
[19:04] attending to the baby and the nurse said
[19:07] you know she's not happy because the
[19:09] baby is is gruning a lot struggling for
[19:11] air and she just said you know she's not
[19:13] happy she's going to call the
[19:15] pediatrician or the doctor immediately
[19:17] so she just stepped out of the room and
[19:19] I just I was standing next to Sister Kim
[19:22] and I said you know what don't worry I
[19:25] went over to the baby and I didn't pray
[19:28] I said Judah you're the son of the most
[19:31] high God now let your lungs breathe in
[19:33] Jesus name something along those lines
[19:36] and literally a second or two seconds
[19:38] the nurse walked back behind me and
[19:39] looked at the baby and she said how now
[19:41] everything is normal with the
[19:43] baby so that is Mark 11:23 now the
[19:47] manifestation of it amen amen not
[19:50] praying but speaking the word amen amen
[19:52] so we like to thank the Lord for that
[19:54] also you know sometimes we always say
[19:57] death and life life that the power of
[19:59] our tongue and you know Kim was talking
[20:01] to sister Vanessa before baby was born
[20:03] and she said you know babies are so
[20:05] Advanced these days that they'll come
[20:06] out your teeth and Judah was born with a
[20:09] tooth which is a rare thing amen so
[20:13] there's there's so much to thank God for
[20:14] amen and if we can only recognize the
[20:16] angel of the Lord working in our midst
[20:19] amen and and sometimes we just got to be
[20:21] vigilant and you know we've been saying
[20:23] that the that in order for the
[20:25] supernatural to happen God has to
[20:27] present the opportunity
[20:29] you can't expect to do the supernatural
[20:32] if there's no sickness if there's no
[20:33] problem if there's no trial if there's
[20:35] no mountain so sometimes when it happens
[20:37] you might ask yourself but why why but
[20:39] God is telling you why he wants you to
[20:41] manifest but he can only manifest it if
[20:43] the situation is there amen Jesus could
[20:46] only calm the storm if the storm was
[20:48] there amen so we like to thank the
[20:51] church for train and believing and we
[20:54] know that God is moving in our midst
[20:55] amen so I like to give the Lord than
[20:58] thanks for Judah for a safe delivery for
[21:00] good health amen we know that the Lord
[21:03] Has His blessings upon us amen we like
[21:06] to call our pastor aent at this time

[21:11] we call him let's sing only

[25:48] quiver is full of them he shall not be
[25:52] put to shame when he confronts the
[25:54] enemies at the gate amen so this is the
[25:57] bless guing this is the heritage of the
[25:59] Lord and we see that God was not
[26:01] satisfied with Abram not having
[26:04] children it was his desire for him to
[26:07] have children and he changes his name
[26:10] and he calls him father of many nations
[26:12] amen amen so praise the Lord then we
[26:14] want to go to Mark 10 and verse 13 we'll
[26:17] read from verse
[26:19] 13 and they brought young children to
[26:21] him that he should touch them and his
[26:24] disciples rebuked those that brought
[26:28] them but when Jesus saw it he was much
[26:31] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[26:33] little children to come unto me and
[26:35] forbid them not for of such is the
[26:38] kingdom of God Amen verily I say unto
[26:41] you whosoever shall not receive the
[26:43] kingdom of God as a little child he
[26:47] shall not enter therein and he took them
[26:49] up in his arms put his hands upon them
[26:53] and he blessed them amen
[26:56] amen
[26:58] we find here I just want
[27:00] to speak a little bit maybe for a minute
[27:03] or two on Judah and show you the
[27:06] importance of Judah amen so we find that
[27:09] Judah was born to Rachel in Genesis
[27:13] 29:35 amen Genesis 29:35 says and she
[27:17] conceived again and bear a
[27:19] son and she said now I will praise the
[27:22] Lord amen amen now I will praise the
[27:26] Lord there therefore she called his name
[27:29] Judah or in the Hebrew it's called
[27:31] Yehuda amen praise the
[27:34] Lord so we know that Judah means
[27:38] praise amen hallelujah and God loves to
[27:41] be praised and worshiped amen amen in
[27:44] fact the very uh meaning of God is an
[27:47] object of
[27:48] worship so God was Desiring to have
[27:51] worship amen and out outside of the
[27:54] angels He so with the angels He had one
[27:57] form of
[27:59] worship but it was not Redemptive
[28:01] worship they could not worship him out
[28:03] of redemption because they had never
[28:05] experienced Redemption yes they had
[28:07] never experienced the other attributes
[28:09] of God that's why they will say holy
[28:12] holy holy is the Lord God Almighty amen
[28:15] they saw the Holiness of God In fact
[28:18] when you get into the throne room of
[28:19] Revelation 4 you'll see the worship is
[28:22] one way but Revelation 5 changes the
[28:25] theme the worship changes amen
[28:28] hallelujah so we find here that God has
[28:32] a desire for us to worship Him and we
[28:34] are meeting the desire at this time amen
[28:37] amen come on now you and I are meeting
[28:39] his desire of Worship the Lord says
[28:42] there'll come a time when true
[28:43] worshippers will arise we are fulfilling
[28:46] that part right now amen so God God had
[28:49] to decide I we will come the first
[28:54] time amen he says I'm coming to Earth
[28:57] I'm I'm coming from Spirit to flesh but
[28:59] I'm deciding out to
[29:01] come come on now and if he came a
[29:04] certain way the first time he's got to
[29:06] come the same way the second time amen
[29:08] because God is Hebrews 13:8 he's the
[29:11] same yesterday today and forever amen
[29:13] hallelujah amen and how did he come the
[29:15] first time there were 12 tribes but he
[29:18] chose One Tribe to come by amen amen
[29:23] hallelujah amen there were 12 tribes but
[29:26] he chose One Tribe and he said through
[29:29] the tribe of Judah through the tribe of
[29:32] Praise I will come amen amen
[29:35] hallelujah oh yes so he inhabits the
[29:38] Praises of his people as Psalm 150:6
[29:40] tells us so Jesus comes when we start to
[29:43] praise Him amen amen amen so he was born
[29:47] through the tribe of Judah amen so the
[29:50] tribe of Judah you know the symbol is a
[29:52] lion amen hallelujah so if Judah or
[29:56] Yehuda means praise and the symbol is a
[29:59] lion then you can't Praise and Worship
[30:01] the Lord and PE like a cat oh yes that's
[30:06] right stop saying meow this morning and
[30:10] give the Lord a good raw of Praise
[30:13] amen
[30:15] hallelujah
[30:16] hallelujah amen we can't be saying that
[30:20] we are from now let me tell you
[30:22] something are we the married wife of the
[30:23] Lord Jesus Christ is he from the tribe
[30:26] of Judah we belong to the tribe of Judah
[30:29] and our praise must be
[30:31] loud yes Lord Praise amen you can't
[30:34] Worship the Lord quietly you can't
[30:36] praise His name quietly your praise must
[30:39] sound like a lion your amen must sound
[30:41] like a lion your Hallelujah must sound
[30:43] like a lion yes Lord amen hallelujah yes
[30:47] oh God Amen thank you Lord you find when
[30:50] Israel was moving and they were going to
[30:52] conquer a territory yes they were going
[30:54] to conquer a land amen there was a
[30:56] specific order that God ordered them to
[30:59] go amen
[31:02] hallelujah who was going to walk in
[31:03] front amen the tribe of Judah was put in
[31:07] front because that was a tribe of praise
[31:09] and they had to lead the worship amen
[31:12] amen it was the tribe of Judah that W
[31:14] led the walk around Jericho's walls
[31:17] thank you it was a tribe of Praise amen
[31:21] it was the king of Judah the king of
[31:23] Praise King josaphat who instructed the
[31:26] singers and the musicians
[31:27] to go before the Army in
[31:31] Praise amen
[31:34] hallelujah and you know what happened
[31:36] they won the battle and Jericho's walls
[31:39] came down I know it's two different
[31:41] times but you know what I mean amen now
[31:43] Satan trembles when you start to Worship
[31:45] the Lord yes amen amen Satan hates it
[31:47] when you Worship the Lord because Satan
[31:49] is wanting all your worship Satan is
[31:52] wanting your praise amen so when you
[31:55] start to praise the Lord devil starts to
[31:57] flee that's right amen amen and and if
[32:00] something something is wrong with you if
[32:02] you can't say an amen something is wrong
[32:04] with you amen if you can't say praise
[32:07] the Lord yes there's a spirit on you yes
[32:10] amen that's binding you but he whom the
[32:12] son of man is set free he's free indeed
[32:15] amen and Jesus said my word is truth and
[32:17] the truth shall set you free free to
[32:20] worship Him amen so you find when demons
[32:23] leave sickness leaves amen when demons
[32:26] leave diseases go amen hallelujah how
[32:30] through praise

[33:57] the three of boys the situation was
[33:59] different they couldn't wait 21 days

[43:13] obedient to what God is calling us to do
[43:16] and God is shaping and molding the
[43:18] church around the world Amen there's a
[43:21] spiritual awakening there's a quickening
[43:23] amen that maybe you're not aware of but
[43:25] there's quickening and it's going to be
[43:27] a quick short work so I tell you the
[43:29] hour is urgent now's not the time to
[43:32] play around now is the time to get into
[43:34] the program of God Amen Hallelujah so
[43:38] Genesis
[43:40] 22 and it came to pass after these
[43:43] things that God did tempt Abraham and
[43:46] said unto him Abraham and he said behold
[43:50] yeah I
[43:52] am and he said take now thy son thine
[43:55] only son son Isaac whom thou lovest and
[43:58] get thee into the land of Mariah and
[44:01] offer him there for a burnt offering
[44:03] upon one of the mountains which I will
[44:05] tell thee off amen so he tells him the
[44:08] location but the mountain is kept secret
[44:12] amen and Abraham rose up early in the
[44:15] morning and settled his ass and took two
[44:17] of his young men with him and Isaac his
[44:20] son and clave the wood for the burnt
[44:23] offering and Rose up and went unto the
[44:25] place of which God had told him then on
[44:28] the third day very important on the
[44:31] third
[44:32] day so what were they doing for two
[44:36] days amen it says
[44:40] here on the third
[44:44] day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw
[44:47] the place a far
[44:49] off and Abraham said unto his young men
[44:52] abide here with the ass and I and the
[44:55] lad will go y and worship and come again
[44:58] to you now you just read the first time
[45:00] worship is mentioned in the
[45:02] bible
[45:06] amen now remember the Lord asked him to
[45:08] go and sacrifice Isaac and he's calling
[45:10] it worship am amen praise the Lord I and
[45:14] the lad will go Yonder and worship and
[45:17] come again to you and Abraham took the
[45:21] wood of the burnt offering and laid it
[45:23] upon Isaac's son so we can see this is
[45:25] not typ in
[45:27] Christ Christ with the cross on his back
[45:30] amen so he's got the wood on his
[45:34] back and he laid it upon Isaac his son
[45:38] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[45:40] knife and they went both of them
[45:42] together and Isaac spake unto Abraham
[45:45] his father and said my father and he
[45:48] said here am I my son and he said behold
[45:51] the fire and the wood but where is the
[45:53] Lamb for a burnt offering and abraam
[45:56] said my son God will provide a lamb for
[45:59] a burnt offering so they went both of
[46:02] them
[46:03] together remember God never told him all
[46:05] of this you don't speak what you see you
[46:10] speak what you want amen you speak as a
[46:13] Son of God this is now showing us that
[46:15] Abraham had come to maturity so God can
[46:18] now put him through a
[46:20] test amen so remember a test is
[46:22] different from a Temptation Satan brings
[46:25] temptation to make us fall but a test
[46:28] anyone given a test why is it fall for
[46:30] you to pass the test a test is given not
[46:34] for you to fail a test is given to you
[46:36] to measure what you have learned amen
[46:40] hallelujah so we we have been through
[46:42] the chapters and showing you how Abraham
[46:43] was progressing and how he was moving
[46:45] from Faith to perfect faith and here you
[46:48] can see he is calling those things that
[46:50] are not as though they are yes amen amen
[46:53] he says God will provide himself of a
[46:56] lamb for a burnt offering and they went
[46:58] both of them together and they came to
[47:00] the place which God had told him of and
[47:02] Abraham built an altar there and laid
[47:04] the wood in order and bound Isaac his
[47:07] son and laid him on the altar upon the
[47:09] wood and Abraham stretched forth his
[47:11] hand and took the knife to slay his
[47:15] son amen Abraham means
[47:19] business amen Abraham is not just
[47:21] checking down waiting he pulls takes his
[47:24] knife and he's about to kill his
[47:27] son amen

[48:08] thine only son from me not your second
[48:11] son your only son amen amen amen and
[48:15] Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked
[48:17] and behold behind him a ram caught in a
[48:20] ticket of by his owns amen and Abraham
[48:24] went and took the ram and offered him up
[48:27] for a burnt offering in the stad of his
[48:29] son and Abraham called the name of that
[48:31] place Jehovah Gyra amen amen as it is
[48:36] said to this day in the Mount of the
[48:37] Lord it shall be seen and the angel of
[48:40] the Lord called unto Abraham Out of
[48:42] Heaven the second time and said by
[48:44] myself have I sworn sayeth the Lord for
[48:47] because thou has done these things and
[48:48] has not with thy son thine only son that

[49:08] earth be blessed because thou as obey my
[49:12] voice
[49:14] amen amen praise the Lord amen just want
[49:18] to let's just go to another portion of
[49:19] scripture Amen in Hebrews chapter
[49:24] 11
[49:30] amen Hebrews 11 and verse1 17 dealing
[49:34] with this now here the Apostle Paul is
[49:36] picking it up he says by faith Abraham
[49:39] when he was tried offered up
[49:45] Isaac and he that had received the
[49:47] promises offered up his only begotten
[49:50] son here again confirming only begotten
[49:53] son amen are they lying
[49:56] no no amen William he's not
[50:00] lying so God is not considering the
[50:03] weakness of the flesh that was produced
[50:05] through Ager amen God is not considering
[50:09] the their unbelief stages God is not
[50:12] considering the
[50:14] past Hallelujah when God looks at you is
[50:17] not concerned about your past if it's
[50:19] under the blood thank you Lord amen
[50:22] praise the Lord God is looking at you
[50:25] the way he sees you amen thank you when
[50:29] God looks at you through the blood he
[50:30] sees you as perfect are you learning
[50:32] from this God is looking at Abraham and
[50:34] saying amen thy only begotten son of
[50:38] whom it is said that in Isaac thy seed
[50:41] Shall be Called accounting that God was
[50:43] able to raise him up can you see what
[50:46] faith Abraham had he said even if he
[50:49] killed him he knew that God was going to
[50:51] raise up Isaac yes amen this man
[50:54] believed in the resurrection of the dead
[50:58] amen amen even from the dead from when
[51:01] also he received him in a figure he knew
[51:04] that his his own body couldn't produce
[51:07] Isaac he knew that Sarah's whom was dead
[51:10] so he received him as one from the
[51:12] dead and if God could change their
[51:14] bodies it's not impossible for God to
[51:17] raise back Isaac yes Romans chap 4:1
[51:21] 17 amen Romans chapter 4:1
[51:24] 17
[51:28] amen it says here as it is written
[51:32] aren't you glad it is written of
[51:35] us I will make thee a father of many
[51:39] nations am I reading
[51:42] correctly you mean without a son God is
[51:45] tell this you'll find in re in Genesis
[51:47] 17:5 where it is actually
[51:49] written I will make you a father of many
[51:52] Nation how is God

[51:56] God is seeing it has already done I have
[51:59] made
[52:01] thee amen I have made thee a father of
[52:05] many
[52:07] nations before him whom he believed even
[52:10] God who quickeneth the what dead and
[52:14] what does God do calth those things
[52:16] which be not as though they
[52:18] were amen and then last portion of
[52:21] scripture in St John 4:23 amen yeah we
[52:25] find the Lord Jesus is speaking to the
[52:27] woman at the well and this woman has
[52:30] some perception she tells him I
[52:32] perceived thou a
[52:33] prophet
[52:35] amen amen maybe we'll read from verse 19
[52:39] there the woman said unto him sir I
[52:41] perceive that thou are a
[52:43] prophet now they're going to deal with
[52:45] worship our fathers worshiped in this
[52:47] mountain and you say that in Jerusalem
[52:50] is the place where men ought to worship
[52:52] Jesus said unto her woman believe me the
[52:55] hour cometh when you shall neither in
[52:58] this mountain nor yet yet at Jerusalem
[53:01] worship the father 22 you worship you
[53:05] know not what we know what we worship
[53:07] for salvation is of the Jews but the
[53:10] hour
[53:12] cometh that's verse 23 now the hour
[53:15] cometh amen I believe after 2,000 years
[53:18] the hour is here amen the hour cometh
[53:22] and now is when all when the true
[53:25] worshippers shall worship the father in
[53:28] spirit and in truth for the father
[53:30] seeketh such to worship Him amen God is
[53:33] a spirit and they that worship Him must
[53:36] worship Him in spirit and in truth amen
[53:39] the Lord had blessings to the reading of
[53:40] his word you may be seated amen father
[53:42] we pray you'll bless the reading of your
[53:43] word we thank you Lord that your word is
[53:45] Anointed your word is quick it's
[53:47] powerful it's sharp and I pray Lord that
[53:49] the angel of God will come and take the
[53:50] words now and bring it to life oh God we
[53:53] know father the let kill it but the
[53:54] spirit give it life oh God we come with
[53:56] the service into your hands in the
[53:58] mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[54:00] Christ amen amen amen so we find here
[54:04] that Abraham is starting to speak like
[54:07] God remember when God started in Genesis
[54:10] with the first
[54:11] man you'll find here that Abraham you
[54:15] know there's a natural son there's a
[54:17] flesh son which is Ishmael right then
[54:19] there's a promised son which is Isaac
[54:22] and then there's a royal seed which is
[54:23] Jesus Christ
[54:26] amen
[54:28] hallelujah you'll find that all three
[54:31] wom if you go and look at it met the
[54:34] angel of the
[54:38] Lord AA when she left when she ran away
[54:42] from Sarah the angel of the Lord met her
[54:45] by the
[54:47] well
[54:49] amen
[54:50] hallelujah she was a woman at the
[54:54] well amen you'll find Rebecca another
[54:57] woman at the well and in John 4 you'll
[55:00] see a woman at the well amen and the
[55:02] angel of the Lord is coming to meet the
[55:04] woman at the
[55:05] well you know when the prophet
[55:07] dramatizes he also tells us that Mary
[55:09] was going to the well so there's
[55:12] something about God meeting women at the
[55:16] well
[55:17] amen so we find here there's three women
[55:22] there's AA there's Sarah and then
[55:24] there's Mary amen and all three of them
[55:28] have a visitation from the angel of the
[55:30] Lord and all three of them prophesy and
[55:33] say tell AGA you are going to have a son
[55:35] and his name Shall be Called ishmail
[55:37] tell Sarah you're going to have a son
[55:39] and his name Shall be Called Isaac tells
[55:41] Mary you are going to have a son and his
[55:43] name Shall be Called
[55:46] Jesus amen my point in telling you all
[55:49] of that is because in Genesis one
[55:51] Genesis uh when God created Adam it was
[55:54] not supposed to to be through sexual
[55:56] reproduction it is supposed to be via
[55:58] the spoken word amen yes amen Adam was
[56:02] supposed to tell if if you shall have a
[56:04] son and his name Shall be Called Adam uh
[56:07] sorry what's his name Abel and his name
[56:10] Shall be Called Abel and he was supposed
[56:13] to say be it unto me according to Thy
[56:15] word come on can I get some free people
[56:18] here amen
[56:21] amen that is how it's supposed to be
[56:24] through spiritual multiplication amen
[56:26] but we find Satan who wanted worship had
[56:29] now incarnated in a
[56:32] serpent and he was there to deceive the
[56:36] women amen and we find here that God
[56:40] couldn't
[56:42] use Adam and Eve because of the fall and
[56:45] he cast them out of the Garden of Eden
[56:47] so he was always looking for a man that
[56:49] he could walk through
[56:51] amen amen he's always looking for a man
[56:54] that he can work through amen amen so he
[56:57] he moves along and but the Earth became
[57:00] so wicked that he had to destroy it by a
[57:02] flood amen and then you know out of
[57:05] After the flood there comes now the
[57:07] three the three sons of Noah amen and
[57:10] they have children but then God chooses
[57:12] as one specific man yes and he wants to
[57:15] start the family of God again through
[57:17] this man amen but this man is an idol
[57:19] worshipper amen so he's got to learn the
[57:22] ways of
[57:23] God Amen so he doesn't have a written
[57:26] word to follow he has the audible voice
[57:29] of God to follow that tells him get thee
[57:31] out of thy country and he listens to the
[57:33] voice of God that's obedience to the
[57:36] word of God without knowing this God
[57:38] Amen God Appears to him and tells him if
[57:40] you follow me I will do certain certain
[57:42] things for you amen and in obedience
[57:45] through the voice of God Amen he follows
[57:48] the voice of God and he comes all the
[57:51] way to the promised land amen but it's
[57:54] in the promised land now even though
[57:56] he's in the land he's got no
[57:58] seed but he's still faithful to believe
[58:01] God and at 75 maybe there was a chance
[58:04] of him to reproduce himself because you
[58:07] can see it evident when he reproduced
[58:09] himself through
[58:10] ishma through AER and God
[58:13] ishmail but when all ops was gone and
[58:16] his body was dried up amen he's now 99
[58:20] years old and Sarah is old she had gone
[58:24] past she couldn't bring forth children
[58:26] amen amen there was something wrong with
[58:28] Sarah's body that she could not bring
[58:30] forth seed yes even when Abraham could
[58:34] produce yes but now even Abraham had
[58:36] gotten so old that he couldn't bring
[58:39] forth
[58:40] children now in a time of impossibility
[58:44] no matter how impossible your situation
[58:46] is God can still move on the scene he's
[58:49] a god of the
[58:50] impossible amen if God wants to make you
[58:53] young again he can make you young I
[58:54] don't think you heard me even now you
[58:57] may be 65 you may be 75 but God chooses
[59:01] to turn you young again that's his
[59:03] choosing in fact one of these days
[59:05] between 6 and 9 he is going to make you
[59:08] young again believe out this amen amen
[59:13] oh yes Lord the Bible says that our body
[59:16] shall be changed in the moment in the
[59:17] twinkling of an
[59:19] eye amen hallelujah denominational
[59:22] people don't understand these things
[59:24] that's why when you find them when you
[59:25] read the books and you read the the
[59:27] children's story books and they have
[59:29] pictures of Heaven they got old people
[59:31] there they got young people there they
[59:32] got children there you ever seen these
[59:34] pictures amen but that's not the way God
[59:37] wants us to be amen heav will be in the
[59:40] prime of our life amen imagine now
[59:43] brother s we go to heaven and we still
[59:45] in our old bodies and now imagine we
[59:47] must enjoy eternity with all bodies uh
[59:50] that's not my God no amen amen God is
[59:53] going to turn you back to your brence of
[59:55] your youth
[59:56] amen
[59:58] amen amen amen amen maybe you got one
[1:00:01] leg here amen hallelujah but in the
[1:00:04] moment in the twinkling of an eye your
[1:00:06] missing limb shall appear amen you shall
[1:00:08] have two legs amen yes amen amen one of
[1:00:13] these mornings it won't be long amen
[1:00:15] some of you wearing glasses you're going
[1:00:16] to say I can't see amen because you know
[1:00:19] when you got perfect eyesight and you
[1:00:20] put on glasses it's still
[1:00:22] blurry are you hearing what I'm saying
[1:00:25] you're going to think there's something
[1:00:26] wrong with your prescription you're
[1:00:27] going to think hey I can't see I need to
[1:00:29] change my prescription and then you're
[1:00:31] going to walk past the
[1:00:33] mirror you going to
[1:00:35] wonder Hallelujah mirror mirror on the
[1:00:38] wall yeah who is this fairest person
[1:00:40] that I see amen thank you amen
[1:00:46] hallelujah amen maybe Through The Years
[1:00:48] you put on a little weight but that's
[1:00:50] not your ought to be conditioned one of
[1:00:52] these days you're going to see your
[1:00:53] shirt become big
[1:00:58] come on now no amens for that praise the
[1:01:02] Lord Brilliance of your youth think of
[1:01:04] how you were 21 Brother s what 28 waste
[1:01:07] was it 28 28
[1:01:10] waste amen praise the Lord amen
[1:01:15] amen amen you are 28 Wast as well you
[1:01:18] can't wait you'd rather buy some 28
[1:01:21] pants there prepare for the promise
[1:01:25] amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen but
[1:01:29] that's a reality amen it might sound far
[1:01:32] fet to you but that's a reality yes
[1:01:35] thank you Lord amen
[1:01:39] hallelujah so we see amen we're talking
[1:01:41] about what is worship so God was looking
[1:01:44] for a man that he could work through so
[1:01:46] this man is learning about God he's
[1:01:47] trusting God and and there came moments
[1:01:50] of weaknesses amen that came to present
[1:01:53] themselves where amen he lied to the
[1:01:55] king but you we went through that
[1:01:58] process and showed you how God was
[1:02:00] removing all unbelief amen even after
[1:02:03] they have a body change God puts them
[1:02:05] there in Genesis chapter 20 one more
[1:02:07] time to go through King
[1:02:09] abik
[1:02:11] yes because God wants Abraham to
[1:02:14] identify this is not my sister this is
[1:02:16] my wife amen yes God wants to get rid of
[1:02:20] the old lie amen
[1:02:22] amen oh yes stop seeing as your sister
[1:02:26] this is my wife through Whom The
[1:02:28] Promised seed shall
[1:02:29] come amen
[1:02:33] hallelujah and there you see the chapter
[1:02:35] closes out you know it closes out with
[1:02:37] the Divine Healing he has to pray for ab
[1:02:41] amen you has to pray for him and the
[1:02:44] Bible says when Abraham
[1:02:46] prayed sickness left their body and the
[1:02:49] whs of the woman were open then we came
[1:02:51] to Genesis 21 and you saw Sarah began to
[1:02:54] laugh again and they said the Lord had
[1:02:56] made me laugh
[1:02:57] again and all that sees me shall laugh
[1:03:00] because of the joy for Isaac is born
[1:03:03] into this house amen and they began to
[1:03:06] praise the
[1:03:08] Lord but now 12 years
[1:03:11] passed 12 years goes
[1:03:14] by
[1:03:16] amen and they find that the boys are
[1:03:19] growing up
[1:03:20] together ishma and Isaac are growing up
[1:03:23] as brothers
[1:03:24] but you know ishma is a bit older and he
[1:03:27] starts to Mock and make
[1:03:29] fun and
[1:03:31] then the seed can't be air with the Shar
[1:03:35] yes yes yes the Shar has got to pull
[1:03:39] away yes amen and even though this boy
[1:03:43] may have been an apple to Abraham's eye
[1:03:46] because in his mind he regarded him as
[1:03:48] his first
[1:03:49] born and Sarah is telling him cast out
[1:03:52] the born women yes cast out the bond
[1:03:55] Women Within you there's a spirit man
[1:03:58] and there's a flesh man God is telling
[1:04:00] you get rid of the flesh Man cast out
[1:04:02] the Bor women
[1:04:04] amen amen hallelujah you need to be born
[1:04:08] again amen we got too many people that's
[1:04:11] trying to operate with the faith of
[1:04:12] Isaac but they operating with the faith
[1:04:14] of ishma because they refuse to cast out
[1:04:17] the Bor
[1:04:18] women they refuse to let go of the old
[1:04:21] man amen so what is worship we find here
[1:04:25] Genesis 22 is a time after the
[1:04:27] separation from all
[1:04:30] unbelief after the separation where he
[1:04:32] gets rid of Ishmael and you find there
[1:04:35] that he's grieved in his heart and Sarah
[1:04:37] tells him I want this boy
[1:04:41] gone and Abraham is grieved but the Lord
[1:04:43] tells Abraham listen to
[1:04:48] Sarah and you find what you you know
[1:04:51] Abraham is a kind arted
[1:04:53] man
[1:04:54] he would have Laden donkeys he would
[1:04:57] have Laden cattle and he would have
[1:04:59] Laden things on that donkey and sent his
[1:05:01] son out but you watch Sarah refused she
[1:05:06] says this guy will not be air to my
[1:05:09] son and the Bible says he sent him away
[1:05:12] with water and
[1:05:15] bread he sent him away with water and
[1:05:18] bread but God will not forsake the
[1:05:22] seed yes
[1:05:24] some of us are more wicked than
[1:05:27] God but God comes and he meets them and
[1:05:30] he tells them I'm going to make you a
[1:05:31] great
[1:05:33] nation amen I'm going to make you a
[1:05:36] great nation and God blessed that Nation
[1:05:38] the Bible says he became a great Archer
[1:05:41] amen hallelujah and you find there's so
[1:05:44] many denominational churches out there
[1:05:46] the wild seed running with the gospel
[1:05:50] but God still blesses them
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:54] amen God still blesses
[1:05:57] them praise the Lord but then there's
[1:06:00] the promised seat now he's 12 years old
[1:06:04] so what is worship Genesis 22 the first
[1:06:06] time worship comes in the Bible but
[1:06:09] watch how he
[1:06:10] speaks we find you after two days on the
[1:06:14] third day amen amen the Bible says he
[1:06:18] lifted up his head amen you find here in
[1:06:21] verse 4 224 on the the third day Abraham
[1:06:25] lifted up his eyes and he saw the place
[1:06:28] a far off for two days his head was down
[1:06:32] because he knew he must Slaughter his
[1:06:33] son but on the third day the word of the
[1:06:36] Lord lift up your
[1:06:38] head lift up your head
[1:06:43] amen lift up your head for the place of
[1:06:45] sacrifices before you now some of us may
[1:06:48] not like amen the sermon this morning
[1:06:50] but it's fine amen hallelujah am
[1:06:54] amen because it's going to mean a lot of
[1:06:57] self-
[1:06:58] sacrifice it's going to mean a lot of
[1:07:00] dying to ourselves we got too much
[1:07:02] spiritual laziness amen amen too much
[1:07:05] spiritual
[1:07:06] laziness amen hallelujah you want to
[1:07:09] know what I'm talking about ask yourself
[1:07:10] what you were doing last night in
[1:07:11] preparation for the service right amen
[1:07:14] amen praise the
[1:07:16] Lord and now you find it on the third
[1:07:19] day amen hallelujah on the third day day
[1:07:24] is when the supernatural All Things
[1:07:26] become
[1:07:27] possible and what does he do he leaves
[1:07:30] the two behind the two young
[1:07:32] men there's a separation Time even they
[1:07:35] can come a certain stage in the journey
[1:07:38] but there's a further place that you
[1:07:39] must go into the holiest of holies that
[1:07:42] they can't come
[1:07:43] in it's a place of sacrifice it's the
[1:07:47] place of
[1:07:50] worship amen and only a select few can
[1:07:53] go go in because they that worship must
[1:07:56] worship Him in spirit and Truth amen and
[1:07:59] what is truth Jesus said my word is
[1:08:03] truth so they were going with the word
[1:08:05] of the Lord they were going with
[1:08:07] truth and they were going to worship in
[1:08:10] spirit because there's no man that could
[1:08:13] have operated like this in the
[1:08:15] flesh Abraham was not moving according
[1:08:18] to his flesh yes he was walking by faith
[1:08:21] and not by sight amen I don't think it's
[1:08:24] possible for you to go and sacrifice
[1:08:26] your
[1:08:27] son if you're moving in the
[1:08:31] flesh so Abraham was moving in spirit
[1:08:33] and in truth amen and he was going to
[1:08:37] Worship the Lord amen so worship is when
[1:08:40] God gives you an instruction and you
[1:08:42] follow those
[1:08:44] instructions are you hearing me amen
[1:08:47] maybe you're thinking worship is just
[1:08:49] confined to
[1:08:50] singing to coming here in this place and
[1:08:52] raising your hand Worship You Lord
[1:08:54] Worship You Lord but then you don't obey
[1:08:56] his
[1:08:58] word I told you when we started out that
[1:09:00] lots of people have gone into the house
[1:09:02] of worship but they don't obey the
[1:09:06] Bible you say they don't obey the Bible
[1:09:09] no how also they don't want to be
[1:09:11] baptized according to acts 238 repent
[1:09:15] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:09:17] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:21] Christ amen no we love the we We Love to
[1:09:25] Worship but you're not obeying the word
[1:09:27] worship is obeying the word amen amen
[1:09:33] hey now they got now they got amen
[1:09:37] Bishop
[1:09:39] after and Pastor
[1:09:44] Mara every wife of every Pastor becomes
[1:09:48] a
[1:09:49] pastor but they're not obeying the
[1:09:52] master because the master says I suffer
[1:09:54] a woman not to teach or Ser authority
[1:09:57] over a man no but we love God but you
[1:09:59] don't love his
[1:10:00] word that's
[1:10:03] correct we just love this Divine beings
[1:10:06] we love to imagine three Gods we are
[1:10:08] Idol worshippers we love three
[1:10:15] Gods but the Bible says here oh Israel
[1:10:18] the Lord thy God is one
[1:10:20] Lord amen there's no EX in this hour
[1:10:24] after Revelation 10:7 is is fulfilled
[1:10:27] because Revelation 10 the prophet was
[1:10:30] supposed to reveal the mystery of God
[1:10:32] and he told you how God was
[1:10:33] condescending from Spirit to word to
[1:10:35] flesh it's one God changing form amen
[1:10:39] amen for you younger people if you're
[1:10:40] doing a play one person can take three
[1:10:43] different parts in the play they can go
[1:10:45] change their costume and come back so
[1:10:48] God was a spirit wanted to condescend
[1:10:50] because man had fallen so he came from
[1:10:53] Spirit to word to flesh amen that's why
[1:10:56] John 1 says that in the beginning amen
[1:10:59] the Word was God and the Word was with
[1:11:01] God the word became flesh and dwelt
[1:11:03] amongst us amen you see these things
[1:11:05] that are common to us because the eyes
[1:11:07] of our understanding have become open
[1:11:09] this is a veil to most people they can't
[1:11:11] see it thank you Lord thank you Lord but
[1:11:14] it's the word of God yes thank you
[1:11:17] Lord amen amen hallelujah you find why
[1:11:22] most marriages fail they don't have
[1:11:23] Christ as the head of the house they
[1:11:26] don't have the husband as the head of
[1:11:27] the home they don't have the wife amen
[1:11:31] and then the children they don't have
[1:11:32] the biblical pattern for marriage amen
[1:11:36] so the man is subject to Christ amen the
[1:11:39] man is not ruling without Christ if a
[1:11:41] man wants to rule his home he's got to
[1:11:43] have Christ as his
[1:11:45] Ed hello if a man wants to have
[1:11:49] rulership over his home he's got to have
[1:11:50] Christ as the
[1:11:52] head and you saying where do I find
[1:11:54] Christ yes
[1:11:56] Christ so if this is not your head and
[1:11:59] you're not taking instruction from the
[1:12:00] word of God how are you leading your
[1:12:03] home amen how are you leading your
[1:12:07] home some of you don't like this
[1:12:09] practical teaching amen but even in
[1:12:11] marriage you could stand there before
[1:12:12] the the pastor and you want to get
[1:12:14] married and the pastor tells you it's a
[1:12:15] three cord
[1:12:17] Union it's you your spouse and Christ
[1:12:22] but you are thinking now Christ is
[1:12:23] descend from the heavens into your
[1:12:25] home and this is never read between you
[1:12:28] and the wife this is never read in your
[1:12:33] home amen amen
[1:12:38] hallelujah this is the cord third chord
[1:12:42] the word of God am how many of you know
[1:12:44] this is no different to
[1:12:46] God his word
[1:12:50] amen amen this is the written form of
[1:12:53] his
[1:12:54] word amen to obey this is true
[1:12:57] worship you say are you saying that I
[1:12:59] thought I can just come and raise my
[1:13:02] hands hey I want a form of godliness I
[1:13:04] want everyone to see I'm going that's
[1:13:06] why when you're walking in the morning

[1:13:42] morning hey but worship is when God
[1:13:45] gives you an instruction and you follow
[1:13:47] it amen that's true worship to obey the
[1:13:51] voice of God Amen Amen to follow those
[1:13:54] instructions and in worship there's got
[1:13:56] to be death cuz you find there was going
[1:13:58] to be death in the
[1:14:00] scene in worship there's got to be dead
[1:14:03] to self amen the flesh man does not want
[1:14:06] to follow the instruction of God but the
[1:14:08] spirit man loves the instruction of God
[1:14:10] and says not my will but thy will be
[1:14:14] done amen I'm willing to crucify myself
[1:14:17] that's why the Apostle Paul says I Die
[1:14:20] daily amen amen yes amen that proves you
[1:14:24] love him that proves you worship Him in
[1:14:26] spirit and in truth amen that is worship
[1:14:28] obedience to the word of God without
[1:14:30] questioning obedience to the word of God
[1:14:33] without wavering yes amen the Bible says
[1:14:36] forsake not the assemblying together of
[1:14:37] yourselves even as you see the day fast
[1:14:40] approaching or he says even as the
[1:14:41] manner of some
[1:14:45] is but I put reason to it then you're
[1:14:48] now like Eve reasoning with the word
[1:14:52] amen now you're like you like Eve when
[1:14:55] you when you say you know Paul was
[1:14:56] writing to those church people there you
[1:14:58] know they were a bit oldfashioned

[1:15:45] they want to go after the things of the
[1:15:47] world Amen
[1:15:50] Hallelujah but we've got to come to a
[1:15:52] place where we lay down our own
[1:15:53] Ambitions and our desires and say not
[1:15:56] the flesh man rule this heart you know
[1:15:59] God wants rulership of our hearts yes
[1:16:01] amen but let Christ take this place the
[1:16:04] Throne of our heart Amen Let Christ
[1:16:06] reign supreme amen so give no no place
[1:16:10] for the flesh to dominate me and have
[1:16:12] control over me I know what I'm talking
[1:16:14] about it's an our
[1:16:16] age it's the easiest age to satisfy the
[1:16:20] flesh Amen in an age of entertainment
[1:16:24] in an age where communication is easy in
[1:16:26] an age where amen it's so easy to to
[1:16:29] occupy your mind with other things the
[1:16:32] word of God has taken second place in
[1:16:34] most people's lives if it's there second
[1:16:38] place amen but the word of God comes to
[1:16:41] Abraham and by the spirit of God he's
[1:16:44] willing to go and do what God asked him
[1:16:46] to do without telling Sarah what he was
[1:16:49] going to do amen
[1:16:52] yes
[1:16:53] you know I was reading brother Joshua
[1:16:55] was telling me about this book of jesa

[1:17:03] there you you'll read a more dramatic
[1:17:06] account of

[1:17:11] chapter actually there it's chapter 23
[1:17:14] that they
[1:17:15] sacrifice it's chapter 23 right that
[1:17:18] they sacrifice Isaac here it's chapter
[1:17:19] 22 but in the book of josua it falls in
[1:17:22] chapter 23 there but you'll find there
[1:17:25] how Sarah goes I'm just quoting the book
[1:17:28] of jasher now to you Sarah goes looking
[1:17:31] because she finally realized what
[1:17:32] Abraham's about to
[1:17:34] do and she goes pursuing them trying to
[1:17:37] find
[1:17:39] him
[1:17:41] amen because what Abraham was doing was
[1:17:43] not a normal thing you got to be a man
[1:17:46] of Faith amen you got to have heard from
[1:17:48] God himself and you got to be able to
[1:17:50] recognize the voice of God to do what he

[1:17:56] son amen SAR would have told him have

[1:18:10] sure it wasn't the devil speaking to
[1:18:14] you
[1:18:16] amen we find amen there's certain places
[1:18:20] that only you and your sacrifice can go
[1:18:22] am
[1:18:24] worship is between you and
[1:18:26] God that is why you can't depend on the
[1:18:30] opinion if your father your mother your

[1:18:34] and God Amen you can't take their
[1:18:38] opinion through Worship You must enter

[1:31:38] your wife you can't listen to anybody
[1:31:40] else it's between you and God
[1:31:44] Amen and we find
[1:31:46] here that the Apostle Paul is picking it
[1:31:49] up and he says that Abraham believed
[1:31:50] that he was able to raise ra him up from
[1:31:52] the
[1:31:53] dead your situation that you're going
[1:31:55] through maybe you feel it's hopeless you
[1:31:57] feel maybe you're too old you're too
[1:31:59] young whatever it is the time is gone

[1:32:16] over your
[1:32:17] situation amen how about calling Jehovah
[1:32:20] Gyra on the scene and say that my God
[1:32:22] shall provide
[1:32:26] himself amen hallelujah
[1:32:31] amen oh yes so worship is based on
[1:32:35] obeying God's word what's in the Bible
[1:32:38] and Abraham we know he lived by faith
[1:32:39] and not by sight amen when he was tried
[1:32:42] and tested offered up Isaac and he
[1:32:44] received the promises of
[1:32:46] God and so will you if you walking in
[1:32:49] faith you are backed by the promises of
[1:32:51] God Amen
[1:32:52] not one word will fail you heavens and
[1:32:54] earth will pass away but my word will
[1:32:56] not fail you God's word will never fail
[1:32:58] you you can rest your promises you can
[1:33:00] rest your entire life on the word of God
[1:33:03] Amen
[1:33:10] Hallelujah you see we need to move our
[1:33:12] faith into another level what is
[1:33:15] believing believing is not just saying
[1:33:17] I'm believing believing is taking the
[1:33:21] relevant action required doesn't isn't
[1:33:25] there message hearing recognizing acting
[1:33:27] on the word of God acting that's true
[1:33:31] believing anyone can say I believe the
[1:33:33] word of God but they never act on it you
[1:33:36] know anyone can say I believe in baptism
[1:33:38] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:33:40] they never act on it and they never
[1:33:42] physically get baptized is that
[1:33:43] believing
[1:33:45] no so believing results in a
[1:33:48] corresponding
[1:33:49] action yes true believing results in a
[1:33:53] corresponding action you can't say I
[1:33:55] believe this and then you remain in your
[1:33:57] old
[1:33:58] house you got to come out of her my
[1:34:01] people amen be not partakers of her sins
[1:34:06] amen hallelujah amen so Abraham knew the
[1:34:09] promise of God that said I'm going to I
[1:34:11] have made the a father of many nations
[1:34:13] so he knew that no way was Isa going to
[1:34:15] be
[1:34:18] dead so it's with you in your situation
[1:34:22] there's no way that your situation will
[1:34:25] not be met your need will not be met
[1:34:27] because God has already given you his
[1:34:29] promise in his word don't ask questions
[1:34:31] how amen when you go and and start to
[1:34:33] reason you're moving into unbelief amen
[1:34:35] don't question how be ready to worship
[1:34:37] amen be ready to obey the word of God
[1:34:41] Amen you told me to worship and you told
[1:34:44] me to worship by killing my son that's
[1:34:46] how I'm going to worship you in a way
[1:34:48] that's called ay that's the way we
[1:34:49] worship the god of our fathers amen
[1:34:53] amen glory be to his name amen you know
[1:34:57] there's something between
[1:35:00] Faith there there's a difference between
[1:35:02] faith and
[1:35:03] trust how many if you know that there
[1:35:06] was this man very quickly we'll close on
[1:35:08] this there was a man his name was called
[1:35:11] blondon and he had a tight rope moving
[1:35:14] from America to
[1:35:16] Canada and it was a great feat in the
[1:35:18] 1800s he would walk this tight rope and
[1:35:21] he would walk it blindfolded and he
[1:35:23] would do back flips on it and he would
[1:35:25] push a wheelbarrow over it and he even
[1:35:27] cooked an omelet one day while walking
[1:35:29] through
[1:35:31] this how many if you want to try the tit
[1:35:35] Trope
[1:35:36] amen now he had faith that he could
[1:35:39] accomplish his
[1:35:40] Feats he had real faith that he could do
[1:35:43] it amen and he trusted in his abilities
[1:35:47] to complete
[1:35:49] them but The
[1:35:52] Spectators only had Faith they didn't
[1:35:55] have
[1:35:57] trust you see you can have faith but you
[1:36:00] need trust as
[1:36:02] well trust is another level that's what
[1:36:05] Abraham had he trusted the
[1:36:07] God that he had faith in can you trust
[1:36:10] the god that you have faith
[1:36:12] in because some people say I have faith
[1:36:15] in God but they still move on their own
[1:36:17] steam because they don't trust him they
[1:36:20] still got the hand in the situation
[1:36:22] because they don't trust
[1:36:24] him so there was another man called Eric
[1:36:28] kod one day you see all of these
[1:36:30] Spectators that came to watch him and
[1:36:32] applaud him they never trusted
[1:36:34] him but one man who had faith in blondon
[1:36:39] cul one day The Spectators saw that this
[1:36:43] man was hanging on the
[1:36:50] back
[1:36:51] you know what I'm talking about they
[1:36:52] call it
[1:36:54] balata he was doing
[1:36:57] piggyback piggy
[1:36:59] [Music]
[1:37:01] back how many of you would go and jump
[1:37:04] on a man's back who's walking a tit
[1:37:07] TR so you don't have
[1:37:09] trust so you see this man moved from
[1:37:12] faith in this man to trust in
[1:37:14] him and he jumped on his back and this
[1:37:17] man is walking the tit R and how was it
[1:37:21] successful they interviewed him after
[1:37:23] that he says well blondon the man who
[1:37:25] was walking in the tight TR told me you
[1:37:27] are no longer call
[1:37:30] Cord you are now blondon you become one
[1:37:33] with me oh
[1:37:36] yes amen he told him until I clear the
[1:37:40] spot amen if I sway you sway with
[1:37:44] me you don't try to balance on your
[1:37:47] own whatever movements I make you just
[1:37:49] let your body lay limp on me me trust me
[1:37:53] amen and I'll get you over this oh yes
[1:37:56] that's the difference between faith and
[1:37:58] trust the spectators had faith in the
[1:38:01] man and believed in his ability but only
[1:38:03] car cord trusted him enough to climb on
[1:38:06] his back and allow him to carry him
[1:38:09] through that's what we need to trust God
[1:38:12] like amen praise the
[1:38:15] Lord amen you know there's many styles
[1:38:18] when we're coming back to praise and
[1:38:19] worship now in the church
[1:38:21] people think
[1:38:22] oh God is not moved that's why God is
[1:38:25] telling now the woman at the
[1:38:27] well you say that you Worship in this
[1:38:30] mountain he's saying you know not who
[1:38:32] you worship God is not interested in the
[1:38:35] worship of Man based on
[1:38:41] Traditions God is not looking for an
[1:38:43] Indian style of
[1:38:45] worship he's not looking for a black
[1:38:47] style of worship amen because you know
[1:38:49] people confus that oh I like how the
[1:38:51] blacks worship no we just told you what
[1:38:53] true worship is oh I like it how the
[1:38:56] whites worship I like it how the col's
[1:38:58] worship
[1:39:01] no God is looking for Spirit style
[1:39:04] worship
[1:39:06] amen a worship that's not coming from a
[1:39:09] cultural type of worship God is looking
[1:39:11] for Spirit Worship truth worship amen
[1:39:15] the one that goes beyond the flesh am
[1:39:18] you know a lot of people who are moving
[1:39:19] like this
[1:39:25] doesn't mean that they are worshiping
[1:39:28] amen maybe they're moving to a beat and
[1:39:31] now you watch a lot of worldly Styles
[1:39:32] and dances have got into the
[1:39:35] churches they bringing those styles from
[1:39:37] the world into the church right amen and
[1:39:41] they want to bring those moves into the
[1:39:44] church it goes beyond the Flesh and the
[1:39:46] way we feel about it amen what we think
[1:39:50] is the right Style and type of worship
[1:39:52] worship is to God Amen
[1:39:56] hello worship is never based on our
[1:39:59] Judgment of what it is or what it should
[1:40:01] look like hello yes yes so why do we
[1:40:05] stand in it and say ah uh worship is to
[1:40:08] God and it's directed to God and has
[1:40:10] nothing to do what we like or don't
[1:40:15] like you find many times we have a lot
[1:40:18] to say about worship we can criticize
[1:40:20] people in the way they
[1:40:22] worship and you find many times amen the
[1:40:24] worship is not directed to you so why
[1:40:27] you got a problem with it right it's
[1:40:30] directed to God Amen so we should not
[1:40:32] have an opinion about it amen and that's
[1:40:36] how the devil is robbing you of
[1:40:38] worshiping just because somebody is
[1:40:41] dancing and shouting and screaming it
[1:40:44] does not mean that they are worshiping
[1:40:46] it could just be fleshly emotions that
[1:40:48] are carried away by the music but true
[1:40:50] worship comes from the innermost being
[1:40:52] of a person true worship is from the
[1:40:54] spirit of man man that is created in
[1:40:56] spirit being amen he created in the
[1:40:59] image and likeness of God so man must
[1:41:01] Worship in spirit he says God is spirit
[1:41:05] and they that worship must worship Him
[1:41:07] in spirit and in truth yes no problem I
[1:41:11] like to
[1:41:12] dance but make sure your spirit is
[1:41:14] worshiping inside of

[1:41:35] we must engage our own being our hearts
[1:41:37] mind Souls body and spirit amen true
[1:41:40] worship is not limited to external
[1:41:43] actions or rituals but involves a deep a
[1:41:47] deep worship from within it says
[1:41:50] therefore I urge you you Brothers in the
[1:41:51] view of God's mercy to offer your bodies
[1:41:53] as living sacrifices holy and pleasing
[1:41:56] to God that is your spiritual
[1:41:59] sacrifice and do not conform to the
[1:42:02] pattern of this world but be transformed
[1:42:04] by the renewing of your
[1:42:06] mind amen so worship is something amen

[1:44:38] pleases God and it'll take great
[1:44:40] sacrifice to get into a worship that
[1:44:43] pleases God and full obedience to the
[1:44:46] word is what true worship is all about
[1:44:48] and full obedience to the word entitles
[1:44:50] you to the

[1:45:11] everything all the Splendor of heaven
[1:45:14] and he came down for you and I to save
[1:45:17] us do you know what that is he left
[1:45:20] everything he took on the form of
[1:45:23] man now we could have gone on and maybe
[1:45:25] you can go and study this that the Bible
[1:45:27] says that he learned obedience through
[1:45:31] suffering the Bible says he was tempted
[1:45:33] on All Points you say on All Points yes
[1:45:37] he had to be tested on All Points so
[1:45:39] that you can know what you are going
[1:45:40] through and because he overcame you
[1:45:43] overcame I don't know if you heard what
[1:45:44] I said because he overcame you're not
[1:45:47] you're going to overcome because he
[1:45:49] overcame it you
[1:45:51] have overcome because you overcame
[1:45:53] Temptation you have already overcome
[1:45:55] Temptation you see it's not based on our
[1:45:57] works it's based on what Christ has done
[1:45:59] for
[1:46:03] us so ask yourself do you think Christ
[1:46:06] was tempted with woman as a young man
[1:46:10] yes every point he was tested
[1:46:15] on you would have been tested on alcohol
[1:46:18] you would have been tested on the things
[1:46:19] of that was in in the world at that time
[1:46:22] the devil came there in the to tempt him
[1:46:24] with the riches of the world with money
[1:46:26] finances kingdoms of the world he was
[1:46:28] tempted on All Points yes yet he was
[1:46:31] found obedient to the will of the father
[1:46:33] in every one of
[1:46:35] them all he's asking for you to is to
[1:46:37] have faith in him believe his word and
[1:46:40] Obey him surrender die to
[1:46:43] self I if you are willing to have a
[1:46:45] burial service and say I'm willing to
[1:46:47] die to self amen
[1:46:50] kill the flesh man and let there be a
[1:46:53] resurrection of the spirit man amen
[1:46:55] glory be to his name amen praise the
[1:46:58] lordu thank you
[1:47:00] Jesus amen isn't he worthy of Praise
[1:47:03] he's worthy of glory amen Let's Just
[1:47:06] Surrender to him amen let's just lay
[1:47:08] aside everything and say Lord I want to
[1:47:10] let go of everything maybe unknowingly I
[1:47:12] was caught up in these things I was
[1:47:14] caught up in idolatry and Pagan
[1:47:19] worship amen I don't want to be caught
[1:47:22] up in those things anymore God is a
[1:47:24] spirit and they that worship Him must
