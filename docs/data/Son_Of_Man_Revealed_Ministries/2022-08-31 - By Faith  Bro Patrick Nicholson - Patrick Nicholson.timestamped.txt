[24:15] and i believe that
[24:16] we know that your words will still
[24:19] remain after millions of years it will
[24:21] be the same
[24:23] it was millions of years the same before
[24:25] it even came in the pages of the bible
[24:28] and we know that we have to stay within
[24:31] the pages of the bible from genesis to
[24:33] revelation because whoever takes away or
[24:37] adds there's a curse on that person amen
[24:39] that's why we want to pray that you
[24:41] bless us lord as we keep to your word in
[24:43] the name of jesus christ bless the
[24:45] pastor of this church of god bless
[24:47] everyone
[24:48] that's
[24:49] that he leads bless everyone of god that
[24:52] has been ordained to support him yes in
[24:55] the name of jesus christ we pray a
[24:57] blessing father bless everything that
[24:59] will be done from here on in jesus
[25:01] christ
[25:03] amen
[25:05] in the book of james chapter
[25:09] 2 and verse 21
[25:22] my brethren have not the faith of our
[25:24] lord jesus christ the lord of glory
[25:27] with respect of persons
[25:30] for if they come unto your assembly or
[25:32] your assembly a man with a gold ring in
[25:34] goodly apparel and they come in also a
[25:37] man in vile raymond
[25:39] and you have respect to him of the gay
[25:41] clothing and saying to him
[25:44] here in a good place and
[25:46] say to the poor stand out there or sit
[25:49] here under my footstool
[25:52] are you not then partial in yourselves
[25:54] and i'll become judges of evil thoughts
[25:57] how can my beloved brethren
[26:02] have not god chosen the poor of this
[26:04] world which in faith
[26:06] is a kingdom which he had promised to
[26:09] them that love him
[26:11] but he have despised the poor
[26:13] do not reach men oppress you and draw
[26:15] you before the judgment says do not they
[26:17] blaspheme the worthy name by which you
[26:19] have called yeah fulfill the royal law
[26:22] according to the scripture
[26:24] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[26:27] you well amen but if you respect
[26:30] but if you have respect to persons you
[26:32] commit sin and are convinced of the law
[26:34] as transgressors amen for whosoever
[26:37] shall keep the whole law and yet to
[26:38] offend in one point he is guilty yes
[26:41] amen for he that said do not commit a
[26:43] doubt he said also do not kill
[26:46] now if you committed if thou commit no
[26:48] adultery yet you without kill now thou
[26:51] become a transgressor of the law so
[26:53] speak he and so do
[26:55] and say that shall be judged by the law
[26:57] of liberty
[26:58] for he shall have judgment without mercy
[27:01] that has shown no mercy and mercy
[27:03] rejoices against judgment
[27:06] amen
[27:07] so
[27:08] [Music]
[27:09] may the lord bless the reading of his
[27:11] works
[27:12] obviously
[27:14] and i'd like to go to verse 20
[27:17] also
[27:19] and
[27:20] read that portion of scripture
[27:23] but walt down know o vain man that
[27:26] faith without works is dead amen
[27:37] well it's
[27:39] my title
[27:42] i would like to stay by
[27:47] it's a simple title amen
[27:50] nothing new
[27:52] and
[27:53] as you can see the scriptures that we
[27:55] read
[27:56] it points to that one thing that we want
[27:58] to speak
[28:00] on
[28:02] by faith amen hallelujah
[28:05] so
[28:08] we we know that
[28:13] there's a difference between
[28:15] religion
[28:16] yes and
[28:18] how many amen a lot of people will say
[28:21] that
[28:22] my my faith
[28:24] is catholic
[28:27] and then
[28:28] for my faith is message
[28:31] but that's just a religion yes that we
[28:33] are talking about
[28:35] but faith
[28:36] amen
[28:38] um
[28:39] works amen your work's cruel who you are
[28:43] and where you come from or where you're
[28:45] going
[28:46] because what
[28:47] action you have
[28:49] has got a
[28:51] um
[28:52] absolute
[28:54] move a man you are moving towards where
[28:57] your works are so amen if if orange tree
[29:01] puts out
[29:03] apples
[29:04] there's something wrong
[29:06] and yeah
[29:08] orange trees actually a hypocrite
[29:11] because it's supposed to put up oranges
[29:14] so the same way with a christian when
[29:17] he puts out different fruits and what a
[29:20] christian should put out
[29:22] he doesn't have faith according to the
[29:25] bible amen it's only he's only got a
[29:27] religion so
[29:29] um we can even read in the bible if a
[29:32] man among you seem to be religious and
[29:34] bridal is not his top
[29:36] amen
[29:37] that
[29:39] um he said
[29:41] he deceives his own heart and his
[29:43] religion
[29:45] amen so
[29:46] pure religion and undefiled before god
[29:49] the father is this to visit the
[29:51] fatherless and widows in their
[29:53] affliction yes and to keep himself
[29:56] unspotted from amen
[29:58] amen and then we have
[30:00] by faith in chapter 2 hallelujah amen so
[30:04] we thank the lord for
[30:06] giving us the faith that was once
[30:09] delivered yes amen amen hallelujah so
[30:12] it's important to know what kind of a
[30:14] faith you have yes because
[30:17] um we look at the faith in the bible
[30:21] where by faith evil by faith
[30:24] by faith
[30:26] sarah or abraham
[30:28] and all those
[30:30] [Music]
[30:31] people of
[30:33] what we would call great faith
[30:35] but
[30:36] faith
[30:38] is the substance of things
[30:40] hopeful yes and it's evidence of things
[30:44] not seen so so faith
[30:47] moves in the unseen reality yes and we
[30:51] have to understand that it's not natural
[30:55] it's it's it's something that is
[30:58] tangible yet you can't touch it with the
[31:00] five senses amen and that's why we find
[31:04] that the prophet has
[31:05] got or he rather added
[31:08] another sense
[31:10] that
[31:11] cannot be handled as
[31:14] you know
[31:15] shaking the hands of the past and
[31:17] thinking that you've got yeah
[31:18] amen amen and you find that many times
[31:21] you think uh you know your faith
[31:24] is because of you've done some
[31:27] some
[31:28] thing
[31:29] to be a i
[31:31] pleaser
[31:32] you do i service yes everything you do
[31:36] somebody must see me do it yes and then
[31:39] i know i'm kind of the person
[31:42] that is looked up to
[31:44] and that's why you get
[31:46] you get rich in those kind of the things
[31:48] where people
[31:50] oh pet you on the back and the moment
[31:52] you find that
[31:53] uh you are
[31:55] wanted you are known you are that kind
[31:58] of a person that oh yes
[32:01] i've got the front seat i've got the
[32:03] middle seat of i've got the seat where
[32:06] everybody knows that's my seating man
[32:09] now your number is not on any seat in
[32:11] this church
[32:21] faith beyond church going to church
[32:24] shaking the pastor's hand or being nice
[32:26] to the deacon when he knocks on your
[32:28] door and give him a cup of tea and
[32:30] saying goodbye and then you find
[32:32] yourself in a position where
[32:35] you don't have the faith that god is
[32:37] looking for so
[32:38] we
[32:41] find this kind of a faith
[32:43] or if we can put it that way the lack of
[32:46] this kind of a faith
[32:48] in the book of kings chapter 1
[32:51] and i'm going to read it quickly
[32:55] and the bible says
[32:58] uh
[32:59] i'd like to maybe take it from verse 17.
[33:04] if i can find it
[33:13] let me just get it right here one thing
[33:16] i want to take it further down
[33:22] even if even as i swear unto thee that's
[33:26] now 1 kings 1 and
[33:30] verse 30.
[33:31] even as i swear unto thee by the lord
[33:33] god of israel saying
[33:36] assuredly solomon thy son shall reign
[33:38] after me and he shall sit upon my throne
[33:40] in my stead even so will i certainly do
[33:43] this day
[33:44] then bathsheba bowed a face to the earth
[33:47] and the reverence of the king and said
[33:48] let my lord king david live forever as
[33:51] king david said
[33:53] call
[33:53] me zarak the priest and nathan the
[33:56] prophet and benight
[33:57] the naya the son of jehohada and they
[34:01] came before the king the king also said
[34:03] unto them take with you the servants of
[34:06] the lord and call solomon my son to ride
[34:08] upon my own mule and bring him down to
[34:11] gion
[34:12] and let zara the priest and nathan the
[34:15] prophet anointing their king over israel
[34:18] and blow ye that with the trumpet and
[34:20] say god save king solomon amen
[34:24] now
[34:25] here was
[34:29] a thing that was happening in the
[34:31] kingdom of
[34:32] where david was king
[34:34] and bathsheba realized that
[34:37] before
[34:38] somebody else
[34:39] becomes king there was a promise made to
[34:41] solomon
[34:43] now
[34:45] solomon being the king that was
[34:50] said by god that he was going to have
[34:52] david was going to have his son to reign
[34:56] we find that
[34:59] here comes another person to try to
[35:02] usurp the authority to become king
[35:05] now let's look at this
[35:08] and and look who this king
[35:10] really was
[35:14] gerald bower
[35:16] the son of nabette
[35:18] and ifr
[35:19] the first king of the 10 tribes over
[35:21] whom he reigned 22 years
[35:24] and he was the son of the video of
[35:26] zoretta and while yet so young was
[35:28] promoted by solomon to be chief
[35:30] superintendent of the
[35:33] burden that is of the bans forced by
[35:36] laborers influenced by the words of the
[35:38] prophet ahijah he began to form
[35:40] conspiracies with the view of becoming
[35:43] king of the ten tribes by these these
[35:45] having been discovered he fled to egypt
[35:48] where he remained for a length of time
[35:51] now look at this
[35:54] jeroboam the son of the successor of joe
[35:57] and the 14th king of israel over which
[35:59] he ruled for 41 years
[36:02] he followed the example of the first
[36:04] jeroboam in keeping up the worship of
[36:06] golden cows
[36:08] his reign was contemporary with those
[36:11] a messiah
[36:13] second kings and uzziah kings of judah
[36:15] he was victorious over the syrians
[36:18] extended israel to its former limits
[36:21] from the entering of hamas to the sea of
[36:23] the plain
[36:24] his reign of 41 years was the most
[36:28] prosperous that israel had ever known as
[36:30] yet with all this outward prosperity
[36:35] so we have to find ourselves in a
[36:37] situation where
[36:39] when god says the king
[36:42] reigns that's the king that reigns you
[36:44] can't
[36:45] place another king
[36:47] in his state amen and
[36:50] now we realize that when those kings had
[36:54] the issue
[36:57] there was no faith involved because it
[36:59] was all about
[37:01] who sits
[37:02] where
[37:04] amen
[37:05] and we find jeroboam
[37:08] being a reign of 41 years was the most
[37:11] prosperous
[37:12] and
[37:15] it was
[37:17] it was such a terrible time that they
[37:20] built
[37:21] carves
[37:22] golden calves to worship
[37:25] just imagine
[37:27] golden cows instead of god being
[37:29] worshiped
[37:31] so what kind of a faith do we have yes
[37:34] amen
[37:35] a monument faith that
[37:37] there was no movement of god amongst him
[37:42] but by faith
[37:44] we have to move
[37:46] where god says move amen hallelujah we
[37:50] have to take god at his word regardless
[37:53] yes of what man says
[37:55] regardless of who wants to be the next
[37:58] king
[37:59] regardless of who says
[38:01] i am the best man among you it takes god
[38:04] to come down to the point where he says
[38:08] i am the king
[38:09] amen god becomes
[38:12] king in that man now let's go to the
[38:15] quotations and find what faith does
[38:22] what does faith really do
[38:28] was not abram or father justified by
[38:31] works when he had offered isaac his son
[38:33] upon the altar
[38:35] see is how faith with his works and by
[38:38] works was faith made perfect and the
[38:41] scripture was fulfilled saying
[38:43] abram believed god and it was imputed
[38:46] unto him for righteousness and he was
[38:48] called the friend of god amen hallelujah
[38:52] you see then how that by works a man is
[38:55] justified and not by faith only yes
[38:58] likewise rehab the heart justified by
[39:01] works when she received the messengers
[39:04] and sent them out another way
[39:07] for as the body without the spirit is
[39:09] dead so faith without works is dead also
[39:14] see it looks like paul was speaking in
[39:17] romans the fourth chapter justifying
[39:20] abraham by faith
[39:22] and james is justifying him by words
[39:25] yeah
[39:27] but it does not contradict because paul
[39:30] was speaking of what god saw in abraham
[39:34] james was speaking what man saw in
[39:37] abraham
[39:38] [Music]
[39:40] paul was speaking of what god
[39:42] saw in abraham in genesis 6 we when he
[39:45] told him that he was going to have the
[39:47] child by sarah or paul and abram
[39:50] believed god and it was impute imputed
[39:52] him
[39:53] unto him for righteousness he believed
[39:56] the promise
[39:57] that's what god saw
[40:01] when james spoke he was speaking of what
[40:04] man saw in genesis 22 where abram
[40:06] offered up isaac
[40:08] because that's the works amen he was
[40:10] going to kill isaac amen on the altar
[40:14] see
[40:15] what faith you have that's what god sees
[40:18] amen amen
[40:20] amen amen but what your words is that's
[40:24] what your neighbor said amen
[40:28] amen
[40:29] oh yes amen
[40:32] show me your works by your faith
[40:35] without your faith and i'll show you
[40:38] my words by my faith see
[40:41] so
[40:42] that
[40:43] this audience here has faith i believe
[40:46] that but i believe you're afraid to turn
[40:48] it loose
[40:54] i believe that if you would just let
[40:56] your faith amen amen yes it's like that
[41:00] horse wild horse
[41:02] while it's tired it's just trying to
[41:04] pull loose
[41:06] amen but
[41:08] as long as that rope is
[41:10] on its neck
[41:11] it can go nowhere yes but let it go
[41:14] loose it will just keep on running amen
[41:17] hallelujah man so you see
[41:20] you have to have works
[41:23] you have to push on
[41:25] that faith that's on the inside of you
[41:27] if you don't push it out it's just going
[41:29] to lay dormant yes remember what we said
[41:33] that faith is a seed
[41:36] and as long as you are keeping it in
[41:40] your hand
[41:42] you have to let it go you have to sew it
[41:46] you have to release it and once it's
[41:48] released it falls into ground yeah
[41:51] it falls into good ground it falls on
[41:53] phony the thornies and it falls on
[41:56] stones
[41:57] and it falls a man
[41:59] where
[42:00] it can be chopped out it can be picked
[42:03] up
[42:04] but when it falls on good ground
[42:06] it brings forth
[42:08] in abundance yes that's why jesus said
[42:12] unless or except a corn of wheat fall
[42:15] into the ground and
[42:17] die it abides alone so you see
[42:20] once
[42:21] that faith falls into the ground when it
[42:24] dies then
[42:26] you
[42:26] you you are not patted on the back
[42:30] like
[42:31] you know when you came into the message
[42:33] everybody liked you
[42:35] hallelujah
[42:36] everybody wanted to be in your company
[42:40] but then
[42:41] it was like jesus
[42:43] when he said except you eat
[42:45] the flesh
[42:47] and drink the blood
[42:49] of the son of man you have no part in me
[42:52] and they say well this man is a vampire
[42:55] 17 that joined him left him went back to
[42:58] caiaphas
[42:59] [Music]
[43:00] priestly man
[43:02] so you find yourself in that situation
[43:05] where
[43:06] when you long in the message then you
[43:09] start to learn now if you're not
[43:11] learning the message then you are
[43:13] becoming stagnant so once you start
[43:15] learning you find that you are getting
[43:18] revelation upon revelations
[43:21] so you're adding to your faith amen and
[43:24] once you add to your faith you find
[43:26] yourself
[43:27] something new it comes your way things
[43:30] that you've never seen before god
[43:33] reveals to you at that time amen when
[43:36] you are ready amen you can't give a baby
[43:41] a steak yeah
[43:42] from land or chicken from nando's you
[43:46] have to give that baby
[43:48] its food in due season amen otherwise it
[43:52] kills them
[43:54] amen and that's why when you are born
[43:56] again now people think that when you're
[43:59] born again
[44:00] oh yes you have a beginning of the new
[44:04] birth
[44:05] and there is an acceptance of your faith
[44:08] and that is the full birth when the baby
[44:11] cries out
[44:12] hallelujah amen amen every year baby
[44:15] cried hallelujah
[44:17] [Music]
[44:18] we are talking about spiritual babies
[44:20] amen christ yes
[44:22] there's something about you that
[44:24] you know you're not still born yes
[44:28] you cry out now
[44:30] we don't want you to maybe cry out in
[44:32] church
[44:33] but when you cry out in prayer when you
[44:36] crowd before god and your wife hears you
[44:39] and says what's happening
[44:41] to jeremiah in the in the room back
[44:43] there
[44:44] there's something strange
[44:46] but there was something that struck
[44:48] jeremiah at that point
[44:51] something that he never saw
[44:54] when he came into the message amen yes
[44:57] and then
[44:58] he cries out a hallelujah so much so
[45:02] it's because his faith is broken amen
[45:05] he's getting
[45:07] revelation upon
[45:09] revelation
[45:10] because without revelation and the bible
[45:13] says or i think the prophet did say this
[45:16] he said
[45:17] faith
[45:18] is a revelation amen
[45:20] anybody believe that amen faith is a
[45:23] revelation
[45:24] so
[45:25] when abel received a revelation that was
[45:28] faith he had faith and remember if you
[45:31] don't have faith
[45:33] god is not pleased
[45:35] with your lack of faith yes
[45:38] can you say now how do i get faith amen
[45:42] remember
[45:43] you don't have to work for faith it's a
[45:46] free gift god gives it to you yes amen
[45:49] he says
[45:50] yes faith add to your faith now
[45:52] is the seed and amen or rather let it
[45:56] die
[45:57] [Music]
[45:58] amen
[46:00] once that faith dies it brings out life
[46:04] yes and the life starts to mature amen
[46:07] and starts to build the bone
[46:11] so once you are adding to your faith
[46:13] remember
[46:14] [Music]
[46:16] you can still just be a baby
[46:18] a man just pushing out there's no
[46:21] spirit in you yet
[46:23] because remember
[46:25] we have to be accepted by god god
[46:28] accepts your faith yes once god accepts
[46:31] your faith
[46:32] he seals it away yes heals your faith
[46:35] now just imagine cook
[46:39] coke has to
[46:40] find a bottle
[46:44] and that bottle might be in the mud
[46:47] amen now look at yourself
[46:49] once that bottle is found
[46:54] the coke looks at that bottle and says
[46:57] this is coke
[47:00] it belongs to coke
[47:03] the name written down is
[47:05] this is coca-cola company yes written on
[47:09] the bottle
[47:11] skulk's bottle but now it's full thing
[47:14] it's found in the mud now look at you as
[47:17] that sinner amen saved by grace amen you
[47:21] are you were a son of god but you are
[47:24] dirty
[47:26] you are muddy
[47:27] you are unsanctified
[47:31] but you are justified yes
[47:34] hallelujah that's why we find ourselves
[47:38] as a son of god you are justified
[47:42] and
[47:43] justified by faith amen
[47:47] nothing else amen you're not justified
[47:49] by a church you belong to yes you're not
[47:52] justified because you read the bible
[47:54] every night you're not justified because
[47:57] you fast you're justified because god
[48:01] gave you
[48:02] life
[48:03] amen
[48:04] but that life can be laying under the
[48:06] ground
[48:07] to see
[48:08] it's the sun
[48:10] and that's why
[48:12] church ages in the book of church ages
[48:15] has said that a son
[48:17] can go a long way before it recognizes
[48:20] that it's just not yes amen hallelujah
[48:23] it's way back yeah
[48:25] but you're a son yes you you are
[48:28] justified before you know you are
[48:30] justified
[48:32] amen because god can't lose you amen he
[48:37] knew you before the world ever
[48:40] amen to uh be a molecule before there
[48:44] was a molecule you was there
[48:52] so now he justifies you
[48:55] he brings you up now he has to sanctify
[48:58] yes he has to clean you up so it's all a
[49:01] work of faith it's by faith amen by
[49:05] faith you are justified by faith you are
[49:07] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[49:09] christ by faith you are sanctified yes
[49:13] amen add to your faith let your
[49:15] knowledge can prince patience god and
[49:17] his brother be kindness
[49:19] so forth and then when god sees that
[49:22] adding
[49:23] you
[49:24] you're adding amen
[49:27] he gives you now paul speaks about faith
[49:30] to faith
[49:32] amen
[49:33] how does that work
[49:36] let's look at the musician for a while
[49:38] the musician has got no remy foster
[49:41] lucky
[49:43] amen so why to those
[49:46] why faith to faith
[49:49] amen
[49:51] why
[49:52] from light which is infrared
[49:55] to ultraviolet still light
[49:58] so when you look through the rainbow you
[50:00] find that
[50:02] ultraviolet
[50:03] cannot be seen by the eye
[50:06] neither can infrared because it's beyond
[50:08] the spectrum
[50:10] of vision
[50:12] hallelujah
[50:15] so now we have to find why faith to
[50:18] faith when paul speaks about faith to
[50:19] faith
[50:21] because it's the same
[50:24] gift
[50:25] that has been glorified amen the same
[50:29] gift because it's not a different faith
[50:32] when you get to the top of the pyramid
[50:34] it's the same thing
[50:36] it's just worked out amen and it's it's
[50:39] so much work to the extent that god
[50:42] accepts it amen but it's now fruit he's
[50:44] his fruit he came to the fig tree
[50:48] and he was expecting to find
[50:50] fruit
[50:51] a man thing
[50:53] because it was a fig leaf it had leaves
[50:56] and before you know when the leaf is
[50:58] there the fruit should be there
[51:00] otherwise
[51:01] it's a hypocritical tree
[51:04] it's clapping its hands
[51:06] in the wind the leaves are lit
[51:09] hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord
[51:13] but there's no fruit yeah hallelujah how
[51:16] do you know that a man claps his hands
[51:18] and there's no fruit he doesn't read his
[51:20] bible he doesn't pray he doesn't give
[51:23] god thanks and he doesn't testify amen
[51:27] about the goodness of god
[51:30] and that's where we have to find
[51:32] ourselves friends amen if you're sick
[51:34] you must testify amen amen
[51:37] that is by faith yes amen yes hallelujah
[51:41] if you're a christian you must tell your
[51:43] boss amen
[51:46] by faith hallelujah
[51:49] if your wife is not saved tell her
[51:52] honey
[51:53] i'm a christian
[51:55] that's by faith my faith alone
[51:58] so
[52:00] you have taken or you've been given
[52:03] faith god gives you the faith
[52:05] you don't get it from the past you don't
[52:07] get it from the church you don't get it
[52:09] from the tapes and the books
[52:12] of william branham
[52:13] you get it
[52:14] from god it's a gift amen hallelujah if
[52:18] i give you this time
[52:20] amen it belongs to
[52:22] it no more belongs to me it's yours
[52:26] hallelujah and when i give the style to
[52:28] you
[52:30] and
[52:32] many witnesses in a court of law
[52:36] will be witnesses against me
[52:39] that i want to take this night back
[52:42] amen and that's why
[52:44] god says add to your faith
[52:47] amen
[52:49] yes amen because it's your faith now
[52:52] but he gave it to you
[52:54] and when he gives you it's like the man
[52:57] that was given
[52:58] five and
[52:59] one and
[53:01] uh ten
[53:02] and the ten made ten the five made five
[53:04] and the one made one
[53:06] amen or whatever or the one didn't make
[53:08] anything
[53:10] he just give gave back to one
[53:12] so that's what when you when you're
[53:15] given faith you have to
[53:17] you have to
[53:18] put it where
[53:19] uh
[53:20] the man said
[53:22] why didn't you put it in the usually
[53:24] where i can gather interest amen
[53:27] rather than bury it
[53:29] very far away and that's we are not
[53:32] talking about bearing in the in the
[53:34] ground
[53:35] of of
[53:36] of the word of god
[53:38] we are talking about you are hiding who
[53:41] you are yes amen amen
[53:44] you are not telling the devil who you
[53:47] are amen
[53:48] yes and as long as you are not telling
[53:51] the devil who you are there is no growth
[53:55] yes
[53:56] absolutely no growth
[53:58] because your growth comes when you make
[54:01] the devil
[54:03] ashamed of you amen amen
[54:06] tell the devil and say satan i'm the son
[54:09] of god hallelujah amen
[54:11] you know what
[54:12] all of a sudden yeah
[54:14] satan thought you behind him but when he
[54:17] opens his eyes you are facing him yes
[54:20] hallelujah toe to toe hand your hands
[54:26] you are holding him right there hear
[54:29] what he says but who are you you i
[54:31] thought you behind me
[54:32] amen you know when you lie you're behind
[54:35] the devil
[54:37] you're not in front of him amen he's
[54:39] he's always
[54:40] ahead of you
[54:42] he lied before you ever once or started
[54:44] your life
[54:46] amen
[54:47] so you have to realize that when you
[54:50] face the devil the prophet would make
[54:53] the statement and he says
[54:56] all
[54:57] hell's guns are trained on the team
[55:01] amen no you wouldn't want that would you
[55:04] hey man
[55:05] you you don't you're a peaceful guy you
[55:08] you don't want to have no wall
[55:10] but when you say i'm a son of god
[55:13] satan
[55:15] points
[55:16] every atomic energy that he's got at you
[55:19] amen amen so when you walk remember all
[55:23] hell is firing at you amen amen because
[55:27] now you are walking by faith
[55:29] [Music]
[55:30] hallelujah amen so now you have to
[55:33] recognize that matters not what you do
[55:37] your boss is against you your wife is
[55:40] against you your husband is against you
[55:43] everything is against you because of
[55:46] what you just uttered
[55:49] by your lips
[55:51] i'm a son of god
[55:53] hallelujah
[55:55] and when you when when the devil
[55:57] recognizes
[55:59] by what you say
[56:02] amen
[56:04] you are
[56:05] trampling the moment you wake up
[56:08] the moment you place your feet on
[56:11] the ground
[56:13] hallelujah or your knees
[56:16] satan is trembling
[56:19] amen one word that you speak in the name
[56:21] of the lord jesus christ
[56:23] when you pray in the morning it's by
[56:26] faith amen
[56:27] because you don't see god god is nowhere
[56:31] to be sin he's not in the bathroom he's
[56:34] not in the lounge he's not in the
[56:36] bedroom but he's somewhere by faith
[56:40] hallelujah
[56:41] thank you and you have to find him at
[56:44] that moment you have to recognize that
[56:47] if you don't find god now satan has got
[56:51] his eyes on you
[56:53] he's focused only on you amen so you
[56:57] have to know where you stand
[56:59] hallelujah when you stand amen
[57:03] don't mess around with the devil sister
[57:06] brother
[57:08] he's got you covered amen how many times
[57:21] so now when you throw that feed into the
[57:23] ground
[57:24] amen it's either
[57:28] you are storing it
[57:30] and just leaving it because you are not
[57:31] going to make it multiply
[57:33] [Music]
[57:34] or you are
[57:36] throwing it into good ground yes yes
[57:38] away from the thorns
[57:40] away from the stones
[57:42] away from the birds
[57:45] and you are
[57:48] allowing it
[57:49] to grow watering dying
[57:52] doing all kinds of things
[57:54] so that you know
[57:56] your life success
[57:58] in the growth of that seed
[58:01] not just putting it there
[58:03] forgetting about it you have to
[58:05] nurture that series but don't dig it up
[58:10] let it grow
[58:12] hallelujah
[58:14] and say oh you know
[58:17] the seed that i planted in the ground
[58:21] nothing's happening to it yet push it
[58:23] back
[58:24] next day up again no nothing yet put it
[58:27] down nothing yet you know you won't have
[58:30] a crop like that yes it's not possible
[58:33] because you have to let the laws of god
[58:36] work amen
[58:37] hallelujah so
[58:39] if
[58:40] god says anything in his word
[58:43] you have to
[58:45] take it yes
[58:47] by faith amen yes amen
[58:51] and once you take it by faith
[58:53] all you have to do is walk you want to
[58:56] retain man
[58:57] don't worry about anything else
[58:58] about
[58:59] i'm gonna dissect this and see how this
[59:01] is gonna work hallelujah you know i
[59:04] prayed for my baby and nothing's
[59:06] happening
[59:07] it's just the same
[59:10] you have to have patience yes god
[59:12] demands patience amen
[59:14] and when you have that kind of a
[59:15] patience a man you find that like the
[59:17] farmer he plants an onion and it's just
[59:22] it's just one onion but from that onion
[59:24] when he waits about 19 90
[59:27] or nine months nine months
[59:30] he has to wait for harvest
[59:34] i mean
[59:35] patience
[59:37] he waits for that
[59:38] and when he sees the fruit of his labors
[59:42] amen just by waiting
[59:45] what do you do amen when when uh the job
[59:49] that you prayed for doesn't happen
[59:52] oh you know
[59:54] i don't know what to do now what must i
[59:57] do because pray it was the only thing
[1:00:00] i'm told that would work
[1:00:02] but now i prayed and nothing happened
[1:00:05] now what to do now
[1:00:09] oh just apply again apply again and
[1:00:12] apply again amen and you know nothing
[1:00:15] nothing
[1:00:16] you just have to constantly
[1:00:19] by faith
[1:00:20] tell god
[1:00:22] i believe amen amen oh man that's
[1:00:25] watering now
[1:00:27] you're watching the series i believe
[1:00:29] lord amen
[1:00:31] though nothing happened yet yes
[1:00:34] like when you're let's say you have tb
[1:00:37] or you have cancer you find yourself in
[1:00:40] that the doctor said you've got cancer
[1:00:44] so what's happening now is the doctor is
[1:00:47] sowing scenes
[1:00:48] of discrepancy in jersey
[1:00:51] amen not that
[1:00:53] not that he
[1:00:55] doesn't like you
[1:00:56] because as long as you're coming
[1:00:59] you are going to give him something you
[1:01:01] are sowing
[1:01:02] a man
[1:01:04] without realizing you are sowing
[1:01:07] seeds
[1:01:08] into his bank account
[1:01:11] amen
[1:01:13] you are you are you are
[1:01:15] adding
[1:01:16] to his balance
[1:01:19] instead of adding to your faith amen
[1:01:23] hallelujah
[1:01:25] no i'm not saying don't go to the doctor
[1:01:28] hallelujah but i'm saying that
[1:01:32] add to your faith
[1:01:34] that god has done the work in your life
[1:01:38] amen amen
[1:01:39] nothing should be able to stop you from
[1:01:41] believing that
[1:01:43] that by faith you are going to receive
[1:01:45] what you ask for yes amen now the bible
[1:01:48] does say that if you ask you shall
[1:01:51] receive yes amen now it's as simple as
[1:01:53] that if you ask you receive amen so now
[1:01:57] how many times have you not received the
[1:01:59] bible said because you asked us yes you
[1:02:02] asked wrong amen now the round asking is
[1:02:07] when you want to
[1:02:10] place whatever you have asked for just
[1:02:13] for yourself
[1:02:15] you know i'm just
[1:02:17] i'm just gonna show
[1:02:18] them
[1:02:20] that
[1:02:22] what kind of a faith i have
[1:02:24] and i'm going to come here and
[1:02:27] just
[1:02:28] do what i have to do
[1:02:30] the best
[1:02:31] you know look at this we've got the best
[1:02:33] guitar
[1:02:35] human names or whatever they call it
[1:02:38] am i right amen is that the right word
[1:02:42] it's a smart guitar it's expensive
[1:02:48] you see
[1:02:49] when you ask materially
[1:02:52] god will give to you if you ask by faith
[1:02:56] but now sometimes you don't get
[1:02:59] what you have asked for is because you
[1:03:00] want to spend it on your
[1:03:03] you know
[1:03:05] your flesh amen and then when you don't
[1:03:08] receive it you say
[1:03:09] faith doesn't work
[1:03:12] faith works all the time amen faith
[1:03:16] doesn't have a flat factory amen faith
[1:03:19] has got a key
[1:03:21] amen faith has got the mechanics yes
[1:03:24] faith has got the dynamics amen every
[1:03:28] time you turn the key it stops amen all
[1:03:31] you have to do is put it in again there
[1:03:33] you go that's faith remember this and
[1:03:36] even if you
[1:03:38] forget everything that i've said here
[1:03:39] tonight remember this one thing that
[1:03:42] faith
[1:03:43] will never
[1:03:45] leave you
[1:03:46] in the lodge amen
[1:03:49] hallelujah united will always take you
[1:03:51] where you want to go amen
[1:03:53] remember that amen
[1:03:55] where you want to go faith will take you
[1:03:58] just go to the right place
[1:04:00] hallelujah amen
[1:04:02] by faith
[1:04:03] everything
[1:04:04] will work for you amen because remember
[1:04:09] we need
[1:04:11] what kind of a faith do we need
[1:04:13] to get out of this body
[1:04:15] rapturing faith yes
[1:04:18] rapturing faith
[1:04:19] so what is rapturing faith
[1:04:22] the prophet says
[1:04:24] it's based on divine healing
[1:04:27] yes
[1:04:28] so now
[1:04:30] you had a sickness and
[1:04:32] you
[1:04:33] maybe flew
[1:04:35] and the fuel flew away
[1:04:37] it's gone it's gone
[1:04:39] so you were once sick now you are
[1:04:40] healthy
[1:04:42] what happened the body has got a
[1:04:44] resistance
[1:04:46] amen that you don't even have to believe
[1:04:49] and then
[1:04:50] the body itself is
[1:04:53] a healer because it comes from god god
[1:04:55] amen god designed this body to do and
[1:04:58] fight if you must know what fight this
[1:05:01] body has right now on the inside of you
[1:05:04] every blood cell every black capacitor
[1:05:07] every red blood cell is fighting for
[1:05:10] your life
[1:05:12] fighting against viruses fighting
[1:05:14] against gems fighting against every
[1:05:17] onslaught that the enemy has to show you
[1:05:20] what happens amen the blood takes it
[1:05:23] away yeah hallelujah and that's that's
[1:05:26] easy when you are in christ the blood
[1:05:28] takes away
[1:05:29] every onslaught of the enemy
[1:05:32] you don't even have to do anything all
[1:05:33] you have to do is walk by faith amen
[1:05:37] oh i like that amen
[1:05:40] walk by faith
[1:05:42] so now
[1:05:45] divine healing and rapturing faith is
[1:05:48] the same thing amen because rapturing
[1:05:52] faith is the body change
[1:05:54] yes amen when you have a flu it's a body
[1:05:58] if you have cancer it's a body change
[1:06:02] your body changes from death to life
[1:06:05] amen hallelujah
[1:06:07] once you realize that the doctor said
[1:06:10] you see that there's a cancer
[1:06:12] working right there maybe in the lung or
[1:06:14] whatever it is
[1:06:16] and he says now uh
[1:06:18] this is growing and i can't cut it
[1:06:21] because
[1:06:22] it's going to take your life
[1:06:24] and when it's in the place maybe in the
[1:06:27] brain
[1:06:28] you can't take it out
[1:06:31] but then
[1:06:33] you start to believe
[1:06:35] and the prophet said
[1:06:37] never have a negative testimony yes
[1:06:39] regardless of the symptoms and the
[1:06:41] situation never have a negative
[1:06:44] testimony because that will bring you
[1:06:46] down
[1:06:47] and
[1:06:48] in the book of demonology we find that
[1:06:50] the prophet would
[1:06:52] come to a point where he says i'd like
[1:06:54] to teach you how to keep your healing
[1:06:58] after you've been prayed for keeping
[1:07:00] your healing amen you know that you have
[1:07:02] to fight amen every inch of the way
[1:07:06] like joshua and caleb they had to fight
[1:07:09] every inch of the way
[1:07:10] in the promised land amen so what is the
[1:07:13] promise it's the baptism of the holy
[1:07:15] ghost amen so when you are in the
[1:07:17] promise or the promises in you
[1:07:20] you have to fight every inch of the way
[1:07:22] amen fight your way to your health fight
[1:07:26] your way if your husband is wayward or
[1:07:28] your wife is wayward or your child is
[1:07:30] where you fight your way and you'll soon
[1:07:32] find them where you want them to be in
[1:07:35] christ
[1:07:36] but you say oh you know i'm the only one
[1:07:39] serving god hallelujah and i'm the only
[1:07:42] one praying in this house and i'm the
[1:07:44] only one
[1:07:49] yes be quiet
[1:07:52] quieten down
[1:07:55] and tell the lord said lord forgive me
[1:07:59] for being
[1:08:00] so negative
[1:08:03] forgive me for
[1:08:04] not having faith
[1:08:06] hallelujah like the woman washing the
[1:08:09] dishes she was washing the dishes and
[1:08:12] the man said you know
[1:08:13] to his friend at the bar
[1:08:16] he said to
[1:08:17] him i'll show you the real christian
[1:08:19] amen
[1:08:22] yes and he said you know now just
[1:08:24] imagine if she would have acted
[1:08:26] differently
[1:08:27] that night she thought well if my
[1:08:29] husband comes home tonight i'm going to
[1:08:31] show him a piece of my mind or something
[1:08:34] like that you know
[1:08:36] but she was a christian beyond
[1:08:39] anything that he would expect when he
[1:08:40] got home
[1:08:42] because he told his his friend
[1:08:45] let's go home yes and i'll show you a
[1:08:48] real christian amen there's no such a
[1:08:50] thing as a real christian
[1:08:52] amen any real christians here tonight
[1:08:54] amen amen my auntie's up amen hallelujah
[1:08:59] there's only two in you
[1:09:01] that's fine amen we need only two amen
[1:09:06] because we're two or three are gathered
[1:09:08] amen that's where faith is amen
[1:09:11] hallelujah
[1:09:14] i know you have faith but you didn't
[1:09:16] have faith to raise your hand
[1:09:19] you see it's by faith you do nothing
[1:09:21] else
[1:09:22] so she he goes home with his friend
[1:09:25] and
[1:09:26] she dishes up like she gives him egg or
[1:09:29] whatever
[1:09:30] he and the plate comes around and she
[1:09:33] goes back
[1:09:34] into the kitchen to prepare something
[1:09:36] else maybe the tea or whatever she was
[1:09:38] preparing and as she goes he throws the
[1:09:41] egg behind her against the wall and he
[1:09:44] says if this is what you're gonna give
[1:09:46] us we are not having it oh my gosh going
[1:09:49] from left to right and he's discussing
[1:09:52] and doing his own thing
[1:09:54] but she was just there saying lord if i
[1:09:56] have this alone singing a song
[1:09:59] oh my she was as sweet as ever
[1:10:02] no i don't think we have wives like that
[1:10:04] today
[1:10:08] i'm sorry
[1:10:10] but i don't think
[1:10:12] if i must throw my eggs
[1:10:21] but praise god he was a real christian
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:38] she knew
[1:10:40] what this was amen amen it was a husband
[1:10:44] but he was he was not where he was
[1:10:47] supposed to be
[1:10:49] he is not at his post of duty hallelujah
[1:10:52] and
[1:10:54] she just kept on washing him and seeing
[1:10:57] the songs
[1:10:59] picking up the broken
[1:11:02] uh plates and
[1:11:04] eggs on the floor
[1:11:08] they wept at night amen that's right
[1:11:11] they cried
[1:11:14] because
[1:11:16] of the testimony of a wife amen
[1:11:20] that was true not to a husband
[1:11:23] she was true to christ amen oh my it was
[1:11:27] in the husband's spirit she was
[1:11:29] exhibiting
[1:11:30] it was the spirit of christ amen how did
[1:11:33] she do that i think amen hallelujah she
[1:11:36] didn't have anything to touch you tell
[1:11:38] you not if i press this button my
[1:11:40] husband will smile at me or you press
[1:11:43] that button he won't throw this around
[1:11:45] and i mean he's embarrassing me in front
[1:11:48] of his friend
[1:11:51] just imagine i'm gonna get him tonight
[1:11:54] wait till he comes to bed
[1:11:57] i'll have my rolling pin
[1:12:00] ready for him
[1:12:02] just waiting for him to shut his eye i'm
[1:12:05] gonna knock the bumps out of
[1:12:09] but friends she was not listening to
[1:12:12] what the devil was saying on the one
[1:12:14] side she was listening to by faith
[1:12:20] she recognized who she was amen and she
[1:12:22] recognized the devil in her husband and
[1:12:25] the devil enough in his friend yes
[1:12:28] she knew where she stood with christ
[1:12:31] oh yes amen so it comes to that point
[1:12:34] friends
[1:12:35] where here was solomon
[1:12:38] and he
[1:12:39] because of his wives that he took
[1:12:42] he made an idol
[1:12:44] every foreign wife she brought her own
[1:12:46] idol with hallelujah before you knew it
[1:12:49] there were so many idols in israel that
[1:12:52] they didn't know which one to worship
[1:12:53] yes hallelujah let alone the very god
[1:12:56] that brought them out of egypt amen that
[1:12:59] blessed and anointed david a man after
[1:13:02] his own heart
[1:13:03] and here solomon was
[1:13:05] rearing up temples yes
[1:13:08] gods
[1:13:09] to other nations
[1:13:11] when he died jeroboam took over
[1:13:13] when jeroboam took over
[1:13:16] they came to him
[1:13:19] and they said you know uh
[1:13:23] you were serving there and being the
[1:13:25] head solomon made you head of this that
[1:13:27] and the other he said go to
[1:13:30] the new king
[1:13:31] amen
[1:13:33] go to the new king and ask him
[1:13:36] uh solomon's son
[1:13:38] forget what his name was
[1:13:40] and
[1:13:41] ask him to make our burdens later
[1:13:45] so the king went
[1:13:49] and he asked
[1:13:50] he asked the uh
[1:13:53] the eldest
[1:13:55] what must he do to these
[1:13:57] people jeroboam and these friends and he
[1:14:00] said after three days come back or
[1:14:02] whatever time it was given
[1:14:05] and they came back and they said
[1:14:07] let's say it's the king
[1:14:09] because the king didn't listen to the
[1:14:11] old man he went to the young man you
[1:14:13] asked them and they said make their
[1:14:15] burdens harder
[1:14:18] so the problem was that
[1:14:20] the faith that
[1:14:21] solomon had was now rubbing or should
[1:14:25] have rubbed off on his sons
[1:14:27] but they went the other way and they
[1:14:29] built two golden cards
[1:14:32] so that's what
[1:14:34] can happen
[1:14:36] to this great king
[1:14:38] his faith to god that he said
[1:14:41] when he prayed when
[1:14:43] your people israel is in trouble when
[1:14:46] they face
[1:14:47] a temple
[1:14:48] let them be saved
[1:14:51] let them be delivered
[1:14:55] but the golden cows were not
[1:14:57] and they were being worshiped
[1:14:59] and god
[1:15:01] sent elijah
[1:15:04] amen and we don't know who
[1:15:07] and where he comes from
[1:15:09] but elijah was a man of god
[1:15:11] amen hallelujah
[1:15:13] he wasn't to be messed around with he
[1:15:16] wasn't the one that you could play
[1:15:18] around with amen
[1:15:22] because let's just look at that
[1:15:30] he was a tishbite from kashmir in gilead
[1:15:34] as the lord god of israel lives who i
[1:15:37] serve
[1:15:39] oh my god
[1:15:40] this is faith amen it's nothing to do
[1:15:43] with you know there's my golden coffin
[1:15:46] that's the one i worship can you see
[1:15:47] that's the one that's my god no
[1:15:50] you know
[1:15:51] there's my church
[1:15:53] we in the message
[1:15:55] my past is so and so but elijah came and
[1:15:57] he said
[1:16:00] as the lord god of israel lives whom i
[1:16:03] serve there will neither be dew nor rain
[1:16:07] in the next few years except at my word
[1:16:14] who are you with the king said who are
[1:16:17] you in any case where do you come from
[1:16:21] tishberg is just a small place we don't
[1:16:23] even it's not even on my map
[1:16:26] what you doing here who are you telling
[1:16:28] me that it's not going to rain you know
[1:16:30] the seasons are regular here in israel
[1:16:33] we know
[1:16:34] no problem
[1:16:35] look how our crops are growing and it's
[1:16:37] beautiful and we
[1:16:40] have enough wheat to feed the more than
[1:16:43] anybody you know outside our country
[1:16:46] but elijah said there won't be rain yes
[1:16:51] and not even
[1:16:53] impossible do
[1:16:55] hallelujah
[1:16:56] they won't be due
[1:16:58] for three and a half years
[1:17:02] so you see
[1:17:09] it the book of kings starts with solomon
[1:17:12] and it ends with elijah
[1:17:14] oh my what did your book start with
[1:17:18] oh man
[1:17:19] where do you start in the messages oh my
[1:17:22] mother
[1:17:24] is in the message
[1:17:26] she was born in the message
[1:17:28] so now that makes me in the message no
[1:17:30] he does not make you the message you
[1:17:33] must be born again amen because it's by
[1:17:35] faith for your mother and it's by faith
[1:17:37] for you yes amen you must be born again
[1:17:40] you must have a new birth experience and
[1:17:42] once that happens then only can you say
[1:17:46] hmm it ends
[1:17:49] with that
[1:17:51] that's where my faith ends amen in the
[1:17:53] word of god
[1:17:55] it ends with apron
[1:17:57] it might have started with ronnie but it
[1:17:59] ends with agent yes it ends it might
[1:18:02] have started with john my father and my
[1:18:04] mother about seven days adventist
[1:18:06] reunion but it ends with me my faith in
[1:18:09] christ
[1:18:10] hallelujah the god whom i serve
[1:18:13] hallelujah
[1:18:15] it's not about the god that my mother
[1:18:18] served or the god that my father served
[1:18:20] it's the god that i serve amen
[1:18:23] in the bible hallelujah yes so we have
[1:18:26] to look at those things and it's your
[1:18:28] faith it's not your mother's faith
[1:18:30] oh you know like they would say
[1:18:32] methodist
[1:18:33] my mother's faith is methodist that's
[1:18:35] why i'm a methodist
[1:18:37] that's not that's a religion it's
[1:18:39] recovery amen
[1:18:41] hallelujah
[1:18:43] so our religion must be by faith amen
[1:18:45] nothing else hallelujah you have to work
[1:18:48] your own salvation out with fear
[1:18:51] and trembling
[1:18:53] you have if you're not shaking in this
[1:18:55] message you are in the wrong seat
[1:18:58] hallelujah because when god
[1:19:01] comes on the scene
[1:19:03] you must be shaking
[1:19:06] everyone's shut when god came on the
[1:19:08] scene hallelujah but we come up with our
[1:19:12] heads high we come up as if we own this
[1:19:14] church
[1:19:15] we come up here man as we as if he
[1:19:18] doesn't say what i want to hear i'm out
[1:19:22] hallelujah then be out because you are
[1:19:25] out in any place
[1:19:27] amen be you you might be in but in your
[1:19:31] heart you're out amen
[1:19:34] there's nothing
[1:19:35] that
[1:19:38] can help you
[1:19:40] if you are not by faith
[1:19:42] because god is not pleased yes with your
[1:19:45] lack of faith you have to
[1:19:47] you have to
[1:19:48] abide amen
[1:19:51] and stay in the faith
[1:19:53] because you find yourself that when
[1:19:57] when you go out of faith
[1:19:59] you go into unbelief
[1:20:01] and unbelief will bring forth sickness
[1:20:05] worry
[1:20:06] and death
[1:20:08] hallelujah
[1:20:09] say oh we all die
[1:20:12] but
[1:20:12] you can be walking and be dead
[1:20:15] because you don't have faith you know
[1:20:18] that
[1:20:19] that your faith will
[1:20:20] make you walk
[1:20:22] be dead you're a dead man walking
[1:20:25] so may god help us
[1:20:28] my brethren have not the faith of our
[1:20:31] lord jesus christ the lord of glory with
[1:20:32] respect of person
[1:20:36] so there's no respect
[1:20:37] amen
[1:20:38] to who is
[1:20:40] gay clothing
[1:20:41] now we're not talking about gay gay men
[1:20:44] we are talking about happy clothing
[1:20:49] gay clothing is something else in this
[1:20:51] world so we're not we have to like kind
[1:20:53] of
[1:20:54] look at those things
[1:20:56] um
[1:20:58] i trust that god will show us the right
[1:21:00] way
[1:21:03] people take words and they use it
[1:21:05] i came to durban
[1:21:08] the english that they used was swear
[1:21:10] words we used in pe
[1:21:14] hallelujah so we i thought really as a
[1:21:17] young young boy of 13 years old i
[1:21:19] thought well these guys are swearing in
[1:21:21] front of a
[1:21:23] youth
[1:21:24] but then i realized no it's it's a pure
[1:21:27] english word and we just use it mostly
[1:21:30] in the wrong way
[1:21:33] so you find like things in the message
[1:21:36] i always say this to understand the
[1:21:38] message you have to go with to
[1:21:40] understand the bible you have to go east
[1:21:42] yes hallelujah
[1:21:44] and uh to get the holy spirit you have
[1:21:46] to go on your knees
[1:21:49] amen it's by faith amen there's nothing
[1:21:51] else you can do about it and that's why
[1:21:54] we find ourselves in the situation of
[1:21:55] babylon because
[1:21:57] you know the prophet would tell perry
[1:21:59] green he says there'll be nine different
[1:22:01] interpretations to my message
[1:22:04] now you can imagine now when your pastor
[1:22:06] stands here and you go up there you find
[1:22:10] you will come back
[1:22:11] with contradictions to what your past is
[1:22:14] saying
[1:22:15] because of the confusion of babylon out
[1:22:17] there because every pastor wants to be
[1:22:19] on top of the other one amen
[1:22:22] one wants to be an apostle
[1:22:24] on that one and you find yourself
[1:22:26] that
[1:22:27] because
[1:22:28] i was in the message first you have to
[1:22:31] be under me
[1:22:32] and i get a doctrine that will be above
[1:22:34] you amen and find that all of a sudden
[1:22:38] uh there's a new doctrine and it will be
[1:22:40] nine different doctrines that will be
[1:22:42] against the doctrine coming from the
[1:22:44] pulpit
[1:22:46] so stay
[1:22:47] with the word amen
[1:22:49] that's all amen yes because now you hear
[1:22:52] thunders you hear
[1:22:53] uh adoption
[1:22:55] you hear seals you hear
[1:22:58] tent vision you hear all kinds of things
[1:23:01] and then you come back and you say
[1:23:03] that a thunder is nothing but the voice
[1:23:06] of god amen paul was a thunder it was
[1:23:09] the voice of god
[1:23:11] and that was the first
[1:23:13] seat that fell into the ground i want to
[1:23:16] close in five minutes have i got another
[1:23:18] five minutes
[1:23:20] amen
[1:23:22] my time i'm i'm not having my glasses on
[1:23:26] i don't have my watch
[1:23:31] where was i
[1:23:37] amen
[1:23:39] so
[1:23:41] where do you apply
[1:23:42] an individual's faith
[1:23:46] when you look at the pearl
[1:23:48] i'm closing
[1:23:50] now watch closely
[1:23:52] now the pyramid is faith right at the
[1:23:55] bottom
[1:23:56] and next to faith is paul
[1:23:58] yes but now climb the ladder a little
[1:24:01] bit further to
[1:24:03] luther
[1:24:04] and the prophet says the just shall live
[1:24:06] by faith amen
[1:24:08] so now
[1:24:09] faith and faith something's wrong
[1:24:12] amen
[1:24:13] but when you look back at the pyramid
[1:24:15] you have to take away the individual
[1:24:18] and the church ages with the messengers
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:23] so now come back to paul again you say
[1:24:26] paul
[1:24:27] is the seed
[1:24:31] original
[1:24:33] have we got that amen amen paul is the
[1:24:36] seed original amen yes he's not just
[1:24:40] free
[1:24:41] hallelujah he's the cedar original
[1:24:46] now that makes a big difference and
[1:24:48] paul only had faith
[1:24:50] because that's the first kind of a
[1:24:53] doctrine that came our way that paul at
[1:24:56] faith irena said virtue blah blah blah
[1:24:59] blah blah blah blah
[1:25:02] and william branham had brotherly
[1:25:04] kindness
[1:25:05] nonsense
[1:25:09] can i say that again
[1:25:12] if paul only had faith
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:25:15] yes he did he had faith
[1:25:17] but he had all the virtues
[1:25:19] because
[1:25:21] to get the holy ghost the poor and the
[1:25:23] holy ghost yes he did
[1:25:25] so for paul to get the holy ghost he had
[1:25:28] to have all the virtues
[1:25:30] simple
[1:25:31] because without those virtues
[1:25:34] including the holy ghost you shall never
[1:25:37] fall verse 9 in second peter one you
[1:25:40] shall never fall
[1:25:41] so whoever wants to fall
[1:25:45] payment will just be they'll have a lack
[1:25:48] of those
[1:25:49] things in second peter one
[1:25:52] up to verse
[1:25:53] it's as simple as that
[1:25:55] that's why we are falling so much
[1:25:58] because we don't have these things
[1:26:00] enough
[1:26:01] because we didn't add to our faith
[1:26:04] because we didn't go by faith
[1:26:06] we went by
[1:26:08] doctrine nine different interpretations
[1:26:12] but
[1:26:12] paul
[1:26:13] being the foundation seed
[1:26:16] or the foundation of the church amen
[1:26:21] of the gentiles
[1:26:23] let's look away from the israelites now
[1:26:26] jews we look to the gentiles where the
[1:26:28] bride starts and paul was the lion
[1:26:32] hey man anointing
[1:26:35] and then we look at the eagle anointing
[1:26:38] hallelujah which was william branham
[1:26:42] now when the lion and the eagle which
[1:26:46] was the greatest of beasts and birds yes
[1:26:50] nothing higher than an eagle and nothing
[1:26:53] higher than a lion king of the beast
[1:26:55] king of the birds
[1:26:57] those two anointings the alpha and the
[1:27:01] omega
[1:27:02] he's the beginning and the end
[1:27:05] hallelujah so the first scene has become
[1:27:09] the scene at the end
[1:27:12] no wonder they said
[1:27:15] brother brown
[1:27:16] he said we are resting on yes you preach
[1:27:20] what paul preached amen
[1:27:22] hallelujah
[1:27:23] so friends it's not another new
[1:27:27] revelation but it's the same revelation
[1:27:30] because our
[1:27:41] to be turned back somewhere amen
[1:27:44] yes so now we come to the place that
[1:27:47] what faith have we been returned to the
[1:27:50] apostolic faith amen amen the fathers
[1:27:53] amen of pentecost
[1:27:55] that or what they were the children then
[1:27:58] but now they are the fathers because we
[1:28:00] become the children amen of something
[1:28:03] that was not right we were taken from
[1:28:05] the name of the lord jesus christ so we
[1:28:08] have to come back to the faith of the
[1:28:11] amen amen
[1:28:13] so you see
[1:28:14] paul didn't only have faith
[1:28:16] that's why you can't connect paul to
[1:28:19] faith
[1:28:20] because luther had faith
[1:28:22] the just sheltered by faith
[1:28:25] so where do you run now amen because
[1:28:27] there's two faiths
[1:28:29] but paul original seed that seeded to
[1:28:31] die
[1:28:33] go through the dark ages
[1:28:35] come up
[1:28:36] as the first shoot in luther and that's
[1:28:39] where the prophet plays justification
[1:28:42] for the church
[1:28:43] not the individual no the church
[1:28:46] hallelujah the church age and when he
[1:28:48] plays justification for the church age
[1:28:51] amen come wesley sanctification
[1:28:55] for the church age
[1:28:57] and then the pentecostals had the shock
[1:29:00] oh that's where people miss it now the
[1:29:03] shock pentecost was there
[1:29:06] by faith
[1:29:08] remember they are part of the bride you
[1:29:10] can't take them away
[1:29:11] they led pentecostals yeah hallelujah
[1:29:14] made the bride for this day
[1:29:16] so you see
[1:29:17] it looked like the seed but the seed or
[1:29:20] the seed had to or be rejected by the
[1:29:23] shock and when the shock pulled away the
[1:29:25] seed was back there in a multiplied form
[1:29:29] so that speaks of the resurrection
[1:29:32] so the life that was there
[1:29:35] a man right at the beginning
[1:29:37] has gone through
[1:29:39] and has come up all the way through to
[1:29:41] this age
[1:29:43] and this age is now the enoch age
[1:29:46] by faith amen everyone is not down there
[1:29:50] but we are up all up here remember one
[1:29:53] seed goes into the ground and if it
[1:29:55] doesn't go into the ground it abides
[1:29:57] alone
[1:29:58] you see so when the team poured into the
[1:30:01] ground it died through the dark ages
[1:30:04] came up in luther came up through wesley
[1:30:07] came up to the pentecostals now it's
[1:30:10] here as living stones
[1:30:13] living seed
[1:30:14] and now the seed
[1:30:16] is being waved there was a wave sheath
[1:30:19] hallelujah
[1:30:20] and then wave chief told us there's more
[1:30:22] coming like this
[1:30:24] let's wait
[1:30:25] so that means now
[1:30:27] everyone that was there is not here
[1:30:30] hallelujah so we're just waiting for
[1:30:33] them to be materialized in front of us
[1:30:35] because we which are alive yeah
[1:30:38] shall see them
[1:30:40] amen amen we will see paul we will see
[1:30:43] william branham we will see we will see
[1:30:46] perry green we will see all those that
[1:30:48] passed on we will see
[1:30:50] everyone
[1:30:52] that we knew amen will see them because
[1:30:56] they will be changed
[1:30:58] amen
[1:30:59] from death
[1:31:01] to life
[1:31:02] again oh yes friends
[1:31:05] so
[1:31:06] paul didn't only have faith he had all
[1:31:08] the virtues he had faith he added to his
[1:31:10] faith and he had the holy spirit amen
[1:31:13] are we together amen oh thank you
[1:31:18] god bless you
[1:31:20] and we realize who we are
[1:31:22] where we come from
[1:31:24] and that's why the individual
[1:31:28] starts his faith there
[1:31:30] he adds to his faith
[1:31:32] and when he asks his faith
[1:31:34] god gives him the holy spirit
[1:31:37] god will only accept your faith if you
[1:31:40] add it to your faith
[1:31:42] all these things that we see
[1:31:46] and somebody said amen amen
[1:31:48] can somebody say hallelujah hallelujah
[1:31:51] [Music]
[1:31:54] so
[1:31:54] i trust that god will certainly bless
[1:31:56] you amen and that his mercies will go
[1:31:59] with you
[1:32:00] and i know that
[1:32:02] we're just here to tell you
[1:32:04] of what we know in the scriptures and in
[1:32:07] the message
[1:32:08] there's nothing new
[1:32:10] under the sun
[1:32:11] but it's those nine different
[1:32:14] interpretations
[1:32:15] of the message that we have to worry
[1:32:18] about amen
[1:32:20] not that we have to worry about all we
[1:32:22] have to do is
[1:32:23] go by
[1:32:25] go by faith in the word of god because
[1:32:28] the message has brought you back
[1:32:30] to the word yes it's not a new message
[1:32:34] it's the message that paul preached
[1:32:37] bringing us back to the word so our
[1:32:39] heart has been turned
[1:32:42] to the word of god
[1:32:44] it's that simple friends
[1:32:46] so read your word
[1:32:48] read the message
[1:32:50] and the message will say what the word
[1:32:52] says
[1:32:53] the prophet says if it doesn't the word
[1:32:55] is right
[1:32:57] amen amen as simple as that
[1:32:59] may god bless you
[1:33:01] there's nothing new under the sun it all
[1:33:03] happened it's going to happen tomorrow
[1:33:05] it's going to happen again what already
[1:33:07] happened amen so what paul preached we
[1:33:11] will preach amen and it's that faith
[1:33:13] that will take us up
