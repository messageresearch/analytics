Johannesburg on Thursday 's youngest brother passed away so he went out for a funeral but you can't have you can't be a servant of God and you're in a city and he's not calling you out to preach so even if you're trying to hide in a city and they know that you're there they will call you to feed so after Adrian thought you can just go and sit in the church this morning I said no no you come and Minister for us so we pray that God will do his gift to be a blessing to the people out there in Johannesburg and we know that God will suit them a special blessing we know that we pray that God will come and speak to our heart this morning amen amen we all need expectations this morning yes I believe every time we come in the presence of the Lord we expecting something amen and especially in the hour that we're living in now yes we need the grace of God yes more now amen as we can see gross Darkness upon the Earth men that are failing for fear there's no prospects of any good life on the Earth right amen for this world has now come according to what the scripture says regarding nothing untoward is nothing that is unusual to us because it's something that was spoken of of the condition of the world and the condition of man but we assign God that he's delivered us from the spirit of the age and he's given us Providence amen he's given us all the things that we need to sustain us to keep us while we are here along this journey whatever things that we have need of is already provided for it amen maybe if it's a material need if it finances whatever he has we already have those things taken care of if it's healing those things are taken care of if it's delivered is taken care of Amen and in the word we have it in abundance the word is made plain unto us that's all under this third pool under the opening of the word the word has become plain to us and under the third call it's a mature church that you don't cry you speak the word yes amen and I know this third pool is also going to be those that are holy be holy still those that are filthy be fully Disturbed you're going to also be preaching to the souls that are lost in prison but your job is to continue to preach the gospel in power and demonstration and if not everybody might be called to preach but be it just too many let your life be a testimony and let the things that the good Lord has done for you be known unto others share your joy with him let them be astonished at the things that you are saying let them know that you have been with Jesus amen amen so we've got a Bible this morning we'll turn to the book of Saint John chapter 15 verses 5. like I said the last time if the presence of God is in something there must be a continuity there must be a consistency and there must be a progression the Church of God doesn't remain stagnant amen the Church of God don't receive something today they're excited about it they're rejoicing in next few days they're back to the Econo later amen if you've got the Holy Ghost there must be a consistent walk amen you've got your Bible listen to the people say in John chapter 15 verse 5. I am the Vine Yea are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him personal pronoun amen the same bringeth forth much fruit amen for without me yeah you can't do nothing so what is Jesus saying I have to abide in you and unless I abide in you you can't produce nothing but if you want to produce what divine produced then he must abide in you and you are the branches spreading foot from the Vine then the very life from the vine the very nature of the vine the very Spirit of the vine must abide in you and it will produce the same fruits amen amen we also turn to the book of Acts let's read from x three one this one I will thank you now Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother whom was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple was seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an um and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look on us she's not saying look at the scriptures look at what is prophesied look at the promise for the day he said look on us now these are the apostles that received the Holy Ghost after now this is after an upper room experience and the Holy Ghost is in them [Music] now they are saying to this man look on us we're not pointing into scripture they're not pointing into prophecy they're talking about present now while he's standing there they say look on us they're showing him they're going to demonstrate how scripture is being materialized through them so they say and he gave Eid unto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have now they he was looking for something from the natural something that he could see materially right but now something that he could not see in them because he's looking at the Khan is looking at the flesh he's looking at Peter and joining the flesh but the person that was talking to him wasn't from the flesh it was from within Peter amen amen when he said look on us what was that talking today to his other man it was the Holy Ghost through Peter amen [Music] and there was one was talking to this man and he said then Peter said silver and gold are by none but such as I have I give i z in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk what was that now the same Jesus that died that rose again he's here again amen amen there must be a continuity but now he's working through a people who have become the branches amen he said rise up and walked and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately Street an ankle bones receive strength and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God and all the people saw him walking and praising God yeah a miracle took place amen it also turned to the book of Acts chapter 4 verse 13. verse 13. now when they saw the bonus of Peter and John look at look at how it emphasized yet the boldness because the same Peter and John had Saint Peter had fear when they asked him if he was acquainted with Jesus and he denied him Thrice this is before the Holy Ghost but after receiving the Holy Ghost they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceive that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus so in other words they noticed them they noticed that these people we knew them we knew them from this area they were unlearned men but look at the bonus they have look at the knowledge they have then they had this now he's showing a characteristic that they had been with Jesus and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could not say nothing against it so first they took notice of them that they was boneless that it wasn't changing them amen there was a bonus upon them then they also took notice that the things that they are saying is not normal wisdom amen they were Marvel at the things they were saying because they know that they were unleaded men they know they knew that these men couldn't just speak of these things on their own yeah so they acknowledge that we were born and they were astonished at the things that they were saying and then there was a demonstration of the day was with Jesus amen by this miracle that took place and now nothing could be said about that because now it was Vindicated amen so they very the things that they professing they boneless and the way they're speaking is now being Vindicated by this miracle that the power of the Resurrection is upon them yes understand also the book of Acts 4 23-31 and being let go they went to their own company in other words they went amongst the Believers now it was amongst the unbelief now they're doing amongst the elected amen to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and Elder that said unto them and when they had heard that they lifted their boy up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant David I said why did the hidden rage and the people imagine real things the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ for if it should against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou has anointed both Avid and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel which gathered together for to do whatsoever that hand and thy Council determined before to be done and now Lord behold their threatenings so in other words a squeeze is coming upon them and Grant unto thy servants that will all boneless they may speak Thy Word say thank you they must be boneless when you're speaking of the word amen amen when we go out to speak of what God has done for us there must be a bonus about us we must not be embarrassed we must not be ashamed of what God has done for us amen um that we may speak Thy Word by stretching forth and hand to heal and that science and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken this is the place was shaken where where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they speak the word of God with boldness amen amen there is a continuity and a refilling all the time of the Holy Ghost amen he's not just a once of experience he might come another time someone else may be needing the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost will fall down there may be another lot of people already receive the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost will fall down amen he doesn't stop and the multitude of them that believed we have one heart and of one soul amen amen this morning I would like to speak on the acts of the Holy Ghost working in me amen I want you to make it a personal thing this morning the hacks of the Holy Ghost they were in the apostles amen the act of the Holy Ghost was in the prophet now it's the hands of the Holy Ghost working in me amen amen amen the Holy Ghost didn't stop Yes with the apostles the Holy Ghost didn't stop with William Branham amen the Holy Ghost there is a continuity amen there must be a people on the Earth where the Holy Ghost will come and indwell in them amen and the Holy Ghost wants to work in them the prophet of God says now the purpose what one what was God's purpose in sending the Holy Spirit it says John 14 beginning at the 14th verse and reading to the chapter for the basis God's purpose we find joy in setting the Holy Spirit was the one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plan through the church that God was in Christ's continuing his plans to Christ and out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the church Paul says in one Corinthians 2 4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and Power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God amen so you sing you see what is happening here now how the Holy Spirit works you can see the results amen there were stages there was processes firstly in your life there is God's way of receiving the holy ghost first there must be repentance [Music] then they must be the true baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then there's a promise of receiving the holy ghosts but he said Terry ye till you receive the Holy Ghost because when you receive him you will be endured with power amen power for what powerful service amen so the Holy Ghost can can do his acts working through you the Holy Ghost wants to work amen to demonstrate words that Jesus Christ is not dead amen how do we show that Jesus Christ people want to know how do we have proof that Jesus is risen from the dead the sign of the Resurrection is the acts of the Holy Ghost working in me working in you amen working through a many Amendment body that's the sign of the acts of the Holy Ghost sorry that's a sign of the Resurrection that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that is a sign that there is a continuity in the work of Christ that is a sign that the work is not stagnant amen he says and in the power of God ever put forth another church it will be another Pentecost and another book of Acts amen will be road behind it yes is that right because it's the Church of God Jesus said I am the vine here the branches you cannot bear fruit in yourself but I throw my own self into the branch and what kind of fruit did it bear these signs shall follow them that believe they must be the power and of the Resurrection the world must see the resurrected Jesus Christ now the words that he did people want to see e but look at the things that Jesus did in the Bible he wants to show them now you know what people say look at that in the Bible you want to see it now look at the The Works of the Holy Ghost through this brother look at the Holy Ghost through their brother look at the works of the Holy Ghost to the sister a present God Amen if we are claiming to be the branches from the vine of Jesus Christ that we must produce that fruit amen the second Church Rises up the mystical Body of Christ will have the same signs oh we're not talking about a future now we're talking about that now amen there was a time when his word was told up for the bride to come on the Earth but we're saying now it is the acts of the Holy Ghost Walking In Me yes don't look for the future tense we talk about a present tense God Amen now if you want the Holy Ghost working in you you've got to abide in a Vine amen amen and if you want the only ghost walking through you and you want him to perform these EX of the Resurrection then what does the Holy Ghost like what is the nature of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost want to feed upon the world the Holy Ghost want to dwell amongst the things of God Amen yes the Holy Ghost wants a consecrated vessel yes if you want to be a vessel that the Holy Ghost can use then you need to separate yourself from the things of this world you've got to separate yourself from all doubts from all negative thinking from all the carnal nature of Leticia is flourishing lerosia is praying the spirit of Leticia is spreading all over the Earth it is trending people are being influenced by the by this age amen but if you want to be have the Holy Ghost working you then God called for a consecrated life he calls for a total separation from unbelief everything that doesn't believe the plan of God separates itself from it amen yes [Music] and then you will see the same sign shall follow amen he said yet a little while the world see it be normal have we seen him we recognize that he's coming this day amen we claim to believe be message believer and we recognize that he's here amongst us amen can we see the way he breaks the bread yes you just see a preacher week after week in front of you or do you recognize that he is here amongst you that he is the one that's breaking the bread he's the one that is earning the things that you have need of because I'll tell you something if you're going to look at a man that's all you're going to receive yes amen then you're going to say from the man like like the like the the man at the gate beautiful he said he was baking harms and expecting harm from them something of the natural but what he didn't realize was in that man amen it was the Holy Ghost working in the man that was speaking to him thank you he says yet he shall see me for I will be with you that may not come in my word and even in you amen it must be in you amen in every branch to the end of the world he didn't stop anyway amen every brand that's coming from this Vine he will be with them till the end of this world Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's what the world is wanting to see the world the church world the people of this world don't have a solution because they are deceived already by the false prophets and false teachers amen they don't have the solution they want to see the same works of Jesus Christ [Music] the things that they call Sunday school lesson that they learned in a Sunday School the things that Jesus was doing in the Bible we should be producing them now amen amen that is why we heard this testimony was giving his testimonies to show that we don't talk about a God in the days gone by we're not just telling you about a God that was working in William Brennan yes amen yes we believe the message of William Brennan because the very God that was in William Branham brought us to believe this message amen amen the very God that was William Brothers he's doing the same work today the very God in William Branham that brought forth Deliverance is bringing Deliverance today that God and William Brenner that are doing the healing is doing the healing today [Music] amen amen he says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's how we show there must be the acts of the Holy Ghost In Me In You amen make it personal don't say oh the acts of the Holy Ghost in that church the accident no make it to yourself amen must be in you because the world will not see Jesus Christ out of you please get this get this in you get this digested within you and this is the reality if you're expecting some some great super duper thing to happen it's not going to happen the world's last opportunity this Gentile age this Gentiles dispensation that is closing now and we are at the end of the end of the Gentile dispensation amen the last opportunity this Gentile dispensation got to see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is through you and me amen there's no other age there's no other people getting to produce Jesus Christ apart from us yes because the gospel next goes to the Jews they'll receive the Holy Ghost but it's not for the Gentiles so the last Grace upon the Earth the last opportunity the last chance of a power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost is through you and I am [Music] hallelujah amen so there's a responsibility Upon Us amen um he says that's the Church of the Living God that's the way it is and that's the kind of a witness he has now also the church must teach baptism you must be baptized that was the commission Jesus said here in Mark 16 he that believeth and is baptized believe first and then be baptized with the remission of your sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now we know that the rain falls on just in the unjust there's many out there that claim to have the gifts of the Holy Ghost but they haven't come and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for them to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Peter had the key for the age and on the day of Pentecost he unlocked it the keys to the kingdom he said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and they shall receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost when you got the gift of the Holy that you must produce the gifts of the Holy Ghost and if you've got the Holy Ghost working in you you must say if you are a brand from the vine then you must produce the same fruits you must produce the fruits of the spirits because now you're not abiding yourself he said he is abiding in you and he must produce of himself amen you're not producing he said it out of yourself you can produce nothing you but you're producing of him amen and you are abiding in him the vine so what you are producing the Fruit of the Spirit he said and the Holy Ghost was will also come upon will be a teaching of the church for Jesus said in Luke 22 24 49 sorry yes and behold I send the promise of my father upon you wait in the city of Jerusalem until you're enjoyed with power from us so there's a time when we come into this message we come and we tarry in the word amen carrying the word we receive of the word and we're waiting I until we receive the power from on I and now when you go out you are effective for service and now the Holy Ghost will produce those X amen that is why if you go to the back to the book of Acts what's the bonus watch the apostolic mannerism what are you talking do you talk like a Believer when you're amongst the unbelievers or do you conduct yourself like them do you speak in the hope that you have when they don't have hope yes because they need Grace they need Jesus Christ to come and rescue them they are like when Jesus went to the Hearted Woman she needed to be saved she doesn't need to be criticized she even needed more condemning amen she needed Grace amen amen this world needs Grace amen the Bible says those that are filled with the Holy Ghost are crying and sang for the abomination of the Lost amen when God told Abraham I'm going to destroy Sodom and tomorrow what happened Grace projected the spirit of Christ Came Upon Abraham and he began to plead he began to intercede for his loved one amen don't be puffed up and say the Lord to another's world is going to be destroyed Oh California is going to sink the third one was and destroy the Earth and you're not insisted in Soul you're not you're not interested in saving people from hell and how are they gonna and when you go to tell them these things when you go to preach the gospel to them if you didn't talk and say you know God said a prophet and this is what he did in William bradham's day 96 1960 in 2023 you're telling me about 1960 but if I tell them about 1916 and I said by the same God there was there he's here today this is what he did in my life amen this is how he delivered me he took me a condemned person a person that couldn't help himself and he transformed My Life by his transforming power amen amen when he can take the violent Sinner and turn from his life amen thank you that is that man that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I mean what is the greatest Miracle taking someone that was lame there was and out of the wheelchair or is he taking the Violence Center and saving his soul from hell which is a great America amen the God's power of transformation you know a few weeks ago I went in took someone out of prison I went and helped him to come out of prison in the courts and when the person looked at me and I looked at I just felt I felt pretty on the young man and he said to me dead I need help I said now you have paid legal fees for me to take you out of prison but I'm going to help you for free to help your life to help yourself you say please his mom said please come and talk to him that's what the world needs how else to look at a soul amen a soul that might be far gone maybe you helped him come out of prison in the natural but you need to have to come to prison from the bondage of Satan amen the prison of this world the prison that will take them to hell this all need to be delivered amen amen you need to have compassion upon the souls because that's the acts of the Holy Ghost working in me amen each one of us got testimonies and I'm sure we can have a test too many nights because God is doing wondrous things amen but what is that what is those testimonies it's the acts of the Holy Ghost got to recognize the team you've got to recognize it because how do you know his presence is in it yes continuity there's consistency and there's progression the light must be changed the light must be transformed you can't be that baby Christian oh but the pastor never visit me yeah all these brothers never pray never call me when I was sick that is an immature Christian yes that is a denominational style Christian where you say oh the good old priest did this the good old priest prayed for the babies the good old priest visited me no we we are calling Sons and Daughters of God amen and if that only goes he's dwelling in you it will bring boldness upon you amen it will bring a maturity upon you amen you will ever work that is different amen people will recognize maybe one he was in the world and you had this drunk at work you know all the worldly walk all the games don't work you know the pants falling and things land but now when you've got the Holy Ghost there's a holy ghost work amen it's a walk of holiness he said but there must be a power and demonstration you must every word that you speak must be better yes if you go to a person at your workplace and they come to you under the anointing you deserve they have a problem tell me you haven't experienced that you you just discern because you tell them you start to speak to them but how do you know these things not you it's the Holy Ghost amen there must be a vindication they must know that God was with you amen they come to you at that time and you don't just pray you don't just suddenly pray for somebody you have to be led to pray for somebody amen so suddenly you decide to pray something makes you pray for somebody the way of indication of that because you know it wasn't you amen now that's the acts of the Holy Ghost if Christ would not let a bunch of men who had worked with him for three and a half years go preach any gospel or could not preach any gospel until they waited for the Holy Ghost the church today has to do the same thing wait for the holy ghosts uh let me put this to you in plain layman's terms if I send my son to the police force my son has to undergo training I cannot my son cannot come on his weekend pass and now act like a policeman and want to go use his foolish power he is not qualified as yet he's not certified at the police officer as yet he does not have the authority as his but when you come out of the tutoring when you come under the training ground and then he enjoys you with power for service and then you have the authority then you have the whole house of Heaven behind you amen then you can go and enforce the authority behind you amen because now he's gonna back you up amen amen every word that you're gonna speak he's gonna back up his words because you're not speaking of yourself you are speaking his word and if you are speaking his word he is obligated to back up his words amen that's why the prophet said take God at his word but he said they also be certain of God Amen so he says wait for the Holy Ghost then you've got the authority don't be like that man in the days of Paul when he wants to come now and he too want to go cast out the demons without the authority what happened to him he got a bad thing I experienced this I experienced this one night he was working night shift and we were called out there was this person that escaped from the mentally from the mental what at the hospital and he was a rugby player and he came in Durban boys College so when we arrived there he went up way up on the second floor or something left on the balcony on the ledge of the balcony there was a ladder and he was there performing as well bring up he said when I see police I kill that's that's the word that he said so all went up and there was a wall behind him as soon as I went up there I designed this is a demon Spirit we're dealing with I said in the name of Jesus Christ all your peace and he went like this I told a lot of people around me I said this is the spirit anyway those guys didn't want to listen they thought they got a lot of power because they there's a few of them and he was alone they underestimated the power of demons so one guy went behind him to talk to him to hold him from the from his neck and tried to pull him down into this you know in the you get a corridor in the stickies they tried to put him down this guy beat every one of them up badly they didn't listen to me now now when you are unbelief around you it's hard to cast for the spirit so what I did I used wisdom I started to buying that spirit I started to find him in the name of Jesus recording the book of Psalms I said see I'm telling you all this which normal person who just called the Bible there verbatim that's a demon the devil knows the Bible I find him abundantly sedated himself so it was a lesson learned you got to have the authority behind you to back up what you are saying do not come and say something without Authority amen that is why if I go and pray for a different case I won't just take anybody and I've experienced that in the past you get someone that's straight up that someone got his life right that demon will identify he'll tell you but see this is your problem he tells your form the devil will actually criticize you the deeper will tell you what sin you got he says what will it be the sign of the Resurrection the sign of the Resurrection will be done in a wicked and adulterous generation where are we now a sign seeking generation but you know why it is seeking science because they they tie in this they all rehear in their churches all they heard about a god of History they never saw any power demonstration so the only thing they could do now is seek out the sign they want to see this God they want to see this God so they produce science now a lot of lot of impersonations or the property from that time yes in in the latest case that there was all over the media case when I was when I was speaking to the intelligence service in the police they was telling me that what happened today in those meetings as the people arrived they use artificial intelligence they got your screen they screen your number plates whatever get your license and all that and they get everything about your life and then you come to the person he has told and so your name is social because they got a bio artificial your vehicle already came there and you'll sell them in the name tell them where they come from tell them all these things you see impersonations because there has been the real thing amen and they can't produce debts but they there are sons of God must do the same things there must be a discernment in the church again amen if we claim that there must be another book of Acts then there must be discernment where there'll be the time of ananias Safara in the church again discernment must be in the church to discern the hearts desert descending the church [Music] because what was stopping Joshua from winning the battle he was winning all the battles he had the angel of God before him he had the heart going before him but what caused it there was sin in the camera there must be Discerning to there must be discernment to take to call out sin if you want the only goes to work he cannot he's not a filthy spirit he is the Holy Spirit amen our bodies got to be consecrated the Temple of the Living God and he's got to come and feed upon the word word upon word we take the Bible line upon line precept upon precepts amen I've been moving from Glory unto glory and the Very word that we're eating the very word that we're digesting amen oh the Holy Ghost will now comfort and manifest itself just like if somebody is doesn't have anything he was emptied out 75 clean and then it doesn't allow the Holy Spirit to come in here because he doesn't have the word the right word then this demon powers come upon him and then the more you feed that demon Spirit maybe it's a spirit of drinking alcohol the word that he has to feed that spirit taking alcohol all the time that's why you find these people when they're taking the trance what are they doing they're feeding the spirit they're smoking is all what they're doing they're smoking the dissolved they call it it's all right some people call it kanja marijuana or whatever your colleagues we call it cannabis in the legal terms right they they smoke that's all and they have a drink and they're performing those X because they're feeding their spirits the demon spirit in them they're feeding their spirits so you find a person now if you've got a spirit in him how does he manifest to become that alcoholic if you go to the dream of alcohol 13 minutes feeding their spirits and then their Spirits are manifesting make him go crazy can't control himself it starts to manifest itself and just like that if you got claimed you have the Holy Spirit then you need to feed the Holy Spirit of the word word upon word upon word and then in the right time he starts to manifest himself now you come to vindicate his word you call out his word in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk you must vindicate that word in the name of Jesus Christ I'm having this financial problem I speak Lord that you'll open up your windows of Heaven pour out your blessings upon me amen I'm not talking about I'm not quoting you I'm telling you about reality I'm telling you about us seeing this Jesus amen coming and manifesting his word in every circumstance in every situation you might be sitting here today and saying but my circumstances are far-fetched no one will understand my problem that's because you and you want to handle your problem yeah you want to contain your problem within yourself you think your problem is too big for God then you understand it in God you think your problem is so big so what you say about God dear are you are you saying this God is he's so little to your problem he said lay your problem that is him he said my burdens are left lay a problem in my feet take it and lay at the feet of Jesus and leave it there leave it amen let him come and work it amen he work on both ends you love him this morning amen amen amen so he says a wicked in a dancer's generation was done in the book of Acts Jesus raised from the dead came into Peter came into James came into John and the apostles and they did this book of Acts it wasn't the Acts of the Apostles it was the acts of the Holy Ghost working in the apostle amen that we sing We are preaching a message oh the supernatural things happening our day the supernatural happened in the days of William Branham then that same resurrection power must come now upon me must come upon you then it must be the acts of the Holy Ghost again working in US amen it's not a man today it's the Holy Ghost working through a man or men see that does you see he's not talking about the individual it must come through this bride this body we claim to be the body of Christ amen Amen in other words we claim to be working upon the Earth for Christ we claim to be the one that's here now a working body and it better be a working body because when Christ was on the earth he wasn't working he was working amen Christ was laboring yes yes Christ was not still when his ministry started until until the crucifixion and resurrection and Ascension he was working yes day and night he toils he labored amen he sacrificed In The Same Spirit of Christ is yeah amen comes upon the prophet he does the same thing the prophet was working the prophet of laboring the problem is toiling and now we come and receive the same word it must produce the same thing amen amen until the consummation until we have because we are waiting for that body chain he says the Holy Ghost working through a man that does the work he said the man just a vessel but the Holy Ghost is the oil too and look what they did look at the signs that they've done of Jesus they are to take notice of them you see are people taking notice of us when they did this miracle after the man of heal they sent Israel took notice that his men had been with Jesus because why the same signs yes we are saying Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever must produce the same signs that's why the prophet when he was Russia and he saw the miracle of the boy being raised from the dead he says he said the communist country this is the god that they'll believe when they see the resurrection power amen this world right now they don't have hope yes don't go tell them to you don't go speak theology to them they are means they have circumstances go and speak to the needs God broke his tied to the needs when layers of the sick let them recover and then they will start to believe you then they'll see it as God and then you can now go tell them come because what do we do to be the same depends every one of you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he didn't say must of baptism in any power until the confirmation until he comes again we must be baptizing we must be speaking bringing people to repentance people must be convicted they must have a fear of God you know what America takes place the first thing to do the people recognize that God did that and then suddenly now they'll start a fear of God comes upon them that's what happened when the people saw the Miracles they began to have a fear of God upon them maybe there was unbelievers maybe he was living their own lives but now they recognize no that God is amongst us amen we're going to be cautious how we've said we've got to be cautious of the things we say we've got to be cautious how we're moving and if we sing God amongst us right now God is amongst us and we should be have that fear of God upon her we should have holy living holy consecrated lives amen and look what they did the signs that Jesus they did the sign sorry I look at the signs that they've done of Jesus they had to take noses of them because they were ignorant they were unlearning Peter and John or they had to take notice to them they had been with Jesus they done the thing that he did so you see every the four books the four gospels God the Pentecostal blessing with every scripture to back up exactly what they said and now the Acts of the Apostles when they came today with the Full Gospel that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so we know that the book of Acts the the gospels that God it is guarded until you have the right way to come to the key to the kingdom but through repentance true baptism and then you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and then that gospels now become open becomes in plain view it becomes Vindicated because the signs that Jesus did must be done now amen when the when the when the gospel is no longer guarded now amen and you come the right way to True repentance true baptism and come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost then what happened that same Jesus Christ comes on the scene again amen he's no longer now yesterday is it today and forever amen because why when Peter started to unlock deaths and after the upper home experience what happened Jesus the gospels are unlocked now he's walking through the book of Acts amen you see the secrets the prophet of walking in them amen and look what they now see what he says here now Pentecost after Pentecost wrote a book of what he said acts of the Holy Ghost he's at rights he's talking about after that experience in the upper room so after your experience after your experience of receiving the Holy Ghost what are you writing are you becoming living are we writing another book of Acts upon the others or we are just continuing the gospel for ourselves are we keeping the gospel within ourselves this message are we keeping it within ourselves or are we going and producing the book of Acts he said prophesy again before Nation tongue and kings and when you prophesying there must be a vindication in other words you're going to say them that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever this Jesus that you read about in the Bible it came in our day and this is what he's doing now there must be a Vindication amen God must back up his word but you gotta you gotta take his word by faith you can't just gonna say okay I think the scripture said this decent shall follow them that believe in fact they shall recover okay let's see no you gotta believe it you gotta have faith to believe it amen you gotta believe that he's with you I just gotta act upon these words you gotta believe that when you speak when you speak his word when you take that promise that is given unto you in his word he must come and act upon his word amen you must believe that yes that's why he said do not use the word of God in vain you can't use it in vain you've got to use it by faith that's why when you come under the tradition of the Holy Ghost and now your mature son and you give thee all the authority now now he enjoys your towel from an eye now you've got the authority you got the backing amen so every word you speak God is backing and if he's backing you up you must come and do what he did there he says what does The X start of with the first thing to enter into salvation you see Acts 2 38 says repent every one of you because the Earth they sing Peter they saw Peter and all that they know they were fearing before but not they thought that boldness in them and plus kissing the manifestation because whatever language that they came from and Peter is just speaking one language right Peter does not speaking different language he is speaking in one language but he's projecting in their own language amen so when you got the Holy Ghost and you're talking to that man down the street whatever you need is when you're speaking under the Holy Ghost he's understanding you because he knows that you wouldn't know his needs yes you wouldn't know his circumstance like oh they saw people they wouldn't speak that language these men are Galilean they wouldn't speak our language how can they speak my language how can I understand them in my language what they are saying that man will say but this person doesn't know my need then they will recognize that God is with you amen the first thing he said he has the last one around is it right there was all full with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak with other tongues and Peter stood up and preached them a sermon then they said what can we do how we going to get into that and he gives them repent he baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ you said now remember God had some gods for that Mercy seats what is that Mercy Seat that God met you on the East look Matthew Mark Luke and John all of their four gospels vindicate the book of Acts to come they guard it any way you want to look at it so you that is why to unlock what Jesus did the sign that Jesus did to unlock that you've got to come by Acts 2 38. and then it unlocks that and then there will be a vindication of all the things that Jesus was doing while he was on Earth must do it through his body he said greater things than this shall too why now it's a many-membered body in that day you shall know that the father was in me and I in you in that day you'll understand now what if Nevada is talking about what he meant because everything you're doing while he was in the flesh body it was God working through him amen it was the Holy Ghost insecting him Holy Ghost giving you wouldn't do something to the father showed them until you see your vision then you act then there you'll understand and now he's in you and everything that you do you are instructed by him you understand your whole life as a guide that's why he said yeah you have a guide amen he's here to guide you he's here to instruct you he's here to give you leadership and therefore you'll never need to go to a certain place to find some people why something will stop you say don't go there I want you to take this route I want you to visit this person I want you to call this person and you realize that when you call the person the person has a need for sometimes the Lord will bring someone to your thought and say pray for them yes and you realize you've been praying for this person by this person at his name yes the other day a call from the commissioner from the commissioner's office the person spoke to me with this saying no I need you to go to a certain place because you know your minister they're having these things I said no no I don't compromise I wouldn't go with his other religious jokes you know I started telling them their needs the things that they have need of and they were just astounded I said I said who made your phone they couldn't understand I just thought of you because it was tired is religious and all that who made you phone me the Holy Ghost instructed you to call me yes yes that's why I said is the acts of the Holy Ghost working in me working in you I sucked I said you called me I sent you all these things now did I talk any politics to you did I talk about anything negative to you did I tell anything Cardinal to you he said no I said to ask you to call me I said it's the Holy Ghost because now the things that I told you is what's needful for you yeah so you see what I'm talking about we're living in the hour if you've got the Holy Ghost you'll have discernment that's why someone can be quiet someone can just be you'll just know what you're thinking about then you just keep quiet you go into circumstances maybe you had your colleagues at work and you can see the God will show you don't talk to them no more or say this thing can you give me the right word to say [Music] x three one just turn our Bibles in the Book of Matthew chapter 13. [Music] hey man you love the Lord [Music] Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 1-23 the same day when Jesus out of the house he sat by the seaside and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and said and the whole multitude stood on the shore and he spoke many things unto them in parables saying be holy saw when for the soul and when he sowed some seeds fell by the wayside and the followers came and devoured them up some fell upon Stony places where they had not much Earth and with they strung up because there are no deepness of Earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no roots they witted away and some fell among thorns and the thorn sprung up and choked them but others fell into good ground and brought forth fruits someone under the Fallen summoned 64. who had yours who had ears to your lady mirror the disciples came under him came and said unto him why speaker thou unto them in Parable see for them it's terrible and he answered and said unto them because it was given unto you but to them it was given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given yes for whosoever had to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever nuts from him shall be taken away even that he had therefore speak I to them in Parable because they see and see not and you're in the year not neither do they understand and in there we fulfill the prophecy of assayas would say by hearing yes and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is wet grass and the Earth are done of hearing and the years they have closed left at any time they should see with their eyes and you should understand with their art and should be converted see it wasn't meant for them to be converted because he works with predestination he already thought so that they wouldn't believe you amen just be destination God forso who will believe him God for so who wouldn't believe him because he's all knowing god amen and I should tell heal him heal them but blessed are your eyes for the sea in your ears for the year perfectly I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which they see and have not seen them and to hear the things which are here and have not heard them therefore the parable of the sword for when one year the word of the Kingdom and understanding it not again come with the wicked one and catch the way that which were thrown in his hearts so you see we can be sitting here today and you can hear the messages and you understand it not in other words the holy spirit is not there to show it to reveal it to you then what he says here because the bigger one can't come if you got the Holy Ghost right but he says if you understand it not then the then come up the wicked one and catch the way that which was thrown in his heart so that's e is he which receive and Seed by the wayside but he that received the seed in Stony places the same is he that year at the word and the nun with joy receive it yet add in no not true in himself but Jordan for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by it is offended he also that receive it so you see what everyone is on Stony places now persecution arises when tribulation arises he said oh but Lord I believe your word I believe this message but why are all the things happening you see your carnal thoughts are coming then you don't know how to exercise that word by faith he that he also that receive it seed among the Thorns he that Hearth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he become an unfruitful you see though he received the word but he's got all this he's too EarthBound he's too engrossed with the things of the world and all the cares of his life the thing that he must do tomorrow with his work and his finances and all the things that he must do he's worried about that but not worried about his astrology is not God you see where his property is now if his priority was the things of God then everything else will come right seek him first the kingdom of God and is righteousness then all these things shall be added unto you the Bible says delight yourself in the Lord and he shall Grant you the desires but he will choke the word and it becomes must be for truth amen but he that receiveth seed into the good ground you see that in other words yeah he came the right way number two repentance come by through baptism and the ground was right now amen because why he left out of himself letter of the world Amen emptied himself out he's ready now to receive of the spirit God can only use you the amount you want him to use you amen he only came to full you up if you let out if you let out of yourself and allow him to fool you he will fill you like Pastor Adrian was preaching the holy spirit is a gentleman he will not come he never the church is a female he won't come and force himself onto her the devil does that the devil goes and ravishes the church world but the holy spirit is a gentleman amen as much as you would allow him that's the amount he will use you amen so you say Lord take all of me amen Wednesday to Boaz at the threshing floor yes listen to the mother-in-law's instruction amen and be like Esther you're going to create soil when the king soil you could offer even to half of the Kingdom because the characteristic was right the character was right the nature was right amen and if you will love him with your heart but if you've got no time for him if you're more interested in your own program and he's not going to force himself don't think the Lord is suddenly just going to come and give you all these things the Lord is just gonna suddenly produce the acts of the Holy Ghost through you no no it has to be your surrendered life your consecrated individual life do not rely upon your mother and father do not rely upon the Ministers of the church do not rely upon the Elders of the church do not rely upon the church but it's an individual walk it's an individual choice that you chose now to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ is an individual Choice Lord I Surrender my thoughts I Surrender my old being Lord I surrender to you Lord I am that vessel of one come and use Me O God for your service amen but he doesn't receive with the seed of the good God he's either here at the word and understanding it and which also beared fruit and bring it fought fruit from an unfold and some 60 and some 30 it must produce fruit must produce Jesus Christ again amen the same works that he did must be produced again amen it must produce the fruit of the spirit amen Joy love long-suffering peace all these things Temperance godliness amen all these things that bring you even to a statue of a perfect man you must produce all those things you can't have all those things that deceive yourself to say no the Holy Ghost must work through me now the Holy Ghost will produce another book of Acts they have to carry there they have to wait till the Holy Ghost come upon them be there to be converted first amen that's what Jesus said I pray that you be converted there must be a conversion and when you have a conversion God transforming power transforming your life you're waiting now for the Redemption of your body but you already turned Heavenly amen why are you in the natural body the already partakers of the divine nature amen amen what that mean you ought to be turned Heavenly while you never receive your body change you turned Heavenly because the nature changed amen your thinking has changed amen the thoughts have changed you are now seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus your thinking is no longer Earthly your thinking is of the Heavenly because your influence is not from beneath your influence is from above [Music] he said what we need is not education we need the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost back in the church to demonstrate the power of Jesus sorry to demonstrate the power Jesus never said go into all the world and teach he never said go into all the world he said sorry he said go into all the world and preach the gospel and the gospel is to us to demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost amen amen the Holy Ghost is powerful the Holy Ghost is the active force of God Amen he wants to demonstrate the power what power the power of the Resurrection who is still a million mile shot than where we should be let us move forward let us go back where we left him in the Feast of Pentecost so you see God who's doing the work from the beginning of this here in the church because we've come to a realization that we're not where we ought to be and after we take in that decision led by the Holy Spirit and each family each individual started to consecrate their lives we started going to spiritual discipline everyone should be prayerful everyone should be surrendering themselves amen what happened when we started to do that now you made the ground rights we started to create the right atmosphere because the atmosphere must be right for the Holy Ghost to come in the Holy Ghost can't come in atmosphere where someone is on the Wayside believer amen you're either in or you're out the Holy Ghost cannot work with a lukewarm believer the Holy Ghost once they surrendered lives he wants a consecrated life and if his life is consecrated ask what you will and you shall receive you say no I've got a family member with chicken with cancer what is impossible with God he's the same yesterday today and forever oh but God healed in the days of William we can still do it today yeah yeah he hasn't changed [Music] oh my family member okay far-fetched in the world as soon as God all of them and then now the spirit of alcohol is upon them and nothing can be done no God can transform a power on a person overnights amen when the Holy Ghost come he comes with power burnouts all the darkness from him burn out all the sin from them amen he said Jesus said in John 15 chapter he said I am Divine I was going back to cinema yeah the branches well like that vine put forth the first branch and out of that Branch wrote a book of Acts the second Branch will make another book of Acts the third branch will make another book of Acts and every brand that comes out of that vine will be the same as the first Branch one man amen can somebody say I am that book of Acts amen amen can somebody say the the acts of the Holy Ghost working in me amen yes amen let's say that the acts of the Holy Ghost working in me amen hallelujah amen this is the hour where there must be another book of Acts amen people must see Jesus Christ again yes yeah crying out you don't know what to do they don't have the answer you have the answer you was given the Keys of the Kingdom you have given the opportunity to see these things to them it's made incredible Amen to damn it to you is revealed plainly amen so if it's reveal to you go and share it it's not meant for them but go and produce the book of Acts because they don't have the answer you got the secrets amen they don't have you have the answers that they don't have dating the days of Miracle of us the days of Bible miracles all these things are just Biblical history he says now you can draft I've seen a citrus tree with about eight different kinds of food on it I've seen an orange tree putting for grain fruits and lemon and everything else on it but they were drafted in that's what the matter today we drafted in our own ideas drafted in our denomination in a message I could say we drafted in message theology different time to to hop on certain things and instead of allowing the Holy Spirit to move people denominated around a certain Doctrine and they closed the people they closed the work of the Holy Ghost out they wouldn't even want to fellowship with other people because they denominated around a certain Doctrine only but if that tree ever put forth another fruit wine itself it will be like the original ones that went into it oh church WIll blend together but we need the power of the original we need the Holy Ghost the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's what he told us [Music] amen he said we don't need a denominator denomination we don't need a new church balloon what we need today is an old time backwards sky blue sin killing Pentecostal Revival that was born at Pentecost I'm not talking about the Pentecostal denomination we are the true Pentecostals amen amen I'm not talking about people call himself Pentecostal denomination we are the true Pentecost best because it's an experience amen and he's back into the church again the power of the Holy Ghost again to bring Jesus under scene the god of History always Rises on the scene in a crucial moment oh sometimes I find yourself in the difficulty oh Lord why am I in this difficulty sometimes the Lord allows this thing to happen to demonstrate the power of the Gospel sometimes the Lord allowed someone to be sick so that you can be on the scene to pray for them and God will come back his word amen sometimes it might be a debt in the family and you wonder why why they have to be this get in the family but because of the death of the family maybe somebody got saved maybe someone's away I'm living my life fooling around I'm living my life Loosely thinking that I'm just gonna live and live and carry on sometimes death makes a person think that you can be taken away any time you're not dead you can also bring your people to repentance when you experience someone dying then you realize how you can just be taken over the scene anytime so God has different ways of working in different circumstances but he says the god of History always Rises on the scene in a crucial moment we need it that's what's the matter with our church be we're getting too far back we're falling into the Fashions of the world and gradually year by year it begins to die a little in with their way [Music] pruning time pretty soon God will cut it back as sure as I'm standing in this Pulpit God will cut her back to make a bare fruits he will cut the works of the world out of it one of these days how many of you can say we are experiencing those days God is bringing us into that stage of bearing fruits God is bringing us to the stage yes he's saying it here um as Joy I'm standing in his Pulpit God will cut her back is the prophet talking about are we talking about now we can see he will cut the works of the world out of it one of these days amen is God not working amongst us can we now say God will produce a book of Acts or can we say God is producing currently the acts of the Holy Ghost In Me God is producing another book of Acts to us that will do he is watch what he says he's going to raise a people up just as certainly abstaining in his purpose he will raise the people for his namesake out of the Gentile generation he will do it there's no other Gentile age left we are at the end of the end of the Gentile dispensation we can't look for another people to come to produce this this is that there was spoken by William Bradham it's the Jews time right at air now and of the Gentiles are ending out but they just went on out he is rejecting Christ and rejecting the sign they're rejecting everything that's called Godly and brand it's some kind of telepathy or devil power be blaspheming the Holy Ghost have we not seen them in this day Supernatural Cloud that's the Holy Ghost comes down in the home of seven angel less swimming these are Supernatural things that they bless swimming and God will take that Minority after a while and raise it up into a powerful Church and then turn the spirit to the Jews and take the Gentile home exactly right she's in the making now we had an intern how many of you can take this and say this is that I have heard but now I see amen because the gospel is good to go back to the Jews they've got to be the church again producing Jesus Christ again I'm talking about in your daily I'm not talking about I'm not talking about something in a mass meeting or something I'm talking about Beyond close those the death widow woman beard close door she had need of nothing everything that you have made of to sustain it to keep her to life was there behind closed doors when Elijah the prophet came on the scene daily you'll be experiencing miracles maybe you're not flashing enough but you know what I'm talking about because you are taking God at his word you say brother this tough Economic Times we're living in difficult Economic Times and if you read the news he's gonna even depress you even further they will tell you they can't world economies are crashing they have no hope but he says I will never leave you no forsake you I will be with you till the very end then he said don't take thought what food you're gonna eat what clothes you're gonna wear he said if you were a wicked can give good gift to your children how much your heavenly father is Holy good give give good gifts unto him provider [Music] the same one that produced The Realm for Abraham you know the same one that when the prophet spoke this squirreled into existence could use that the same under Moses when he spoke with frogs and those plagues in Egypt he's here today amen amen if you are believing that this same Holy Ghost is in you but it's not time to cry like a baby time to speak to exercise your faith by speaking the word and if you speak the word he will back up his words amen because he said I will give you even to have the kingdom power he wants to demonstrate believe me God wants to demonstrate the power of the Resurrection more than you and I even think of it he wants to show that he's the same yesterday today and forever but we don't want to take him by his words we don't want to exercise our faith and speak the word the world is wanting to see Christ Jesus I am Divine here the brother and the branch Bears record of the vine because it draws his energy and life from the Vine well the first Vine first branch that came from this Vine they wrote a book of Acts behind the branch we see that we see the way the Holy Spirit acted in the first church the church of Pentecost and then we believe that if this original vine ever put forth another brand they'll write another book behind another book of Acts behind it because it's the same life that's in the Bible amen and that's the quality Jesus won that's the quality of what he wants in his church that we are partakers of the Divine producing the same from the Bible if you're drawing from the Bible drawing from the Vine with a branch produced that same fruit because it's got the life of the vine amen the life comes from the Bible can't produce another life the world you must see Jesus Christ once again amen he says let me just give you the last code no wonder they don't get no way but go back to the denomination and make a bunch of dressed up polished up people intellectual educated never get anywhere because that's what they display that's all they do but Believers take the token and what Jesus begin to do in Galilee he continues to do now through his display of the token of the Holy Spirit back upon the church so it was not the Acts of the Apostles it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles and that was a token so if the acts of the Holy Ghost In You acts of the Holy Ghost in me that is the token [Music] they said they had to take heed to Peter and James Peter sorry Peter and John as they passed through the gate called Beautiful seeing they were ignorant they might have said because they had the grammar they couldn't understand them they might not have known the difference mathematics of the scripture but they had to notice they had been with Jesus they could just play their token because that same Spirit was upon him before his crucifixion was upon them after the resurrection now they might not believe the message they may not believe the things you're saying them they better not understand it but they have to take notice amen that Jesus Christ is with you they might not believe this Prophets but when they see the same works it was done in the days of the prophet and the same Works being produced the same Jesus now is producing The Works through you they must take notice of it they might not believe this message that we are preaching but they will say by these people they can't produce these things on your own Jesus is with them amen now that is the acts of the Holy Ghost working in US amen they say no I don't understand the Supreme seat I can't see it brother but brother you know when you pray for me the day I must tell you after you left this is what happened this is why in the Bible it is right they must take notice what you was which that Jesus is with you amen they must take notice this person I know their life in the past but there's something different about them there's a change about them the way this person speak you know what I I spoke to him years ago I met him now again and every time I see him this is the same saying the same thing they're consistent amen there is a consistency about their life there's people that spoke on a message many years ago in a family but you know what I must see I only can see Jesus through them this family member of mine they said they have such a humble nature they have a nature of Christ only can see Jesus they always want to help they always want to do something there's something lovely about them I don't know what it is but it has to be Jesus amen you see what I'm saying they see this consistency in you and then you go but you know you see this was that happening right now in Russia in Ukraine you know the Bible speaks about this about his last kingdom is that's coming upon the Earth you know what the Bible says this over America I was to see a progression now from the things that you've spoken years ago you're showing them this word he's still alive it's a present word amen you're not talking about 1965 only then 55 coming forward yes progressing 2000 has happened what happened to World Trade extended 2005 what happened the tsunamis earthquakes in diverse places okay what happened there in Arab Spring what happened there you know these are all these other ones the rumors are wires and so forth what is happening now I'm about to go to World War III hey every time these people telling me something present who amen you see what I'm saying this is not a dead God this is a living God this is the living gospel that's the power of the Resurrection Resurrection Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever thank you amen the sister oh don't let everyone say but here's the door you talk about me holy Jesus now she's gone modernized me she's putting makeup for putting some lipstick when she goes no that's not a True Believer a True Believer say you know what what they did years ago they're still doing today same people consistency amen what it was Jesus Christ the same yesterday [Applause] pray the Lord bless you this morning amen that's what it is that's what it's all about the hacks of the Holy Ghost working in me the acts of the Holy Ghost working in you the acts of the Holy Ghost working through a many membered body because the age when The Headstone comes down kept the body amen to bring this church to be seated now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus making
