[1:09] [Music]
[1:27] hey man so this evening we'll speak on a
[1:29] little thought called our assignment is
[1:31] to finish the mission
[1:33] our assignment is to finish the mission
[1:37] amen let's turn to exodus two and one
[1:40] exodus chapter 2 and this deals with the
[1:42] birth of moses
[1:44] and there was a man of the house of levi
[1:48] now we know levi is that priestly lion
[1:53] and took to wife a daughter of levi
[1:57] so you can see it's thoroughbred
[2:00] priesthood
[2:01] and the woman conceived
[2:03] now the word can only bring forth word
[2:06] amen every seed must bring forth of its
[2:09] kind you just read what kind of word
[2:11] this was
[2:13] levi would levi so what do you think
[2:15] they would produce
[2:17] they would produce a word born
[2:20] this is coming fresh
[2:24] they would produce a word born son
[2:26] [Music]
[2:28] and listen to what it says here in two
[2:30] and the woman conceived and bears son
[2:33] and when she saw him that he was a
[2:35] goodly child
[2:36] she hit him for three months
[2:38] and when she could no longer hide him
[2:41] she took for him an ark of bull rushes
[2:44] and dabbed him with slime and would
[2:46] pitch and put the childhood in and she
[2:48] laid it with the flags by the river's
[2:51] brink amen you may be seated just
[2:54] reading that verse alone exodus two and
[2:56] three when she could no longer hide him
[2:59] there's gonna come a time when you can
[3:01] no longer hide the word that is being
[3:03] made flesh in you amen you've got to
[3:06] show signs amen that you have conceived
[3:09] conception has taken place
[3:11] the baby starts to grow
[3:14] you may have been able to conceal it for
[3:16] a time
[3:17] maybe you've been ashamed to tell people
[3:19] that you're in the message of the hour
[3:21] but when that word starts to take a hold
[3:24] of you
[3:26] and it starts to form the process of a
[3:28] new birth within you
[3:30] you can no longer hide it
[3:33] like moses mother tried to hide him you
[3:35] have been called here for a specific
[3:37] purpose in this life and we must be
[3:39] conscious of the fact that we've only
[3:42] been allotted a certain amount of time
[3:44] the bible says it's three score and ten
[3:47] some of us go
[3:49] by the way of death even sooner some may
[3:51] go in the teens maybe when they're 20 30
[3:55] 40 50.
[3:57] no man know what
[3:59] the number of these days
[4:01] you know if you are pregnant now with
[4:03] modern science they can probably predict
[4:05] the time that you will be born on the
[4:07] earth
[4:08] but they cannot predict when you will
[4:10] leave the earth
[4:12] that has been allotted to god
[4:15] so we have a certain
[4:16] number of days that's been allotted to
[4:18] us on the earth and we should approach
[4:20] every day
[4:22] every hour with this in mind
[4:25] now when we live conscious of this
[4:27] it'll change our lives
[4:29] jesus asked one time
[4:31] don't you know i must be about my
[4:33] father's business
[4:35] he had an assignment that he needed to
[4:36] carry out and he was so determined to
[4:39] fulfill his purpose
[4:41] he had three and a half years
[4:43] to carry out the will of the father and
[4:46] he did not have time to be distracted
[4:48] with the cares of this life
[4:51] the fate of the world was hanging in a
[4:52] balance and jesus
[4:55] was on a mission to save man from his
[4:57] fallen state of sin
[5:00] now if jesus walked so conscious
[5:02] to the will of the father and the
[5:04] purpose that he had
[5:07] we who are part of him that we now claim
[5:10] that we know this hidden mystery that we
[5:11] are the wife of the lord jesus christ
[5:15] that was taken from his very own side
[5:18] then we his wife must know that we have
[5:20] been put on the earth to carry out an
[5:22] assignment
[5:25] a covert operation that has to do with
[5:27] the redemption of man
[5:29] first corinthians 1 and 21 it says he
[5:32] please god by the foolishness of
[5:35] preaching to save them that believe
[5:40] and in 25 it says because the
[5:43] foolishness of god is wiser than men
[5:47] and the weakness of god is stronger than
[5:50] men we that have been born again
[5:53] the prophet says we don't see things the
[5:55] way the world see things
[5:57] because we are from another world
[6:01] their spirit comes from above where
[6:03] there's holiness and righteousness
[6:05] dwells
[6:07] you must have come to a realization
[6:10] when you had that encounter with god
[6:12] that you were not from this world
[6:15] that is why brother branham came to a
[6:17] stage in his life and he said i am no
[6:20] longer the son of charles and ella
[6:22] branham
[6:24] he realized he was from another world
[6:28] the spirit that is from heaven
[6:31] from the seventh dimension came to the
[6:34] earth to influence and lead men and
[6:36] women of god
[6:38] but ask ourselves are we allowing the
[6:41] spirit to lead us he says any born again
[6:44] christian is an oddball to the world
[6:47] because
[6:48] you've been changed
[6:50] you're from another world your spirit is
[6:52] from across the chasm
[6:54] if you're not different there's
[6:56] something wrong
[6:57] you're still too earthbound
[7:00] you ought to be heavenly minded and
[7:02] heaven lives by the word
[7:05] now the prophet says that to reach the
[7:07] point of no return
[7:09] means that you're closer to the other
[7:10] side than from the point where i started
[7:14] and i feel that's where the bride is
[7:16] right now
[7:17] at the point of no return
[7:19] all bible prophecy regarding seven
[7:22] church age messengers have come to pass
[7:26] the seven stars that were in the hand of
[7:28] our lord jesus christ when he's standing
[7:30] in the midst of seven golden
[7:32] candlesticks which type the seven church
[7:34] ages
[7:36] all of that has been fulfilled
[7:38] each one of those stars have been
[7:40] reproduced on the earth they have been
[7:43] clearly identified
[7:45] they have called out a people
[7:47] so we have reached a point point of no
[7:49] return like the prophet describes it i'm
[7:52] closer to the other side than i am from
[7:55] the point where i started so we are at
[7:58] the finish line in fact when we look
[8:00] through the eyes of prophecy you've got
[8:02] to admit we can see the finish line
[8:05] and we have this great cloud of
[8:08] witnesses
[8:09] we have this great cloud of witnesses
[8:12] in the sixth dimension
[8:14] that is looking
[8:16] beyond the cutting of time
[8:18] and are telling us keep pressing on
[8:21] keep pressing on
[8:23] as much as you can see the finish line
[8:26] they can see you approaching them
[8:29] because they without us cannot be made
[8:31] perfect
[8:33] so our lives must be so submitted
[8:36] to the assignment
[8:38] we've got to be so committed to the
[8:40] assignment those of you that are
[8:41] studying you know if you get an
[8:44] assignment regarding your studies if you
[8:46] do not complete your assignment you do
[8:48] not get graded you do not get your marks
[8:51] so just like that god has given us an
[8:53] assignment but he has not left us alone
[8:56] god knew that in our fallen condition
[9:00] we would need help from a supernatural
[9:02] world
[9:04] because the battle did not start in a
[9:07] natural world
[9:09] the battle started in heaven in a
[9:12] supernatural world
[9:14] and the battle that started in heaven
[9:16] was brought down to the earth
[9:20] and when it came down to the earth
[9:23] man fell
[9:25] at the slightest temptation of fallen
[9:28] angels
[9:29] man fell
[9:30] so god knew that man needed the
[9:33] assistance of a supernatural world
[9:37] and since the beginning of time adam's
[9:39] race has always been connected with the
[9:42] supernatural world there's no denying it
[9:45] if we follow the bloodline of adam's
[9:47] race you will find that we have been
[9:50] connected to that supernatural world
[9:53] and our connection to that supernatural
[9:56] world
[9:57] is the holy ghost
[9:59] the spirit of god was sent to dwell
[10:02] within man
[10:05] and that makes him
[10:07] one with his maker
[10:09] that makes him omnipotent
[10:11] amen
[10:14] god wants to live within us god wants to
[10:17] speak to us
[10:18] now he goes on to say he says as we walk
[10:22] upon the streets and rub hands with the
[10:24] world we are not supposed to be like
[10:27] those he says we step aside and give
[10:30] them their place talking about the
[10:32] worldly people he says lord we'll take
[10:34] the back seat knowing that we are
[10:37] delegates from another world
[10:39] we have a kingdom that's coming into
[10:41] power and our great king will soon
[10:44] arrive and take over all the kingdoms
[10:47] that's in his domain and he shall rule
[10:49] and reign with him on earth thousand
[10:52] years and be with him forever let's read
[10:55] galatians
[10:56] chapter 5 verse 7.
[10:58] we started the race we sang we had the
[11:01] finish line we sang we've reached the
[11:03] point of no return but sure did some of
[11:06] the first believers
[11:08] and listen what the apostle paul is
[11:10] telling them
[11:11] he said you did run well who did into
[11:14] you
[11:15] that you should not obey the truth
[11:19] he goes on to say that this persuasion
[11:22] cometh not of him that calleth you the
[11:24] one who is hindering you in your
[11:26] christian walk is not the one who called
[11:29] you the one who called you has given you
[11:31] a specific mission on the earth
[11:34] and our assignment is to finish that
[11:37] mission
[11:39] don't go to the grave having not
[11:41] completed your mission on the earth
[11:44] if god has given you an assignment
[11:47] if god has made you
[11:49] let me give you an example if god has
[11:52] designed you that you were to
[11:55] be a writer of songs
[11:57] don't go to the grave
[12:00] without having those songs expressed
[12:04] without writing those songs
[12:07] don't go to the grave if god has given
[12:09] you a gift or maybe writing poetry
[12:12] of having those things dead within you
[12:15] in the grave
[12:16] but express it
[12:18] if god has called you to be an
[12:20] evangelist
[12:21] don't go to the grave without
[12:23] evangelizing the lust
[12:26] if god has called you to a purpose in
[12:29] life
[12:31] live to the best of your potential to
[12:34] fulfill that purpose
[12:36] if god has raised you up to be a father
[12:39] be the best father that you can be
[12:42] hold nothing back
[12:44] don't say i leave something when i am
[12:47] gone
[12:48] a good memory
[12:50] do it now while you can
[12:52] if god called you to be a mother be the
[12:54] best mother that you can
[12:56] and don't be afraid to instruct the
[12:58] children that you will offend their
[13:00] feelings
[13:01] you take the greatest of men and the
[13:04] strictest your parents and you'll find
[13:06] when they come into this great office
[13:08] that they hold they always remember a
[13:11] godly mother or father they always
[13:14] remember the counsel of their mother and
[13:16] father
[13:17] as rebellious as children are they are
[13:20] depending on your counsel so you keep
[13:23] counseling them
[13:24] you keep working on them
[13:27] you keep throwing that seed
[13:29] because you don't know when they will
[13:31] need that
[13:33] one day maybe at the lowest point they
[13:35] will sit and think back on what you told
[13:38] them
[13:40] and it could be a thing that turns their
[13:42] lives around
[13:43] so the
[13:44] apostle paul is telling them this
[13:46] persuasion came not of him that calleth
[13:49] you
[13:50] meaning that this one that that's
[13:53] injuring you and causing you not to run
[13:55] well is distracting you from your
[13:57] assignment
[13:58] now if you bring it down to a natural it
[14:01] could be a boy or a girl
[14:03] you know i was thinking about this the
[14:05] other day and i was thinking about life
[14:07] and how
[14:08] we we grow up in life and it's just the
[14:10] norm of things to be done
[14:12] we raise our children
[14:15] at every step of their way
[14:17] from the time they take their first
[14:19] breath
[14:20] right until the time
[14:22] they are old enough to choose their
[14:24] partner the parents are involved in
[14:26] every decision
[14:27] so they've never made serious decisions
[14:29] in their lives
[14:31] and suddenly when they hit their 20s
[14:33] we tell them go and find a partner it's
[14:36] the
[14:36] biggest choice they will make
[14:39] the most important choice they will make
[14:42] and yet it's their first choice
[14:44] they get to make
[14:45] you ever thought of that
[14:47] the most important choice
[14:50] it's one of the first choices we give
[14:52] them
[14:53] does that make sense what i'm saying
[14:56] even when you are trying to help them to
[14:57] study you give them some guidelines
[15:00] but when it comes to the matter of the
[15:02] heart nobody can stop it oh when that
[15:05] bad guy catches the eye of a girl
[15:07] he can turn her life around
[15:09] take her the other direction so what's
[15:11] the choices we make in life
[15:14] because that thing
[15:16] believe me if you mess up in that area
[15:18] if god called you to ministry you can't
[15:20] minister in that office
[15:22] hear me and hear me good
[15:25] if god called you to ministry and you
[15:27] mess up your life
[15:28] god cannot use you in the ministry
[15:31] you may be gifted
[15:33] because gifts and callings are without
[15:34] repentance but if you mess up god cannot
[15:38] use you
[15:39] and if you shall persist
[15:42] and want to do things in the kingdom
[15:43] you'll be doing a god a service without
[15:45] it being his will
[15:47] because god will not work outside of his
[15:49] will
[15:50] let's get back on topic amen
[15:52] when god does things he does things in a
[15:54] peculiar way
[15:56] because here were the children of israel
[15:59] that were down in egypt because of a
[16:01] famine that struck the land and they got
[16:03] comfortable living in egypt because they
[16:07] had the reputation of joseph being this
[16:09] great ruler
[16:11] who had stored up grain and saved egypt
[16:14] so they lived by this reputation
[16:18] and they became comfortable in the land
[16:20] they became comfortable in the land
[16:22] until they grew to be such a mighty
[16:24] nation pharaoh got scared when he looked
[16:27] at them he said these people are so
[16:28] great perhaps if we ever get into a war
[16:31] and the israelites side with the
[16:33] opposing army we will be defeated
[16:36] so let us deal wisely with him and then
[16:38] he starts to oppress them
[16:40] now god allowed moses to be born in the
[16:43] very house of egypt
[16:46] in pharaoh's own household
[16:48] but that did not make moses to be
[16:50] lenient when it came time to deal with
[16:53] them according to god's judgments god
[16:55] may have allowed you to grow up in an
[16:57] environment maybe it's a denominational
[16:59] environment maybe it's a a hindu
[17:02] environment a muslim environment
[17:04] whatever environment that god allowed
[17:07] you to be grown up in god had you there
[17:10] for a purpose
[17:11] amen but when it's time to leave
[17:15] maybe when you spend 40 years in the
[17:17] house of pharaoh
[17:19] you've got to burst forth amen
[17:22] because your pedigree is from another
[17:24] world
[17:25] and when moses realized that he was not
[17:27] pharaoh's sister's cell he left
[17:31] and got the things in a peculiar way
[17:33] because at the age of 40
[17:35] moses was
[17:37] probably a good bulk man he looked like
[17:40] a military leader he looked like he was
[17:42] going to start a revolution he slew this
[17:45] one man it looked like god was going to
[17:47] deliver his people
[17:49] but then he flees into the desert and
[17:52] now he becomes a sheepherder taking care
[17:54] of jethro's cattle finds a woman
[17:58] marries up has children
[18:01] but the children of israel are down in
[18:03] egypt still being oppressed
[18:05] while moses is living his life
[18:08] for 40 years
[18:10] what was needed
[18:12] was his connection with the supernatural
[18:15] amen he was not going to get that
[18:17] connection with the supernatural if he
[18:19] stayed in egypt
[18:21] you will never get your connection with
[18:23] the supernatural if we still cling to
[18:25] denominational ideas
[18:28] please and darkness of man
[18:32] god has got to bring a separation
[18:36] now there's different levels to the
[18:38] anointing
[18:39] you we see this in moses life
[18:42] because
[18:43] in egypt
[18:45] he performed signs wonders miracles
[18:48] but there was still a third pool to come
[18:51] different levels to the anointing
[18:53] we find the children of israel so trap
[18:56] we find them trapped in egypt
[18:58] and the deliverance they were crying out
[19:01] they cried with bitter tears
[19:03] anguish
[19:04] the punishment of their masters was so
[19:07] great upon them they could barely enjoy
[19:09] it
[19:12] that's how some of us feel sometimes in
[19:14] life
[19:15] the cares of life way so heavy upon us
[19:17] that we can not contain this pain
[19:21] we cannot pay it
[19:25] and sometimes we cry out lord take me
[19:27] away
[19:30] that's how the children of israel were
[19:32] down in egypt
[19:34] they couldn't bear this pain
[19:37] and they were crying out for he
[19:38] delivered
[19:40] and there were rumors coming through the
[19:42] town
[19:43] that perhaps moses will return with
[19:45] their mighty army
[19:47] in fact every morning there was a
[19:49] watchman up on the tower
[19:51] looking out for a deliverer
[19:53] because they were promised a delivery
[19:55] would come
[19:57] and 40 years passes by and all hope was
[20:00] gone
[20:02] and god in the midst of this
[20:04] of this
[20:05] slavery in the midst of this pain
[20:08] there were warriors growing up in egypt
[20:11] by the name of joshua
[20:13] and caleb
[20:14] but it was not the appointed time as yet
[20:19] god can raise up sons in the house
[20:22] but wait for the appointed time
[20:24] they waited even though they might have
[20:26] had the ability
[20:28] even though they had the passion
[20:31] but they waited for the deliverer
[20:33] because they understood their ministry
[20:35] they were not the deliverer
[20:37] now it came
[20:39] every morning at sunrise they would run
[20:41] up to the watchtower and look was there
[20:44] an approaching army
[20:45] was there possibility of moses coming
[20:48] with an invading army
[20:49] maybe about
[20:51] midday
[20:52] they would come back down and say
[20:54] there's nobody coming
[20:56] until 40 years passes by but then
[20:59] in the evening
[21:00] time it shall be light
[21:04] departure glory you will surely find
[21:07] somebody decided to go up on the
[21:09] watchtower at evening time and they saw
[21:11] this whole man coming with a stick
[21:14] he meant his brother probably wondering
[21:17] who is this old man because moses had
[21:18] now aged
[21:20] and here was
[21:21] moses coming
[21:23] a one-man invasion
[21:26] to take over egypt
[21:28] now to the children of israel they had
[21:30] no knowledge of what happened to moses
[21:33] they didn't know that he he went up into
[21:36] the mountain
[21:38] and he he saw this pill of fire
[21:40] at this pillar of fire if you know what
[21:43] the pillar of fire is the pillar fire is
[21:45] the angel of the lord
[21:47] if you want to find that out
[21:49] type it out in your message search
[21:51] pillar fire angel of the lord the pillar
[21:54] of fire is the angel of the lord
[21:56] so the angel of the lord comes down and
[21:59] wraps himself around that bush the bush
[22:01] is not consumed moses was assigned for a
[22:05] mission until he met the pillar of fire
[22:09] then he was convinced that he could now
[22:11] go back to egypt
[22:13] even though he had his doubts
[22:15] even though he had his complexes
[22:18] church don't let your complexes and
[22:20] doubts and fears weigh you down and
[22:22] think that you cannot serve in the
[22:23] kingdom of god
[22:25] god will use you in spite of your
[22:26] complexes if you surrender yourself to
[22:29] him
[22:30] we find amen so it came about even in
[22:32] time here's this man marching into egypt
[22:35] he comes in at evening time
[22:38] you see moses was smart he wasn't going
[22:40] to come in the daytime
[22:41] he came in unannounced he came in at
[22:45] sunset
[22:46] on sunset mountain
[22:48] he came with when maybe the egyptian
[22:50] army wasn't even looking out
[22:53] because seven churches that passed by
[22:56] and he had all of them under his control
[23:00] task master after touch master
[23:03] writer after rider had defeated the
[23:06] children of israel he had them so
[23:08] oppressed truly took away
[23:11] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[23:13] christ i was going to go into jesus but
[23:15] i'm tying the two stories together
[23:17] it took away
[23:19] the revelation of the one true god
[23:22] he brought in all kinds of creeds and
[23:23] darkness
[23:25] until now they were so beaten and
[23:27] oppressed
[23:28] titania had set him
[23:30] the dark ages
[23:33] 68 million christians put to death
[23:36] oh
[23:37] god's got
[23:39] judgment waiting for this
[23:41] mother babylon
[23:45] who persecuted the children
[23:47] they were beaten
[23:50] fed to lions
[23:52] saw the sander
[23:53] this gospel is dripping with blood
[23:56] it's tripping with blood this holy ghost
[23:59] gospel he is dripping with blood
[24:02] what was he trying to do he was trying
[24:05] to stop the mission
[24:07] to a broad mission
[24:09] amen but god had given his people an
[24:12] assignment amen
[24:15] amen and their assignment is full
[24:17] redemption
[24:20] their assignment is full restoration
[24:23] their assignment is to receive
[24:25] communication and nourishment from
[24:27] another world
[24:28] revelation 10 is communication from
[24:31] another world
[24:33] the same one that was in the bush
[24:35] the covenant angel
[24:37] was the same one that descended with the
[24:39] open book
[24:41] and he came because seven church ages
[24:44] that passed by and the church one was
[24:46] all but defeated but they needed a word
[24:50] the battle was hot and heavy this was a
[24:53] hot war amen and satan looks like he was
[24:56] winning the war because he had conquered
[24:58] every denominational church
[25:01] there was no church that believed the
[25:03] full gospel
[25:05] even though they called themselves full
[25:07] gospel
[25:08] there was no church on the face of the
[25:10] earth that believed the bible in the
[25:12] original way that paul preached
[25:16] and even though god had sent reformer
[25:18] after reformer
[25:19] he sent out the pentecostal revival
[25:22] the zoo's a street revival the church
[25:25] still managed to denominate so it looked
[25:28] like the assignment that man was given
[25:30] for to to get to revelation 10
[25:33] where those seven founders went out to
[25:35] their voices was going to be foiled by
[25:38] the tactics of the enemy because after
[25:41] every three years
[25:42] that denomination died
[25:44] there was a revival and then he died
[25:47] there was a revival and he died because
[25:49] they denominated around a man
[25:52] around his system
[25:54] but god will stop at nothing to get his
[25:56] people out of egypt
[25:59] amen if it means plague after plague
[26:02] after plague
[26:04] god
[26:04] shook egypt that day
[26:07] 10 plagues rock egypt
[26:09] it was like 10 missiles 10 atomic bombs
[26:13] blasting through egypt
[26:16] until the final one was death until the
[26:19] fourth horse rider was named him and
[26:22] hell follow him
[26:24] if we are living in that time right now
[26:27] where in the age of the fourth horse
[26:29] rider
[26:31] listen what he says hell followed him
[26:35] every demon spirit from that flipped
[26:37] dimension is poured out on the earth
[26:41] so the battle is getting hot and heavy
[26:43] amen there's temptations all around you
[26:47] but this is not a carnal war
[26:50] this is a supernatural war this is a
[26:52] spiritual war and you must be prepared
[26:55] for battle
[26:57] so the church was backed up the church
[27:00] was maybe looking like at a point to
[27:02] email where they needed a timeout from
[27:04] the battle even the prophet after
[27:07] preaching in the first and second pool
[27:09] you remember he said oh lord i messed it
[27:11] up
[27:12] with the shoelaces when talking about
[27:14] the first and second pull
[27:16] he said i've explained it too much to
[27:18] the people
[27:20] and then they rose carnal impersonations
[27:23] trying to type moses with the prophet
[27:25] they followed carnal impersonations like
[27:27] jealous and generous who wanted to
[27:29] impersonate the gift of moses amen so
[27:33] much so that the prophet wants you to
[27:34] leave the ministry but then the lord
[27:36] showed him that if you leave the
[27:38] ministry you'll become like a homeless
[27:40] man and he said i waited i wanted all my
[27:42] life
[27:44] i waited
[27:45] for this message because he had the
[27:47] commission down in 1933 your message
[27:50] will forerun the second coming
[27:53] and all along in the evangelism field
[27:56] under the first and second pull he had
[27:58] no message
[28:00] because all he was doing was tying up
[28:02] the loose ends
[28:04] the things that ludimus the things that
[28:06] wesley missed the things the pentecostal
[28:08] missed but there was promise in
[28:10] revelation 10.
[28:12] when that mighty angel descends amen
[28:15] [Applause]
[28:17] that's what he needed
[28:19] he waited for connection from that other
[28:21] world and when he received connection
[28:23] from that other world
[28:25] watch that seventh trumpet now amen
[28:29] this is not a trumpeting angel
[28:31] but at the voice of that seventh angel
[28:34] when he began to sound
[28:37] mystery after mystery from 63 who is
[28:40] this melchizedek future home of the
[28:43] pride christ is the mystery of god
[28:45] revealed the serpent seed the seed is
[28:48] not here with a shack you take all the
[28:50] titles mystery after mystery was being
[28:54] funded forth knowing amen that it was
[28:56] prophecy for an end time people and
[28:59] that's how you received faith for a
[29:02] rapture the prophet says god brought
[29:04] moses into the world to do the job and
[29:06] god was determined that moses was going
[29:08] to carry out his plan so god gave him a
[29:11] different kind of schooling god gave
[29:13] william branham a different kind of
[29:15] schooling we're giving them schooling
[29:16] from a dead letter and not from the
[29:19] experimental standpoint of the new birth
[29:22] to meet the true and living resurrected
[29:24] lord jesus christ
[29:26] who is just the same tonight as he was
[29:29] in the days gone by moses meeting the
[29:32] angel of the lord in the burning bush he
[29:34] was better equipped in five minutes of
[29:37] talking with god face to face then it
[29:39] was 40 years training under theology
[29:42] look a man is better equipped to preach
[29:44] the gospel and stand before an audience
[29:47] with five minutes experience before
[29:49] almighty god then all the seminaries
[29:52] could etch out in a hundred years of
[29:54] experience that's right there's
[29:56] something happens and sometimes it's
[29:58] ridiculous but god designed it that you
[30:01] would be at this time in this hour to
[30:03] prepare for your body change
[30:06] oh bless the name of jesus amen he's
[30:09] worthy to be praised and adored
[30:11] now that he's got this word and he's
[30:12] blasting out mystery after mystery
[30:15] there's a people who catches that
[30:17] mystery
[30:18] and he says this in the message
[30:21] church order in 63
[30:23] december
[30:25] he says god is looking to me to see that
[30:27] i stay in the word
[30:29] he says and i'm looking to you
[30:32] to see that you carry out the
[30:34] word remember our thought very simple
[30:37] thought our assignment is to finish the
[30:40] mission
[30:41] god is looking to me to see that i stay
[30:43] in the word
[30:44] and he said i am looking to you to see
[30:47] that you carry out the word
[30:49] keep it spiritual for remember
[30:52] all the forces of the dark kingdom of
[30:54] satan will be turned against you as you
[30:57] begin to grow in the lord
[30:59] and you must be soldiers not just fresh
[31:02] recruits
[31:03] your aged soldiers now have been trained
[31:06] to fight
[31:08] and satan will come among you and cause
[31:10] you to dispute with one another if you
[31:13] can
[31:14] turn him down just immediately
[31:17] you're brethren and it's the enemy and
[31:19] we're here to hold the standard in this
[31:22] evening lifetime
[31:24] when the world is darkened and the whole
[31:26] church kingdom is going into the council
[31:29] of churches and pretty soon they'll take
[31:31] a sign to this door closed
[31:35] and then we're going to meet in other
[31:37] places oh praise the lord
[31:40] he doesn't say we can't meet
[31:42] yes he says we'll meet in other places
[31:45] amen amen amen because they'll certainly
[31:48] close these churches one of these days
[31:50] if we don't take the mark of the beast
[31:53] and we're depending on staying true to
[31:55] god till death sets us free
[31:58] and that's what we intend to do
[32:01] do you intend to do that
[32:03] till death sets us free
[32:05] to stay true to the word don't let
[32:07] nothing hinder us
[32:09] our assignment firstly we've got to ask
[32:11] ourselves do we understand the
[32:13] assignment you got to be a trained
[32:15] soldier you know a soji is rugged
[32:17] he can be shot out in the battlefield
[32:20] going to shot with every doubt of the
[32:23] enemy
[32:25] pain things of of this life but he's
[32:28] still persevering to serve the lord
[32:31] shut left in the cold in the battlefield
[32:34] maybe there's nobody else around you
[32:37] but a soldier is trained to pick himself
[32:39] up
[32:40] and to reconnect himself with the rest
[32:43] of the soldiers
[32:44] a soldier is designed for rugged
[32:46] territory for spiritual warfare
[32:49] wickedness in high places the kingdom of
[32:52] god suffereth violence and even though
[32:54] the violence are taking by force seven
[32:57] church ages they took by force until
[32:59] they came up against one called branham
[33:01] who smacked them around amen with under
