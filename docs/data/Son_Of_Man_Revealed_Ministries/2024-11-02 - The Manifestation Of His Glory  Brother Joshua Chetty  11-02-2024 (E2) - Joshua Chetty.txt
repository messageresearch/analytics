TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen praise be to God Amen what a wonderful word amen am the Lord if you're going to look at my notes you think I copied brother you're going to think that we shared notes amen but it's the same holy spirit amen amen hallelujah I don't know why I mean we we are preparing our notes in separate places we don't go to share our notes we don't go to tell each other what we preaching amen wonderful but the same Holy Spirit yes because he is leading the church amen amen praise the Lord we've been blessed this morning amen and we can see the continuation of the word amen and we know that we are we we we thank God we prayed right we sang we prayed so we go straight into the word amen yes amen okay let's see the thoughts that we have this afternoon the same thoughts it's the same God it's the same spirit amen prise the Lord working with the same body amen yes amen it might seem like hilarious to some people but it's the same Spirit yes saying the same body the same thing amen so it's not not a separate Spirit yes which means we all in one mind one body one Spirit come into the unity of the faith and when we come into that oh my then watch the glory of the Lord come down hallelujah amen Satan can't stand then amen amen turn to the Book of Genesis 1:26 amen might seem verbatim but Genesis 126 let's stand and read this amen the thank you brother Jeff that was that was wonderful we could actually close the service by singing and go home amen amen we've been blessed to that amen amen Genesis 1 126 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the kettle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creeped upon the Earth so God created man in his own imageen so watch now the way Adam is created God's image is the same right am in the image of God created he him male and female created is them there's the image of God yeah with the feminist part of God uh femin part of man locked up in man and God blessed them and God said unto them see God is not speaking to Adam alone he's speaking to the to the also speaking to the feminist part of Adam cuz he he said said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth amen you may be seated amen so watch now God is blessing man yes because that's his image but he's saying be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth now God made Man In His Image yes thank you Lord and God had to do a certain part but he also had to have the feminist part unlocked of him to the other parts he cannot be fruitful and multiply if she still locked in him oh yes amen amen hallelujah he only can man can only be fruitful and multiply when that part the feminist part is unlocked out of man and then we go to Genesis 22 1 and the Lord caused God caused a deep sleep to fall onto Adam and he slept amen and he took one of his ribs and cloth up the flesh instead thereof and the rub which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and there shall be one flesh and they were both naked and the man and his wife and we're not ashamed so she was made an help meal for him as we heard in the morning because now when she's taken out of him now they can be fruitful and multiply now Adam can fulfill the god of the earth now Adam cannot proper Dominion because prior to that Adam was looking at everybody being fruitful and multiplying bringing a of his kind but Adam couldn't do that while she was locked in him Christ couldn't fulfill his word while she was locked in him amen God had a great plan amen we come back now to that to that question what is a woman Satan saw the glory of God he he he just wanted to have this Glory because he was right there made a great sherub amen yes right there in the trone room of God but he couldn't have that Glory yes Hallelujah yes but he didn't know yes God's mystery amen amen that locked up in God was the feminist part of him amen the one that is going to share his glory with amen amen but Satan wanted that but Satan couldn't have that because it wasn't revealed to him the mystery that God had amen and then when he said when he saw God man on the earth and now man the son of God another Son of God upon the Earth and God is given instruction to the son you must be fruitful and multiply Satan saw that amen but he couldn't do anything yet because why she was locked up in him but when she comes out of him Satan now says let me pervert this now let me go and Mar the plan of God because why I don't want it because if they be fruitful and multiply in that condition in that perfect condition there's another son and daughter of God upon the Earth they going to have dominion over the Earth but Satan now he was cast out of heaven now he wants to have dominion over this Earth he had a plan to become God of this evil age so he's going to come now and interfere with that plan because remember the time when they reproduce is already after the fall but if they are reproduced by the spoken word before the fall Satan is finished amen Satan cannot have dominion of the earth yes but God allowed all these things to happen in his Tender Mercies now going back to that question what is a woman now Satan from there he saw that the feminist parts of God was locked in man the famish part of of Adam was in sorry the famish part of Adam was locked up in him so he comes and perverts that now and he shows man that you canot be a male and a female is locked up in you but what he didn't realize that's in his perversion now he's trying to say in you is also a feminist part in a man he a famish part or in a woman is also a male part you see how it's perverting men's God's word yes but God had to take the family part out because he had to live out it has to be manifested Eve had to come out of Adam yes it couldn't be together amen when Christ come on the earth he had to do his part but the feminist Parts the body parts he didn't do that he fulfilled his scripture yes he fulfilled all that pertain to his part yes but on Calvary amen when he goes to Calvary Hallelujah out of his Sid comes the church and then Satan tries to M that as well amen but he laid asleep d but in seven Church ages God is forming her he's bringing his Masterpiece right to the center of the end of the seven Church age when he produces this masterpiece amen and then once again amen she will come and fulfill their parts yes amen that's the body part that's the body from Seven Church ages hallelujah amen when Christ was on Earth he was the flesh part amen amen but he comes to Abraham he comes m the theop parts yes and just like that his body amen his body must have a flesh part right yeah manifested right now his flesh must have a theop parts on the sixth Dimension amen and then his body on earth when Christ died what happened on the third day he rose again flesh and theophany comes together in the glorified Parts amen just like that his body will come in the glorified States yes every that Christ did the body must do amen amen if Christ come in the flesh but he also was theophany and flesh and glorified State same like the church right now while there's a flesh body there's also a theop body yes we are here flesh body there's a theop body people on the other side yes Souls that are right now beyond the curtain of time Amen in theop form they still the body of Christ amen yes through seven Church ages that's the theop body that's right there now while is the flesh body right here now amen but all goes together it's one body amen amen all have one body coming all have one headship amen which is Christ amen amen amen we speaking this just a little thought this afternoon the manifestation of his glory amen yes amen glory amen because we have here right now when Jesus was on earth and the son of man and and and the son of man said greater than Solomon is here we have right now greater than Esther is here a greater than root is here amen Esther Was Not Afraid amen Esa Esther was not afraid to approach the king Esther Was Not Afraid in a time where life was at risk and she could go and petition for her people amen she was saved for such a time as that amen Esther went in an intercessory role to claim the life of a people amen root was not ashamed to be associated with boas even even though other had seen hey I'm a young woman this is a old man she was was not afraid because why she knew that he was the kinsman redeemer amen hallelujah amen she was not to be not afraid to be associated with him we're not afraid to be associated with Christ amen we ashame to be associated with his word Jesus said if you love me you will keep my words and my word will not be Grievous to you you will not be ashamed of this gospel you not be ashamed because why it might not be popular it might be might not be good for the people of the world but I'm telling you something this gospel this gospel makes you a son and daughter of God this gospel come to awaken you out of Amnesia he come to give you a real identity amen amen amen Lord he says now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do what two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the heart of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 amen which are Revelations which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals amen it will be these divinely re revealed mystery truth that will literally turn the heart of the children to the Pentecostal fathers and exactly so yes and what does the seventh H come to do take you out of Amnesia amen these Mysteries yes you sing this Myster you sing the iders you sing all these things but the greatest mystery you sing you sing The Mystery of the Brian you sing the mystery of Christ in the bride you sing the glory of God in the bride in his church you see the glory the fullness of God now in his church amen all that was in God he put into Christ all that was in Christ he put into his church this is this is what you are seeing now when the mystery is revealed unto you amen amen you are seeing yourself like how you say you see Christ in every he the principal theme of The Bible then if you see Christ you must see yourself because without without the feminist part Christ is not complete Christ you I and my father are one Christ and I are one yes amen amen prise the Lord what he says in John 149 yet a little while and the world seeth me no more amen but ye see me amen how do we see him the way he reveal himself through his words amen amen how do the two men from EMAs recognized him when he came and break the bread amen break is typ bread is typing the word amen the way I mean he's walking with him the whole afternoon yes but when he started to break the bread amen he started to recognize who who was amongst them and then he left yes did he leave them no he never left them he left them visibly but he was there yes amen so just like that you might be waiting wanting to see God you want to see this Angel materialized before you you want to see the Holy Ghost materialized in Angelic form in front of you but he's in you amen with you and in you amen amen when he's leading you he's guiding you when you are speaking certain things it's not you that speak it it is he that is speaking through you certain time you catch a revelation oh yes it is him that is dropping it down in yes amen certain time you might not be in a mood to pray for somebody you might not be in a religious setup but sometime a prayer of faith is going to heal the sick amen because he is in you amen amen he said I will not leave you nor forsake you I will be with you till the end of the Earth he said yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but y see me because I live y shall live also amen amen this body is alive this body is quickened by the quickening power of Jesus Christ Hallelujah because he yeah amongst us right now waking us up out of amishia making us realize yes the father could produce the sperm mother could produce the egg but and they were they just a body but I am a supernatural being living in the flesh body hallelujah amen I am a son and daughter of God Amen and God now wants to manifest his glory this is the hour of the manifestation of his glory amen amen man and his hour of manifestation yes churches had the hour of manifestation religion had the hour of manifestation there was a time time where people were looking at man looking all sorts of men and how eloquent they are in their preaching how eloquent they are in I'm talking about even in the message now I'm talking about how eloquent they are in their preaching how wonderful they could bring the types and the shadows and the words but this is the time where God must be manifested through his bride this is the hour of the manifestation of his glory amen he must be glorified again through his bride how would he be glorified again through the feminist part of him amen amen she's part of him yes but she's the feminist part now that's the part you had to say I take out of his side that's the Masterpiece right now in his hour that's the Masterpiece that lived out to seven Church ages that come in the final stage where the Capstone to come could come down amen that's that's the people right now who has produced these virtues right till they come to the Capstone because why she's built by character that is why nothing can break her down because she's got character a church without character is powerless but a a church W character is powerful yes amen amen Satan thought he got her as we he about Samson now Satan thought he got her and he got her right down there when the time when the eyes were taken away yes when the prophets of the scene yes but in secret yes oh yes oh Glory in Secrets power was coming the locks were growing in the secrets the prophet was of the scene in The Secret the word is building up the word is building up in this Nazarite woman this consecrated woman this consecrated Body of Christ which is crying out once more Lord hallelujah the Greater Works ready for the Greater Works in the secret the power is coming down in the secret down come his glory down come the sh Glory going to defeat 200 million demons going to defeat every onslaught of the enemy amen the final showdown is here this masterpiece this super church this super race this in Municipal army yes amen amen in Secrets the power has come down Glory Satan thought he got it of the age and they're focusing on History he thought he got her but in secret she's crying out Lord amen there's a secret people crying out Lord oh once more Lord bring back your glory Lord Show Me Your Glory Jesus oh praise be to God Amen and at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you he that at my Commandments and keep them yes he it is that loveed me we're not keeping the word of a man yes you are one with him amen you are coming to his image the more you are receiving of the word you are coming to his image the more you keep his word you are coming to image he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father amen and I will love him and will manifest myself to him amen amen this is the manifestation of his glory amen amen we have received the written word Lord we have receive the revealed word we loved it we love the written word we love the revealed word but it's the hour for the manifested word amen amen amen and he says and Jesus himself said yes if your own law said ye are Gods amateure Gods yes would control of the earth he said if they call those Gods who the word of God came to which was the prophets the word of the Lord comes to the prophet and if you call them Gods how do you condemn me yes he said when I say I'm the Son of God yes and now if the blood of bull and goats could give a power to Moses to God there by the commission of God and stretch forth that rod and say let them come flies he had the word of God and he spoke that word and when he did it become from God's thought a word is a thought expressed and so then when God taught it and put it in Moses mind and he spoke it it became a word and Moses turned around and went back maybe not a fly in the country in an hour from then maybe one old green fly began to buzz around in a half an hour there were 10 lb per square yard what was it it the creative word of God that was spoke by the lips of a mortal man now he's expressing this that this was done back then yes this was done before Calvary yes how much more now and how much more when the title did yes has come back amen because there the lamb had the book in his hand then he comes down as a mighty angel never change ends am same one God and morphine changing the actor amen changing his act now from lamb coming down as a mighty Angel amen he coming now to reveal you to Revelation 10:7 but we see ourselves as Revelation 108 to1 amen when the Thunder cried out you see your names in the book how do you see your names in the book you see your scriptures amen you see yourself being manifested in his hour working out the scriptures that's how you identified with the word when you identify yourself through the scriptures that are you that's how you're able to live in a world of perfect Faith amen amen and when you live in a world of perfect Faith no natural phenomena can defy you yes amen the natural father World cannot defy anything you speak amen glory and then he says there was a creative power God uses many yes God could have used the sun to preach the gospel God could have used the wind to preach the gospel but God chose men to preach the gospel thank you Lord what's the matter with the church today that something there's something wrong my opinion we're not coming with that sincerity to the right thing for that if God could do that by the blood of bull and goats and Bulls that only covered sin and made a propitiation for the sin but but the sin was still there what can he do through the blood of his son yes that omit sin and God has not manufactured but he created a blood that takes away all sin amen amen don't you love that amen your sin is completely taken away amen when he's under the blood what are you talking about you didn't do it in the first place yes didn't the prophet tell you that he said if a brother does something wrong to you and he came brother I'm sorry you'll remember that but when when you go to when you go under the puty under the blood you are justified mean you never done it God doesn't even remember he can't see it anymore prise the Lord so you going every time because the devil is trying to remind you of your Falls and failures In the Flesh and you keep sometimes when you you know when you want to go on the high would you there with God and the devil wants to remind you now he wants to protect your mind comes in a Battleground reminds you of your faults reminds you of your failures you say devil what are you talking about amen I have not done it in the first place Hallelujah and you're not lying because it's omitted there's nothing there's no evidence of it there's no trace of it yes that's what it means amen and Mark 11 11:2 but he's talking to about 23 here right amen whatever you say to this mountain move and don't doubt in your heart but believe that you said will come to pass you can have what you said where's the Pentecostal church at today amen you don't realize that confess truly confession or Med yes it builds a bridge across this Chasm it takes man back in the presence amen of his creator and makes him a Son of God amen amen amen so everybody in the people want to become Christian just want to be a church goer or want to just say I I Believe In Christ I'm a church goer but no God wants to take us back out of all this Amnesia that we had through the world Amen to show us that you a son and daughter of God yes that you are part of me yes that that the gene the soul that you have is a god Soul amen he not there's a God Gene in there amen amen it cannot be separated from God it always was a part of God Amen you stepped out of Eternity to comeing Hallelujah you stepped out of Eternity in the back part of God's mind you always were there you always was with him but you stepped out of Eternity to come into time into a time element amen into a time zone and you stepped into time but we are going back with him amen you don't realize that confess confess sorry he says he that believeth on me and the works that I do shall he do also and there you are vely I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said glory to God it's my God revealing himself in humility prise the Lord amen hallelujah we living the hour of the thir pool amen yes amen he said why cry speak and now not everybody can just speak yes firstly you got to identify that you're a Son of God yes you got to identify that you're the body of Christ upon the Earth you got to identify that you're the feminist part of Christ doing the parts that he did and you got to recognize that now you have authority to speak yes because Esther he said speak now even off of the Kingdom you can have it she couldn't just do it before that amen but now when she put a royal apparal on when she come and recognize who she is amen and she recognize The Authority that she has she could speak she could even write her own decree amen amen so when you come to that stage you realize now you can speak amen can I water the king amen hallelujah praise the Lord praise be to God amen amen so now you have the authority behind you you can speak speak to your situation speak to your circumstances amen you know you are privileged people we don't realize what we got Amen on Friday I was there at my dad's place and they had some visitors there and I wasn't really in a mood to speak to anybody I said no don't introduce me to your Vis my mom said no no I must introduce you so they came there they need some prayer and help and I started to speak a few words and you know sometime when you speak the Holy Spirit can discern people's hearts and he knows the needs so I just had to speak a few words I don't know what it infiltrated them but I could see the reaction the continence people you are so privileged to receive the word that you receive you know people are dying yes yes for truth you think that all the people in the church world don't want to hear the truth no the leaders have deceived them yes right and they've now led into a delusion and they there's such spiritual famine that they will eat out of the garbage can because they spiritually they will die otherwise they know they spiritually dead they and they starving so they will eat anything so when you give a trip to them they appreciate it the little nuggets that you have to share they're not going toat anywhere else yes no other denominational preacher going to tell him the things that you're going to tell him yes no one is no one else is walking in Revelation like you amen am no one else is carrying the anointing like you yes yes amen you might not be how should I say attractive to look upon to be looked upon you might not have the alent words you might not have the right manner of speech or the powerful speech vibr speech but you're carrying an anointed praise the Lord and when you open your mouth as a Son of God yes as a daughter of God as the feminist part of Christ amen when you open your mouth the anointing that comes from you from within you it breaks the Yoke of bondage you go speak to people that are in bondage right now watch them break down in tears watch them break down in tears because why Satan's got them bounds but the demon powers that's holding them in bondage can recognize yes this is not normal people this sounds familiar amen this happened in the days of the Apostles because remember demons are the same Spirits demons don't die they live through all the ages same Spirits these this we heard this in the days of Jesus we heard this in the days of the Apostles we heard this in the days of will random but now we're finding a many membered body oh my God they're causing a rampage upon the Earth they're causing chaos upon the Earth amen yes amen they bombing one after the other they're throwing bombs one after the other they're not giving her the chance they're causing her genocide that's what they're going to say yes that's what these demons are going to say there 200 million am that's what's going to happen when this bride now has awakened to her realization because she recognized God in the hour that she's living in yes that's what we're calling people that's what this message is doing now I want a message of this hour am God is being unrecognized in this hour because God is in his bride now yes God is working through his body now amen so once again God the presence of God is being unrecognized but I am saying thank God we have recognized amen amen now the presence of God God is recognized here amongst us but we pray that God will not be unrecognized that he will be recognized throughout the message world so there can be a shaking time yes and give Shake Satan's kingdom a defeating amen amen hallelujah it must be a shaking time yes amen forgive me my voice is G I was drinking ice water from but there must be a shaking time and Awakening
