[7:30] 28
[7:32] minutes 28 February but one day with the
[7:36] Lord thousand years so you have to be
[7:47] careful Revelation 10 verse one very
[7:51] familiar portion of scripture
[7:53] amen and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[7:56] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[7:58] and a rain rainbow was upon his head and
[8:00] his face were as with the sun and his
[8:02] feet as pills of fire and he had in his
[8:04] hand a little book open and he set his
[8:06] foot upon the sea and his left foot upon
[8:08] the Earth and he cried with a loud voice
[8:10] as when a lion wrote when he had cried
[8:12] seven Thunders utter their voices amen
[8:14] when the seven Thunders had uted their
[8:16] voices I was about to write and I Heard
[8:18] a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal
[8:20] up those things which the seven tunders
[8:22] uttered and write them not and the angel
[8:24] which I saw stand upon the sea and upon
[8:26] the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven
[8:28] and swear by him that live forever and
[8:29] ever who created the Heaven and the
[8:31] things that therein are and the earth
[8:33] and the things that therein are and the
[8:34] Sea and the things which are therein and
[8:37] there should be time no longer but in
[8:39] the days of the voice of the seventh
[8:41] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[8:43] mystery of God should be finished as he
[8:45] had declared it to his servants the
[8:47] prophets Matthew 11:25 while you're
[8:50] turning to it we be all the pastors that
[8:52] are here this evening amen amen praise
[8:55] the
[8:56] Lord Matthew 11:25 says at that time
[8:59] time Jesus answered and said I thank
[9:01] thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth
[9:03] because thou has hid these things from
[9:05] the wise and The Prudent and has reveal
[9:07] them unto tonight Lord bless reading of
[9:10] his word you may take your seats while
[9:13] we offer a word of prayer father we
[9:14] thank you once again for the reading of
[9:16] thy precious word we pray God that you
[9:19] would come and Inspire us and Speak Lord
[9:21] God the things that we need to know and
[9:23] understand Lord because the bride must
[9:25] know and recognize her day and her
[9:27] message Lord we bless your hly
[9:29] name of the service unto thee now in
[9:32] Jesus precious name ask much
[9:34] Thanksgiving amen amen amen we're going
[9:37] to just uh speak on the attraction this
[9:40] evening amen and as quick as I can uh go
[9:42] through some uh notes that I put
[9:45] down uh I want to say that the
[9:48] difference between the
[9:49] denominations and the meage church is
[9:52] Revelation chapter 10 Hallelujah that's
[9:55] what makes the difference Revelation 10
[9:57] is the open book revelation 10 uh 10
[10:00] makes the uh the opening of the
[10:02] revelation of Seven Seals makes the
[10:03] Bible a brand new book Revelation
[10:06] chapter 10 separates the wheat and the
[10:08] 10 amen and I believe it's the wheat
[10:11] that is gathered around the celebration
[10:13] of one place on Sun
[10:16] Mountain now if there's anything that we
[10:18] must say brothers and sisters we must
[10:20] bring it back to the scripture amen and
[10:22] the Bible is the absolute the Bible like
[10:26] says the Bible is God in print form amen
[10:29] and that's why in Revelation says you
[10:31] cannot add to this Bible you cannot take
[10:33] out from the Bible because it's God in
[10:35] PR form god is perfect this word is
[10:38] perfect amen there's no mistakes in the
[10:40] Bible there's no mistakes in our message
[10:42] either and so we want to just Fellowship
[10:45] a little bit around it tonight but says
[10:47] if there is a scriptural sign Hallelujah
[10:50] then you must identify the scripture for
[10:52] that sign if there is a sign and if it's
[10:55] a scriptural sign then you identify the
[10:57] scripture for that sign amen for example
[11:00] like uh the sign of the cloud if the
[11:02] cloud is a scriptural sign then we must
[11:05] identify which scripture is being
[11:07] fulfilled by the just like Jesus was
[11:11] born to Mary who Mary said I'm a virgin
[11:14] that know no man and those that heard
[11:17] her testimony said no she had an affair
[11:20] with the soldier and all of those things
[11:22] they they couldn't understand that this
[11:24] woman could bring forth a a child hallu
[11:27] being a virgin but then those that would
[11:30] took the time yes those that would have
[11:32] taken the time to said okay if this lady
[11:36] if what she's saying is true yes that
[11:38] she being a virgin has brought for a
[11:40] child let's see if there's a scripture
[11:42] to justify what she saying hallelujah
[11:46] and if they had gone back to the
[11:47] scripture they would have come to Isaiah
[11:49] 7:14 and they would be able to tie up
[11:52] the scripture for the
[11:54] sign so any Scripture sign we must
[11:58] identify the
[11:59] the cloud that we are speaking about
[12:02] that we are rejoicing about is not
[12:04] something new amen it is in the Bible
[12:06] all the way from the Old Testament to
[12:08] the New Testament the children of Israel
[12:11] had the P of Fire by night they had a p
[12:13] of cloud by the day there were so many
[12:16] instances where the cloud appeared
[12:18] throughout the Bible Elijah one time he
[12:21] sent his servant to look towards the sea
[12:24] and uh the Bible say at the seventh
[12:27] watch the seventh time he went and he
[12:29] looked towards the sea he saw a cloud
[12:32] rising up brother the man says over
[12:34] there in the west a cloud was rising up
[12:37] amen Moses built a tabernacle and the
[12:40] cloud overshadowed the Tabernacle the
[12:43] same with the temple the cloud
[12:45] overshadow the temple yes amen the cloud
[12:47] brother man says the cloud is a sign of
[12:50] the condescension of God Amen Hallelujah
[12:54] brother also says in another quote the
[12:56] cloud is a sign of the coming of the
[12:59] Lord yes amen so every time you seen the
[13:01] cloud in the Bible it was showing that
[13:03] Christ of God was coming down amen
[13:06] hallelujah now I want to start by taking
[13:08] a type tonight in the in the a type uh
[13:12] of Moses receiving the Ten Commandments
[13:14] yes and we know the Commandments is the
[13:16] word of God Amen and in other words
[13:19] Moses was receiving the word of God for
[13:21] his day because the word come to the
[13:23] prophets amen and we know Jesus was the
[13:26] word he was the word made flesh and and
[13:29] um Jesus himself when he come on Earth
[13:31] he introduced himself first to the
[13:33] prophet yes John the Baptist so the word
[13:35] always comes to the prophet amen now
[13:38] Moses here his asks of the Lord in the
[13:41] book of Exodus he says I want you to
[13:43] ascend up unto the mountain for the
[13:46] receiving of the word for your day amen
[13:49] hallelujah remember he was going to
[13:50] receive the Ten Commandments yes which
[13:52] for Moses and Israel was the Revelation
[13:55] 10 for them yes and so we read in Exodus
[13:58] 24 from 13 to 16 you can read it at home
[14:02] the Bible says the glory of the Lord was
[14:05] upon that
[14:07] mountain not only that there but the
[14:09] scripture is specific it says the glory
[14:12] of the Lord abod on the mountain for six
[14:15] days that mean for 6 days the cloud was
[14:19] on the mountain and then the Bible says
[14:22] on the seventh day amen then God called
[14:26] out to Moses from the midst of the
[14:29] not from Heaven somewhere not from the
[14:31] earth somewhere not from other parts of
[14:33] the mountain from the midst of the cloud
[14:36] God called out to Moses he says come up
[14:39] into the mountain and come into the
[14:41] cloud on the seventh day yes mean six
[14:44] days in the boat on the mountain but on
[14:46] the seventh day Moses goes into the
[14:49] cloud and what God done is God began to
[14:52] reveal his mind to Moses what was in the
[14:55] back parts of God's mind was revealed to
[14:58] Moses
[14:59] and Moses come down and began to express
[15:02] those things those hidden mysteries
[15:04] which was his Revelation 10 in time yes
[15:07] amen you love the Lord the Tabernacle
[15:10] the feast and all of those things all
[15:12] was revealed to Moses that was their
[15:14] message for the day yes amen you love
[15:18] the Lord amen now you notice like I said
[15:21] Moses went up on the mountain on the
[15:22] seventh day the cloud hung over there
[15:25] for a just keep keep note of my words
[15:28] the the Cloud hung on the mountain for
[15:30] about a week yes yes absolutely so for
[15:34] about a week the cloud hung on that
[15:36] mountain our Prophet messenger you know
[15:39] is caught up in the cloud and he's
[15:42] caught up in the cloud on Sunset
[15:44] Mountain yes notice it's a seven Church
[15:46] age it's also a type of the seventh day
[15:50] and this Prophet is caught up into the
[15:52] cloud the glory of the Lord shined upon
[15:55] Moses when he went into that cloud yes
[15:58] amen
[15:59] and brother man says it's a special
[16:01] adoption robe amen and the special
[16:04] adoption robe what it identifies is that
[16:07] this is my beloved Son he him me the
[16:11] word of the Lord is in this Propet to
[16:13] give out to the people yes so Moses the
[16:17] clouds on the mountain six days he goes
[16:19] up on the seven days cut up into the
[16:21] cloud Moses is shining with the glory of
[16:24] the Lord Moses has a special adoption
[16:26] robe he has the word in him to give out
[16:28] to the people Amen Hallelujah Jesus
[16:31] Christ had the same experience amen he
[16:33] had a special adoption rope the prophet
[16:35] says Mount Transfiguration you can read
[16:38] the book of Matthew it gives an account
[16:40] and Matthew says after six days yes
[16:44] means that Jesus is gone onto
[16:45] Transfiguration on the seventh day
[16:48] Hallelujah notice here that Jesus Took
[16:50] Peter James and John oh yes up unto the
[16:53] mountain Moses also took Witnesses yes
[16:56] and Peter James and John up into the
[16:58] mountain he was transfigured before them
[17:01] they were caught up into that cloud and
[17:04] the face of Jesus and his rign was
[17:06] shining with the glory of the Lord so
[17:10] exact same thing on the seventh day into
[17:13] the cloud the glory of the Lord is
[17:15] shining Upon Jesus a special adoption
[17:18] roote this is my beloved Son he he him
[17:22] hallelujah amen love the Lord praise the
[17:25] Lord God's word was in Moses mes to give
[17:29] to the people God's word was in Christ
[17:31] to give to the people yeah he him amen
[17:35] praise the Lord when you read Matthew's
[17:36] account Matthew says after 6 days yes
[17:39] Jesus went onto Transfiguration means on
[17:42] the seventh day when you read the book
[17:44] of Mark The Book of Mark says after six
[17:47] days means on the seventh day Jesus goes
[17:50] into the cloud on the mountain yes Moses
[17:53] in the cloud on the mountain on the
[17:55] seventh day also and in know their face
[17:59] was shining like the sun yes but when
[18:01] you read the account in the Book of Luke
[18:04] Luke says about 8 days so one Moses was
[18:09] seven Matthew says seven and uh Mark
[18:12] says seven but Luke says eight days and
[18:16] Luke says the exact same things that the
[18:19] other have said only the day changes yes
[18:23] from 7 to 8 and you think that oh is a
[18:26] contradiction in the Bible but no
[18:28] contradiction amen you cannot add you
[18:30] cannot take out why because it's a
[18:32] perfect book Hallelujah why it's God in
[18:35] print form if it's a contradiction then
[18:37] there's an error with God God's not
[18:39] perfect yeah amen we'll see just now
[18:41] Lord give us Grace so the reignment his
[18:43] reignment was shining and his face was
[18:45] shining the glory of the Lord was upon
[18:47] Christ as he entered into the mountain
[18:50] now look at Elijah on Mount K the
[18:53] prophet the Bible says a fire came down
[18:55] and consumed the sacrifice a tub of
[18:57] calvary
[18:58] and straight up there Elijah prophesies
[19:01] rain but the rain does not come at the
[19:03] exact same time yes and then Elijah
[19:06] sends says to his servant go and look
[19:09] into the sea and see if you can if you
[19:11] can find a sign of rain amen what was
[19:14] Elijah looking for a cloud because the
[19:17] cloud must bring rain every time the
[19:20] cloud appears it must come with rain
[19:22] amen we have a cloud that has come say
[19:25] the cloud that has come is bring a
[19:26] latter rain not only L rain but a f in a
[19:29] latter rain has come with this Cloud yes
[19:33] so yeah the servant goes out and he's
[19:36] looking for a sign of rain he does not
[19:38] see a cloud yes he goes the first time
[19:40] the second time the third six but the
[19:43] Bible says on the seventh time in the
[19:47] seventh watch he goes and looked into
[19:49] the sea and he says he saw a cloud
[19:52] rising up in the says in the
[19:56] west you love the Lord amen let me read
[19:59] you a quick quote there speak to the
[20:01] Rock and it shall give forth its
[20:03] water he said how foolish they carel
[20:06] Minds well if that's the best you can
[20:08] give me just let it alone like Elijah
[20:11] one day when he went to pray and he sent
[20:13] his servant up to see if there was any
[20:15] sign of a cloud and he went the seventh
[20:17] time and when he come back he said oh
[20:20] yes there's a little Cloud about the
[20:21] size of a man's hand hand over in the
[20:24] west over
[20:27] there now this is a prophet of God yes
[20:30] he's not mixing his words he knows
[20:32] exactly what he's pointing to amen a
[20:35] cloud in the west over there amen love
[20:38] the Lord amen so now you look at you
[20:41] look at a prophet now our Prophet
[20:43] William branam he had also had a mount
[20:46] SII experience he had a mount
[20:49] Transfiguration experience and if you

[25:28] understand this quotation it's just
[25:29] glaring at you amen amen now the
[25:31] supernatural Cloud appeared on Mount
[25:33] sunset on the 28th of February
[25:36] 1963 yes the picture was taken and it
[25:39] proved to be Supernatural and of course
[25:42] there are those who say that it was
[25:44] caused by rocket smoke to disprove the
[25:48] message yes
[25:50] amen now there was a report done by Dr
[25:54] James McDonald yeah James McDonald is an
[25:57] expert expert in cloud formation and
[26:00] atmosphere yes amen and uh after he had
[26:04] studied the picture and uh he had done
[26:07] his own uh research James McDonald came
[26:10] back and said that was not rocket smoke
[26:13] amen absolutely brother bam didn't even
[26:15] know that the cloud actually appeared on
[26:18] the 28th of February yeah SS took the
[26:21] picture yes brother man even says he
[26:23] says they took the picture not us but
[26:27] that picture Pro our message if Bram
[26:30] took the picture then we can say we
[26:32] manufactured the picture but the problem
[26:35] says they took the picture but the
[26:37] picture Prov our message and so their
[26:40] own scientist their own cloud expert
[26:43] James McDonald said that was not rocket
[26:46] sloke yes and he said there was no water
[26:49] vapor at that height to form a natural
[26:52] Cloud yes he said it had to be
[26:54] Supernatural amen hallelujah they said
[26:58] it they said it
[26:59] amen if it was a rocket smoke how did it
[27:04] form a cloud horizontal yes do we have
[27:07] the picture
[27:08] brother amen a rocket flies vertical
[27:12] yeah this picture is formed
[27:15] horizontal so that that rocket had a
[27:17] malfunction it has to fly horizontal
[27:20] across the landscape but rockets fly
[27:22] straight up but this cloud is formed if
[27:26] you see how it's formed it's formed the
[27:27] horizontal yeah so this picture is in
[27:30] the horizontal if it was a rocket smoke
[27:33] then the rocket smoke must produce this
[27:35] picture the other way but it was
[27:37] produced in a horizontal just because
[27:40] God knew that they were going to point
[27:42] it to Rocket smoke amen and then the
[27:45] Lord said to the prophet now turn the
[27:50] picture then we have that picture
[27:52] hanging on our wall that was not in a
[27:55] vertical position yes but was far was
[27:58] form in a horizontal and God said turn
[28:00] it amen because if God put it like that
[28:03] then they'll say it was rocket St that
[28:04] done that Hallelujah you love the Lord
[28:07] amen
[28:08] amen praise the Lord so the Lord said to
[28:10] Prophet turn the picture the picture was
[28:13] taken in flag stop some 4 hours away
[28:16] driving distance from California if it
[28:18] was rocket smoke how did it keep its
[28:20] shape all the way for 4 hours yes amen
[28:24] clouds cannot do that amen keep a form
[28:27] for 4 hours Journey yes James McDonald
[28:31] also added this into his notes and uh
[28:36] you can tell me why he says there was
[28:38] iridescent in the cloud if you know what
[28:42] iridescent is it's the colors of the
[28:45] rainbow Hallelujah they took the
[28:48] picture they said there was a rainbow in
[28:51] the cloud but it proved our scripture
[28:54] and it proves our message hallah oh yes
[28:57] roet smoke does not put a rainbow in a
[29:00] cloud
[29:01] amen you love the Lord James mcdonal
[29:05] said there was iridescent in the cloud
[29:08] means that the colors of the rainbow was
[29:09] in amen This Cloud thank you Lord
[29:12] according to our Prophet whose word we
[29:14] take it was the Fulfillment of
[29:17] Revelation 10 verse 1-7 the coming down
[29:20] of a mighty Angel and John said I saw
[29:23] another Mighty angel coming down from
[29:26] heaven go with a cloud and a rainbow
[29:29] upon his
[29:30] [Applause]
[29:31] head thank you Dr James McDonald
[29:37] amen the rainbow in the clown says the
[29:40] Covenant Angel and who else can it be
[29:42] but Christ himself rainbow God G made a
[29:45] covenant with Noah and what was the
[29:48] Covenant with Noah I put a bow bow in
[29:50] the rainbow I put a bow in the cloud I
[29:53] put a rainbow in the cloud if you read
[29:55] Genesis Genesis 8 verse 5 it says after
[29:59] the rain was over and finished the
[30:01] waters began to decrease upon the Earth
[30:04] it says and the Caps of the mountain
[30:06] became visible on the 10th day of the
[30:09] first month amen not a coincidence
[30:12] praise the Lord that when the Caps of
[30:14] the mountain are visible the capstones
[30:16] of the mountain are visible on the 10th
[30:19] day of the first month Revelation chap
[30:21] 101 the Capstone is visible in Genesis 8
[30:25] verse5 yes you love the Lord amen
[30:28] because we had a Capstone that come down
[30:31] Revelation
[30:32] 101 God commands uh Genesis 8:14 the
[30:37] Bible says that the Lord said to uh Noah
[30:40] on which was the Bible say the 27th day
[30:43] of the second month
[30:46] yes yeah on the 10th day of the first
[30:49] month the Caps are being shown yes then
[30:51] in Genesis 8:14 the Lord says to Noah on
[30:54] the 27th day of the second man he says
[30:57] to Noah the Earth is dry the land is dry
[31:00] empty out the AR and offer a sacrifice
[31:03] unto the Lord on the 27 day of the
[31:06] second month yes
[31:08] amen I don't know how long it took him
[31:10] to empty the ark and offer a sacrifice
[31:13] but you you see the chapter changes
[31:14] chapter n the Lord says to Noah and his
[31:16] family be fruitful multiply and
[31:19] replenish the Earth the only thing we
[31:21] know is the 27 of the 2 God says empty
[31:24] the ark offer sacrifice and the next
[31:27] thing the Bible is telling us the Lord
[31:29] is saying to Noah be fruitful multiply
[31:31] replenish the Earth in other words
[31:34] between the 27th of the second month to
[31:37] the start of chapter n the Lord is
[31:39] saying to Noah I want you to go and
[31:43] bring forth life upon the Earth in other
[31:46] words it's a time of life when after the
[31:50] 27 of the second
[31:52] month now you can read between the lines
[31:55] we are message believers they come to
[31:57] Abraham and Sarah and he said that Sarah
[32:00] will have a child amen and I will visit
[32:02] you according to the time of life and
[32:04] says what is the time of life every 28
[32:07] days a woman goes to a cycle and that is
[32:10] a time of
[32:12] lifej so if it was the 2 27th of the
[32:15] second month and he emptied the AR and
[32:18] in chapter N9 he says go be fruitful
[32:20] multiply and replenish the earth I am
[32:22] saying it was the 28th of the second mon
[32:26] it was the time of life for Noah that
[32:29] come back on Earth amen you love the
[32:32] Lord
[32:34] yes let me just skip here quickly praise
[32:36] the Lord so on the 28 of the second
[32:40] month which is Genesis 9 it is a time of
[32:43] life for Noah and we are saying it's a
[32:45] Trin of the second month and the Lord in
[32:47] this chapter is saying now Noah I'm
[32:49] going to establish my Covenant with you
[32:52] I'm going to put a cloud with a bow
[32:55] inside of it Hallelujah yeah amen it
[32:58] says a bow in a cloud yes it's both
[33:01] singular Yes means one cloud with one
[33:04] bow in the cloud read the scripture
[33:06] you'll see brother and sisters
[33:08] amen time of life amen 28th of the 2
[33:11] month God's making a covenant because
[33:14] it's a covenant Angel it's the same one
[33:17] that came today at the same time 28th of
[33:20] February 28 of the 2 month yes you love
[33:23] the
[33:24] Lord science took the picture up it
[33:27] Yeah in our day brother says they took
[33:30] the picture not us says it is our Lord
[33:33] up there the rising of the Sun the quote
[33:35] is there points to the picture he says
[33:37] it is our Lord up then hallelujah it
[33:40] hung there for 28 minutes almost half an
[33:43] hour amen it's I mean f Revelation
[33:47] chapter 8 but I'm going to skip but
[33:48] here's the thing that I want to bring
[33:49] out tonight quickly the thing that
[33:52] causes doubt for so many and they say
[33:55] brother mam is a false prophet
[33:57] and they they tell us that the
[33:59] cloud um that was formed there oh they
[34:02] tell us that the the the cloud they
[34:04] speak about the cloud being formed and
[34:05] the rockets SW all of those things but
[34:07] the prophet made it clear that those
[34:09] were the wings of seven angels amen
[34:11] hallelujah there was no Cloud that
[34:13] produced that but the wings of seven
[34:15] angels amen and a prophet told us that
[34:18] he was caught up into the cloud of this
[34:21] Angels many of them left the message
[34:24] because they said brother manam was not
[34:25] there on the 28 of February yes you love
[34:29] the Lord am yes sir now you know brother
[34:33] Ram was actually not there on the 28 of
[34:34] February
[34:36] yes and um the prophet was meant to go
[34:40] javalina hunting javalina javalina Park
[34:44] and uh but the season only started on
[34:46] the 1st of March yes and so the 28 of Fe
[34:49] when the cloud appeared but the manam
[34:51] could not be on the mountain yes because
[34:53] if he went there he would have broke
[34:54] hunting laws yes and the prophet's
[34:56] daughter Rebecca said she said that
[34:57] Daddy did not break any hunting rules he
[35:00] obeyed all the rules means that Daddy
[35:02] the prophet William Bam could not be on
[35:03] the mountain on the 28th of February
[35:06] because hunting season started on the
[35:07] 1st of March yes for those that hear the
[35:11] prophet speak about him being caught up
[35:13] into this constellation of angels they
[35:15] say okay if the prophet was caught up
[35:18] then he should have been there on the
[35:19] 28th but according to what we know he
[35:21] was not there on the 28th and then they
[35:24] say okay he's a false prophet
[35:27] a brother Bam's own account brother B
[35:30] remember brother bham tells us about his
[35:32] experience with seven angels amen that's
[35:35] what he is according to us in his own
[35:38] account brother man tells us that he was
[35:40] not there on the 28th of
[35:42] February and uh he tells and he gives us
[35:45] the reason why he could not have been
[35:47] there
[35:49] amen now the problem himself was meant
[35:52] to go hunting on the 1 of March but he
[35:55] receives a call from a certain mother
[35:57] and saying that her son was going to be
[35:59] executed by electric chair and that she
[36:02] needed him to come and offer his
[36:04] assistance speak to the judge speak to
[36:06] somebody the son might live and brother
[36:09] says he loved hunting so much but he
[36:12] could not allow himself to turn down a
[36:15] mother that was crying for a son amen
[36:18] and so the prophet said he made his way
[36:20] to Hon
[36:21] Texas now what God is actually doing
[36:24] he's taking his servant further and
[36:26] father away from this Cloud that
[36:28] appeared on 28th of February yes yes
[36:31] amen but it's a purpose yes God doesn't
[36:35] do anything just for nothing and the
[36:37] prophets are led by God and so brother
[36:41] Adam was not there on the 20th of
[36:43] February he was nowhere near the cloud
[36:46] on the 28th of February when those
[36:49] angels
[36:50] appeared brother baram did not even know
[36:53] the Angels appeared and the picture was
[36:55] taken on 28th February until he read the
[36:58] article in the paper then he got to know
[37:00] there was a May edition then he got to
[37:02] know that there was a picture taken of
[37:05] the cloud on Mount Sunset
[37:09] amen you love the Lord amen praise the
[37:12] Lord so God is taking his Prophet away
[37:15] from the event but the BAM his own
[37:17] testimony is telling us that he was not
[37:20] there now according to my own
[37:24] understanding I'm going to show the
[37:25] unfolding of this in here in the book
[37:26] called A
[37:31] absolute a absolute and the other day
[37:34] when I had some
[37:36] arrangements said and the other day when
[37:39] I had arrangements made for something
[37:42] else there was hunting yes uh another
[37:46] place and I knew that those children
[37:47] were facing death yeah I thought if
[37:50] something would happen to those children
[37:52] I would never forgive myself of not
[37:55] coming here to give my opinion and doing
[37:57] all that I could to help this mother and
[37:59] father and his children and to do all
[38:01] that I could for the saving of their
[38:03] lives yes that's
[38:05] 63034 the 4th of March this is amen he
[38:09] says he had there something he wanted to
[38:10] do yes the other day but he couldn't go
[38:13] and do it because of the mother and his
[38:15] children so he went away parag 117 and
[38:19] my faith that I have in God and that's
[38:21] why I'm here tonight fourth of March
[38:25] that's why I can out something else and
[38:28] we got in yeah what did he cancel out
[38:32] his hunting
[38:33] trip he's in Houston on the 4th of March
[38:37] preaching an evening service and it
[38:40] takes from our calculation plus minus 20
[38:43] hours of driving from Houston to
[38:45] California mean that he would have left
[38:48] uh on the fth to flag stop and when
[38:50] hunting on the 6th of March is my
[38:54] opinion means preaching on the fall
[38:57] on the 5th of March he's driving 20
[38:59] hours back and on the 6th of March in
[39:01] the morning the prophet goes hunting for
[39:07] javalina and if he went hunting for
[39:09] javalina on the sixth means that on the
[39:11] seventh of March brother bam would have
[39:14] had the cloud the angel experience amen
[39:18] hallelujah take a deep breath brother
[39:20] and
[39:20] sisters the cloud appeared on Mount saai
[39:24] and hung there for how many days six
[39:26] days six days the Bible says and the
[39:29] seven days Moses was called up into the
[39:32] CL yeah the prophet the the Angels
[39:35] appear on the mountain brother bam is
[39:37] gone to Houston but brother is coming
[39:40] back to the mountain he's coming back
[39:42] for hunting in my opinion on the seventh
[39:44] day brother bam goes and has an
[39:47] experience with this Angels amen
[39:50] hallelujah perseverance 63802 paragraph
[39:54] 15 he said how many ever how many ever
[39:57] heard the tape sir what time is it just
[40:00] before I went out west the reason the
[40:01] angel of the Lord sent me out there he
[40:03] told me now coming from the heavens will
[40:05] be seven angels in a consolation yes
[40:07] there will be three on the one side and
[40:09] one on the top it'll be like a triangle
[40:11] or something like a pyramid I said the
[40:13] one on the right had his wings turned
[40:15] back and I swept right into the
[40:17] consolation by him and he was to tell me
[40:20] what to do Hallelujah and I went
[40:22] Westward just as he told me was up there
[40:25] on the very same day and when they
[40:28] started coming from Heaven I said there
[40:29] will be a sound of a great blast
[40:31] something like a break of an airplane a
[40:33] sound breaker going for it'll be so much
[40:35] louder than that and it'll be just be
[40:37] Northeast of TUC Tucson about 50 or 100
[40:40] miles something like that and tuon will
[40:43] be setting this way and I'll be picking
[40:45] some kind of cockers or goat heads they
[40:48] call them call them there off my trous
[40:51] trouser legs and I said a blast will go
[40:53] off and we were up there at that day and
[40:56] I was over to myself there is a man I
[40:59] think brother Suman is here tonight was
[41:01] with me and brother Norman are you here

[41:18] about our children and what must do and

[45:17] cannot go under 28 days he can't go on

[47:26] the book of Exodus when the Bible says
[47:28] the the cloud appeared on the mountain
[47:31] and on the mountain for 6 days and
[47:34] on the seventh day waiting for him Moses
[47:37] goes into the cloud yeah the the Gom and
[47:40] says brother says that the Angels waited

[47:59] Y he says I just wanted to drop this
[48:01] standing uh starting the service he says
[48:04] about a week and then he corrects
[48:07] himself 10 days
[48:10] ago he's preaching the breach on the
[48:15] 17th yes is that right yes he's
[48:19] preaching the breach on the 17th he's
[48:21] talking about something that happened 10
[48:23] days ago yes what date will that be yes
[48:27] amen praise the Lord I think we do match
[48:30] means it on the seventh 10 days ago
[48:33] means that on the seventh something
[48:36] happened amen you love the Lord say I
[48:39] was Disturbed I just I I wouldn't take
[48:42] service or anything because I don't know
[48:43] it seemed like it could have been
[48:44] something that was bad I didn't know
[48:46] what it was you see B keeps relating and
[48:48] he's speaking about the the sorden hand
[48:50] and he's speaking about sunset Mountain
[48:52] but he's very specific he says about a
[48:54] week and then he corrects himself 10
[48:57] days ago means on the 7th of March yes
[49:01] something
[49:02] happened Prophet was caught up in a
[49:04] cloud of seven
[49:06] angels Prophet speaks about his
[49:08] encounter with the cloud and seven
[49:10] angels 10 days ago something happened
[49:12] means on the 7th of March brother bam
[49:14] was on that
[49:18] mountain let just skip
[49:20] here now remember Moses the seventh day
[49:24] Matthew said s day Mark said seven day
[49:28] brother bam is on the seventh day but
[49:31] Luke said was the eighth day amen you
[49:35] love the Lord yes
[49:37] amen can you put up that that numbers
[49:40] Brothers I just want to show
[49:43] something everybody can tell the story
[49:45] their own way
[49:48] yes you see after six
[49:52] days in March is which day if you could
[49:55] help me
[49:56] seven the seven day so in other words
[49:59] for Moses six days the cloud is in the
[50:03] the the clouds on the mountain on the
[50:05] seventh day Moses goes up Matthew says
[50:08] after 6 days so if you say after six
[50:10] days of March means that he went on the
[50:12] seventh day yes and then Mark said after
[50:15] six days after six days of March means
[50:17] he went on the seventh day but Luke says
[50:20] on the eth day yes but depends where
[50:22] you're counting from amen if you're
[50:24] counting from the 28 or February sunset
[50:27] Mountain then the seventh day becomes
[50:29] your eth day amen hallelujah so those
[50:32] that are saying after 6 days means what
[50:34] they're saying is after six days in
[50:37] March on the seventh day he was taken
[50:39] into a cloud but those that are looking
[50:42] back to Sunset Mountain they're saying
[50:44] on the eth day amen hallelujah is taken
[50:48] into whether it's the eth day or whether
[50:51] it's the seven after six days it's
[50:53] actually the same day same day they all
[50:55] are accounting for that this Prophet
[50:58] went up into Hallelujah the mountain you
[51:01] love the Lord let me leave you there
[51:03] there's lot to say but we want to listen
[51:06] toen prise the Lord
[51:11] hallelujah amen
