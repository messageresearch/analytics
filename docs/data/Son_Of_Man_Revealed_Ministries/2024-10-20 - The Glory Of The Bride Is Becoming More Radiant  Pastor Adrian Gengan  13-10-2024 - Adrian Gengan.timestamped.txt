[5:00] things amen but I'd like to speak on the
[5:03] glory of the Bride is becoming more
[5:05] radiant hallah amen the glory of the
[5:08] Bride is becoming more radiant amen and
[5:11] what we were finding out amen even as we
[5:13] spoke on Wednesday Shak glory is veiled
[5:16] in you now yes there there's no denying
[5:19] it the veil has been taken off we don't
[5:22] speak in mystery anymore this is a time
[5:25] of manifestation amen amen at one time
[5:27] it was locked up in Hidden Mysteries but
[5:29] the prophet revealed those Mysteries and
[5:31] he left it to us to
[5:33] manifest so the glory of the Bride is
[5:35] becoming more radiant we'll start off
[5:37] there in Psalm
[5:39] 48:2 Psalm
[5:43] 48:2 praise the Lord amen it says great
[5:48] is the Lord and greatly to be praised
[5:51] amen
[5:53] amen if we have a great God we need a
[5:57] great Praise In the City of of our God
[6:00] now I want you to know I'm talking about
[6:02] the Bride of Jesus Christ here in the
[6:04] city of our God in the mountain of his
[6:07] Holiness beautiful for situation the joy
[6:11] of the whole earth who's the joy is
[6:15] Mount Zion that's the Lamb's wife on the
[6:18] sides of the north so she's she's
[6:22] positioned
[6:23] strategically amen amen she's positioned
[6:27] on the sides of the north am man
[6:31] Hallelujah the city of the great king
[6:34] now who is the great king Psalm 24 says
[6:36] who is the king of glory amen amen he
[6:39] said God is known in our palaces for a
[6:42] refuge God is known in our palaces amen
[6:45] amen there's no room in our hearts that
[6:47] we have not unlocked to him amen so we
[6:51] our thought there was to get to the
[6:52] sides of the north to show you the
[6:53] bride's position strategically in
[6:55] Heavenly places then Isaiah 14 and13 we
[6:59] just want read that one point and notice
[7:01] how it is there in the 13th verse praise
[7:04] the
[7:05] Lord this we know Deception comes in the
[7:08] beast in the 13th chapter of Revelation
[7:10] it says for thou has said I will Ascend
[7:12] into heaven right the bride is in
[7:15] Heavenly places now I will exalt my
[7:17] throne above the stars of
[7:20] God I will sit also upon the Mount of
[7:23] the congregation in the sides of the
[7:26] north if you go do a search on that word
[7:28] sit it means to marry
[7:31] so like how he took Adam's wife he wants
[7:34] to make a move on this queen he says I
[7:37] will sit upon the Mount of the
[7:40] congregation in the sides of the north
[7:42] amen the Lord had blessings to his
[7:44] reading of his word you may be
[7:46] seated amen praise the
[7:49] Lord so it's good to be fun in the house
[7:51] of the Lord amen and we had a wonderful
[7:54] time in the prayer meeting amen the all
[7:57] night prayer meeting and uh we had
[7:59] different pastors come through amen and
[8:02] they give tremendous testimonies amen of
[8:06] unity and the corridor being protected
[8:10] Hallelujah the Brotherly Love
[8:11] Philadelphia Corridor amen
[8:14] hallelujah and uh so we also have amen
[8:18] one testimony already out of that
[8:20] meeting and you know Sister Christina
[8:23] put up the prayer request on uh was it
[8:26] Wednesday you put it up or Thursday you
[8:28] put it Thursday
[8:30] and sister sodi was taken to
[8:32] hospital and you know she's been
[8:34] struggling with sugar diabetes and eye
[8:36] blood pressure and these things when it
[8:39] reaches a point you know when you get a
[8:41] a wound or a sore those things don't
[8:44] heal so she was taken to hospital amen
[8:48] and uh so brother subashan was away so
[8:51] Sister Christine asked the church to
[8:53] pray amen and then on Thursday evening I
[8:56] went to visit her at the hospital and uh
[9:01] she was very fearful you could see she
[9:02] was crying you know when she saw me she
[9:04] started to weep and cry and tell me what
[9:06] did Sin did she do in her life you know
[9:08] to deserve all of this but it was just
[9:09] out of the emotions amen so I waited for
[9:12] brother space and sister to leave and
[9:14] then I sat down there and I started to
[9:15] speak to her and I started to tell her
[9:18] that you need to have your faith in the
[9:19] word of God Amen there's no situation
[9:23] that's impossible I told of how God
[9:25] Jesus made a man's hand was withed to
[9:28] come forth
[9:29] and how he he healed the blinded eyes
[9:32] and he gave sight to the blind again
[9:34] amen and the healed the crippled and the
[9:38] lame amen and all manner of diseases so
[9:40] started to build a faith a bit amen and
[9:43] then uh made her confess things amen
[9:46] because we don't realize the power of
[9:49] our confession that we carry the
[9:51] authority on the earth spoken word must
[9:53] be restored to the bride amen we showed
[9:56] you amen how Adam lost his Dominion Adam
[9:59] had Dominion on the Earth but he lost
[10:01] his Dominion because he lost spoken word
[10:04] and when he lost spoken word he lost
[10:05] Fellowship because God can only
[10:06] fellowship with the word amen amen so he
[10:09] lost those three things Dominion he lost
[10:11] spoken word and he lost Fellowship
[10:13] praise the Lord so God to confess I
[10:17] reject anxiety I reject fear I reject
[10:20] stress I reject depression I reject any
[10:23] symptom you got to give Satan legal
[10:25] notice am because we carry the legal
[10:28] Authority but it's important for the
[10:30] person to confess it because that demon
[10:33] power is attached to that person
[10:35] illegally so that person has got a give
[10:37] it eviction notice amen so once that was
[10:40] done took it through the scripture amen
[10:41] 1 Peter 2:24 start to show how it was
[10:44] already taken care on the cross of
[10:46] Calvary and she's already healed amen so
[10:47] you can see her faith level was already
[10:49] increasing when I left there amen and
[10:51] then I told her we having the prayer
[10:52] meeting we're going to pray for you and
[10:54] then we came into the prayer meeting and
[10:55] that was one of our prayer points Amen
[10:58] to pray for sisteri
[10:59] and uh Hallelujah pray over that that
[11:03] sickness and that sore because so what
[11:05] happened was they left the form with it
[11:07] and they were going to amputate the leg
[11:09] they needed a sign because you know once
[11:11] it reaches a certain point it turns gang
[11:14] greine and I don't know what not I don't
[11:16] know the thing but they were going to
[11:17] amputate up until here
[11:21] okay so it was a serious thing so the
[11:24] brothers prayed all the brothers that
[11:26] were here know we prayed about it so we
[11:28] can't give you of War secrets that
[11:30] happens within the army so we'll just
[11:32] give you brief testimonies amen
[11:35] hallelujah so the Army don't discuss
[11:37] secret things that happen
[11:39] in in the Army but the civilian life can
[11:43] enjoy the victories of the army amen So
[11:46] Yesterday amen after we got home and
[11:49] Tred to get some rest only could get two
[11:51] hours rest but your body is not used to
[11:53] being sleeping in the day so only get
[11:54] like 2 hours rest and then we were back
[11:56] up amen but something is telling me
[11:59] phone
[12:02] sisteri phone sisteri now I've been
[12:04] learning how to deal with this voice
[12:07] that I hear you got to learn how to work
[12:09] with the spirit amen because sometimes
[12:11] you ignore it anything it's just me my
[12:13] conscience or something telling me so I
[12:15] said let me phone but the number she
[12:17] gave me the number off her head but I
[12:19] think she gave me the digits different
[12:20] we saw phone brother sub and he was
[12:22] still traveling back and then he gave me
[12:24] the right number then I found her and I
[12:26] said sister SOI you know we prayed for
[12:28] you what is your current situation she
[12:31] says well I'm still in hospital right
[12:33] now and if any of you want to go and
[12:35] visit her she's not there anymore just
[12:37] so you
[12:39] know she's been discharged amen praise
[12:42] the Lord so she's telling me and I
[12:43] couldn't hear the signal was cutting and
[12:45] I was getting frustrated you know when
[12:46] you can't hear something I was getting a
[12:48] bit frustrated so the car got cut and I
[12:50] found her back and then she moved to a
[12:51] place where I think you could hear
[12:54] better and then she says well the doctor
[12:56] came to examine me this
[12:57] morning and he looked at this wound and
[13:01] he said well there's no more need to
[13:03] amputate praise the Lord praise the Lord
[13:06] praise the Lord hallelujah and he says
[13:09] they are discharging me today oh thank
[13:12] you Jesus now I know I spoke to brother
[13:13] suban and he didn't tell me any of this
[13:15] thing so our pH brother subashan back
[13:17] and I said do you know your mother's
[13:18] being discharged today and he didn't
[13:19] even know anything but that's the power
[13:22] of
[13:23] God amen hallelujah thank you Jesus so
[13:26] all it's required is faith huj fa in the
[13:29] finished work amen nothing we do now
[13:32] manufacture but faith in the finished
[13:34] work of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah how
[13:38] is brother Duncan
[13:40] doing he's he doing much better okay
[13:43] amen so I know that there the Lord has
[13:45] already done a work of healing there
[13:47] amen they wouldn't just distur you know
[13:49] he had heart attack and sister Maggie
[13:51] was saying how his heart was damaged on
[13:53] the front and the back that's was your
[13:55] words you told me amen then we started
[13:57] to pray I believe sister VI he also
[13:59] prayed over him at the hospital and
[14:00] things and so on Monday I believe Monday
[14:03] was he discharged Tuesday he got
[14:06] discharged and they gave him an
[14:07] appointment for next year is it next
[14:09] year now they don't do things like that
[14:12] if it's serious now it seems like it's
[14:15] hard to get proper
[14:16] testimonies but we'll take it if they
[14:19] don't want to come forth and testify
[14:21] what the Lord is doing amen it's fine
[14:23] but we know the victory is already
[14:26] won so I believe this you know there
[14:28] were so many prayers request that were
[14:29] coming we even got international prayer
[14:31] requests coming through and we were
[14:32] praying for these things lot of people
[14:34] crying out for the baptism of the Holy
[14:35] Ghost and you know all different areas
[14:37] of their lives amen so I believe those
[14:39] testimonies are going to come pouring
[14:41] through amen so we we we read here now
[14:46] so sorry I just remembered now I'm
[14:48] looking at the date and I realized it's
[14:51] Mom and it would been Pastor Ron's
[14:52] anniversary today am I
[14:55] right today is the
[14:57] 13th yep you don't even know your
[14:59] anniversary M but it will be in what 51
[15:03] 51 amen so we pray that the Lord will be
[15:05] with you amen so you know there's a I
[15:08] want to give you this quote
[15:11] because the prophet gave this quote and
[15:13] he talks about When a Man Loves a Woman
[15:16] and she really loves him and he really
[15:17] loves her he says they'll step into
[15:20] eternity together so your anniversary
[15:22] will not be forgotten it's an eternal
[15:24] Union amen so praise the Lord may the
[15:26] Lord bless you amen Hallelujah so we
[15:30] looking at these two scriptures I just
[15:32] want to remind you what we read Mount
[15:34] Zion is on the sides of the north the
[15:36] bright strategic position if you want to
[15:38] know in the spiritual realm where you
[15:40] are seated you are seated on the sides
[15:42] of the North in the kingdom of God
[15:45] therefore you find Satan having a desire
[15:47] to come to the sides of the north and
[15:48] sit upon the Mount of the
[15:50] congregation he wants to invade this
[15:53] Army so there is an invading Army coming
[15:55] under the fourth seal we know that amen
[15:58] to kill with sword famine and beast of
[16:00] the
[16:01] earth and we know that the rider on the
[16:03] horse is called death and Hell Followed
[16:06] him praise the
[16:08] Lord but God will not be defeated and I
[16:11] want to read Joel chapter 2 now let's
[16:14] read Joel chapter 2 from verse
[16:20] 19 yeah the Lord will answer say unto
[16:23] his people behold I will send you corn
[16:29] wine and oil meaning the famine is
[16:33] over the famine for the bride is
[16:36] over if you're going to get corn which
[16:38] means you already possessed the land you
[16:40] planted and you are now going to eat of
[16:42] the
[16:44] land praise the Lord so he's sending
[16:47] corn wine and oil and you shall be
[16:50] satisfied there with and I will no more
[16:53] make you a reproach among the ethen but
[16:56] I will remove far off from you the
[16:58] Northern Army oh there's that that Army
[17:02] is coming to the north but the Lord is
[17:04] saying I will remove the northern army
[17:06] that army that has come to sit upon the
[17:10] congregation I am going to remove that
[17:13] Army I will remove the northern Army and
[17:17] will drive them into a land
[17:20] Barren praise the Lord and desolate with
[17:23] his face towards the east sea amen amen
[17:27] so Satan is going to run into barness
[17:30] his army is going to run into baroness
[17:32] yes yes hallelujah how are they fruitful
[17:35] when they possess your body that's right
[17:38] but you're going to drive them out and
[17:39] drive them to barness amen we got to
[17:41] keep reading amen and is hind the part
[17:44] toward the uttermost sea and his stink
[17:47] shall come up and Ill Savor shall come
[17:49] up because he had done great things
[17:53] praise the Lord fear not Oh Land be glad

[18:04] pastures of the Wilderness do
[18:07] spring for the tree beareth of fruit and

[20:41] the holiest of holies hallelujah amen
[20:44] praise the Lord and nobody could get
[20:46] behind there but the priest the high
[20:48] priest amen and they experien a sh of
[20:51] Glory but God did away with that first
[20:53] temple the veil was torn amen there at
[20:56] Calvary then we know there kind of glor
[20:58] Glory was in Jesus
[21:00] Christ amen but now the kind of Glory
[21:04] has moved be
[21:07] skin be your skin yes amen the Bible
[21:11] declares there in in the book of Gideon
[21:14] and in one translation it says that God
[21:17] veiled himself with
[21:20] Gideon God veiled himself with
[21:23] Gideon amen and you know the prophet
[21:26] would say that God veiled himself in
[21:27] Moses and God veiled himself to the
[21:29] prophets and God veiled himself in Jesus
[21:32] Christ they couldn't see past the human
[21:35] Veil he
[21:36] says
[21:38] hallelujah and then so he began to
[21:40] clothe himself with Gideon he began to
[21:43] that's how the power of God Came Upon
[21:44] them he began to clothe himself he
[21:48] clothed himself with William brandom
[21:50] Luke
[21:51] 17:30 a son of man revealing the son of
[21:55] man that the people couldn't recognize
[21:57] and differentiate between the ministry
[21:59] they asked him are you Jesus Christ why
[22:02] he clothed
[22:03] himself amen praise the
[22:06] Lord amen and you know Revelation 10
[22:09] says he clothed himself with a
[22:12] cloud those seven angels became israil
[22:15] yes and they brought the Revelation he
[22:17] says night after night those angels met
[22:20] me in the room and they gave me the
[22:22] revelation of that Seven
[22:24] Seals praise the
[22:27] Lord so so he was unveiling himself the
[22:30] mystery so I'm showing you now that he's
[22:33] now clothing himself with you
[22:36] amen oh but that's hard to believe but
[22:39] if you understand Christ The Mystery of
[22:41] God revealed the second full mystery
[22:43] purpose is to have full expression
[22:45] through his people then you've got to
[22:47] believe that he has clothed himself with
[22:49] you you carry the sh of Glory within you
[22:52] but that's the Revelation Satan will
[22:54] deceive you to say it can't be so but
[22:57] you got to take the word to the mind and
[22:59] defeat him in the mind and tell him it
[23:01] is so it is in the word amenallah
[23:05] so right now the Shan glory is in your
[23:08] Tabernacle in each one of you sh glory
[23:12] is emanating from within you the glory
[23:14] of the Lord in the body of Christ you
[23:16] become the dwelling place of the most
[23:18] high Psalm 46:5 says God is in the midst
[23:22] of her
[23:24] amen as we learn to submit to the Holy
[23:27] Spirit we learn obedience through
[23:29] suffering amen through our experiences
[23:32] we are healing ourselves through the
[23:33] spirit We are Becoming hungry and crying
[23:36] out in
[23:37] desperation now you can read Colossians
[23:40] 1: 26- 28 there it it says that and you
[23:44] know this is a scripture the prophet
[23:45] took to preach Christ is a
[23:47] mystery amen and he's talking about a
[23:51] Divine mystery in that chapter and he's
[23:53] talking about a a a secret that's been
[23:55] concealed from before the foundation of
[23:57] the world
[23:58] and he's saying it's now being
[24:01] revealed and unfolded and manifested in
[24:04] every believer's
[24:06] life amen that Christ is now living
[24:09] within you and he floods your soul with
[24:11] joy he floods your soul with expectation
[24:13] of
[24:15] glory amen the mystery of Christ has
[24:17] become embedded within us if anyone
[24:20] wants to know the mystery of Christ amen
[24:22] that mystery is now embedded in the
[24:24] bride amen
[24:26] hallelujah amen allow me to dramatize
[24:29] this for a moment amen yeah right now
[24:32] all seven Church age Messengers with the
[24:34] groups of people are gathered there
[24:35] beyond the curtain of timeall amen and I
[24:38] want you to know the book that Adam lost
[24:40] his authority his legal rights over the
[24:42] Earth that book was taken back to the
[24:45] original
[24:46] owner amen amen I want you to know that
[24:50] that book has come back on the earth
[24:52] that's what Revelation 10 is describing
[24:55] because in Revelation 5 the lamb takes
[24:57] the book from the orig owner and then he
[24:59] starts to break those seals and in
[25:02] Revelation 10 he's bringing back man's
[25:05] legal authority to the Earth he's
[25:06] bringing back a Dominion he's bringing
[25:09] back the title deed to the
[25:11] Earthen hallelujah praise the Lord how
[25:14] many of you know something else went
[25:16] back to the original
[25:17] owner brother Bram says it this way when
[25:20] Jesus Christ's blood was shed on Calvary
[25:22] your sin was taken away and it went back
[25:25] to the original
[25:27] owner am whatever sin Satan dumped on
[25:31] you it went back to the original owner
[25:33] meaning you are sinless you are spotless
[25:36] you are The Virtuous Bride of the Lord
[25:37] Jesus Christ amen thank you Lord thank
[25:40] you
[25:42] amen sin came from him so it must go
[25:45] back to him praise the Lord amen so
[25:48] we're finding here that the book has
[25:50] come back to the original
[25:52] owner and if you read Revelation 10
[25:55] there is a group of people represented
[25:57] by John who have the book now we can
[26:01] detail the book and tell you that in the
[26:02] book has names
[26:04] amen the lamp section of the book of
[26:07] life as the spiritual Gene of God all
[26:09] the names written down so if a people
[26:13] now have taken that book and they have
[26:14] eaten that book they asked to prophesy
[26:17] again meaning they asked to call those
[26:19] names in the book amen that's what your
[26:22] prophecy is doing calling those names in
[26:24] the book your prophecy amen is just not
[26:27] a a normal prophetic word like the
[26:28] denominational world but your preaching
[26:30] is to germinate the C genene of God
[26:33] within the heart of
[26:36] man so allow me to dramatize this amen
[26:39] here what happened six Church ages had
[26:41] passed and you find amen that church age
[26:43] Messengers are gathered there beyond the
[26:45] curtain of time and here comes brother
[26:47] brandham and he he lays out his message
[26:49] but in 1965 the Lord takes him home and
[26:52] there's a welcoming party for him
[26:55] there amen amen all the same Saints are
[26:58] rejoicing to see him they know that this
[27:01] man was the seventh angel and they know
[27:04] that this man was on the earth at the
[27:06] time amen of the coming of Revelation 10
[27:10] to bring the title deed back on the
[27:11] earth praise the Lord so all of them
[27:14] excited amen Paul amen can you imagine
[27:17] when Paul got there to that Dimension

[28:01] understanding amen sir amen so on and on
[28:05] can you imagine when irenius came and
[28:08] Martin and Columba and all of them came
[28:11] they into that Dimension when I'm
[28:13] talking about when their lives were
[28:14] finished on the earth and they had
[28:15] passed over to the other side each one
[28:17] Paul must have been asking irenius do

[28:51] mystery and they asked him they all come
[28:53] running brother Brandon do you have the
[28:55] book

[29:48] Ghost amen yes Lord thank you praise the
[29:53] Lord but people don't like the Holy
[29:54] Ghost praise the Lord amen
[29:59] I want you to know when the prophet saw
[30:00] the bride he saw a preview of the bride
[30:03] and he first he saw the Glorious church
[30:04] then he saw the deceived Church come up
[30:06] but then amen hallelujah it says I saw
[30:09] the group come up again dressed exactly
[30:12] like the first group amen
[30:15] hallelujah praise the
[30:17] Lord and Ephesians 5 says he is
[30:20] presenting the church to himself a
[30:21] glorious Church Without spot without
[30:24] blemish without
[30:25] wrinkle amen so Through Time we find
[30:28] that God was unfolding his Redemption
[30:30] plan Hallelujah and that was Kept Secret
[30:33] in the back part of God's mind and he
[30:35] did not reveal it to anyone at any time
[30:38] but he unfolded it by making his plan
[30:40] come to pass I'm paraphrasing a lot of
[30:42] Christ The Mystery of God is revealed
[30:44] you can read it for yourself but when
[30:45] our lord Jesus came as Redeemer he was
[30:48] unfolding God's Plan of Redemption God
[30:51] was fully being expressed through Jesus
[30:53] Christ as Redeemer as Savior as healer
[30:58] praise the Lord thank you Lord and Jesus
[31:00] bear our sin on the cross you can put up
[31:02] 1 Peter 2:24 there amen it was a Divine
[31:06] exchange I've tell you I've seen more
[31:08] miracles and healings using this one
[31:12] scripture because it contains in it the
[31:14] old Plan of Salvation it says here who
[31:17] in his own self bear our sins in his own
[31:21] body on the tree that we being dead to
[31:23] sins should live unto
[31:26] righteousness I don't every one he if
[31:28] you are in Jesus Christ I don't every
[31:30] one hear you saying you're a sinner Hall
[31:33] you don't have sin amen the blood of
[31:35] Jesus Christ completely annihilated
[31:38] sin thank you it's a Divine exchange you
[31:41] are dead to sin that's why I didn't like
[31:44] it there brother s when they kept coming
[31:46] they spoke more about you prior your
[31:48] conversion at your
[31:52] birthday but Brother s is born again
[31:54] thank you he passed sins are forgotten
[31:58] but you see that's what Satan will do
[32:00] they'll remind you of your past but why
[32:02] didn't we concentrate this man since
[32:04] he's been changed since he's been born
[32:06] again he's been a rugged soldier in the
[32:08] field of Christ winning many souls to
[32:10] Christ he's a Fearless warrior in the
[32:12] Kingdom amen
[32:14] yes should live unto
[32:17] righteousness by whose Stripes you were
[32:21] healed amen it's a finished work yes
[32:24] this scripture here cripples the enemy
[32:26] because it's pack with tr
[32:28] so when you present this scripture to a
[32:30] sick person to a person Bound by sin
[32:33] chains break am
[32:37] amen you say why don't you quote Isaiah
[32:40] 53 Isaiah 53 is I love Isaiah 53 brother
[32:43] brandom says you can personalize it he
[32:45] was wounded from my transgression but
[32:48] remember that is prophecy speaking about
[32:50] someone to
[32:51] come yes
[32:53] sir I just like this scripture by whose
[32:57] Stripes you were were
[32:58] healed finished work complete short 1
[33:03] Peter
[33:06] 2:24
[33:08] amen by whose Stripes you were healed
[33:11] finished work so at no other time he the
[33:15] statement now I don't think you got it
[33:16] when I said it the last time throughout
[33:18] all of history of man in no other time
[33:22] was the full word of God revealed to any
[33:24] other age
[33:28] the fullness of the word was only
[33:30] revealed through the seventh Angel's
[33:32] message yes he had the word to Quicken
[33:36] your SE Gene within you and to for the
[33:39] Holy Ghost to birth you to life and now
[33:42] that we know the Holy Ghost is bringing
[33:43] Sons to adoption sons that can handle
[33:46] the father's
[33:48] business amen and I want us to really
[33:51] understand that God has not called us
[33:53] here to church religionallah that's
[33:55] right if you follow the story of
[33:57] adoption when the son is adopted he the
[34:00] purpose of adoption is for the son to
[34:03] handle the father's
[34:04] business amen and Jesus had just attend
[34:08] age of 12 he told Mary don't you know I
[34:11] must be about my father's business I'm
[34:13] asking you whose business are you
[34:15] concerning yourself with amen we should
[34:18] be concerned about the father's business
[34:20] than you Lord so if we are saying we are
[34:22] coming into adoption and we are reaching
[34:25] adoption we must he doesn't call us to
[34:28] adoption for us to remain quiet we must
[34:30] take
[34:32] control of dominion and
[34:35] principalities and powers and rulers of
[34:38] Darkness he says the Kingdom of Heaven
[34:41] suffered
[34:42] violence and must now go and take it
[34:45] back sons who come into adoption they
[34:48] must handle the father's business he
[34:50] says they can speak like the father they
[34:52] can sign like the father who they fire
[34:55] is fired and who they hire is hired
[34:58] whatever you bind on Earth is bound in
[35:00] heaven whatever you loose on Earth is
[35:02] loose in Heaven Come on spiritual Sons
[35:04] and Daughters of God awaken to your full
[35:07] potential we are living beneath our
[35:09] privileges because Satan is keeping us
[35:11] deceived to think that Those portions
[35:13] are not opened up to us I say it's
[35:15] opened up to us amen every promise is
[35:18] open up unto us amen we are thinking
[35:21] that there's a further work of
[35:22] redemption to bring us when Jesus Christ
[35:25] died on the cross I'll show you just now
[35:26] brother Bron says everything that Adam
[35:28] lost is restored to the
[35:30] church but it's Satan's job to deceive
[35:33] you it's Satan's job to make you
[35:35] concerned with the cares of this life
[35:37] it's Satan's job to make you
[35:40] busy praise the Lord so I'm saying if
[35:43] you're a Son of God if you're a daughter
[35:45] of God you must now engage in the
[35:47] father's
[35:48] business you may be unemployed here in
[35:50] the natural life in the father's Kingdom
[35:52] there is no unemployment amen yes there
[35:56] is zero unemployment in the father his
[35:58] kingdom praise the Lord
[36:01] amen and there is also no pay because
[36:06] you have full access to the Royal Grant
[36:08] if you have full access to the Royal
[36:10] Grant why would you require a salary you
[36:12] can just go and take as much as you
[36:15] need amen amen in the father's Kingdom
[36:20] there's no Medical Aid because he's got
[36:22] Miracle
[36:23] Aid amen there's no insurance policy
[36:26] because he's given us
[36:28] Assurance hallelujah amen benefits are
[36:32] out of this world amen hallelujah amen
[36:36] glory be to his name amen so I want you
[36:39] to know that the fullness of the word
[36:40] has been revealed to us and do we
[36:42] realize that we as the Bride of Jesus
[36:44] Christ are the only people on the face
[36:46] of the Earth that are believing the
[36:48] entire word
[36:53] am if you don't believe that go
[36:54] Fellowship somewhere else in your
[36:55] denomination
[36:58] the only people on the face of the Earth
[37:00] that believe the entirety of the word
[37:02] amen is the people
[37:04] called by the message of the hour under
[37:07] Malachi 4:5 and 6 and Revelation
[37:09] 10:7 amen why so that gives a bright
[37:13] special quality amen it makes her
[37:16] believe it because she's a c Gene of God

[37:21] of the word and it's going to give a
[37:23] perfect faith rapturing faith amen
[37:25] praise the Lord amen let's let's move on
[37:28] Amen praise the
[37:31] Lord if we can read 2 Corinthians
[37:33] chapter
[37:41] 3 we were talking about this Veil and
[37:45] here the Apostle Paul is talking about
[37:46] it he says whenever the Old Testament
[37:48] was
[37:49] read but even we'll read from verse 16
[37:53] or 15 let's read 15 but even unto this
[37:56] day when Moses is read talking about the
[37:58] Old Testament books there the veil is
[38:01] upon their heart nevertheless when it
[38:03] shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be
[38:06] taken
[38:07] away okay now the Lord is that spirit
[38:12] and where the spirit of the Lord is
[38:14] there is Liberty amen yes but we all
[38:20] with open face beholding as in a glass
[38:23] the glory of the Lord you know what he's
[38:26] saying when you are looking at yourself
[38:29] in the mirror you must see the glory of
[38:32] God yes the glory of God when you look
[38:35] into the word you see yourself he's
[38:39] saying that when we are looking the
[38:41] glass he's talking about like a
[38:43] mirror when we look with open face
[38:45] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[38:48] Lord are changed into the same
[38:52] image
[38:54] amen so whose image are we beholding
[38:57] amen Christ has come to Plain View
[39:00] Hallelujah we are looking at the word
[39:02] and what he saying canot paraphrase it
[39:05] and say he's saying We are Becoming like
[39:07] Jesus that what we are looking at We are
[39:09] Becoming like
[39:12] him I changed into the same image from
[39:15] glory to glory as even as by the spirit
[39:19] of the Lord amen now who you would bear
[39:21] record with me and say that the glory is
[39:23] becoming more expressed in me amen that
[39:26] what started out in the beginning of the
[39:27] year as a as a thought in infancy is now
[39:30] coming into a full grown image and
[39:32] stature of a perfect man amen that soon
[39:35] this body can continue amen and you are
[39:38] in your Enoch walk now you are in your
[39:40] perfect walk now come on things of God
[39:42] must be believe by faith you are in your
[39:45] Enoch walk now as Enoch built a physical
[39:48] pyramid there you are building a pyramid
[39:50] City within yourself hallah you are
[39:53] building faith virtue knowledge
[39:54] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[39:56] kindness and charity has come to cap you
[39:59] off you are building a pyramid City God
[40:02] is building a pyramid City within you
[40:05] and one of these days the atoms of these
[40:07] bodies can't hold you down because of
[40:09] the word that you carry amen this
[40:12] elements of this world can't contain the
[40:14] God man within you that you will burst
[40:16] forth from these
[40:17] atoms
[40:19] than now if you would say that you are
[40:22] depending on
[40:23] God how many of you are depending on God
[40:27] nobody is depending on God here how many
[40:29] of you are depending on
[40:32] God we depend on him for daily
[40:35] things but if I told you God is
[40:37] depending on you as well what would you
[40:39] say what the god of the
[40:42] universe the great Creator would depend
[40:45] on me let's go to that first quote and
[40:48] see that you become an integral part of
[40:51] redemption's plan amen I want you to
[40:54] also be very observant and notice that
[40:56] angels were asked to hold back the
[40:59] winds from
[41:01] blowing right that winds wind means SWS
[41:03] and strife but can you see some winds
[41:07] coming through which means if those
[41:09] angels are loosening those grips and
[41:12] some of those winds are starting to come
[41:13] through the bride can't be on the earth
[41:16] at that
[41:18] time he doesn't work with the Jew and
[41:20] the Gentile at the same
[41:22] time so meaning they will require
[41:24] Angelic assistance
[41:27] like how Joshua got Angelic assistance
[41:29] the captain of the host came
[41:32] down praise the Lord so one of two
[41:35] things will happen here if God is going
[41:37] to give an extended period of
[41:41] Grace then Trump will be
[41:46] president I'm saying extended period of
[41:48] Grace for the
[41:49] Gentiles because he will back them up
[41:53] but if
[41:54] not then I'm saying you better check if
[41:56] your lamp is stmed and
[41:59] burning if not because there's no way
[42:03] you can see all nations of the Earth are
[42:04] going to turn against the right even now
[42:08] you heard that they struck a military
[42:10] Point amen and I believe it was UN
[42:12] Mission going there so now they even
[42:13] more up in
[42:15] arms praise the Lord so soon they will
[42:19] turn and you know that's prophecy the
[42:21] prophet prophesied that once that the
[42:24] they signed that agreement the money
[42:26] proposition
[42:28] right then you know they break the
[42:31] Covenant praise the Lord so I'm saying
[42:34] we are living in crucial hours right now
[42:36] if youve ever heard about a Rapture
[42:38] spoken about a Rapture body change and
[42:40] God coming back this is what we are
[42:41] talking about amen maybe you were asleep
[42:44] all these years but get
[42:47] ready get ready so God is depending on
[42:51] you as a member of his body to bear
[42:55] fruit of his spirit
[42:58] and now if he's depending on you let's
[43:00] open up our channels and let the Holy
[43:02] Spirit Come into tonight and energize us
[43:05] and free us from all these fears and
[43:07] doubts Revival has
[43:09] [Music]
[43:10] come amen notice and I I tell you do
[43:14] this because Satan can come in with
[43:16] doubts and fear say I reject doubt I
[43:18] reject fear just speak those words those
[43:21] demons will leave yes and sometimes if
[43:23] those demons can't possess you the
[43:25] prophet says they are spirits hanging
[43:27] over you they come to to cause that
[43:30] uneasiness you feel that heaviness he
[43:32] says the spirit hanging over you he's
[43:34] Discerning the audence I see a spirit
[43:36] hanging over
[43:37] you so they know they can't enter you
[43:39] you don't have legal Authority okay so
[43:41] they come to over around right come to
[43:44] whisper but the suban was telling me
[43:46] that there while his mother was sleeping
[43:47] in the bed there was another lady there
[43:49] on the other side telling her ah this
[43:51] thing is nothing just sign the paper and
[43:54] by the way he just told me now before
[43:56] the service that on Friday his mother
[43:58] did sign the paper for the
[44:01] amputation because of
[44:04] influence right but we thank God Amen
[44:07] that the prayers have intervened amen
[44:10] hallelujah so I'm saying look at the
[44:11] influence now but the suent said that
[44:13] lady was sitting sleeping on the other
[44:15] side of the bed and said I've been for a
[44:16] couple of these it's nothing just do it
[44:19] you see demon powers want you to join
[44:20] their ranks right you don't join their
[44:23] ranks for nothing you don't give up yes
[44:27] amen amen we must be bold Warriors now
[44:29] come let's move quickly
[44:31] amen now I want to bring this because I
[44:33] want to show
[44:35] you how powerful you are on the
[44:37] earth I want to show you that God is
[44:41] depending on you and everyone is in in a
[44:44] battle for your spirit and your soul and
[44:46] for your access to your body is what I'm
[44:47] trying to say he says remember Devils
[44:50] never die Devils always live but there
[44:54] will be a time when Devils will have to
[44:55] die they will be become totally
[44:57] annihilated but now they are alive and
[44:59] they work from generation to generation
[45:01] upon human
[45:03] beings some of them is in the form of
[45:05] cancer some in the form of epilepsy some
[45:09] in the form of tuberculosis they get
[45:11] into the flesh but seemingly they are
[45:15] powerless until they can get into a
[45:18] person right where they must be in a
[45:21] person now remember he's a counterfeit
[45:24] what God is trying to achieve is get
[45:25] into a person
[45:27] he wants to achieve that now listen how
[45:29] he brings his thought about the Holy
[45:30] Spirit now they have to operate through
[45:34] a person so all Spirit beings must
[45:36] operate through a person otherwise they
[45:38] are powerless on the earth because God
[45:41] made man to have dominion on the earth
[45:43] amen everybody understand that the
[45:45] prophet's going to clarify this now
[45:46] which brings to another thought that the
[45:49] Holy Spirit covers the earth but is
[45:51] almost helpless until it gets into you
[45:54] and me amen so who can render the Holy
[45:56] Ghost
[45:57] powerless You and Me by not allowing him
[46:00] access to our bodies to our spirits to
[46:03] our
[46:04] souls he says the holy spirit that
[46:06] covers of the earth is almost helpless
[46:08] until it can get into you and me God is
[46:11] depending on you and I the Holy Spirit
[46:14] the Earth is full of the spirit of God
[46:16] but it's poured out it cannot operate
[46:19] until it comes into
[46:23] us we human beings to operate yes why
[46:27] God won't violate his own word he said
[46:30] you'll be God of the earth man you'll
[46:32] have dominion on the earth I'll be God
[46:34] of the heavens we know that Psalm 115
[46:36] there amen when God said in Genesis 1:
[46:39] 126 I'll make man in my
[46:41] image and 27 he says he created man in
[46:45] His image and he said you shall have
[46:46] dominion on the earth God won't violate
[46:48] his own word so if he wants to do
[46:50] anything on the earth he will always
[46:52] work through a man that's why you find
[46:54] from Genesis he always tried to connect
[46:56] with a man
[46:57] amen Abraham Noah all of these things to
[47:00] do things on the earth everybody's
[47:02] understanding this point God won't
[47:03] violate his word he's got to work
[47:05] through a man the prophet says God's
[47:06] agency is man he won't work outside of
[47:09] man he don't use Mechanical Devices like
[47:11] tapes and books and all of these things
[47:13] he uses man to preach the gospel he said
[47:16] he could have chosen the Sun the moon
[47:17] the stars he could have chosen the
[47:19] animals but he chose man amen yes thank
[47:22] you
[47:24] Lord now I ask you to so and think about
[47:27] that have you allowed the Holy Ghost
[47:29] full access or are you rendering him
[47:31] powerless in your
[47:33] life very
[47:37] important God is depending on you and I
[47:40] the whole earth is full of the spirit of
[47:42] God but it's poured out but it cannot
[47:45] operate until it comes into us we human
[47:47] beings to operate and the devil wants to
[47:51] take us over to operate under him you
[47:55] see contest for you you you become the
[47:58] most valuable prize on the earth Prophet
[48:01] says your soul is worth 10,000
[48:03] worlds so when he gets the mild form he
[48:07] starts in sin if he can get him in just
[48:10] a righteous man a good man and just let
[48:12] him go ahead and try to be good like
[48:14] that and that's the condition of message
[48:16] people don't worry in the
[48:18] message you believe the
[48:22] prophet I if you can tap yourself
[48:27] don't you're good nothing else for you
[48:30] to do that's why most people's
[48:32] expectation is still looking and being
[48:35] warmed by a painted fire 60 years ago
[48:38] amen they want brother Brandon to do
[48:40] everything for them there's nothing for
[48:42] you to do what did Satan do deceived
[48:47] you he deceived you yeah the prophet of
[48:50] God is saying
[48:52] this he wants to take all of a righteous
[48:55] man good man just let him go ahead and
[48:57] try to be good like that you see if you
[49:01] can get all of him like that until he's
[49:07] dead so don't get caught up in
[49:10] deception remember the deception he says
[49:12] is if he when you realize who you are
[49:16] recognize who you are what you can do
[49:19] that you can do the Greater Works then
[49:21] he becomes
[49:22] powerless so the deception is going to
[49:24] come right there to make you think
[49:25] you're in the message you're believing
[49:27] the truth you you know God sent a
[49:29] prophet you're
[49:32] fine but there's no power of the Holy
[49:34] Ghost in your
[49:36] life am I am I making this up he's the
[49:39] prophet saying it he'll keep you in a
[49:41] good religious form until you are
[49:44] dead that's just what he wants to do
[49:46] he's got him because no matter how
[49:48] righteous you are how good you are how
[49:50] moral you are how clean you are how
[49:53] honest you are you will never get to
[49:55] Heaven until you're born again
[49:57] am Hallelujah right Jesus said so you've
[50:01] got to be
[50:02] regenerated
[50:05] right well we got to get back Yonder
[50:07] when our forefathers got it you see
[50:10] Satan always trying to keep you looking
[50:13] backwards amen he says we can say to the
[50:16] Pentecostal Brethren well what we got
[50:19] back Yonder when our forefathers got it
[50:21] 50 years
[50:23] ago don't never look backward
[50:28] my message to the message church is
[50:30] don't ever look backward God is always
[50:33] Progressive amen
[50:35] yes keep looking
[50:38] forward he says science even Don't Look
[50:41] Backwards they're always looking to
[50:42] explore new things science is going to
[50:45] find God before the preacher does if we
[50:47] don't watch
[50:49] it he says that scientists has taken man
[50:52] more into higher Realms of the spirit
[50:55] than preachers have taken them
[50:58] right why they are tapping into
[51:00] spiritual
[51:03] laws sign some 300 years ago French
[51:07] scientist if a person could get a
[51:09] terrific speed of 35 M hour he thought
[51:11] that was great he says but they didn't
[51:13] stop there you think modern science
[51:15] would listen to that certainly not he's
[51:17] going 2,000 M an hour
[51:19] now and he's not even stopping at that
[51:22] he's going on and we try to look back
[51:24] and see what somebody else said
[51:28] oh Church let's wake
[51:29] [Music]
[51:34] up amen just want to reiterate you what
[51:37] we said earlier he says all things are
[51:39] possible to them that believe we've got
[51:42] the untapped resources of God at our
[51:45] ends to display God Amen
[51:49] Hallelujah yes sir now if if there's a
[51:54] resource it must come from a source
[51:57] right and our source is
[51:59] Aba ABA father ABA father has given us
[52:02] Kingdom
[52:04] resources but they
[52:07] untapped now listen to what he's saying
[52:09] because healing is
[52:14] tapped he was operating in healing
[52:17] salvation is tapped these are resources
[52:19] but they are
[52:21] untapped how to operate in the spiritual
[52:24] Dimension how to connect with the angel
[52:27] of God untapped
[52:30] resources are you following
[52:32] me we got the untapped resources of God
[52:35] at our hand to display God we are Sons
[52:38] and Daughters of God God made man he
[52:40] made him a God he gave him dominion over
[52:43] the Earth but his Fallen estate dropped
[52:45] that but what they lost by Adam it was
[52:49] restored by Christ amen yes l so I'm
[52:53] saying wake up Satan is lying to you
[52:57] tell him you are back in the image again
[52:59] amen amen hallelujah you are coming into
[53:02] the likeness of Jesus Christ amen
[53:04] nothing can hold you back right now
[53:05] nothing should be able to stop you we
[53:07] should be the mightiest Army on the
[53:09] Earth right now we should be the most
[53:11] powerful Church on the Earth right now
[53:13] Sons and Daughters of God awaken
[53:16] amen amen amen and the glory is becoming
[53:20] more radiant in The Bride As She's
[53:22] Awakening amen the kind of Glory is
[53:24] pouring in and pouring in and pouring In
[53:28] Praise the
[53:30] Lord straight after that he goes to Mark
[53:32] 11:23 I'm telling you this is the main
[53:35] scripture to get you back to your
[53:37] position this is how Adam operated amen
[53:40] if you say to this mountain be moved
[53:42] don't doubt in your heart yes sir but
[53:45] believe what you have said not think
[53:47] what you have said shall come to pass
[53:50] you can have what you've said all things
[53:52] whatsoever you desire When you pray
[53:54] believe you receive it and you shall
[53:55] have it He restored to us all that was
[53:58] lost in
[54:00] Adam so I want you to go make a claim to
[54:02] the
[54:03] enemy and if he says no no shut
[54:07] up I have been restored to all
[54:10] things but of course the things of God
[54:12] must be believed by
[54:14] faith he says but today what we think
[54:17] we're going to church putting he says
[54:19] let's move past this now I'm trying to
[54:20] read what he's saying don't put your
[54:22] name on the book don't be must sprinkled
[54:25] whatever it is shake hands with with the
[54:26] congregation with the pastor and think
[54:28] that settles it he says we come up to
[54:30] Pentecost receive the Holy Ghost it fell
[54:32] upon us we began shouting praising God
[54:35] power of God come down spoke in tongues
[54:37] heard them interpret them make great
[54:40] pations so forth prophecies that sounds
[54:43] fine but we just stop that's just the
[54:45] beginning keep moving on Amen keep
[54:49] moving on and on God is depending on us
[54:52] oh we receive the opening of the word
[54:54] all Mysteries are revealed that's not it
[54:56] keep moving on there's a reason why
[54:58] those Mysteries came the seals were open
[55:00] so Sons could come to manifestation so
[55:02] that Romans 8 could be fulfilled amen
[55:05] there must be a move of God Amen and
[55:07] unless we recognize that we are called
[55:09] for this purpose for this in this hour
[55:11] amen nothing will move we've got to
[55:14] recognize and step up to our god-given
[55:17] potentials
[55:19] amen praise the
[55:22] Lord hallelujah amen
[55:28] let's get to the next quote not that one
[55:30] there not the one that says son born in
[55:32] the
[55:34] home not the sweetest words in the Bible
[55:37] the next one and remember God Amen
[55:40] praise the Lord yeah this one this is
[55:43] what we're getting to now and remember
[55:45] God is looking to me to see that I stay
[55:48] in the
[55:50] word and I'm looking to you to see that
[55:53] you carry out the word so received the
[55:57] Revelation and one must do the
[56:02] manifestation praise the
[56:04] Lord and keep it spiritual remember all
[56:07] the forces of the dark kingdom of Satan
[56:09] will be turned against you as you begin
[56:11] to grow in the Lord remember what we
[56:14] read in the opening scripture is there's
[56:16] an invading Army coming to the sides of
[56:18] the
[56:18] north the dark kingdom of Satan will be
[56:21] turned against you and you must be
[56:24] soldiers amen not just fresh recruits
[56:28] amen your aged soldiers now and being
[56:32] trained to fight am and Satan will come
[56:35] among you and cause you to dispute with
[56:37] one another if he can how can he do it
[56:40] if we allow him he's saying if he can
[56:43] turn him down just immediately you're
[56:47] Brethren and it's the enemy and we here
[56:50] to hold a standard in the evening light
[56:52] time when the world is darkened and the
[56:55] whole church Kingdom is going into the
[56:57] Council of churches and pretty soon
[56:59] they'll take a sign on the door here
[57:03] closed you know most message people
[57:05] think that's when it's going to
[57:06] end that a church will be closed and we
[57:09] won't be able to meet but watch his next
[57:11] statement and will meet other places you
[57:14] can't stop this bright from Gathering
[57:16] because it says forsake not the
[57:18] assembling together of ourselves some
[57:20] people can't wait for them to take that
[57:22] sign they don't like to come to church
[57:25] you say Hey Now government said you
[57:26] can't go
[57:27] Church against the law to go church he
[57:30] says yeah and they're going to have to
[57:33] meet other
[57:38] places cuz they'll certainly close these
[57:40] churches one of these
[57:43] days if we don't take the mark of the
[57:45] beast and we're depending on staying
[57:48] true to god Till Death sets us free and
[57:51] that's what we intend to do praise the
[57:54] Lord amen
[57:57] so what is Christ wanting to do now he
[58:00] wants to have the preeminence in you
[58:03] amen
[58:06] hallelujah let's get to paragraph there
[58:10] 143 we know he love fatherhood he was a
[58:13] father he could express himself through
[58:15] a son I'm trying to get to a purpose
[58:17] here one of his great three four
[58:18] purposes was to express himself identify
[58:22] himself with human beings to reveal
[58:24] himself in Christ
[58:26] to have the preeminence in his body of
[58:28] Believers that is his bride that he
[58:31] might live in
[58:32] people it's no longer I that liveth but
[58:35] Christ that liveth in me Galatians 2:20
[58:38] and the faith that I now have is the
[58:40] faith of the Son of God Amen now how
[58:44] could he do that in Adam and Eve but
[58:46] soon separated them now there had to be
[58:49] some way to get it back again revealing
[58:51] himself revealing himself in Christ and
[58:54] then bring that fullness of the goded
[58:56] bodily into a people that he could have
[58:58] the preeminence the oversight and the
[59:01] leading or if you get in prison then
[59:05] that's when he can express the
[59:14] [Music]
[59:26] this is currently where we are we are we
[59:29] are between the second and the third one
[59:30] right now to have the preeminence so he
[59:33] can restore the kingdom you're going to
[59:35] see effects of the Kingdom being
[59:37] restored on the earth before you leave
[59:38] the
[59:41] Earth hello you are going to see effects
[59:44] of the Kingdom being restored in your
[59:46] your Dominion Authority and the power of
[59:47] the spoken word and all of these things
[59:49] unlocked to you
[59:51] amen cuz his bride will be on display
[59:57] praise the
[59:59] Lord so what are we doing right now we
[1:00:02] are losing our mind to take on the mind
[1:00:05] of Christ thank you Lord some of us can
[1:00:08] say I've lost my mind and I have the
[1:00:10] mind of Christ praise the Lord
[1:00:14] amen hallelujah so what is the Holy
[1:00:17] Ghost doing now the Holy Ghost is either
[1:00:21] your life-giving Source or it's becoming
[1:00:23] a stumbling block to you amen praise the
[1:00:27] Lord let's read let's read this last one
[1:00:30] as we close
[1:00:36] now 375 and through that purpose he
[1:00:40] achieved a church that the fullness of
[1:00:43] God might bring to pass every promised
[1:00:45] word of God in the last days when he
[1:00:47] gets the pinenes pinenes in the church
[1:00:50] the position his place in the
[1:00:54] church then straight he goes to
[1:00:56] scripture he that believeth on me the
[1:00:59] works that I do shall he do also even
[1:01:01] more than this shall he do for I go to
[1:01:03] my father straight away he's putting the
[1:01:05] responsibility on you as soon as Christ
[1:01:07] gets his position he wants you to
[1:01:09] operate scripture can you see what the
[1:01:11] prophet is doing there as soon as he
[1:01:14] tells you what's Christ doing now he's
[1:01:17] telling you the scripture to
[1:01:18] manifest The Works that I do even
[1:01:21] Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:01:22] that was his purpose there was the
[1:01:24] manifestation and now today he wants to
[1:01:27] get somebody that can see it so they can
[1:01:30] let the
[1:01:31] word that's the same as it is today the
[1:01:34] stumbling block so brother Bram was
[1:01:36] talking about how Noah was building the
[1:01:38] ark and he says that Noah's preaching
[1:01:41] and you know no evidence of rain became
[1:01:43] a stumbling block but he said he
[1:01:45] continued to build but he says that's
[1:01:47] the same as it is today the stumbling
[1:01:49] block the holy spirit that is making the
[1:01:52] world where they don't want it the thing
[1:01:54] that they are turning down is the very
[1:01:56] that will take them up in the church so
[1:01:58] the thing that Noah was building is a
[1:02:00] thing that was going to save them so the
[1:02:02] holy ghost that is sent to build the
[1:02:04] church they don't want the Holy Ghost
