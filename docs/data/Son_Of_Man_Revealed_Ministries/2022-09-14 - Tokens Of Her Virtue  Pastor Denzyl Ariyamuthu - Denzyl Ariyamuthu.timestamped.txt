[8:16] amen amen
[8:18] greetings to you brothers and sisters in
[8:19] the wonderful name
[8:20] of our lord and our savior jesus christ
[8:23] and
[8:24] while we're standing we're going to turn
[8:25] to the book of genesis chapter 28.
[8:36] genesis chapter 38.
[8:52] and congratulations to him and his
[8:53] family
[8:55] on the birth of the little girl baby and
[8:58] also the blessing to the home and of the
[9:00] church
[9:02] genesis 38 from verse 1
[9:04] and it came to pass at that time that
[9:07] judah went down from his brother and
[9:09] turned into a certain abdullah might
[9:12] whose name was haira
[9:14] and judah saw their daughter of a
[9:16] certain canaanite whose name was shua
[9:18] and he took her and went into her
[9:20] and she conceived and bear his son and
[9:22] called his name up
[9:24] and she conceived again and bear's son
[9:26] and she called his name onan
[9:28] and she yet again conceived and bear son
[9:31] and called his name sheila and he was at
[9:34] shahzeb
[9:35] when she bare him
[9:36] and judah took a wife for his first born
[9:39] whose name was tamar and uh judah's
[9:41] firstborn was wicked in the sight of the
[9:43] lord and the lord him
[9:45] and judah said unto on go in unto thy
[9:47] brother's wife and marry her and raise
[9:49] up seed to thy brother
[9:51] and ona knew that the seed should not be
[9:54] his and it came to pass when he went in
[9:56] unto his brother's wife that he spoke on
[9:58] the ground they said he should give seed
[10:00] to his brother and the thing which he
[10:02] did displease the lord wherefore he slew
[10:04] him also
[10:06] then said judah to tamara his
[10:07] daughter-in-law remained a widow at thy
[10:09] father's house to shella my son be
[10:12] groaned for he said lest periventure he
[10:14] died also as his brother did and tamar
[10:17] went and drove in her father's house
[10:19] verse 12 in the process of time the
[10:22] daughter of shua judah's wife died and
[10:24] judah was comforted and went up unto his
[10:27] sheepsheaders to timnah he and his
[10:30] friend hira the abdullah might
[10:32] it was told tamar saying behold thy
[10:35] father-in-law uh go up to timnah to
[10:37] share his sheep
[10:39] and she put her widow's garments off
[10:41] from her and covered her with a veil and
[10:43] wrapped herself and sat in an open place
[10:46] which is by the way to timnet but she
[10:48] saw that sheila was grown and she was
[10:50] not given unto him and unto him to wife
[10:54] and she was not given unto him to wife
[10:56] and when judah saw her he taught her to
[10:58] be and harlow because she had covered
[11:00] her face and he turned unto her by the
[11:02] way and said go to i pray here let me
[11:05] come in unto thee for he knew not what
[11:08] she knew not what not that she was his
[11:11] daughter-in-law and she said what will
[11:13] thou give me the dharma is coming out to
[11:16] me and he said i will send you a kid
[11:18] from the flock and she said well thou
[11:19] give me a pledge till thou send it he
[11:22] said what pledge shall i give thee and
[11:24] she said thy this is her request and thy
[11:27] segment they bracelet their stuff that
[11:29] is in thy hand and he gave it to her he
[11:31] gave it to her and it came
[11:33] and he came in and she conceived by him
[11:35] and she arose and went away and laid by
[11:38] her veil from her
[11:39] and put on the garments of a widowhood
[11:42] and then we want to just quickly look at
[11:43] deuteronomy chapter 25.
[11:53] verse 6.
[11:57] or verse 5
[12:00] from verse 5
[12:04] it says if brothers dwell together and
[12:06] one of them die and have no child the
[12:08] wife of the dead shall not marry without
[12:10] unto a stranger a husband's brother
[12:13] shall go in unto her and take her to him
[12:15] to wife and perform the duty of her
[12:17] husband's brother unto her
[12:19] and it shall be that the firstborn which
[12:21] she buried shall succeed in the name of
[12:23] his brother which is the dead that his
[12:25] name may not be put out of israel if the
[12:28] man like not to take his brother's wife
[12:30] and let his brother's wife go up and
[12:33] then let his brother's wife go up to the
[12:35] gate and to the elders and say my
[12:37] husband's brother refused
[12:39] to raise up
[12:41] unto his brother a name in israel he
[12:42] will not perform the duty of my
[12:44] husband's father then the elders of his
[12:46] city shall call him and speak unto him
[12:49] and if he stand to it and say i like not
[12:51] to take her then shall his brother's
[12:53] wife come unto him in the presence of
[12:55] the elders and loose issues some of his
[12:58] foot and spit in his face and shall
[13:00] answer and say so shall it be done unto
[13:02] that man that will not build up his
[13:04] brother's house and his name shall be
[13:06] called in israel the house of him that
[13:08] had issue loose lord bless the reading
[13:11] of his word you can take a seat
[13:15] uh just for a title for our sermon
[13:18] uh we're gonna tell these tokens of
[13:20] tokens of her virtue
[13:23] and um just happy to see um
[13:27] our precious uh brother tonight
[13:30] and uh the rest of the church
[13:32] and um
[13:34] so tonight
[13:36] the title is a tokens of a virtue
[13:39] and this woman tamayo
[13:41] is a uh is a virtuous woman in the bible
[13:44] amen
[13:45] and judah her father-in-law said she is
[13:48] more righteous than even what i am
[13:51] those were his words
[13:53] and judah we know he types christ
[13:56] and tama types the bride
[13:58] and the question is how can the bride be
[14:00] more righteous than he is
[14:02] and see um but it was not her
[14:05] righteousness alone
[14:07] because her she held the tokens in her
[14:10] hand and the tokens that she held in her
[14:12] hand belonged to him the stop the
[14:15] bracelets and the sickness so in other
[14:17] words it was not her righteousness alone
[14:20] that she was speaking about amen and um
[14:22] the things that she had in her hand was
[14:25] uh his identifications and in other
[14:28] words like blah blah says the two parts
[14:30] of the word are becoming one in this
[14:32] last day she attacks the bride
[14:34] and so when we speak about the story and
[14:36] we speak about her act of righteousness
[14:39] you will learn that um
[14:42] you learn to understand that the law in
[14:44] the old testament was that if a man had
[14:47] died without having any children then
[14:50] his younger brother could marry uh could
[14:53] marry his wife
[14:54] in order to raise up seed in his
[14:56] brother's name means that he was to
[14:59] raise up seed in the name of the dead to
[15:02] keep his name alive in israel
[15:05] and so if you look back at the old
[15:07] testament you find out here that
[15:10] there was a um there was a young man
[15:12] called abel and abel was killed in eden
[15:15] abel died and the bible records no
[15:18] children uh to able
[15:21] he uh if you look at the genealogy of
[15:23] adam you find uh abel is not there
[15:26] because abel had no children yeah so uh
[15:29] yeah evil had no children but the
[15:31] scripture says yeah that the blood of
[15:33] abel was crying out from the ground amen
[15:36] and we know like
[15:37] says the life
[15:39] life is in the blood amen and the
[15:41] prophet says that life is the spirit the
[15:44] holy spirit in the blood of jesus christ
[15:46] means that the the spirit in the blood
[15:50] so in other words the spirit of abel was
[15:52] crying out from the ground and then the
[15:54] bible says here that set was raised in
[15:57] the state of abel in other words uh
[16:00] seth was
[16:01] raised to replace abel to take abel's
[16:04] place in other words so seth took the
[16:06] place of abel
[16:08] and set once to complete the work that
[16:11] abel had started set was to raise seed
[16:15] after abel in other words and abel we
[16:17] know he typed jesus christ he typed
[16:20] christ the lamb that was to be slain the
[16:23] lamb that was going to die but set type
[16:26] the resurrection brother said amen the
[16:28] one that raised up titling the holy
[16:30] ghost and abel typed jesus christ the
[16:33] lamb that was going to be crucified and
[16:35] dying amen and so yeah seth was raised
[16:38] up to take the place of abel said times
[16:41] the holy ghost we said
[16:43] abel we said had no seed but set had
[16:46] seen amen and we know jesus in his
[16:49] earthly body because abel types jesus
[16:52] jesus in his earthly body that he had
[16:54] come in he had no seed
[16:56] he had no children and he died having no
[17:00] children having no seed but we know that
[17:02] when they pierced him at calvary but the
[17:04] man says he says the blood cell burst at
[17:07] calvary and the light that was in the
[17:09] blood cell which is the spirit that
[17:11] spirit came out of that blood cell and
[17:14] came down on the pentecost into the
[17:16] believers amen
[17:19] and what did the holy ghost do on the
[17:21] day of pentecost the holy ghost brought
[17:23] forth seeds amen the only ghost
[17:25] manifested sons and daughters unto god
[17:29] so in other words you see jesus
[17:31] abel being a type of jesus died having
[17:34] no seed but set being a type of the holy
[17:37] ghost he brings forth seed
[17:40] and
[17:41] jesus promised before his death he says
[17:45] he says uh he says um that uh the
[17:48] comforter will come after me
[17:51] and when the comforter comes he will
[17:53] bring to your remembrance all the things
[17:55] that i have told you and he will come in
[17:57] my name yes amen means that the holy
[17:59] ghost which type said was to bring
[18:02] children in the name of jesus christ
[18:05] meaning the name of one that died not
[18:07] bringing forth sin
[18:09] it's a tight brother and sisters
[18:11] and we know here that paul uh met the
[18:14] poor of fire on his way to damascus and
[18:18] when paul was struck by that light paul
[18:21] asked the question who art thou lord yes
[18:23] and the answer the lord gave me says i
[18:25] am jesus that doubt persecutors and the
[18:28] man said it was the pillar of fire that
[18:31] struck down paul and the pearl of fire
[18:34] said my name is jesus i am jesus and we
[18:38] know like the lamb says the same power
[18:40] of fire dividing himself in the upper
[18:42] room amongst those believers and when
[18:45] they had seen them there were leaks of
[18:46] fires upon them so burma said the same
[18:50] pearl of fire divided himself in the
[18:52] apparent means it was jesus himself like
[18:55] he said the prophets i am jesus jesus
[18:58] divided himself amongst the believers in
[19:01] other words the holy ghost is raising up
[19:03] children in the name of jesus amen amen
[19:08] and that's why when you read the bible
[19:09] you see peter on the day of pentecost he
[19:12] had the revelation of that name amen
[19:15] amen and uh remember we uh said the law
[19:18] was that if a man would not uh not raise
[19:22] seed in his brother's name then
[19:25] he was to be taken to the high priest or
[19:27] the elders and they would take yeshua
[19:29] off and they would spit on him
[19:31] and so when you look at the old
[19:33] testament brothers and sisters
[19:35] god himself was husband to israel the
[19:38] bible says he called himself husband to
[19:40] israel but israel did not manifest
[19:43] children to the promise of god's word
[19:46] they rejected god in the old testament
[19:49] they rejected his word and they did not
[19:51] manifest that promised word
[19:53] meaning they did not bring forth seed
[19:56] and uh if you read the old testament
[19:58] they kept going into idolatry and fought
[20:00] back and forth back and forth
[20:02] and so they were not able to bring forth
[20:05] seed but god had changed his form
[20:08] god changed his tent god became kinsmen
[20:11] god come in the form of jesus christ in
[20:13] order to recede in his own name amen
[20:18] in other words the reason that jesus had
[20:20] come was so that now he could raise seed
[20:23] in god's name and jesus said i come in
[20:26] my father's name amen amen amen means
[20:29] that the name that he was carrying was
[20:31] his father's name yes but his father in
[20:33] the old testament could not bring forth
[20:35] seed with israel so he had to come in
[20:37] the form of jesus christ to bring forth
[20:39] that seed
[20:40] yes but we finally when he had come to
[20:43] israel
[20:45] they had taken jesus to the high priest
[20:47] to the elders and what did they do they
[20:49] spit on his face
[20:51] they took up his clothes they took off
[20:53] his shoes nakedly hung on the cross amen
[20:57] means they they had rejected it wasn't
[20:59] jesus that had rejected bringing forth
[21:01] sin in the name of his father but they
[21:04] had rejected jesus and they went and
[21:06] took off his shoe they spat on his face
[21:09] and they said he did not bring forth
[21:11] seed
[21:12] but it was not him it was them amen they
[21:16] killed him
[21:17] and then we know the gospel turned to
[21:19] the gentiles and then his spirit came
[21:21] down and they are pentecost to raise up
[21:24] children unto his name
[21:26] and so you see this
[21:28] this law being fulfilled in time you can
[21:31] read the book of uh the story of ruth
[21:33] and boaz you'll see this law being
[21:35] fulfilled also there
[21:37] now in the story of tama
[21:40] we find out here that she was married to
[21:42] the eldest son of judah
[21:44] and his name was uh
[21:46] and
[21:47] tama is a gentile woman
[21:50] and she is brought into the jewish tribe
[21:54] of judah by marriage yes she is the
[21:57] first woman
[21:58] to be mentioned in the genealogy of
[22:01] jesus
[22:02] and the bible mentions uh and says that
[22:05] it was evil in his ways and god killed
[22:08] him because of his evil ways
[22:11] now for a type tonight brothers and
[22:13] sisters
[22:15] uh types the sadistic church age
[22:18] means that he come out from roman
[22:20] catholicism
[22:21] under the teaching where the pope was
[22:23] the intercessor for man
[22:25] he was sitting in the place of god in
[22:28] the place of the son of man
[22:30] and uh
[22:31] but luda
[22:33] with the revelation that he had received
[22:35] that there was only one mediator between
[22:37] man and god and that was not the pope
[22:39] but the man jesus christ
[22:42] and when uh luther began to read romans
[22:45] chapter 1 verse 17 and then the
[22:47] revelation struck his heart and he said
[22:49] the just shall live by faith
[22:53] means faith in jesus and his finished
[22:56] work at calvary means that uh luther it
[22:59] come out of the system of catholicism
[23:02] and he come and received the name of
[23:04] jesus amen that's right
[23:06] but we know like behind said instead of
[23:08] bringing forth seed in the name of jesus
[23:11] the true word instead of raising
[23:13] children in the name of jesus in a
[23:15] sadistic church age the church there
[23:17] denominated amen
[23:19] in other words
[23:21] like brother says is once they
[23:23] denominated they died yes so ah so so
[23:26] the suggestion churchill uh type of the
[23:29] sadistic church age
[23:30] dies
[23:32] not bringing forth seed in the name of
[23:35] jesus
[23:37] then judah we know was given to uh
[23:40] judah giving tamar to onan
[23:43] to raise seed in the name of his brother
[23:46] in the in the name of jesus
[23:48] and shish and and and should have
[23:50] brought for children but onan refused to
[23:53] do that
[23:54] the scripture says he spoke the seed
[23:57] means it wasted the word that they had
[23:59] received because after john was after
[24:02] john wesley and he began to preach
[24:04] certification the philadelphia church
[24:06] age denominated also
[24:08] amen another word that that age never
[24:11] raised children um children in the name
[24:15] of jesus christ the true word but they
[24:17] had their own name which is methodist
[24:19] yes
[24:20] lutherans had lutherans amen and they
[24:23] denominated and just like onan the
[24:26] philadelphia church died when they
[24:28] denominated that's true amen amen calls
[24:32] those names blasphemous names
[24:36] then judah promised tama
[24:38] he says that when my youngest son grows
[24:41] up
[24:42] he said i'll give him to you
[24:45] that by him you could receive in the
[24:48] name of the eldest son
[24:50] but we find out in the story that judah
[24:53] did not do that yes
[24:55] and the youngest sagnya is the type of
[24:58] the pentecostal church
[25:00] and so the bible says when the son had
[25:02] grown up and he was at the age to have
[25:04] children he was not given to tama
[25:09] and tamar realized that she was
[25:11] forgotten
[25:13] but the bride refused to be forgotten
[25:16] amen
[25:17] she knowed what the scripture promised
[25:20] was for her all right she had known the
[25:23] promise that was given that the scepter
[25:25] shall not depart from judah amen amen
[25:28] she had known that the king was going to
[25:30] come out of judah
[25:31] and she known that the scripture says
[25:33] that the the ruling staff shall not
[25:36] depart from him
[25:37] amen until
[25:39] until the tribute comes to him in other
[25:42] words she known that the ruler who is
[25:44] messiah and will be king will come out
[25:47] of the tribe of judah amen
[25:50] was well aware of the prophecy that had
[25:53] been spoken regarding judah
[25:55] but there was two sons dead
[25:58] one son of life
[25:59] somebody there was a womb that was
[26:02] needed to bring forth their seed yeah
[26:04] and tama had a revelation and believe
[26:07] that she was the right room for that
[26:10] promise
[26:12] and she would not let go of that promise
[26:14] brothers and sisters
[26:17] and you could see in the scripture here
[26:19] is she's holding on to that promise the
[26:22] promise that that seed is going to come
[26:24] through my home
[26:26] meaning i'm that promised elected woman
[26:31] and when the bride catches a revelation
[26:33] of that word today she doesn't let go of
[26:36] the promise amen it doesn't matter what
[26:38] comes and what denominators comes from
[26:41] who dies brothers and sisters but the
[26:43] bride that catches a revelation of the
[26:45] promised word for a day holds on to that
[26:47] promise amen amen hallelujah and so
[26:50] tamaya is holding on
[26:52] and she's holding on till she is blessed
[26:55] just like jacob in the bible jacob that
[26:58] wrestled with the angel he said i will
[27:00] not let go of you until you bless me
[27:03] amen and so we see the same spirit upon
[27:06] tamar and i believe the same spirit is
[27:08] upon the bride tonight that will not let
[27:11] go of the promised land
[27:13] [Music]
[27:14] means until the word materializes in her
[27:17] home
[27:19] she is pregnanted by the word for her
[27:21] day she will not let go
[27:24] beautiful thank you
[27:26] now we said here that onan
[27:28] he refused
[27:30] to raise seed in the in the um in the
[27:33] natural in his brother's name
[27:35] because i want to tell you
[27:37] children become here
[27:40] and um they become head to the father's
[27:43] inheritance
[27:44] so in my opinion maybe onan was eyeing
[27:47] out his brother's inheritance for
[27:49] himself
[27:50] and paul says in ephesians 3 verse 6
[27:53] says that the gentiles
[27:55] should be fellow heirs of the same body
[27:57] and partakers of his promise in christ
[28:00] by the gospel
[28:02] meaning that children born into this
[28:04] gospel in the name of jesus christ
[28:06] become here
[28:08] amen there is an inheritance that we
[28:10] become here to brothers and sisters like
[28:13] adam and eden was here and had an
[28:16] inheritance of all things amen
[28:19] now she was promised this youngest son
[28:23] and she did not receive him
[28:26] but she was not interested in him when
[28:28] you read the scripture it's such a
[28:30] strange thing
[28:31] because she was given the she was
[28:33] married to the first born she's given
[28:35] the second bond she's promised the third
[28:37] born but when you read the scripture she
[28:39] has no interest in the third born
[28:44] uh when you read the scripture she did
[28:46] not ask for the third bond
[28:48] she never asked for that youngest son
[28:50] she did not send a message to judah he
[28:53] says uh
[28:54] to say what the little boy is your age
[28:56] and as for your promise he needs to
[28:58] receive to his brother's name she did
[29:01] not do that brothers and sisters
[29:03] and uh and he types the pentecostal
[29:06] church and you know this the condition
[29:08] of the pentecostal church the spiritual
[29:11] condition but the madam came to call a
[29:13] bride out of pentecost amen not take us
[29:16] into pentecost
[29:18] and tama is a type of bride she's not
[29:20] looking to go to pentecost to be
[29:22] stimulated by the guests
[29:25] she's not asking for the gifts tonight
[29:26] but tamar is looking for the giver of
[29:29] the gifts himself
[29:31] amen in other words tamara was a type of
[29:33] the bride she's saying i don't want a
[29:36] measure anymore
[29:38] but what you want is the fullness of
[29:40] judah himself
[29:42] and so she's not looking for a part
[29:44] she's not looking for a measure but she
[29:46] wants the fullness himself
[29:48] and that's what the bride is looking for
[29:50] we're not looking for justification
[29:52] we've had justification we've built onto
[29:54] certification all had a measure apart
[29:57] pentecost was apart and the bride is not
[30:00] looking for a measure tonight but the
[30:01] bride wants to fall amen the bride wants
[30:04] judah himself tonight
[30:08] so the bible says here that judah's wife
[30:11] had died
[30:12] and he was a go to to tim that to share
[30:15] his sheep
[30:16] now you want to place that that that
[30:18] little
[30:19] event in the church ages the sharing of
[30:22] the sheep is when they remove all of the
[30:24] clothing or the will of the sheep right
[30:27] means that the sheep are naked
[30:30] and sheep type people
[30:32] and the ladies in churches the sheep or
[30:34] the people are naked blind and wretched
[30:37] yes so when you read the story at the
[30:39] time of the sharing of the sheep means
[30:42] it's a time of the laodicean churches
[30:44] amen
[30:45] and in the time of the liturgical
[30:46] churches there's a coming of judah to
[30:49] timnah
[30:50] means that the line of the tribe of
[30:52] judah is coming
[30:54] king the opening is coming in this
[30:57] little distinction yes the word himself
[30:59] is coming in the lioness and church age
[31:02] and revelation chapter 10 verse 3 says
[31:05] when he cried out with a loud voice it
[31:08] was as if a ryan a lion roared amen in
[31:12] other words in revelation 10 the king
[31:15] himself is coming to timnah amen in
[31:18] revelation chapter 10 the king is
[31:20] roaring like a lion and seven candies
[31:22] are uttering their voices
[31:25] amen
[31:26] so in the time brothers and sisters
[31:29] judah is sharing his sheep it's the
[31:31] coming of judah in the low distant
[31:33] church age i mean it's a coming in time
[31:35] it's a coming of our judah the line of
[31:38] the tribe of judah revelation chapter 10
[31:40] in this age that we are living in
[31:42] wonderful amen yes means that the labels
[31:46] in church age is his coming age yes
[31:49] and uh
[31:50] brian tamar
[31:52] recognizes his coming
[31:55] the bride will always recognize his
[31:58] coming and what tom had done when she
[32:00] recognized his coming she made herself
[32:03] ready to meet with him amen
[32:06] that's what she done brother sisters
[32:08] when the bride recognizes the coming of
[32:10] the line of the tribe of judah in this
[32:12] age she quickly makes us out ready amen
[32:16] and this room in here
[32:18] the bible says she is dressed
[32:20] as a harlot to go and meet him
[32:23] and that's speaking of a certain
[32:26] condition
[32:27] and brother barum says he says
[32:29] we were born in a hard condition
[32:34] we bought adulteresses
[32:36] we bought off uh uh born out of our
[32:39] adulterous parent eve says not by our
[32:42] choice it's our our natural birth by our
[32:45] natural birth we are born adulterers we
[32:48] are born in sin shaking integrity we
[32:51] come into the world speaking lies in
[32:53] other words we are born a harlot
[32:56] means that the coming of this angel is
[32:59] coming to a woman that's in a hard
[33:01] condition
[33:03] by our natural birth amen
[33:05] we are veiled in a row of flesh which is
[33:08] a rope of a harlot amen and when we meet
[33:11] him we meet him in this harlot condition
[33:14] and the prophet said it's our human
[33:15] nature it's our sticky nature yes amen
[33:19] but judah when he comes he comes he's
[33:21] coming and there's a purpose in this
[33:23] coming he wants to have a relationship
[33:26] with this bride amen in other words he
[33:28] wants to have a union with this bride
[33:31] and remember the purpose of this is to
[33:34] raise seed in the name of the dead
[33:36] amen amen
[33:38] in the name of jesus
[33:40] and so anyway in this coming she asked
[33:42] him
[33:43] what will you give me
[33:45] and uh he said i promise to give you a
[33:48] kid
[33:49] and you know a kid is a goat yes and
[33:52] what the goat symbolizes is redemption
[33:56] and um
[33:57] your brother and sister remember this
[33:59] this bible is a sealed book yes
[34:02] it's hit from the wise and the prudent
[34:05] and reveal that to babes such as with
[34:07] love amen because the story here to a
[34:10] normal reader
[34:11] of the bible can be a really disgusting
[34:14] story yes yes and people that read it
[34:17] with the natural eyes
[34:19] can quickly turn the pages away from
[34:20] their story
[34:22] and um
[34:23] but when you have this spiritual
[34:25] binoculars on
[34:27] and um and your focus is adjust to the
[34:30] word for your day and you sing it
[34:32] through the eyes of this prophet amen
[34:34] then it's it becomes very clear that
[34:36] there's a hidden mis message in the
[34:38] story
[34:40] and you know brother man says he says
[34:41] whenever you read the bible if you don't
[34:43] see jesus christ you're going to go back
[34:45] and look yes amen but
[34:47] [Music]
[34:48] he says when you read the bible you're
[34:49] going to see yourself in the scripture
[34:52] in other words when you read the story
[34:54] of tamar and you've got to apply tamar
[34:56] to you
[34:57] you've got to see yourself as tama
[34:59] you're going to see yourself as rebecca
[35:01] you're going to see yourself as rude
[35:02] brother and sister there's a hidden
[35:04] mystery that's laying in there and the
[35:06] virtue that's laying is there is a
[35:08] virtue that you must possess yourself
[35:13] and so you could read the story and and
[35:15] say it's disgust
[35:17] means there's a virtue of disgust that
[35:19] muslim you or you can read the story and
[35:22] say you know what there's a there's a is
[35:24] a better virtue a holiness laying in the
[35:26] scripture that you have to possess
[35:30] and so yeah when you when you focus your
[35:33] binoculars you bring it begin to see
[35:36] a hidden message in the story and it's a
[35:39] love story
[35:40] and it's a love story at least coming
[35:42] the lion of the tribe of judah christ
[35:44] himself that's coming that is in a union
[35:47] with his bride
[35:49] and so he promised our kid
[35:52] means that he is he promises the bride a
[35:55] redemption
[35:56] all complete atonement
[35:59] now you remember on the day of atonement
[36:01] they take the blood of a goat for
[36:03] redemption that's right so yeah judah is
[36:05] promising this bride i'm gonna give you
[36:07] redemption
[36:09] and that's what we are waiting for
[36:10] brothers and sisters we are waiting for
[36:13] redemption amen we are waiting for a day
[36:15] of redemption we are waiting for the day
[36:17] when this body will be redeemed we will
[36:20] have a change of body we are waiting for
[36:22] that redemption
[36:24] in other words at the coming of this uh
[36:27] of this of judah the line of the time of
[36:29] judah he's promising the bribe that i am
[36:32] going to give you redemption amen amen
[36:35] yes but she says to him
[36:38] until you send that kid
[36:40] because that kid was not there you read
[36:42] the bible he said he says tomorrow i'll
[36:45] send you that kid now tomorrow if you
[36:48] take it literally is tomorrow but
[36:50] spiritually tomorrow is some time
[36:53] right so in other words he's saying to
[36:55] her look we are going to have a union a
[36:58] spiritual union but my promise to you
[37:00] after this union is i'm going to give
[37:02] you redemption tomorrow
[37:05] and so what she is saying to him until
[37:07] you give me redemption
[37:09] until you send that kin until i get my
[37:12] redemption i need some pledges before
[37:14] that
[37:15] i need some tokens before i get full
[37:18] redemption before a body change
[37:23] that he is going to give her before full
[37:26] redemption will be the tokens that will
[37:29] prove that this bride is a virtuous
[37:32] bride keeping the law keeping the word
[37:36] the bible says
[37:38] that she asks for his signet
[37:41] his bracelets his staff
[37:44] and you remember remember in revelation
[37:46] chapter 10
[37:48] john the temple the bride he said give
[37:50] me the book amen yet tama is saying give
[37:53] me the signet give me the bracelet give
[37:56] me the staff and the bride in revelation
[37:59] 10 john is saying give me the book amen
[38:02] mean it's the bride that is asking for
[38:04] those things
[38:06] the signet
[38:08] is his ring
[38:10] and that's his signature
[38:13] that's his seal
[38:15] and uh remember
[38:16] he promised her a kid he promised her
[38:19] redemption
[38:20] but he gives her a ring he gives her his
[38:23] seal in other words grieve not the holy
[38:26] spirit whereby you are sealed until the
[38:29] day of redemption amen means that the
[38:31] seal comes before redemption
[38:34] the bride is going to be sealed before
[38:36] she receives redemption amen and uh the
[38:39] seal becomes your protection until you
[38:42] receive full redemption amen hallelujah
[38:47] and the seal became her protection until
[38:50] she received full redemption amen
[38:54] the seal is the holy ghost amen the holy
[38:56] ghost is our protection yes it's our
[38:59] shield until we come to full redemption
[39:02] amen and we are sealed by the holy ghost
[39:04] we are a seal product of christ himself
[39:08] and nobody can break that seal now the
[39:11] prophet speaks about the ceiling
[39:14] you read it in the holy ghost book the
[39:16] inspection of a cow
[39:18] and he says uh he said when the car is
[39:20] inspected it's sealed
[39:22] and the seal cannot be broken until it
[39:25] reached its final
[39:26] destination yes amen and the same thing
[39:29] with the bride of jesus christ you find
[39:31] bill lamb says that when the bride is
[39:33] sealed he says it's it means that a whom
[39:36] is closed
[39:38] amen amen i'm sure you came across that
[39:40] yes he says the bride is sealed with a
[39:43] whom and a room is closed and she won't
[39:46] receive any creed
[39:48] any dogma any man-made system because
[39:51] she's sealed from receiving any man-made
[39:53] doctrine amen any other seed because
[39:56] she's sealed by the holy ghost amen
[39:59] which comes in the form of the word yes
[40:01] praise the lord in other words brothers
[40:03] and sisters
[40:05] that when we when we have this union
[40:07] with christ we become sealed to anything
[40:10] else
[40:10] [Music]
[40:12] now the signet we said is a man's
[40:15] signature
[40:16] and it means the authority
[40:19] of that man
[40:20] and that authority here is given to the
[40:22] bride
[40:24] and we know that the voice of the
[40:26] bridegroom is in the bride
[40:28] and the prophet says the she becomes the
[40:31] final voice to the final age
[40:34] he gives his seal he gives his signature
[40:36] he gives out
