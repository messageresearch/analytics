[3:46] 12
[3:51] amen so in John chapter 12 we'll read
[3:53] from verse
[3:56] 23 says and Jesus answered them saying
[4:00] the hour is come that the son of man
[4:03] should be
[4:05] glorified do you feel the bride is
[4:07] reaching that position amen amen so the
[4:10] bride can say we feel it in our Spirits
[4:13] we feel it in our soul that the hour is
[4:15] come amen amen that his wife must be
[4:19] glorified now amen verily verily I say
[4:23] but there's a process now and here's the
[4:24] process verily verily I say unto you
[4:28] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[4:30] ground and
[4:31] die it abideth alone but if it die it
[4:35] bringeth forth much
[4:38] fruit so that's the process we under
[4:40] right now he that loveth his life shall
[4:43] lose it and he that hateth his life in
[4:45] this world shall keep it unto Eternal
[4:47] unto life
[4:49] eternal If any man serve me let him
[4:51] follow me and where I am there shall
[4:54] also my servant there shall also my
[4:57] servant be if any man serve me
[5:00] him will my father honor yes amen now is
[5:04] my soul troubled and what shall I say
[5:07] father save me from this hour but for
[5:09] this cause came I unto this hour amen
[5:13] amen the bride has been through birth
[5:15] pains but for this cause for such a time
[5:19] as this have we come to this
[5:22] hour father glorify thy name then came
[5:27] there a voice from Heaven watch son it's
[5:29] going to th now saying I but glorified
[5:32] it and will glorify it
[5:34] again the people thereof that stood by
[5:37] and heard it said that he
[5:40] thundered others said an angel spake to
[5:42] him Jesus answered and said this voice
[5:46] came not because of me but for your
[5:48] sakes amen amen amen one more portion of
[5:51] scripture Amen in the book of
[5:53] Corinthians amen praise the Lord Second
[5:56] Corinthians
[6:00] chapter
[6:01] 3 amen we'll read the entire chapter
[6:05] amen for the sake of those that need to
[6:07] read a chapter a day praise the
[6:12] Lord 2 Corinthians chapter
[6:16] 3 Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves
[6:20] or need we as some others Epistles of
[6:24] commendation to you or letters of
[6:26] commendation from
[6:28] you you are our Epistles written in our
[6:32] hearts known and read of all men for as
[6:35] much as he are manifestly declared to be
[6:38] the Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[6:41] Written not with ink but with the spirit
[6:43] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[6:46] but in fleshly tables of the heart and
[6:49] such trust have we through Christ to
[6:52] godwood not that we are sufficient of
[6:54] ourselves to think anything as of
[6:57] ourselves but our sufficiency is of God
[7:00] Amen yes who had also made us able
[7:04] Ministers of the New Testament not of
[7:06] the letter but of the
[7:09] spirit for the letter kth but the spirit
[7:12] giveth life so the five-fold ministry
[7:15] trueful Ministry is one that is
[7:18] preaching amen from the spirit
[7:22] realm but if the ministration of death
[7:25] written and engraven in stone was
[7:27] glorious so that the children of Israel
[7:29] could not steadfastly behold the face of
[7:32] Moses for the glory of his countenance
[7:34] which Glory was to be done away how
[7:37] shall not the ministration of the spirit
[7:39] be rather glorious
[7:42] amen for if the ministration of
[7:44] condemnation be glory much more do the
[7:47] ministration of righteousness exceed in
[7:49] glory
[7:51] yes for even that which was made
[7:55] glorious had no glory in this Respect by
[7:58] reason of the glory that sell it for if
[8:01] that which is done away was glorious
[8:03] much
[8:04] more that which remaineth is glorious
[8:07] seeing then that we have such hope we
[8:10] use great plainness of
[8:13] speech and not of Moses which put a veil
[8:16] over his face that the children of
[8:18] Israel could not steadfastly look to the
[8:20] end of that which is abolished but their
[8:23] mind Minds were blinded for until this
[8:26] day remaineth the same Veil untaken away
[8:29] way in the reading of the Old Testament
[8:32] yes which Veil is done away in Christ
[8:36] yes but even to this day when Moses is
[8:39] read the veil is upon their heart amen
[8:43] yes now we got another Exodus
[8:45] here right I wonder if people reading
[8:48] bram's message have a veil yeah
[8:51] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[8:53] Lord the veil shall be taken away now
[8:56] the Lord is that spirit and where the
[8:59] spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[9:01] amen hallelujah but we all with open
[9:04] face beholding as in a glass the glory
[9:06] of the Lord are changed into the same
[9:09] image from glory to glory even as by the
[9:12] spirit of the Lord thank amen the Lord
[9:14] had blessings to the reading of his word
[9:16] you may be
[9:20] seated
[9:22] amen so we've been dealing amen with a
[9:24] few thoughts
[9:26] recently and you know we've been dealing
[9:28] really with revelation 10 the unveiling
[9:31] of the mystery of
[9:34] God amen amen every time we talk about
[9:37] our position and anything associated
[9:40] with us
[9:42] amen it is only because the mystery of
[9:45] God has been
[9:46] revealed so all of this is coming out
[9:49] under Revelation
[9:50] 10:7 can you say amen amen in the days
[9:54] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[9:56] he shall began to sound the mystery of
[9:59] God should be finished amen had he not
[10:02] sounded the mystery of God would not be
[10:04] fulfilled revealed so which means our
[10:07] true identity would also be hidden yeah
[10:10] but because the mystery of Christ The
[10:12] Mystery of God is revealed our true
[10:14] identity has now comeing to Plain View
[10:17] amen but remember they can't see past
[10:20] the
[10:22] veil so we see amen that we were
[10:25] revealed because of the mystery of God
[10:27] and we see ourselves in him and now when
[10:29] we see ourselves in him behind the
[10:32] Mysteries we see our name written in the
[10:35] book written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[10:38] amen so we started this year talking
[10:40] about the glory of the Lord how many if
[10:42] you remember that amen hallelujah it's
[10:45] not too far
[10:46] away amen not too long ago we were
[10:49] talking about the glory of God and we
[10:50] haven't stopped it has just evolved into
[10:53] another level yes amen hallelujah
[10:58] usually when you talk about Glory people
[11:00] want to see
[11:02] manifestations have we not seen enough
[11:04] manifestations last year under the
[11:06] supernatural outpouring of the Holy
[11:08] Spirit but I'm going to show you a more
[11:10] glorious thing that has been happening
[11:12] right the glory of the Lord and and
[11:14] remember the the theme of it was share
[11:17] in his
[11:18] glory amen but this Revelation has
[11:21] evolved to a place and it's now breaking
[11:23] at an incredible Pace because when you
[11:26] break that sound barrier you just go
[11:28] amen how many if you can feel that amen
[11:32] hallelujah I feel like we are in an
[11:34] Enoch walk amen hallelujah amen amen and
[11:38] this like I said would not be the glory
[11:40] that's seen in Miracle signs and wonders
[11:43] but the glory we are seeing is that Sons
[11:45] and Daughters of God are coming to full
[11:47] maturity oh yes amen amen to watch that
[11:51] power of transformation can only take
[11:54] the glory of God Amen to bring that seed
[11:57] to maturity amen so this morning I want
[12:00] to talk on and this is the title The
[12:02] Shak of Glory over your seed word oh to
[12:05] bring you to manifested
[12:09] Sons spoken word sons of God the Shak
[12:12] Glory over your seed word to bring you
[12:15] to manifested sons of God amen amen
[12:19] hallelujah amen amen you know in the
[12:22] Book of Luke it tells you it is the
[12:23] Father's good pleasure to give to you
[12:26] the kingdom amen yes it's a father's
[12:28] good pleasure to give it to you you know
[12:30] when you give your children something
[12:31] and you really want to give it to them
[12:33] it's your good pleasure to give it to
[12:35] them and Jesus is telling us it's the
[12:37] father's good pleasure to give us the
[12:39] kingdom amen amen
[12:42] hallelujah praise the
[12:45] Lord now we know that just to uh detail
[12:49] this a bit and give you a background
[12:51] that in the Tabernacle in the setting of
[12:53] The
[12:55] Tabernacle we are shown amen the three
[12:58] parts of the
[13:00] Tabernacle amen yes amen typing God's
[13:04] presence amen
[13:07] hallelujah and we know amen that there
[13:09] was the three areas of the Tabernacle we
[13:12] are the outer Court the holy place and
[13:14] then Beyond the Veil is the holiest of
[13:16] holiest how many of you can say Amen to
[13:17] that you know that Amen to be the truth
[13:20] amen so even so in our human bodies we
[13:23] are likened to these three compartments
[13:26] amen
[13:27] hallelujah because we have have Amen in
[13:31] the area of our flesh
[13:33] body that's the outer court amen we have
[13:37] likened these things amen so the inner
[13:40] court amen the holy Place praise the
[13:43] Lord and then we got the holiest of
[13:47] holies so we know the OT being the body
[13:50] then we got the holy Place being the
[13:52] spirit realm and then down in there is a
[13:55] soul which is the holiest of holies amen
[13:58] where the seed Gene of God resides amen
[14:01] and that's what we are targeting that's
[14:03] what we are after to Quicken that seed
[14:05] Gene within you because that seed Gene
[14:08] came predestinated with the attributes
[14:10] and characteristics of God if we can
[14:12] only get to that seed Gene of God within
[14:14] you and shine God's light upon the Jean
[14:17] seed you are going to come into His
[14:18] Image and
[14:21] likeness amen you can't get nothing else
[14:25] out of an orange seed beside
[14:27] oranges amen so when the seed Gene of
[14:30] God which we are after is in your soul
[14:32] we are shining the light of God's word
[14:34] upon the Jee seed to bring you to your
[14:36] full
[14:37] [Music]
[14:38] manifestation that's why we bringing you
[14:40] into the shik glory realm hallelujah
[14:43] amen this is the time when the sh of
[14:45] Glory is shining in its fullness in its
[14:47] brightness you may not like the process
[14:50] you may think the process is difficult
[14:52] you may think the preaching of the word
[14:54] is hard amen but that's the full
[14:56] strength of the sunlight to shine upon
[14:59] your jeans SE yes Lord thank you Lord
[15:02] thank you Jesus amen thank you Lord
[15:04] praise the Lord now in each level of
[15:06] that Court was different kinds of
[15:08] Lights amen the out Outer Court had
[15:12] natural light yes and then the the inner
[15:16] court so you had the outer Court there
[15:18] you had the inner Court which had
[15:20] Candlestick
[15:22] light there they had Candlestick light
[15:25] typing seven Church
[15:27] ages amen but if you know in the holiest
[15:30] of holies there was no light except sh
[15:32] Glory
[15:34] light Amen to be in there the priest
[15:37] relied on the Shak Glory coming down to
[15:40] give light amen wonderful thank you
[15:43] praise the
[15:44] Lord

[15:50] the Brazen altar we sing how far we come
[15:53] amen we are here at the entrance amen
[15:55] came in at the outer court amen at the
[15:58] East End but when you come to Christ
[16:00] you're coming to the Brazen altar amen
[16:03] but you can't just stay there amen you
[16:05] got to go from the Brazen altar right
[16:07] into the holiest of holies into the
[16:09] place where God reveals himself in his
[16:12] glory personally to you amen it is
[16:14] christing me the hope of glory
[16:17] amen amen hallelujah now many people
[16:21] think when they first come to Christ
[16:23] they gain it all but remember when you
[16:25] first come to Christ you're a baby in
[16:27] Christ yes yes amen you are drinking on
[16:30] milk yes amen
[16:33] hallelujah so you don't have full

[16:45] Hallelujah you don't amen people you
[16:48] have the legal right to get it all when

[16:52] says as many has received him he gave
[16:55] power to become sons of God Amen
[16:59] but there's a there's a long there's a

[17:12] full Authority when you comeing to
[17:15] Christ you have the legal right to have

[17:54] Associated we have come to take you away
[17:56] and connect you with your heavenly
[17:58] family amen yes amen am to show you an

[22:15] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[22:18] how many if you can say that amen if we
[22:20] must fulfill all the word amen yes amen
[22:24] God's thoughts are his word expressed
[22:27] amen God is careful careful to watch
[22:29] over his word Amen brother brandom is
[22:31] telling us that God's thoughts are his
[22:33] word expressed God is careful to watch
[22:35] over his word amen so if we are the word
[22:38] of God we are the word made flesh the
[22:40] thoughts of God the attributes of God
[22:43] the Bible also says that his word will
[22:45] not return void
[22:47] amen

[22:52] if you are the word of God there's a
[22:54] prophecy in the Bible his word will not
[22:57] return void amen so if he sent you into
[22:59] this word as a seed form you can't come
[23:02] back to him as a seed form you've got to
[23:04] come back to him as a mature son and
[23:06] daughter of
[23:08] God thank you yes Lord don't be like

[23:45] everything inside is made of gold the
[23:48] golden Candlestick the beaten gold and
[23:49] the golden Al of incense gold typifies
[23:53] both faith and Divinity beaten gold
[23:55] speaks of which of that which is by
[23:58] Divine by workmanship pure gold speaks
[24:01] of that which is divine by
[24:03] Nature amen now many if you know the
[24:05] prophet says we are likened down to pure
[24:08] gold amen praise the Lord now people

[24:36] Seven Seals were not revealed only in
[24:40] that 7-Day session or 8
[24:42] days if you are thinking the prophet
[24:45] revealed the Seven Seals under that six
[24:47] seven days eight days and he stopped you
[24:50] are solely mistaken that's right you'll
[24:52] find many times the prophet speaking and
[24:54] he says the the mystery that we now have
[24:57] when he's talking about who is this m
[24:59] and he's talking about things that are
[25:01] to be he says it's because of the
[25:02] opening of them Seven Seals amen so all
[25:06] of these Mysteries were under the seven
[25:08] seal
[25:10] amen right you'll find sometimes he's
[25:16] preaching I hope this is okay with you

[26:32] hid the glory of God from the people the
[26:35] badg of skins even people couldn't see

[27:23] when it was made flesh and dwelt amongst
