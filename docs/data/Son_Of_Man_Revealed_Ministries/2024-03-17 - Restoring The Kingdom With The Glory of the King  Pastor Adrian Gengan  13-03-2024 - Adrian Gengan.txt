========================================

praise the Lord amen so we'll read from Verse 18 and it came to pass when he made mention of the Ark of God that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and his neck Breo and he died for he was an old man and heavy and he had judged Israel 40 years this is talking about Eli and his daughter-in-law Phineas wife was with child near to be delivered and when she heard the tidings that the heart of God was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead she bowed herself and prevailed for pains Came Upon her and about the time of her death the woman that stood by her said unto her fear not for thou has born a son but she answered not NE neither did she regard it and she named the child ikabod saying the glory is departed from Israel because the Ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and a husband and she said the glory is departed from Israel for the Ark of God is taken amen praise the Lord let's read Revelation chap 3 amen Revelation 3 verse 20 says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in unto him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne he that ha in here let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches amen praise the Lord you may be seated if you can also open to Esther chapter 3 amen maybe we'll just read from verse chapter 4 there amen so in chapter 4 you're going to see there's a dialogue happening between Moriah atak and Esther we know that modai is typing the end time Prophet aak is typing the fold Ministry so the five for Ministry is getting a word from the end time prophet and taking it to the bride eser amen let's read from verse 8 also he gave him a copy of the writing of the decree that was given at shushan to destroy them to show it unto Esther and to declared unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the king so this is Mori is saying get into the presence of the king get into his glory Realm amen amen hallelujah amen to make supplication unto him and to make request before him for a people and aak came and told Esther the words of moray you see that's typing there five-fold coming to the bride to repeat the words of the end time Prophet amen all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner Court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live but I have not been called to come in unto the king these 30 days and they told to morah Esther's words then Moriah commanded to answer Esther think not with thyself that thou shallal Escape in the King's house more than all the Jews for if thou altogether holdest thyy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father thou sh be destroyed for who knoweth whether Thou come into to the kingdom for such a time as this amen praise the Lord I'd like to speak amen this little topic amen we were speaking on the title deed and showing out the title deed is man's inheritance coming back to the Earth man's Glory coming back to the Earth amen so I'm going to title this restoring the kingdom with the glory of the king amen we an end time people are put here to restore the kingdom of God with the glory of the king amen amen hallelujah amen now just to background this on our first chapter we were reading there how the Ark of the Covenant got captured got taken away and when they are presenting the news that to Eli that the Ark of the Covenant was captured he fell backwards he broke his neck and he died we know the Ark of the Covenant is typing the word of of God when the word of God is taken away amen hallelujah from the people that is the glory of God leaving Israel yes because in the ark dwelt the presence of God the sh kind of glory amen amen so it so shook the prophet of God Eli amen that he he fell backwards he broke his neck when he saw the glory depart from the Kingdom of Israel amen hallelujah now I'm taking this three passages of scriptures to show you in typ then we're coming to the Book of Esther and you'll know that the Book of Esther starts out with the King wanting to display his glory he's got 127 provinces amen and he's displaying his glory he has his seven days of feast amen and His glory is being displayed throughout the kingdom but the highest form of his glory was going to be found in his wife but vasti refused to come out and show the king's glory amen amen he had shown all his wealth he had shown all his treasures he had shown everything that he had achieved in his life materially but here he was going to present the bone of his bone and the Flesh of his flesh but she rejected him yes amen what was she doing refusing to display his glory amen so we know that there's a search made and Esther is chosen in the place of Queen vasti amen for those of you that are familiar with What's Happening Here in the church ages you'll see the Apostle Paul and the early church started out in strength the glory of God was in the church if you're looking at Acts chapter 2 you'll see the glory of God come down in the form of the pillar of fire amen the Holy Ghost filling the people and you're seeing a super Church you're seeing a super race you're seeing an invincible Army in the book of Acts amen amen hallelujah but you what as the Roman Catholic system is coming in on the scene the glory of the Lord is departing amen amen amen hallelujah the glory of the Lord is departing so that through 6,000 through 2,000 years six Church ages coming into the seventh you'll see that they kept rejecting God if you go and read Revelation chapter 3 amen you'll see how the Lord wants to come and reveal the glory but watch now something here we just read Revelation 3:2 when the glory is about to reach its Pinnacle and the highest The Glory gets shut out from the church amen because remember he starts out with Luther restoring justification then he goes with Wesley restoring sanctification the word is getting stronger but as the word gets stronger the word gets kicked out of the churches there's a total rejection of the word amen that's right and they crucify the word again but the Lord sets forth a word that if any man opens the door I've got the glory but it's outside the door amen but if there's somebody in there who can hear my words he that have in here within these churches let them hear what the spirit is saying to the church and if you can hear me and he's talking to the predestinated seeds he says if you hear me I will come in and I will s with you oh thank you Lord so the Lord amen has called us and we have all opened up the door to him amen hallelujah so we find the setting now I'm typing this with Esther you'll find it it progresses now to a time where there's a threat you know that Amon makes a law to kill all the Jews on a certain date amen so modai gets wind of this and he's writing to Esther and he's sending the message via ACH and this is where we at the point of the story is because the King was displaying his glory through all the kingdom watch the type now he shuts himself off and His glory is shut off from the rest of the Kingdom amen nobody can experience the glory of the king any man who comes into his glory will be killed any man who comes into his presence Uninvited will be killed Hallelujah notice the statement that Esther makes that he hasn't called me for 30 days and the lawyers that no man should come into His presence and even if they try to come the Royal scepter must be raised amen hallelujah but nobody wanted to take a chance nobody was bold enough to go into the king's presence amen amen hallelujah but it took a woman of Faith amen amen amen so remember without the glory of the king the kingdom is miserable the kingdom is wondering what's happening to our King yeah you know when they don't see the president for a while or they don't see the king for a while the country wonders what's happening amen so you the glory of the king he's cut off from the rest of the Kingdom all 127 provinces don't see the glory of the king the glory has departed like we read amen but there is one woman who can restore the kingdom with the glory of the king amen amen amen and she must be bold oh she must be courageous amen amen all she has is the word of the Prophet coming via atch amen amen there's nobody else sharing her on there's nobody else giving her the courage to go she is sitting as the and she has the position of Queen I ask you have you been married to the Lord Jesus Christ amen don't sit quiet in the house of the Lord amen I'm asking you a question amen have you been married to the Lord Jesus Christ in this time and season amen the only way the Earth will see the glory of God is through you and me yes amen amen and it takes an Esther to bring the glory of God back to the Earth amen amen so there's a woman that that shut out that's amen nobody is encouraging her nobody is telling her anything she is concerned herself that the King has not come out yet yes yes she's also concerned that the King has not come back yet wow amen are you concerned the king hasn't come back yet amen hallelujah so she says one night she singing even so come Lord Jesus come amen even so she's longing to see him amen amen she sings Oh I want to see him look upon his face she wants the glory back so she will risk it all amen for the preservation of life amen so Esther goes on a fast and she says I will put neither food nor drink in my mouth and you all fast with me but she's going into the presence of the king what is it consecration amen amen it takes a consecration to get into the presence of the king yes amen amen she didn't care about her life she didn't care about risking her life whether she was going to die she said if I perish I perish how many if you feel that way amen unless I get the full baptism of the Holy Ghost unless I get his full anointing and His glory in this time and season if I perish I perish but I must ask of him amen amen thank you amen praise the Lord so we find here she gets into the presence of the king amen and when she gets into the presence of the king the Royal scepter is raised amen and watch what happens now notice it's in Esther chapter 5 the king is Seated on his throne yes and he has the title deed Amen to the king om come on now and in Revelation 5 amen the king steps out of the sanctuary oh yes and he's got the someone's got the title deed Revelation chapter 5 now amen but he comes and he takes the title Deed from the one sitting on the throne what is the title deed it's the right to man it's the inheritance of man it's man's inheritance to the Earth amen amen hallelujah amen you know we've been building up on this the past weeks so can't explain it again amen hallelujah how man lost it and where it ended up amen praise the Lord amen so watch Esther chapter 5 watch Revelation chapter 5 oh thank you Lord two kings amen and he's presenting to Esther and he says I'm going to give you half the kingdom amen what is your request yes amen what is your desire what is your request even to have to Kingdom I won't with all from you my Queen Esther why she opened up the door to his glory she opened up the door to his presence amen hallelujah amen so we find here after seven Church ages amen the glory got cut off from the church amen what they had seen in the early isua Pentecost Revival the outpouring of the gifts if they had stayed there long enough if they had not denominated around the evidence of the Holy Ghost he's speaking in tongues because there was much more to come amen yes amen amen amen the Lord was only starting the work to bring his full Glory back to the Earth amen because the fullness of the word was going to come yes amen he was going to bring back title deed to man's inheritance to the Earth amen but this amen hallelujah the early church denominated they formed organizations then you got the the lutherans wesan Pentecostals amen you got the Methodist Church split amen you got all kinds of denominations splitting from there each one denominating around their Church Creed and Dogma each one believing that the only way to Salvation is if you fellowship with them so they are finding salvation in the church but Salvation is only through Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah amen by one Spirit we are all baptized into the body yes amen hallelujah so find here that the glory was out of the church but here was a man Hallelujah God connects with a man amen because God's Avenue is man and God works with man amen so this man is written off in the Bible amen hallelujah and he is here on the Earth but he was now quick in the scriptures amen and he has the legal Authority he has the legal right on the earth amen amen just like how Mary had the legal right on the earth the angel comes to Mary to say can I use your body and she gives him the legal right to use her body so the angel basically was asking this Prophet do not smoke do not drink do not defile your body from the time he was a little boy because when you grow older I have a work for you to do and now that he has grown older now comes the angel of God to connect with him and tell him about his strange and misunderstood life amen hallelujah amen and he tells him about how Moses was was given two signs you shall be given two signs and you'll take a Ministry of healing to the Nations Hallelujah but there that was not the only thing amen he was going to fulfill and light up Malachi 4:5 amen his ministry had come for you because Malachi 4:5 says behold I sent you amen Elijah the prophet yes before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers yes amen now initially we thought he was only going to turn our hearts all the way back to the original Pentecostal fathers but come to find out when he went in the back part of God's mind he was going to fulfill Ephesians chapter 1 that we were predestinated to be Sons and Daughters of God Amen that he was going to reveal to us our original condition our original spirit that we had and he's taking us back way before the beginning and now we are Eternal as God is eternal amen amen hallelujah amen oh praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah so there was one man who opened the door to the age hallelujah praise the Lord amen actually there's a quote where the Prophet says that that age ceased you know we said shortest Church age amen he says that age sees there and the door for the bride was opened yes amen amen the door for the bride was opened so we come into a bridal time oh yes Lord a time where only those remember he's speaking a word and saying if you open up the door so there's some that open up the door so he's only working with the ones where there is an Open Door amen hallelujah hallelujah thank you oh praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen I pray amen hallelujah the holy spirit will Quicken the gene within you right now amen praise the Lord amen so Esther brings the glory of the king back out to the people amen but he presents to her now the title deed and he says to half the kingdom now remember our Lord Jesus Christ he says amen hallelujah that all power in heaven and in Earth is given unto me when he rose on high he rose triumphantly amen hallelujah praise the Lord so he's God of the heavens and he's God of the earth amen hallelujah there's a kingdom of God in heaven and there's a kingdom of God on Earth amen and he says to up the kingdom I given you thank you the kingdom of the earth I have given back to my bride I have given back to my people amen so we find here that the prophet's Ministry goes on Amen he's turned I don't know about you but I'm not looking for my heart to be turned back my heart is all already turned back can you get a witness here tonight my heart has already been turned back I am not looking for that anymore that scripture has already been fulfilled in my life can you testify and give God praise praise the Lord I'm not looking for Revelation 10:7 to be fulfilled the mystery of God revealed that mystery has already been revealed God is no longer a mystery to us amen hallelujah amen I'm not looking for Luke 17:30 to be fulfilled a son of man revealing the son of man that scripture has already been fulfilled there was the prophet of the age Who lit up those scriptures and he made those scriptures live amen yes that's right praise the Lord Revelation 10 comes into life now because the prophet progresses all the way yes amen and this book that we see in Revelation chapter 5 is coming down in Revelation chapter 10 yes amen the title deed of man's inheritance what is that Bringing Down the glory of God Amen Bringing Down the will of God bringing back the mind of God to the Earth you remember what we spoke a few weeks ago that Eve left the guide Eve left a husband she had no guide to lead her yes amen just like our the church today has rejected the Holy Ghost they rejected the guide but this end time Eve knows that her Lifeline is to connect with the guide amen and that's why she has the mind of Christ because she has the word did did Eve have the word let's let's talk about this did Eve have the true word yes but she had no guide to lead her yes so he says the bride has the word that's pick up your pen and write now I mean the word is in the bride but she needs the guide amen she has the mind of Christ but she know needs to know what to do with the word you see Eve didn't know what to do with the word and the message came to take away all unbelief amen come on now there's no room for unbelief in my life there's no room for unbelief in the body of Christ so when there's no unbelief there's nothing for Satan to work with because Satan can only work through unbelief somebody give God praise amen this end time people amen message of the hour came to take away all unbelief amen so when all unbelief is taken out there's nothing for Satan to work in this bride therefore he is powerless before her yes amen he can only work through doubt and reasoning but the message came to eliminate all doubt and reasoning amen the message came to put us in our rightful estate so we find that the title deed of man's inheritance the title deed to the Earth is coming down in Revelation 10 Hallelujah am but the book can't remain in the hand of the Angel yes the glory of God can't remain in book form yes just like how scriptures Isaiah 7 couldn't remain as a scripture Mary had to light up the scripture and allow God to use her body am there is scriptures in the Bible that you and I have to fulfill amen amen Greater Works than these shall he do for I go unto my father amen hallelujah amen if you say to this mountain be thou removed cast into the sea don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said shall come to pass you shall have what you say now we know that Mark 11:23 could only be fulfilled in this time and the prophet of the age unlocked Mark 11:23 there's not a recorded in all of history that any man operated Mark 11:23 beside this Prophet amen amen thank you Lord amen now we know that this book is coming to a prophet but it's also coming to a prophetic class of people amen this Bride is a prophetic class of people amen hallelujah because she must prophesy again amen so she's got a prophetic Ministry not only that the bride under a messenger becomes the final voice to the final age amen so she's taking this book it can't remain in the Ang Angel's hand so the instruction is given you go and take the book now who is this John John is a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen the same one is found in Revelation 5 the same one is not worthy to take the book but because the perfect one took the book amen and he redeemed man completely because of his faith in Jesus Christ amen he is totally cleansed from all his sins amen he is made perfect and he's put into his original state he seen as sinless he seen as spotless amen he's seen as a worthy one why the sacrifice had been accepted what he had been there doing there for 2000 years Amen in the sanctuary when he comes out amen it signifies that the sacrifice has been accepted therefore he can now take the title deed but the book don't belong in heaven it belongs on the Earth amen amen yes amen hallelujah you are made to be a God on the earth you are made to have dominion on the earth amen amen you were made to take control of every situation amen you don't let problems control you you don't let trials control you amen you control the trial you control the problem amen because within you is locked up Faith within you is locked up virtue within you is locked up knowledge within you is locked up patience within you is locked up Temperance within you is locked up godliness within you is locked up brotherly kindness amen there are no temptation that has overcome you thank you Lord amen so we find the title deed is back on the earth so like I said we are not waiting for that certain scriptures to be fulfilled and now now I'm going to say this now we are not waiting for the title deed to come back to the Earth the title deed is already in me I have already taken the book I have already heat in the book I have already digested the book and now I am the book manifest on the earth somebody give God praise amen amen hallelujah oh hallelujah amen with are people amen hallelujah an invincible Army amen there is no demon power that can stand before you amen every demon power must bow down so like Esther brought the glory of the king back to the people all 127 provinces the commission is given to this end time bride you have taken this book and within you that's the glory of God come that's man's Glory come back to you and you know First Corinthians what it says man is the glory of God amen amen so by you taking the book by you coming back into your rightful position you are displaying the glory of God and thou must prophesy again and show the world that his glory is back on the earth so you be a people who who restore the kingdom of God with the glory of the king amen amen thank you Lord now there's a reason why the head appeared in the sky and not the entire body there's a reason why amen hallelujah the body must remain in Heaven until the restitution of all things is because the head appeared because he has another body now didn't the prophet says he has displayed himself in every way except the Corporal body because he has a body on the Earth so they were only looking for headship they were only looking to connect with the guide they were only looking to connect with the mind of Christ because he has the word and now the bride needs to know what to do with the word so he sends the guide to show the bride what must be done with the word amen amen if we are really being honest for many years the people didn't know what to do with the word they knew they had a word but they didn't know what to do with the word but now comes the revelation of it what to do with the word amen thank Lord amen amen prior to that they were quoting the sequence of events that how the word came to me they were focused on the surroundings it's like I'm going to say it in a veiled way like Rebecca can only tell everyone about how Ela came to her they were telling everyone how Eliza came to her amen but now she's already married to Isaac can she still tell the story amen does that become a Cal theme of her life how Ela came to be no she must not live in the glory realm of Isaac and she must produce the life of Isaac and you'll find that Rebecca is Barren and unfruitful but Isaac goes to praying for his wife Rebecca and she brings four twins hallu thank Youk you Lord now that's also dangerous because now comes Jacob and Esau twins in the body of the Bride so you got some Wild Ones some make Believers amen hallelujah but there's a genuine believer amen there's a genuine believer there there's one whose real name is Israel and he takes the angel of God Amen the angel of God coming down to reveal his name that was written in the book amen yes and that can only come with the opening of the seals you see your name in the book amen amen praise the Lord amen so we see we are end time people who are to manifest the glory of God back on the earth and it is only you Esther who can go into the presence of the king and bring back the glory amen now when you are coming back out with the glory remember you are not only coming out with the glory but you are coming back with the power oh yes she gives the king gives Esther off the kingdom and you go watch there Esther goes to commanding things in the Kingdom she calls the king to a feast she calls Amen to a feast amen and under that Feast she is exposing his plans and schemes now she didn't get this Revelation on her own it came via the prophet so when she speaking these things it sounds like she is saying it oh yes because she is the final voice amen oh yes but only a few people know the source of where it came from amen amen praise the Lord prise the Lord so you got to know how to present the gospel too now is your time amen now is your season amen now is your ministry rise up to it amen prophesy amen hallelujah now is your time to display the glory of God now is the time for you to be on display amen now is not the time amen for us to be focused on material things amen my soul is not satisfied with material things of the earth amen yes amen my soul is satisfied with things of above for the kingdom of God and his righteousness amen my soul is centered around amen the things of God hallelujah amen praise the Lord so we have to come to build the kingdom of God back on the earth amen how by living righteous iously amen individuals being built into the Power House of the most high God you'll find the prophet says I've come to build powerhouses Tabernacles The Dwelling Place of the most high God am amen what are you doing you are bringing righteousness peace and joy to the Earth amen amen you're a big bundle of joy believe it amen brother Joshua tell them what righteousness peace and joy is what does the Bible say it's the kingdom of God Amen so to bring the kingdom of God on the earth you are bringing righteousness to the Earth you are bring peace to the Earth and you are bringing Joy to the Earth amen hallelujah because you are the only one who is saying Lord let your kingdom come let your will be done you find you going to most churches today they'll only speak about finances they'll speak about money they'll speak about how you must sww into the church how you must give amen they sent to the gospel around Financial blessings when the kingdom of God has come to give you more than just Financial blessings it's come to restore you back to your true identity in Christ amen hallelujah UAH you are the feminine part like Eve was taken from the side of Adam you were taken from the side of Christ amen and he can't reject you in this hour that is why King hesus didn't reject Esther because that was bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she was him amen so he presented to her after the kingdom it presented to her the title deed now the prophet would would detail this you know when you're buying a car if you finance it if you look at the log book most of the time you won't even have the the NS the log book because if you finance it it goes to the bank the bank is the title holder you'll see there's two sections on that form it says title holder an owner right so the proper calls this the abstract title deed where it's traced all the way back to the beginning meaning that the bank doesn't have claim on it before you right only when you finish paying off your Finance when your term has come to an end do they release the log book to you the NS to you then you can go and re-register that thing in your name way it says title holder it has your name and owner it has your name that that's what Christ did amen amen amen prior to that the book of man's inheritance Authority on the earth had a title holder there that was not you you were just under the owner section amen but he says when it's traced all the way back to the beginning because of the blood of Christ amen it erases every past you see you can't sit in the church with condemnation there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus walk after the spirit and not after the flesh amen hallelujah so we can't be living in fear and condemnation Jesus Christ his blood amen the strongest bleach you would call it he raised your past he raised your sin amen amen hallelujah and you are now legal owner of the vehicle you are now legal owner to the Earth because the abstract title deed has come back to you amen so I'm asking you how are you bringing back to glory to the Earth right now by living the word you're taking the word of God in your heart and you are believing the word amen you accepting the word and the supernatural of God is evident in your life amen hallelujah you are living a supernatural life you are not living a carnal life defeated life amen hallelujah there is no situation that can present itself to you where you are in distress where you are in worry and fear there is no situation that can come before you and overtake you thank you sickness was taken care of at the cross thank you Lord amen in fact it was taken care of before the cross because the Bible says by the stripes of Jesus you were healed amen amen hallelujah how many of you know no future illness on you can have an effect on you amen because the blood of Jesus has cleansed you the blood of Jesus has washed you from the curse amen amen some people still believe that the Genesis 3 curse is still over the people how can the Genesis 3 curse have preeminence over the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus came to reverse the curse yes amen so there's nothing in that curse that can come and take control of your life because you are under the blood amen amen can I get a better amen than that amen amen Hallelujah so stop confessing oh because of the Fall because of the Fall I'm in this condition no you find human nature people talk like that hey because of what Adam and Eve did we suffering like this no what about what Jesus did amen say because of what Jesus did I'm living like this because Jesus shed his blood amen because Jesus gave his life for me I am fully restored as a son and daughter of God I don't have to live beneath my means amen Satan wants to keep you down in your Revelation and make you still believe that you under the curse you under that amen hallelujah you have eternal life within your soul we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we are filled with the riches of Christ we are filled with the blessings of Christ amen hallelujah we are not defeated people we are to live our lives amen with the power of God we are to live our lives with the anointing of God Amen we can't be flying around with buzzards we can't be chopping around and jumping around with chickens in the barnyard because we are built differently we are called to s High into the heavenlies we have an eagle anointing we have a prophetic Ministry amen hallelujah to S above Leia hallu amen amen hallelujah I'm not waiting for the Rapture the Rapture is already in progress because he has descended with a shout somebody agree with that he has already descended with a shout amen so the Rapture is already in progress right the shout is a message going forth to prepare people for a Rapture yes now watch very prophetically in the Bible here catch this amen Esther is between two books Esther is talking about amen changing Queen Esther is talking about amen hallelujah saving the lives of people Esther is also talking about how the presence of the king he shut up from there but she alone can bring back the presence amen but it's found in between two books it's found between the book of Nehemiah and you know what happens in Nehemiah March 14th there's a decree given to go and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem yes amen why you go and read nemiah the glory is gone yes so there's a man sent nemiah sent to go and build the walls amen hallelujah but if you watch the book of Nehemiah how it is built it is not a oneman Ministry oh somebody get this it is not a one man Ministry the book of Nehemiah goes into detail and tells you how each family was working on a section of the wall oh somebody get this each family was in consecration working on their section of the wall getting themselves ready for the glory of God to come back to the church amen and next comes the Book of Esther and after the Book of Esther what do you think comes next The Book of Job who prophesies about the Resurrection talking about the Rapture and the resurrection amen amen though he slay me yet in my flesh I shall see my redeemer because I know my redeemer lives somebody give God praise these books are put there in order amen and we see it coming to pass amen amen hallelujah we see the glory of God coming back the walls being rebuilt we see his glory coming back we see the mind of Christ coming into the church to know what he wants done with the word amen because a time and a season like this Eve is now in Satan's Eden and he is coming there amen hallelujah to try and tempt her he's coming in an hour of temptation but I want you to rest ass short eat the book eat the message of the hour it will dissolve all doubt and fears amen it will leave no room for the enemy to work amen you can say it is written it is written it is written when he comes to you and say did God say was the cloud there was this picture there you say it is written it is written amen I don't care what you say about this what your location and this death and the other it is written in Revelation 10 that the mighty Angel shall descend amen our backing is not you remember he says sence took the picture our scripture Our backing is what the word of God we go to the word of God we say Revelation 10 is fulfilled praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah and he's come at this time to take away all unbelief he's come to give you a double portion anointing Elisha yes amen hallelujah you know Elisha is a feminine form of a name too amen I think brother Rish named his daughter Alisha why because there's a feminine part coming amen we'll have a double portion anointing where they connect now it's very important you'll find Ministries I'm saying Ministries I'm talking about you attached to the Ministries as well no ministry will survive in this time and season if they are detached and not connected with the angel of God right yeah that is the key amen think of it now it's how the age started talking about the
