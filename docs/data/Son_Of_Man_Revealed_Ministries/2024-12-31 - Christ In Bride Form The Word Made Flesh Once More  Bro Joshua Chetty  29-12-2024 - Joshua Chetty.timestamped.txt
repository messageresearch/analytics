[4:16] journey through the year the Lord has
[4:18] been Faithfully leading us amen amen
[4:21] taking us into higher dimensions of the
[4:23] Holy Ghost amen amen and one thing about
[4:27] our God is not a backward God he's
[4:30] always forward moving amen he's got a
[4:32] plan he's got a program and he's pushing
[4:35] the church and moving the church amen if
[4:37] the church can only follow the angel of
[4:39] the Lord they will be led in the
[4:41] Supernatural yes amen if they are not
[4:43] following the angel of the Lord they'll
[4:45] be led into dry places into church
[4:48] Theology and church religion amen just
[4:51] settle for a good religion good morals
[4:53] amen but being led by the angel of God
[4:56] must be through a supernatural root amen
[4:59] so the church amen is on the move and we
[5:01] are thankful for what the Lord is doing
[5:03] not only here in Durban South Africa but
[5:05] what he is doing around the world we are
[5:07] seeing a sweeping Global move of the
[5:09] Lord Jesus Christ amen through the Holy
[5:12] Spirit In The Bride of Jesus Christ now
[5:14] is he building the church amen through
[5:16] his word amen that's why he revealed the
[5:18] word amen that's why Seven Seals had to
[5:20] be opened the entire Mysteries of the
[5:23] kingdom of God will revealed to an end
[5:25] time
[5:27] people now we can't place enough value
[5:30] on that that is the ultimate the opening
[5:33] of the word that's what Revelation 10:7
[5:35] was about this Mighty Prophet would come
[5:38] amen and it would be an instrument used
[5:40] that God would reveal the word through
[5:41] him amen so we have all the mysteries of
[5:44] God now opened up to us we have water

[6:32] welcome them this
[6:34] morning amen God bless you brother and I
[6:37] pray amen you'll be blessed this morning
[6:39] even as the word of God is being
[6:40] ministered amen hallelujah you'll find
[6:42] an Abiding Place in your heart to
[6:44] receive the word of God Amen so amen it
[6:47] let us use it as a time as well as we
[6:49] are going down now into the new year and
[6:52] winding up the old year is to track our
[6:54] spiritual journey and our spiritual
[6:57] progress amen
[7:00] uh maybe you are tracking other things
[7:02] in your life how much you made this year
[7:05] amen what you've achieved this year what
[7:08] you managed to buy I ask you sincerely
[7:11] don't reduce the gospel to material
[7:13] things amen that's right amen amen amen
[7:17] it's too precious to be reduced to
[7:19] material
[7:20] things amen I notice there's a there's a
[7:23] trend and a move yes the blessings of
[7:25] God are there but that's not why we were
[7:27] redeemed to buy a better house in a
[7:29] better car and to claim this and receive
[7:31] this that don't reduce God to that now
[7:34] that he called us into the message of
[7:35] the hour to give us things and make our
[7:36] life comfortable you're on the earth
[7:39] remember we at the closing scenes of the
[7:42] Gentile dispensation on amen amen so if
[7:45] anything we ought to be amen getting
[7:48] more
[7:49] urgent the Bible says even as we see the
[7:52] day fast approaching we are to gather
[7:54] more often amen we are to pray amen so
[7:58] if we starting with some basic things
[8:01] let's track our prayer
[8:03] life let's track our Bible reading
[8:06] that's right amen let's track our church
[8:08] attendance let's start with those Basics
[8:11] and see have we been faithful with the
[8:14] little
[8:15] things because God won't Overlook those
[8:18] things you know the prophet of God would
[8:20] teach us if you want to have a Revival
[8:22] he says start to read your Bible and
[8:24] pray every day amen now that's a that's
[8:27] a discipline that must be in still in a
[8:30] Believer we cannot force you to do that
[8:33] if you are interested in your spiritual
[8:35] growth these are the spiritual
[8:36] disciplines you will put in place in
[8:38] your life amen amen I also want to say
[8:42] that we are not having the service
[8:43] earlier to clear up your schedule for
[8:46] the day amen this is the day of worship
[8:50] yes amen amen Sunday is the day of
[8:53] worship amen amen so I just want to say
[8:56] that we are not doing that so that we
[8:58] can uh get Church out the way and have
[9:01] the rest of the day free it's not why
[9:02] we're doing it it's a day of worship in
[9:06] fact if the church calls for another
[9:07] service in the evening all the church
[9:10] should be here amen because it's a day
[9:12] of worship amen the uh the tradition was
[9:17] to gather on a Saturday on the Sabbath
[9:19] amen but when Jesus Christ came he rose
[9:22] on that first day of the
[9:24] week and after that the disciples
[9:27] started to gather on the Sunday amen
[9:30] amen amen in remembrance of the
[9:32] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[9:34] amen amen so it was always considered a
[9:37] day of worship and it also got amen
[9:41] entwined into our
[9:43] culture it's only in in a few years
[9:46] maybe 20 30 years now that they are
[9:48] opening stores on a
[9:50] Sunday prior to that everything would
[9:52] shut
[9:53] down nothing would be opened it was a
[9:56] day consecrated to the Lord for worship
[10:00] so when I ask you now you come into the
[10:02] house of the Lord this morning have you
[10:05] worshiped when the songs were being sung
[10:08] have you worshiped amen when the prayers
[10:10] were being offered amen many people
[10:12] think they're not a part of it when they
[10:13] when the brother is saying let us all
[10:15] Worship the Lord now let us start to
[10:18] pray amen that's your part of the
[10:20] service amen
[10:22] hallelujah so I don't want you to get
[10:25] the impression that I'm trying to make
[10:27] your life comfortable and get church out
[10:29] the way way so that you can do your own
[10:31] things it's a day of
[10:34] worship amen we are doing this because
[10:36] of the
[10:37] weather exclusively because of the
[10:39] weather to make it more comfortable for
[10:42] you to hear the word of God Amen so you
[10:45] know this day of worship was called the
[10:47] day of the
[10:49] Lord amen it's called The Lord's day am
[10:54] and John was caught up in the spirit on
[10:56] the Lord's
[10:57] day amen so he's receiving Revelation on
[11:01] the Lord's
[11:02] day amen so that's how important the
[11:04] Sunday amen this to honor the
[11:06] resurrection of the Lord is is now we
[11:09] are getting caught up in the Lord's day
[11:12] amen so always remember it's a day of
[11:14] worship it's a day of consecration amen
[11:17] once I leave these Church doors I I I
[11:19] can't forget about my
[11:21] Lord amen in fact the holy spirit in you
[11:24] won't make you forget even when you want
[11:27] to go home and you want to put a Netflix
[11:28] on or showx on or you're putting YouTube
[11:31] on the Holy Spirit In You checks you
[11:33] amen and you'd rather listen to a
[11:36] sermon than to indulge in entertainment
[11:39] yes amen amen that's the Holy Spirit now
[11:42] at work the Holy Spirit won't feed on
[11:44] social media and things of those things
[11:47] amen and make you feel comfortable with
[11:49] those things yes yes so that's a good
[11:51] sign to check have I got the Holy Spirit
[11:54] am I feeding on the right things amen am
[11:57] I feeding on the word of God is my heart
[11:59] constantly my mind constantly fixed on
[12:01] the Lord Jesus Christ I pray this
[12:03] morning you will have an experience with
[12:04] the Lord Jesus Christ you may have been
[12:06] in church you may have come to church
[12:08] for a long time but I pray this morning
[12:10] you will definitely have an experience
[12:12] with the Lord Jesus Christ amen that
[12:14] your life will never be the same from
[12:16] today on Amen so just an announcement
[12:18] for Tuesday
[12:20] service amen Tuesday is the 31 right
[12:24] it's our watch Night Service amen our
[12:26] crossover service going into 2025 so
[12:29] we'll start the service shop at 90000
[12:31] p.m. Amen to give you enough time Amen
[12:35] to give you a testimony you know what I
[12:38] found this
[12:40] year that people are not ready for the
[12:42] sons of
[12:44] God you know Romans 8 says all creation
[12:47] is groaning and in travail waiting for
[12:50] the manifestation of the sons of God the
[12:53] same scene that transpired 2,000 years
[12:56] ago is transpiring again people were not
[12:58] ready for the Son of God when Jesus came
[13:02] into the world it's the same condition
[13:04] again now people are not ready for the
[13:07] manifestation of the sons of God amen
[13:10] amen and I tell you I've experienced
[13:12] this so much and I've seen it amen it's
[13:15] like a a rejection of the sons of God
[13:18] when sons are moving in authority and
[13:20] power and the power of God to be
[13:22] displayed people are not ready for it
[13:25] people just want to be left alone with
[13:26] their lives because we're living in a
[13:28] comfortable age
[13:29] they earn enough money they got enough
[13:32] food they got enough
[13:34] clothing so people are not ready for the
[13:37] manifestation of the sons of
[13:41] God do you hear me what I'm saying amen
[13:44] amen people want to have a casual
[13:46] approach to it the only time they want
[13:48] to seek God is when they are sick is
[13:51] when they are going through financial
[13:53] problems that's the only time they look
[13:55] for God but I pray amen that won't be us
[13:58] say Lord try me and search my heart amen
[14:02] yes amen we really want to be Sons and
[14:03] Daughters of God we really want to be
[14:06] amen a part of his economy and a part of
[14:08] his kingdom we don't want to be playing
[14:10] church so we'll start the service at 900
[14:12] p.m. and why I'm saying that you'll find
[14:15] that on W on Tuesday you'll
[14:17] see the Bible says that we ought to be
[14:20] giving praises to God it shouldn't be a
[14:23] forced to fear so if you're really
[14:25] thankful For What the Lord Has Done you
[14:27] come with your testimony you come with
[14:29] Praises you come with your song item
[14:31] amen and you start to Worship the Lord
[14:34] now some of you have already made up
[14:35] your mind you will not
[14:37] testify you will never praise the Lord I
[14:40] ask you to change your mindset amen come
[14:42] and give God praise amen amen if you
[14:45] want to thank anyone for the pasture and
[14:48] how the Lord has had his hand over your
[14:49] life then there's we are giving you the
[14:51] opportunity so we'll start the service
[14:53] at 9:00 p.m. amen the song service will
[14:56] start then we'll go into your amen songs
[14:59] your testimonies amen hallelujah the
[15:01] praise reports and start to reflect and
[15:04] thank the Lord for what he has done amen
[15:07] amen I challenge you if you if you've
[15:11] already determined you're too shy I tell
[15:13] you even write it down and come and give
[15:15] God
[15:17] praise this is not amen just kept for
[15:20] the older people even the young people
[15:22] the Lord may have walked somehow in your
[15:24] life spoken to you amen come and give
[15:27] God praise amen amen owe it to our Lord
[15:29] Jesus Christ to give him praise amen and
[15:32] I pray amen over the the year that we've
[15:34] been preaching even the ministering
[15:36] brothers that have been preaching that
[15:37] somehow amen you have grown spiritually
[15:40] your walk with the Lord has grown amen
[15:42] you have you have learned more about the
[15:44] kingdom of God Amen you've learned about
[15:47] amen the principles of God and how to
[15:48] apply it in your life amen amen amen why
[15:52] am I saying it this way is because you
[15:54] can't go through the first year of
[15:56] college and having gone through that
[15:58] year and then say you didn't achieve
[16:00] anything second year of college third
[16:02] year of college amen so years teaching
[16:06] Holy Ghost
[16:07] teaching how have you applied it to your
[16:10] life and how has it built you
[16:13] up amen if we are if we are just like uh
[16:19] being depleted after the service and
[16:20] then refilling another service something
[16:23] is wrong because the bride in Matthew 25
[16:26] has a reserve tank yes amen there's a
[16:29] continual oil flowing continual word
[16:32] flowing amen so I pray amen that we'll
[16:35] come prepared for that and then amen you
[16:37] know that we generally have Fellowship

[24:17] City amen he's looking for the Eternal
[24:19] promise
[24:21] amen the book of Exodus reading from
[24:24] chapter
[24:26] 24 chapter 24 from verse 12 so just
[24:30] realizing Now it's 12 MTH in the year
[24:34] 2024 and the Lord said unto
[24:37] Moses come up to me into the
[24:42] mount and be there and I will give thee
[24:46] tables of stone and a law and
[24:49] Commandments which I have written amen
[24:52] that thou mayest teach them and Moses
[24:56] rose up and his minister Joshua and
[24:59] Moses went up into the Mount of God and
[25:03] he said unto the elders carry ye year
[25:06] for us until we come again unto you and
[25:10] behold Aaron and her are with you if any
[25:13] man have any matters to do let him come
[25:15] unto
[25:17] them and Moses went up into the mount
[25:20] and a cloud covered the mount and the
[25:22] glory of the Lord Abode upon Mount siai
[25:27] and the cloud covered in six days and
[25:30] the seventh day he called unto Moses out
[25:33] of the midst of the cloud amen it had to
[25:35] be the seven day amen amen in the seven
[25:38] day we know what happened God had to
[25:40] have a prophet amen and he had to be
[25:42] caught up in the mountain there in the
[25:44] cloud amen amen and the sight of the
[25:47] glory of the Lord was like devouring
[25:50] fire on the top of the mount in the eyes
[25:53] of the children of Israel and Moses went
[25:56] into the midst of the cloud didn't we
[25:58] have Propet that went into the mid of
[25:59] the cloud and get up into the Mounds and
[26:03] Moses was in the mount 40 days and 40
[26:07] nights amen you may be
[26:09] seated where we proceed we also turn to
[26:12] the Book of Exodus 25
[26:44] Exodus
[26:54] 25 and the Lord spoke spake unto Moses
[26:57] saying Speak unto the children children
[26:58] of Israel that they bring me an offering
[27:01] of every man that giveth it willingly
[27:03] with his heart he shall take my offering
[27:06] oh he and this is the offering which
[27:08] they shall take of them gold and silver
[27:09] and brass and blue and purple and
[27:12] Scarlet and fine linen and goats and RAM
[27:15] Sky skins dyed red and badges skin and
[27:18] shittam wood all for the light spices
[27:21] for anointing oil and for sweet incense
[27:24] ir ston and stones to be set in a heid
[27:26] and in the breastplate and and let them
[27:28] make me a sanctuary that I may dwell
[27:32] among them amen so here's the Lord's
[27:36] desire now he wants to make this uh
[27:39] Tabernacle that he may come and dwell
[27:41] amongst men amen amen but remember now
[27:44] he's not this is under the blood of bull
[27:46] and goats yeah he can't dwell in man but
[27:50] he has to dwell in a sanctuary in a holy
[27:52] place where now he can be amongst the
[27:56] people amen amen but that wasn't God's
[27:59] ultimate desire God don't want to just
[28:02] be amongst the people amen God want to
[28:04] be in the people
[28:07] amen so we also look
[28:10] at Exodus 34:
[28:14] 1-5 and the Lord said unto Moses you use
[28:17] the two tables of stone like unto the
[28:19] first and I will write upon these tables
[28:22] the words that were in the first table
[28:23] which thou break us you know what
[28:25] happened there because after Moses
[28:27] received uh uh the tables uh the
[28:31] Commandments and he went to the people
[28:33] they was in disarray and they were
[28:36] worshiping this Idol and so forth and
[28:38] then
[28:39] Moses vexed in his Spirit had to break
[28:41] the stone but now this is the second
[28:43] time now and so and and the Lord said to
[28:46] him and be ready in the morning and come
[28:48] up in the morning unto Mount saai and
[28:50] present thyself there to me in the top
[28:53] of the mount and no man shall come up
[28:56] with thee neither let any any man be
[28:58] seen throughout all the mount neither
[29:00] let the flocks nor herds feed before the
[29:04] mount and he h two tables of stone like
[29:07] unto the first and Moses rose up early
[29:09] in the morning and went up unto Mount
[29:10] siai as the Lord had commanded him and
[29:13] took in his hand the two tables of stone
[29:16] and the Lord descended in the cloud and
[29:18] stood with him there and proclaimed the
[29:20] name of the Lord amen
[29:23] amen also very quickly we'll go to
[29:25] Second Corinthians
[29:28] Chapter
[29:31] 3 The Book of 2 Corinthians CH 3: 2 to8
[29:35] Paul is saying Ye Ye are our Epistles
[29:38] written in our Arts known and read of
[29:41] all men for as much as they are
[29:45] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[29:48] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[29:52] ink yeah Paul is taking them to the
[29:55] Revelation amen that they are no no
[29:58] longer people that something to be
[30:00] written about amen but you are now a
[30:03] manifestation of what's written Amen in
[30:06] the days of Moses God was hiding behind
[30:09] bad of skin amen and there it was
[30:12] written the the word of God was put on
[30:15] tables of stone am amen but now it's
[30:18] written in as to be written now in the
[30:20] hearts of men amen amen and now the word
[30:23] of God now must come and it must come
[30:26] into the spirit of God must come into
[30:28] the hearts of men so men will walk out
[30:30] as the Living World amen
[30:33] amen but with the spirit of the Living
[30:35] God not in tables of stone but in
[30:37] fleshly tables of the
[30:39] hearts and as such trust have we through
[30:44] Christ to God word not that we are
[30:47] sufficient of ourself to think anything
[30:49] is of ourself but our sufficiency is of
[30:52] God Amen yes so we not relying upon
[30:55] ourselves that's why he said to Paul my
[30:58] grace is sufficient for thee if we rely
[31:00] upon any good of ourselves we are going
[31:03] to go backwards amen but we have to rely
[31:06] on the perfect work of Jesus Christ am
[31:08] and we got to submit to him we got to
[31:11] surrender to him that he now can dwell
[31:14] in the sanctuaries amen into this
[31:16] Tabernacle of Flesh amen who also had
[31:19] made us able Ministers of the New
[31:22] Testament not of the letter but of the
[31:26] spirits amen for the letter kill it but
[31:29] the spirit give it life people like to
[31:32] keep going back to the letter amen they
[31:35] like to go back to the written word
[31:37] which is important but it's not good to
[31:39] have just the written word without the
[31:42] spirit yes because the spirit will take
[31:44] the word and make it become projects it
[31:47] through your life amen if you got the
[31:49] same spirit that dwelt in Jesus if that
[31:51] spirit dwelt in you then that spirit
[31:54] makes that word manifested through your
[31:56] life amen that's you become the living
[31:58] Apostles read and known of all men amen
[32:02] at once it was written Apostles but now
[32:04] you have to become the Lively Stones you
[32:07] have to become the the living Apostles
[32:09] amen amenl amen but if the ministration
[32:14] of death written and engraved in Stones
[32:16] was
[32:17] glorious so that the children of Israel
[32:20] could not steadfastly behold the face of
[32:23] Moses for the glory of his countenance
[32:26] which Glory as to be done away now look
[32:29] at that a chary glory but it was so
[32:31] powerful that Moses had to Veil his face
[32:35] because of the Contin of the glory of
[32:36] God yes how much more powerful it is now
[32:40] when God is dwelling in you and I amen
[32:43] which is it's very easy to believe that
[32:44] God was dwelling in Moses it's easy to
[32:47] believe that God came and manifested
[32:48] himself 2,000 years ago in human flesh
[32:51] but once more Amen in a many member body
[32:55] amen amen he must come again and
[32:57] manifest
[32:59] himself amen because if if it doesn't
[33:02] happen again that Jesus death was in
[33:05] vain amen but I tell you something Jesus
[33:08] death was not in vain God had his
[33:10] purpose God had his great purpose in the
[33:13] back part of his mind amen amen and had
[33:15] to achieve that purpose yes bring back
[33:17] man to his original condition amen
[33:21] amen so you see that how shall not the
[33:25] ministration of the spirit be rather
[33:28] glorious for if the ministration of
[33:30] condemnation be glory much more do the
[33:34] ministration of righteousness exceed in
[33:38] glory because the law condemned them
[33:40] right but now under righteousness we
[33:42] have no condemnation because we have
[33:44] received the message of our day if you
[33:47] didn't receive the message of our day
[33:48] you are in condemnation but when you
[33:50] receive the message that is given to you
[33:52] in this day there is now therefore no
[33:54] condemnation because when he when he
[33:56] comes down as a Mighty angel in
[33:58] Revelation 10:1 amen he comes down his
[34:01] judgment to the world but he comes down
[34:04] while there's an Earthly Angel
[34:05] Revelation 10:7 and those that will
[34:08] accept the message of the Earthly Angel
[34:11] Revelation 10:7 they now are know not in
[34:14] condemnation because that is pertaining
[34:17] to us which is revelation 108 to1 amen
[34:20] am amen
[34:23] amen for even that which was made
[34:26] glorious had no glory in this Respect by
[34:29] reason of the glory that excelth for if
[34:32] that which is done away was glorious
[34:34] much more that which remain is
[34:38] glorious yes seeing then that we have
[34:42] such hope we use great plainness of
[34:47] speech and that as Moses which put a
[34:49] veil over his face that the children of
[34:52] Israel could not steadfastly look to the
[34:54] end of that which is abolished but their
[34:57] Minds were blinded for until this day
[35:00] remained the same Veil untaken away in
[35:03] the reading of the Old Testament which
[35:05] Veil is done away in Christ but even
[35:08] unto this day when Moses is read the
[35:11] veil is upon their hearts nevertheless
[35:14] when it shall turn to the Lord the veil
[35:17] shall be taken away amen the Lord
[35:19] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[35:21] shouts am amen that's the time when the
[35:24] veil shall be taken away amen but those
[35:27] that don't come under this messenger of
[35:29] Malachi 4 those that don't receive the
[35:31] message under Revelation 10:7 the ve is
[35:33] still still there amen amen that's right
[35:37] but we all would open face beholding as
[35:41] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[35:44] changed into the same image from glory
[35:47] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[35:51] Lord
[35:52] amen so you are also climbing up into
[35:55] this mountain amen into this spirit
[35:57] Mountain into the seven step of
[35:59] perfection amen amen because why you're
[36:02] climbing up to to come and be kept with
[36:04] the edstone amen amen amen because why
[36:09] you are uniting with the headstone amen
[36:13] that's why he said to the prophet I'll
[36:14] meet you in there amen that is not a
[36:17] public show amen that is when you come
[36:19] into a union with him that is Christ and
[36:22] the bride becoming one becoming one unit
[36:26] amen amen and get now Christ coming to
[36:29] dwell in the heart of man amen making it
[36:32] now amen a place where it is now sorry
[36:36] can I take this out are we using
[36:45] this amen so now Christ is now dwelling
[36:48] in the soul
[36:51] amen so we speaking this morning Christ
[36:54] in bright form the word made flesh once
[36:58] more amen amen you believe that amen
[37:02] it's the word made flesh once more yes
[37:05] amen amen there's a purpose why Jesus
[37:07] came 2,000 years ago amen amen that
[37:10] purpose was not to remain a baby in the
[37:12] manger
[37:15] yes that purpose was to bring a people
[37:19] yes as
[37:21] God was in flesh the word was made flesh
[37:25] so there must be a people where the word
[37:28] must be made flesh again amen and that
[37:32] was done as a type in this day in Son of
[37:34] Man Ministry amen but he didn't remain
[37:37] there amen because why God was God had a
[37:41] purpose that was just to show you that
[37:42] that was a type amen you know in
[37:45] everything that you make there must be a
[37:46] prototype amen but from that from that
[37:49] one that is made now they must be IDs
[37:52] that will come forth amen amen and they
[37:55] have been types and types and Shadow
[37:58] all to the Bible but there must be the
[38:00] perfect type amen there must be the end
[38:02] result amen there must be an end result
[38:04] where once again the word must be made
[38:07] flesh amen and now it is Christ in
[38:09] bright form in a many membered body amen
[38:16] amen so we find the word brought by a
[38:19] mighty angel in his day Revelation 101
[38:23] it can it could only
[38:24] come to revelation 10:7
[38:28] he couldn't go to any school or seminary
[38:30] he couldn't go to any other religious
[38:32] organization it had to come to a prophet
[38:35] because there's no greater order that
[38:36] the word of the Lord will come through
[38:38] amen God have given could have given it
[38:40] to Angels but this greatest order he
[38:42] said surely the Lord God will do nothing
[38:44] but reveal his secrets to his servants
[38:46] the prophets amen amen Amos 3:7 so it
[38:50] had to come through a prophets and those
[38:53] that will receive this prophet's message
[38:55] amen have the right now oh to become the
[38:58] M piece of God am they have the right
[39:00] now amen to become the ones that have
[39:03] went now that can climb up to the Mount
[39:06] of God where the glory of God can be
[39:08] shown through them amen
[39:11] amen so you find that the glory is shown
[39:14] being shown through this bride now amen
[39:17] but it's still it's you can see it but
[39:19] it's veil to the world
[39:24] Amen so we find that this world has made
[39:27] woman the god of the evil age Satan is
[39:31] the god of the evil age but woman has
[39:33] become their God Amen because they put
[39:35] woman on a ey pedestal yes they always
[39:37] esteem woman highest Amen in everything
[39:41] you see woman is become worshiped yes
[39:45] but there will also be a woman a proper
[39:47] woman amen because everything Satan does
[39:50] is pervert what God had his an original
[39:53] plan there's a woman who be God too amen
[39:57] hallelujah amen they can make woman the
[39:59] god they God but there'll also be a
[40:02] woman who be God because God will be in
[40:05] her amen and it w be us speaking it be
[40:07] God speaking through her it w be her
[40:10] body moving it be God working through
[40:11] her
[40:12] amen because God must work Christ came
[40:16] 2,000 years ago but now he's got a body
[40:19] amen he's got a body that he's using now
[40:21] he's got a body who who is the
[40:23] instrument for him amen who's fulfilling
[40:25] his purpose and our purpose is to
[40:27] fulfill God's mandate amen so this woman
[40:30] is moving and this woman will be God
[40:32] upon the Earth amen amen so if she is
[40:35] God upon the Earth where's The Mercy
[40:36] Seat amen The Mercy Seat has to be
[40:38] dwelling now in a many membered body
[40:41] amen The Mercy Seat of God Amen because
[40:44] why she's grace to the Earth the fact
[40:46] that she's still on the earth the Holy
[40:48] Ghost is still here amen the Holy Ghost
[40:51] will only go when she leaves the Earth
[40:54] the doors when the doors are shut the
[40:56] doors become shut to the Gentile
[40:58] dispensation when the bride leaves the
[41:00] Earth amen but until then the mercy seat
[41:04] is in the bride amen The Mercy Seat is
[41:06] in a many membered
[41:08] body
[41:10] amen can I read that quote
[41:39] he says now is the day of Mercy now
[41:43] let's come back let's go back in the Old
[41:45] Testament here just a little bit and
[41:47] find out what Mercy is go on back and
[41:49] see what happened to the stone the
[41:51] Throne of course is the Judgment seat
[41:54] and the reason today that there is Mercy
[41:56] is because The Mercy Seat is sprinkled
[41:59] with an atonement blood and as long as
[42:01] blood is on the Judgment seat then it is
[42:03] not judgment no more it's Mercy because
[42:06] something died to stay judgment if you
[42:09] see it say Amen as long as blood is on
[42:13] The Mercy Seat show that something died
[42:16] to hold judgment back but when the
[42:19] church is raptured The Mercy Seat
[42:23] becomes a judgment seat amen amen so the
[42:28] fact that the bride is on the earth
[42:30] Mercy seed is still on the earth amen
[42:32] amen
[42:33] amen but when she is raptured The Mercy
[42:37] Seat becomes a judgment seat amen amen
[42:41] so if the bride is carrying the mercies
[42:44] of God what Ministry do we have
[42:54] amen he says
[42:58] God became man he had to become kin
[43:02] folks and he couldn't be God and us
[43:06] sinners creations of his creation
[43:09] creative beings of his creation CA we
[43:13] couldn't be kin folks there so God
[43:16] became man that man might become God
[43:19] Amen yes God's purpose amen amen that
[43:23] man might become God yes amen amen amen
[43:28] we being men Sinners God became a sinner
[43:32] took our sins upon him knowing no sins
[43:35] yet was a sinner because our sins was
[43:38] placed upon him yes he become me that I
[43:43] might become him amen amen he become a
[43:46] sinner that I might become a Son of God
[43:49] hallelujah he become a sinner that you
[43:52] might become a Son of God and now we are
[43:55] Sons and Daughters of God God Amen
[43:58] because God was made kin folks and we
[44:01] and he took on the form of our flesh was
[44:05] born of a woman not another person God
[44:09] himself amen now if we took a form of
[44:11] our flesh then we are taking his form
[44:14] which is the word amen we are coming
[44:16] back to the word image amen amen he took
[44:19] our form so we can come into His form
[44:21] amen do you get that amen so the only
[44:24] way you can do that now is to come into
[44:26] a union with
[44:28] yes 1 Timothy 3:16 said without
[44:31] controversy great is the mystery of
[44:34] godliness for God was manifested in the
[44:36] flesh Amen in the beginning was the word
[44:39] and the Word was with God and the Word
[44:41] was God and the Word was made flesh amen
[44:45] and the word made human being become a
[44:48] Kinsman he become a man oh he become
[44:52] death that through his death I might
[44:54] become life am he become a sinner that
[44:58] through his righteousness I might have
[45:01] become life he become poor that I
[45:04] through his poverty I might be made Rich
[45:07] he become what I was so that so that I
[45:10] might through his grace become what he
[45:13] is amen
[45:16] amen then talk about powers of God now
[45:19] that's exactly the scripture and that's
[45:21] what the scripture says that we might be

[51:12] amen amen that's the gateway to receive
[51:14] the title deed
[51:17] amen
[51:19] amen that's why John couldn't worship
[51:22] him because he said I am like your
[51:24] fellow brother and the prophet because
[51:26] why John was typing the bride amen and
[51:29] what he were seeing the prophet who
[51:31] brought the message of the hour Amen to
[51:33] come to a people amen because title deed
[51:36] has been restored in this hour amen
[51:38] that's why the prophet could go and
[51:40] preach up to Revelation 10 1-7 and left
[51:43] out each part the other part out because
[51:45] the other part has to be spoken by the M
[51:48] piece of God in this hour the one that
[51:50] become where the messenger and the
[51:52] message becomes one the one that has
[51:54] come receive the message of the day amen
[51:56] and the one had to say where they become
[51:58] the final voice they are the right now
[52:01] to take that scripture and say thou must
[52:04] prophesy again Hallelujah because why
[52:06] it's revealed to them amen the title de
[52:08] has been revealed to them the names in
[52:09] the book have been revealed to them the
[52:11] full Plan of Redemption has been
[52:13] restored back to
[52:15] them amen
[52:18] amen so God has taken what is done the
[52:21] stone that was word which was the word
[52:25] written on the stone and put in the ark
[52:27] behind bad of skin because that was that
[52:30] what was what was written the stone it
[52:31] was the word of God but it was in
[52:34] written form but it was written in stone
[52:37] amen now it was also put behind Bader
[52:40] skin not human skin yes
[52:43] amen but your
[52:47] heart amen inside of our heart it
[52:50] changed that's why you to say he took
[52:52] our Stony art and given us the heartart
[52:53] of Flesh amen because first you had to
[52:56] do transformation of that he had to
[52:58] change take our the the the way we
[53:01] thought the way we think about things
[53:03] the way we were uh because we are born
[53:06] under Flesh and Blood Amen in flesh and
[53:09] we are born out of sin amen come into
[53:11] the world speaking lives but you to CH
[53:14] change our heart of Flesh of stone to
[53:17] make it a heart of Flesh amen where we
[53:19] can receive him amen so behind your
[53:22] flesh and the spirit ministering there
[53:24] we find that God when when comes down
[53:27] there now he's be able to bring his word
[53:29] in us and we can say Amen to that word
[53:32] amen you might be thinking I'm just a
[53:34] normal person in the church I'm not a
[53:36] preacher I'm not in the fivefold
[53:38] ministry there was a sister called etes
[53:41] amen amen who could amen that word amen
[53:45] amen and then she could have whatsoever
[53:47] she desired because she had the right
[53:51] she created the right atmosphere in the
[53:52] house and she could receive that word
[53:55] and she could amen that word Hallelujah
[53:57] so when you receive that word when the
[53:59] world is rejecting the word when Jesus
[54:00] Christ is rejected once again who is
[54:04] Jesus the word amen rejected once again
[54:07] and when he's rejected once again you
[54:08] are receiving that word hallelujah but
[54:11] once again when you are are presenting
[54:14] yourself as the ambassador of Jesus
[54:17] Christ don't think you'll be accepted
[54:20] because you must take up your cross and
[54:21] follow him amen if Jesus was rejected so
[54:25] must you be rejected
[54:27] if you can to have everyone being very
[54:28] nice your family is being nice to you
[54:30] your friends being nice to you then
[54:31] there's something wrong if they don't
[54:33] see something different about your life
[54:35] yeah if they don't take you if they
[54:36] don't see I don't I don't mean that
[54:38] you're a mean person what I mean is if
[54:40] they don't see that you took a stand for
[54:42] the word amen because watch the
[54:45] difference watch the demons then when
[54:47] you take a stand for the word right yeah
[54:50] what the people that you think are your
[54:51] friends what the people that you think
[54:53] you are are your families watch when you
[54:55] take a stand for the truth then you'll
[54:58] see the other side that's right then
[55:01] when you have to have discernment and
[55:02] see demon Spirits dwelling in man just
[55:06] like our God is dwelling now in a many
[55:08] membered body demon Spirits are also
[55:10] dwelling in man yeah amen and the same
[55:13] demons that were in the people that
[55:15] rejected Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago
[55:18] must and the same ones that rejected the
[55:20] word when the prophet was preaching it
[55:22] did everything they could
[55:27] to to come against the prophets even the
[55:30] 400 ministers Tred to come against the
[55:33] ministry and all these things when
[55:35] you're coming against the word and all
[55:38] the hardship that his Prophet had to go
[55:40] through right that he took get in the
[55:42] end and we know what really happened
[55:44] there but we know that the word had to
[55:47] come forth nothing can stop the word
[55:50] from coming forth amen it was there
[55:52] preserved amen for a people amen and
[55:56] when his word has come forth it wasn't
[55:58] just a normal word it was a word that
[56:00] come with sweat amen with Blood Sweat
[56:03] and Tears amen a word that's come with
[56:05] Blood Sweat and Tears and we cannot be
[56:08] now in our comfort zones accepting this
[56:10] word this is not an ordinary word amen
[56:13] this is the word that is where God is
[56:15] saying now I become you amen I've taken
[56:18] your place right a thousand years ago I
[56:21] done the work of redemption for you that
[56:22] you can become me you have a purpose
[56:26] amen don't sh from your responsibility
[56:29] your responsibility is to be my body
[56:32] upon the Earth amen amen amen so if you
[56:36] are my body on the earth The Works that
[56:38] I did must you do also John 1412 huj and
[56:42] Greater Works than this ye shall do amen
[56:45] because now it can be done in more in a
[56:47] more measurable way because why it's in
[56:49] a many membered body just like the time
[56:52] when Moses got tired and his
[56:54] father-in-law said you know what you man
[56:56] one man can't do this alone you tie
[56:58] yourself out and then Moses had to
[57:00] transfer the gift to 70 other men so
[57:03] just like that it's just not a greater
[57:05] gift than Moses but just that more
[57:07] people now using the gift so just like
[57:10] that more people now taking out the
[57:12] works of Christ amen so the same works
[57:15] you have to measure the spirit amen The
[57:17] Same Spirit that was in Christ is
[57:19] dwelling in you that he must do the same
[57:21] works if that same spirit that was there
[57:24] in the apostles and he wrote book of
[57:26] Acts then this bride of Christ must
[57:29] write another book of Acts amen amen
[57:34] amen so you find
[57:39] that this is the hour
[57:43] where God must have man and woman on the
[57:47] earth where they will have dominion
[57:49] again amen all that they lost they must
[57:53] have dominion again it must be seen CH
[57:56] in flesh again amen you can't see
[57:58] yourself as an ordinary person amen you
[58:02] know we've got our sisters that dress up
[58:06] in a way that the world don't dress up
[58:08] they wear their hair the the world
[58:10] doesn't do it but if you sisters
[58:11] thinking is just done out of tradition
[58:14] or just to say no I want to be a holy
[58:17] person then there's something wrong but
[58:18] if you got a revelation of why you do it
[58:20] amen that you have show that you are a
[58:23] daughter of God that your values are
[58:26] different from the values of the earth
[58:28] if you got a revelation of that then
[58:30] that becomes a
[58:31] testimony that becomes a living apostal
[58:34] great know of all men and your men that
[58:36] conduct yourself differently is showing
[58:38] that we are different people on the
[58:39] Earth amen
[58:45] amen amen you have to recognize that you
[58:47] are the word of the hour amen that you
[58:50] are the word made flesh in this hour am
[58:54] you got to recognize your part of the
[58:55] scripture
[58:57] Jesus could walk in perfect faith when
[58:59] he took his part and he saw himself in
[59:01] the scripture and took the scriptures
[59:03] that pertain to himself William Brandon
[59:05] did the same thing the prophet of God
[59:07] took the scripture that pertained to him
[59:09] and saw himself in the word amen you can
[59:12] fulfill that by seeing yourself in the
[59:14] scripture and when you see yourself in
[59:16] the word you pray back God the word
[59:19] amen amen amen did Moses do that he take
[59:23] took God back to his own word when God
[59:25] wanted to told when God was W was so
[59:28] angry with the people of what they have
[59:29] done making this cough and so forth he
[59:32] wanted to destroy
[59:33] them and Moses is reminding god of the
[59:36] promises he made yes to Abraham Isaac
[59:40] amen and Jacob amen amen he's taking God
[59:44] back to his word amen so if you want
[59:47] anything on God take God back to his
[59:48] word amen God is obligated to his word
[59:52] amen he's not obligated to your feelings
[59:54] your emotions he's obligated to his
[59:56] word therefore you find that you know
[59:59] sometimes you get sometime you go and
[1:00:01] pray for you got a situation where you
[1:00:04] got financial problems or you got
[1:00:06] sickness upon you the first thing you do
[1:00:08] you want sympathy but take it to the
[1:00:11] word amen get your emotions out of the
[1:00:13] way yes sir amen that's right take the
[1:00:16] word amen leave your emotions your
[1:00:19] emotions can't help you what's done is
[1:00:21] done you are in a situation now you are
[1:00:24] in a crisis tion is your emotions is
[1:00:27] going to make the situation worse amen
[1:00:30] amen your your senses are your five
[1:00:32] senses and all the things that you feel
[1:00:34] taste smell he all is going to make it
[1:00:36] worse amen take the word of God Amen
[1:00:40] take the promises of God because it is
[1:00:43] yay and amen amen the promises of God
[1:00:46] can never fail it's the same yesterday
[1:00:49] today and forever am
[1:00:57] amen so we find that our life must be a
[1:01:00] sign amen when you're telling the people
[1:01:03] the people might misunderstand
[1:01:05] you don't be don't be faced by that tell
[1:01:08] them who you are that you are a son and
[1:01:10] daughter of God
[1:01:11] [Music]
[1:01:13] Amen tell them in the hour because you
[1:01:16] know for too long you're telling the
[1:01:17] people I'm just going to church I'm just
[1:01:19] a Christian I'm just going to church and
[1:01:22] they know you as a Christian tell them
[1:01:23] who you are that you a son and da
[1:01:25] daughter of God Amen that you have
[1:01:28] received a message in this day that will
[1:01:29] give you rapturing Faith amen that you
[1:01:31] received a word that come through a
[1:01:33] prophet according to the scripture sir
[1:01:36] amen and this word makes me different
[1:01:38] amen amen because why what makes you now
[1:01:41] rewrite the book of Acts because you
[1:01:44] come through the Water Way straight is
[1:01:45] the gates s t r a i g s r s t r a i t
[1:01:53] amen straights not the other straight G
[1:01:55] h t but AIT straight which is the
[1:01:59] Waterway amen yeah and you come through
[1:02:01] the Waterway to the true baptism when
[1:02:03] Jesus said go into all the world
[1:02:05] preaching the gospel baptize them in the
[1:02:07] name of the father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:02:09] watch The Water Way in the book of Acts
[1:02:11] 238 is opening up repent every one of
[1:02:13] you be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:02:15] Jesus Christ and ye shall receive the
[1:02:17] gift of the Holy Ghost amen amen so you
[1:02:20] come that way that unlocks now the book
[1:02:23] of Acts to you amen amen
[1:02:26] and when you come the right way
[1:02:28] receiving the message of the hour then
[1:02:29] it unlocks the Holy Ghost amen and the
[1:02:32] Holy Ghost can come now and work in your
[1:02:34] life yes the Holy Ghost is locked up
[1:02:36] don't let the people think tell you they
[1:02:38] got the Holy Ghost they got the gifts of
[1:02:40] the Spirit but the Holy Ghost himself
[1:02:43] amen they can't receive the Holy Ghost
[1:02:45] nobody has the Holy Ghost outside the
[1:02:47] message of the hour amen don't let the
[1:02:50] people come and tell you I'm born again
[1:02:52] I got the Holy Ghost yeah no one has the
[1:02:55] Holy Ghost goes outside the message of
[1:02:56] the hour amen amen because they didn't
[1:02:58] come on the right way amen so all the
[1:03:01] people out there they claim to have the
[1:03:03] Holy Ghost do not have the Holy Ghost
[1:03:05] it's only the ones where God is
[1:03:07] manifested now in human flesh yes Christ
[1:03:10] in bright form hall because she is
[1:03:12] carrying the Holy Ghost she was the one
[1:03:14] who said be unto me according to Thy
[1:03:17] word amen she was the Virgin bride amen
[1:03:20] amen she was the chosen one the
[1:03:21] predestinated one amen when she received
[1:03:24] an angel's message she received it yes
[1:03:27] she didn't question it yes hallelujah
[1:03:29] amen when she received the angel message
[1:03:31] she received it amen amen but then she
[1:03:33] didn't remain in that condition just
[1:03:35] receiving the word no the Holy Ghost had
[1:03:37] to overshadow her yes amen and then she
[1:03:40] had to come to a time of conception when
[1:03:42] she received it but from the conception
[1:03:44] she went on a journey she went on a 9
[1:03:46] month Journey amen amen until the time
[1:03:49] she had to give birth to the Holy One
[1:03:52] amen so now what was hidden name there
[1:03:56] all these years is no longer hidden it's
[1:03:59] now being manifested amen so when you
[1:04:02] receive this word all the years it was
[1:04:04] hidden you were receiving and receiving
[1:04:05] the mechanics oh but it's the hour of
[1:04:07] the Dynamics amen amen this is the hour
[1:04:10] of the Dynamics it cannot be hidden
[1:04:11] anymore because why it was in seed form
[1:04:13] you received it but now in Fruit form
[1:04:16] amen it has to be shown forth that's
[1:04:19] right amen that is why now is the time
[1:04:22] you must prophesy again amen
[1:04:26] there was a time you received but now is
[1:04:28] a time where it's being manifested amen
[1:04:36] amen so we find
[1:04:39] that look at some scripture John 114
[1:04:42] says and the Word was made flesh and
[1:04:44] dwelt amongst
[1:04:45] us the word that we received yeah it's
[1:04:48] easy to take that scripture and pointed
[1:04:50] back 2,000 years ago and the Word was
[1:04:52] made flesh but it is easy to receive
[1:04:55] that the word now that you received in
[1:04:57] this hour is made
[1:04:59] flesh you receive the word in this day
[1:05:02] is it made flesh amen yeah do you see
[1:05:06] yourself as that word that you received
[1:05:08] is now flesh amen or do you see your
[1:05:11] brother and sister you say no that
[1:05:13] brother I know him from there he's here
[1:05:15] oh do you see that's the word made
[1:05:19] flesh do you see Jehovah walking in two
[1:05:21] feets

[1:05:51] the
[1:05:53] earth the word made flesh in this
[1:05:57] hour Ephesians 5:27 say that he might
[1:06:00] present it to himself
[1:06:02] amen a glorious
[1:06:06] church not having spot or wrinkle that's
[1:06:10] right or any such thing but that it
[1:06:12] should be holy and without blemish how
[1:06:15] can it be holy when it's because his
[1:06:17] holy ghost is in dwelling in you amen
[1:06:20] the holy God in a people so it's the act
[1:06:24] of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:26] that wrote the book of Acts the the acts
[1:06:29] of the Holy Ghost in the people amen the
[1:06:32] acts of the Holy Ghost In You amen
[1:06:34] Christ speaking through you Christ
[1:06:36] working through you Christ Healing The
[1:06:38] Sick through you
[1:06:39] amen Revelation 197 let us be glad and
[1:06:43] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:06:45] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[1:06:47] wife had made herself
[1:06:49] ready amen because why Matthew 25 what
[1:06:53] what what Matthew 25 says the ones that
[1:06:56] went to take the lamp that that oil in
[1:06:58] the lamp
[1:06:59] amen 25 says then shall the Kingdom of
[1:07:02] Heaven be likened un 10 virgins which
[1:07:05] took the Lambs and went forth to meet
[1:07:06] the
[1:07:07] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[1:07:09] and five were foolish they that were
[1:07:12] wise took their lambs and took no oil
[1:07:14] with
[1:07:15] them but we but the wise took oil in
[1:07:19] their lambs with their sorry in their
[1:07:22] vessels with their
[1:07:24] lambs while the bridegroom tered they
[1:07:27] all slumbered and slept and at midnight
[1:07:29] there was a cry made behold the
[1:07:31] bridegroom come go you out to meet him
[1:07:34] and all those virgins arose and Trimm
[1:07:36] their lambs and the foolish said unto
[1:07:38] the wise give us of your oil for our
[1:07:40] Lambs are gone out but this wise the
[1:07:43] wise answered saying not so lest there
[1:07:45] be not enough for us and you but go ye
[1:07:48] rather to them that sell and buy for
[1:07:52] yourselves and while they went to buy
[1:07:54] the bridegroom came came and they that
[1:07:56] were ready went in with him to the
[1:07:58] marriage and the door was
[1:08:01] shut so you
[1:08:05] see those that would go and be one with
[1:08:10] him Unite with him amen so right now
[1:08:13] although there was an invisible Union
[1:08:15] taking place it was invisible the world
[1:08:17] didn't see it but what becomes visible
[1:08:21] about it is the manifestation of the
[1:08:23] Union amen yes if there was a union
[1:08:26] taking place when we received the
[1:08:29] word the the the union between Christ
[1:08:32] and his bride the bride and the
[1:08:33] bridegroom it was an invisible
[1:08:36] Union but there must be a manifestation
[1:08:39] of what took
[1:08:41] place if the union had to have a
[1:08:44] conception and it had to reproduce Jesus
[1:08:47] Christ again so there must be a
[1:08:50] manifestation at one stage it was
[1:08:52] Private it was a private Union it was in
[1:08:55] invisible it was invisible to the world
[1:08:58] but what took place behind closed doors
[1:09:01] must be shown now in the
[1:09:03] open amen when this bride is fully
[1:09:06] manifesting Jesus Christ upon the Earth
[1:09:09] there must be an hour where she fully
[1:09:11] manifest Christ cuz she had the oil in
[1:09:14] the lamp amen she had an over overflow
[1:09:17] of oil which is the Holy Ghost that's
[1:09:19] right and if she got an overflow of the
[1:09:21] Holy Ghost it must be known amen it must
[1:09:24] be seen must be manifested
[1:09:27] amen because the very works that Jesus
[1:09:30] did you must do
[1:09:34] amen he come to reproduce himself that's
[1:09:37] what he come to do he has to reproduce
[1:09:39] himself again amen yes amen amen now
[1:09:43] that's what the invisible Union was
[1:09:45] about to come under a
[1:09:47] union and the others wouldn't come into
[1:09:49] Union with him
[1:09:56] so the prophet of God always say she is
[1:09:58] him in bright form amen the word made
[1:10:02] manifest in her she is a continuation of
[1:10:05] Christ Ministry on
[1:10:09] Earth just as Christ was veiled in human
[1:10:12] flesh the bride is veiled in human
[1:10:16] vessels but in his life it is his life
[1:10:20] his spirit and his word expressing
[1:10:23] itself themselves through her
[1:10:26] amen not your spirit his Spirit now you
[1:10:29] are submitting to him you are saying I
[1:10:31] die to Christ I I must die so that
[1:10:33] Christ can live in me amen you die to
[1:10:36] self you die to that old nature amen yes
[1:10:39] you become a prisoner of Christ so his
[1:10:41] life his spirit and his word must
[1:10:44] Express itself through you amen yes amen
[1:10:48] amen
[1:10:50] amen Ephesians 5:30 says for we are
[1:10:53] members of his body of his flesh of his
[1:10:56] bones amen the bride is not separate
[1:11:00] from
[1:11:01] Christ she is him in another
[1:11:04] form he just changed this form
[1:11:08] amen she's not a separate because that
[1:11:10] is why for you to become bride firstly
[1:11:13] the gene of God had to be in you amen
[1:11:16] amen you had to have representation when
[1:11:18] you receive the message there to be a
[1:11:20] deep calling to the Deep yes amen so we
[1:11:24] find that
[1:11:26] you are just it's just Christ in a
[1:11:28] different form now Christ was manifested
[1:11:30] in the son of man in in the days of
[1:11:33] William brandham that's good to show
[1:11:35] that but now it's hard for people to see
[1:11:37] now Christ is manifested in a different
[1:11:39] form which is the bright form it's easy
[1:11:42] to talk about any other Ministry but
[1:11:45] when it comes to the time when Christ is
[1:11:46] manifested in you then the
[1:11:49] responsibility comes upon you
[1:11:51] now there is a responsibility because it
[1:11:54] takes a consecrated life amen as I said
[1:11:58] the prophet had to go through tears to
[1:12:01] blood to sweat to bring this message
[1:12:04] forth now for Christ to be manifested
[1:12:06] you it's going to take the same thing
[1:12:08] it's going to take a consecrated life
[1:12:10] you can't be the same as the world yes
[1:12:12] yes God is calling us to be separate
[1:12:14] from the world it's not hard to be
[1:12:16] enticed it's very easy to be enticed by
[1:12:18] the world because sin is appetizing sin
[1:12:21] is waiting at the door but we got to he
[1:12:25] to the Holy Spirit we got to resist the
[1:12:27] devil amen we got to walk and stay under
[1:12:30] the covering of the word amen the minute
[1:12:33] we step out of the word and Satan got
[1:12:35] the right to take advantage of us but we
[1:12:38] must come back to the word hallelujah
[1:12:40] that is why a son and daughter of God
[1:12:41] can't stay and remain in a sinful
[1:12:44] condition yeah a son and daughter of God
[1:12:46] you don't have to keep telling him come
[1:12:48] back he must come back amen
[1:12:51] amen just as Eve was taken out of Adam
[1:12:54] the bride is taken from Christ
[1:12:56] sharing is nature and life we are
[1:12:59] partakers of this divine nature didn't
[1:13:01] Peter say that we are made partakers of
[1:13:04] this divine nature
[1:13:07] Amen in the Old Testament the word was
[1:13:10] veiled in the
[1:13:11] Tabernacle in Jesus day the world was
[1:13:14] veiled in human body but today the word
[1:13:17] the word is veiled in the brde yes
[1:13:20] amen 2 Corinthians 318 says but we all
[1:13:24] would open fa is beholding as in a glass
[1:13:27] the glory of the Lord are changed into
[1:13:29] the same image from Glory unto glory
[1:13:33] amen amen so as we are receiving the
[1:13:35] word which is coming through the
[1:13:37] fivefold ministry that same word that we
[1:13:39] are eating of we are changing from Glory
[1:13:42] unto Glory your journey cannot remain
[1:13:45] stagnant there has to be a progression
[1:13:47] in your walk amen that word that we
[1:13:50] receive is changing us from Glory unto
[1:13:52] Glory that one of these days oh brother
[1:13:55] oh my dear sister one of these days that
[1:13:57] wretched body of yours amen oh that
[1:14:00] wretched body that one that's causing
[1:14:02] all the problem right now the greatest
[1:14:03] enemy that we have that's going to be
[1:14:06] delivered that's going to be changed
[1:14:07] that's what the B say we the Redemption
[1:14:10] of our bodies thank you Lord amen thank
[1:14:13] you Lord and therefore you are here
[1:14:15] right now you are changing into his
[1:14:17] image and you are reflecting back is
[1:14:20] glory amen as the word is unveiling
[1:14:23] Earth amen so must reflect back his
[1:14:27] body his glory sorry you must reflect
[1:14:30] back his glory that's why when when when
[1:14:32] God when Moses met with God and the
[1:14:34] glory of God shown upon because it was
[1:14:36] God in Moses amen Moses became God to
[1:14:39] the
[1:14:40] people and therefore when the people
[1:14:42] looked at him they could see the glory
[1:14:43] of God shining through him so when the
[1:14:46] people see you they must see the glory
[1:14:47] of God shining through you the must you
[1:14:50] that you're not an ordinary
[1:14:52] person and if you are a son and daughter
[1:14:54] of God you will take a side you'll take
[1:14:55] Sid with the word of Jesus you won't
[1:14:57] take sides with the world you'll take
[1:14:59] sides with the word
[1:15:05] amen so you find that in this hour the
[1:15:07] bride is making herself ready a dawn in
[1:15:09] the righteousness of the
[1:15:11] Saints amen because why we are the word
[1:15:14] living itself
[1:15:16] out that's why we can over when you are
[1:15:19] living the word out you overcome every
[1:15:20] deception of the enemy in this last days
[1:15:22] amen yes because why you stand on the
[1:15:25] unchanging word of God you have to
[1:15:27] manifest The Life of Christ by living a
[1:15:29] Victorious holy
[1:15:33] life amen and the token has to be
[1:15:35] applied because as you receive the Holy
[1:15:38] Spirit what is the holy spirit is the
[1:15:39] literal Life of Christ should carry the
[1:15:42] token which is the literal Life of
[1:15:44] Christ amen displaying the evidence of
[1:15:47] his resurrection
[1:15:49] hallelu because what is showing for the
[1:15:52] little you have to come into a union you
[1:15:54] have you have conception now the little
[1:15:56] Life of Christ is being show forth
[1:15:59] through you amen so in this last day

[1:16:14] ordinary person don't think yourself
[1:16:17] think of yourself as just a church goer
[1:16:19] because then you will be following the
[1:16:20] traditions of man God God called us out
[1:16:24] of traditions amen he's come to break us
[1:16:26] out of traditions he's come to show you

[1:16:37] honor in his power to be vessels of
[1:16:39] Honor amen vessels that he can manifest
