Psalms 34 and verse 1 says I will bless the Lord at all times I Will Bless The Lord sometimes I Will Bless The Lord when he's blessing me I Will Bless The Lord when things are good he says I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth amen never stop it but his praise continually in our mouth amen Psalm 100 and verse 4 praise the Lord hallelujah amen Psalm 100 and verse 4 says enter into his gates with Thanksgiving come into His courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name amen one more scripture we'll go to Matthew 6 and 9. here the Lord is teaching us how to pray and you'll see if we mix our prayer with praise we can have more Dynamic results amen just gonna take the opening verse of that prayer Matthew 6 and 9. Our Father who shot in heaven and yet he starts to praise Hallowed be thy name amen you go straight into praise halloweth holy is your name amen then he's asking for the kingdom to come his will to be done on Earth as it is in heaven you may be seated the Lord bless the reading of his word even as we hear the word faith cometh by the hearing of the word amen hallelujah amen so the expression how can we express our faith amen hallelujah so a Christian we know he's somebody who is glad who has joy of the Lord the joy of the Lord is our friend amen hallelujah so somebody who's always displaying joy of the Lord both in good times and in bad times so God's Praises must continually be in our mouth if we want to have joy and walk in Victory amen a Believer is full of joy amen you you know something about a Believer nothing gets him down amen hallelujah nothing can get him down not sickness not death not circumstance amen amen we've been through many fiery trials we've been through many persecutions in his life we've lost our loved ones but if you've seen us down have you seen us depressed no no amen hallelujah we know who we are and we know who we serve amen amen we know who's in control amen hallelujah depression doesn't get us anxiety doesn't get us amen because of the faith that is within us amen so a Believer who is always full of joy has learned the secret of living life of prayer living a life of praise and worship to our God amen if you don't have joy then we haven't learned amen the valuable secret of praising God praise will shake that anxiety off of you amen praise will shake fear off of you amen amen amen amen Our Praise life is closely connected to our faith life so our praise will perfectly reflect our faith if our faith is weak then our praise is weak amen Hallelujah but we are building up our faith now build upon your Most Holy Faith yes yes amen so prison is an expression of our faith somebody say praise is an expression of my faith amen hallelujah amen so we are walking amen by faith and it's something we do every day not occasionally yes we don't skip a day free it's to be exercised there's no skipping a day like how you skip gym amen but Faith must be exercised daily and God presents circumstances God presents problems God presents situations for us daily so that we can have victory over the circumstance and God will present people to you who are an anxiety depression amen there's so much of turmoil in the world today but God will present people to you because God wants you to bring Deliverance to them God wants you to teach them because you are a disciple in this hour amen and you learn very quickly when you start to teach the word of God when you start your image you express the word of God to somebody amen hallelujah yes you no longer become a hero of the word but you become a doer of the world you become a teacher of the world Amen you become a solution to people's problems yes amen amen you become the hands of Jesus you become the feet of Jesus you become the mouth of Jesus that should be our prayer Lord let me be your eyes Let Me Be Your Hands let me be your feet let me be your ears oh God hallelujah amen hallelujah the Bible says in second Corinthians 5 7 we walk by faith and not by sight Amen in other words we always walk in light of God's word we hold on to the promises of God's word and now if you know that God was in simplicity you mean I don't have to work up my own theology no all you got to take is the word of God and apply it by the lips of Faith amen find the promises of God in the word and speak it by faith yes amen God didn't complicate it for us man has complicated religion man has complicated things amen but Hallelujah Malachi 4 came to turn our hearts back to the apostolic faith back to the word of God Amen Upon This Rock I shall build my church upon the revelation of God's word amen Amen brother that's so simple you mean I must just say back the word of God yes hallelujah amen what then amen what exuberant praise amen it's joyous and restrained praise amen enthusiastic praise something that we seem to lack Hallelujah but get your praise shoes on Amen Hallelujah pray it shouldn't just be amen with words only we can express praise through many different forms amen put up a uh Psalm 149 they let's see amen some of the ways we can express amen hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song so songs are expressing praise I know some of us don't like to sing amen but you can praise the Lord in a song amen and his praise in the congregation of saints amen that's what we do here let Israel rejoice in him that made him and let the children of Zion be joyful in their King amen some people are so sad in the presence of the Lord amen but be joyful in your king amen amen let them praise His name in the dance oh somebody dance with the Lord amen hallelujah you've never danced for the Lord there's nothing wrong with dancing for the Lord amen when you're in the world you dance for the devil yeah you shook your body for the devil but the Bible is declaring that you can Praise Him in the dance amen I'm not just talking to get you set up now you need to change our ways amen start to dance for the Lord is this the Bible Praise Him in the dance amen when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus [Music] we're going to start praising his name Hallelujah for the King of Kings and the Lord of lords amen we shall bow before him many many men amen even right now Shake Yourself amen change right now in the service amen lift your hands up and praise the Lord amen hallelujah glory be to his name Hallelujah let them sing praises unto him with a timbrel amen a tambourine in your hand amen and a heart stringed instruments for the lord taketh pleasure in who hallelujah amen the lord loves you to do this he takes pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation what comes up to praise salvation what salvation delivers from your sickness deliverance from your problem amen it's locked up in the power of praise thank you Lord thank you Jesus let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their bids amen these are the scriptures that Paul and Silas were thinking about Amen Let the Saints be joyful in glory yeah they were in the bed amen with stripes on their back amen they were beaten amen without a cause and here they were not putting ointment on one another's back amen not trying to console one another but their mind was caused back to the word of God let the Saints be joyful in glory let them cry aloud let them sing aloud upon their beds amen amen the Praises of God be in their mouth and a two-aged sword in their hand amen the word of God in our hands are we ready amen hallelujah the word of God is even in thy mouth amen hallelujah so always start to praise the word of praise the name of the Lord amen when you're traveling in your car amen wherever you're going just say thank you Jesus praise you Jesus I thank you for the victory of the cross I thank you for salvation you know what you're doing you're causing Annihilation and Devastation in the Kingdom of Satan amen you are clearing the pathway before you that wherever you go demon Spirits are free thank you Lord amen hallelujah he comes amen he fights your battle for you to execute Vengeance and judgment upon the heathens punishment upon demon powers and people that come against you but it's all locked up in praise amen you make your notion now you read 150 go quickly in 150 then you'll see amen if you don't know what to read during the week write down now Psalm 150 I must read learn how to praise the Lord amen you'll tell you how to praise the Lord here amen amen praise the Lord all glory be to his name thank you Lord amen many many men amen prayer amen you know the Lord told him if my people were called by my name and we've been called by his name not only have we been called by his name but we have received the revelation of his name and we have the married name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen if we humble ourselves and pray did we humble ourselves this year and pray amen amen and he promised you would hear from Heaven amen you will heal our bodies he will heal our land he will heal all unbelief amen all Strife or worry or fear all anxiety amen you will hear from Heaven amen amen heal us amen praise be to God Amen Hallelujah but you know pray prayer has protocol pray you've got to go through channels amen hallelujah amen prayer Daniel Prayed one time and there was protocols amen and God was sending back the word back through Angels amen and sometimes prayer amen is not maybe the thing that you need because in the midst of great trial and Circumstance you need an immediate answer amen hallelujah amen so if you go to Ephesians 6 12 amen it tell you that how these demon powers were fighting the Prince of Persia amen 21 days Michael had to come and assist Gabriel he was going back to the Earth with the word because Daniel prays had gone up to the heavens on the first day and God heard his praise and God dispatched Gabriel to go and give him back the answer but there was resistance from The Prince of Persia amen so prayer has brought a call prayers can be hindered amen through there because of your unbelief because of your unforgiveness praise can be hindered and also because of obstruction from the Demonic realm you'll see and we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places amen hallelujah so you find that if you read Daniel chapter Amen in Daniel you find that there was a delay in the response yes amen but that prayer was for revelation of the world but when you need Deliverance amen you turn on your praise you get on your pretty shoes you get on your dancing shoes amen hallelujah hallelujah there was other three boys there Amen in that Babylonian system amen Shadrach Meshach and abidny go amen and there was a threat upon their lives because they were following the word of God they were Resolute on the word of God and Exodus 20 verse 1 told them I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage thou shall have no other gods before me amen that shall not make unto thee any Graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in Earth beneath or that is in the water under the Earth thou shall not bow thies down thyself to them nor serve them yes for us I the Lord thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me amen so these children of Israel were presented with an image of Daniel and they were asked to bow down before the prophet be spiritual now they were asked to bother him before the image of the Prophet amen hallelujah but here they were resoluting their faith amen and they said no we will not bow down King amen they refused to bow down and here you'll find it in Daniel chapter 3 amen we can go to Daniel chapter 3 quickly then amen so the king makes a decree amen that every time they hear the sounds of the music everyone must bow down so they had a practice run and everyone bowed down except three people you can pick this up in Revelation chapter 13. about people who refuse to Bow onto the image of the beast in this hour people whose names are found in the book amen the Bible says that the only ones who didn't bother and worship the image of the Beast are those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world and tonight I'm happy to tell you that I'm one of them are you one of them amen who will not bow down to the image amen amen hallelujah amen verse 13. here's the Beast now in his rage you know Revelation 13 and years in in verse 13 then Nebuchadnezzar and his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and Abednego then they brought these men before the king Nebuchadnezzar says is it true Shadrach Meshach Abednego do you not serve my gods no worship the golden image which I have set up so he says now I'm going to give you another chance I'm the king I can spend your life I'm gonna let the music play again amen when you hear the sound of the corner the flute the heart set with Sultry and dulcimer and all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made but if you worship not you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace which is that the God and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands who is as uncircumcised amen Babylonian King will dare to challenge God Amen he's asking who's the god that's going to deliver you and God's about to show him amen that's right amen amen but Shadrach Meshach and Abednego had no audible word from the Lord they were going based on scripture yeah the scripture we just read now shall have no other gods before me no other grieving image you should not bow down that's how we are to stand on the word of God Amen I'm saying it again the prophet came to point us back to the word of God he's the revealer of the word of God amen amen we seem to have forgotten that for 2 000 years the word was taken out of the people amen the nicolaitan spirit that come upon the people and in this last days denominations has diluted the word amen they have taken the word out of the people yes amen but we thank God for Vindicated Prophet amen we thank God for Revelation 10 7 amen amen who has come to reveal the mysteries of the Bible amen that we know who the one true God is and like Daniel said the people who know their God shall do great exploit say Amen we are the people amen glory be to his name amen he says we are not careful to answer you we are bold to speak to you King should be so our God whom we serve he's able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver it Deliver us out of thine handle King but if not be known as the deal King that we will not serve thy gods no worship the golden image which thou has set up amen so what do they do first they begin to praise God they're saying I was God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace they are making their boasting God they are praising God yes our God is able amen so what do they do do they go on their knees and pray come on now you think they have time to wait 21 days for Michael to be here upheld in battle amen hallelujah so what is that teaching us amen oh praise be to the name of God Amen if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of that hand okay but if not be known unto deal King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou is set up so there was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury amen and he commanded that they should heat up the furnace seven times hotter and that's the type of the seven Church age you don't believe me the type of the seven Church age all Hall is let loose upon the Earth amen the Bible says the writer on the horse is called death and Hell Followed him amen the battle is hot and heavy sometimes hotter um demon powers influencing people demon powers oppressing people yes amen there is nothing but Insanity all around us yes people groping in darkness amen looking for some form of satisfaction in this life but they can find no satisfaction in his life amen you find people who have who have achieved our success in this life in terms of finances in terms of in terms of wealth in terms of in terms of maybe a home and a good job and a car amen they don't have peace here they go to alcohol they go to drugs they go to aim at smoking to addiction and all kinds of things they're going to they don't have peace because the only real peace you can find is in the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says I will keep the imperfect peace whose mind is stayed on me you don't need to go to a psychologist if you have a troubled mind the Bible is the answer amen the word of God is the answer God said I will keep you in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me so the person is going through anxiety through depression to problems in his life needs to get into the word of God needs to get all of the promises of God amen I need to start to believe those promises of God and need to confess it amen if you confess with your mouth and believe in your heart amen glory be to his name so he commanded amen now he commanded the most mighty men that were in the Army to bind Shadrach Meshach and Abednego so he didn't get some sissies amen then they bound these men in their quotes they're awesome they act and other garments and they were cast in the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king's commandment was urgent if the natural King's commandment was urgent how much more the King of Kings amen hallelujah and the fun is exceeding out the flames of fire slew those strong men yeah that took up Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and when they were bound and cast into the furnace they began lifting up their voices in amen so what happens here Nebuchadnezzar the king is astonished Rises up in haste and he speaks to the counselors do not be cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered oh true king he says lo I see four men loose amen amen I see four men loose amen they were not bound anymore somebody lost them somebody loose them in the midst of the prison Amen in the midst of the fire and he says they have no hurts and the form of the foot is like the Son of God now if you believe it's the same yesterday today and forever if they still throw you in a fiery furnace today the fire will not consume you amen some of you are looking at me confused some of you have not seen the power of God amen some of you are feeling cold here amen I'm talking about fire and you're feeling cold amen hallelujah you need some Holy Ghost Fire amen get your hands out of your pocket some of you go sit in your way casually very casually I want you to kick your hands out of your pockets and start Clapping Your Hands and praising the Lord amen praise the Lord I said praise the Lord amen some of you have to drag our priests from your mouth I'm coming now I'm passing the mic amen I want you to be a church on fire I want you to be a Church on the Move amen Hallelujah yes amen you know some tortoises don't move unless you like your life am I right many many men please be to our God Amen Hallelujah what are we doing right now we are slaying demon powers we are slaying the enemy amen we are coming against principalities and Powers even tonight you may not

Satan on any ground any time under any circumstance amen bring the best that you got amen we are ready for you yes no thank you amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah you know what the king now declares amen then Nebuchadnezzar came near the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and speak to Shadrach Meshach and Abednego now you start to praise the Lord your Servants of the most high God come forth come either their feet turned the king's words into praise amen hallelujah he couldn't go into the furnace to get them you have to call him to come out he couldn't send anybody there to get them out amen you put me in the fire I'll be the one who comes out of the fire on my own will and my own accord you put me on the bed of Affliction and coming out of my own amen I'm not coming out on your terms Satan I'm coming out on my terms amen because the deliverable is with me in the fire did you hear what I said you are coming out of your sicknesses on God's term they're not on Satan's terms thank you thank you Lord you put me in this bed of reflection Affliction but I'm coming out of God's terms which is healed heal which is delivered which is set free amen thank you Lord thank you and the princes and the governors Kings counselors amen gathered and saw these men upon whose bodies no fire had power fire had no power over them you believe you are that like that fires no power over you sickness has no power over you amen not an air of the head was sinned signed neither were the quotes changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them amen hallelujah now the King goes on to praise the Lord blessed be the God hallelujah amen you shall turn amen you know even Satan must bow down at the name of Jesus Amen even Satan will confess that he is Lord yes the king of Babylon now sought to praise God blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego who had sent who who's the Sparkman in the furnace who is speaking about oh come on now suddenly the king gets revelation of who this man and the man in the fiery furnaces hello are you reading your Bible what sent his Angel and the Liberty servants that trusted in him and have changed the king's word hahaha your praise has power to change authorities words around you King's words your boss's worth amen hallelujah are you learning amen the power is in your mouth Yes lose it yes change the king's word healed their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any God except their own God who is this that comes down in the fiery furnace the angel of the Lord amen go to 29 there I make a decree that every people Nation tribe and town sounds familiar could speak anything you missed the god of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made at Daniel because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort and after they put you in a fiery child this is what they do in verse 13. a force to promote you amen amen amen the king promotes Shadrach Meshach and Abednego in the who caused their promotion who needled him they would have carried on in the ordinary positions but because they chose to put them in a fiery furnace they now must promote them pay them more amen amen amen who is this one amen Hallelujah isn't it the same Angel of the Lord that came in the burning bush the bush did not burn yeah amen Moses trying to decide to see the bush but the bush didn't burn yes yes amen you'll see that in Exodus 20. amen the bush didn't burn because the angel of the Lord was in the bush so the angel of the Lord came in the fire and he took away the heat of the fire amen praise be to God Amen Hallelujah so amen we told you read Psalm 150 149 you come across all of these things amen yeah we find now Hallelujah if we go to Kings amen chapter 20. to find here they have three kings and the armies coming after Joseph Anthony's people amen we got First Kings chapter 20. amen he came to pass after this also it may be second Kings just check the equator it came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of Ammon and with them beside the ammonites came again show us referred to battle so who is this three kings and the armies have formed one Army some of you got it three kings and their armies are formed into one powerful Army amen what is this the three horse riders merge together and become the Payless Rider the pay loss is a mixture of all three horse riders yes amen glory be to his name amen and here in verse so we find here that even though there's a merger of these three powers and the Payless right is going forth greater Is In Me Greater is he that is in me amen then the force Riders yes amen fear the Bible says and he set himself to seek the Lord he proclaimed of us through all of Judah watch now he uses prayer but prayer is going to give him the answer to the victory so he proclaimed the first throughout all Judah and Judah gathered together themselves amen you shouldn't find it it's the book of Kings chapter 20. amen Joseph had feared and sent himself to seek the Lord and Proclaim they fast toward all Judah and Judah gathered themselves together or maybe sorry II Chronicles 20. second chronicles amen that's why you're not finding second chronicles 20. and Joseph had feared and set himself to seek the Lord and proclaim the first word all Judah and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord even out of the cities of Judah so now they ask the Lord oh Lord God of our fathers other not God in heaven and rulers thou over the kingdoms of the Eden and in thine hand is not their power and might so that none is able to withstand thee other not our God you see how we need to pray are you not the god of William Branham who described the inhabitants out of this land before the people of Israel and gave it it to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever you're reminding God remind God of his promises amen foreign judgment pestil into famine we shall stand yeah he's quoting scripture now we stand before the south in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our Affliction and thou will hear us and help us so you see how we can quote back the scripture to God that's why I say don't pray on prayers Jehoshaphat is taking a scripture amen and he's asking God back the scripture amen okay we got it our scriptures are back so verse 13 is very important because everybody must get involved are we paying attention everyone in the household must get involved what does the Bible say yeah and all Judah stood before the Lord with it little ones there wives and their children the whole family must be involved everyone must be involved amen hallelujah glory be to his name then the son of Zechariah the son of beninaya the son of jail the son of matanaya and the son of asaph came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation who is the spirit of the Lord comes and anoints these men and he said I can be all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord unto you amen amen there's a special class of people who has not saved the Lord it's only those who have the spirit of the Lord if the spirit is in you and you're speaking thus saith the Lord Be not Afraid or dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God's amen amen tomorrow going out against them behold they come now watch navigation that time they didn't have navigation right they didn't know where they were but the angel of the Lord the spirit of God is revealing their location he's saying tomorrow God against them behold they come up by the Cliff of Zeus they are hiding by the cliff and you find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of jerua amen amen amen the Lord knows where your enemies are lurking you need to speak to him you shall not need to fight in this battle I mean if you want to fight a war like this amen amen hallelujah but you see now God doesn't exclude them from the battlefield they must go on to the battlefield but he tells them you shall not need to fight this battle set yourselves stand he still amen amen and see the salvation of the Lord is with you amen o Judah Jerusalem fear not no be just me you cannot operate in a system of fear amen when your fearful faith is defeated yes faith is powerless amen conquer fear tomorrow God against him for the Lord will be with you and Joseph had bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord amen and the Levi is the children of kohinootides and the children of core Heights stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high amen now I want you to know there's something about praising the Lord with a loud voice hello amen Apostle please go past the scripture you've got to praise the Lord with a loud voice [Music] amen hallelujah amen some of us are too quiet for the Lord yeah amen some of us would have been running behind the Donkey [Music] raising that the family fight too [Music] get excited for God Amen Make a Joyful Noise to the Lord don't care who he is you amen hallelujah some of you amen the reason why your son your daughter can't praise the Lord they've never heard you praise the Lord they've never heard you say thank you Jesus amen because God has not done something for you to get excited about Amen to praise the Lord about him Hallelujah amen all glory be to his name amen hallelujah we need Amen to shake the devil off amen we need to lose all Pride amen we need to lose our shame amen I don't care if the children think I'm mad I'm gonna praise my God Amen I'm going to worship my God Amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen you have to begin now they didn't wait for the next day of battle as soon as they are the word of God these people got to praise and they got a guitar amen they got a campfire going amen then you're preparing the song what songs are we gonna sing they had a band rehearsal amen they stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high and there they rose up early in the morning and went forth in the wilderness right now Joseph had the king comes and he says believe in the Lord your God so shall he be established believe His prophets so shall he Prosper amen and when you're consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord amen Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory he didn't call the prayer warriors yeah come on now amen he didn't want his prayers to be hindered by demonic forces the Bible says that he inhabits the Praises of his people so they were going to turn on praise because they needed God to show up amen amen same like those three boys they didn't go on their knees and pray amen Daniel Prayed and you went to 21 days the three Hebrew boys turned on their praise and got the king of glory to come down amen amen amen many many men so he says amen he appointed singers not the not the prayer warriors amen he didn't recall the prayer warriors he appointed singers unto the Lord now prayer has a purpose prayer has its place I'm teaching you in the time of emergency you need to turn on your praise let your prayer be accompanied with praise that's right we just showed you how Joseph had prayed before the Lord but prayer released the key to the victory the Lord told him your key is not through prayer only amen the key is to praise

my praise amen hallelujah you don't lose your praise and they went out before the army unusual way to fight a battle you know what they put out in the front the footmen because they are dispensable they put the the new recruits out in the front they're dispensable because they're easy targets they put the stronger men in the back Hallelujah but yeah they put the praise they put their praise and worship singers that's why the praise and worship service goes before the preaching amen is to change the atmosphere amen bring the presence of God down yes amen hallelujah some of you wondering why are they telling me to sing you sing and you praise the name of Jesus you sing whether you like to or not you sing whether you feel like or not you've seen whether you're sick or not you glorify his name whether you want to or not amen they went out before the Army praised the Lord for his mercy and Jordan forever and they began to sing and praise and the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon Moab and Monsieur which came against Judah amen Hallelujah so they had three people here and God caused praise cause confusion in the enemy's camp he killed him well sorry those two got

they're wondering what's Happening Here now they're attacking one another you're stupid I told you to possess him better amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen so yeah they start to attack one another amen and you'll find you can read the rest of the story but you pick up here in verse 25 this is good I want to read this when Joseph had came this is one time the Lord allowed them to do this and these people came to take away the spoils of them they found amongst them an abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away sure and they were three days in gathering of her spoil it was so much amen amen many many men Hallelujah you know why when Satan brings sickness on you and God heals you you can give

trumpets unto the house of the Lord and the fear of the Lord is upon the countries amen hallelujah one more example we're going to take now amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen so you see what praise can do amen praise can turn amen the situation around praise can turn it amen sorrow into Joy yes amen glory be to his name hallelujah praise the Lord so here was amen talking about Paul and silence now if we go to Philippians 4 and 4 yeah the Apostle Paul is writing and he says rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice this was a man who rejoiced when he was in prison amen I think it's Acts chapter 16. they were in prison and the Bible says you know they threw them into jail they whooped them and they threw them into jail but the Bible says when the Trump turned midnight Paul and Silas began to praise the Lord amen these men were in prison they were beaten they had nothing to sing about they had nothing to reach but like we read in Psalm 149 let them sing aloud on their beds they start to praise the Lord even though they were in prison facing death going through terrible torture in the prison yet they were filled with so much of praise and thanksgiving amen and like we were saying this is a secret to our victories amen amen secret to experience the victories of God in our life secret Amen to experience the joy and the strength of God this is the key to Rejoice the key to Rejoice Amen in knowing the knowledge of who God is in this hour amen knowing who is out delivering this hour amen that Jesus is with you that Jesus is not only with you but he dwells within you he said Lord I Am With You Always I've given you my Holy Spirit amen praise the Lord so we know that Joy comes with knowledge Joy comes as a result of the word of God knowing the end result before it is manifested produces Joy amen when your mind is fixed on God's promises it gives you Joy but Paul is saying don't look at your circumstances but look at what God is and he is with you and he is in you and therefore you can rejoice amen now you are able to unleash the greatest power in the universe amen by rejoicing and praising God but the devil occupies your time and he comes to trouble your mind with trials tribulations and your problems so when your mind is full of of Trials your mind is full of anxiety your mind is still of worry Satan can destroy your praise the enemy comes to kill stealer destroyed so he comes to fill your mind with anxiety comes to fill your mind with worry come to fill your mind with depression comes to feel it with all kinds of troubles amen trouble on all fronts remember these fronts are battlefields on the work front on the home front amen hallelujah sometimes on the church front these are battlefields amen amen hallelujah glory be to his name amen coming to destroy your praise but a person who is rejoicing he knows who he is in Christ the power that is backing him up is knowing amen that the victory was obtained on the cross of Calvary thank you oh brother why are you going back to the cross the cross is important the cross is our foundation the cross is our Victory amen we know that we have the victory through the cross that we were forgiven on the cross amen our sin nature was nailed to the cross now we can live in righteousness now we can live in Perfection now we can live cleanse now we can live amen in all the benefits that Jesus died for us the moment we think amen that we can have our own righteousness the Bible says our righteousness is a truth he ranks if you are so righteous and so good about so good God would have put you on the cross but we couldn't do it so God sent his only begotten son amen that whosoever should believeth on it believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen amen amen so now we have a new life we have Victory because we are forgiven in him amen amen we have new life through the sacrifice of the Cross and the blood of Jesus Christ now even though there's no physical evidence through your problem to your situation even you can see no physical evidence of the victory your faith tells you through the word of God that you have the victory that's what real faith is you look to the Unseen yes amen so when our mind are we doing this our mind is so full of the scriptures our mind is so full on the word amen we are at peace because our mind is stayed on God Amen we're not focusing on the circumstance not focusing on the trial not speaking the trial you know what most people do they speak the circumstance they speak the trial they speak the situation they tell everyone they form their own contactless they send it on the WhatsApp group Paul and Silas won't want uh phoning the the rest of the disciples hey you're not praying hard enough here we just got

nothing's happening here you need to turn on your praise turn on the praise turn on the worship praise the name of God even though you can't see the victory thank you Lord for healing me your promise is based on the word the scripture says 1 Peter 2 24 by his wounds I am healed as I 53 he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace was upon him and by his stripes I am healed confess the word of God I thank you Lord amen this is what the doctor is saying this Ethan fellow here he's coming to name me he's thinking he's having a Christian party

to the Lord people want Deliverance people want healing without coming to the Lord if you come to the Lord and surrender your life he will deliver you the Lord will set you free the Lord will heal you amen hallelujah the Bible says whosoever will let him come so we find the apollon Silas amen what is he telling us to have rejoice in the lord always again I say rejoice amen hallelujah so what are we saying true rejoicing true Joy can only come by the word of God spend time with the word of God I challenge you now you young men you young girls here replace your time you're playing games and

what's wrong with you because if it's something wrong we can pray for you right now maybe they need Deliverance right they need Deliverance it can't be that week after week we're asking you to praise the Lord and you're looking at us like there's a problem with you here you know the Lord is hearing problems amen so be so full of the word of God Paul is saying don't look to your circumstance look at what God is rejoice in the Lord amen so you are able to unleash the greatest power in the universe through praise amen but the devil will keep you focused on the problem amen when you know who you are in Christ like we said keep your mind stayed on the word of God keep your mind State on the scriptures of God Amen because tomorrow you don't know what bad reports you face tomorrow you don't know what bad news you'll face but amen you already know that this is the good news amen I don't have to read the bad news I can read the good news amen amen hallelujah in the midst of Chaos in the midst of the storm amen we realize that the Lord is with me yes amen we are able to experience the Lord presence in our lives so he says do not be fearful yeah in six and seven do not be fearful but in everything but prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving so he's mixing his prayer with praise amen but in everything now sometimes there's not everything he's not saying for everything give thanks because if you got cancer you can't give God thanks for cancer but he says in everything give thanks amen because God doesn't give you cancer Satan gave you cancer all right amen so in the midst of cancer in the midst of sickness in the midst of disease you can start to praise the Lord and give him Thanksgiving in everything because my God is greater than the sickness my God is greater than the circumstance my God is greater than my finances when you start to praising God you are actually turning your battle into the hand of God and you're saying Lord the battle is not mine I'm standing still and I'm waiting to see the salvation of the Lord I'm turning my problem to you Lord I'm treating my sorrow I'm trading my sickness and training my poverty I'm trading my circumstance I'm training my heart trouble I'm trading my sugar diabetes amen for the joy of the Lord somebody praise the Lord amen trade your trouble right now amen amen start to trade it in amen you know about trainings amen hallelujah trading amen all for the new yes yes amen we are now living the second part of the scripture where Jesus stopped email could we desire 60 amen where you spoke amen he stopped in the middle of the scripture he says I've come to give you the oil amen instead of mourning amen beautiful ashes this is the hour this is the season amen and one of these days he's gonna trade this Mortal body for an immortal body it's not long from now amen it's any day now we are moving from Mark 11 23 to John 23 your brothers your sisters shall live again amen come on now amen we are moving from speaking to the mountain all the way to the resurrection of the dead from Mark 11 23 all the way to John 11 23 amen we are in the midst of that right now we are in the midst of the progression of that and I'm telling you sons and daughters are rising now amen this is the hour when all creation is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God and by God's grace sons and daughters are rising up amen hallelujah we are not a defeated Army we are an invincible Army nothing shall be able to stand before all the Days of Our Lives you believe that amen hallelujah no situation can come before you Satan come to make you fearful but in every situation be prayerful and in all thank the Lord with supplication and Thanksgiving amen yes Hallelujah amen glory be to the Lord amen so don't focus on the circumstance focus on the word focus on the word speak the word amen God has given us freedom three son Jesus Christ amen it's a finished walk on the cross finish from sickness finish financial crisis finish amen he said it is finished so my confidence is in God and I trust him amen some of you need to say that you need to speak these words my confidence is in you Lord and I trust you that's right amen amen hallelujah I believe in much more than what my eyes are telling me yes I believe in much more than what I am hearing amen I believe in more than these five senses that's what faith is Faith denies the five senses yes yes so there's so much power in us that we can defeat Satan at his own game and turn it into a victory but the power needs to be unlocked and you know what God can't unlock it who unlocks praise you've got to unlock it God can't unlock it the only person who can unlock the power of speaking to the mountain is you know God installed it in us the power that switched the day we were born again but the only one that can turn on the switch and the power to defeat the enemy and unlock the victory is inside of us but we need to turn on the power amen amen hallelujah the victory is here for us to get amen I get answered prayers by turning on the praise I get answered prayers by turning on my prayers amen and you don't do it after you get the blessing you do it before you even see it before there's a sight of it before there's a sound of it yes I see the cloud the size of a man's hand but he declared it's gonna rain before you see one drop of rain you are speaking it amen that's what faith is all about the word of God is teaching us that we must give God praise on purpose have you ever heard people say that that person is purposefully picking on me how many of your children's dad he's doing it on purpose he's doing it on purpose you praise God on purpose amen amen praise God on purpose amen hallelujah so the person who understands that this power is laying within him purposefully give God's praise he's got a purpose for doing it and he's not doing it because he's trying to get something he's doing it out of relationship with God he's doing it because he Praises his God in every situation amen amen he's praising God in spite of the circumstance he may not feel like it but he continues to praise the Lord amen hallelujah strongholds are broken Victory is one if you understand the power of praise amen that you are unleashing by activating this power amen and when it's released from your mouth amen it goes into the spiritual realm and wherever demons have been trying to attack you those demons are attacked by the power of faith Faith coming out of your mouth Faith coming with understanding amen the Israelites knew about praise and pray in the temple only but God was showing them about praise and praying in the battle Yeah amen hallelujah because in the battlefield the praise is greater in the battlefield the prayer is greater more intense amen hallelujah so tonight if you're going through some fear some depression having suicidal thoughts fears anxiety financial crisis whatever you're going through God is much greater than the problem amen amen you've got to open up your mouth and give him praise because the word says don't be anxious about anything but in everything we pray and petition let your supplications be known to God with Thanksgiving I'm praising God because of my fellowship with him I'm praising God because of my relationship with him I'm praising God because I want to be connected with him amen I want to stay connected with him yes amen not after God moves on my behalf but before he can move I'm praising God amen amen amen I want to be in his presence I want to be connected to God I want to do what the Bible says amen you know what the Bible says the mountains melt like Wax at the presence of the law so stay in his presence the mountains will start to melt the mountains melt at the presence of the Lord so prayer is like a big gun of faith pray is like an ak-47. praise like an assault rifle automatic amen it unleashes wrath and fury sorry I'm talking about praise praise is like a big gun that unleashes wrath and fury upon Satan's kingdom Devastation man amen and you know what Atomic Warfare is right we told you that it's not saved the Lord the prophet says that saved the Lord Atomic Warfare unleashes amen so when you take the gun out the devil has to flee amen amen and don't stop firing you have unlimited supply of ammunition don't stop firing you say what's my ammunition my musician is my breath the Bible says let everything that had bread praise the Lord amen praise the Lord if you see somebody not praising now in the next few minutes I want you to go to them and say your oxygen Thief you're supposed to be praising the Lord with that breath amen turn on the praise amen tomorrow I want you to shock the family when you wake up in the morning if you're unemployed say think tell him you know what Dad Mom I thank the Lord that I'm employed amen the devil will start investigating this fella got to drop you why he's talking like this person saying they healed didn't I tell you to oppress them didn't you send reinforcements amen so take the gun out the gun of praise the god of Faith filled with faith don't stop firing on the enemy until that mountain is moved amen all these years he's been threatening you amen he's trying to be threatening you to free to the hills and the mountains amen but you are going to go and like Jesus curse the root of the problem you are going to the root of the problem amen amen hallelujah so you must trouble your trouble with the kind of faith you become troubled with the trouble because who's behind the trouble the enemy the devil wants you to keep you from praise and thanksgiving but whilst we are in the process of believing the devil knows how important it is for you to maintain your positive confession of faith so what he's doing trying to destabilize you the promises of God that you're believing in the word Satan is going to try and come and put as much pressure on you thinking that and put fear on you because you want you to disbelieve that word that's how he works through doubt and reasoning fear amen so don't stop firing the key is praise the key is prayer start to use these expressions of our faith amen and it will unlock every prison door every bondage amen when we understand the power of the expressions of our faith amen glory be to his name let's give the Lord a good example praise wonderful is the Lord let's Stand Together praise be to the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah glory be to his name yes hallelujah amen I tell you I'm about to light a fire under you now because this is not just theology hey man come on now yeah you need to turn up the praise now amen you need to turn up the worship hallelujah amen amen amen amen we haven't been hearing all of these things just particular years and hear a good sermon we need to put it in the practice immediately because if I let you go from these doors you become a hero of the word only I want you to become a doer of the word right here right now yes amen many many men Hallelujah glory be to his name amen hallelujah raise your hand and say praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah Hallelujah
