TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh amen glory be to his name amen and he's worthy of all praise amen let's turn to our Bible amen [Music] if you want [Music] let's start off reading in Philippians chapter 3 . in verse 14. we can start from verse 13 amen he says Brethren I count not myself to have be apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind amen isn't that a good thing to do we can't do a thing about the past he says forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before amen how many of us are living life like that not looking backwards amen but Reaching Forward to find many that walk with us on this journey of faith are looking backwards and still trying to figure out stuff from the past but he said reach forward amen answer the things which are before that's why the property is preaching things that are to be amen he said I press toward the mark for the prize of the eye calling of God in Christ Jesus amen while the world is being mocked by rejecting the Holy Ghost we also take on the mark of Christ it says I press toward the mark for the price of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen what a high calling we have what a privilege and a blessed people we are amen and I'm so grateful to be associated with you amen who have been called the highest calling upon the face of the Earth amen amen you are Overcomers in this last days amen hallelujah and let's read Revelation chapter 22 amen the last chapter in the Bible amen could read from verse 11 the Bible says we get the remember he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that he is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still amen everyone's going to remain in the condition amen hallelujah you may be seated bless the name of Jesus amen amen some of you have already picked it up in the spirit that the separation has already started and those that are faithless Who Remain faithless and those who have faith will move into another sphere another dimension another gear amen hallelujah because this is the time and this is the season this is the time for the opening of everything that was prophesied regarding the Bride of Jesus Christ amen amen so glory be to his name that we are part of that aren't you grateful that you are part of that amen amen doesn't it fill your heart with joy tonight to know that you have overcoming faith game amen thank you so this rocket launching of all the barriers of unbelief amen it's time to rocket launch our faith past all the barriers of unbelief amen amen we haven't received a word in this hour and in this day to remain amongst denominational chickens amen amen amen mean that we receive the word just to to cruise along yes but the word was sent to give us rapturing faith and what is rapturing Faith it's afraid to change these bodies so how can we use this word to get along in a natural life the world is not designed to accommodate the Natural Life amen the word is not designed to accommodate the natural man because the natural man will war against the word of God war against the things of God the natural man doesn't want to get into the program of God but inside of the natural man is a soul amen into the gene of God in that soul and the spirit man of God Amen be a Revival looking at a rocket launching our faith we cannot remain in the ordinary anymore right amen not if you're tired of the ordinary amen how many of you are tired of just all going to church and going back home amen how if you want to move into another gear where you know you're walking with God Amen you're communing with God Amen you are seeing a supernatural manifest in your life yeah amen now's not the time to hang around chicken amen hallelujah we can't have chicken feet and take a eagle Journey amen amen we need to leave all unbelief behind amen amen and there are levels who are free we are talking about rocket launching our faith but there are levels to our feet amen I don't wanna well I'm out not equal that's the same same anointing I think you believe that amen because when we preach it we preach like all of us will be able to do exactly the same thing that we are all carbon copies of one let's turn to current ly how the spirit was able to appreciate one another's giftings and in the body we are quickly framed and we cannot do without one another let's read this quickly enough now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you ignorant this is First Corinthians chapter 12. amen amen okay let's go to verse 4. now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit amen amen watch now there are differences of administrations right but the same Lord they are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for to one is given the spirit the word of wisdom you see why I'm saying not all of us are equally gifted amen to one is given the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit amen to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gift of healing by the same spirit amen Amen to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gift of healing by The Same Spirit right hello what you alone I've been empowered with that Faith amen don't take your faith and speak to another brother who's going to tell you no brother that day is passed God revealed it to you amen God called you for it you've got to fulfill it because you have to wait for it no I want miracles [Music] to another the interpretation of tongues but all these workers that one and the self-cent spirit dividing to every man severally as he will amen yes amen so don't be discouraged when others don't see your vision don't be discouraged when others do not want to connect with you in their grammar they are not called to connect with you in that Rhythm they are called with another gifting another anointing let them operate under their gift under their faith and you operate under your gifting a lady your faith right right amen hallelujah amen everybody feeling good amen if you read from verse 12 onwards it tells you that we are one body and many members right we don't have time to break that down now amen let's go to our next slide now when we have faith the prophet says that Faith does not notice our age who's the youngest amongst us here probably also who's the oldest amongst us amen but free don't notice your age Frank can work in a nine-year-old as good as it is in our 21 year old brother amen free don't notice your age and the sister said and the sister said we got a Brother's meeting going on here and the sister said amen because sisters don't want anyone to know to say age so sisters love Faith because Faith don't notice your age faith is not a respecter of age they don't know the circumstances the prophet says amen circumstances we spoke about that last week the symptoms that we experience in life's journey amen whatever challenges we are facing he says faith knows no age limit or circumstance Faith knows one thing God said so and that settles it amen amen Faith rest upon the solid word of God amen amen hallelujah we're entering a season now where it's time for the adoption and placing amen all right yes we've been treated we've been trained yes right the Holy Ghost have led us through the word amen and while we were going through the word now remember there are seasons of your faith when you are teaching somebody something it does not mean that they understand it immediately learning all of this time but suddenly something clicks and they understand it amen it all comes together amen when the bride recognizes who she is yes hallelujah amen and what she is called for yes she will do the Greater Works yes yes this is the season now is the season amen amen so it's a time where Christ is coming now looking for Sons and Daughters of God you say looking for sons and daughters I thought we are the wife yes every wife must produce his own life you must produce the life of the Lord Jesus Christ you must bring forth the son it says here the prophet we realize that the own law that the son was born in a home and he was a son but he too to raise him and then when he was of age if he had been the right kind of son he was taken out put a Purple Rope on in his ceremony and adopted right we all know that and he says that's what now he's praying Prophet is praying and he's talking to God and he says that's what you're trying to do to this Full Gospel now we are the only people that really believe the Full Gospel amen that's why I put it in Brackets message people that's what you're trying to do to message people now to get them out to themselves somewhere along with you in faith to adopt them into the kingdom and to give them the right to go forth and to do the things that you did amen I think we need to remind ourselves of the things that Jesus did amen oh Hallelujah amen because God wants to get us alone with him God wants to adopt us into the kingdom and to give us the right to go forth amen the son as long as he was not adopted he did not have the right to use the father's name he did not have the authority to use the father's name but once he is adopted amen his name on the check he's signing the church he's as good as the father signing it amen are you ready for that adoption amen are you ready for that season of Faith amen we're all the working of our faith amen the word amen but there's got to be a manifestation rate and for reaping amen yes and right now we're preaching but it's a special class of people that's going to connect with it in this hour amen some are looking out they're gonna make the next buck amen some are looking amen where they gonna find the next chicken or the next lamb amen the next meal amen but we are looking to the Unseen we are pressing forward amen amen Hallelujah amen amen he says God is known by simple Faith by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I think that's where we need to stop because we really need to get desperate with God and make sure that we have been baptized with the Holy Ghost amen we cannot go another second another step forward until we are certain that we have got the baptism of the Holy Ghost there are millions on the earth proclaiming to be Christians walking and saying that they're walking a Christian walk but they do not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost we do not want to be found in that same boat amen he says God in you thank you Lord we know the scripture that's it Emmanuel we called Emmanuel that means god Emmanuel but he wants to be in you and he says God in you truly brings you of God changes your name you know your nature represents your name the name represents your nature amen so when he changes your nature it's going to give you a new name God the Creator made all things and spoke the word into existence by his word that same Spirit In You now these are the kind of things we ought to meditate upon God the one that in the beginnings and let there be that same Spirit dwells in you and I am everything God says and there's nothing impossible amen amen amen Hallelujah the prophet was talking to a doctor one time and he the doctor said you know what I tried studying what you believe I studied it for four years and I come to the conclusion there's nothing to it the prophet says it depends on what you believe he says you've got the best x-ray machines amen you look through the human body and so forth and that's wonderful he said you're looking because you're taking of the tree of knowledge he says that tree was from the Garden of Eden the doctor couldn't make sense of what he was reading but he has the prophet breaking down and saying you by your science are eating from the tree that was in the Garden of Eden right he says but that was in the Garden of Eden and man's been eaten from the tree since Eden and it's got a limitation amen so the tree of knowledge has a limitation amen yes yes oh we can have the best education we can have the best jobs but that limited we are not satisfied with that amen I guarantee you if I paid you a million grand every month you'll never be happy you'll be the most miserable person on the face of the Earth right right some of you thinking that's impossible now amen he says it's got its limitation but the tree of faith of God is unlimited amen amen amen he says you believe scientists fire science can go and then when you can scant scientifically search it out anymore then step off and start believing from there on what is he saying you need to rocket launch yourself you need to step out into the unknown amen he said that's the way you will have to do it and if you want to take a step tonight amen amen amen amen amen let's leave all carnality amen let's leave all human reasoning amen let's step forward into what God is saying amen son he goes on to say that some are afraid to ask God something that they are bothering God would they request he says you can never exhaust God's love and mercy to you oh aren't you thankful for that because I need his love and I need his Mercy every day of my life how about you amen amen amen I need his love and his Mercy every day he says well I hate to bother you so much father amen not here's what he says he wants to be bothered that way even though he didn't want to entertain that sort of Phoenician woman he loved it when she begged him he loved it when the persistent Widow came yes he says he wants to be bothered that way he does don't never think that you could ever ask too much of God Amen amen I want you to stop now whatever you're believing God for if you had 100 belief I want you to add another zero and if you have enough Faith add another zero take it up another thousand million I'm not talking rents now but if you want that's what you're praying for then I pray you'll receive it amen I'm talking about the level of your faith take it from 10 to 100 take it from 100 to a thousand percent amen thank you he says don't never think that you could ever ask God to ever ask too much of God I believe the scripture said you have not because you ask not yes and you ask not because you believe not and then you know the Bible goes on to say and even when you ask you ask a miss amen how many if you know what Oscar Miss means you ask without faith here the prophet goes on to say now he wants you us to ask and believe that our joy would be full right he wants you to ask abundantly ask for big things yes don't limit your faith to some little mustard seed or some love the scripture where Jesus Jesus is just trying to get your faith started there but we are not at the start anymore amen we are in the astronaut age amen we need to rocket launch yes amen he says don't limit your faith to some little mustard tree Seed Faith some go to the Lord Lord you know I have just got the faith enough the grain of a mustards no deal your favor amen how do you say how do I build my faith faith cometh by the hearing how much of time are you spending with the word yeah amen we've been speaking on the angel of the Lord we've been speaking about communing with angels where we will see in general visitation amen we can't do that with unbelief in our life right because while angels are yet to influence and guide us they are other Angels here as well called fallen angels known as demons they are also here to influence us how do they influence us through television through movies through media to things we are reading so there's a great war going on we're always talking about the white dog and the black dog look in your own life for the white dog and the black dog look every day in your life look at the phone because that's you know is what possesses you these days before I'm saying you don't own a phone the phone owns you that's right amen so now there's a fight going on you got the Bible left and you got tick tock now the Bible asked you know you got your phone set in a way that it puts absolutely not used to sleep and if you go to that setting you see the Bible app has gone to sleep because it hasn't been opened and then you go to the other section setting and it says most battery usage app that's using the most battery and then you'll see Tick Tock WhatsApp Facebook build your hopes on things eternal it can happen to any of us amen it could happen to all of us I'm saying if we examine Our Lives how is it with us is the Lord sharing now I wasn't aware that there was load sharing amen Hallelujah [Music] so the program of God is telling us hey man we need to ask God for big things some of the younger people I think that the Holy Ghost is big people things it's for the big people the Holy Ghost is for all of us amen if you desire the baptism of the Holy Ghost right now the Lord can give it to you amen because while Peter yet speak the Holy Ghost fell you see you need to be sitting there and you don't need to be all Reverend you can be talking to the Lord you can be saying amen amen you can be saying in your mind even saying it in a wish for Lord give me the Holy Ghost Lord answer my name Lord while the preachers preaching speak to me amen we need to shake things up in the church we need people's feet to rise up in the church amen don't limit to your Mustard Seed friend amen the prophet says when the what the church is slacking today is testifying of our great powerful Jesus today amen let's go to the next slide here brother Jane move it along it says what the church is slacking today is testifying of our great powerful Jesus today I think if you see it you might be able to understand it amen he's saying people are not testifying of the power of Jesus even if God is doing something for us we are not testifying about it he says what the church is lacking amen and testifying of our great powerful Jesus today he says we try to limit him oh just say he was back Yonder and the church who's got a vision knows this and knows it ought not to be slack at any time but telling everywhere that Jesus lives and Reigns amen for those of you that were distracted when was the last time you testified of what Jesus did for you when was the last time you testified what the Lord is doing amen when was the last time you testified um they said God posted
