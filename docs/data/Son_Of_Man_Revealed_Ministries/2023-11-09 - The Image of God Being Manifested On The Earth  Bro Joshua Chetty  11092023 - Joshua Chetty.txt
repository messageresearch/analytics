the wonderful the most holy name amen of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah let's give the Lord a good hand clap of Praise I was about to announce a Caleb is not here and I see he miraculously appeared here he's traveling like Phillip amen hallelujah good to see you brother Caleb amen they were away in ptor amen visiting sister baby there and they had message that she wasn't doing too well how is she doing now amen so we prayed you know we prayed on Wednesday and brother Caleb's message to me was the family was surprised when they arrived there how well sister baby is amen hallah am is the Angel of the Lord going before yes Hallelujah so they were going like calling the family for a final visit but the Lord can turn things around and with the K didn't mention to me amen remember we are like Abraham we call those things that are not as though they are so he didn't mention to me he says when I get there I want the things to be different and as he said it you remember you telling me that as he said it so it has been amen because we carry the anointing with us we carry the holy spirit with us amen hallelujah so he can work things out for our good amen we just got to have faith to believe it let's put up Mark 9:23 we know that's our scripture amen for this month that we are focusing on amen hallelujah how many of you know it's the n9th month amen and it's the year 2023 amen hallelujah so 9:23 says if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believe amen if thou can't believe all things are possible to the pastor all things are possible to the evangelist keep coming to the good old priest all things are possible to him that believeth amen that's the power of the Holy Ghost he's put the life back into the church aren't you glad to be a part of it amen just want to read one quote amen hallelujah amen while you're getting the quote up amen want to welcome amen my father and my mother amen Nicholson let's welcome them in the house of the Lord amen good you have your back amen praise the Lord amen Hallelujah they couldn't make it they were trying to make it for the birthday but they had some engine trouble now I'm going to encourage you with a with a very powerful testimony amen I'd like to call Brother Caleb but I don't know if you might feel a bit uh but let's share it amen on so brother Caleb had engine trouble and he was losing oil in his car so he took it you know you book it into these un to H and there's three test you got to do right three test so he went for the first two test and he confirmed yes your car is losing oil and it's best to get rid of the car so he even spoke to me after one service and he said I'm coming to see your work I think I'm going to trade the sin and probably get a celos or something like that so but you know we've been preaching Faith we've been preaching the supernatural amen and his testimony to me was why is the pastor preaching in this way and you remember I've been telling you find a scripture that pertains to your problem and hold on to that scripture so he very uniquely found the scripture where it talks about 10 virgins and he said Lord I'm not the foolish virgin so why is my possession losing oil amen you see he can make the word to work for you practical he says I'm not the foolish virgins so you know everything that Abraham had and all his possessions were blessed so he says why is my car losing oil I'm not the foolish virgin am so he decided to pray over the car amen then he took it so remember he passed the first two pools now the third test it was was go for but under the third pool there's something greater there amen yes so he goes for that test and he put it on all the machines and the mechanic tells him I don't know what you did but this car is not losing oil anymore amen who touched that engine amen who prayed for that engine amen hallelujah how God can work on engines amen how God can restore missing limbs how God can heal he can deliver he can set free amen and he's still driving the car you put any oil in it now running normal amen praise the Lord so amen why I'm saying that the the engine light and everything was coming on and all of these things but we want to cancel those lights amen yes amen yes we are the light amen hallelujah the only light that should be coming on Amen is the Gospel Light amen amen so we want to speak to that engine speak to all of those things and tell it to behave itself amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen so so my announcement here was that brother Caleb is not here but he is here amen praise the Lord amen then brother s is not sure he's got the flu amen we want to remember him in prayer amen that the Lord can touch him deliver him set him free amen hallelujah amen just want to read this quote very quickly and here the prophet is saying now and I was thinking can I read from here or put it back now and I was just thinking a few moments ago upon the subject of Science and I was just thinking out that science how they are taking the natural man and how he's went into research from the fall of the natural and what he has done amen and how little the spiritual man has progressed in the kingdom of God and I was thinking that the natural man went out at the Unseen of his eye and pulled an atom down out of the sky and split that atom in two that destroys human life and if the natural man that knows nothing of God and cannot know nothing of God except he be converted then his soul becomes alive with the supernatural if he could if he could do that in the natural realm what are the man of God to be doing amen yes what are Daughters of God to be doing amen he says my my friends the church is so far behind now I'm reading that as past tense because we are catching up amen amen hallelujah we are progressing in the things of God he said let's pray my that God will move his church up the natural man with the natural resources is getting greater results than people are that call themselves Christian let's press into the Unseen amen the blessings are yours they for you amen I if you say the blessings are for me amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen so I just want to call amen for the pet to come forward and greet the church amen hallelujah amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen let's give my hand as he comes forward amen praise the [Applause] Lord hallelujah bless you God bless you a God bless you Saints Living God the Lord it set me a privilege to be am I do something wrong no God bless you and um I've just got a quote maybe to share with you amen before the preacher comes I I want to steal these thunder cuz he's got the lightning amen so I trust that God will certainly bless you and U um sorry that I was late for the party but by God's grace all things will work together for the good to them that love the Lord so um I had to go via Samaria Johannesburg before I could come to deran amen Jerusalem Hallelujah so may God richly bless you and I thank the Lord for his grace that he's bestowed upon us that we made it in limp mode amen and uh how many of us are still in LMP mode and by God's grace I trust that we will shut down all the lights amen because every light uh on the dashboard was on as it was coming up and uh the Pastor said that he was so surprised to see me and that must have been by faith that I came up amen and I said well that's what it agitate because the mechanic wasn't available that was promised and then um there was no Diagnostics done and that's why we thank God that he is diagnosed the case amen hallelujah and there's nothing that we have to do yes but just simply cling on to that cross am because the cross is where we have been saved by by grace and His abundant grace and I thank the Lord for that so we we came into Durban Amen on three cylinders Justified Sanctified and baptized with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah so we have to get into step amen amen because if we're not into step we are still chugging on cylinders there's no Dynamics then yes and that's why we just need the Dynamics which is that fire power that ignition to spark whatever is there in that octane or whatever in that fuel that octane needs to be have that spark so that we can vroom out of here hallelujah we need faith for the Rapture amen now friends if we don't believe in Divine Healing it's based on the same thing that's right so if we don't have faith for Divine Healing we cannot even believe for a change of the body and this body needs to be changed not overnight or the next day but it will be in a twinkling of an eye it's not a wink Hallelujah so stop winking at the Devil because winking at the Devil brings your sickness brings in epilepsy brings in all kinds of Mind battles but once you stand on the word of God that's where your faith begins amen it's written amen have you ever told the devil it's written because when you say to the devil it's written he will leave you for a season and that's why we thank God we need to come into that season where we can believe all things are possible hallelujah hallelujah so he's saying now how do you how do you know that brother P you know when God uh comes my way by allowing sickness and diseases upon you you know that's for a reason to glorify God not to glorify your faith but to glorify your faith in God and that's where we need to have our faith today is that we win the Rapture or when the last Trump sounds the dead in Christ shall rise first so doesn't matter if you are dead or alive by that faith that you went in the ground if that seed is alive it must come up amen it's not possible that it must lay down amen praise the Lord so I'm not the preacher here this morning but you know when you get something like this amen and something just kicks in so forgive me amen so may God bless you and I'm going to read the quotation and I trust that the Lord will certainly bless you it's a quotation from the Bible and then uh just a portion uh where the Prophet preaches the Bible says Make a Joyful Noise unto God all he lands sing forth the honor of his name and make his praise glorious amen say unto God how terrible art thou in thy works and through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee all the Earth shall worship thee and shall sing unto thee they shall sing to thy name Salah and he says come and see the works of God he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men he turned the sea into dry land and they went through the flood on foot amen hallelujah there did we rejoice in him he ruleth by the by his power forever his eyes behold the Nations let not the rebellious exalt themselves oh oh bless are God you people and make the voice of his praise to be heard amen amen come and see the works of God yes Amen backtracking to verse 5 Psalm 66 so when things start to happen amen Jesus said when they asked him where do you live he said come and see Hallelujah he didn't have an AB Bo that was luxurious or whatever it was it was just something simple and that's what the gospel is all about amen it's so simple that the fool won't hear there won't be an error that the fool will think hey what's happening here no it's so simple believe and it will happen amen amen when the doctor said your your uh spine is shot amen then I said Lord I'm not going to go that way under the knife of that surgeon but I'm going to believe am and a miracle happened that the surgery didn't have to happen because God said so it is written I am the Lord that heals all th diseases if you have a disease if you have an ailment believe all things are possible amen and it will happen because God said so amen yes sir and he said now uh in everlasting life and how to overcome he says as a skeleton sitting in that wheelchair when they wield up here to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ the doctor gave her till morning to live with a cancer eating her up about seven or 8 years ago here she is tonight amen how many could I call that's walked in and out of these doors here that's coming here crippled and afflicted and sick and lame and Halt and blind and everything else has been healed just in this one little door here as a witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus that's what we want to see is the resurrected Lord amen and until you believe it won't happen because your faith is what makes things happen amen praise the Lord amen what ought we to be amen what ought this Tabernacle to be amen now it says Brenham Tabernacle amen but what ought this Tabernacle to be we have to personalize it because it won't work put somebody out there out there it has to come to your door am can somebody say amen amen can everybody say amen amen yes it should be a lighthouse that's sitting in one of the darkest places of the world am Jeffersonville if there ever was a place that needed the gospel it's Jefferson V now put your town there amen don't always look across the sea put your town there put your disease there put your faith there amen that's right but can any good thing come out of Nazareth Earth can anything good come out of Phoenix who's living in Phoenix amen can anything good come out of Phoenix no it's too bad Hallelujah call no man good but your father who is in heaven so if you're born again something good comes out of Phoenix amen and he said come and see that's right the dark spots we don't need the lights in the daytime we need them when it's dark that's where God sends light is in Dark Places it's mighty hard easy to go where everything is running smooth but where she's running hard where the Dark Places e the rough places must I be carried to heaven on a bed of e may God bless you amen I trust that God will shower his grace upon this church that the there will be such a Revival in this place yes Lord amen that there will be a Welsh Revival in every seat Hallelujah so when you ask where's the Revival he will say to whoever ask you that question you have arrived you have arrived cu the Revival is not here it's here that's where it has to start in the heart the battlefield is up there the Mind battles so when that demon powers and anointings come your way Hallelujah remember the jird the jird comes and he doesn't have his own nest he lays his eggs in your nest amen though your eggs might be in your nest that jbird will come and he will hatch first amen the timing is right the devil nose timing so when his egg hatches he will force out your eggs and then your mommy will feed this big J bird to the extent that it will almost kill itself feeding the J Bird's baby and that's what the devil does don't feed the devil amen Keep Your Nest pure and clean and clear yes and be like that eagle that you don't flop your wings when you want to go up higher you just set your wings come under the word of God and raise up and raise up from faith and virtue amen and Temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness and before you know it you in the Heavenly so far that the world can't see you amen and when you look down you see the grace of God Amen you say thank you Lord for picking me up higher and higher and higher and it's so automatic that before you know it you are born again amen may God bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord you appreciate that greeting amen let's give the Lord another good hand up of Praise amen let's all Stand Together amen with into the word of God Amen is we invite our brother Joshua to come and share the word of the Lord amen Bless The Name of Jesus Amen sing abr's blessing Abraham's blessings are mine Abraham's blessings

going out coming in going out [Music] amen amen we thank God may be seated we thank God for his grace and mercy that once again we could be gathered in his place of worship had it not been for his grace where would we be amen yes hallelujah amen amen I'd like to greet brother Pat Nicholson and his wife good to have you home praise God with family and amen good to see you again it's been a while amen but uh just listening to that words of encouragement amen amen it sure lifted my face amen amen you see you preacher can't run away from his calling no matter where you put a preacher he's going to preach amen so God has place these things in the church amen man we know it says where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst amen we believe that amen when we look at that scripture where two or three are gathered these name there I am in the midst so we know when we coming here we know why we coming here yes amen because he said he would be in our midst when we are gathered in his name Hallelujah so when we know that we left home this morning and we left on our journey from our houses we had to dress up we had to get ready we had to live at a specific time we had to put fuel in our vehicles and we had to make the effort to get here we had to get up early in the morning we had to prepare from last night to get ready for this morning service and we know why we coming here amen we know we coming here because of divine appointment and we know that when we come here we are coming to receive of him amen amen yes hallelujah we're not coming here for just to Mark ourselves presently church or to satisfy our religious conscience amen we are here knowing that he is according to his word that he will be here amongst us Amen in the present not in the past reading some historical things about what took place in the past amen but we've come to meet him in the now and I believe that he's here amongst us yes and he's Discerning our hearts he Discerning our thoughts and he's here to meet each one at the point of need God he the same yesterday today and forever yes Lord amen we are believe we are the people of the atonement am amen amen and atonement is not just talking of healing and salvation yes the Bible say seeking first the kingdom of God and is righteousness then and all all other things and all things not some amen and all things shall be added unto you so it's not just only your healing is not just part of the atonement only salvation not part of the atonement only all things amen your financial situation your situation with your car no matter what you're trusting God for today all things thank amen amen of the atonements all blessings belong to you thank you Lord amen it's for the children of God because God knows that we need these things to get by in his life and he will give us the things that we need to get by In This Liv Lord praise the Lord amen we know under the curse we have to toil we have to sweat and that's why we on Earth we to labor but God knows the things that we have off L that's why he said ask in pray whatever things you ask in prayer you shall receive amen what you ask for if you believe amen hallelujah so we have without faith is impossible to serve God so we have to have faith because all the promises in the word is there amen and it settles yes right when he said buy your stripes you wear heal it settled you can't take it away Hallelujah you can't take that word and read it by the letter without faith yes amen you got to believe that word by faith amen wonderful everything is there yes God can't change his word am now now if you you are stepping out of God's path then word is not obligated to you that's right but when you are in his path oh yes Lord in the part of his word then he's obligated to fulfill every part of the word amen amen yes Lord so we believe we come today on that on that uh premise amen amen we have come expecting Jesus we come to this morning amen amen if you stand to our feet take the word of God praise the Lord open to the Book of Genesis amen reading from Genesis 1 from: 26 Genesis 1 verse 26 amen praise the Lord and God said let us make man in our image I want you to put this in your context this morning image the word image put the word image in your conscious now God is saying let us make man in our image so that image has to be God amen amen nothing less yes amen after our likeness and let them have dominion you see to have dominion you have to be in the image of God amen amen over the fish of the sea over over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creeped upon the Earth so God created man in his own image he never he never took you and said let me make you an image after the Angels or after something else but after his own amen praise the Lord because in the back part of God's mind you always worthy amen he never began in the first place you always was with God in the back part of his mind God had an image of how he's going to project himself through his family through his sons and daughters amen and it was wasn't going to be anything less than God being reproduced amen his own image in the image of God created him male and female created his them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and sub jewi yes and have dominion over the the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth Amen in other words you're going to have dominion you going to now be ruler over all these things yes upon the Earth amen and you're going to be fruitful and you're going to multiply and if you are in my image you came through my spoken word yes so if you're going to be fruitful and multiply you're going to every if you are you going to be M you're going to multiply through the spoken word yes amen amen hallelujah also turn to the Book of Revelation 13:1 and I beheld another Beast coming out of the earth and he had two arms like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exercised all the power of the first Beast before him and causeth the Earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed and he do doth great wonders so that he make it fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beasts now you read the about the first image that God want us to In His Image but here now the second beast has to be in the image of the first Beast here Satan's counterfeit now God knew that he's going to have people in His image so Satan must have people in His image as well am man he must have a system in His image and he had to give life unto the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed so he wanted to have power yes by speaking and he caus it all both small and great rich and poor free and born to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name amen let's pray father we thank you this morning that we could be gathered in this fashion yes Lord yes father we call you on the scene to come and take control of every thought right now bring our thoughts under the Captivity to The Obedience of the word of your word yes Lord Holy Spirit come and take control thou knowest the things that we have need of Lord we pray that you will have the preeminence over all things this morning Father come and speak to every need come and speak to our heart this morning God we Lord we pray that we'll be receptive towards your word this morning and we pray father that when we leave here we'll not be the same again we'll be Lord filled with your word amen and filled with the things that you want us to hear father and we pray father that as this word comes in us he will give us a faith Jesus Faith to go in the Rapture that's what we are striving for Lord we want to go into the Rapture Lord we pray father that we will Lord remembering that your sons and daughters we come this morning Lord Lord knowing that we are living in this age of adoption Lord that all these things would not have been revealed to us had we not come the correct way father but we thank you Lord through your Holy Ghost and through your Sovereign Grace you brought us to your provided place of worship father into the house of Truth and Lord we thank you this morning that we could receive from you now we give you the preeminence we give you all praise we give you all glory and honor in Jesus name amen am amen the Lord amen prise [Music] God praise God amen amen so we find the contrast here we find that God wants to make Man In His Image that was God's plan all along amen so when God made man he made Man In His Image in his likeness amen amen praise God and we find that Satan is also having the contrast Satan is the Contra yes everything that God has Satan wants to have yes amen so want to speak this morning the image of God being manifested upon the Earth amen amen and why why I say why I want to speak on this because it's timely that I speak on this being the ninth month of the year amen there was a time there had to be a season when the angel had to appear to Mary amen amen there was a season when the angel had to appear yes and there was a season when she said be unto me according to Thy word yes and then there was a season that the focus was on Mary yes there was a season this year when the Lord opened up the season the focus was on us getting our lives in order amen amen getting us to take away all doubts amen getting us to take away all unbelief amen amen because why we we are born in the scientific age yes we are trapped living every day in Lea and as much as we don't realize it that every day that when we wake up in the morning we go and read the news we go to our workplaces we go to our school we go to a place of business everything is surrounded in Satan's STP yes he's taking Satan the 6,000 years to create this trap your your entire from the time you are born your entire education system is teaching you that you got to learn you got to study you got to find the job you got to get a house you got to get a mortgage you got to buy this you got to do that and you put yourself in death you're trapped in the system yes that's how Satan is teaching you amen you got to have an education you got to get a certain type of job that is Satan's trap yes and when he got you there he finally got you trapped in his system amen but the word of God come to give us true Freedom amen true freedom is when your identity was given to you amen amen amen yes that you are a supernatural being am trapped in a flesh body yes amen that you are always meant to be in the image of God Amen and meant to be in his likeness meant to have dominion of the earth not to be a slave amen because Satan's system even the mere fact that we are working we are slaves yes because you are slave to an Earthly Master because that's Satan's system that other the system is designed amen and and once you put yourself in debt you got to continue working to get an income to pay those debt which you never will get out of because you got to continue working death working death that is Satan's system but true Freedom come when you realize I don't belong to this world Amen I am not from the pattern of this world Amen I was formed in the image of God meant to subdue the Earth meant to have authority over the Earth amen and because of the fall of Man In the Garden of Eden I was put in this condition but through Jesus Christ amen amen he made a way from me on Calvary and through the atonement now amen I can have dominion again I can come into my rightful position again amen amen now that's the image of God that now been currently manifested upon the Earth yes amen and where man has missed the mark man has missed the key to the age who was the prophet of the age amen they wanted they was lasting after the gifts when he came under the attractions of the gifts but they missed the giver of the gift but if they stayed with the prophet message all he was doing is pointing you to The Giver of the gift hallelujah amen have we received this all these years we were receiving the mechanics receiving the mechanics because why we were infant stage we still have to stay in the presence of the son to be ripened but there comes a time when you come to maturity there comes a time when you cannot be in infant change anymore because why the image of God must be manifested on the earth and what is the image of God it is Jesus Christ amen because the world need to see the resurrected Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord amen thank you Jesus thank you amen thank you the prophet of God says why did the sign come what did the churches Mark by what was the sign we know Kan at the Mark that was the sign then what was the sign of the Resurrection yes then what's the church what the church is signed by today the sign of the holy spirit that Christ is not dead amen but he raised from the dead and taken in the church sealing his church that it begins right two boys right there in the Garden of Eden right outside the garden so the true sign is Christ is not de amen amen hallelujah amen now we've been preaching you can't you know we preach the gospel to people but they come the time when the people say but where is the God of this gospel that you preaching amen they don't just want to see the mechanics fair enough I believe you yeah but where is the god of the Bible amen that one that was Healing The Sick that one was making the blind to see the one that raised the Dead the one that cast The Devil where is the god of the Bible Hallelujah then you could tell them about God sent a prophet William brandham this is what he did these are the great Miracles that took place upon the Earth he went seven times around the world and look at the supernatural that took place where is the god of Elijah amen where is the god of William Brandon amen yes yes Lord that's what the world needs to see am time for manifestation amen so the time when you believe this message amen you know Mary could have said when Sarah had a child she had to be with Abraham when others had children a GU had a child with Abraham she had to be with Abraham I haven't been with any man yes it was different for her amen and when you heard this message say but how this Prophet is not on the scene now what made us believe this message yes what made us believe this word because we know every other woman had to go through the way of man had to go man's way it had to come via denomination or via some man-made system but this was different this wasn't a man didn't take any man amen this was Supernatural amen the Bing ground had to be right amen he couldn't involve any man-made system yes amen but by faith you believed it hallelujah amen amen because by faith you believe the Angel's message amen and by when you receed that word you said be it unto me according to Thy word amen and then and we know when the angel of God comes down now to manifest himself amongst you to make it a a reality to make him a living God amongst you amen he began to deal with you yes and the focus was on you amen so 9 months God has given you time amen because why everything had to be right the atmosphere to be right to bring for to reproduce Christ the atmosphere to be right am there have to be a preparation because the body had to come and and partake of certain things eat certain food amen the body had to take care of itself Amen to get itself ready Amen to reproduce Christ amen yes Lord amen but they come the time where now hallelujah amen they have to change their position yes they have to go Joseph had to take her on the camel and take her to another position amen because why you have to take her there because now it's time when now Mary is becoming uncomfortable as well it's not easy for her because it's the time to deliver so things don't be the ministry will make you comfortable amen because the ministry knows now it's time to move another plac amen it's time to bring Christ hallelu it's not going to make you to be comfortable the ministry is not yet to make you think everything is Ros around here no just like the message the eagle stir at a nest why would the mama Eagle come and stir up that nest because the little iglet was becoming comfortable Mama keep feeling it keep feeling it and now we know it's getting fit it's becoming too comfortable but it comes a stage you're no longer infancy amen it comes a stage where you need to be fruitful you need to multiply you need to relish the Earth you need to subdue all things amen amen the little Eagle need to come out am so Mama Eagle need to make it uncomfortable amen come to ruffle the The Nest to but make it uncomfortable it's going to stir up the nest and that's what the ministry is doing through the Holy Ghost amen he stirring up the nest amen not making your life comfortable on this Earth not making your Christian Life to be Rosy no faith without works is dead God gave Israel the inhabitance amen he said go and possess the land yes but it wasn't easy it took a part on them amen amen they had to go and work that land yes they had to go drive out all those hites parasites jdes all those things from the land they to go fight and slay the enemy they to have no mercy for the enemy amen God never called us to be mer to be sorrowful for the sinful conditions that we had for sinful past that we had he never called us to be sorrowful over but go and drive it out drive out all unbelief amen drive out all the thing that is keeping you out bound drive out all the things that are stopping you from obtaining your inheritance amen amen they are to go and they had to go and work that land they are to cultivate that land but everything they touch prospered amen amen yes Lord so when you take God's word when you go now into the land of his word and you start taking the word and you start now utilizing that word cultivating that word amen it will prosper amen amen you have success in his word amen but if you just want to sit back and said no I'm happy I'm getting fed by the preachers I'm happy with that God didn't ask for that yes amen amen the book of Colossians 115 says who is the image of the invisible God the first born of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth yes visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and before him amen and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence amen for it pleased the father in him should all fullness dwell and Romans 8:29 says for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren yes so you see that God wants us to come into this image amen and that image is Christ yes yes amen because remember Mary did not trade Christ she was only the carrier yes of the created one God created in Mary the complete embryo yes she was just the the carrier she's not the Creator yes and you are just carrying you when you receive this word you're just carrying this word by the time when he comes forth it got nothing to do with you amen it's got nothing to do with your human abilities amen amen you just received it you said be unto me according to Thy word so it's it's it's actually some you see within you you're subjecting this flesh now because some from within the flesh something must burst forth amen oh yes amen Christ must burst forth that when the people look at you when this world looks at you they can't see you amen all they see is Christ in you Am Lord the world might be so confused amen that when I look at this person all I see is Jesus Christ everything that the Bible speaks about Jesus Christ I see it in this people hallelujah this is a different type of people what type of people are they yes amen why they confounding me amen in the things I say they are confounding me Hallelujah because and they astonished by the things you are saying yes I am telling the people are telling you oh P did you see the economic crisis did you see

the Lord there's going to be a resurrection one of these days amen I'm going to see my loved one one of these days why rejoicing you are different people you are different species Hallelujah that is why you have to be born again yes that is why we cry out you must be born again amen because the first nature the adamic nature the first Nature by sin it puts your flesh body in this earth amen and his flesh body is everything against God amen amen hallelujah the first the first body is a beastly nature amen but when you have that new birth amen hallelujah oh it brings forth the spirit man and now it subdues this Earth amen that Spirit man must have dominion over this Earth amen hallelu amen that Spirit man needs to have dominion that's the image amen that's the image of Christ that has to have dominion over this Earth because this is the enemy amen this is the enemy that wants to rule amen this one cannot have rulership this must become the tail the spirit man becomes the head of this body amen subdue it amen and then this body is being influenced by powers and principalities and rules of Darkness because Satan have got the medium now through the fourth dimension through communication Satan has spread forth amen the all of the hell is Unleashed upon the Earth using every communication system that he can to to subdue this body amen but when the image of Christ bursts forth amen it will bring this body under subjection Hallelujah and brings all things under subjection so you can have dominion again amen amen because if you can't stop his body how you going to rule the Earth he said don't you know the righteous don't you know the weak the meek shall inherit the earth yes amen you can inherit the earth you can have dominion over all things but you have to start off with this body amen amen you got to sub this body you got to bring it under control right here in the battleground of the Mind amen pull it in with the word of God P it in with Fai when doubt is trying to come in when Satan is bringing all negative things Satan is trying to tell you amen through the doctor's report yeah amen he wants to invite that sickness in your life amen and then you

Street Earth is taken out amen Lord hallelujah yes Lord we got to drive our unbelief sometimes we got to be arrogant in the way we drive because Satan is now the way he manifest himself s and they want you to you know sympathize Satan wants you to sympathize with with his demons we can't sympathize with demons amen amen thank you Lord Hebrews 12:23 says to the general assembly and Church of the first born Hallelujah which are written in heaven amen yes and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect amen amen praise the Lord the Church of the first born of the new creation amen Colossians 3:23 says and whatsoever ye do do it utterly as to the Lord amen and not unto men amen amen so what whatever you do whatever you do in his life amen everything that you are doing and this is on 3:23 whatever you're doing you do it heartily to the Lord hallelujah you know it's like Caleb's fa with Joshua and the true meaning of Caleb in the Hebrew tongue not that in the Greek the Greek means dog but in the Hebrew tongue it means wholeheartedly yes that is the true meaning of Caleb yeah so when you do something Caleb's thing with Joshua that mean the church staying with the Holy Ghost amen you do it wholeheartedly hallelujah amen you don't be halfhearted about the things of God yes Lord you live out everything and that's why Abraham could only have his Blessing when he was totally separated from all unbelief Lord he sympathized him with lot didn't bring him his Blessing until he was totally separated from lot amen separated from all his family and then he comes and God gives him his full blessing and every son and daughter coming after that must be separated from all unbelief yes yes Lord because the things that you are receiving are art for the people of the flesh to believe absolutely yes that's right because these things are paradoxes yes the things that God doing amen John 14:12 says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also amen and Greater Works than these shall he do amen because I go unto my father and whatsoever he shall ask in my name that will I do amen that the father may be glorified in

Nation tongues and Kings amen yes how are you going to do that that is now taking the scripture from Genesis 1 amen be fruitful and multiply have dominion again yes because if you take Mark 16 that is now having Dominion yes amen because now the sick is recovering you're having dominion over the sickness amen the serpent from cannot harm you yes you can drink any daily thing cannot AR you that's having Dominion again amen amen he says in the message the seed is not H with a shock he says now notice but at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again yes and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the first strength as it was when he was here on Earth amen this is the Greater Works now John 1412 because it it must be manifested as it was when he was here on Earth yes Amen manifested in the same way yes doing the same things that he did when it was here on Earth amen cuz Hebrews 138 say Jesus Christ the same yesterday to today and forever amen you know he says here it reminds me of a fellow in Florida not long ago he was talking said he had a shev rolled car that went out on him in Florida and said he took it to the garage and this mechanic was going long there along there going along there and and he got everything set together and he couldn't get it to start he put everything in it that he could he renewed all his different things but something another it just wouldn't work and he couldn't get it started so the mechanic was there yes right and he and he started putting things together in other words the word was bringing us back Church order and Doctrine how a Christian should be bringing us back restoring us back to all things right he put everything in it that he could he renewed all these things but something another just wouldn't work and he couldn't get it started it just kept trying and trying the little mechanic was nervous run around all over the building picking up this getting preach getting getting things getting things right amen and the man standing saying I'm waiting on my car sir I'm late can't you get it he said I'm doing all I can to real Lous and car on and he walked along directly A well-dressed gentleman amen when you hear the word gentleman who you think about the Holy Spirit walked up and looked at him a few moments and he said to the mechanic after he let let him butt his head around a little while he said why don't you just touch this we not getting any current yes so we had everything right the mechanics you had everything in position but something was a Miss amen but now this now the mechanic can't tell you this yeah you need the Holy Ghost to come down am Amen to come on the scene amen so he said I never thought of that you see your human mind will never make to think of these things amen so he just turned the other little thing ever what it was there and he got the current in the car started everything was there the word was there but he needed this the Holy Ghost to come down the ghost to drop down amen he turned around and said who are you you know who he was the chief engineer of the general motor he made the thing he designed it who made us in the image of God Amen Sons and Daughters of God he formed us he made us Amen in his very image Hallelujah he designed us so he knows what we need to be manifested in this hour than in this hour brother when we wonder what's the matter with our Revival what's the matter with the message world yes what what got the people all all just forgetting about uh the real manifestation of God and just focus and happy and satisfied with having the word having quote after quote yeah we got the material and everything we got the mechanics we have we got the the the message the entire table of the message we got all the quotes we got all the word but he said where is the Dynamics that's what we need to move Jesus Christ on the scene what's the matter I tell you one year today Hallelujah call the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that can touch the Dynamics he is the Dynamics of the mechanics amen he is the Dynamics of the word amen amen the Holy Ghost must come and touch the word bring life to the word the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life amen I was telling the brothers the other day when I was in the bible college and I went to the this one conference they had this preacher from America they used to call him the walking Bible he used to B the whole Bible and he was called The Walking Bible and I was impressed when I saw him I was so fascinated I said wow I would love to be like this person you know what ability this is to you know the way you can just quote the scriptures and I was really Inus and you know I was so fascinated over it but he's talking about the Trinity he's Bing the entire Bible he can see the scriptures he can he knows it just like that you know the Hebrew you know the Greek but he's talking about the Trinity God he's talking about the Trinity baptism then when I got baptized and came into the message of the I said I wonder if I can just present this just a baptism what this person that can B the entire Bible can see and read between the line amen but when he the holy spirit is come he will show you all he will make that Bible Alive Hallelujah the thing that you're reading there yes you know like I say when we went to high school when we started High School from grade that I'm standard eight grade 10 now is it called grade 10 yes so we went there with first time we Shakespeare now Shakespeare language was foreign to the English that we speak we speak falo English common English now Shakespeare was high English so it was when you started to read Shakespeare it was difficult to understand it but when they told you go buy the study guide when you bought the study guide it Mak Shakespeare so interesting and it you began to see what Shakespeare was meaning in his plays and so forth you began to understand it so just like that when when you are reading the Bible and it not come for the message of the hour yes amen I did not come to the opening of the word to come and make this word alive to us come and show you what is the theme amen and Jesus is the principal theme of The Bible amen amen amen and make this word a living word to you amen make this word a present word to you not a religious book or book of history but a prophetic a living prophecy amen a lively word amen the Lord thank you Jesus amen so that's what we have today the Holy Ghost comes down yes all we had all the mechanics and he put everything in place but something was a m yes there was a time and season amen there was a time and season when Mary had to come and say be unto me according to Thy word amen but there's also a time and season when she had to move yes to another place yes to come into Bethlehem the house of God's bread Amen to come into the place that God has pre-ordained to be amen amen to come into a position in the Life in other words she to come into a certain position yes and this position will bring forth the Christ amen amen this position will utter in the Christ yes and then when Christ comes on the sin the focus is no more on Mary yes all you see now is Christ amen all you began to see yes is Christ yes there was Christ in infancy but it was Christ now coming to Ministry amen when he when he goes down and receives the Holy Ghost and comes to the River Jordan amen then is all about Christ amen so it comes the time where the world must see the Greater Works now which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen you know this Bible has everything that we need am people might say Marx no but that was you know we are different time now we've got all the word yes we've got all the word but why you you talking about healing and Diving how you going have rapturing faith yes if you can't have faith for the TR he said that we can't take out what he said the prophet said if you can't have faith for the truth how you going to have rapturing faith because rapturing faith is Divine Healing is a is a sign it's only an example of how the body can be healed yes but is a temporary sign yes but they must be where are with the Redemption of our bodies we are waiting for this body to be completely healed because by sin is bringing is bir in death yeah by the very nature of the sin act it is birthed out naturally in death yes so now we are waiting for the Redemption of this body that every day as we living the cells are dying yes but but the change of body the Mortal will put on immortality yes amen and those that are in the grave the corrupt the corruption will put on incorruption amen amen so that's what we are waiting for so if somebody come and say take out the word he said to them no all word is inspired of God Amen yes but you know one time there was this lady and a son went to Bible College Prophet gave this illustration yes and he went to this Bible College Study some theology yes then she was at back home and she got sick one night with pneumonia and then they sent a message to a son your momy sick but just get ready we'll give you the news what the story so he waited and waited no news in the morning they said she's fine she's okay yeah so he didn't worry about it after about a year he came home and he began to question his mom that night they called me and said you were sick what happened so she told him you know there's people here they was having some service up there and they heard I was sick and they brought the the preacher to come and pray for me and the preacher when he praying a he said he took Mark 16 yes amen he said Mark you don't believe in all these things in Bible College we thought you know that was for some other time that's not inspired that is not inspired then she said praise God and said now you're behaving like this people he said no I just thinking son if that wasn't inspired and healed me how much more the other things I saw the other inspired amen yes how about the other promises amen yes amen yes so that's the god that we serve amen yes praise the Lord hallelujah wonderful thank you amen so what is Christ wants now he wants this Oneness with us amen wonders where you separate where just so much inwin with him that I said as I as the father was in me and now I in you and the world must be conformed they can't see that the world don't understand understand that but he said that day you will know yes but to do that you have to come in the W he said the prophet of God say and if you know this hour that Eve was United with Adam she became part of him Genesis 127 he said he created male man male and female created them now the man both male and female when he come to bring in the spirit of feminis and masculine then God took from his side a r did you notice the body part was a byproduct not the spirit right the body part of the woman was a by product after the creation had been finished God took from the side of Adam a rub and made a woman but not the spirit the spirit was part of Adam yes it had nothing to do with us yes amen so therefore he took Adam to be first person yes for God had to put him in a sleep and then take out Eve had to come out amen amen the feminist part of Adam and Eve was formed God had to put Christ to sleep on Calvary yes amen amen and from his side come forth the bride amen amen thank you Jesus but it nothing to do with her yes amen it's his spirit that will come back on the day of Pentecost and inaugurate the church The Same Spirit of Christ that's why you can't have a man made system yes not the spirit of man no dogmas no Creeds this is God and God Alone this is part of the I will Covenant I will present myself a glorious Church Without spot without wrinkle without blemish L amen I will present a super Church a super raise an invincible Army amen amen hallelujah now don't you see the great picture we in flesh are different we like a byproduct a created being by only withlock but in spirit we are Sons and Daughters not some other Spirit but the spirit of the Living God Amen we are in his likeness yes in his unity in the perfect image of the Living God Lord because we become son and daughters amen not separated by The Same Spirit the same God the same person join in wedlock to the Eternal see how God planned it that we should be not a different but him not some other being of some other tribe but a real Union and offspring of the almighty done by a holy uniones now the body come from Mother and Father but the spirits come from God am God separating himself as Adam was separated Amen on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the pull of fire separating itself and sitting upon each other each member of the church God putting himself together then with that group of people together what does he do brings back the unified body of the Lord Jesus coming together amen thank it says joined in Heavenly wedlock to the Eternal God part of him part of God in flesh I became I become Brenham because of my father Brenham you become part of your father and mother but in spirits we become in Union with God is part of God amen hallelujah amen that is why God couldn't lose any one of us amen if you're part of God you can't be lost God can't separate himself from himself yes amen that's the reason the spirit cannot die amen he that believeth on me has everlasting life and in the image that he is here on Earth and in his likeness I'll raise him up in the last days not a spirit being for we'll have a body like like God's glorious body the glorified body of the Lord Jesus raised up in that image Jesus said going to the grave of Lazarus I am the resurrection and life he that believeth in me though he be dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth in me not on me but in me amen being in him believing if yet abide in me and my words in you in him believing oh my I hope the spir Holy Spirit gets that right down to you amen now you're the little flock that's why through the week praying and asking God I choose the St to show you where we stand believing in him amen you cannot believe in him until you come in him or he comes in you then you believing in him then you have eternal life you're believing on him until you receive eternal life then eternal life is gone life in you then you believing in amen am Y in me I in you that ye may be one father even as you are you and I are one God in Christ Christ in the church amen just as we are one so they be one and how can you be one if you abide in me my words in you see abide my words in you then ask what you will for it isn't you no more it's the word that in you and the word is God Amen so when you have the word abiding in you which is Christ abiding in you when you asking now of that same word it will he must Grant it to you amen because it's not you it's him amen it's his words and he's obligated to the words amen that's what the proph of God says if you want God to do something then you stay in God's part that he's obligated to you yes but you come out of his part which is his word then God is not obligated to you amen but if you want something from God you stay within his word in the confines of his word yes but once you come out of his word you already feel condemned you won't be able to even ask him yes unless you're an unbeliever who has no remorse and just once and once and once he just like the the denomination they just want and want and want from God but they don't want to be part of him they don't want him in her they don't want to take up his name they don't want to be obedient to his word but they just want the benefits of the atonements but they don't want to be part of the atonment they don't want the the person that gave the atonement to be part of them that's right but they only want the benefits but they are enjoying the benefits because the rain falls on the just and the unjust but why are we deprived why are we deprived because it's falling because of you yeah yes the rain is falling for the just amen so don't look at them and say God is blessing them yes they are going and claiming your blessing right it's falling for you because you see some of them they learned the law of God yes they sold into the kingdom and I'm not talking only material sewing they're sewing their time they're investing in they're taking the right scriptures the right things that they need and they're using it and they're getting those benefits but it's actually meant for you amen they are doing it to the wrong motives yes they are doing it lusting after the thing they want to do it to to to follow to be blessed only your material things to be Covetous right when God wants to bless you he doesn't want you to bless you to be a Covetous he wants to bless you he wants to bless you so you can be a blessing and others so that you can first bless his kingdom you can first bless his people amen because that's one of the secrets of God's blessing if you want to be blessed he said first bring into my store test me amen that's the one scripture God say test me then he says You must now give unto others he said give to the poor give to the needy God is showing you the things and remember we we taught you the the the meth of God when you give it's not separating yes when you give it's multiplying it's multiplication and that goes for material things or spiritual things it's always multiplying it just when a preacher is preaching out putting that effort to go and study to to wait upon the Lord and pre he's giving out but he's actually multiplying because the Holy Spirit come down and replenishes hallelujah amen so it takes a part on you though amen you can't just say God has blessed me with all his Blessing and I'm not taking the step of Faith amen you must take that step of Faith to go do your part yes it must take a work on your part yes you got a friend that's in hospital you got a family member that's sick now you you're sitting at home you praying for him but the scripture is Mark 16 the said go lay hands on the S they shall recover am these are unbel your family members that unbelievers now the reason why that they maybe they in sickness but God want to manifest himself maybe God want to show it's a time now God wants to demonstrate that these are people that maybe you didn't look at them right maybe you thought what they believing but yet I'm going to show that I am with them amen amen he said if you don't believe these things believe the works that amen so maybe you never believed all the things they told you all these years but now believe the works that they do amen so God is going to present these opportunities to you yes that's right amen yes right I'm trying to find the quote where he's talking about bully Graham got put in the situation bully Graham he said he's talking about going and doing the greater work yes he said the greater work wasn't just preaching the gospel yes right so buly is preaching the gospel people are getting saved but now he got confronted with a situation yes but someone said right Jesus did this things in the Bible now let's see this things they said you can't just preaching doing the Greater Works is now having what Jesus did you must do it also that is The Showdown yes yes he saying you you you are preaching about Jesus amen you're preaching about Jesus but where is these Greater Works that's right oh sorry where is what Jesus did in the Bible I can't see it now your claim to be have the message of the hour we claim to be going in a Rapture but where is the work of Jesus Christ amen that's right we must see it amen you're claim to believe this Prophet William brandham yes William brandham all see God through him but where are the works that William random did where are the things amen amen praise the Lord amen he said two lights can shine at the same time amen there can be a church light and God's light shine at the same time it got to be God's light putting out the church life yes so if the church world now is coming to the stage and expanding we can't be keeping quiet that's right God has given us the time to say prophesy again amen and that's how you put out the church life and that's exactly what's taking place today God is separating churchism from his is light of the promised word of this hour that we living in that's the truth for you might not want to believe that but you just wait and find out if it's so or not don't wait you get better in it right now until there's a CH chance to get in the word is light when it's Vindicated amen sorry the word is light when it's Vindicated until the word it promise for the day is Vindicated then it's not light it cannot be if God said let there be light and no sun come in existence there is no sign of light but when God said let there be light and there was light when God promised a messiah messiah come then his word was fulfilled and he was the light of the hour when he promised Noah and he promised the others and on down there was the light of the hour and there is the light of the hour today that Jesus Christ is the power of it that Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection his word that promised for this day am the works that I do shall you do also greater than this year shall you do for I go to the father Greater Works greater things than he do do you believe it I believe it seems humble it seems like it goes over the top of people's head look when he was here on Earth how could you do Greater Works he said I've trying at that many times more by the same thing greater he said in St John 14:12 Greater Works than this shall you do did you not this when he went to make water into wine he took water first and already created substance and turned it into wine when he fed 5,000 people he took a fish that once swam in the water broke it and in out and multiplied creation he took bread at once wheat backed into baked into bread broke it and H it out to the people and it return back again and multiplied creation but in the last days where there is no sign of creation he speaks it into creation am anyhow shows to be the same God that was in the beginning amen amen he can create squirrels he can create whatever he wants to because he is God am greater things and this will you do for I go unto my father the word is infallible and it has to be manifested has to be fulfilled greater than this shall you do not multiplying but speaking out into creation am why to come in the hour of the third po year because God had to bring man back into His Image First and into Dominion again and he couldn't bring back to Dominion until he went to Calvary yes and take off the curse of sin amen and then now he bring man into Dominion again and he said now you go back to what it was in the beginning as in the beginning he said let it be let there be light and it was light so man can now speak into existence and here come a prophet of the SC because why the son of man ministry again amen amen and now God bringing back man into that Dominion again back into the correct Adam condition that Satan taken away from him and he says now speak the word amen amen and that was an example in there was that son then there must be others following amen amen that was a she way before us then there must be others following that coming back into the image again coming back into the minion again back into possession again speaking paradoxes amen amen the power of the spoken word which is the Original Seed because we come with the original word am we have received the original word and when we receive the original word that is the Original Seed amen and the and the Original Seed is the spoken spoken word that is the Original Seed amen and that is why the sh could not be here with the seed because they don't want the original it wasn't meant for the original word but when you come into the original again amen you have the power of the spoken word in your presence yes but who it is it is Christ in you yes it is his word and you are just speaking portraying Christ so in other words it's not you that speak it it's not I that live but Christ live so when it comes to the power of the spoken word not you that's speaking it's that Christ that in you amen that is speaking out his own word amen and if he speaks out his own word he's obligated to his own word he must manifest it must come to whatever it said must come to pass amen amen CU Christ is one with word yes amen oh here's the quote here let me read it for you how he said it he said that's the way it come today with many of our people with many of our churches we know that the Bible teaches that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we know that the Bible teaches John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also Greater Works than this shall you do because I go to the father now we've been interested in other things not taking warning not taking heed we have run but not taking heed to the message we've gone but didn't know what to tell when we get there a few days ago when the churches of this world when the Christian churches were brought to a shame and disgrace when the honorable and notable and God-fearing servant Billy Graham was brought face to face with the Bible he had run but had forgotten the message when that Madan stood in his face to his face and told him if this be the word of God let's see you make it manifest he had run well great Revival great things but when it come to the place he didn't have the message I am risen from the dead yes I am the same yesterday today and forever amen we can't be quoting Hebrews 13:8 and believing the same message and not having the manifestation of it yes we cannot say Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and not having the manifestation of Jesus reproduced through our lives Hallelujah so he says running physically fine churches many members great denomination but that's not the key notes Watch What followed and the sign shall follow them that believe go but didn't know what to tell so go into all the world preach the gospel right but when you preach the gospel signs must follow yes so when you're presenting the gospel out to your neighbors to your friend to your workplace the signs must follow God never sent a man L he give him something to say God always confirms his word go going but not able to tell where you get when you get there no matter how big your revivals are how big your church is how much your denomination predominates the other if you haven't got something to tell them what have you got but a bunch of people gathered together like a lunch we got a message to tell the world Jesus is alive he's not dead taking he to the message if you don't have that then you got a lar yes amen he says these works that I do shall you do also a greater than this shall you do I took a fish to make a f to make a fish you don't even have to have a fish he's still God he's still the same son the same Son of God to take a fish of a fish it's the same Son of God today these works I do shall shall you also even greater than this shall you will you do it will be magnified yes greater than this shall you do and people refuse to see it the Greater Works amen so look at where we are now amen let's take diagnosis of ourselves of our own selves we received the mechanics all these years we received the word all these years then go God has come down and brought us to a stage where now the focus was on us on our own selves yes getting our Earth's rights yeah and telling us now you need to subdue the Earth because the earth now is the problem yes you you was meant to have dominion over this Earth You was only put in this flesh body because of the first condition but under your new bir words I put my spirit in you and my spirit in you will make you now bring this flesh man under subjection amen bring this Earth this nature this old nature the sticky nature under subjection have dominion over it it cannot have dominion over you because the moment you let it have dominion over you it will bring you in a backl condition amen it will it will feed itself it'll be it'll overpower the spirit man in you but you want to feed the the spirit of man more but God has been taking us through these things through these years yes through these N9 months taking us to separate from the things of the flesh things that will defile this body what is that things that take away the time of God yes amen your time with the worldly thing your time with that little has presented to you because as we said Satan is working through communication he's communicating things through the media through social networks to the people that surround you your educational system he's got your mind so inre because why he is this got the people trapped around the world he's got his own to bring his system in place he had to bring he to trap everybody because why when Nimrod was on the earth in the time of Babylon Nimrod come from the lineage of M from Kush but we know that that that that lineage comes forth it was a serpent seed lineage and it was serpent Satan's lineage to bring forth the and infiltrate the human race and he began to trap the people in his things so just like that now Satan has got the people in his web he's got you trapped to your in everything that you do right now okay if the economy crash all your money is the bank what's going to happen to your money your property will be gone because it can take away your property that's what the Bible says in the last days you can't buy you can't sell you can't trade it's coming to the time but thank God he's given us his promises and before he comes to the Crux we'll be gone yes but we are experiencing these things we can see the things coming in but he's given us the promises of his word he said ask what you will seek he first the kingdom of God and his righteousness yes and all the thing shall be added unto you when the time was famine was there and Elijah was there on the scene then he went to the widow woman and he said make me make me a bread a cake first amen the last bit of substance that she had it took it to was obedient to the word that came to the prophet and because of her obedience behind closed doors God blessed the household amen so if you are obedient to God's word god will bless your household amen and that is following God's word keeping his word amen so we find that God has taken us to all of this we did all those things on ourselves but why was he doing this he wanted to he wants to manifest himself through US amen so the Bing ground was right so when he got the Bing ground right he brought us through where we was but now it's time for Mary for us to be of the scene amen now is the time for Christ to be displayed amen let your light so shine before men amen take up your cross and follow me let Christ be displayed upon the Earth through you and I let the world see Jesus Christ again this world have no hope yes this world have no solutions to their problems but you have the answers you have the one you are the one the Bible says when you are filled with the Holy Ghost you should be crying and sign for the abomination of the Lost we read in the starting of how Satan now got his image amen the second beast will speak for the first Beast amen we know that's speaking of America and through America comes all the media comes all the systems of this world all the laws and the land and everything it's coming through there cuz she's going to be the mouthpiece for the first drag for the first beast and we can see that all is said everything is set now everything everything is set for Satan to come amen so just like that everything must be said for us to leave the Earth but before we leave the Earth we must pass on the B Because Why Moses and Elijah going to come down and there must be a people and they going to be preaching that there was a people that took a Rapture yes they're going to believe they're going to be preaching this message to the people and the people must receive the Holy Ghost those Jews those 144 Jew th000 Jews must receive the Holy Ghost but they won't receive it to our preaching They will receive it by their own Prophet because why they calling them to the Feast of atonement under that seven trumpet but between that six and seven trumpet he comes down amen for us amen he comes down for us can give us his word and they're going to be he's going to tell them before the seven trumpeted there was a people yes there was a people when after World War II when Naomi was coming back in Homeland root was also he was bringing root yes he brought root along and they going to be rejoicing you know why they going to Rejoice this time because hey you mean to say our blindness sa people our blindness in part made people get saved amen that's true their blindness through day blindness we are saved amen so you can see where we are now and Satan got everything ready now he's got all the system the the world is in a Sodom condition Sodom is legalized sin is glorified sin is glorified and things of anything of God right now is bad badly spoken of ill spoken of in fact they they'll speak about religion and spiritual things but not God because Sin is Sin is actually glorified right now right and even even the unbelievers people who don't believe sorry people that don't believe the message can see there's something wrong now there going to be time where lot of foolish virgins start catching a wake up things are happening but it's going to be too late let's hope the foolish virgins are not lying in the message trying to get the oil when it's too late trying to get enough oil when when it's time for them to get the oil and keep the oil keep themselves full with the Holy Ghost they wasn't doing it but when when you come to the time of realizing hey we can see things around and now when I come and get it it's going to be too late this is the hour when you hear his voice other not your heart as in the day of provocation amen my God richly bless you as we come into His Image amen yes amen praise the Lord amen can I have the musicians come over amen amen amen let's stand amen can we sing that song created me a clean up me Clean Heart oh Lord and re right Spirit Within Me cre me a clean oh Lord and when you Spirit Within [Music] Me
