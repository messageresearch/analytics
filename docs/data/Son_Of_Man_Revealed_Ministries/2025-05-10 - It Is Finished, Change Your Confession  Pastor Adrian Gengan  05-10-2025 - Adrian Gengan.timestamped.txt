[0:00] Let's go to Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10
[0:02] with the Josh. You get my notes. Amen.
[0:04] Praise the Lord. Ephesians chapter 2
[0:06] verse 10.
[0:15] For we are his workmanship.
[0:19] Now we got to tie this with Genesis 1 26
[0:23] 27 when he said let us make man in our
[0:26] image.
[0:27] &gt;&gt; Then he did it right in 27. He actually
[0:29] did it.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; God created man. Now he's saying we are
[0:32] his workmanship created in Christ Jesus.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; Take some time to think about that.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; We were created in Christ Jesus.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; So if Jesus is perfect,
[0:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:54] &gt;&gt; I am perfect. Amen.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; Now, I know your church thinking and
[0:58] your uh creed and your thing think
[1:00] things that you still need to do
[1:01] something to be perfect.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; That is a lie.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; We are already perfected in Christ.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; We have already made the rapture.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; Christ has already predestinated us.
[1:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; So, I want to take that denominational
[1:18] concept and chop it now to the root.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; Pluck it by the root.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:25] We are his workmanship created in Christ
[1:28] Jesus unto good works which God had
[1:32] before orained that we should walk in
[1:34] them.
[1:35] &gt;&gt; So how about we walk in perfection?
[1:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not striving to be holy.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; Because that's that's striving TO DO
[1:42] GOOD WORKS.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; I AM ALREADY HOLY BECAUSE CHRIST IS
[1:46] HOLY.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; I AM ALREADY PERFECT BECAUSE CHRIST IS
[1:48] PERFECT.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. Thank you.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank
[1:54] you, Lord.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 2 and verse 6.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; And hath raised us up together.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; And made us sit together
[2:10] &gt;&gt; in heavenly places.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; In Christ Jesus.
[2:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; We've been talking about the headstone.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; We've been talking about how we have now
[2:21] connected to the headstone. Yes,
[2:23] &gt;&gt; we find that's called heavenly places.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; And we are finding that it is in Christ
[2:28] Jesus.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; So the rip that was taken from Jesus has
[2:32] been put back.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not disconnected from Jesus.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; I am connected with Jesus.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[2:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Lord is blessing through
[2:44] the reading of his word. You may be
[2:45] seated. Hallelujah. You know this
[2:47] morning I feel such a fresh anointing.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I feel like there's a shift in the
[2:53] atmosphere this morning.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; I feel like [applause] all that we have
[2:56] labored through the months. Amen.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit's about to shift the
[2:59] gear this morning.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But that's ACCORDING TO MY
[3:03] EXPECTATION.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; AND AS THE PASTOR OF the church, I'm
[3:06] here to lead you in a VISION THIS
[3:07] MORNING.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. Where there's no
[3:12] vision, THE PEOPLE PERISH.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. We can't be A DEAD CHURCH.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T BE A CHURCH COMING to hear a
[3:18] sermon this morning. BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE
[3:20] A CHURCH. AMEN. WHERE WE BECOME THE
[3:22] WALKING SERMON.
[3:23] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE GO TO CHURCH WEEK AFTER WEEK.
[3:25] THEY GO AND LISTEN TO A SERMON. THEY
[3:27] WALK OUT CONFUSED. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
[3:28] THE PASTOR PREACH.
[3:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise the Lord.
[3:31] &gt;&gt; Thank
[3:33] &gt;&gt; According to me, Revelation 10, the
[3:35] prophet revealed all the mysteries.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:40] &gt;&gt; So what we are saying IS WE ARE MOVING
[3:42] FROM NINE months of teaching, WE HAVE
[3:44] MOVED INTO THE last quarter.
[3:47] [snorts]
[3:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to know this is not a
[3:50] university.
[3:53] &gt;&gt; This is not a university.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; If you want to call it anything, this is
[3:58] a trade school.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; Where whatever you learn, there's a
[4:03] period now where it must be applied.
[4:04] [applause]
[4:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're not going through nine
[4:09] months of teaching and preaching,
[4:11] brother Joshua, for us to not have
[4:13] practical
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'm saying all that we learned
[4:19] we need to apply.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the last quarter, Amen. In this
[4:24] season, you must expect to see the
[4:26] expression of everything we have
[4:28] learned.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; If we spoke about THE OPENING OF
[4:31] DIMENSIONAL DOORS, WE MUST ALREADY WALK
[4:33] THROUGH THAT DOOR.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; If we're speaking about getting INTO
[4:36] HEAVENLY PLACES, NOW IS THE TIME YOU'RE
[4:38] GOING TO SEE THE EXPRESSION OF US
[4:40] SITTING TOGETHER in heavenly places. How
[4:42] will it manifest? IN THE POWER AND THE
[4:44] DEMONSTRATION OF THE WORD. IN THE POWER
[4:46] AND demonstration of the Holy Ghost.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Thank you, Lord.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; So all you have believed for and
[4:56] prepared for will come to pass in this
[4:59] season.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[5:02] &gt;&gt; Now remember what the prophet of God
[5:04] says. He says, "A prophet is a modern
[5:06] day preacher."
[5:08] &gt;&gt; All that you believe for and all you
[5:10] prepared for will come to pass in this
[5:12] season.
[5:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you Lord. Thank you
[5:15] Lord.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A farmer don't plant and
[5:19] water and all the time of preparation
[5:22] not expecting an harvest.
[5:24] &gt;&gt; He is expecting that what he has
[5:26] planted.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; What he has watered
[5:29] &gt;&gt; what he has labored.
[5:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pastor Ronnie planted.
[5:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; The five ministry is watering.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; And we expecting to see an harvest.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[5:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[5:43] Excuse me because I don't preach high
[5:45] and fancy stuff.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; I preach very practical that even the
[5:48] children must understand what I am
[5:50] saying.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when you leave this place,
[5:53] I want you to know that you have been
[5:54] blessed.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; So this is the time and this is the
[6:00] season where the revelation of the word
[6:03] will produce a transformation of your
[6:04] mind.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; And in us, we will start to walk in what
[6:09] we believe.
[6:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:12] Hallelujah. So what we need to uncover
[6:14] first
[6:15] &gt;&gt; is who we really are.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; Because unless we know who we really
[6:18] are, we can't really have faith.
[6:20] [clears throat]
[6:21] &gt;&gt; The real you was on the inside of that.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; So many times people want to express
[6:32] this flesh. This is who I am.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; They attach it to a family name.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; Me I'm from the Musamis.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; Me I'm from the governors. M
[6:39] &gt;&gt; me I'm from the chetties
[6:41] &gt;&gt; or me I'm from THE GANGS WHOEVER IT IS
[6:43] no we are expressing then just the old
[6:45] cult
[6:47] &gt;&gt; we're not expressing the real me because
[6:49] my gene has a name
[6:51] &gt;&gt; amen
[6:52] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[6:53] &gt;&gt; my gene has an identification
[6:56] &gt;&gt; and genetically my name is Jesus Christ
[7:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[7:03] &gt;&gt; that's right
[7:04] &gt;&gt; genetically my name is Jesus Christ
[7:08] &gt;&gt; praise Praise the Lord.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; So what makes us different from just the
[7:14] church world? Do you know everyone is
[7:16] dying? All of us are dying.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; But we are carrying something eternal
[7:20] within our souls.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; That's the difference between us.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; We may look like everyone else. We may
[7:26] age like everyone else. But we are not
[7:28] like everyone else.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; It says a Christian does not die.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; First thing is we mustn't consider this
[7:37] was change our language now to say we
[7:39] die. We don't die.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; The Bible when IT'S REFERENCING DEATH
[7:42] CALLS US ASLEEP.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's no scripture
[7:46] that a Christian dies because he's got
[7:49] eternal life.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; When a sinner dies, he's finished.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; His soul will finally die.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; But when a Christian dies, he's just
[7:58] waiting for Jesus to return back again.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon goes on to say in the
[8:05] interval, your soul is the part of God
[8:08] that's in you.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; Want to resurrect that seed that's been
[8:11] planted for 9 months.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[8:20] Amen. Then the prophet will go on. I'm
[8:22] just trying to show you something here
[8:24] now because people think why do we get
[8:25] sick then if you're saying eternal life
[8:27] is a part of me.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet is saying
[8:30] now. Divine healing and salvation for
[8:33] the soul is not on the same basis.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus died that he might save us. When
[8:40] we saved, we saved eternally.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; I can't be lost.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; Do you know when Jesus saved me, the
[8:48] Bible says while we were yet in sin,
[8:50] Christ died for us.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; He already looked down through the ages.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; And when he died ON CALVARY, HE FORGAVE
[8:56] ME FOR ALL OF THOSE SINS.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; YES, [applause] SIR. I thank you, LORD,
[9:00] THAT THE BLOOD STILL STANDS. OH GOD, I
[9:02] THANK YOU ALREADY FORGIVEN ME OF MY SIN.
[9:05] OH GOD,
[9:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; The devil wants to keep us that WE ARE
[9:09] CONTINUAL SINNERS. NO. WHEN CHRIST DIED
[9:11] for us, HE DID A WORK THAT EVEN ON THE
[9:14] CROSS, WHAT DID HE SAY, BROTHER
[9:16] JAFFFORD? HE SAID, "It is finished."
[9:20] &gt;&gt; We are thinking there's something we
[9:22] need to do.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; There is nothing we can do.
[9:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is not one thing we can do
[9:30] &gt;&gt; to add TO OUR SALVATION.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE ARE IN CHRIST.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; CHRIST DID IT ALL.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; AND NOW WHEN WE ARE CHANGING our
[9:38] mindset, THE KINGDOM OF HELL CANNOT
[9:40] STAND AGAINST US BECAUSE WE ARE NOT
[9:42] DEPENDING ON OUR OWN WORKS, ON OUR OWN
[9:44] HUMANNESS, BUT WE ARE DEPENDING ON WHAT
[9:46] CHRIST has done for us.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; We should NEVER GO TO GOD AND SAY,
[9:54] "LORD, HEAL ME. HEAL ME." YOU ARE
[9:56] NULLIFYING THE WORK ON THE CROSS.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; CHRIST HAS ALREADY HEALED YOU.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; Christ has already saved us.
[10:11] [crying]
[10:11] So Jesus died that he might save us.
[10:14] When we saved, we saved eternally. But
[10:16] when we heal physically, we'll get sick
[10:18] again.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Right? But the soul is THE IMMORTAL
[10:22] PART. HE THAT HEARETH my word believeth
[10:25] on him that sent me, amen, everlast
[10:29] everlasting life, and shall never come
[10:31] to the judgment, but is passed from
[10:33] death unto life. That settles it. Then
[10:35] when we're born again, we're a new
[10:37] creature, and that soul is a part of
[10:39] God, the eternal life that comes from
[10:42] the Greek word Zoe, which means God's
[10:44] own life. That makes us sons and
[10:46] daughters of God. Now, how many of you
[10:48] believe you are sons and daughters of
[10:49] God? Amen.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; He's saying the only way we can become
[10:52] sons and daughters of God in Zoe life is
[10:54] in us.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; So our confession needs to change.
[11:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; If we ARE SONS OF GOD, ZOE LIFE LIVES in
[11:04] me.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're sick in your physical
[11:11] body, until this body has been redeemed,
[11:13] it's subject to sickness again.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; Now pay attention. Your body is subject
[11:20] to sickness again, but there's a price
[11:22] that was already paid for you to receive
[11:25] your healing again.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; Now, here's what I'm trying to convey to
[11:30] you this morning.
[11:32] That everything that we will ever need
[11:35] in this life, Christ has already done it
[11:37] for you.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat and cough]
[11:41] You see, when Christ chose to take you
[11:43] in the rapture,
[11:45] he already knew at the point of your
[11:47] body change what job you had.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying now?
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Right now, you may be in a certain
[11:54] position.
[11:56] &gt;&gt; But when Christ chose to rapture you,
[12:00] you are already doing something.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; Whatever you need, it's already done. He
[12:07] says, "What would he do if he was
[12:10] standing here?" I don't know if you
[12:11] would come now to Jesus and say, "Heal
[12:14] me." This is not going to be a repeat of
[12:17] the book of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
[12:19] John.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; If you are thinking you're going to come
[12:23] there and touch the off his garment and
[12:25] say, "Lord, heal me. Heal me." You are
[12:27] nullifying the work on Calvary.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; You can't say, "Hey, that's my place in
[12:32] the Bible. I'm going to crawl on my
[12:33] knees and go touch his garment." Nothing
[12:35] will happen.
[12:37] Praise the Lord.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:43] [crying]
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; I told you this is not practical.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Practical.
[12:51] When he say come here and let me heal
[12:53] you, he couldn't do it.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. [clears throat]
[12:59] &gt;&gt; He could not do it because he's already
[13:01] done it.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, he's already did it. BY HIS
[13:08] STRIPES, you were healed.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; Put up 1 Peter 2:24 there. Amen. By his
[13:14] stripes, you were healed.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Don't you believe that I
[13:18] died for you back then?"
[13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's hear what
[13:23] the Bible is saying now. 1 Peter 2:24.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; Who his own self bear our sins in his
[13:30] own body on the tree.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. that we be dead to sin.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; So devil, don't come and whisper in my
[13:40] ear that I'm a sinner. I am dead to sin.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; That we being dead to sins should live
[13:48] unto righteousness.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; So let me see the righteous ones of God.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Come on now people.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; We've got to confess WHAT WE BELIEVE.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT RIGHTEOUS BASED ON OUR OWN
[14:00] GOOD WORKS. We are righteous because of
[14:02] what Jesus done. And if we are in
[14:04] Christ, we are righteous.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; If we are in Christ, WE ARE HOLY.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; IF WE ARE IN CHRIST, WE ARE PERFECT.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; You say, "What kind of Christianity is
[14:18] this?" There's no part for me to play.
[14:19] The part for us TO DO IS TO BELIEVE that
[14:22] Christ has done it all.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; We should live unto righteousness.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[14:29] &gt;&gt; You know what the defeist mentality is?
[14:32] You know the the the prodical son that
[14:33] came back to the father.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; What was what mentality did he have? He
[14:37] said, "I want to be avant."
[14:40] &gt;&gt; He had servant mentality.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; What did the father promote his thoughts
[14:44] to?
[14:46] &gt;&gt; I'm restoring you back to sunship.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; There is therefore now no condemnation.
[14:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:53] &gt;&gt; To everyone. No.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; To them WHICH ARE IN CHRIST JESUS.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.

[15:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; No condemnation.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Who walk not after THE FLESH BUT AFTER
[15:04] THE SPIRIT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT means
[15:06] &gt;&gt; in legal terms?
[15:09] &gt;&gt; There's a case brought before the father
[15:12] to condemn us.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; And the judgment is
[15:16] &gt;&gt; the case IS CLOSED.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO CONDEMNATION.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [applause and cheering]
[15:21] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. AMEN.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; To them which are in Christ Jesus.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; Case dismissed.
[15:28] Christ already did it. Amen.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; I AM VICTORIOUS IN CHRIST. We need to
[15:34] change our confession. I AM ALREADY
[15:36] VICTORIOUS.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; I HAVE ALREADY WON. Is practical.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Change your mentality.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Change what you what is coming out of
[15:44] your mouth.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; You're moving into practicals.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; That there can't be a sick person laying
[15:49] here.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:56] that even if brother way falls dead this
[15:57] morning, the power is here within us.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; To say, "Brother Way,
[16:02] &gt;&gt; hallelujah."
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 2:24. Let's just go back to
[16:08] that. Amen. I just want to establish a
[16:11] scripture because this is a scripture I
[16:12] prayed in the hospital when those three
[16:15] sisters got discharged.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; Not sisters. My sister was in the
[16:19] hospital and I prayed this prayer and
[16:22] she got discharged with all clear
[16:24] results and that other lady who was
[16:26] there with that cyst that was going to
[16:27] be removed from a organ was going to be
[16:29] removed because of the cyst and the
[16:31] other one that had a blood problem
[16:32] whatever it was all three of them the
[16:35] next morning the doctor said all your
[16:36] results have came back clear you can all
[16:39] leave today
[16:41] [applause]
[16:46] &gt;&gt; this is the scripture who his own self
[16:48] bear our sins in his own body on the
[16:50] tree that we being dead to sins should
[16:52] live unto righteousness by whose stripes
[16:54] he were healed.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; Satan don't want you to know the
[17:01] scripture.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You were healed.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Don't let doctors class you. All my
[17:08] sugar patients stand here.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; All my pressure patient. You are not
[17:12] east patient.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; You're the bloodboard of the Lord Jesus
[17:15] Christ. Amen.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Let all the heart patients stand here.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; They label you.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has labeled you. You are
[17:26] already healed. You are already sons and
[17:28] daughters of God.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; You are my purchased possession.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; The lie of the devil is that you have
[17:33] spots,
[17:34] &gt;&gt; that you have wrinkles. The lie of the
[17:36] devil.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; That you are not perfect.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; That you are still striving for
[17:41] perfection. THAT'S THE LIE OF THE DEVIL.
[17:43] THAT'S RIGHT.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; CHRIST HAS MADE YOU WITHOUT SPOT,
[17:46] WITHOUT WRINKLE, without blemish.
[17:48] [applause]
[17:50] &gt;&gt; NOT TOMORROW. NOW,
[17:53] &gt;&gt; NOW AM I WITHOUT SPOT? NOW AM I WITHOUT
[17:55] BLEMISH? NOW AM I WITHOUT WAS EVE, Adam
[17:58] and Eve already in the image of God.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Were they already created beings that
[18:03] they could speak?
[18:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; Right. So when he was looking at them
[18:09] through the serpent, they were already
[18:10] that. Yes.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; But he made them believe the lie that
[18:13] you still have something to attain.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; So the lie now
[18:20] is that in this AGE AFTER THE SEVEN
[18:22] SEALS ARE OPEN AFTER REVELATION 10:7
[18:25] prophet has come AND GONE THAT THERE'S
[18:27] STILL SOME FURTHER WORK TO BE DONE for
[18:29] this church to rise up TO ITS FULL
[18:31] POTENTIAL. THAT'S A LIE OF THE ENEMY.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[18:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; YES.
[18:38] Which preacher are you waiting for to
[18:39] give you revelation to rise up in faith?
[18:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Which teaching are you not clear about
[18:45] that you need to rise up in faith?
[18:49] &gt;&gt; What we have is people who are not
[18:51] prepared TO STAND UP AND APPLY THE WORD
[18:53] OF GOD.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; TO HAVE RUGGED FAITH.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [clears throat]
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says faith has muscles.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith is belly.
[19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Faith has hair on his chest. Amen.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; So when you're looking at a faith in a
[19:08] believer, you're looking at a hairy
[19:10] chested fra being.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; You are looking AT A STRONG MUSCLED MAN.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; YES.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; So he he says if you can't if Jesus was
[19:24] here physically say heal me, he says he
[19:28] couldn't do it. He'd say don't you
[19:29] believe that I died for you back there?
[19:31] Don't you believe that? That what? That
[19:34] was me who died yonder for your
[19:36] sickness. Don't you think I was wounded
[19:38] for your transgressions? With my
[19:40] stripes, you were healed. Can't you
[19:42] believe my word?
[19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; That's one thing man can't do. Man
[19:47] cannot forgive sins. And man cannot heal
[19:50] sickness. They can't do something that
[19:52] God has already done.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; Man cannot heal sickness. That's
[19:56] something that God has already done. You
[19:58] can't do it. You just have to have faith
[20:00] in the finished work of Christ at
[20:02] Calvary.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; That everything that God can do for you,
[20:09] he's already done it.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Somebody repeat that. Everything
[20:14] &gt;&gt; Everything
[20:15] &gt;&gt; that God
[20:16] &gt;&gt; that God
[20:17] &gt;&gt; can do for you
[20:18] &gt;&gt; can do for you,
[20:19] &gt;&gt; he's already done it.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; He's already done it.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; So, who's bringing you for promotion?
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; What is he saying? Everything that God
[20:26] can do for you,
[20:27] &gt;&gt; oh, please somebody hear me. Amen.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Who is here praying for a marriage
[20:31] partner?
[20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; I know you don't want to raise your hand
[20:33] because everyone going to see you
[20:34] praying for a marriage partner and
[20:35] feeling shy.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Come on now. I want to be practical
[20:38] about what I'm talking about because I
[20:40] want you to see the results.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Everything that God can do for you, he's
[20:46] already done it.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; You say, "What is you that God has
[20:50] already seen you take a rapture?"
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Which means at the point of the rapture,
[20:54] he already saw whether you were married
[20:56] or not. Amen. Amen.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; He already saw whether you're the next
[20:59] dealer principal.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; He already saw whether you're the next
[21:02] manager.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; He already saw. AMEN. IF YOU GOT THAT
[21:05] PROMOTION.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Are you getting what I'm trying to tell
[21:09] you? Maybe. Sorry for my maybe I'm not
[21:11] expressing my thoughts properly, but I'm
[21:13] trying to simplify it as best as I can.
[21:15] He already saw you at the point of the
[21:17] rapture. Every blessing that he would
[21:19] give to you.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; So, he's already done it. Amen.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; At the point OF THE RAPTURE, YOU ALREADY
[21:24] STAY IN YOUR FIVE BEDROOMEDROOM HOUSE.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, please raise the
[21:37] level of your faith this morning.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; He already saw you.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU ALREADY SAW, IT'S ALREADY
[21:50] DONE. YES.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; Then what's our part? Our part is to
[21:53] thank him for already giving it to us.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, if we change our
[21:59] mentality and change our thinking into
[22:01] death, you are going to see what I'm
[22:02] talking about.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So,
[22:11] while you're here seeking out God for
[22:13] your salvation and for your healing,
[22:14] that everything that God can do for you,
[22:17] HE'S ALREADY DONE IT. Every sin is
[22:19] forgiven. Amen.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing this?
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; EVERY SIN IS FORGIVEN.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; Make mistakes.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Confess your sins."
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Confess means to agree with.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It comes from a Greek word.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; You know how English comes from Greek.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; It means to agree with.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; So if you're wrong, you got to agree.
[22:48] Yes, I was wrong. That's right.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; But confession also has a positive part.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; The other part of confession is that
[22:54] when we confess, we saying we agree with
[22:56] God's word and what it says and all the
[22:58] promises attached to God's word. We
[23:00] confess God's word.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Everything. I want you to get that.
[23:04] Everything.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; Some of you sit in your bed AND YOU
[23:08] DREAM ABOUT THINGS PROBABLY SAYING
[23:10] EVERYTHING THAT GOD CAN DO FOR YOU, HE'S
[23:12] ALREADY DONE IT.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; He's already done it. Every sin is
[23:17] forgiven. Every sickness IS HEALED. THE
[23:19] ONLY THING you have to do is look to
[23:20] Calvary and accept what God has already
[23:23] done.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; There it is. It's already finished.
[23:29] Jesus said at Calvary, it is finished.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Then if I was saved, we
[23:38] said we got saved 20 years ago. You
[23:40] know, brother, I got saved 20 years ago.
[23:43] What is he saying? No, I was saved 1900
[23:46] years ago. arrives 2,000 years ago. I
[23:48] just accepted it 20 years ago.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[23:53] &gt;&gt; brother. You know, I was saved 2,000
[23:56] years ago at the cross, but I received
[23:58] it 20 years ago.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; I received it two Amen. 30 years ago.
[24:03] That's the language now. Amen. God Amen.
[24:07] When Christ died, he paid the penalty of
[24:10] both sin and sickness. And sickness is
[24:12] an attribute of sin. And sin is
[24:14] unbelief. Let that just soak for a
[24:16] moment. Amen. If you go to the scripture
[24:17] Psalm 75:6, those of you looking for
[24:19] promotion, promotion is not coming from
[24:21] you pleading with your boss.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; I am telling you, it's already done.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Promotion is not you going and applying
[24:29] and waiting.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; I say whether you are QUALIFIED OR NOT,
[24:36] PROMOTION doesn't come that way.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; Psalm 275 and 6. For promotion cometh
[24:42] neither from the east
[24:44] &gt;&gt; or from THE WEST NOR FROM THE SOUTH,
[24:47] but God is the judge. HE PUT IT DOWN ONE
[24:50] and he set it up another.
[24:52] [applause and cheering]
[24:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Uh let's just go
[24:57] to this quickly. He says the greatest
[24:58] problem now I I am defining.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; Remember the problem is preaching to a
[25:03] later day and age.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; I don't expect this condition to exist
[25:06] in heavenly places.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't expect in this time AND
[25:10] SEASON WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO READ TO
[25:12] EXIST IN A WORLD OF PERFECT FAITH.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; The problem with the Pentecostal church
[25:19] today is positionally they don't know
[25:21] who what they are.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; You're sons and daughters of God.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; And a whole lot of times you're LOOKING
[25:26] FOR SOMETHING GREAT TO COME, BUT YOU
[25:29] ALREADY GOT THAT.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; I say Malachi 4 HAS ALREADY COME AND OUR
[25:33] HEART HAS ALREADY BEEN TURNED
[25:34] [applause and cheering] BACK to the
[25:35] faith that was once delivered to the
[25:37] saints. Amen.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for something to come
[25:42] great to come. WE ALREADY GOT THAT THE
[25:44] GREATEST CAN BE GIVEN YOU. NOW, WE ARE
[25:47] SONS of God. Not will be, but we are
[25:49] now. And we are seated together in
[25:50] HEAVENLY PLACES IN CHRIST Jesus right
[25:53] now. When faith like that gets into the
[25:55] church, the devil moves away from the
[25:57] place.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; So, I AM TELLING YOU THIS MORNING THAT
[26:01] UNEMPLOYMENT IS ILLEGAL.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; YES. YES.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[26:08] Thank you, LORD.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ACCORDING TO GOD'S WORD FOR
[26:10] SOMEBODY TO BE UNEMPLOYED. HEAR ME WHAT
[26:12] I'M SAYING. DON'T GET OFFENDED, BUT I
[26:14] TAKE GOD'S WORD THIS MORNING.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; And say, LORD, I WANT TO APPLY MY WORDS
[26:18] RIGHT NOW AND ALIGN IT WITH YOUR
[26:20] PROMISE.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; Sickness is illegal.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; DEPRESSION IS ILLEGAL.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; YES.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; It's an illegal ACT THAT SATAN PUTS UPON
[26:31] US. BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT
[26:33] CHRIST HAS ALREADY DONE FOR THEM, THEN
[26:35] SATAN comes to try to take advantage.
[26:37] It's like a squatter.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Just trying to live in this house.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; But not this morning.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; The red answer here [applause] this
[26:45] morning.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; How many of you know what the red ants
[26:47] are?
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a legal demolish.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; It's there established by the
[26:53] government.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; They come and demolish every illegal
[26:56] squatter camp. I say Satan this morning,
[26:59] we're giving you notice. Amen. Satan has
[27:01] been oppressing your mind. Satan has
[27:03] been holding you bound. Amen. But this
[27:04] morning, the red answer here this
[27:06] morning. Amen. To let go of God's
[27:08] people. AMEN. TO REPOSSESS EVERY
[27:11] RIGHTFUL claim of God. [applause]
[27:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Unemployment is illegal. You say, "Why
[27:21] is it illegal?"
[27:23] &gt;&gt; God, if you go, you now remember I'm
[27:25] giving you keys. You need to apply keys.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith is applied by
[27:29] principles.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; If if there's a principle, A LAW ON THE
[27:32] EARTH, say the law of gravity, that
[27:34] whatever you throw up must come down.
[27:36] That's a principle.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Meaning if that somebody throws it up
[27:39] here in South Africa, it will come down.
[27:41] If somebody throws it up there in the
[27:42] USA, it will come down. If somebody
[27:44] throws it up there in in England, it
[27:46] will come down because it's a principle,
[27:48] A LAW ESTABLISHED ON THE EARTH.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Another kingdom principle is whatsoever
[27:54] you sow, that shall you reap.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a kingdom principle. The
[27:58] reason that you are receiving back lack
[28:00] and Amen. and and all of these bad
[28:02] NEGATIVE THINGS YOU HAVEN'T SOWN.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible says it is better to give
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; than to receive.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAVE YOU SEOWN in the season of
[28:17] sewing?
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Remember, if you put nothing IN THE
[28:20] GROUND, YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO RECEIVE AN
[28:23] AMEN.
[28:28] EVEN THE SCRIPTURE LUKE 6:38, WHAT DOES
[28:30] IT SAY THERE?
[28:33] &gt;&gt; GIVE.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; YES.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; LORD, I'm just expecting you to bless
[28:37] me. Let's go to the scripture, brother.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; What it starts with?
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Give.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Receive.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; In order for you to receive, what you
[28:50] must do first?
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Give.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; Give. and it shall be given unto you.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Good measure, pressed down, shaken
[29:02] together, and running over.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying there are seasons in your
[29:09] life where you have to sow. Put Matthew
[29:11] 7:7 there, brother.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; There are seasons you have to sow before
[29:15] you can ask.
[29:18] Ask and it shall be given you.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:22] seek. I'm seeking for a wife. I'm
[29:25] seeking for a job. I'm seeking for this.
[29:28] And you shall find.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Seek and you shall find. Which
[29:34] means you need to go on every job
[29:36] website and seek.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; And then you need to knock. You need to
[29:40] apply.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; You need to apply for the job.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; We need to apply the word that you're
[29:52] already healed and it shall be opened
[29:54] unto [clears throat] you.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; So what is the Bible saying here?
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Ask
[29:59] &gt;&gt; at the end part
[30:01] &gt;&gt; that no door shall be closed to you.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; What I'm getting at the end part of this
[30:09] is there is no door
[30:11] &gt;&gt; that will be closed to you.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; No door shall be closed to you.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; So you say, WHERE'S THE SCRIPTURE? GOD
[30:32] PUT MAN in the garden to work.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; So according to God's principle, man
[30:36] must work.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; He said there was no man to till the
[30:41] soil. So God created a garden eastward
[30:43] of Eden and he put man there before he
[30:45] gave him a wife. He said work.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's move on.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; So when you're going to God in faith,
[30:55] now this is doesn't just apply for the
[30:57] unemployed. It's for those also that
[30:59] have a job, but maybe they need better
[31:01] finances to better take care of their
[31:02] family.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; I thank you, Lord, that you have already
[31:05] given me this according to your word.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; It's illegal for men not to work. So I
[31:10] thank you for for employment.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Is somebody hearing what I'm saying?
[31:14] Amen.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; And I pray that if you're not writing
[31:16] this down, that you're making a mental
[31:19] note of what I am saying.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; I thank you, Lord, that I've already
[31:22] received that which you have told me I
[31:23] must do.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; For me not to work or for me to be in
[31:27] lack or for my family to struggle, Amen.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; is illegal.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going to prove to you now for you to
[31:35] be in poverty is illegal.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; So we start to say according to your
[31:40] word, unemployment is illegal. So I
[31:42] thank you for employment. According to
[31:44] your word, sickness is illegal. So I
[31:46] thank you for healing
[31:47] &gt;&gt; according to your word. Amen. All of
[31:49] these diseases are illegal. Amen. So our
[31:53] part is to apply every position of the
[31:55] word without considering. So hear what
[31:57] I'm saying? Don't consider the position
[31:59] you're applying for.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:04] Do not consider whether you're qualified
[32:06] for the position you're applying for or
[32:08] not.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's one testifying. I can also
[32:13] testify for that.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Do not consider the position you're
[32:17] applying for whether you're qualified
[32:19] according to the worldly systems.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Now, there are certain positions you
[32:25] can't go and practice, right? I'm not
[32:26] saying you must say I'm a doctor now and
[32:28] start treating patients. No,
[32:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying you must go and practice
[32:32] law now and all of this.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; No, I'm saying the position you are
[32:37] going to apply for don't consider
[32:39] whether you're qualified or not.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; So according to the worldly
[32:46] qualifications, Joseph was not qualified
[32:48] to run Portifer's house, let alone
[32:50] Egypt.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; This boy was pampered by his father.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; He never worked a day in his life.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; The other brothers were working.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; They were taking care of the sheep. BUT
[33:02] JOSEPH WAS PAMPERED BY HIS FATHER.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; He never earned or worked for the coat
[33:08] of many colors.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; This was daddy's boy. daddy's favorite.
[33:14] Hallelujah. He was not qualified to rule
[33:18] part of his house. He did not qualify to
[33:20] be the head of prisoners. He did not
[33:21] qualify to RULE EGYPT. BUT GOD QUALIFIED
[33:25] HIM.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; God qualified him to run Egypt.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Who son are you?
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; I am a son of God.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; I am healed.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am changes everything.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; You need to KNOW THAT THE GREAT I AM.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; He's a part of you now.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; I don't know how we're doing for time,
[33:54] but we need to move on. Amen. So, like
[33:56] we are saying, unemployment is an
[33:58] illegal act.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Sickness is an illegal act that Satan
[34:01] puts on you because of the fall.
[34:02] Sickness is illegal. Unemployment is
[34:04] illegal. Disease is illegal. Poverty is
[34:07] illegal. Genesis 22:16.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Let's see what God told Abraham.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; And said, "By myself."
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Do you know a man's word is good
[34:21] &gt;&gt; as himself?
[34:22] &gt;&gt; But this is no ordinary man swearing.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; This is the one who created all things.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; He says, "By myself have I sworn,
[34:31] &gt;&gt; sayeth the Lord, for because thou has
[34:33] done this thing and has not thy son and
[34:36] only son." Yeah.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; That in blessing I will bless
[34:43] &gt;&gt; by myself.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; I'm swearing a covenant with you
[34:46] Abraham.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Now remember Abraham chose to sacrifice
[34:51] his son and the Lord created a ram.
[34:53] Right.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; You have chosen to accept God's word in
[34:56] this hour.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; God is a sworn affidavit that he will
[35:00] bless you. You say show me in the
[35:01] scripture. He's saying, Abraham, I have
[35:04] sworn by myself that in blessing, I will
[35:06] bless thee.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; In multiplying, I will multiply thee,
[35:11] thy seed, as the stars of the heaven,
[35:14] and the sand which is upon the seashore,
[35:16] and thy seed of the earth be blessed
[35:18] because thou has obeyed my voice. But
[35:20] you are God's chosen people.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Some of you believing that here I am.
[35:25] Here I am as the wife of the Lord Jesus
[35:27] Christ, and here's Israel, but God loves
[35:28] Israel more. You are sorely mistaken.
[35:30] That's a lie from the devil.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Between you and Israel, God loves you
[35:39] more.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; You accepted him.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; You accepted his sacrifice right until
[35:43] now. They reject Jesus.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; SO IF THE JEWS, WHAT I'M SHOWING YOU,
[35:48] &gt;&gt; IF THEY ACCORDING TO A NATURAL covenant
[35:50] can be blessed.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; What about you?
[35:53] &gt;&gt; I say they are not blessed better than
[35:55] you. You are just living beneath your
[35:56] god-given [applause] privileges.
[35:57] [cheering]
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:01] Amen.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; In thy seed shall all the nations of the
[36:03] earth be blessed because thou has obeyed
[36:06] my voice. Now notice what that scripture
[36:08] said. Not only you, Abraham, but your
[36:10] seed after you.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Then let's get to Galatians 3 and 29 and
[36:14] see if we are in there.
[36:17] And if you be in Christ, all this time
[36:19] we've been reading, we're in Christ in
[36:21] heavenly places. If you be in Christ,
[36:25] then you are Abraham's
[36:27] &gt;&gt; seed.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. and is according to the promise.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; So if he promised to bless Abraham,
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; then he's promised to bless me.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Abraham's [applause] blessings are mine.
[36:39] [singing]
[36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Abraham's blessings are mine.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Abraham's blessings are mine.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Abraham's blessings are mine. I told you
[36:49] poverty is illegal.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; You need to tell Satan that.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; You need to CONFESS IT WITH YOUR MOUTH.
[36:56] Poverty is illegal. I am in Christ and I
[37:00] share THE SAME REWARD AS ABRAHAM.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; And if you PROMISE TO BLESS ABRAHAM, I
[37:05] AM PART OF THAT BLESSING AND I'm
[37:06] claiming it.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody hear ME WHAT I'M
[37:09] SAYING. POVERTY is illegal.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Somebody write that down. Galatians
[37:18] 3:29.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; And Genesis 22:16,
[37:22] 20, and 17. If God promised to bless
[37:25] Abraham and his seed here in Galatians
[37:27] 23:29, he's saying because I'm in
[37:29] Christ, you are Abraham's seed.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to go to God and put a
[37:36] claim.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Put a claim on God.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; I refuse to accept that Israel, natural
[37:42] Israel is a blessed far above me.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Hey.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; I refuse to accept that they are blessed
[37:48] far above me.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; I am Abraham seed.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. There's no way you can bless HIM
[37:53] ABOVE ME. I ACCEPTED YOUR SACRIFICE ON
[37:55] THE CROSS. I ACCEPTED GOD'S PROVIDED
[37:57] WAY. [applause and cheering]
[37:58] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; You see what he's saying? Satan hasn't
[38:03] got any legal rights at all over a
[38:06] Christian.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Satan has not got any legal rights at
[38:09] all.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; I told you unemployment, sickness,
[38:12] disease, and all of these things are
[38:14] illegal acts.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every time a man gets saved,
[38:17] God just writes a whole big bunch of
[38:19] checks and puts your name at the bottom.
[38:22] Are you hear me? God has already written
[38:24] checks out.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Put your name at the bottom and said,
[38:27] "There you are. Fill them out. Are you
[38:29] scared of it?
[38:31] Fill it out."
[38:32] &gt;&gt; I told you this is practical this
[38:34] morning. What are you desiring? What do
[38:36] you want from the Lord?
[38:37] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you a question.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; If you don't want to listen to me,
[38:40] neighbor, ask them. Ask him, "What do
[38:42] you want from the Lord?" Come on,
[38:43] brother Kale.
[38:45] Amen.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; He says, "Are you scared? FILL IT OUT.
[38:49] WHATEVER things you desire when you
[38:50] pray, believe you receive it. It'll be
[38:52] given to you." And the prophet is
[38:53] quoting Mark 11:23.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; He says, "Every word of God is a seed
[38:57] that'll bring forth."
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Now, how many of you know where the word
[39:01] of God is coming out of? It's coming out
[39:03] of your mouth.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; In this time and season, the word of God
[39:06] is in you.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; You are the word made flesh. So, every
[39:10] time you speak, it should be the WORD OF
[39:11] GOD. SHOULD BE THE WORD OF GOD. THE WORD
[39:13] OF GOD IS NINE even in thy mouth.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Joshua, I will be with you. Amen. BE
[39:18] THOU STRONG. BE THOU COURAGEOUS. AMEN.
[39:20] But only keep my word in your mouth.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[39:26] the Lord.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Every word of God is a seed
[39:32] that'll bring forth. It'll bring forth
[39:34] what it's purpose for. I see many of you
[39:36] down here raising cotton, apples,
[39:38] peaches, fruits. Here's here's another
[39:40] point now to illustrate. Pay attention
[39:42] to this. When that little apple tree is
[39:44] no bigger than say than right here,
[39:46] every apple that will ever be in that
[39:48] tree is right in them.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Every apple that will be produced, it's
[39:51] in the seed.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; I say every job. That's why I told you
[39:54] at the rapture God knew you what how
[39:56] you'll be raptured. Every promotion,
[39:58] every healing, every deliverance, Amen.
[40:00] is already sent out to you.
[40:02] [music and singing]
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; You already have it.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; I SAY GO OUT AND POSSESS IT.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; GO OUT AND POSSESS IT NOW. EVEN NOW,
[40:10] RECEIVE YOUR HEALING. EVEN NOW RECEIVE
[40:12] WHAT YOU HAVE ASKED FOR RIGHT NOW. AMEN.
[40:15] HALLELUJAH.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. When God WHEN GOD DROPPED
[40:19] DOWN IN THE ROOM THERE WITH HE RIGHT,
[40:21] the prophet says look at Edith,
[40:24] &gt;&gt; right? Look at Edith. She's been sick in
[40:26] the wheelchair. You can ask for her to
[40:28] be healed.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; He says you're poor. Yeah. Here's the
[40:31] thing that poverty is illegal. The
[40:33] prophet told right you need money even a
[40:36] million rand will be given to you now.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; She didn't say oh you're not meant to be
[40:40] poor. The prophet didn't say, "Yeah,
[40:41] you're meant to be poor, sister." He
[40:43] said, "Even if you wanted a million rand
[40:45] right now."
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; It'll be given you.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Come on. Am I talking to message
[40:51] believers?
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; All of the options available to her
[40:57] &gt;&gt; was not she what she was desiring.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying even the options I'm
[41:03] offering you this morning, maybe it's
[41:05] something I haven't touched on, but you
[41:06] are praying and seeking the Lord for
[41:08] this morning. You speak according to the
[41:10] revelation of your faith.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Auntie Wright said, "I desire, BROTHER
[41:14] BRANDON, YOU ARE telling me about ET.
[41:16] You are telling me about money. YOU ARE
[41:17] TELLING I DESIRE
[41:19] &gt;&gt; THE SALVATION OF MY two boys."
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Everything is in that seed. Well, you
[41:31] say, "Well, where did it come from?" If
[41:33] they're not there, they're in the tree.
[41:35] Not only that the little tree you stick
[41:37] it in the ground, plant it, it has to
[41:38] grow. It has to draw moisture from the
[41:41] ground. Has to draw more than its a
[41:42] loted portion. You have to give it
[41:45] plenty water. Right? The apples was on
[41:48] the inside at the beginning. He just has
[41:50] to drink. And every man that's born
[41:52] again in Christ, everything you have
[41:54] need of
[41:55] &gt;&gt; and here again now, please. Everything
[41:57] you have need of.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:07] I have need of a house. I have need of a
[42:09] car. I have need of finances. I have
[42:12] need of this, that, and the other.
[42:14] Everything you have need of.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Satan will afflict you. Sure he will.
[42:23] But everything you have need of in your
[42:25] whole life's journey. You see, I'm not
[42:28] making this up.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; The prophet is telling you, I'm just
[42:31] saying it in a different way sometimes.
[42:34] in your
[42:36] &gt;&gt; whole life's journey.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything you have need of in
[42:48] your whole life's journey is in you
[42:50] right then.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; So let's rephrase that.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Your job is in you.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Your healing is in you.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Your car, your house, whatever you need
[43:01] is in you. Amen.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; The reason you don't have it is because
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Is that what the property is saying?
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of in your
[43:14] whole life's journey is in you right
[43:16] then.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But then they tell you, your wife
[43:21] is in you.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; What's in you, you need to speak it.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Tyson, you catching this?
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Where is it?
[43:36] &gt;&gt; In you.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; It's in you.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; You need to bring what's in you to
[43:42] material.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; When I'm saying it's in you, it's in
[43:46] your thoughts.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; God had thoughts of a world
[43:49] &gt;&gt; with light that was full of form
[43:51] &gt;&gt; that was not void.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; But as long as it remained thoughts,
[43:56] nothing happened.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; God had to speak.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, wonderful. And the prophet says
[44:01] you have to believe his word.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; So everything you have need of is in
[44:05] you.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; You know Brew nothing good ever happens
[44:08] to me. That's the only thing you're
[44:09] telling.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; You know in our family
[44:14] &gt;&gt; it's always you see who's saying that?
[44:16] You saying it.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of for your
[44:20] whole life's journey is in you.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; You know why I'm telling you that you're
[44:25] a creator.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You were created in
[44:29] the image of God and God is a creator.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; So when God was when God created man, he
[44:34] was looking at an amateur God.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; You can't tell me that you don't believe
[44:40] you're a creator, but you go around and
[44:42] tell everyone random created squirrels
[44:44] &gt;&gt; and you're a hypocrite.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Man is a creator.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; The prophet even says, "Amen. He can
[44:53] even create our own new world." Come on.
[44:55] Am I preaching the message or not? Amen.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of for this
[45:01] whole life's journey is in you right
[45:03] then. And we are planted in Christ. You
[45:05] see what I mean? When a born again and
[45:07] baptism of the Holy Spirit has come into
[45:09] your heart, you have everything that you
[45:11] have need for the journey. Now, the only
[45:13] thing you have to do, here's the key.
[45:15] Here's start drinking, drinking, pushing
[45:18] out, drinking, pushing out. I believe
[45:21] here's my analysis of Christ Jesus. He
[45:23] is inexhaustible fountain of life. and
[45:26] every man that's planted in him can
[45:28] drink, drink, and push out and push out
[45:31] every redemptive blessing that God has
[45:33] promised belongs to you. And it's YOUR
[45:36] PERSONAL PROPERTY.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; And the devil has got any tie to it at
[45:44] all. He hasn't got any legal rights. His
[45:47] legal rights WERE SPOILED AT CALVARY.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Here's a testimony. Sam wanted this
[45:54] building. Yeah.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Listen what I'm telling you. You may be
[45:59] renting now, but while you're renting,
[46:01] if you love that house, thank God that
[46:02] he already bought that house. He has
[46:04] already given it to you.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Right. So Sam wanted this building.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; And he told the prophet, you know, it's
[46:10] tied up in legal things and I can't get
[46:12] it this, that, and the other. The
[46:14] prophet went and prayed.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; The prophet went and prayed.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:24] And he says, "Brother Sam called him. I
[46:26] don't know if it was the next day, but
[46:27] he called him up and he told him,
[46:29] "Brother Brandham, I don't know what
[46:30] happened."
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Suddenly, everything worked out
[46:33] &gt;&gt; and I'm now the owner of this building.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; So, I tell you what you do.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; You ready?
[46:43] &gt;&gt; How many of you are ready?
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; It is cheaper to rent a car than to buy
[46:48] a car
[46:49] &gt;&gt; because you can rent a car even for one
[46:50] day. You hearing what I'm saying? You
[46:53] hearing what I'm saying? You can rent a
[46:55] car for one day.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; You can even get somebody to help you
[47:00] rent that car,
[47:01] &gt;&gt; but it's harder to go buy a car. Right,
[47:02] brother?
[47:04] So, hear what I'm saying. If you got
[47:06] faith enough to believe, go rent the car
[47:08] you want
[47:10] &gt;&gt; even for one day. You don't have a
[47:12] credit card, go to somebody who got a
[47:14] credit card, say, "Here's the money.
[47:16] Please rent this car for one day and
[47:17] drive in that car."
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:20] And thank the Lord for already giving
[47:21] you that car.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Hey, who's hearing me?
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; You're not hearing me.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Jevil, what you need to start
[47:29] doing, you know, they have open hour
[47:30] shows.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; You need to start going for this open
[47:34] hour shows.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; They don't know.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; You just make an appointment.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; And don't go look here in You go look
[47:46] where you want.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[47:49] That's right.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; You want to stay in the state, go stay
[47:51] in the state.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; It's not clear estate now.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Sorry, sister. [laughter] She's from
[48:00] clear state. Amen.
[48:03] [cough]
[48:05] &gt;&gt; How many of you hearing what I'm saying?
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; It's cheaper for you to rent a car. You
[48:09] want a Mercedes, a BMW, go rent it. Go
[48:12] drive in it and say, "Lord, hey, this
[48:14] thing feels nice." If you don't know
[48:15] what I'm talking about, ask brother
[48:16] Willie to give you a lift.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[48:19] &gt;&gt; It's nice German engineering.
[48:22] You drive that thing, you feel good,
[48:25] too.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Now, you can't lie to me that when
[48:28] you're driving these nice cars, you
[48:29] don't feel good.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; You feel good.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; These things make you feel good.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; But you've got to have plenty of faith,
[48:38] right?
[48:39] &gt;&gt; So, I'm telling you, if Shamadia could
[48:40] ask the prophet and the next day or
[48:43] whatever week it took and the building
[48:45] was released to him.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. How about you?
[48:50] &gt;&gt; You all heard the testimony of brother
[48:52] Joshua.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; It was one service I said it's 11:23
[48:57] now. Ask what you want.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; He testified.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Then there was another service. I said
[49:02] some of you, you don't have to buy your
[49:03] house by mortgage. You can buy it cash.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; But it's only people that are receiving
[49:08] it by faith.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Then you know they were able to buy
[49:11] their property that way.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How? Amen.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Not on human efforts.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; But God supernaturally supply.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Because we can't be quoting my God shall
[49:21] supply all my needs. You're saying all
[49:23] your needs.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; But you still have many needs.
[49:28] [clears throat]
[49:28] &gt;&gt; So when is he going to supply in the
[49:30] rapture?
[49:31] &gt;&gt; It must happen now.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse paragraph 23 of the
[49:41] next one there. It says, "I found two
[49:42] classes of people listed in my third
[49:45] time around the world. Find two classes
[49:47] of people. One of them is fundamentals.
[49:49] The other one is Pentecostal.
[49:50] Fundamentals know their their place.
[49:52] They haven't got much faith. The
[49:54] Pentecostals have plenty of faith but
[49:56] don't know who they are. It's just like
[49:58] a man that's got money in the bank and
[50:00] don't know how to write a check. And the
[50:01] next man can write a check and don't
[50:03] have money in the bank. If you ever can
[50:05] get them two together, and that's where
[50:07] we should be now
[50:08] &gt;&gt; in heavenly places, we should be that
[50:10] two that's together.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; If they only realize who you are, you're
[50:16] sons and daughters of God, heirs of the
[50:18] kingdom. Right now, we are kings. Claim
[50:20] your legal rights. Don't let Satan press
[50:22] anything on you. You're of God. He has
[50:24] no rights to hold it. He says every
[50:27] everyone's always looking at their
[50:28] symptoms. The pastor will pray for them.
[50:30] They go over and say, "Well, I don't
[50:32] seem to be any better." That that's not
[50:33] healing.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Symptoms is the worst thing. That's one
[50:36] of the greatest scarecrow the devil's
[50:37] got. Symptoms don't have nothing to do
[50:39] with it.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Stop telling me you're sick and you're
[50:42] this and you're that. You're telling me
[50:43] your symptoms.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm just quoting the prophet here.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; You want to get angry with me, get angry
[50:51] with the prophet. I still want to be
[50:52] your brother.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Symptoms don't have nothing to do with
[50:56] it. Is because God said so. If there's
[50:59] anybody ever had a case of symptoms, it
[51:01] was Jonah. Right? So we know Jonah had
[51:04] symptoms. Amen. But what he began to do,
[51:07] he started to look and remember what uh
[51:12] what King Solomon said, "If I ever look
[51:13] to your temple."
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "If I ever look to your
[51:17] temple," right? So let's just get past
[51:19] there. So next one there. He says, "If
[51:21] you're looking,"
[51:23] Next slide there. Just go out down. Talk
[51:25] about symptoms. He was in the whale's
[51:27] belly. Everywhere he looked was whale's
[51:28] belly. Let's move on from there.
[51:31] Amen.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Move on. He says depends. If you're
[51:35] looking at your symptoms, they'll be
[51:37] there.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; If you're looking for symptoms, they'll
[51:41] be there.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; If you look to God's word, symptoms will
[51:47] have to vanish.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Why did Jonah do that? It's because he
[51:52] knows when Solomon dedicated the temple,
[51:54] he said, "Lord, if their children be in
[51:56] any place and will look towards the holy
[51:58] place to pray, you'll hear from heaven."
[52:00] Amen.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; And if Jonah under those circumstances
[52:05] could believe that God heard Solomon's
[52:07] prayer, how much more ought we when we
[52:09] look once more to thy holy temple where
[52:12] Jesus sits at the right hand of the
[52:13] majesty in heaven, his own body as a
[52:15] sacrifice. Amen. God kept him alive for
[52:18] three days and nights and delivered him
[52:20] to Nineveh. Amen. Hallelujah. He says,
[52:24] "Miss John Doe, I have something here
[52:27] now." He says, "Miss John Doe, I have
[52:28] something here for you." And you say,
[52:30] "What is that?" You look, it's a big
[52:31] box.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; You got a delivery. It's not from Take a
[52:34] Lot. It's from Satan's lot.
[52:39] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[52:44] He got a big box, big box of
[52:46] rattlesnakes. You say, "I don't want
[52:48] those things." But they're telling YOU
[52:49] IT'S YOUR NAME ON IT.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; They go to THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE. YOUR
[52:56] NAME, YOUR TEST RESULT. This is Come on
[52:59] now, BROTHER. IT'S YOUR TEST RESULT.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Accept this test result.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; What you going to do?
[53:10] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S YOUR TEST RESULT. WHAT YOU
[53:11] GOING TO DO?
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Reject it.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; The test results have come back
[53:17] positive, but you refuse to accept it.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; It says it's yours. They're yours.
[53:23] Somebody sent them to you. Why? You say,
[53:25] "I don't want them."
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Now, Miss John Doe, here's your name.
[53:28] Somebody sent them to you, they're
[53:29] yours. He will do everything he can make
[53:32] you to take them.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; He'll do everything to make you believe
[53:35] you're still a sinner.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; That you still need to achieve holiness.
[53:38] That you still need to achieve
[53:39] righteousness. That you still need to
[53:41] achieve perfection.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; He's lying to you.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Don't sign for nothing the devil bought.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Brought. Refuse to have it. Don't have
[53:50] it. No, sir. The devil put that
[53:52] affliction. The devil put the disease
[53:54] there. Just refuse to see it. No, I
[53:56] won't sign for it. I won't testify for
[53:58] nothing.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[54:00] &gt;&gt; I will testify by his stripes I am
[54:01] healed because he will take it back. Oh,
[54:04] you say yeah but you know snakes are in
[54:06] there too. Your personal name pend on
[54:08] it. You might have marched you for death
[54:10] with cancer with anything else but

[54:14] I am healed. And testify means to say
[54:16] the same thing.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; So what is our testimony supposed to be?
[54:20] Our testimony is supposed to say say the
[54:22] same thing as God. By his stripes I am
[54:24] healed.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; By his stripes I am healed. If you're
[54:27] sleeping, I'm going to make you all
[54:28] stand now. Amen. As I continue. Praise
[54:30] the Lord.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Let's get to the next quote there. Amen.
[54:39] After that, he says, "Don't be scared.
[54:42] Don't be scared to ask.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Don't be scared to ask. Ask abundantly.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; You have not because you ask not.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; You ask not because you believe not. ASK
[54:53] A WHOLE LOT." I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
[54:55] BIBLE EXAMPLES NOW. ASK A WHOLE LOT.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL GIVE YOU a whole lot.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Who is receiving this word?
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Hey, because I'm coming for
[55:04] Thanksgiving.

[55:12] center? Food.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Long since we ordered from there.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Last we had was April.
[55:26] He says, "Ask a whole lot. GOD WILL GIVE
[55:28] YOU A WHOLE LOT."
[55:30] &gt;&gt; YEAH. I don't hear you.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Have [snorts] a whole lot of faith. A
[55:36] fellow told me years now. You You think
[55:38] I was joking when I said this? A fellow
[55:41] was driving riding an old model T4.
[55:47] He said one day he happened to get some
[55:49] good faith. How many of you are getting
[55:50] good faith this morning? Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; One day he happened to get some good
[55:54] faith and God gave him a Buick.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "I GOT A BUICK FAITH. I PRAYING
[56:02] FOR CADILLAC FAITH."

[56:12] &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOU STARTED TO BELIEVE FOR
[56:13] TOYOTA FAITH.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; But I'm saying there's A WHOLE LOT MORE
[56:16] FAITH THAN THAT.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE ASKING GOD ACCORDING TO YOUR
[56:19] LIMITATION. ACCORDING TO WHAT? WHO SAID
[56:21] YOU CAN'T OWN A BRAND NEW CAR?
[56:23] &gt;&gt; WHO SAID YOU MUST MOVE around with a
[56:24] scor?
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; You know who said that? You said that.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; You put the limitation on yourself, not
[56:33] God.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Read this thing again. Some
[56:37] of you want the sport. Amen. We'll send
[56:39] it to you. Amen. Praise the Lord. He's
[56:42] riding a old T- model. One day he got
[56:45] happened to get some good faith. God
[56:46] gave him a Buick. I got Buick faith. I'm

[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; So if you want to move in your old model
[56:54] T4, don't be a sulking, grumpy person.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Because you didn't have faith. Now
[57:01] you're jealous of everyone else and
[57:02] you're picking on them.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; How about you raise a level of your
[57:06] faith and get yourself out of that
[57:07] situation.

[58:10] &gt;&gt; He's got fourth faith. So just stay with
[58:12] the fourth there.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; That's all right. Let's get a little
[58:16] more faith.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, ask God for things
[58:21] impossible. You say, "Show me
[58:22] scripture." Ask God for things
[58:24] impossible.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Ask God that it's so impossible. God
[58:31] will marvel at your faith.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Here's a scripture. 2 Kings 2:9. Elijah
[58:36] asked Elisha, "Ask what I can do for you
[58:38] before I'm taken from you." And Elisha
[58:41] asked him something he never thought he
[58:42] would ask. He says, "I am asking, I pray
[58:45] thee, let a double portion of thy spirit
[58:47] be upon me." And there he says, "Thou
[58:49] has asked a half thing."
[58:53] Ask God things you think are impossible.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; He says, "Nevertheless,
[58:59] Amen. If thou see me when I am taken
[59:02] from thee, it shall be so unto thee, but
[59:04] if not, it shall not be so." So, it was
[59:07] based on his condition of keeping the
[59:09] word. Right? There again, Matthew 20.
[59:13] And he said unto her, he's asking this
[59:15] woman now, the Lord Jesus, what wilt
[59:17] thou? She said unto him, Grant that my
[59:20] two sons sit, one on the right hand, and
[59:23] the other on their left in thy kingdom.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Hear what Jesus says? Jesus answered,
[59:27] you know not what you ask. Are you able
[59:30] to drink of the same cup that I drink
[59:32] and baptize with the baptism that I am
[59:34] baptized with? And they say, we are
[59:36] able. And he said, "You shall indeed
[59:38] drink of my cup and be baptized." You
[59:42] know what Jesus, let me summarize this
[59:43] whole thing.
[59:46] James and John mother came to ask Jesus
[59:49] &gt;&gt; asking a hard thing.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Wants to sit on the throne.
[59:55] Jesus is saying THE THRONE IS ONLY
[59:57] RESERVED FOR THE ONE THAT DIES, rises
[1:00:00] again, and overcomes.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is where I'm going to
[1:00:06] throw in now that the boxer
[1:00:10] goes to fight the battle
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; but the wife reaps the reward.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; So he is an OVERCOMER BUT SHE'S MORE
[1:00:18] THAN AN OVERCOMER.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; SO CHRIST DIED, rose again, seated at
[1:00:22] the right [applause] hand of the father,
[1:00:23] but [cheering] me as his wife, I am more
[1:00:25] than a conqueror.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering]
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; It was James and John. Somebody tell me
[1:00:33] the sons of thunder. Yeah.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; So ask out things. Praise the Lord. So
[1:00:42] the greatest power is atomic power.
[1:00:45] Amen.
[1:00:47] The greatest power in the world is not
[1:00:49] the atomic bomb, but a believer in
[1:00:52] contact with his maker.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; God will do it. He's obligated to do it.
[1:00:57] If you abide in me, my words abide in
[1:01:00] you, then you have God, the word of God,
[1:01:02] and you believe
[1:01:04] the word. Just as you believe God, it is
[1:01:06] God. It's inseparable. Then if you don't
[1:01:09] have God's word in you, if you have
[1:01:11] God's word in you, you have God's life
[1:01:12] in you. You have God in you. And
[1:01:14] whatever God's word speaks forth out of
[1:01:16] you, it'll come to pass just like it was
[1:01:19] spoke from God.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. I don't sleep on this.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Whatever desires you have, the word of
[1:01:26] God is in you.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; It's coming out of your mouth. He's
[1:01:29] saying whatever God speaks through your
[1:01:30] mouth, he says whatever God's word
[1:01:33] speaks forth out of you, it'll come to
[1:01:35] pass just like it was spoke from God.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus said whatever you ask the father
[1:01:41] in my name. Do you realize what that
[1:01:43] means? You realize if we go before God
[1:01:45] in the name of Jesus, it's just the same
[1:01:47] as Jesus himself praying.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, Lord.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; You see why I'm saying we need to
[1:01:53] approach not come with the servant
[1:01:55] mentality. The scripture says, I don't
[1:01:57] have time. Hebrews says, "Come before
[1:02:00] the throne room boldly."
[1:02:02] You need to come there, Lord. I thank
[1:02:03] you of your son. I thank you, Lord, that
[1:02:05] you paid the price and I'm redeemed.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; I'm the bloodboard of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:10] Christ. I'm a son
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; and I thank you that you have given me
[1:02:13] legal right to ask.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Change the way we approach the throne of
[1:02:16] God.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; You say, "Can I do it?" Hear what the
[1:02:20] prophet is saying. Are we the sons of
[1:02:22] God? waiting for the manifestation of
[1:02:24] the sons of God. When God will make
[1:02:26] himself known, they'll stop sickness.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; They'll stop cancer.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; They'll stop diseases.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Who you?
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; I want you to stop it.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; I want you to stop cancer.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; I want you to stop sickness. I want you
[1:02:42] to stop disease. How you going to do it?
[1:02:43] Jesus paid it all.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Let's get the musicians.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus paid it all.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. You ought to have warrior faith
[1:02:51] right now. Amen.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; We ought to storm the gates of the enemy
[1:02:54] right now. I'm telling you, you lying
[1:02:56] demon. You lied to me all these years.
[1:02:59] Amen. You lied to me. Amen. And I've
[1:03:01] been living under my God-given
[1:03:02] privileges, but right now I'm coming
[1:03:04] against the gates of hell.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Some of you couldn't receive what I was
[1:03:10] saying this morning. You sat like a
[1:03:11] statue through the whole service. You
[1:03:13] couldn't have the breakthrough.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; I'm saying now, we're going to break
[1:03:16] chains.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; We're going to break chains right now.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:03:22] Glory be to God. Amen. Let's sing.

[1:05:14] One more time. There's nothing that I
[1:05:16] [singing] need.
[1:05:18] There is nothing that [music] I need
[1:05:20] that he won't provide. There is
[1:05:24] [singing and music] nothing that I need

[1:23:21] bring us back in the appointed time,
[1:23:23] Father, continue to bless us and may
[1:23:24] revelation be in attendance. Father,
[1:23:26] bless your musicians, bless the convenor
[1:23:28] this morning, Lord, the elders of the
[1:23:30] church, the office builders, Father.
[1:23:32] Father, just bring us back and we want
[1:23:33] to have, [singing] Lord, a more glorious
[1:23:35] time. You said every day with Jesus
[1:23:36] [music] is sweeter than the day before.
[1:23:38] So, we thank you Lord. We give you all
[1:23:40] the glory, the praise and the honor in
[1:23:41] the [singing and music] mighty name of
[1:23:42] Jesus.
