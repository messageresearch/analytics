[21:05] other visitors we welcome you in Jesus
[21:06] name amen let's turn to our Bible I want
[21:09] to speak this morning for a little
[21:11] thought amen glimpses of the god man and
[21:15] speaking on allowing your Revelation to
[21:17] find
[21:18] expression because whatever we believe
[21:21] you must become yes we can't be
[21:23] professors of the word we can't be only
[21:26] professing things we need to become what
[21:28] we are now preaching about we need to
[21:30] become what we are teaching about amen
[21:33] hallelujah so let's turn to Genesis 126
[21:36] we'll take our Origins from there amen
[21:39] been dealing with the scripture for a
[21:40] while
[21:41] [Music]
[21:43] amen Genesis 12 126 reads and God said
[21:47] let us make man in our image after our
[21:51] likeness and let them have dominion over
[21:54] the fish of the sea the foul of the air
[21:56] over the cattle over all the Earth and
[21:59] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[22:01] upon the
[22:02] Earth so God created man in his own
[22:04] image in the image of God created he him
[22:07] male and female created he them so now
[22:10] God is God of the heavens and he going
[22:12] to give man rule over the Earth God will
[22:15] do nothing upon the earth except he work
[22:17] through a man amen amen let's turn to
[22:19] Psalm 115 to confirm that amen praise
[22:21] the Lord psalm 115:15
[22:29] Psalm 115:15 says you are blessed of the
[22:32] Lord which made Heaven and
[22:34] Earth amen you are blessed of the Lord
[22:37] which made Heaven and Earth the heavens
[22:39] even the heavens are the
[22:41] Lords but the Earth had he given to the
[22:44] children of men amen everybody reading
[22:47] that in the Bible amen who does the
[22:49] heavens belong
[22:50] toen and who was the earth given to man
[22:54] that's why he said let them have
[22:57] dominion amen the Lord had blessing to
[22:59] the reading of his word you may be
[23:01] seated
[23:03] Hallelujah so we are moving now in our
[23:05] journey to perfect Faith amen amen now
[23:08] is not the time to back down now is not
[23:10] the time to settle down Now's the Time
[23:13] to move full steam ahead amen into what
[23:16] God has called us to do in this time and
[23:18] season amen we have a commission we have
[23:21] a mandate that we need to fulfill on the
[23:23] earth and don't let your life expire
[23:26] without you fulfilling God's plan for
[23:28] your life amen all of us have a mandate
[23:32] all of us have a commission from the
[23:34] Lord something that the Lord wants to
[23:36] use us for and we can't allow ourselves
[23:38] to go to the Grave for those potentials
[23:41] hidden and locked up amen amen
[23:45] hallelujah so we got to ask ourselves
[23:46] Lord what's your plan for me reveal it
[23:49] to me so that I can fulfill your plan
[23:51] because no man knows his days on the
[23:54] earth amen so we must be quick amen we
[23:57] must be swift to to work while we can
[23:59] amen amen hallelujah so we're looking
[24:02] here and and we were looking at aren't
[24:04] you glad that you were made in the image
[24:06] of God amen amen I when I read that it
[24:08] just makes me so excited I wasn't made
[24:11] in the image of an animal I wasn't made
[24:13] in the image of a monkey or chimpanzee
[24:15] but God thought about me amen he formed
[24:19] me in the back part of his mind from
[24:20] before the foundation of the
[24:23] world and he said let us make man in our
[24:25] own image meaning that the that God
[24:29] would make man is from his own self amen
[24:32] we are from the God's substance amen
[24:34] this man will function like God that's
[24:37] what amen likeness means to function
[24:40] like God Made In His Image to have his
[24:42] character and his nature so the only one
[24:46] the closest that the people on the Earth
[24:48] will see to God's love is your love the
[24:51] closest that God they will see to God's
[24:53] faith is your faith amen amen so we have
[24:56] got to present hope to Dying World we
[24:59] have got to present the gospel to a
[25:01] Dying World because out there they are
[25:03] hopeless out there they are searching
[25:05] for answers and the only ones that have
[25:07] the answer is the Bride of the Lord
[25:09] Jesus
[25:10] Christ
[25:12] amen so Deuteronomy 11:24 says and now
[25:16] he's talking here to the children of
[25:18] Israel Moses and Joshua he says every
[25:21] place where are The Souls of your feet
[25:23] shall tread shall be yours amen amen
[25:26] amen hallelujah yes he's not talking
[25:29] about somebody sitting idly he's talking
[25:32] about a person who is walking into
[25:34] Victory he's not talking about somebody
[25:37] who's comfortable being seated in a
[25:39] place and allowing other people to fight
[25:42] battles when he's saying every place
[25:45] where on the souls of your foot shall
[25:46] tread shall be yours God is expecting
[25:49] movement from you
[25:51] amen God is expecting you to advance the
[25:53] kingdom yes amen God is expecting you to
[25:56] ascend the Heavenly Realm yes Wonder
[25:59] amen there are dimensions to the Holy
[26:01] Ghost and some people are just satisfied
[26:04] with just a baby process yes amen
[26:07] hallelujah but there are dimensions to
[26:09] the Holy Ghost which we must Ascend and
[26:11] allow him to have his full expression
[26:13] through
[26:15] usen amen every place where on the souls
[26:18] of your feet shall tread shall be yours
[26:20] so Joshua had a work to do Joshua can't
[26:23] sit in a house Joshua must be on the
[26:26] Move amen amen Joshua must be conquering
[26:29] territory amen now when the Lord is
[26:31] speaking to Joshua in Joshua 1:8 he's
[26:34] telling him that the book of the law
[26:36] shall not depart out of thy
[26:39] mouth amen so you've got to keep the
[26:41] word on your mouth amen you've got to
[26:43] keep the word of God on your lips amen
[26:46] amen you've got to speak the word of God
[26:48] because the word of God is the most
[26:50] powerful weapon given to a Believer
[26:52] he'll defeat Satan any time any place on
[26:56] any grounds any Circ circumstance can
[26:59] you say Amen to that amen so the book of
[27:02] the Lord shall not depart from thy mouth
[27:04] but Thou shalt meditate there in day and
[27:07] night Glory oh what a what a call we've
[27:10] been asked to come now now remember this
[27:12] is preparation for the battle amen this
[27:15] is now the instruction before he's
[27:17] winning battles before he's conquering
[27:20] territories he's telling you to First
[27:22] learn the word of the Lord keep it in
[27:25] your mouth you can't go into battle
[27:27] based on your own words right you've got
[27:29] to know the word of Goden amen
[27:32] hallelujah so he's saying don't let it
[27:34] depart from your mouth meditate therein
[27:36] day and night amen he's not asking you
[27:39] to meditate on Netflix day and night
[27:41] he's not asking you to meditate on
[27:43] movies or worldly music or things of
[27:45] this world day and night but he's asking
[27:47] you to meditate on the word of the
[27:51] Lord that thou mayest observe to do
[27:54] according to all that is written therein
[27:57] you see every action of ours are based
[28:00] on the word of God and what's written in
[28:02] the word of God that's how we begin to
[28:05] function like God amen amen we become
[28:08] the word made flesh for then Thou shalt
[28:11] make thy way prosperous you see a lot of
[28:14] people want that second part they want
[28:16] prosperity in life they want success in
[28:19] life but they don't want the word of
[28:23] God Amen he's showing you the paths of
[28:26] success in your life
[28:28] amen amen meditate on the word keep it
[28:31] in your mouth do according to all that
[28:33] the word is written then Thou shalt have
[28:36] make thy way prosperous and then thou
[28:39] shall have good
[28:41] success amen
[28:43] hallelujah have not I commanded thee be
[28:46] strong and of a good courage Be not
[28:49] Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the
[28:52] Lord thy God is with thee withs soever

[35:46] bit Glory you'll see a glimpse of a God
[35:49] man amen just to back it up John 1 140
[35:54] just to show you who this Peter is one
[35:56] of the two which CH John's
[35:58] speak and followed him was Andrew Simon
[36:01] Peter's
[36:02] brother he first finded his own brother
[36:04] Simon and said unto him we have found
[36:07] the Messiah which is being interpreted
[36:09] the
[36:10] Christ now you remember that in Matthew
[36:13] chapter
[36:14] 16 Jesus is going to ask him who do you
[36:17] say I am so now the seed is already
[36:20] planted in Peter who this is do you see
[36:24] it in the
[36:26] word does he not tell Jesus Thou Art the
[36:29] Christ but where is he getting the
[36:31] teaching
[36:32] from so he's walking around with this
[36:35] revelation of who Jesus
[36:37] is yes because Andrew introduces this he
[36:41] says we have found the Messiah which
[36:43] being interpreted the
[36:47] Christ and he brought him to Jesus and
[36:50] when Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art
[36:52] Simon the son of Jonah but you know
[36:56] what I I see you with
[36:58] potential amen I think I need to change
[37:01] your name amen yes hallelujah amen the
[37:06] name you got now is okay maybe your
[37:09] Earthly mother and father gave you that
[37:10] name but I see a potential in you Peter
[37:13] amen I see I can work with someone like
[37:16] you you may be rough around the edges
[37:19] you may be not fitting into the norm of
[37:21] society you may be a sinking fisherman
[37:24] amen you know Peter was a wild guy the
[37:27] Bible says he went fishing naked and
[37:28] things like this you
[37:30] know he wasn't your polished guy with a
[37:33] suit amen you know Peter was a bit rough
[37:37] there when they came to Jesus in the
[37:39] Garden of Eden he cut the servant's ear
[37:41] off amen I need a Peter in my
[37:46] life amen
[37:48] hallelujah and you know Jesus took all
[37:51] the evidence
[37:53] away amen Jesus put that ear back
[37:57] because it was a capital
[38:00] punishment for him to cut off the high
[38:02] priest servant's ear they would have
[38:04] killed Peter there so Jesus took away
[38:07] the evidence amen hallelujah he can take
[38:12] away any evidence of sickness disease or
[38:14] illness even before your next doctor's
[38:16] appointment somebody receive that even
[38:18] before your next doctor's appointment
[38:20] amen there will be no trace of it even
[38:22] the doctors will be baffled he'll take
[38:24] away every evidence of it thank you
[38:27] you'll even fight with the doctor and
[38:28] say you told me I had this
[38:31] thing wonderful thank
[38:34] you amen amen Thou Art Simon the son of
[38:38] Jonah thou sht be called sephus which is
[38:41] by interpretation a
[38:44] stone now we know that Peter had a
[38:46] revelation of the Lord Jesus
[38:48] Christ and that was amen that Revelation
[38:52] was the revelation of who Jesus Christ
[38:55] was amen so we find here in Matthew
[38:58] chapter 16 we'll go to that point now
[39:01] verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast
[39:04] of cesaria Philippi he asked his
[39:06] disciples saying who do men say that I
[39:09] the son of man
[39:11] am and they said some say that thou are
[39:13] John the Baptist some Elias and others
[39:16] Jeremiah or one of the prophets amen you
[39:21] see they were delving into the Bible but
[39:22] they couldn't scripturally identify
[39:26] Jesus they bypassed Isaiah 9 Isaiah 7
[39:30] amen they're bypassing Isaiah
[39:32] 61 amen they're bypassing all of these
[39:37] scriptures and he says to them who do
[39:40] you I need to know who youth say that I
[39:43] am I'm ask you who do you say that Jesus
[39:46] is
[39:47] am and Simon answered and said Thou Art
[39:50] the Christ the son of the Living God
[39:56] Amen and Jesus answered and said unto
[39:58] him blessed are thou Simon B Jonah for
[40:02] Flesh and Blood had not revealed it unto
[40:04] thee but my Father which is in heaven
[40:08] amen amen every Revelation comes from
[40:10] above
[40:13] amen didn't Jesus say that to you it is
[40:16] given to know the mysteries of the
[40:18] Kingdom
[40:20] Hallelujah and I say unto thee Thou Art
[40:23] Peter and Upon This Rock what rock he
[40:27] wasn't going to build it upon Peter like
[40:29] the Catholic Church
[40:32] says the Catholic Church misinterprets
[40:34] the scripture and he says Peter was the
[40:37] Rock and he built the church upon Peter
[40:40] so Peter was the first pope that's an
[40:42] incorrect reading of that verse amen
[40:46] when he says Upon This Rock he's meaning
[40:48] the Revelation that you have Peter I'm
[40:51] going to build my kingdom my church I
[40:53] will build my church now notice there
[40:56] personal
[40:58] I will build my church Jesus Takes
[41:01] responsibility for his own church amen
[41:03] this is not my church Hallelujah this is
[41:06] the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ no
[41:08] Pastor no Bishop no Archbishop has

[41:27] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[41:30] against it what is the it Revelation yes
[41:34] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[41:37] your revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[41:39] amen amen you know what that is I me if
[41:43] you can see that Jesus is speaking a
[41:45] prophetic word yes amen that even 2,000
[41:48] years may pass but the Gates of Hell
[41:50] shall not Prevail against the revelation

[42:27] the attacked from the gates of hell they
[42:29] come against you amen yes amen the gates
[42:32] of hell are coming against you Jesus

[42:36] violence and the violent take it by
[42:38] force I want you to know that the
[42:40] kingdom of God is within you so when the

[43:01] Christ amen I can live my life and enjoy
[43:04] life on the
[43:05] [Music]
[43:06] earth amen people don't realize that
[43:09] they ought to be amen not their own they

[43:14] with the Precious Blood of the Lord
[43:15] Jesus Christ amen you owe your life to
[43:17] Jesus you owe your life young man young
[43:20] woman to serve the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:22] amen amen maybe you're thinking you got

[43:47] they're coming now the gates of hell are
[43:49] coming against you you feeling the
[43:51] pressure from all sides amen hallelujah
[43:55] but where what who are you you Mount
[43:57] Zion so the gates of hell are coming
[43:59] among are coming against Mount Zion yes
[44:03] amen that's what the Bible says amen and
[44:05] and here in Isaiah 14 it says it's
[44:07] coming against the sides of the
[44:09] north yes Satan said I will sit upon the
[44:14] sides of the north the sides of the
[44:16] north is Mount Zion a type of the Bride
[44:19] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah
[44:23] but you are going to overcome that now I
[44:25] want you to pay attention to Isaiah 4
[44:27] 14: 13 if you go and look at that
[44:29] interpretation of sit that word doesn't
[44:32] mean just I will sit upon the sides of
[44:34] the north that word sit means to
[44:37] marry go look it up he says I will sit
[44:41] upon the Mount of the congregation in
[44:43] the sides of the north meaning that
[44:46] Satan wants to take you in for his wife
[44:50] that's
[44:51] right the same thing he did in the
[44:53] Garden of Eden through the serpent
[44:56] before Adam got to to his wife he got to
[44:59] Eve amen so with this with Jesus Christ
[45:03] is called the last Adam so he wants to
[45:06] make a move on the wife of the Lord
[45:07] Jesus Christ and he wants to sit upon
[45:10] the Mount of the
[45:11] congregation Amen on the sides of the
[45:14] north amen but the Bible prophesies and
[45:17] said you want to sit on the sides of the
[45:19] north you'll be brought down to the pit
[45:21] amen hallelujah God won't allow anyone
[45:24] to touch his bride God won't allow want
[45:27] to touch his
[45:28] people amen so a prophetic word is
[45:31] spoken over you the Gates of Hell cannot
[45:33] Prevail against you you shall overcome
[45:36] every attack of the enemy you will
[45:38] defeat Satan and his army with the word
[45:40] of God that has been released to you
[45:43] amen the word that you carry the
[45:46] Revelation that you carry amen defeats
[45:48] the Gates of Hell makes Satan powerless
[45:51] before you the reason why Satan is not
[45:54] powerless before you you don't speak the
[45:56] word yes amen you've got to take the
[45:58] word into the Battleground amen amen
[46:01] there is no fear no doubt no reasoning
[46:04] there's nothing in this bride that Satan
[46:06] can work through Satan can only work
[46:09] through doubt Satan can only work
[46:10] through fear Satan can only work through
[46:13] reasoning but amen the word of God comes
[46:15] to take away all of that so Satan can
[46:17] find nothing that he can work through
[46:20] amen amen hallelujah and how does God
[46:23] Work hello him God can only work by his
[46:27] word that's his law he works by the
[46:30] logos he finds expression through the
[46:33] logos so therefore he puts his word in
[46:35] you so that he can work through you he
[46:38] can only find expression through the
[46:39] word so if you've got things inside of
[46:42] you beside the word God can't work amen
[46:45] amen praise the Lord and the bride is
[46:48] built on the word amen we know the bride
[46:49] lives by the word the bride moves by the
[46:52] word the bride breaths by the word of
[46:54] God Amen you talk about a military might
[46:57] and strength you shall see this when the
[46:59] bride is fully clothed with the word of
[47:01] God a military army amenallah yeah in
[47:05] Mark 9:23 Jesus is saying if thou can
[47:08] believe some things are possible to
[47:19] you no we don't believe in certain
[47:22] things some things are Beyond us
[47:27] we Opera in a much higher
[47:30] level so we scratch out things that we
[47:33] don't agree
[47:36] with amen if thou can't believe all
[47:40] things
[47:41] amen all things are possible yes young
[47:45] boy young girl brothers and sisters I
[47:48] don't care how small that thing is you
[47:50] may be thinking it's an insignificant
[47:53] thing but God says all things amen are
[47:57] possible to God who
[48:00] believes
[48:02] sorry to God that
[48:07] believes all things are possible to him
[48:11] that
[48:12] believeth Mark 11:23 what does it
[48:16] says if you go to pray and you ask God
[48:19] and God says to the mountain be thou
[48:22] removed right Mark 11:23 says that that
[48:25] you are weak and hopeless and you're so
[48:27] feeble in this life go to God in prayer
[48:31] and if God says to the mountain be thou
[48:35] removed what does it
[48:39] say so God's name is
[48:43] whosoever who's that
[48:47] whosoever
[48:48] amen whosoever shall say unto this
[48:52] mountain this obstacle this circumstance
[48:57] amen be thou removed that is not
[49:00] somebody like a
[49:02] that's a voice of authority amen
[49:06] be thou removed cast into the sea but
[49:10] here's the key anyone can speak right
[49:14] anyone can speak here's the
[49:18] key you speak but he says don't doubt in
[49:22] his
[49:23] heart there's the key now but believe
[49:26] those those things which he he saith not
[49:29] what God saith which he saith shall come
[49:33] to pass and he shall have whatsoever he
[49:37] saith amen God wants you to have
[49:40] confidence in your own word yes God has
[49:42] equipped you with his word he has
[49:44] confidence in you as a
[49:46] son and he wants you to speak over your
[49:49] situation death and life lay in the
[49:52] power of the tongue yes so what are you
[49:55] speaking you know why you speak that way
[49:57] or don't speak lack of speaking is
[49:59] because out of the abundance of the
[50:01] heart the mouth speaks so you got to go
[50:03] and look at your heart condition what is
[50:05] the condition of my heart amen because
[50:08] out of the abundance of my heart I am
[50:10] going to speak yes amen so your heart

[50:14] fearful Matthew 17:20 nothing shall be
[50:18] impossible unto you yes nothing shall be
[50:23] impossible unto you

[50:32] Matthew chapter 16 and verse 19 says I
[50:35] will give unto you the Keys of the
[50:37] Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever thou
[50:39] bind on Earth shall be bound in

[50:52] heaven oh church can you see what
[50:54] Authority you carry amen can you see
[50:57] what you carry amen you're a son and
[50:59] daughter of God and God wants to place
[51:01] the responsibility upon you stop being
[51:04] childish stop being a babe in Christ
[51:07] amen you need to grow up to maturity
[51:09] tell your neighbor grow
[51:12] up amen tell your neighbor to grow
[51:17] up grow
[51:21] up we have to grow up in Christ
[51:24] Ephesians 4 says we must grow up up in
[51:26] the things of Christ amen amen amen now
[51:31] in the time of need what do we do what
[51:32] are we called to do according to the
[51:34] word run to the pastor because Mark 16
[51:39] says if the pastor lays down upon the
[51:41] sick they shall
[51:44] recover never mind now you went to visit
[51:47] the hospital right you went visiting
[51:49] ours you went 2 to 4 because you're free

[51:58] stories how you feeling this that you
[52:01] see you got them into the
[52:03] emotions and when you left you said

[52:09] you I'll tell my pastor to come pray for
[52:15] you you know my aunt passed away last
[52:19] week we went to the hospital brother
[52:22] Joshua was there some of the family
[52:23] members were there
[52:27] there's other people came there they
[52:29] didn't care that we were there they were
[52:31] leaving and they asked can we pray
[52:34] before we
[52:36] leave that is having confidence in what
[52:39] you believe now I'll have you know that
[52:41] was a
[52:42] sister not a mage sister but she
[52:47] knew she had the confidence in a prayer
[52:51] wonderful am now I ask you not to make
[52:54] you feel bad how many of you would have
[52:56] done that would you have felt
[52:59] embarrassed would you have felt ah what
[53:02] they going to think about me or do you
[53:05] feel like you represent the kingdom you
[53:07] carry the kingdom within you amen amen
[53:10] and you tell them no I don't care how
[53:12] simple your prayer is even if you don't
[53:15] know how to pray you can quote back the
[53:17] word of God therefore you've got to know
[53:19] the word you can even quote Mark 16 Lord
[53:21] your word says if I lay hands upon the
[53:23] sick they shall recover won't you come
[53:25] and honor your word I'm a Believer and
[53:27] I'm laying hands upon the
[53:31] sick we need spiritually strong Sons and
[53:35] Daughters of God Amen we can't be 30 40
[53:39] years amen with the revealed word of the
[53:42] hour and operating with no Authority no
[53:45] power you know even in the natural for
[53:48] you to become qualified in something you
[53:51] study three years to get a
[53:54] degree 3 years only
[53:57] to get a
[54:00] degree how many of you have been in the
[54:02] Christian faith more than 3
[54:05] years
[54:07] amen now in the 3 years you must study
[54:10] all of that manual whatever books they
[54:13] give you right you must study the
[54:15] material they give you after 3 years
[54:18] they put you through a test in an
[54:19] [Music]
[54:21] exam and after 3 years if you pass that
[54:25] exam when you are now in practice you no
[54:28] longer rely on the
[54:30] material because why you are now the
[54:33] material
[54:36] am hallelu so I ask you in your
[54:39] Christian
[54:40] faith why would you
[54:44] qualified 20 years 15 years 10 years
[54:47] going on in
[54:49] faith but walking around as a son with
[54:51] no
[54:52] Authority amen can't give hope to the
[54:56] Hopeless no can't give strength to the
[55:00] feeble
[55:02] amen something is wrong then now we need
[55:06] to ask ourselves am I really a part of
[55:08] the kingdom of God am I really a part of
[55:10] God's program in my life or am I just a
[55:13] church
[55:15] member because you can't just be a
[55:17] church member and you can die like
[55:20] that and you that you won't be
[55:22] functioning in his kingdom right amen
[55:25] and that's a pitiful sight yeah amen
[55:28] that's a sad thing to happen to
[55:31] us
[55:33] amen be strong be strong Christians
[55:37] somebody in the home gets sick you be
[55:39] the one to pray yes whether it's your
[55:42] husband don't feel shy whether it's a
[55:44] wife
[55:47] pray you see we've got to recognize the
[55:49] grace that we carry the anointing that
[55:52] we carry and if you and I can't
[55:54] recognize it in one another the outside
[55:56] world won't recognize it if you and I
[55:59] cannot respect that here the outside
[56:01] world cannot respect it because when it
[56:04] comes to spiritual warfare there is Rank
[56:06] and
[56:08] Authority that's how the kingdom
[56:10] operates the Centurion detailed it for
[56:12] us when he went to Jesus he said I speak
[56:16] I'm a man I'm a I have I'm a man who's
[56:18] under Authority but I also I have
[56:20] authority over 100 men I speak to one
[56:23] and he goes and does
[56:25] it now now here in the kingdom of God if
[56:28] the Deacon tells somebody something you
[56:30] get who you think he
[56:35] is hey I know the pastor so long I know
[56:38] the pastor more long than
[56:40] him it don't matter you know the
[56:44] pastor you follow the authority of the
[56:46] church amen amen hallelujah now when the
[56:50] word is coming strong like the previous
[56:52] pastor
[56:56] he wasn't so hard like
[56:59] this
[57:02] amen you've got to understand how the
[57:04] kingdom
[57:06] operates Hallelujah they are
[57:08] principalities yes they are powers amen
[57:13] hallelujah and if we can't operate in
[57:16] that level of authority and I'm sad to
[57:18] say this but some of us don't know how
[57:20] to function with that level of respect
[57:22] and
[57:24] Authority if you want to see the go to
[57:26] the denominational world and you'll see
[57:28] it evident
[57:30] there they respect the man of
[57:34] God because they know he carries an
[57:37] anointing now how much more us will know
[57:40] that Ephesians 4 is a fivefold Ministry
[57:42] a gift of God that He gave some Apostles
[57:45] teachers prophets pastors evangelists to
[57:47] the church for the
[57:49] edification Amen to bring us into the
[57:52] stature of
[57:53] Christ amen let's just get to the part
[57:56] will close amen now this man is packing
[57:58] Peter he's packing this revelation of
[58:00] who Jesus
[58:02] is and he's going to come into a time
[58:05] now we'll pick it up here in
[58:08] uh Amen in the Book of Matthew chapter
[58:13] 14 we'll read from verse
[58:16] 22 we're going to close with this point
[58:18] now so amen pay attention and straight
[58:21] way Jesus constrained his disciples to
[58:24] get into a ship
[58:28] so I don't have time to detail this
[58:29] later so I'm going to pick up the
[58:30] highlights now God put them in that
[58:33] position Jesus put them on the
[58:35] ship so don't care what your situation
[58:38] is don't blame God God has put you there
[58:40] for a reason oh yes he wants to see how
[58:42] you function he wants to see how you
[58:45] handle the situation God put all Jesus
[58:48] put all of his 12 disciples
[58:52] there on the ship
[58:56] and to go before him unto the other side
[58:59] where he sent the multitudes away and
[59:01] when he had sent the multitudes away he
[59:03] went up into a mountain apart to pray
[59:06] and when the evening was come he was
[59:08] there alone but the ship was now in the
[59:11] midst of the
[59:14] sea
[59:15] amen I want to tie this with end time
[59:18] events as well very quickly amen now
[59:20] notice in the midst of the
[59:23] sea because in Revelation 13 there's a
[59:26] beast rising from the midst of the
[59:32] sea right but the ship was now in the
[59:35] midst of the sea tossed with waves and
[59:38] the wind was contrary now we know that
[59:41] winds means Wars and
[59:44] strife I'm trying to show you it's when
[59:46] end time condition people that will rise
[59:48] up like Peter
[59:50] now come on this is not just a Bible
[59:53] story because watch what the next verse
[59:55] says so winds means Wars and strife that
[59:58] means spiritual
[1:00:01] warfare and in the fourth
[1:00:07] watch in the fourth
[1:00:10] right in the Fourth
[1:00:13] Watch Jesus went unto them walking on
[1:00:17] the
[1:00:19] sea amen Jesus is coming at the fourth
[1:00:23] watch the time when the fourth hor Rider
[1:00:25] is coming coming the time when all hell
[1:00:28] he's following the rider amen I'm now in
[1:00:30] Revelation chapter 4 chapter 3 amen you
[1:00:33] know that's Revelation chapter 3 amen
[1:00:36] hallelujah sorry Revelation chapter 6
[1:00:40] where he's talking about the Riders amen
[1:00:43] so he's in the fourth watch but remember
[1:00:45] there's a fourth anointing which is the
[1:00:47] flying eagle and there's a fourth Us
[1:00:51] Rider but here Jesus comes unto them in
[1:00:53] the fourth hour that fourth hour what of
[1:00:56] the night is between 3: and 6:00 in the
[1:01:00] morning
[1:01:02] Hallelujah when is 3 and six just before
[1:01:06] 6 and
[1:01:09] N just before the
[1:01:12] Rapture
[1:01:15] hallelujah praise the Lord follow me now
[1:01:18] and when the disciples saw him walking
[1:01:20] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[1:01:22] is a spirit and they cried out for fear
[1:01:26] but straight away Jesus spake unto them
[1:01:28] saying be of good cheer it is I Be not
[1:01:35] Afraid and Peter answered him and said
[1:01:37] Lord if it be thou but me come unto thee
[1:01:41] on the water and he said come and when
[1:01:44] Peter was come down out of the ship he
[1:01:46] walked on the water to get to to go to
[1:01:48] Jesus but when he saw the wind was
[1:01:51] boisterous he was afraid and began to
[1:01:54] sink and he cried saying Lord save
[1:01:58] me now I want you to picture the scene
[1:02:00] as we close
[1:02:02] now all other 11 disciples are there as
[1:02:06] well but only one
[1:02:08] man rises
[1:02:12] up the Church of Jesus Christ is on the
[1:02:15] ship
[1:02:17] together they are settled there these
[1:02:20] men have been through Troublesome waters
[1:02:22] before because if you notice in this
[1:02:24] story they are not crying out to Jesus
[1:02:26] for
[1:02:30] help the only reason they cried out they
[1:02:33] thought it was a spirit coming towards
[1:02:35] them and they got afraid they were not
[1:02:38] crying out to Jesus Lord save us this
[1:02:40] was not the time when Jesus was asleep
[1:02:42] on the
[1:02:43] boat when Jesus said care when they told
[1:02:46] Jesus carest thou not that we perish
[1:02:48] this was another time am so they had
[1:02:51] been these men were fishermen some of
[1:02:53] them so they had known how to handle the
[1:02:57] waters but the winds were
[1:02:59] boisterous Wars and strife coming upon
[1:03:02] them I'm talking about supernatural
[1:03:04] Warfare coming against the body of
[1:03:07] Christ and the 11 disciples are content
[1:03:10] staying in the
[1:03:15] boat so the Bible says when he saw that
[1:03:18] the wind was boisterous he was afraid
[1:03:21] what happened he took his eyes off of
[1:03:23] Jesus
[1:03:28] right and immediately Jesus stretched
[1:03:31] forth his hand and caught him and said
[1:03:33] unto him oh thou of little faith
[1:03:35] wherefore do thou doubt and when they
[1:03:39] were come in when they were come into
[1:03:41] the ship the wind seized amen then they
[1:03:45] that were in the ship came and worshiped
[1:03:47] him saying of a truth Thou Art the Son
[1:03:50] of
[1:03:51] God hallelujah
[1:03:53] amen now I just want to go to the Beast
[1:03:56] of the sea there in Revelation chap 13
[1:03:58] to show you that this was no ordinary
[1:04:01] storm Jesus saw all of Satan saw all of
[1:04:04] them together on the ship and he thought
[1:04:06] I could kill them all in one shot I'll
[1:04:08] kill the entire
[1:04:11] church and I stood upon the sand of the
[1:04:14] sea and saw a beast rise up out of the
[1:04:16] sea and upon his heads the name of
[1:04:18] blasphemy and the dragon gave him his
[1:04:20] power and his seat and great Authority
[1:04:23] and it was given unto him to make war
[1:04:25] with the sins and to overcome
[1:04:28] them so winds we said means Wars and
[1:04:30] strife amen praise the Lord now before
[1:04:34] we get into that story a little bit I
[1:04:35] want to read this quote he says that in
[1:04:37] this life we are Body Soul and Spirit
[1:04:40] right we operate by five senses see
[1:04:44] taste feel smell and hear given to
[1:04:47] contact your Earthly home they were not
[1:04:50] given to contact your heavenly
[1:04:52] home these there's actually six senses
[1:04:55] in human body see taste feel smell here
[1:04:58] and Faith his faith sets his
[1:05:03] destination now your faith is going to
[1:05:05] set your destination for your
[1:05:07] life amen faith is a substance of things
[1:05:10] hoped for evidence of things you do not
[1:05:13] see taste feel smell or ear but by faith
[1:05:16] when he catches the word it sends him
[1:05:18] into a dimension that makes it so real
[1:05:21] to him till it's just as good as he's
[1:05:24] got in his hand he knows it's going to
[1:05:27] happen that's what happened here now to
[1:05:29] Peter now my question to you is are you
[1:05:32] comfortable in the message
[1:05:34] boat amen are you comfortable going with
[1:05:38] the
[1:05:40] crowd because there's no move of God in
[1:05:42] the
[1:05:44] boat nobody asked Peter to get out of
[1:05:46] the
[1:05:47] boat Jesus never called him out of the
[1:05:50] boat it was
[1:05:53] himself that desired to go to where
[1:05:56] Jesus was he knew it was better where
[1:05:59] Jesus was than it was in the boat he
[1:06:01] knew it's safer to be where Jesus was
[1:06:03] than to be in the boat
[1:06:06] amen amen now the other 11 may have said
[1:06:10] Peter what are you doing come back in
[1:06:12] the boat come back to
[1:06:15] safety we know the safety of the message
[1:06:18] we know the safety of our
[1:06:20] doctrines why do you want to be like a
[1:06:22] god man
[1:06:25] now the Bible says that they were
[1:06:27] terrified when they saw Jesus walking on
[1:06:29] the
[1:06:30] water and Jesus said it is I Be not
[1:06:33] Afraid only one man responded to that am
[1:06:37] amen who the rock of
[1:06:39] Revelation because faith is a revelation
[1:06:42] amen and Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:06:46] church am amen even though the winds are
[1:06:49] beating on your boat even though the
[1:06:51] winds are beating on your ship are you
[1:06:53] still comfortable with your situation
[1:06:58] amen you know the safer option would
[1:07:00] have been for Peter to remain in the
[1:07:03] boat because the waves were
[1:07:08] high rather than jump in the water amen
[1:07:11] it was safer to stay in the
[1:07:14] boat
[1:07:15] Hallelujah but he saw the master of the
[1:07:19] wind walking on water now notice
[1:07:22] something about Peter he never marveled
[1:07:26] he never stood there and said I will
[1:07:27] stand back now and witness this great
[1:07:30] Jesus walking on
[1:07:33] water Peter immediately knew that this
[1:07:37] was the
[1:07:38] Redeemer and to redeem means to bring
[1:07:40] back to your original
[1:07:42] condition so he never stood there to
[1:07:44] admire Jesus walking on the water he
[1:07:47] said if Jesus can do it I can do it
[1:07:55] if Jesus can walk on water I can walk on
[1:07:59] wateren yes Peter don't step out the
[1:08:02] Bible says he stepped down out of the
[1:08:05] boat and he must have put his first foot
[1:08:07] in the water and the message church was
[1:08:09] calling don't step out onto
[1:08:12] faith stay with
[1:08:15] theology it's safer here but Peter dared
[1:08:19] to be bold amen Peter dared Amen to step
[1:08:23] out onto the waters by faith amen
[1:08:26] amen hallelujah let's read that again
[1:08:28] what he says here he says and pet when
[1:08:31] Peter screams Lord if it be thou put me
[1:08:35] come to unto thee on the water yes and
[1:08:40] he just needed one
[1:08:42] word Jesus didn't say a whole lot of
[1:08:44] words Jesus said come amen now that word
[1:08:48] come is very important because when he
[1:08:50] said come and Peter responded Peter the
[1:08:53] super anointing Came Upon Peter and he
[1:08:56] was caught up into a f
[1:08:58] Dimension a world that people knew
[1:09:00] nothing about after that Peter was not
[1:09:02] the same amen because Peter Peter
[1:09:05] stepped into the world of perfect Faith
[1:09:07] the disciples thought he was ordinary
[1:09:09] the disciples thought he was
[1:09:11] crazy I'm asking you don't allow people
[1:09:14] to end your faith if youve got the faith
[1:09:16] to step out onto water don't allow
[1:09:19] others to stop you I'm talking about
[1:09:22] even in your personal life if God has
[1:09:24] revealed something to you don't allow
[1:09:26] the naysayers to hold you
[1:09:27] [Applause]
[1:09:30] back God called you to do it and
[1:09:33] sometimes you might you might be the
[1:09:34] only one that has that word from the
[1:09:36] Lord like
[1:09:38] Abraham God may have only spoken to you
[1:09:40] and you are the only one that can carry
[1:09:42] out the assignment amen so I must put
[1:09:45] out every other voice and listen to the
[1:09:47] voice of God that same word that said
[1:09:49] come he's the same one in Revelation 4
[1:09:52] that says John come up come amen glory
[1:09:56] to God amen hallelujah amen what is that
[1:10:00] the world of perfect Faith amen the
[1:10:03] world of perfect
[1:10:05] Faith Amen Hallelujah Jesus lived in
[1:10:08] this world of perfect Faith amen so
[1:10:10] don't be comfortable in the boat amen
[1:10:13] hallelujah who has coming to Jesus I
[1:10:15] mean sorry who has coming to the
[1:10:17] disciples Jesus and we know that Jesus
[1:10:19] is the essence of love and the Bible
[1:10:22] says in 1 John 4:18 there is no fear
[1:10:25] love but perfect love casted out fear so
[1:10:28] Jesus coming to them took away their
[1:10:31] fear Hallelujah so in the midst of your
[1:10:33] fears can you recognize his
[1:10:37] voice in the midst of your sickness can
[1:10:40] you call out to Jesus and say Lord If It
[1:10:43] Be Your Will can I come out of the
[1:10:45] sickness thank you Jesus Peter wanted to
[1:10:48] come out of the boat because the boat
[1:10:50] was the
[1:10:51] problem because the boat was swaying in
[1:10:54] the water
[1:10:58] that's how life
[1:11:00] is life is like the
[1:11:04] waves it's Rocky
[1:11:07] sometimes it's not smooth sailing all
[1:11:09] the time amen people are tossed to and
[1:11:13] fro amen all kinds of things happening
[1:11:15] to people so Peter wanted to step out by
[1:11:19] faith amen hallelujah in the midst of
[1:11:21] your fear can you recognize the voice of
[1:11:24] God God put in that situation for a
[1:11:26] purpose if Peter was not put in that
[1:11:29] situation that Faith would have never
[1:11:30] been
[1:11:32] released we just read in the Bible Jesus
[1:11:35] asked them to go into the ship and we
[1:11:37] know that Jesus knew things he would
[1:11:39] have known that storm is
[1:11:43] coming but he allowed them to go through
[1:11:46] that season he allowed them to go
[1:11:48] through that trial why there was a
[1:11:50] nugget to be polished
[1:11:53] there now I know you know in the Human
[1:11:55] Condition most of us are very
[1:11:58] pessimistic most of us love to go
[1:12:00] through that verse where Peter fell down
[1:12:01] in the
