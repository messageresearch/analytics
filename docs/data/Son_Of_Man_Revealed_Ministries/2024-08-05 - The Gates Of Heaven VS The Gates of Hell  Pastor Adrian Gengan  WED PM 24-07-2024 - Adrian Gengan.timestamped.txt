[0:54] let's go to our Bibles
[0:57] hallelujah amen
[1:00] we speak a little thought amen the Gates
[1:02] of Heaven versus the Gates of Hell amen
[1:05] and I say that the Gates of Heaven is
[1:07] the gates of Revelation yes and the
[1:09] gates of hell is the gates of deception
[1:11] amen amen amen hallelujah Gates of Hell
[1:16] doesn't look like fire and you know
[1:19] like hey he comes by deception so the
[1:24] Gates of Heaven is revelation versing
[1:27] the Gates of Hell which is deception
[1:29] amen let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:31] 16 go to opening verse there Matthew
[1:33] chapter
[1:36] 16 praise the
[1:39] Lord we'll read from verse 13 when Jesus
[1:42] came into the coast of cesaria Philippi
[1:45] he asked his disciples saying who do men
[1:48] say that I the son of man
[1:50] am and they said some say that thou are
[1:53] John the Baptist some Elias and and
[1:56] others Jeremiah or one of the prophets
[2:00] so they were totally out of
[2:02] focus amen if they were looking through
[2:05] a rangefinder they were totally out of
[2:07] focus they couldn't scripturally
[2:09] identify who Jesus was amen
[2:13] amen he said unto them but who say he
[2:17] that I
[2:18] am amen now they are walking with the
[2:21] word Jesus so let's see how they
[2:26] focuses and Simon Peter answered and
[2:29] said Thou Art the Christ that's the
[2:32] anointed one that's the Messiah the Son
[2:34] of the Living God Amen and Jesus
[2:38] answered and said unto him blessed are
[2:40] thou how many of us can say tonight that
[2:44] amen that he is the Christ the son of
[2:46] the Living God Amen then the next words
[2:49] apply to us blessed are thou Simon B
[2:52] Jonah for flesh and blood and not
[2:55] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[2:57] which is in heaven now here Jesus is
[3:00] going to get prophetic and he says I say
[3:02] unto you unto thee Thou Art Peter and
[3:06] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[3:08] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[3:11] against it amen and I will give unto
[3:14] thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven
[3:17] and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[3:20] shall be bound in heaven yes amen and
[3:23] whatsoever thou shallal loose on Earth
[3:25] shall be loosed in heaven yes amen amen
[3:29] then charged these disciples that they
[3:31] should tell no man that he was Jesus the
[3:34] Christ amen hallelujah amen the Lord had
[3:38] blessings to the reading of his word you
[3:39] may be
[3:40] seated amen so the Gates of
[3:43] Hell amen are under
[3:46] attack hallelujah amen because the Gates
[3:49] of Heaven Revelation has been opened up
[3:52] amen hallelujah yes now we we were
[3:56] reading on Sunday about the the horse
[3:59] rider the foros rider and we know that's
[4:01] the rider that's going forth in
[4:03] Leia and he is riding now with a mixed
[4:07] color o meaning that all of those three
[4:10] powers have
[4:11] United and the prophet says every time
[4:14] there's a there's a mystery opens up it
[4:16] causes a religious
[4:18] disturbance it causes political
[4:22] disturbances I want you to know that the
[4:24] Gates of Heaven has caused political
[4:25] disturbances even now yes yes Hallelujah
[4:32] amen hallelujah when the Gates of Heaven
[4:35] are being preached when Revelation is
[4:37] being preached it's causing religious
[4:39] disturbance you see it shaking up
[4:42] political Realms you see it shaking up
[4:44] demonic Realms such is the word that we
[4:47] have today Hallelujah those four writers
[4:51] that we read as the apocalypse and it's
[4:53] doomsday coming amen not against the
[4:56] church that's a weaker Army than the
[4:59] army of Jesus Christ the army of Jesus
[5:01] Christ is an invincible Army she's a
[5:04] super Church she's a super race amen
[5:07] Satan and his army are no match for this
[5:09] bride of Jesus Christ she is fully
[5:12] equipped to the word she is fully
[5:14] equipped to the mind of Christ am amen
[5:17] now we know that only sons of God can
[5:19] come to maturity in this
[5:21] hour and you don't give the armor of God
[5:24] to Children
[5:26] yes therefore we're reading Ephesians 6
[5:29] M Ephesians 6 is coming at the end of
[5:32] the Ephesian the book of Ephesian and
[5:35] then he's equipping the one who was
[5:37] predestinated unto adoption in Ephesians
[5:40] 1 amen now come through a journey you
[5:43] must go through Ephesians 4 which is the
[5:45] five form Ministry amen because the five
[5:48] form ministry will bring you to your
[5:49] adoption amen amen therefore he
[5:52] progresses from Ephesians 4 Ephesians 5
[5:55] then Ephesians 6 when the church is
[5:58] fully mature when the church is ready to
[6:00] be adopted he now takes her and he puts
[6:03] her in a ceremony and he gives her the
[6:06] Garment amen gives the
[6:09] armor Hallelujah so only you don't give
[6:12] armor to children in training one who is
[6:16] under tutors and guides you don't give
[6:17] them armor then hallelujah but armor
[6:20] belongs to a
[6:22] Man armor belongs to a fully matur son
[6:25] and daughter of God Amen who is in the
[6:28] position and who knows how to use the
[6:31] weapons of their Warfare amen God
[6:34] doesn't give his power to Children yes
[6:37] he says unto Sons amen hallelujah amen
[6:42] amen he gave power to become the sons of
[6:45] God Amen power to sons of God Amen
[6:49] Hallelujah that's the gospel of
[6:51] Salvation amen hallelujah praise the
[6:53] Lord God can only give power to his sons
[6:56] who have come into adoption yes amen
[6:59] Hallelujah therefore you'll find a
[7:01] separating line now and we are not
[7:03] saying the ones without power are lost
[7:06] no because there's the gospel of
[7:09] salvation but then there's the gospel of
[7:11] Kingdom with Gospel of the Kingdom with
[7:13] power amen and that is for Sons not
[7:16] children the gospel of Salvation
[7:19] requires that you believe on the Lord
[7:20] Jesus Christ that's fine you believe on
[7:22] the Lord Jesus Christ for your salvation
[7:25] but I'm looking for more amen I'm
[7:28] looking to take back everything that was
[7:30] stolen from me you say was it stolen
[7:32] from you it was stolen from me in the
[7:34] Garden of Eden I have condemnation by
[7:37] representation I physically didn't sin
[7:39] in the Garden of Eden but because of
[7:41] representation I am associated with the
[7:44] fall in the
[7:46] beginning amen so the title deed that
[7:49] was taken back the title the holy spirit
[7:51] that was taken away from Adam amen
[7:54] hallelujah I want it back I want it back
[7:57] in its fullness because that's what
[7:59] Redemption means I hope some of you amen
[8:02] get like me and speak with authority and
[8:05] say what I
[8:06] want yes Lord amen we're coming to
[8:09] Father's house we must say what we want

[8:17] prodical son and ask for some portion of
[8:19] the inheritance I want my fullness of my
[8:21] inheritance I want the fullness of my
[8:23] Redemption amen amen amen amen so
[8:28] there's the gospel of salvation and
[8:30] those people won't be
[8:31] lost they'll even go through the
[8:33] tribulation and come out saved we're not
[8:36] saying they are lost we're saying
[8:38] there's a gospel of Salvation that
[8:40] requires believing in the Lord Jesus
[8:42] Christ but we are looking amen for the
[8:45] gospel of the Kingdom amen the gospel of

[35:29] 20 years ago I received it and accepted
[35:31] it if I hadn't the first sin I done God
[35:35] would have wipe me off the face of the
[35:36] Earth cuz he said he would and he has to

[35:47] yes now
[35:49] watch watch what he's saying now the
[35:52] only thing that kept me from being saved
[35:54] when I was 12 years old because a spirit

[36:01] me a devil saying wait a little
[36:06] longer what is stopping
[36:09] Destiny a spirit hanging over
[36:14] you that's the reason you wasn't saved
[36:17] when you become the age of
[36:21] accountability I'm challenging every one
[36:23] of you the reason you haven't progressed
[36:25] to your adoption is because there's a
[36:26] spirit hanging you you think Spirits
[36:28] want you to reach adoption no so they're
[36:31] going to do everything to stop you

[36:38] every week you can't come to church yeah
[36:41] it can't be every every service every
[36:43] this every second service every third
[36:45] there's a spirit hanging over
[36:49] you sons of God daughters love they
[36:52] can't wait for the door to be open yes
[36:55] that's a quote from the prophet
[36:57] praise the Lord there's a spirit hanging

[37:06] overed over you and kept hanging over

[37:15] man here that's got his right mind but
[37:17] what wants to do right but there's
[37:18] something won't let you do
[37:22] right that's the devil Christ paid your
[37:26] healing and salvation now here he is you
[37:29] get ready he commissioned his church to
[37:31] cast them Devils out
[37:35] amen now you know why you don't want to
[37:37] come to

[37:40] hanging over you don't want to be cast
[37:43] out there you are in my name they shall
[37:46] cast out Devils

[37:53] as we are progressing the Heavenly realm
[37:56] demon Spirits are cast out out here yes
[37:58] amen they go out but they come back with
[38:00] seven worst demons that's why the next
[38:02] service is so tough
[38:09] amen you ain't going to heal nobody
[38:12] because you're going but you're going to
[38:14] cast The Devil away from them so they
[38:16] can accept the healing that's already
[38:18] done amen you see what you're
[38:21] doing that's why I say Amen demon
[38:23] Spirits have attached themselves to your
[38:25] body illegally attach them El to
[38:27] people's body illegally so as sons of
[38:30] God we go to bind that spirit and cast
[38:32] that Spirit out so that the people can
[38:34] receive the healing that was paid for
[38:36] 2,000 years ago thank you Jesus but
[38:40] we've got to know our Authority yeah

[43:40] Lord so Angelic beings they had to call
[43:44] Michael the warrior
[43:46] angel Amen to get rid of that spirit so
[43:49] that Gabriel can come to the word to and
[43:52] bring a word to
[43:53] Daniel do you know the prophet couldn't
[43:56] pray for a baby
[43:57] because there was a spirit hanging over
[43:59] him yes
[44:01] amen he spoke a lie the spirit was
[44:04] hanging over him and he could not pray
[44:06] he had to go and confess that lie to the
[44:08] tax man why a spirit hanging
[44:14] around praise the Lord once he had it
[44:17] confessed the spirit left him and he
[44:19] could pray for the baby amen you see if
[44:24] you're reading between the lines you
[44:25] can't pray the spirit

[45:04] the Shak Glory but we've got no hidden
[45:06] [Music]
[45:09] life the secret is the hidden
[45:12] life because what you do in secret God
[45:15] will reward you openly the reason we
[45:17] can't see the glory of God in the church
[45:19] is because there's no secret
[45:23] life we like the idea of being in the
[45:26] message we like the idea that we have of
[45:28] the full revelation of the word but
[45:30] there is no secret
