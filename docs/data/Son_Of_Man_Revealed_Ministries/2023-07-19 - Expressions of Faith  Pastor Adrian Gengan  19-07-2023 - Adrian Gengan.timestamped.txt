[4:50] Faith praise and prayer we'll turn to
[4:53] Psalm 34 Verse 1.
[4:58] Psalms 34 and verse 1 says I will bless
[5:01] the Lord
[5:02] at all times
[5:06] I Will Bless The Lord sometimes

[5:48] bless his name amen one more scripture
[5:51] we'll go to Matthew 6 and 9. here the
[5:53] Lord is teaching us how to pray and
[5:55] you'll see if we mix our prayer with
[5:58] praise we can have more Dynamic results
[6:01] amen
[6:03] just gonna take the opening verse of
[6:05] that prayer
[6:06] Matthew 6 and 9.
[6:08] Our Father who shot in heaven and yet he
[6:12] starts to praise Hallowed be thy name
[6:14] amen you go straight into praise

[6:24] the reading of his word even as we hear
[6:26] the word faith cometh by the hearing of
[6:28] the word amen hallelujah amen so the
[6:31] expression how can we express our faith
[6:33] amen hallelujah
[6:36] so a Christian we know he's somebody who
[6:38] is glad who has joy of the Lord
[6:41] the joy of the Lord is our
[6:44] friend amen hallelujah so somebody who's
[6:47] always displaying joy of the Lord both

[7:35] us anxiety doesn't get us amen because
[7:37] of the faith that is within us

[7:45] life of prayer living a life of praise
[7:48] and worship to our God
[7:50] amen if you don't have joy then we

[15:02] praise
[15:04] amen you make your notion now you read
[15:07] 150 go quickly in 150 then you'll see
[15:09] amen if you don't know what to read
[15:12] during the week write down now Psalm 150

[15:19] Lord here amen amen praise the Lord
[15:22] all glory be to his name thank you Lord
[15:25] amen many many men
[15:28] amen prayer amen you know the Lord told
[15:32] him if my people were called by my name
[15:34] and we've been called by his name not
[15:36] only have we been called by his name but
[15:38] we have received the revelation of his
[15:40] name and we have the married name of the
[15:42] Lord Jesus Christ amen if we humble
[15:45] ourselves and pray did we humble
[15:47] ourselves this year and pray amen amen
[15:49] and he promised you would hear from
[15:51] Heaven amen you will heal our bodies he
[15:54] will heal our land he will heal all
[15:56] unbelief amen all Strife or worry or
[15:59] fear all anxiety amen
[16:01] you will hear from Heaven amen amen heal
[16:04] us amen praise be to God Amen Hallelujah
[16:08] but you know pray prayer has protocol
[16:12] pray you've got to go through channels
[16:15] amen
[16:17] hallelujah amen prayer Daniel Prayed one
[16:21] time
[16:22] and there was protocols
[16:24] amen and God was sending back the word
[16:27] back through Angels amen and sometimes
[16:29] prayer amen is not maybe the thing that
[16:32] you need
[16:33] because in the midst of great trial and
[16:36] Circumstance you need an immediate
[16:37] answer
[16:39] amen hallelujah amen so if you go to
[16:43] Ephesians 6 12 amen it tell you that how
[16:46] these demon powers were fighting the
[16:47] Prince of Persia
[16:49] amen 21 days Michael had to come and
[16:52] assist Gabriel
[16:54] he was going back to the Earth with the
[16:56] word because Daniel prays had gone up to
[16:59] the heavens on the first day and God
[17:01] heard his praise and God dispatched
[17:03] Gabriel to go and give him back the
[17:05] answer but there was resistance from The
[17:07] Prince of Persia
[17:09] amen so prayer has brought a call
[17:11] prayers can be hindered amen through
[17:13] there because of your unbelief because
[17:16] of your unforgiveness praise can be
[17:18] hindered
[17:20] and also because of obstruction from the
[17:22] Demonic realm you'll see and we wrestle
[17:24] not against flesh and blood but against
[17:26] principalities against Powers against
[17:29] rulers of Darkness of this world against
[17:31] spiritual wickedness in high places
[17:34] amen hallelujah
[17:37] so you find that if you read Daniel
[17:39] chapter Amen in Daniel you find that
[17:42] there was a delay in the response yes
[17:45] amen but that prayer was for revelation
[17:48] of the world
[17:50] but when you need Deliverance amen you
[17:52] turn on your praise
[17:54] you get on your pretty shoes you get on
[17:56] your dancing shoes amen hallelujah
[17:59] hallelujah there was other three boys
[18:01] there Amen in that Babylonian system
[18:04] amen
[18:05] Shadrach Meshach and abidny go amen and
[18:08] there was a threat upon their lives
[18:10] because they were following the word of
[18:12] God they were Resolute on the word of
[18:14] God and Exodus 20 verse 1 told them I am
[18:17] the Lord thy God which have brought thee
[18:19] out of the land of Egypt and out of the
[18:21] house of bondage thou shall have no
[18:23] other gods before me amen
[18:25] that shall not make unto thee any Graven
[18:28] image or any likeness of anything that
[18:30] is in heaven above or that is in Earth
[18:32] beneath or that is in the water under
[18:34] the Earth thou shall not bow thies down
[18:37] thyself to them nor serve them yes for
[18:41] us I the Lord thy God am a jealous God
[18:43] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[18:45] upon the children and to the third and
[18:48] fourth generation of them that hate me
[18:51] amen so these children of Israel were
[18:54] presented with an image of Daniel
[18:57] and they were asked to bow down before
[18:59] the prophet
[19:02] be spiritual now
[19:04] they were asked to bother him before the
[19:05] image of the Prophet amen hallelujah but
[19:09] here they were resoluting their faith
[19:11] amen and they said no we will not bow
[19:14] down King
[19:15] amen they refused to bow down and here
[19:18] you'll find it in Daniel chapter 3 amen
[19:21] we can go to Daniel chapter 3 quickly
[19:23] then amen
[19:25] so the king makes a decree amen that
[19:28] every time they hear the sounds of the
[19:30] music
[19:32] everyone must bow down so they had a
[19:34] practice run and everyone bowed down
[19:36] except three people
[19:41] you can pick this up in Revelation
[19:42] chapter 13.
[19:45] about people who refuse to Bow onto the
[19:48] image of the beast in this hour people
[19:50] whose names are found in the book amen
[19:52] the Bible says that the only ones who
[19:53] didn't bother and worship the image of
[19:55] the Beast are those whose names were
[19:57] written in the Lamb's Book of Life from
[19:59] before the foundation of the world and
[20:01] tonight I'm happy to tell you that I'm
[20:03] one of them are you one of them amen who
[20:05] will not bow down to the image
[20:07] amen amen hallelujah
[20:11] amen verse 13.
[20:14] here's the Beast now in his rage you
[20:16] know Revelation 13 and years in in verse
[20:19] 13 then Nebuchadnezzar and his rage and
[20:21] fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach
[20:23] and Abednego then they brought these men
[20:25] before the king
[20:27] Nebuchadnezzar says is it true Shadrach
[20:30] Meshach Abednego do you not serve my
[20:33] gods no worship the golden image which I
[20:35] have set up

[21:37] image you should not bow down that's how
[21:39] we are to stand on the word of God Amen
[21:42] I'm saying it again the prophet came to
[21:43] point us back to the word of God he's
[21:46] the revealer of the word of God amen

[22:38] able to Deliver Us From The Burning
[22:40] fiery furnace and he will deliver it
[22:42] Deliver us out of thine handle King

[22:48] be known as the deal King that we will
[22:50] not serve thy gods no worship the golden
[22:53] image which thou has set up amen
[22:56] so what do they do first they begin to
[22:58] praise God they're saying I was God whom
[23:00] we serve is able to Deliver Us From The
[23:03] Burning fiery furnace they are making
[23:05] their boasting God they are praising God
[23:08] yes our God is able amen so what do they
[23:11] do do they go on their knees and pray
[23:14] come on now

[23:36] unto deal King that we will not serve
[23:39] thy Gods nor worship the golden image

[23:46] amen
[23:50] and he commanded that they should heat
[23:52] up the furnace seven times hotter
[23:57] and that's the type of the seven Church
[23:59] age
[24:01] you don't believe me
[24:03] the type of the seven Church age
[24:06] all Hall is let loose upon the Earth
[24:09] amen the Bible says the writer on the
[24:10] horse
[24:11] is called death and Hell Followed him

[24:29] all around us yes people groping in
[24:31] darkness

[24:35] satisfaction in this life but they can
[24:36] find no satisfaction in his life
[24:39] amen you find people who have who have
[24:42] achieved our success in this life in
[24:44] terms of finances in terms of in terms
[24:46] of wealth in terms of in terms of maybe
[24:48] a home and a good job and a car amen
[24:51] they don't have peace here they go to
[24:53] alcohol they go to drugs they go to aim
[24:56] at smoking to addiction and all kinds of
[24:58] things they're going to they don't have
[25:00] peace
[25:01] because the only real peace you can find
[25:03] is in the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:06] the Bible says I will keep the imperfect
[25:08] peace whose mind is stayed on me
[25:12] you don't need to go to a psychologist
[25:15] if you have a troubled mind
[25:17] the Bible is the answer amen the word of
[25:20] God is the answer
[25:21] God said I will keep you in perfect
[25:23] peace whose mind is stayed on me so the
[25:26] person is going through anxiety through
[25:28] depression to problems in his life needs
[25:31] to get into the word of God needs to get
[25:33] all of the promises of God
[25:35] amen I need to start to believe those
[25:37] promises of God and need to confess it
[25:40] amen if you confess with your mouth and
[25:43] believe in your heart

[25:50] commanded amen now he commanded the most
[25:52] mighty men that were in the Army to bind

[26:01] then they bound these men in their
[26:03] quotes
[26:04] they're awesome they act and other
[26:07] garments and they were cast in the midst
[26:09] of the burning fiery furnace therefore
[26:12] because the king's commandment was
[26:13] urgent
[26:15] if the natural King's commandment was
[26:17] urgent how much more the King of Kings
[26:20] amen hallelujah and the fun is exceeding
[26:23] out the flames of fire slew those strong

[33:09] angel of the Lord was in the bush

[33:37] to find here
[33:39] they have three kings
[33:41] and the armies
[33:43] coming after Joseph Anthony's people
[33:48] amen we got First Kings chapter 20. amen
[33:52] he came to pass after this also it may
[33:55] be second Kings just check the equator
[33:57] it came to pass after this also that the
[33:59] children of Moab and the children of
[34:01] Ammon
[34:03] and with them beside the ammonites came
[34:05] again show us referred to battle
[34:07] so who is this three kings and the
[34:10] armies have formed one Army
[34:15] some of you got it
[34:18] three kings and their armies are formed
[34:20] into one powerful Army
[34:24] amen
[34:25] what is this the three horse riders
[34:28] merge together and become the Payless
[34:32] Rider the pay loss is a mixture of all
[34:34] three horse riders
[34:36] yes amen glory be to his name amen and
[34:40] here in verse so we find here
[34:43] that even though there's a merger of
[34:45] these three powers and the Payless right
[34:47] is going forth
[34:49] greater Is In Me Greater is he that is
[34:52] in me
[34:53] amen then the force Riders yes
[34:58] amen
[35:00] fear the Bible says and he set himself
[35:03] to seek the Lord he proclaimed of us
[35:05] through all of Judah watch now he uses
[35:07] prayer
[35:09] but prayer is going to give him the
[35:12] answer to the victory
[35:15] so he proclaimed the first throughout
[35:17] all Judah and Judah gathered together
[35:19] themselves
[35:22] amen you shouldn't find it it's the book
[35:25] of Kings chapter 20. amen Joseph had
[35:28] feared and sent himself to seek the Lord
[35:30] and Proclaim they fast toward all Judah

[35:34] or maybe sorry II Chronicles
[35:37] 20. second chronicles amen that's why
[35:40] you're not finding second chronicles 20.
[35:42] and Joseph had feared and set himself to
[35:45] seek the Lord and proclaim the first
[35:46] word all Judah and Judah gathered
[35:49] themselves together
[35:51] to ask help of the Lord even out of the
[35:54] cities of Judah
[35:55] so now they ask the Lord oh Lord God of
[35:57] our fathers other not God in heaven and
[36:00] rulers thou over the kingdoms of the
[36:01] Eden and in thine hand is not their
[36:03] power and might
[36:05] so that none is able to withstand thee
[36:08] other not our God
[36:10] you see how we need to pray
[36:13] are you not the god of William Branham
[36:17] who described the inhabitants out of
[36:19] this land before the people of Israel
[36:21] and gave it it to the Seed of Abraham

[36:49] and cry unto thee in our Affliction and
[36:52] thou will hear us and help us
[36:55] so you see how we can quote back the
[36:56] scripture to God
[36:59] that's why I say don't pray on prayers
[37:02] Jehoshaphat is taking a scripture amen
[37:04] and he's asking God back the scripture
[37:07] amen

[42:02] the next day of battle as soon as they
[42:04] are the word of God these people got to
[42:05] praise and they got a guitar amen they
[42:07] got a campfire going amen then you're
[42:09] preparing the song what songs are we
[42:11] gonna sing they had a band rehearsal
[42:13] amen
[42:17] they stood up to praise the Lord God of
[42:19] Israel with a loud voice on high and
[42:21] there they rose up early in the morning
[42:23] and went forth in the wilderness right
[42:27] now Joseph had the king comes and he
[42:29] says believe in the Lord your God so
[42:31] shall he be established believe His
[42:33] prophets so shall he Prosper amen
[42:37] and when you're consulted with the
[42:39] people he appointed singers unto the
[42:42] Lord amen
[42:43] Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory he didn't
[42:47] call the prayer warriors
[42:49] yeah
[42:50] come on now
[42:52] amen he didn't want his prayers to be
[42:55] hindered by demonic forces
[42:58] the Bible says that he inhabits the
[42:59] Praises of his people
[43:01] so they were going to turn on praise
[43:04] because they needed God to show up amen
[43:07] amen same like those three boys they
[43:09] didn't go on their knees and pray amen
[43:11] Daniel Prayed and you went to 21 days
[43:13] the three Hebrew boys turned on their
[43:15] praise and got the king of glory to come
[43:17] down amen

[43:23] so he says amen he appointed singers not
[43:26] the not the prayer warriors amen he
[43:28] didn't recall the prayer warriors he
[43:30] appointed singers unto the Lord now
[43:32] prayer has a purpose prayer has its
[43:34] place I'm teaching you in the time of
[43:36] emergency you need to turn on your
[43:37] praise
[43:38] let your prayer be accompanied with
[43:41] praise that's right we just showed you
[43:43] how Joseph had prayed before the Lord
[43:45] but prayer released the key to the
[43:47] victory
[43:49] the Lord told him your key is not
[43:51] through prayer only amen the key is to
[43:53] praise praise my name glorify me
[44:00] amen what do you think they were doing
[44:01] here he says praise that you should
[44:04] praise the beauty of his Holiness talk
[44:06] about the Lord
[44:08] I never lost my joy
[44:12] come on sing I never lost my praise
[44:18] amen hallelujah
[44:21] you don't lose your praise and they went
[44:23] out before the army
[44:25] unusual way to fight a battle you know
[44:28] what they put out in the front the
[44:30] footmen
[44:31] because they are dispensable
[44:36] they put the the new recruits out in the
[44:38] front
[44:40] they're dispensable
[44:42] because they're easy targets they put
[44:44] the stronger men in the back
[44:47] Hallelujah
[44:49] but yeah they put the praise
[44:51] they put their praise and worship
[44:53] singers that's why the praise and
[44:54] worship service goes before the
[44:55] preaching
[44:56] amen is to change the atmosphere amen
[45:01] bring the presence of God down yes amen
[45:04] hallelujah
[45:06] some of you wondering why are they
[45:08] telling me to sing
[45:10] you sing and you praise the name of
[45:11] Jesus
[45:12] you sing whether you like to or not you
[45:15] sing whether you feel like or not you've
[45:17] seen whether you're sick or not you
[45:19] glorify his name whether you want to or
[45:21] not
[45:23] amen they went out before the Army
[45:26] praised the Lord for his mercy and
[45:28] Jordan forever and they began to sing
[45:30] and praise and the Lord set ambushments
[45:33] against the children of Ammon Moab and
[45:36] Monsieur which came against Judah amen
[45:39] Hallelujah
[45:41] so they had three people here
[45:43] and God caused praise cause confusion in
[45:46] the enemy's camp
[45:49] he killed him
[45:53] well sorry those two got together and
[45:55] they killed him
[45:57] and then they turned against each other
[45:59] and they killed one another
[46:04] you're in 23. nice verses for the
[46:07] children of Amon and Moab stood up
[46:09] against the inhabitants of monsia
[46:11] utterly to slay them and Destroy them
[46:13] and when they had made an end of the
[46:15] inhabitants of seer
[46:17] everyone helped to destroy another
[46:21] you see what praise does it causes
[46:23] confusion
[46:26] you know why
[46:28] they don't know why you're praising
[46:32] they're confused
[46:34] they're seeing you sick in the bed with
[46:36] cancer but you're praising the law thank
[46:38] you Lord you healed me thank you Lord
[46:40] that by your wounds I am healed amen
[46:41] they're wondering what's Happening Here
[46:44] now they're attacking one another you're
[46:45] stupid I told you to possess him better
[46:50] amen
[46:52] praise the Lord
[46:56] praise the Lord amen so yeah they start
[46:58] to attack one another amen and you'll
[47:00] find you can read the rest of the story
[47:02] but you pick up here in verse 25 this is
[47:04] good I want to read this when Joseph had
[47:07] came this is one time the Lord allowed
[47:09] them to do this
[47:10] and these people came to take away the
[47:12] spoils of them they found amongst them
[47:15] an abundance both riches with the dead
[47:17] bodies and precious jewels which they
[47:19] stripped off for themselves more than
[47:22] they could carry away sure
[47:24] and they were three days in gathering of
[47:27] her spoil it was so much
[47:30] amen
[47:32] amen many many men
[47:34] Hallelujah
[47:36] you know why when Satan brings sickness
[47:38] on you and God heals you you can give
[47:40] you a new love
[47:41] give you a new heart yes yes amen he can
[47:44] give you a new organ yes it can fix you
[47:46] up better than you were before amen amen
[47:50] it was so much
[47:51] and they came to Jerusalem with
[47:54] Southeast UPS trumpets unto the house of
[47:57] the Lord and the fear of the Lord is
[47:58] upon the countries amen hallelujah one
[48:01] more example we're going to take now
[48:04] amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[48:07] amen so you see what praise can do
[48:11] amen praise can turn
[48:14] amen the situation around
[48:16] praise can turn it amen sorrow into Joy
[48:19] yes amen glory be to his name hallelujah
[48:23] praise the Lord so here was amen talking
[48:27] about Paul and silence now
[48:29] if we go to Philippians 4 and 4
[48:33] yeah the Apostle Paul is writing and he
[48:36] says rejoice in the lord always and
[48:39] again I say rejoice
[48:43] this was a man who rejoiced when he was
[48:45] in prison
[48:47] amen
[48:49] I think it's Acts chapter 16. they were
[48:51] in prison
[48:54] and the Bible says
[48:56] you know they threw them into jail they
[48:58] whooped them and they threw them into
[48:59] jail but the Bible says when the Trump
[49:01] turned midnight
[49:04] Paul and Silas began to praise the Lord
[49:07] amen these men were in prison they were
[49:10] beaten they had nothing to sing about
[49:11] they had nothing to reach
[49:15] but like we read in Psalm 149
[49:18] let them sing aloud on their beds they
[49:20] start to praise the Lord even though
[49:22] they were in prison facing death going
[49:24] through terrible torture in the prison
[49:26] yet they were filled with so much of
[49:28] praise and thanksgiving
[49:30] amen and like we were saying this is a
[49:32] secret to our victories amen
[49:35] amen
[49:36] secret to experience the victories of
[49:38] God in our life secret Amen to
[49:40] experience the joy and the strength of
[49:42] God this is the key to Rejoice the key
[49:45] to Rejoice Amen in knowing the knowledge
[49:47] of who God is in this hour amen knowing
[49:50] who is out delivering this hour amen
[49:52] that Jesus is with you that Jesus is not
[49:54] only with you but he dwells within you
[49:56] he said Lord I Am With You Always I've
[49:59] given you my Holy Spirit
[50:01] amen praise the Lord
[50:04] so we know that Joy comes with knowledge
[50:06] Joy comes as a result of the word of God
[50:08] knowing the end result before it is
[50:10] manifested produces Joy
[50:15] amen when your mind is fixed on God's
[50:18] promises it gives you Joy but Paul is
[50:21] saying don't look at your circumstances
[50:23] but look at what God is and he is with
[50:25] you and he is in you and therefore you
[50:28] can rejoice
[50:30] amen now you are able to unleash the
[50:34] greatest power in the universe
[50:37] amen by rejoicing and praising God
[50:41] but the devil occupies your time and he
[50:44] comes to trouble your mind with trials
[50:46] tribulations and your problems so when
[50:48] your mind is full of of Trials your mind
[50:50] is full of anxiety your mind is still of
[50:53] worry Satan can destroy your praise
[51:02] the enemy comes to kill stealer
[51:04] destroyed
[51:06] so he comes to fill your mind with
[51:08] anxiety comes to fill your mind with
[51:10] worry come to fill your mind with
[51:11] depression
[51:13] comes to feel it with all kinds of
[51:14] troubles amen trouble on all fronts
[51:17] remember these fronts are battlefields
[51:19] on the work front on the home front amen
[51:22] hallelujah sometimes on the church front
[51:24] these are battlefields amen
[51:28] amen hallelujah glory be to his name
[51:30] amen coming to destroy your praise but a
[51:34] person who is rejoicing he knows who he
[51:36] is in Christ
[51:38] the power that is backing him up is
[51:41] knowing amen that the victory was
[51:42] obtained on the cross of Calvary thank
[51:44] you oh brother why are you going back to
[51:46] the cross the cross is important the
[51:48] cross is our foundation the cross is our

[52:04] Perfection now we can live cleanse now
[52:06] we can live amen
[52:07] in all the benefits that Jesus died for
[52:10] us the moment we think amen that we can
[52:12] have our own righteousness the Bible
[52:14] says our righteousness is a truth he
[52:16] ranks if you are so righteous and so
[52:18] good about so good God would have put
[52:20] you on the cross
[52:23] but we couldn't do it so God sent his
[52:26] only begotten son amen that whosoever
[52:28] should believeth on it believe in him
[52:29] should not perish but have everlasting
[52:31] life amen
[52:33] amen amen so now we have a new life we
[52:36] have Victory because we are forgiven in
[52:38] him amen amen we have new life through
[52:40] the sacrifice of the Cross and the blood
[52:42] of Jesus Christ

[52:45] evidence
[52:49] through your problem
[52:50] to your situation
[52:52] even you can see no physical evidence of
[52:55] the victory your faith tells you through
[52:57] the word of God that you have the
[52:59] victory that's what real faith is you

[1:02:07] be fearful yeah in six and seven do not
[1:02:09] be fearful but in everything but prayer
[1:02:11] and supplication with Thanksgiving so
[1:02:14] he's mixing his prayer with praise
[1:02:16] amen but in everything now sometimes
[1:02:19] there's not everything he's not saying
[1:02:21] for everything give thanks
[1:02:24] because if you got cancer you can't give
[1:02:27] God thanks for cancer
[1:02:28] but he says in everything
[1:02:30] give thanks
[1:02:32] amen because God doesn't give you cancer
[1:02:34] Satan gave you cancer
[1:02:36] all right amen so in the midst of cancer
[1:02:39] in the midst of sickness in the midst of
[1:02:41] disease you can start to praise the Lord
[1:02:43] and give him Thanksgiving in everything
[1:02:45] because my God is greater than the
[1:02:47] sickness my God is greater than the
[1:02:49] circumstance my God is greater than my
[1:02:51] finances when you start to praising God
[1:02:54] you are actually turning your battle
[1:02:55] into the hand of God and you're saying
[1:02:57] Lord the battle is not mine I'm standing
[1:02:59] still and I'm waiting to see the
[1:03:01] salvation of the Lord I'm turning my
[1:03:03] problem to you Lord I'm treating my
[1:03:05] sorrow I'm trading my sickness and
[1:03:07] training my poverty I'm trading my
[1:03:10] circumstance I'm training my heart

[1:03:30] now living the second part of the
[1:03:31] scripture where Jesus stopped email
[1:03:34] could we desire 60 amen where you spoke
[1:03:36] amen he stopped in the middle of the
[1:03:38] scripture he says I've come to give you
[1:03:39] the oil amen instead of mourning amen
[1:03:42] beautiful ashes this is the hour this is
[1:03:44] the season amen and one of these days
[1:03:46] he's gonna trade this Mortal body for an
[1:03:49] immortal body it's not long from now
[1:03:51] amen it's any day now we are moving from
[1:03:54] Mark 11 23 to John 23 your brothers your
[1:03:58] sisters shall live again amen come on
[1:04:01] now amen we are moving from speaking to
[1:04:03] the mountain all the way to the
[1:04:05] resurrection of the dead from Mark 11 23
[1:04:08] all the way to John 11 23 amen we are in
[1:04:12] the midst of that right now we are in
[1:04:14] the midst of the progression of that and
[1:04:15] I'm telling you sons and daughters are
[1:04:17] rising now amen this is the hour when
[1:04:20] all creation is groaning waiting for the
[1:04:22] manifestation of the sons of God and by
[1:04:24] God's grace sons and daughters are
[1:04:26] rising up amen hallelujah we are not a
[1:04:29] defeated Army we are an invincible Army
[1:04:31] nothing shall be able to stand before
[1:04:33] all the Days of Our Lives you believe
[1:04:36] that amen hallelujah no situation can
[1:04:39] come before you Satan come to make you
[1:04:41] fearful but in every situation be
[1:04:44] prayerful and in all thank the Lord with
[1:04:46] supplication and Thanksgiving amen yes
[1:04:49] Hallelujah
[1:04:52] amen
[1:04:54] glory be to the Lord amen so don't focus
[1:04:56] on the circumstance focus on the word
[1:04:58] focus on the word speak the word amen
[1:05:01] God has given us freedom three son Jesus
[1:05:03] Christ amen it's a finished walk on the
[1:05:05] cross finish from sickness finish
[1:05:08] financial crisis finish amen he said it
[1:05:11] is finished so my confidence is in God
[1:05:13] and I trust him amen
[1:05:16] some of you need to say that
[1:05:18] you need to speak these words my
[1:05:20] confidence is in you Lord and I trust
[1:05:21] you that's right amen amen hallelujah
[1:05:25] I believe in much more than what my eyes
[1:05:27] are telling me yes I believe in much
[1:05:29] more than what I am hearing
[1:05:31] amen I believe in more than these five
[1:05:33] senses that's what faith is Faith denies
[1:05:36] the five senses yes yes
[1:05:39] so there's so much power in us that we
[1:05:42] can defeat Satan at his own game and
[1:05:44] turn it into a victory but the power
[1:05:46] needs to be unlocked
[1:05:49] and you know what
[1:05:50] God can't unlock it
[1:05:53] who unlocks praise
[1:05:56] you've got to unlock it
[1:05:59] God can't unlock it
[1:06:02] the only person who can unlock
[1:06:06] the power of speaking to the mountain is
[1:06:08] you
[1:06:09] know
[1:06:11] God installed it in us the power that
[1:06:14] switched the day we were born again
[1:06:19] but the only one that can turn on the
[1:06:20] switch and the power to defeat the enemy
[1:06:23] and unlock the victory is inside of us
[1:06:25] but we need to turn on the power amen
[1:06:27] amen hallelujah the victory is here for
[1:06:31] us to get amen I get answered prayers by
[1:06:34] turning on the praise I get answered
[1:06:36] prayers by turning on my prayers amen
[1:06:38] and you don't do it after you get the
[1:06:41] blessing you do it before you even see
[1:06:43] it before there's a sight of it before
[1:06:45] there's a sound of it yes I see the
[1:06:49] cloud the size of a man's hand
[1:06:52] but he declared it's gonna rain
[1:06:55] before you see one drop of rain you are
[1:06:58] speaking it amen that's what faith is
[1:07:00] all about the word of God is teaching us
[1:07:02] that we must give God praise on purpose
[1:07:05] have you ever heard people say that that
[1:07:08] person is purposefully picking on me
[1:07:12] how many of your children's dad he's
[1:07:15] doing it on purpose
[1:07:16] he's doing it on purpose
[1:07:19] you praise God on purpose amen amen
[1:07:22] praise God on purpose
[1:07:24] amen hallelujah so the person who
[1:07:27] understands that this power is laying
[1:07:28] within him
[1:07:29] purposefully give God's praise
[1:07:32] he's got a purpose for doing it and he's
[1:07:34] not doing it because he's trying to get
[1:07:37] something he's doing it out of
[1:07:38] relationship with God
[1:07:40] he's doing it because he Praises his God
[1:07:42] in every situation amen amen he's
[1:07:45] praising God in spite of the
[1:07:46] circumstance he may not feel like it but
[1:07:48] he continues to praise the Lord
[1:07:50] amen hallelujah strongholds are broken
[1:07:53] Victory is one if you understand the
[1:07:55] power of praise amen that you are
[1:07:57] unleashing by activating this power amen
[1:08:00] and when it's released from your mouth
[1:08:02] amen it goes into the spiritual realm
[1:08:04] and wherever demons have been trying to
[1:08:06] attack you those demons are attacked by
[1:08:08] the power of faith
[1:08:10] Faith coming out of your mouth Faith
[1:08:12] coming with understanding
[1:08:14] amen the Israelites knew about praise
[1:08:17] and pray in the temple only but God was
[1:08:19] showing them about praise and praying in
[1:08:21] the battle Yeah
[1:08:23] amen hallelujah because in the
[1:08:25] battlefield the praise is greater in the
[1:08:28] battlefield the prayer is greater more
[1:08:30] intense amen hallelujah
[1:08:34] so tonight if you're going through some
[1:08:36] fear some depression having suicidal
[1:08:39] thoughts fears anxiety financial crisis
[1:08:41] whatever you're going through God is
[1:08:43] much greater than the problem amen
[1:08:46] amen
[1:08:47] you've got to open up your mouth
[1:08:50] and give him praise
[1:08:51] because the word says don't be anxious
[1:08:53] about anything but in everything we pray
[1:08:56] and petition let your supplications be
[1:08:59] known to God with Thanksgiving
[1:09:01] I'm praising God because of my
[1:09:02] fellowship with him I'm praising God
[1:09:05] because of my relationship with him I'm
[1:09:07] praising God because I want to be
[1:09:08] connected with him
[1:09:10] amen I want to stay connected with him
[1:09:12] yes amen not after God moves on my
[1:09:15] behalf but before he can move I'm
[1:09:17] praising God amen amen amen I want to be
[1:09:21] in his presence I want to be connected
[1:09:23] to God I want to do what the Bible says
[1:09:25] amen you know what the Bible says
[1:09:29] the mountains melt like Wax at the
[1:09:32] presence of the law so stay in his
[1:09:35] presence the mountains will start to
[1:09:37] melt
[1:09:39] the mountains melt at the presence of
[1:09:42] the Lord so prayer is like a big gun of
[1:09:44] faith
[1:09:46] pray is like an ak-47. praise like an
[1:09:50] assault rifle automatic
[1:09:53] amen it unleashes wrath and fury
[1:09:58] sorry I'm talking about praise praise is
[1:10:00] like a big gun
[1:10:02] that unleashes wrath and fury upon
[1:10:04] Satan's kingdom
[1:10:05] Devastation man
[1:10:07] amen and you know what Atomic Warfare is
[1:10:10] right we told you that it's not saved
[1:10:11] the Lord the prophet says that saved the
[1:10:13] Lord Atomic Warfare unleashes
[1:10:17] amen so when you take the gun out the
[1:10:19] devil has to flee
[1:10:22] amen amen
[1:10:24] and don't stop firing
[1:10:26] you have unlimited supply of ammunition
[1:10:29] don't stop firing
[1:10:31] you say what's my ammunition my musician
[1:10:34] is my breath the Bible says let
[1:10:36] everything that had bread praise the
[1:10:37] Lord amen praise the Lord
[1:10:40] if you see somebody not praising now in
[1:10:42] the next few minutes I want you to go to
[1:10:44] them and say your oxygen Thief
[1:10:48] you're supposed to be praising the Lord
[1:10:49] with that breath amen turn on the praise
[1:10:52] amen tomorrow I want you to shock the
[1:10:55] family
[1:10:56] when you wake up in the morning
[1:10:58] if you're unemployed say think tell him
[1:11:00] you know what Dad Mom I thank the Lord
[1:11:02] that I'm employed
[1:11:04] amen the devil will start investigating
[1:11:08] this fella got to drop you
[1:11:10] why he's talking like this
[1:11:14] person saying they healed
[1:11:16] didn't I tell you to oppress them didn't
[1:11:19] you send reinforcements
[1:11:22] amen so take the gun out
[1:11:26] the gun of praise the god of Faith
[1:11:28] filled with faith don't stop firing on
[1:11:30] the enemy until that mountain is moved
[1:11:33] amen all these years he's been
[1:11:35] threatening you amen he's trying to be
[1:11:37] threatening you to free to the hills and
[1:11:39] the mountains amen but you are going to
[1:11:41] go and like Jesus curse the root of the
[1:11:43] problem you are going to the root of the
[1:11:45] problem
[1:11:46] amen amen hallelujah
[1:11:49] so you must trouble your trouble with
[1:11:51] the kind of faith
[1:11:52] you become troubled with the trouble
[1:11:55] because who's behind the trouble the
[1:11:57] enemy
[1:11:59] the devil wants you
[1:12:00] to keep you from praise and thanksgiving
[1:12:02] but whilst we are in the process of
[1:12:05] believing the devil knows how important
[1:12:07] it is for you to maintain your positive
[1:12:10] confession of faith
[1:12:12] so what he's doing trying to destabilize
[1:12:14] you the promises of God that you're
[1:12:17] believing in the word Satan is going to
[1:12:18] try and come and put as much pressure on
[1:12:20] you
[1:12:22] thinking that and put fear on you
[1:12:24] because you want you to disbelieve that
[1:12:26] word
[1:12:27] that's how he works through doubt and
[1:12:29] reasoning fear
[1:12:30] amen so don't stop firing the key is
[1:12:34] praise the key is prayer start to use
[1:12:36] these expressions of our faith
[1:12:39] amen and it will unlock every prison
[1:12:42] door every bondage amen when we
[1:12:45] understand the power of the expressions
[1:12:47] of our faith amen glory be to his name
