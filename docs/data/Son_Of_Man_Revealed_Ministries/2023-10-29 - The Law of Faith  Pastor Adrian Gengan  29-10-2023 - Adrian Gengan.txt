For Your Glory and for your honor in Jesus name amen amen amen amen amen good morning amen greetings in the name of of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen he's worthy to be praised amen let's give the Lord a good handup of Praise am amen hallelujah praise the Lord see some people matching me waiting through here very good amen we all got the memo praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen so don't forget the evening service amen at uh the Devin girl Secondary School amen at 400 p.m. hallelujah amen you're looking forward to a blessed time blessed day in the house of the Lord amen good to see sister jenzo you here back amen hallelujah pray the Lord will bless you amen hallelujah amen God bless you amen let's turn to the Bible Romans chapter 3 Romans chapter 3 amen praise the lord we can read from verse 21 but I'll focus on verse 27 but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus amen whom God had set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time is righteousness that he might be just and the justify of him which believeth in Jesus now you can see that scripture is packed so many things we are finding in Jesus there amen you're finding righteousness in Jesus amen you're finding that you are Justified you are redeemed through Jesus amen hallelujah amen we have remissions of sin through Jesus amen we are justified through Jesus then it comes through verse 7 27 where is the boasting then it is excluded yes by what law of works so that there's two laws now is it the law of Works how many of us receive this by works no but by the law of Faith am amen the Lord had blessings with reading of his word amen you may be seated for title will speak on the law of Faith this morning amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen that should excite us because amen a law is a universal principle amen so why I'm saying it should excite us because anyone operating under the law can operate by faith amen if we can tap into the law yes anyone who applies it amen can have faith amen so it's not for Selected Few people amen hallelujah young and old can have faith am rich and poor can have faith amen whether you have a position in the church or you don't you can have faith amen hallelujah amen amen when God looks at us he looks at us Through The Eyes of Faith he looks at us in our ought to be condition amen so we praise the Lord for that amen hallelujah amen so the principle of Faith are based on spiritual laws now on the earth they are natural laws and who set these laws into motion is God Almighty amen Hallelujah when God created the heavens and the Earth he set laws into motion amen amen and man through time has stepped into God's laboratory and they began to discover these laws and then they start to work with these laws and by working these laws they are able to achieve many things in this life and they've gone through many revolutions you know that amen hallelujah you know brother the r and all of these things because they were working with laws and now you find one of the final things that they've tapped into is that fourth dimension the fourth dimension was God's Communication channel With His prophets they could see Visions amen they could see a far off amen hallelujah but then science stepped into God's laboratory and God allowed it that way amen so that through this fourth dimension is coming now amen the word of God but the is also not demon powers influencing bya this fourth dimension and coming through ether waves through your homes amen through your Wi-Fi signals all of it amen two Avenues one coming down from heaven and one coming from the pit of Hell right amen hallelujah so these are spiritual principle of faith is based on spiritual laws they work for whosoever will apply these laws and you can set them in motion amen how do we set the law of Faith In Motion [Music] amen how do we set the law of Faith In Motion by the spoken word amen amen the law of faith is set in motion by your mouth amen amen that's why it says let everything that add breath praise the Lord not let everybody everyone who wants to praise the Lord begin to imagine it just say it in your heart just think and rejoice inside and say I just want to contain this no let everything that has bre praise the Lord amen you wake up in the morning and the birds are praising the Lord amen hallelujah amen yes amen animal life is teeming in the morning J do amen hallelujah they are all operating amen worshiping God Amen some of us we wake up in the morning we got no life we feel more tired amen amen hallelujah but we ought to Spring forth into life the first thing in the beginning God think on God think on the scriptures amen hallelujah begin to activate the spirit man within you Amen Hallelujah Lord amen amen just begin to say something Amen to praise the name of Jesus Amen at it with your mouth let it be the first thing you say let it be the last thing you do in night at night thank you Jesus Jesus yes amen amen what are you doing activating spiritual laws amen hallelujah we are having a church Quake amen what you begin to do amen you begin to Rattle Satan's kingdom every time you praise the Lord you rattle Satan's kingdom amenah amen yes so we set it in motion by our law the mouth by our mouths amen hallelujah yes amen now I want you to know the message of the hour has come to Us free yes amen we don't have to be bound that's right we don't have to be defeated amen amen hallelujah yes Lord we can praise the Lord anyhow amen whether we feel like or not amen amen turn to your brother and say come on join me praise the Lord say join me join me amen hallelujah tell him I want to hear you say amen hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Jesus so we know that in the natural law is rule with the authority of government behind it amen so we're talking about spiritual laws so the Kingdom of Heaven is behind God's spiritual laws amen and you don't dare violate it you work with God's laws amen you know with natural laws if you violate a law you can cause serious damage you can also end your life amen it carries clear consequences to anyone who violates it so a principle is a belief that God's Behavior amen but that only has a moral Authority behind it I'm talking about the natural laws they set these laws in motion on the earth governments put laws into place to gu to guide our moral Behavior yes amen but we're talking about the principles of faith and based on spiritual laws they are natural laws spiritual laws amen so we know that a law is something that has been tried and proved and whosoever gets involved amen anyone who gets involved the result will be the same amen you can try the law here in Durban you can try it in the USA you can try it around the world yes it must work the same amen so that means that the faith law there's no discrimination yes it doesn't work with any particular uh race group or particular language group amen it's a universally applied law yes amen the result will be the same amen so in faith there's no discrimination amen so the question is are we activating the law of faith in our lives are we living by faith amen amen because it's so easy to speak the negative it's so easy to speak in the flesh yes sometimes we forget about it sometimes we forget what we are taught but these things we need to reprogram ourselves amen amen sometimes you just need to do a good research amen and forget the old ways and just start to say Amen in school they didn't teach me about myself properly they taught me to rely on the five senses amen but here in church I'm hearing that I'm a spirit being amen amen amen amen and I ought to rule from the spirit man amen amen now we know there's a natural law called gravity amen I'm trying to show you here now that two laws can't be work at once and that one law can be more powerful than the other law so we know that the law of gravity pulls everything down but then there's another law called The Law of thrust so we know that a plane how does a plane defy one law by applying a more powerful law so on a Runway This Plane starts to take off with high speed thrust is built pressure is built on the Wings amen and it makes it Fly what's happening it's operating amen and it goes through the air and it's actually flying and it's using the air something we can't even see you can't see it but those wings are relying on the air amen hallelujah people wondering how we operating how we are functioning amen because faith is not something you can see yes amen amen amen hallelujah how come you are so joyful in the midst of uh economic depression how come you are so joyful Amen in the midst of trials in the midst of sickness in the midst of circumstances amen because the joy of the Lord is my strength I don't rely a natural circumstances to bring joy amen hallelujah whether the situation is good or bad I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God I've learn to to say praise the Lord anyhow amen hallelujah amen and the law of gravity sometime he trying to pull you down but you need to use a law of thrust yes amen hallelujah what does the law of thrust to now and the gets the engines going in the plane it starts to create its own storm starts to create its own winds in the air to start to give it a lift amen amen so what is it doing it's creating a storm on purpose sometimes we need to create an internal storm yes yes amen too slack too lazy we need to create an internal storm to be able to SW amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so what happens here this plane that's operating now must gather speed it must gather speed and as it starts to approach amen the of that Runway the pilot must lift and that plane when it lifts it lifts the cargo it lifts the passengers it lifts the weight of the plane it lifts everything amen could be thousands of tons in the in the plane amen but H Allelujah you can't play with the law yeah the law must work for you amen amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord so imagine the brings it now on the on the runway there and he's try is's activating the law of lift amen he's going to have to maintain a certain speed you can't be cruising there and thinking suddenly you're going to pull up nothing's going to happen amen so when we approaching now rapturing faet to leave this Dimension at what speed at what altitude ought we to be flying amen amen hallelujah did you hear what I said yes you some of you have not been on an airplane I need to take you brother Joshua that gForce when they take off yeah amen hallelujah they've got to maintain a certain speed in order to reach lift off amen sometimes amen we are too Earthbound in life because we are maintaining a cruise mode just cruising out you know you know when they're backing out to get onto the runway it's Cruise mode they just like cruising until they get onto the runway yeah amen and when they about to take place or when they about to take off everyone must be seated yeah you must be buckled up what is that I'm trying to tie that now with a cargo in that container everything must be tightly buckled down nobody's standing everybody seated seat belt in place M amen cell phone put on airplane mode yeah and some people are really nervous Flyers amen hallelujah the plane is getting ready to take off we are getting ready to change Dimensions amen hallelujah I want you to know that the plane is already going because the shout has already come yes the plane has got to maintain a certain speed we can't slow down because of unbelief we've got to maintain the speed am amen because we want lift up amen yes Lord am amen we will not slow down for anybody if you want you can catch up but we will not slow down yes amen hallelujah give God praise amen yes Lord hallelujah that's right amen amen amen hallelujah Lord amen we got to reach amen hallelujah defy the law of gravity and move I don't know 35,000 ft 38,000 ft whatever it is praise God we are soaring the heavenlies amen amen other birds may try and follow us amen hallelujah but they'll disintegrate amen other people may try to impersonate but they will disintegrate because they are not built for the laws up there Hallelujah they are not built to reach out to choth that we can go to amen but this is the age of the Flying Eagle we've been built for this time we've been built for the season amen spread your wings and fly yes Lord God thank you Lord amen praise the Lord yes amen as much as there's a law of Faith there's a law of fear as well people have fear sitting in the airplane oh some people they close their eyes and they hold on for dear life amen there's fear there's a lot of fear in life there's a lot of sicknesses come to bring fear in our lives lot of situations come to bring fear let the bank balance run a bit low you get fearful amen what am I going to do amen we what we need to do is not run to the lone Shar we need to run to the word of God yes amen I say Lord I'm operating a spiritual law right now you said if you clothe the lily of the field and if you can feed The Sparrows I am created in your image and your likeness I'm a son and daughter of god father I'm putting in a claim right now he said you'll never suffer your amen the righteous to be forsaken neither will they beg for bre yes amen I'm applying a spiritual law run to the word the word is our shelter amen open up the law of Faith amen thank you Lord I know we take comfort in one another sometimes amen we don't want to operate by the law of Faith because we can rely on one another that's good amen but we need to get our faith in God because there coming a Time amen where you may not get access to your brother you may not get access to your sister amen that time you can't look to the left or the right the only thing you can do is look up am amen now because the pilot is so experienced amen he deliberately accelerates moves with speed he's not double minded the the Bible says be single minded be sure of what you're doing you made a decision to serve the Lord be sure and go all in hold nothing back amen Hallelujah don't say and when I am up I am up when I'm down I'm down when I'm only halfway up I'm neither up nor down don't be that way flying midair you know if you're bumping into chickens you're flying too low you're probably not flying at all because chickens can't fly right you in the barard amen you in the barnyard still yes amen if you're meeting other birds of prey up there you're still flying too low because the eagle is the highest flying bird amen you ought to be bumping the only thing you ought to be bumping to his angels amen hallelujah am yes be like Israel amen Angelic visitation yes Hallelujah Angels ascending and descending amen amen amen and that's where we ought to be 11:23 our association with the Unseen World amen bumping into Angels amen amen amen hallelujah amen one of these days God is going to say you're flying so high I might as well just make you switch Dimensions amen amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord now we use the same law in our life because we have to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ am Amen to overcome the law of sin we must activate the law of faith and we've got to keep amen maintaining the law of Faith to overcome the law of sin amen amen accelerate the law of Christ amen hallelujah now Jesus teaches us the the Apostle Paul is teaching us here in Romans chapter 10 how to maintain the law of Faith how to how we activate the law how we activate the spiritual law and what does it say in Romans chapter 10:8 amen praise the Lord [Music] amen the word is not near you even in thy mouth amen the word is near you in your mouth amen oh if you go and read Joshua what did the Lord tell Joshua you must have the word in your mouth amen amen praise the Lord the word is n thee even in thy mouth amen [Music] hallelujah so in order for my engines to keep firing I need to have the word of God yes amen amen I got to keep firing the engines yes I can't allow the engines to switch off midair I've got to keep firing the engines I've got to have The Life of Christ in me amen hallelujah amen amen now is is the Apostle Paul telling us my problems are near me my problems are near me no what did he say the word is near you amen but sometimes all we find is the doctor's report near us the symptoms near us amen sometimes the cares of the life are near us so what we got to do we got to start to activate the spiritual law now start to pull down the word of God is n thee even in thy mouth amen you're feeling weak say Lord I thank you Father yes that in my weakness your strength is made perfect amen I thank you Lord that I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength start to activate the law amen praise the Lord don't ever say I'm feeling so down out amen be up and about it amen start to confess the word of the Lord just start to sing and start to change the atmosphere at home amen you know about atmospheres you remember what the prophet of God told us this woman had a drunk harassment amen hallelujah he was an addict and he came home with his friends and they were drinking in the bar and he says if you're really want to see a true Christian yes you come home with me and he took them home and yeah he started to a man probably act more drunk than he was and he told his wife fix me something to eat and then she goes to fix up some eggs and some ham amen and she fixes it she brings it to the him and his friends and he says watch us now he takes the eggs and the ham and he throws it and he says you know I don't like it this way amen praise the Lord amen the wife now knows she's in a test yes amen amen there's a difference between a Temptation and a test the Temptation is to make you fall but a test is for you to overcome amen a test is there for you to pass a test is here for you to Excel for you to graduate how Sister Janice come Lord I don't know how you say it right top of your class excellent marks amen 99.9% and your parents will ask you where is the point 1% but it's meant to make you Excel that's what a test is yes but sometimes we don't like the test Abraham was put to a test not a Temptation amen God was going to finally amen that was God taking his hand up on the mountain to say this is my beloved Son in whom I well pleased but he had to pass the test amen amen you know that's something there maybe I should drop this in here sometimes it's hard for fathers to compliment their sons to say son well done I'm proud of you learn from heavenly father he took Jesus up on the mountain and before for the witnesses he said this is my beloved Son amen amen yes hello amen do we learn from the Lord amen he took him up on the mountain amen didn't the voice also come at the River Jordan there amen hallelujah [Music] amen there's something about acceptance and hearing from your father you've got to have the confidence of your father Yes yes the reassuring voice of your father that lo I Am With You Always even if you fall down I'm there to pick you up I'm there to help you along life's journey amen amen amen praise the Lord amen so no matter what is around us keep the word of God near our mouth and in our heart so when does it say that now in our mouth only even in thy mouth and in thy heart what is that the word of faith which we preach amen amen amen amen because the word of faith will help you to overcome any sickness any disease any situation in life so the question is do I use the word of God in my mouth in my heart and keep firing and believing yes amen amen so it's not enough to be a good Catholic and only repeat the word yeah and think just by repeating the word and what they have this rosary right they say I'll keep repeating this word just repeating the word will not work you've got to believe the words coming out of your [Music] mouth amen believing switches it up amen confessing is one part believing switches it up amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord so it's not enough to only speak the word it's more about believing when you're believing you're firing that engine and somebody comes to you and speaks the opposite of what you are saying amen focusing on the symptoms you're not going to change your words to agree with them you're going to keep firing the word of God by the stripes of Jesus I am healed I don't care what you're saying amen hallelujah amen Lord amen amen keep firing the words of Faith amen the more negative reports you hear say thank you Jesus amen I'm believing the positive confession of my faith I believe I'm coming out of the circumstances and I'm not coming out of your wounded I'm not coming out of here dragging myself I'm coming out of the situation Victorious amen amen yes Lord thank you amen praise the Lord amen you know we ought to be making the devil's life from a living l a mystery amen amen the Lord's been working in some Supernatural way amen and I was just telling my wife amen hallelujah the devil better get his hands off our family and get his hands of Zion otherwise we're going to cause more Devastation and Chaos in his kingdom yes amen amen yes Lord amen amen amen amen hallelujah amen maybe I'll go to my testimony they put up that first slide there with the brother there so this is amen maybe I'll put in my testimonies in here so this is the healing ofo on the 18th of September we outside the Phoenix Plaza this young man is walking down from the clinic he's just there at the clinic and he comes and he stands there next to me he's just quiet you can see he's very feeble weak and he stands there and after I finish speak to somebody I turn to him and I start to speak to him and he tells me you can hear he's battling to breathe now he's battling to talk because of his lungs and he tells me he's just come from the doctor he checks out his tablets and he shows me and he tells me the doctor says my lungs are finished I've got to take like eight tablets a day and he says I'm battling to sleep at night I don't know what to do I can't even sleep if it matters to you this man is a homeless man he sleeps in the park there but God is no respector of persons amen amen amen now if you're interested I've got the entire thing on video this is just a screenshot the prayer that I'm praying for him is on video for somehow the Lord that is the only video we have for somehow the Lord allowed that to happen happen amen the prayer so you can hear the words that are praying and I'm telling him before I pray I said you believe God can give you a new lungs amen amen you remember we were preaching on that yes now God doesn't prepare you for something without putting you through it we've been through it in the church we taken you through all the quotes but here now God presents you with the situation amen what are you going to do yes amen so you can hear me saying in the video there if you believe God can give you new lungs and then I told him repeat after me and we sprayed the prayer of faith and I told him tonight you're going to sleep like a baby amen if you can believe so this man is down and out he got no but he's a very brilliant man you can see he's fluent in his English and things he maybe taken a wrong turn in his life and he ended up on the streets there but he speaks very well amen so that was the last saw him cuz he went away and then last Saturday we were out there there at the next picture we were out near check saave you know where check saave is there different location and we were busy over there now this is the man same man but you can see he looks different this is like a month later so we're busy over there and I see him running towards me and he grabs my hand and he says it worked it worked amen amen amen yes Lord amen hallelujah thank you Jesus now remember he's homeless I don't have a cell phone to keep encourag him so I took him on I said tell me what your testimony he says he went back home that night amen thank you Lord he went back home that night and he said Lord I don't know who that man is but he began to teach me your word and he told me if I can have faith to believe amen that you are able to heal my lungs amen he said Lord I don't these are words now he said Lord I don't want to put you through a test but if that was really you won't you come and touch me you see the prophet says sometimes in a prayer line because of his Divine gift the Christian he says a Christian woman or a man can pass through the prayer line and they never have faith they think they have faith but what they have is an intellectual conception of Faith he says but yeah maybe a woman of the street will come she's got nothing else she can only hold on to faith and he says There She Goes by receiving it yes amen amen am amen so I never saw him for a month he comes and he telling me it's worked it worked he tells me he went home and he prayed and he told the Lord if it's you he's saying the next thing he knew he woke up in the morning and he slept like a baby give the Lord a then I asked him what about the tablet he's saying I never had to take another tablet praise the Lord praise the Lord now I'm asking you did God give him new lungs yes amen yes Lord who is able to do this amen he is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think amen if thou can believe all things are possible amen amen thank you God will vindicate what we are preaching amen yes God will back it up yes amen and if the people that's in the confines of the message will not accept it and believe it God will find people that he needs to minister to amen but you got to know what you're talking about you got to have something to give amen I'm asking you how is your drink offering being poured out yes it's not for you to keep taking in how is your drink offering being poured out yes Peter and John there you know they in Acts chapter 3 what do they say such as I have give I unto thee you must have something to give it out I don't believe God is prepping Us in this place and this time and season for us to keep it for ourselves because you know your needs are really limited amen don't keep it when you get really old and you're sick then you want to pull out your faith eternal life is living for others yes yes amen let's go to the first slide that when to get the quote in amen cuz I want to remind you this we got to come back to the sincerity of the word amen right and believe that God can vindicate himself not vindicating me now this is Glory goes to God if I could heal anyone I I definitely would heal them I can't heal anybody amen all I can do is activate your faith but you know the prophet says you've got to have confidence in the man preaching he says if you don't have confidence in the man preaching God won't be able to do anything for you because God uses man that's his Avenue okay next one you see sincerity and sacredness now I'm I'm putting this again here for a reason five good people really filled with the spirit will do more in Phoenix amen amen than all the members we got if you're consecrated to God in a sincere life amen amen praise the Lord read that aloud brother rames read that again that's where sincerity and in sacredness five good people really filled with the spirit will do more in Phoenix than all the members we've got if they are consecrated to God in a sincere life the first five ANS let me see them amen amen I'm in that number amen yes amen you see sister Michelle sitting here with her kids you know why she's here ask her she received the track from Autumn am I right last week it reminded her of the assembly thank you Lord I didn't even know I never saw her but I believe she told my wife after the service she showed her the book and said I got it from Autumn yesterday praise the Lord now what is that it's God waiting there to be able maybe we never got a single other person to come but yes s to Michelle with the children let's give the Lord a good an of praise I believe God is going to give something good there amen amen I was telling you about this woman and the eggs she went to prepare the eggs again and she went back to her husband to give it to him why she knew something about atmosphere she knew something about her life lived yes she knew not to stoop down to that level but to live the life of Christ what happened when the friends saw this woman singing must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free he says no there's a cross for you there's a cross for me amen amen those three men got on the floor crying weeping they said we want this God that you serve amen hallelujah amen we want this God you serve oh yes SL probably some other woman would have grabbed him by his hair and told him not eat from the floor there hey no the life of Jesus Christ amen being lived amen praise the [Music] Lord so faith is the one will liftt you up when you are down when you're praying and praying and praying within and and you're praying and trusting God don't have anxiety when you praying you can't mix these two laws together the law of fear and faith you can't mix anxiety and I also want to tell you you can't stop thoughts from coming into your head but remember remember that's Satan's playground don't think you are defeated just because thoughts are coming in your head the prophet says don't let the thoughts settle yes keep the word of God in your heart the word in your mouth the word is neither even in thy mouth and in thy heart amen keep the word there amen amen you can know the word up here but that doesn't affect anything the spiritual law is applied when you keep it CH amen and you Holding On by faith amen hallelujah so when you when you start to learn the spiritual law and how it operates now you can say I'm ready for liftoff my engines are firing amen you're speaking the word with boldness you're speaking the word with confidence without wavering without doubting now you know your flight is sure to take off am amen now brother Cale probably can teach you that if you don't study a certain law it can cost you your life if he didn't study the laws surrounding electricity ask him how dangerous it is to touch a live wire amen so you got to be able to study the law first yes amen learn how it operates amen otherwise if you don't know how to handle it it will cause great damage yes demons will start to make you run amen you'll get an electric shock but when you're operating on the law of Faith amen you can't for a moment stop because the law of faith is active amen amen it's an active Force the Holy Ghost is an active Force yes it's a pulsation in our souls amen you you you're are beside yourself amen you're constantly living in this world of perfect Faith you can't stop thinking about the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen can I get a witness here you can't stop thinking about the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah amen you become a fanatic you become thinking hey maybe something has gone wrong with me amen hallelujah amen so we here we have good people in Phoenix that's consecrated to God in a sincere life amen hallelujah [Music] amen so don't just repeat the word here now what I'm saying to you how is the spiritual law activated this is a very important concept now because when you reading Hebrews 11 then it tell tells you Faith cometh by the hearing and hearing of the word of God you ever understand how that works faith comes by hearing hearing by the word amen so not necessarily you hear something 100 times that faith comes I'll take the slow now where is is the word in your mouth and so the word in your heart faith comes by the hearing that's one hearing and hearing by the word what happens the word speaks back to you yes amen the word speaks back to you amen when that word is speaking back to you now you're not taking the Faith from the outside yes you're taking the Faith from the inside amen amen give God praise for that amen hallelujah amen amen hallelujah so now what is happening I'm speaking words and receiving not from your external years only but faith is coming from the from an understanding that's what I'm saying it's coming from an understanding what is that it's a revelation and it's not Faith a revelation the word is speaking back the revelation of the truth to you faith is a revelation speaking words from the internal path the scripture is talking to
