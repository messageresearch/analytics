yeah but when you're walking down the street wherever you are you that profess to be Believers and fear the lord remember the angels of God are moving with you wherever you are oh thank you Lord they watch everything you do yes every thought that goes through your mind and they know all about you amen therefore we must be conscious of that amen he said if you're not conscious of it then you act anyway yes so people mostly today too many people are not conscious of the presence of the Lord Jesus that's the reason we have these things that we have going on now that's not right yes if he could only do like David said yes I put the lord always before me amen amen oh I like that the Lord is always before me where he goes i' follow and I'm and I'm conscious that everywhere I'm going other words David said that the Lord is going before me amen what Jesus said I will not leave thee nor forsake Thee thank you Lord said Jesus lo I Am With You Always even to the end of the world he cannot leave us he promised than not to amen what a promise hallelujah amen what an assurance we have as Believers amen we have this Blessed assurance that every way he goes the Lord goes before us the angels are set before us yes he said he will never leave us nor forsake us you might be going to that trial you might be going to that disastrous time you might be going to that cality and you're wondering that you're thinking that you are alone but you are not alone he said he will never leave you nor forsake you amen he knows everything that you go through he knows every circumstance you face amen amen oh wonderful thank you Lord amen you got your Bibles we'll turn to the book of Isaiah 55:6 amen I greet you all in the precious name of our our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen we all glad to be found in his presence this morning amen there's no other place that we rather be but in his presence amen so let's turn to the book of Isaiah chapter 55 reading from verse 6 amen you happy with what the Lord is doing so far amen amen amen the way is taking us from from Glory unto Glory amen amen and is showing us his plan he's unfolding his plan as it goes by and we are part of and he's showing us that we are part of the plan and we playing out our part in his plan absolutely amen so as you can see the gospel has become more practical yes in recent times it's become more putting it to you and showing you all now it's in operation right now amen we add it in theory all the time but now under the dynamic amen become a practical gospel that's what you've been listening to week after week the gospel has become more practical amen amen so you're not just becoming heers anymore you're becoming doers of Lord amen and you're not reading the testimony you are becoming the tesy hallelujah amen so Isaiah 556 say Seek the Lord while he may be found yes amen call ye upon while he is near amen amen because he coming an hour amen we may not even be able to be gathered here yes there's becoming a time while you might not be preached this gospel am everything that's being preaches now yes is being imparted into you yes and you are digesting it and becoming one with that word amen amen but there coming a time where you won't be able to see this Gathering he said let the wicked forsake his ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord yes Lord amen so he's saying we must forsake our own ways forsake our own thoughts amen return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God he will abundantly a pardon Lord thank you Jes no matter what how much down you went in the pits he will abundantly pardon you pardon you amen amen for my thoughts are not your thoughts yes neither are your ways my ways say the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the Earth's so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts amen for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return turn it not tther but water the Earth and maketh it bring forth and BD that it may give seed to the sow and bread to the eater yes so shall my word hallelujah be that go forth out of my mouth Yes amen it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please amen and it shall prosper yes in the thing where to I sent it oh yes Lord for y shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the Y shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their end instead of the thorn shall come up the F tree now I want you to look at this he's speaking to the Natural Israel but remember the spiritually he's speaking to us amen and instead of the Briar shall come up the mle tree and it shall be to the Lord for in name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off amen amen also you may you may SE that but we also turn to the Book of Revelation 41 Revelation 41 John is saying and after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be here after so John is called to come up higher amen yes we speaking this morning on a topic living in the realm of his glory amen amen hallelujah and don't you believe this is the hour yes where we are living in the realm of his glory glory amen maybe we lived in the realm of our own thoughts we've been living in the realm of our caral thinking we've been living too much in this Earthly realm amen but now that the mind of Christ come down yes maybe God could have wied you in other ages but in the age of adoption when the mind of when The Headstone has come down amen and the body fly framed together from the four corners of the Earth from every nation tribe tongue and Kindred amen that his body is brought this mystical body brought together not the works of man yeah not made by Hands by man's handen but made by the hand of God amen amen this body being now fly framed together he coming together and the mind of Christ come down to her yes amen she's now forsaking her own thoughts amen this body is now forsaking own thinking yes this body might have looked at things to time but when God looks at us he looks at us through eternity amen amen he doesn't look at us just in the time element that we're living in now amen he looked at you completely through all eternity he doesn't only look at you going now getting ready for the Rapture he looks at you living in the ions of time amen from all eternity all the way that you come from his mind amen and the fact that we come from him we an attribute of him yes amen amen and therefore when we when you get this now you are now able to come and live in the realm of his glory amen because God will show share his glory with no man yes amen remember this one thing God will share his glory with no man yes amen for God to share his glory it means that you part of him you an attribute of God you are not separated from God you are the part of God the feminist part of God you are not sep you understand you are one with him that's why he said I share my glory with no man you're not just a normal person you are an attribute of God therefore now you can live in the realm of his glory amen John 17:9 it says I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are dine and all mine are dine and dine are mine and I am glorified in them yes amen amen and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world see here to go up higher amen and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name Those whom thou has given me that they may be one amen as we are yes now for us to live in his glory we have to come up a bit higher amen amen that's why John was called up to come up higher yes he said John you are past all these ages Church ages now now it's time for you to come up higher amen if you if you want to experience for us to now have the same glor to experience the glory of God this the the way that go God worked when he was on Earth we have to come up higher amen we cannot live in the realm of this world am because when Jesus was on this Earth he walked in perfect Faith because he knew who he was he knew what the scripture said about him he knew what the word said about him he knew who he is in the word and he could walk in perfect Faith because he didn't live in the realm of of the world you understand he was in the world but he was not of the world just like how we are in this world we are not of this world amen amen so in this age in the age of adoption in the mind of Christ come God wants us to think on his level yes far too long we've been looking at things in our with our own wisdom our own wisdom will fail us yes amen our wisdom is limited amen that's why you find the most intelligent theologians of the world they study the scriptures spend hours studying the scriptures yes but they can never never understand the things that you and I can see yes why they can't see this because they kind have fellowship with God you to for you to have fellowship with God you must come to his level amen amen yes amen if you want to go and have fellowship with learned people you can't be th an illiterate person sitting amongst learned people trying to have fellowship with them you don't enjoy the company because you're going to talk about things maybe use Grand and things that you might not understand it if you want to speak to a talented person maybe a talented musician he can't have fellowship with you if you're not a talented musician with him while he's talking about music and playing his music now you're trying to have Fellowship around his music how can you have fellowship if you're not one with him yes so how can you have fellowship with God if you are not one with God Amen that's why Jesus prayed this prayer Jesus wanted a Oneness that become one with him and the only way you can become one with him you have to realize that you always wear powery amuah amen but by sin you were separated from him but within you amen that part the Gen of God was always within you that part was always there he just needed that light to bring it forth to life amen he just needed the seven ters to come and awaken you out of that spiritual Amnesia that you was under you thought you was under this world system you thought you were under some church system but the word came to awaken you amen amen because God didn't want you an ordinary citizen he wanted you as part of his body to continue the work amen and he say now come up a little higher amen you are called to greater things you are living in the astronaut age amen you are not living in a thing in a time where people live in awesome buggy age you're not living the time in aerplane age in a motor car age you are living the time to come up higher fire the things amen yes Lord amen thank you Lord and God said I will share my glory with no man oh thank you Lord but only to those that are part of him yes amen those that belong that's why the the book nobody could even was worthy to even look upon the book to look at that book but John is now taking the book from the angel there yeah he's give us a book no one was worthy to found to look at it for John is the end of the book yes you can't not just take the book John you can eat it yes partake of it John just let it become part of you Lord John let it come one with you come one with the book amen amen thank you Lord every day you reading of the word you are becoming Into His Image amen amen you are becoming more and more like him you're becoming lesser and lesser of yourself oh yes Lord thank you amen so we can have two the Bible said how can two walk together L they be in agreement amen we have to we can't walk with God we can't fellowship with God L we agree on his word amen amen amen Enoch worked with God he was in agreement with God he had fellowship with God Amen and he was one with God he was he was so much in tune with God that one day while his his walk took him to a Heavenly walk amen yes his walk made in change Dimensions amen amen and when you are walking with God though you are living on the earth you are seated here now in Heavenly places you are not looking at things to to your own mind now you are looking this at things to the eyes of God's word amen you are seeing things far beyond you know there was a man one time he was an in Inventor and he invented a certain device and he and he and he and he invented his device before should I say ahead of his time and he got married and when he was trying to invent this device he needed money he borrowed money and things were financially hard and then the family started fighting with him his wife started wondering why he spending so much investing so much time to invent this she couldn't see the vision she couldn't see the bigger picture and then he eventually he had to borrow money from his in-laws for his invention and then when he didn't come through immediately he had the in-laws got upset with him and it became a family war and then eventually as time went on his wife even left him But as time went on when it came to that right time to meet the right when when his invention was now to take off when it came at the right time people would with the with the same mind with the mind frame like him could see why they needed this invention he became a a very rich man a very successful man but at the time when he was making this invention nobody could could see it yes no because he did it Beyond his time ahead of his time and nobody could see what was the end product and when God looked you and at you and I oh yes nobody else could see the end product but he himself oh thank you Lord the master designer amen the master architect because he making that Masterpiece oh yes nobody could see it through the seven as it was coming to to each Church age and everyone was thinking this church is falling apart in each age then he sends a messenger on H age to catch the people amen amen and then it was still building up and then he must have thought Satan must have thought he won it at the Dark Ages when everything completely darkened out but then came Luda and said that just shall live by faith am some light began to strike amen and then came the me Agee and where they came along with the message of sanctification yes amen because now you must be Sanctified and set apart for service amen then while they were set service they still needed to see some power of God they needed some spark there amen amen and then came the Pentecostal age and the gift came down amen showing these are the first fruits amen these are some gifts these are showing you now that these that God is with this people and God is still in the business but you had it took a prophet now to come and go in the back part of God's mind to see this entire plan this entire Plan of Redemption that God had this perfect invention amen yes that he was going to produce himself in human flesh in a many membered body he was going to reproduce himself again amen he's not going to reproduce another but he's going to reproduce himself yes that's why this bride she knows she has his mind she know what he wants done with the word she's become part of him amen but that is why we need to pray for Revelation amen must desire to have more revelation of God's word because why his thoughts are higher than our thoughts amen his ways are higher than our ways you look at your needs you're going by and a Believer and you're saying oh Lord but I'm look at me I've got this problems right now how can I worry about spiritual when I have this material things but didn't he say don't take thought yes of what food you going to eat yes or what clothes you're going to wear he said tomorrow will sort itself out amen he knows the things you have need of you think God is not going to meet with your needs he'll never give you more than you can enjoy and sometimes you go to suffering because suffering is working patience he's testing your faith every son and daughter of God must be tried amen amen amen it must be tried in a fire because why he's purging you right now he's bringing you to Perfection amen amen amen because you are not going to go to the FY to the fiery hell or to the or to the place of tormen in hell to the Lake of Fire you are not you going to escape that you are here right now being tried and tested showing that you are a son and daughter of God Amen that you can withstand the evil one amen amen that you can surrender to his word you can't be so many years in the message still struggling to surrender yes amen you can't be years and years in the message and say I'm here for so long and struggling to surrender to him surrender means to stop resisting to an opponent and submit to their Authority Lord amen so we must stop resisting God's word yes amen stop resisting God and surrender to his authority you might be say Lord I still need to sort these things out in my life I still have these issues that's the problem you are trying to do it amen that is not surrendering when you surrendering say Lord I completely leave everything to your feet right now I lay myself I yeld myself unto you Lord come and take control that's what he wants he wants you to come and live in the realm of his glory yes amen and if you surrender yourself to him he puts his spirit in you and his Spirit leads you guides you preserve you amen amen but when you st keep saying Lord I still got these things to worry about I need to do this Lord I need to do that you are being influenced from beneath amen you're still struggling because you are influenced from another a fth dimension when we should be influenced from above amen remember we are vessels of honor to God am that's what we are we are in vessels amen God look looks at us not the way we look at ourselves he looks at us already perfect the book of 2 Corinthians 3: 7-18 says but if the ministration of death written and engraven in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious yes for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more do the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory yes amen for even that which was made glorious and no glory in this Respect by reason of the glory that excelled for for if that which is done away was glorious so that was glorious right yes much more that which remain it amen is glorious seeing then that we have such hope we use great Pless of speech and not as Moses which put a veil over his face not that the children of Israel could not steadfastly sorry that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remained the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the whole Testament that Veil is done away in Christ amen but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their hearts nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen so where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen there is freedom you know no longer in bondage amen yes amen that is why sometimes some people still have the Veil Just like how natural Israel even spiritually some people still have the veil because they're looking at it to a day gone by they look at it to the day of this is the day God did this in the time of the Prophet but God is doing it now God is working amongst us now amen he is here amongst us in the present because there is he preserved us for this hour because there is a people that got to do a work on the earth amen we are living in a time where man is going to is crying out for a savior man needs something to look to amen and they have no hope the only blessed hope and Assurance they can get it from is from you and I we are the instruments that God has chosen to use in this hour amen we are the vessels now you can choose to be a vessel Of Dishonor or a vessel of Honor now if you want to be used by God you have to be a vessel of honor and for you to be a vessel of Honor you have to surrender yourself completely unto him and for you to surrender yourself andto him you must die to self one of the greatest enemy that we have right now for God not to use us in his fullness is ourselves yes because our selfish nature is still thinking about temporary things yes our selfish nature want to satisfy things that we have need of in this temporal life in this life whereby maybe you live under 60 in good 17 good and after you down your such a temporal life such a temporal life we don't want to surrender to God when he can use us in his fullness God wants to do so much more amongst us because he said I will present my myself a glorious church he not asking you to think on your own thoughts he said my thoughts are higher than your thoughts he wants you to have his mind amen he wants you to have his thoughts he wants you to have fellowship with him in the way he thinks amen he want you to come up higher to his level but far too long we are kept down on Earthly things because that's what Satan does he wants to keep us in bondage he wants to keep us as slaves slaves in our work slaves to the things of this life slaves to the cares of everything that around us amen all our Earthly Pleasures all our Earthly family who spends too much of time with us all our our work life our bosses they want to keep us in bondage but that is what Satan is doing we need to go up higher amen amen you are just those Earthly things that we do are just to get by in this life that is not our purpose God put us here for a special purpose amen and his purpose stands amen God purpose stands amen amen we go to work we do we do the things we do is to get by in this life but it's not the main purpose that's what you need to understand we need to get delivered from that mindset that every day when we wake up we are living for God's purpose amen not wake up I'm going I'm waking up because I have to go to work I'm waking up because I have to go to school I'm waking up because I have to to do this and do that I am waking up because I'm here to fulfill God's purpose and wherever he put me I am fulfilling his purpose Hallelujah if he put me in the school I am fulfilling his purpose if he put me in the workplace I am fulfilling his purpose I am here to carry out his mandates because I understand my father's Kingdom amen yes amen this is the hour where we understand father's Kingdom we understand how it operates amen maybe there was a time we thought we were just a church goer but now we understand that we are here to carry out the business of our father's Kingdom amen amen and let me tell you something about our father our father is not slack amen our father doesn't take vacation his business is 24/7 amen our father's business he's 24/7 Our Father does not sleep he does not Slumber amen we speaking this this morning living in the realm of his glory amen because why I chose this topic is you know we are so we are living in in the hustle and bustle of our daily lives that's why I started off saying that the gospel has become practical now this message has become practical to us because this message has come to perfect Us in every of our Liv amen it come to perfect marriages it's come to perfect Us in the way we conduct ourselves to amongst people it come to show us because remember it's been a long time since the world s Christian true Christians out of you and I you go look at the church world right can the can a person from the world say or a person who not encountered Christianity say they something different different about these people ask yourself the question and I don't want to say because I'm in a message don't chield yourself and say I'm veiled by the message ask yourself as an individual can your family around you can the peers at work can your colleagues say that there is something different about this person amen lots of people around your workplace are professing Christianity they all now saying they're fasting and praying they all doing this thing but can somebody say there's something different about this person and I'm not talking about a person that I'm Pious you know I'm not talking about acting spiritual I'm talking about look just your character your nature showing the joy that you have you know when people are all shocked and living in fear right now what's going to happen next tomorrow what's going to happen with the economy you already know these things yes amen you know what's going to happen into the economy right amen you already know the things that are happening around the world you know about the world don't be surprised that South Africa didn't get what they didn't they wanted to achieve you know why they didn't achieve it because you know that the Angels ow the wind amen hallelujah they want to go to a court and try to bring a ceasefire but the angels of God are controlling the walls amen amen that's right you can't have a ceasefire in this hour we at walk amen there's not going to be no ceasefire in this hour we are at spiritual war amen this battle is Raging yeah this battle is not going to stop just like our naturally around the world is battles raging right now yeah all over the world in the Red Sea and so forth right in Russia Ukraine in the Red Sea China got the issues there Iran got the issues there everyone got the issues yes the battles are raging amen earthquakes in diverse places yes amen Satan demon powers are influencing mankind leaders of the world that's why they going to gather together dorce to orchestrate to design a system Amen to design a system to control the economy did that did that not happen in Pap Rome in the Bible did it not happen it didn't happen in the Dark Ages where they were controlling things is it not the same demons people die demons don't die Spirits don't die Spirits don't die so nothing is new Under the Sun yes there's nothing new Under the Sun all these things are happening right now so can someone say this is a different person there's something peculiar about this person am there's something peculiar about this person he says I have a hope I have a God that I believe in despite my circumstances I can rise above my circumstances hallelujah amen so in despite all the things that are going on right now let us not lose sight don't look at your things to canalize because I'm telling you now you'll be depressed with the world if you're going to try and reason things with your human understanding I can go and Route okay let's let's let's take a topic if you look at politics for example look at your own country you're going to get depressed yeah if you try to try to reason with them in their politics you can't because you got to understand what what's happening around the world you can understand South Africa is a small porn in political G in a big world political game which is now without control by the God of this evil age South Africa is not run by the ANC as you think it's run by the ANC think higher thoughts now yes understand God's plan understand who's the god of the evil age understand who offered Jesus the kingdom of this world yes but it's the Bible says the meek shall inherit the earth amen we this is our inheritance amen this is our domain amen God created the Earth for us yes amen God was the god of heaven and he made man Adam the god of the earth amen amen because why Adam could not control all have dominion over all things amen but Adam how did he fall he went and listened to his wife who went off the word and and that's what Satan is trying to do now is come and take us to go off the word amen once you go off the word but Adam knew that Eve was part of him she was going to fall and die right there he had to go and be partake of her yes he had to partake of her because he had to because that was going to save him yes that's right if he didn't party Adam could have said no the evil would have been done but it was part of him he had to fall with yeah just like Jesus said to come down we were part of him amen amen yes amen and now we take his righteousness amen he took our sin amen he bore our sin at Calvary now we take his righteousness that we can have life and have it Eternal amen amen because outside of Jesus Christ there is no eternal life right amen yes that's right so it's easy for us to lose sight of the glory that God is surrounding us with yes it's easy you you you walk tomorrow to work you go and you're not full of the Holy Ghost I'm telling you it's easy yeah but God is keep reminding us of this thing through his word amen that's why he got the preaching of the Gospel to keep hammering to to remind us amen God got the fivefold ministry for perfecting us it's for our good amen amen God don't bring the 54 Ministry to take you out of the Bride it brings it to place you in your place positionally place you amen the glory of God is Not Just An mere attribute that you think it his divine nature yes amen and that's why Peter said we are partakers of his divine nature it's about his Holiness yes it's about his majesty his Splendor amen amen all of this Encompass around it yes and that is why before esta could come into the Royal Palace and when the King was having this feast and he called vashi he wanted her to be part he wanted her to come amongst his associates to show the Splendor that he had he wanted her to be part of the splendor but she was self she was worried about herself she was focused on herself she was focused on smaller things she couldn't think higher thoughts like the king cuz the King was going to show her the Splendor and he wanted somebody he can offer off his kingdom to he wanted someone to have to rule with him amen who was foot to rule but she wasn't foot to rule because she was all about herself so we going to be worried about ourself ourself ourself how are we going to be foot to rule because the Bible says we going to judge the Earth the Saints shall judge the Earth amen we going to rule and reign with him amen and for us to rule and reign with him we got to be part of his Splendor we got to be part of his majesty that's why Esther now when she could put on a royal Apparel in the time of remember it wasn't a time when the king called go but Esther wasn't called amen but it was a desperate hour it was a desperate time but when but the way she approach the king he could see this is a person that's foot to rule with me this is a person that I can share my glory with amen amen that's why he could offer a half of his kingdom because why she knew when she put on the Royal p she could see now what she was put there for amen she you could see the main purpose of what she was put in the Kingdom for and now the Bible say those that are full with the Holy Ghost are crying and sign for the abomination of the Lost amen what are you putting the to for yes you can't be seeing people that are going to hell and be normal with it yes you can't be looking at man in such a sinful condition and feel normal about it amen then you're not thinking like your father yes that's why he said come up higher you need to see the full teacher John there's people that are going to be lost here John there's people that are going to go through the tribulation there's people are are not going to see Heaven there's people are going to go to hell amen right now there's people that you can be preaching and preaching to and they won't get it because they don't want to surrender to him because why their conscious is already in h that's right you're going to go out there in this hour of the Third po you can be preaching the gospel and the people won't listen to you but your job is to preach the gospel amen one day one day God is a righteous judge and when he's judging them one day he's going to be playing in a big screen and how you was talk presenting the gospel to them how you presented Christ to them and how they rejected it yes Psalms 191 says the heavens declare the glory of God yes the skies above Proclaim his handy works creation itself testifies to the glory of our creator amen from the vastness of the cosmos yes to the intricacies of a single cell God's glory is displayed for all to see amen hallelujah amen Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3:18 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image amen from Glory unto Glory from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen that is transforming power in US yes amen be not conformed to the pth of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind Romans 12:2 the why it says that is because at one time you have your mind is thinking on this five sense is in line to your five senses only and you're thinking as on the things that you see with your natural eyes and the things that you hear with your ears naturally all your senses right the things that you feel the things that you touch the things that you smell but now you're thinking when the six yet com in faith come by faith you accept Jesus Christ and now you accept this word the mind of Christ comes down yes so you are thinking now that mind that mind of of Christ now you are being transformed now into the image because you are seeing his image amen amen you're seeing it through the word the adulterated word the word can't change for no man yes amen this very gospel that we receive is an unadulterated word amen we can't change it amen we can't add to it we cannot take out from it amen it is a perfect word hallelujah because if God had to change his word it mean he wasn't perfect he wasn't all knowing god he knew things or as it God knows things like our mind can't fathom it because we got a finite mind he's got an infinite mind in knew the beginning to the end he know all things amen and that's why his word is so perfect and now man wants to come and reason with God's word and tell you know it means this and it should evolve with time God word doesn't evolve with time amen the only thing that will evolve with you is your revelation of the word amen the only thing that evolves is that you seek it more clearly now because the more you come into His Image it's becoming more plain to you it's become that's why I said now the gospel is practical because now you can take it you can apply it yes amen you'll hear the testimony the other day but the dear sister amen you take the gospel that we receiving prayer of faith went forth and the Mir was done amen because why you took the word you believed as Believers you can stand in the Gap amen you had Faith to believe that you have to believe God's word you have to believe that he's a Healer and you can believe that he's still healing today if you don't believe he heals today if you if you got doubt in that word then you can't apply it that's right if you if you have doubt that he's a mirical working God then you can't say he's a god of mirical and ask for a medical amen you trusting God for need you don't believe is Jehovah J you're provided to today amen then how are you going to ask him to meet with your needs yeah how are you going to ask him to provide for your needs if you can't see him as a Healer today then how are you going to ask for healing amen you got to see him in the now amen oh no but it's just my brother and sister praying no then you are looking at it carnally that's not your brother that's a son and daughter of God when you see them you seeing Jesus Christ amen that is why many of you know the testimony when I was when the Lord healed me day while we having a family Al call that day when my wife was approaching me I didn't see her I knew there was something different about the continence and I sense that the angel of God was there amen within me I sin that this is not ordinary amen and I surrendered myself to it I raised my hands up and I received my healing to this day not a single pain you can't even touch and feel anything thank you Lord completely healed [Music] ameny Lord so I know but the god that can heal yes that's why I said this God has become so practical to us amen he's become so personal to us amen just as Moses in Mount sa amen he radiated God's glory amen our Liv Our Lives should shine forth with the Light of Christ amen Matthew 5:16 says encourage us saying let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven amen people may see the glory of God in you and then you may give glory to God because all glory will go to God amen amen but they will see God through you yes and who they be giving glory to God God so God wants to be glorified and the way he's glorified is through you and I because why let me let me explain this more properly in a more simple way God needs to be glorified he's the king of glory amen amen and for him to be glorified in this day in this hour they need to see the manifestations of God upon the Earth yes and the only way they can see it is through you and I amen amen and when the sing God being manifested through you and I which means the works that Jesus did Greater Works than is they shall do amen right the works of the Bible that they heard about in history the words that they hear about in the Bible stories they sing it now being manifested through you and I then they will give God the glory then God will be receiving the glory amen amen and he deserves the glory he needs to be glorified God name must be exalted amen that is why through testimonies God is exalted when testimonies happen and you testify who's being exalted are you being popped up and saying no it's my no we exalting God the reason why we give a testimony is because we are glorifying God Amen oh yes but you now if we want to come and live in the realm of his glory we have to abide in his presence amen how do we abide in his presence we have to dedicate ourselves to him yes we have to read the scripture it's normal Christian Life it's not it's a normal Christian work you read the Bible you pray you talk about him amen this is the common problem in the modern world people are ashamed to be associated with Jesus Christ I'm not talking about people say I go to church yeah we go to church we're having a a music show they call them what they call them conc concerts yeah we're having a concert we're having a banquet we having this great youth meeting in the church but are people talking about Jesus talking about the word what is Jesus Jesus is the word yes he said if you love me you will keep my word and my word will not be grieved people are afraid you know I was taking Joseph into school the other day and we saw this people going to the temple and I said josephin see these people are not embarrassed to go and say to go and worship in the temple they're walking in the messes early in the morning and I said see how they dressed up they dressed up decently I said but in church people don't dress up this our church I'm saying in the church world people who say they are Christian how do they dress up because they want to be still associated with the world these people are not of Shame now they're going to worship The God Who no doesn't exist or a demon a demon spirit and they are just declaring themselves properly in a decent manner but people are ashamed and we who profess to be believe the message this should be amongst us as well yes we should be setting the standard not letting the world set the standard US amen the standard shouldn't drop because God's word never changeed amen God we might be living in a modern time yes and maybe we say those things was for those days those Believers in early days no it's the same thing the standard of the message is still the same amen you don't say those days the people used to go in a beach and play at those you got the time to go pray yourself yes go in your closet and pray you don't need to show everybody you don't have to make it a public show between you and God but what you do in the private in secret God will show it in the public amen amen but what is wrong with you now to go and confess God what is wrong for you to go to the street I was speaking to the brother the other day at work and he was telling me he's going house to house he's knocking on doors now desperate to try and get the last one in he's telling me he's going door too evangelizing because why those that are fed with the Holy Ghost are crying and sigh for the abomination of the lost I mean how many time we sit around people different people that we come across do we at least one word of the Gospel at least something something different because everybody's topic is about money is about food the economy and politics how about something different how about eternal life how about presenting eternal life to them eternal life is only through Jesus Christ amen amen but you and I are the recips of eternal life but we can share that amen yes Psalms 27:4 says one thing I desire of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life amen to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple make seeking his presence amen a daily Pursuit for us amen each one of us should be make seeking the Lord's presence our daily goal because that is the end game that is the rupture message the prophet preached in Psalms 27 in the Rapture message you can't desire to go in the Rapture if you don't start here that's because the Rapture cycle already started yes amen the shout was to gather us together yes amen for the Rapture amen because the Bible said the bride had made herself ready are we doing that every day making ourselves ready is that our desire to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of our life so we going to do it there same there wa why we not dwelling now in his presence we must dwell now in his if you you won't be there if you don't dwell now if you are not in his presence dwelling presence now then you cannot be there because you have to be one he said father maybe the may they be one even as we are one you have to be one with him now yes that's why Jesus said many were coming that day said Lord have I not prophesied in your name have I not cast out demons in the same he said depart from me workers of iniquity I know you not he never knew him there wasn't a union with him there wasn't an intimacy amen but the go gospel is calling us to rise above every circumstances Amen to rise above our troubles Philippians 4:13 says I can do all things through him who strengthens me amen what gives us strength is the glory of God that gives us strength that keeps us amen that keeps us from falling because let me tell you something if it's not the holy if it's not for the Holy Ghost We All Fall every day we backslide every day we fall the the Holy Ghost is bringing conviction every day it's the holy ghost that convict you spoke the wrong you said you thought the wrong thought yes you can't hide what Psalm David is saying that in the psalm God know his thoughts God know his secret whatever he thinking in secret God knows it all the things that he thinks about even right to the end from the time he's born right to his end of days God knows it all God seees the entire picture you can't hide nothing from God Amen is that's why if you're conscious of his presence the first quote I read what the prophet said if you're conscious of his presence you'll know that you can't hide nothing from him and if you're conscious that the holy spirit is with you he's there to correct you amen he's there to navigate your life yes to put you on the right track Amen to put you on the right path the straight and narrow road it's not an easy path of God says oh I don't want of this Earth I don't want Treasures of this Earth I have Treasures in Heaven he said thank God one day I stepped into the astronaut tube the body of Jesus Christ baptized in there by the Holy Ghost and watching waiting listening at the countdown I seen the anges Ages come by come by come come by to the last age is counted off the next breath it's more than 3 minutes I mean less than 3 minutes sence says it's 3 minutes for the earth to be blowed up in time it's less than the next breath of Jehovah is come out of it my people come up higher we watch right here before the time comes and see the glorious power of God return to the church the presence of Jesus Christ the only presence showing that what he is and where he is and right amongst us doing the same works that he promised would be done in this age yeah he is proving that he's the same amen yes and that's what he's doing right here amen yes amen we're not talking about now A Time by we talking about it now amen cuz Hebrews 30 says 8 says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever there he was in the time of justification for Luda there he was in the time of sanctification for Wesley there he was in the time in zza Street the Pentecostal L de for what what was it the airplane age Pentecostal now yeah yeah he is an the astronaut that leaves Beyond goes to outer space amen but we know we're going in a seventh dimension for the wedding supper amen amen we're going to bypass all that amen we bypassing the moon we bypassing the sixth Dimension I'm talking about those that are alive and remain those that are going to be changed here now those that are going to me the rapture we bypassing the sixth Dimension because those from the sixth Dimension are coming here yes yes and they're not living without us amen they living with us amen yes we go together amen they have gone on before us but we all go together as one body of Christ amen amen as the bride of Christ we going to the wedding supper amen glory to God listening to the countown while waiting the Zero Hour the hour when he strikes we passed the Pentecostal age they organized it and God J fasing went right on back into Babylon like the rest of them and what have they got today listen when would it just Pew them when they got lukewarm it's pewing time it it rejects it it takes the remnant out of it and count down over an astronaut is gone for heaven he said come go brother come go sister be sure don't take no chances don't depend just on some Luan experience or Methodist experience or Pentecostal experience and to say don't depend on past experience of message Believers have your own experience yes amen us that are listening now even myself let us have our own experience let us come on up in the heavenlies now amen let us come to live in the realm of his glory now Hallelujah he said let us come up into the heavenli now up into the righteousness of God Amen don't say Lord I'm trying to get this right I need I need some time within time Lord I will give this up what in time I'll give up that no take his righteousness amen Lay Your Filthy rag that his feet and take on his righteousness amen and walk in Holiness the only way you can walk in Holiness is when the Holy Spirit comes upon you hallelujah amen because he give you a filthy Spirit he's given you the holy spirit amen say Lord take away my filthy EGS yes Lord I don't want to live the way I used to live Lord I'm tired of struggling in sin amen Lord I I Just Surrender completely and wholly unto you Lord take me Lord I am your prisoner Lord then you watch how he comes down and say Lord use me completely I Surrender my caral thoughts I Surrender myly thoughts I Surrender my own Ambitions Lord but Lord I now say Lord your thoughts are higher than my thoughts am let my thoughts align with your thoughts you know when you do that then you are having fellowship with him amen then you are coming on his level amen yes amen he said and manifest himself as same as he did when he was here on Earth you believe that I believe it's the same yesterday today and forever am it says the hour has come the bride has made herself ready oh made herself ready she laid aside all of these things amen remember Esther was chosen and the others was rejected and only those that b born again that God the spirit of God will be the chosen that day amen that the Crown of Glory will be set upon a head and the others will be rejected Bashi was taken out given a bull of divorcement then the others that came in the many others that came in all the virgins only Esther was chosen amen and then the time come where she had put on the Royal panel and then the king saw that this is a person that's foot to rule and he said now I can give you even to half the king amen amen what a glorious message amen amen what a glorious time we living in he says now immediately after he showed the end of the age of his work here he went on up into heaven he said I'll show you what's going to be after this after the church ages he said John I can't talk to you down there no more cuz I left down here amen I've come up higher amen come up here with me and I'll show you what's going to take place here after oh the Lord can't keep us we can't he can't speak to us in his Earthly his Earthly realm amen we got to come up higher amen amen we got to come up to his level amen yes and then we can understand these things amen and to come up in his level we have to surrender all these Earthly things and he was caught up in the vision caught up into Glory his experience must have been something like that of Paul 2 Corinthians 12:2 to 4 and he says Paul was caught up one day into a vision too did you know that and he saw things that wasn't expedient for him to even talk about 14 years not even mentioned it but listen at the difference between them when Paul saw he was forbidden to speak of it or to put it down out to the public he saw things that he couldn't talk about a guess he didn't have the words he was caught up in a third heaven how different when John was caught up and seen Jesus you was he said write it in a book what you have seen and give it back send it back to the churches Paul was forbidden to speak and John was even asked to put it in a book so it would all go down to the ages amen but it was sealed up but in this age in the days of the voice of the Seven Angels when he shall he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be revealed amen and now that it's revealed it was still stored up amen yes cuz he's preaching in a time when you and I was not there it was preserved and stored up but now once again this message has come to the Holy Ghost amen and now how he's bringing it out to the five-fold ministry bringing it back again the same very word but now he's making it plain to you amen this word that was was sealed up is not sealed anymore it's plain through the why through the message of William brandham who's come and brought this message but it was stor up for this time for this hour when now you will eat it and the word becomes practical now now it becomes a manifestation amen this word that you eaten up now now it's manifested is now become a manifested word yes not a written word not a revealed word but a manifested word amen through a many membered body that is why when you are fulled with the Holy Ghost you don't just see yourself as part of just oh we this is my church this is my people you see yourself as part of the mystical body of Jesus Christ and you realize that yeah in Phoenix we got a part they in another town they got a part that people they got another part we a different part of the body they a different part of the body but each one of us have our inheritance in the land amen each one of us has an inheritance in our father's Kingdom amen our father has given us our inheritance and each one of us have to be in our rightful position and as we are now in this war each one in his rightful position different ranking soldiers amen different typ of soldiers because you got different different squads amen maybe you got people with different machine guns then you got people with different artillary artillery people Rockets people with with with different types of ammunition but we all are fighting the same battle amen we fighting a one common enemy that is Satan but we are one body Christ amen you have to see that one amen that is why Satan tried to put the conterfeit and they all saying now we are one body that's why the pope is gathering all the Protestants together he's seeing the counterfeit because Satan must have his counterfeit but if there's a counterfeit there must be the genuine yes amen amen if there's a false anointed one there must be the true anointed one amen amen so he sees I'm just finishing how different when John was caught up so he said oh notice John being taken up immediately after the church age was a type of the raptured church immediately after the church age is over this lateran age then comes the Rapture the church goes up like John did into the presence of God Amen just that just wins my soul around caught up at the Rapture of the church amen if you are not caught up now in his glory you're not caught up in the Rapture you've got to be caught up now amen under the mystery of the Seven Seals amen caught up now under the mystery in his glory living in the realm of his glory not in the realm of man not in the realm of a day gone by but in the realm of his glory amen partakers of his divine nature yes doing the very work that he did so what so who can be glorified so he can be glorified amen so God can be glorified when God is manifested again on the earth through you and I as his instrument that's what we are his instruments his vessels his vessels of Honor his name will be glorified and what he's going to do he's going to Crown you the Queen of Heaven amen with his righteousness he's going to Crown you with his righteousness amen he's already clothed his eyes with his righteousness but he's in a crown you with glory amen let's stand to our [Applause] feet thank you Lord thank you Jesus this [Music] sing the song at the same time at the [Music] same soon as this the Bri is together at the
