========================================

amen and greet you all in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen ities that our Bibles returned to the book of second Samuel reading from chapter seven chapter seven verse 1. and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the Lord has given him rest round about from all his enemies that the king said unto Nathan the prophet see now I I dwell in the house of Cedar yeah but the Ark of God dwelleth within curtains and Nathan set up to the king go do all that is in thine hearts for the Lord is with thee and he came to pass that night that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan to sing go and tell my servant David thus say the Lord shall thou burn me in house for me to dwell in whereas I have not dwelled in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt even to this day but I've walked in a tent and in a tabernacle amen and in all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel speak I a word with any of the tribes of Israel whom I commanded to Feed My People Israel saying why not mean House of cedar now therefore so shall thou say unto my servant David thus say the Lord of hosts I took thee from the sheep coats from following the Sheep to be ruler over my people over Israel now we know that the prophet illustrates that but if you want to also want to put that to us from where the Lord has taken us amen and he also he said to them that overcome will I give to situ being the Bible also say don't you know the sin shall judge the Earth yes amen [Music] and don't you know that you're going to be judging as the Queen of Heaven amen and I and I was with thee with our Winters and I've cut off all the enemies out of thy sight and made thee a great name amen amen we are associated with Jesus yes that's why we've been given that name amen and he has taken off all the cut out all our enemies and he kneeling on the cross amen every sickness every disease every affection mainly on the cross remove those enemies from us and then he went and conquered death and the grave amen now the greatest fear has been death and he's taken his out taking the fear away yes yes amen and he made us Kings and Priests to be ruling and reigning with him amen amen what's the greatest name on the earth the greatest memory about man can be saved and where even demons the name of Jesus and it allowed us to have that name amen and not only is that he says yeah yeah he's dwelling temporarily it was a type because he already planned God already in his mind that he wants to have this Tabernacle to dwell in amen and that Tabernacle is the body of Christ that body that Tabernacle is amongst his sons and daughters that he wants to come and dwell in amen amen and he showed it when Jesus comes on Earth that was the temple that was the body and now it out of Jesus side comes the bride yes amen because Jesus the Fulfillment of Jesus body the Tabernacle was Jesus himself but out of his side comes the the bride which is part of the the Tabernacle of God Amen and on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost comes down gives birth to the church so he can come now and dwell in his body amen but out of the blood of Jesus you couldn't do that amen yes and I was with thee with us whoever thou Winters and have cut off all thy enemies out of thy sight and I made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the Earth amen man you are associated with a great heritage starting from Abraham and so forth amen a great name amongst the Great Men amen amen were the apostles with brother Branham yes would the Great Men We associated with that yes moreover I will appoint a place for My People Israel and will plan them and they may dwell in a place of their own amen a provided place yes yes and move no more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them anymore as Before Time amen amen before you attract in sin you are a slave your body to the enemies you you were in this denomination you had all type of religions the devil had you bound but now you are set free because to whom the son of man set free is free indeed yes amen we also turn to the book of Ephesians before we be seated chapter 1 verses 3 to 14. hmm blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings Amen in Heavenly places in Christ yes according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love yes having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself yes according to the good pleasure of his will Amen to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the Beloved Amen in whom we have Redemption through his blood yes amen aren't we thankful for the blood tonight the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had abounded us towards us in all wisdom and Prudence Abid made known unto us the mystery of his world thank you according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ which are on earth even in him yes in whom also we have obtained an inhabitants being predestinated according to the purpose of IMU worketh all things after the Council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory yes who first trusted in Christ in whom yeh also trusted after that you heard the word of truth yes the gospel of your salvation amen amen so you have to receive the truth for your day amen in whom also after that she believed so you have to yeah and believe it amen and yeah we're sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise amen which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased position unto the praise of his glory amen thank God for the reading of his word also we learned too quickly to the book of Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6. Hebrews 11 6. but without faith it is impossible to please him yes for he that comes to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder amen amen don't you love that amen of them that diligently seek Him amen amen you know we always have to sing when you're preaching we say come to the altar and other the minute we say come to the altar you have the concept in your mind that I have to come to the to the front to the altar here because that's the tradition that we taught by but the order is actually the sacrifice the author was meant for sacrifice in other words when you come you when you come to the order you're going to die to yourself amen you've got to sacrifice the flesh man you got to sacrifice the things that are keeping you away from the presence of God yes amen so if you are diligently seeking seeking him it means you are you are forsaking the things that is keeping you away from his presence because you cannot seek him while you are also seeking things that satisfy the flesh man amen because God is his spirit amen and those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in church so tonight I'm gonna speak on living in my father's economy amen amen amen yes and the only way you can live under your father's economy in this day is under the third pool yes and the third pool I know many are proclaiming they take the scriptures and they take the blessings of the scripture but we're talking about the economy of God that comes through faith amen amen it's a faith economy amen and you find that when God wanted man to live under this economy it was a perfect economy but if if traded this economy for listening to the serpent in the Garden of Eden and traded it for the tree of knowledge and through the tree of knowledge he brought forth deaths he brought for every doubt yes he brought forth everything that's negative upon the Earth and because of that a separation from God it allowed Satan and his demon powers to infiltrate the human race yes but God wants you Insurance to dwell in his presence amen amen and if you are in his presence you are in his economy and you cannot dwell in the presence of God if you miss the message of the hour yes yes amen because the Bible says in Amos 3 7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his Secrets unto his servants the prophets amen so when you come if you want to come under God's economy you have to first accept His prophets yes because all the time he was living in Amnesia but the seven Thunders come to awaken you amen amen to where you really come from amen he come to awaken you to show that you are a spirit man trapped in a flesh body yes that you are now trapped in a pest house and because of the fall of Man In the Garden of Eden you are trapped there yes but Jesus come to make a way for you amen amen yes he come out to make a way so once again he can get the other man back on the earth because God was feeling for his Fallen son Adam and now he's feeling for the sons of Adam that were Fallen amen and to live under God's economy you cannot do that not being a Son of God and the only way you can recognize your son of God is come under his calling yes you have to come under sonship amen because when you come under Sunshine being tutored and you come to maturity now you have the keys amen yes and now you can make use of the inheritance amen Jesus said in John 15 5 I am the vine here are the branches he that abided in me and I name the same bring it forth much fruits yes without me can do nothing yeah if a man abide not in me is cast forth as a brunch and he's withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and he burned if you ain't abide in near my words abide in you you shall ask what you will amen and it shall be done yes thank you Lord hearing is my father glorified that you ain't bear much fruits so shall ye be my disciple amen so they are principles in living in God's economy amen and the principle firstly is obedience to his words yes because what are these words you cannot have faith and faith is a substance yes the problem of God says not an imagination yes in the message you can put it there in the message perfect faith it says faith it is a substance and not an imagination not an emotion yes but something that you have and it comes to you by hearing the word of God and that only Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God that puts it back to where your feet that is not in some individual it's not in a man it's not in an organization it's not in a group of people it's in God because God is the word yes amen your faith is in God yes amen so God come to us establish Us in this truth because we are living in a Time where man is lying on the natural thing to survive in the economy because under the tree of knowledge they have left Faith they have neglected to to come to the true word of God and they decided to take off the tree of knowledge yes they keep and they're still partaking of the tree of knowledge so if you want to live in God's economy and if your life is partaking of the tree of knowledge and you're not partaking of the things of God then your influence is going to come from there yes yes and your faith is going to be on that economy and that's not a that's not a faith that's a reasoning and there is a doubt that that is why you find now people they have left what God has given them which was a perfect word and they now started to reason they started to dwell on Satan's economy and that is why you find there was a falling away now because they went into the tree of knowledge reasoning and doubts reasoning and doubt and you can't mix death with faith amen you can't make doubt in faith amen but you can't live in God's economy without perfect Faith yeah yeah amen yes because to dwell in God's economy you got to live in a world of perfect Faith amen amen because God's economy is not our economy sting yes a caramel man looks at things by his senses by his five senses but the things of God are based on faith and faith has to be anchored on something and he has to be anchored on the revealed word of God Amen the word given by Revelation yes amen amen and that is why if you have a revelation of the word that is why when you talk about the heaven you have a revelation of Heaven out of the message of the hour you don't have a revelation of these things you don't have a revelation of Hell you don't have a revelation of these horseraders that are writing right now how can you afraid to believe those things I can come and tell you the Bible show you by the Bible but if it's not to revealed to you if the Antichrist Spirit that's on the Earth right now is not to reveal to you how can you have faith then to believe that yes it has to be angered on something amen and it has to be the absolute amen amen and that's the word of God Amen and that is why when you look at a circumstance for example if a doctor give a prognosis and he says right you have sickened with cancer and cancer is in your body it is now first stage and now it is nothing else we can do is being honest to you because he's telling you he's going as far as his textbooks checks him right he's taking you as far as your checkbook and take him yes but as a Believer you have been shown there was a problem that came in the cancer age amen and the angel of God come to insult him to go into not even cancer would stand in your way amen amen yes and then he takes the people back to the to where it originated from he takes him right to the Garden of Eden where sin come from where every disease comes from amen then you open up your spiritual senses to take you to the Realms of demon powers amen amen and show you that what what the doctor is not learning in his in his university that now that cancer is a demon Spirit upon this person and now to to go and and now defeat this cancer you've got to come by the spirit of God to go as a Son of God and know that it's a finished work on Calvary and then you have to know that a sonship I am in God's economy now I am a rightful Heir and I have the right to say these signs shall follow them that believe they shall cast out demons in my name they shall flee amen amen when the land on the sick they shall recover amen yes so you know that the demons are subject to the authority and the demon got it when they recognize that now you know that you are a son this person is walking as a son this person is conducting a himself of the sun those demons know that amen yes but his principles in the kingdom of God Amen you're gonna give your time and dedication to separate yourself from the flesh man you got to sacrifice your time into prayer you've got to separate separate yourself in time into fasting you know there was a time in the there was a case there was a sister there was trouble by this evil spirit and the sister was tormented by the spirit yes and it was tormenting us you just come over there speak to where and do funny things so the sister brought the store attention so I know the scripture said these things come out by fasting and prayer yeah so I went into my study and I fasted and Afraid for the sister and the Very hour that I was fasting and praying that Spirit went to the sister and said there are some brothers that are coming to chase me away I'm not coming back anymore and by the time we went there the spirit already left us I didn't have to go there when I was fasting in prayer because we are doing Warfare Amen in the spiritual Dimension there are dimensions that we can conquer through prayer amen we can conquer the spiritual Dimensions to prayer while Daniel was praying there was a spiritual conflict going on amen amen in every there was a prince that was there the demon of Persia the prince called The Prince of poison it was a demon Spirit there's a witch telling Gabriel to come and give Daniel a message but then Daniel's prayer brought to heaven and Daniel Gable sought refuge and Michael comes and defeats uh the Prince of Persia and then Gabriel comes into the message so that's why when God wants to give you a message sometimes when you come into the service come prayfully yes amen amen pray for the meetings yes because the devil wants to start from the spirits yeah the devil will do everything remember you got to recognize if you understand God's economy he's spiritually economy how it works amen there's also demon powers yes that's trying to stop you from the blessings of God there's demon powers around it when you prevent your blessing you might be have someone sitting in a meeting they might have a need but your wrong attitude will cause that person not to receive the healing amen that's right you may you may you may have a blessed service and leave from the service as soon as you go you just have to think about your work you start to think about tomorrow and all these things and then you lose your blessing yes amen because while you are living in a different economy yes true amen Lord amen so God you say the news message in perfect paragraph 43 he said see if you had perfect Faith you look right straight to God and believe it and walk away amen talk about the person that comes in the prayer line now I've got a ailment whatever he said if you had perfect faith you look straight to God I mean you believe his word right you take him at his word and you walk away yes you would have no need of coming back into a prayer line sorry coming to a prayer line you'd have no need of these things because your faith has done made it so yes what would be the use for me saying I go to put a shirt on when I already got a shirt on yes right how do you know you got a shirt on well I see it I feel it I know it's there well that's just how real that when perfect Faith takes a hold you don't need no more it's already done you know it yes how do you know it Faith tells me so that's it do you get it now what I mean that's perfect Faith yes it settled amen if you're taking God by his word and you're quoting the promises of it of his word it settles it amen amen I was telling president the other day and I was telling brother said well there was a brother who used to be a friend of mine before I got saved from before I got saved so when he was working in a company there was a truck driver when a problem with this truck he came to do a delivery and his truck wouldn't start from time to time every time he takes off he goes a certain kilometers and it breaks down so the brother remember he had a message I think it was in MP3s at that time well I don't know what it was in the tapeworm he said I got this message I want you to play it in your truck just play it while you're driving this you didn't go and say he didn't preach to him anything he didn't preach to him anything he just said just play this message while you're driving and this person put the message on and the truck never broke down so that person found him to testify or what happened and the message you know what the message was be certain of God amen amen amen see if you are certain of God and his words amen when you don't have that doubt not the slightest doubt amen there's no reason there's no room for God because deep down in there when faith comes in there's no doubt there's no room for doubt amen amen then let's settled it John 14 12 says unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do he do also and greater work than these shall he do because I go unto my father amen and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do yes that the father may be glorified in the Sun if you ask anything in my name I will do it yes if you now he's giving some principles now you're not just gonna take his word for the doing doing here's some principles if you love me keep my Commandments Amen in other words keep my words and I will pray the father and shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it see it him not neither nor same but they know him for he dwell it would you yes and shall be in you then he says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you thank you here's the dwelling place now here is where he wants to dwell amen amen yet a little while and the world see at me no more but yeah see me do we see him yes amen amen are we seeing him are we seeing him the way he's manifesting through the word and the ways manifesting to our lives amen and the countless Miracles that he's doing and the Bountiful blessings upon our life Hallelujah because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you amen where the world is experiencing spiritual death they are living he said because I love you shall live all over also in other words the resurrected power of Jesus Christ amen he's being seeing must be seen through this many membered body must be seen through his body amen and a dead day you shall know that I am a father and you ain't me and I knew he that has my Commandments and keep with them it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him amen now the now you see the economy of God right works now amen [Music] now I want to show you a bit further now you might be trusting God for a need now one day there was a woman with death in the land of Israel but it was a prophet on the scene amen and it comes with a word to her and this is you can open up second Kings chapter four one two seven maybe people are worried about their debts tonight let's see what the Lord says here Second Kings now they tried a certain woman of the wives of the son of the prophets unto Elisha saying here's Elisha coming with a double portion amen thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the Creditor has come to take unto him my two sons to be born men and Elisha said unto her what shall I do for thee tell me what is Dao in the house and she said that I had made had not anything in the house save a pot of oil you see she's looking at just the physical thing that she now she doesn't have right right she doesn't have that but watch our God the economy is going to change things around now [Music] then he said go borrow the vessels abroad of all our neighbors and empty vessels borrow not a few and when thou art coming Thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy Sons why saying shut the door this is not for everybody this is the third poor manifestation amen and thou shalt pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt sit aside hat which is full that which is full so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out and he came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed amen then she came and told the man of God and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debts and live thou and the children of the rest amen amen that's God's economy why I'm speaking like this because there's our coming there's gonna be a squeeze in the economy and then you you might not have that money to pay the debts but yes God giving you some insight if he's doing it then how much more he's going to do it now amen votes he said Greater Works than he is yes what did he do when he come to time to pay taxes and his Tax Collectors are coming he said that it said Peter he said him go send him to go get go to the fish and the fish will put money then the time you feed the children the multitudes out there he takes the five loaves of bread and the two fishes and he feeds them he multiplies it it comes at a wedding and now something that's strange now it takes water and turns it into wine amen yes come in the days of the prophet bring the squirrels into existence amen so how many of you can testify that God has already done this yes he's already doing these things yes my wife is a witness yeah one day we had a need of a certain amount of money to do some a project at home not in the southern in the house there in Phoenix and we needed a certain amount of money so I went the day into my study and I prayed for that amount of money Pacific amount of money that I needed according to the project then we went out for the day when we came back in the afternoon in our in the mail there was that amount of money that we needed given to us amen specifically how God will work that that male had to come be printed on a certain date and be posted on a certain date at the time when I will have a need for it and then prompt me because they have to be apart from me now prompt me to go and pray for that because God works on both ends amen and pray for that specific amount and he made a way and he's the same yesterday today and forever yes now if he did it then he's obligated to do it again yes amen amen amen that's the god that we serve that's if you want to lie on yourself then you can lie on yourself yes but my father owned the kettle on a thousand years amen I'm not relying on my economy every time I rely on my economy it failed me every time I run on my backbend it failed me but when I went on my knees and I said Lord you send me your word I mustn't worry about what food I'm gonna eat what clothes I'm gonna wear I'm telling you this God never failed me amen [Applause] thank you and this councils of Supernatural Miracles yes that's the economy of God Amen you know the one time there was a case at work there was this a lady at work it was a it was a black lady and she had to wear a maternity dress when a woman wear at the time she's nine months pregnant that's how big her stomach was but she was not pregnant they did every scan you can think of they couldn't find anything so the people was telling me after what song are you having a baby or something he said no this is a problem I have a problem I said no that's a demon Spirit yes someone has Bewitched you so we went I took her in the presence of all the people there I just pray I'm going to pray for you I made a confession whatever costume that you had and I cast out that spirit in the name of Jesus Amen within a few days that woman was back to normal amen every time she sees me now she still speaks of the day the testimony and he was a witness by not one person two people there was quite a few people there amen and they also asked they said no we will when you're praying we will be happy that you'll pray I even asked the first do you want me to preacher said yes pray for me and I asked you to confess the sins first and those people were there Witnesses that's the god that we serve amen you've got to recognize this as much as the Holy Spirit wants to possess our vessels Satan want to possess vessels as well yes but the holy spirit is not like Satan say the holy spirit is a gentleman yes he'll want you to invite he means amen amen he wouldn't forcefully come into you amen right and that's why you find that we were scattered abroad into living in all kinds of things not knowing where we come from not knowing what our father is because we were taken from our heritage amen we was deprived of our true economy living under Satan's Eden amen and without the Holy Ghost your life will be miserable yes let me tell you something young man young people if you ever want to find a partner make sure they got the Holy Ghost yes brother Adrian gave the illustration one plus one is equals to one that equation can only work with Holy Ghost plus Holy Ghost amen amen if it's not only goes plus not and without Holy Ghost and Holy Ghost you're gonna have one plus and Legion of demon you don't know what you're facing you don't know how many demons you're facing there yeah you have to marry your own yes amen if you want to stay under your father's economy from your father's house amen say Gabriel and to send Elisa yes to go find a wife Isaac from his own yes amen marry your own stay within your own amen and also keep the inheritance within the tribe amen keep the inheritance within the tribe you want to say with your spiritual blessing he's blessed us with every spiritual blessing keep your inheritance within the tribe yes because God has given unique Ministries in the body of Christ and every part of the body has a part to do I'm sure you're God's economy now God wants to work with his body in his economy because God is ready to set up his kingdom now amen there's no way else there's nothing else left for this Earth in the Kingdom of of this world now Satan has come and is being celebrated right now but the kingdoms of Daniel's prophecy must be come to pass amen where the king the Gentile Kingdom must End Amen yes the Gentiles kingdom are soon coming to doom and the gospel must go to the Jews and the and the Gentile bride must leave the Earth yes amen but God is working with his own right now yes amen and he wants to he wants to do that perfect work amongst us this is a quick short work it's not a long work we don't have much time left here yes yes because you can see the the why is now in Hawaii is now advancing but not one nuclear bomb is going to fall as long as we are yeah amen yes but they got the bombs they got the Vatican Mark there and they got America back there because it was dusting the Lord that's why you say watch Russia watch Russia watch Russia you can't be saying you're a Believer and you're not watching what the prophet has told you yes yes these things are happening and you're living a normal life when God wants you to be blessed with all spiritual blessings amen God wants you to enjoy the benefits of his economy that's why we have the harness of the Holy Spirits amen he's showing us listen you you asking God for finance right now you are relying on finance because Finance money if you take money you take physical money it's made of the material of the earth you want to be technical say no my money is an account I work online right online devices all those things were made from things of the Earth the antennas the satellites all were made from things of the Earth right so if you are lying on that and you want that money to come why don't you go to the creator of the material of the Earth they're created the way that money can come through amen why why you want to look at and trying to find it to the way Satan the economy works because he is the God of this evil age you don't believe that you offered it to Jesus yes he said I'll give you all these kingdoms of the world I'll give you all these things okay let's let's take it more Into the Now the very people that you admire your Hollywood stars those singers those big soccer stars those rich people of the world do you know for them to be popular they have to sacrifice what am I talking about they have to make a pact with Satan they have to give their souls to the devil they have to trade their soul into the devil for them to become a superstar that's right for them to become popular they can't have that without giving something without sacrifice and that's why didn't you say that to Jesus bow down to me and I will give you that he's the God of this evil age in Daniel's time he didn't Bow Down he stood for his God yes but these people that are up there because if you're not if you don't sign this pact and don't come into the system they will not make you popular they will use what they control which is the media and so forth to bring you right down you don't join the system they'll put you right down but they can make you popular maybe you don't even sing good but they can make you a star they can make you a superstar amen they got because it's Satan's age yes Satan can do that but it's gonna make your life miserable that's why you find Muslim people getting to drugs to run away from these things because they don't know what to do after the life is given they have to keep giving and giving and then eventually when their body can't take it anymore on their own and Satan bashes them yeah for drugs because they can't take it anymore after he uses they're like an abused woman you know when a woman is used and ravished That's what Satan does and that's what he does to these churches as well they got everything on the outside but maybe you need to go look at what's on the inside yes don't look at someone outside glowing that's why when you see a son and daughter that's full of the holy spirit of God and many people see people the ministry take you up and follow the God and people lust after that they just want to come by the pulpit but they don't realize they took a sacrifice yes yeah yes they all go and see these people to come into God's economy they have to sacrifice the time in dedication people let's see people preaching and say oh I can be like that I can just go preach it doesn't work that way that's right you see a person praying for the sick and Supernatural things are taking place but they don't realize how much time it took in fasting and prayer how much alone time it took with God amen you see when you walk in God's economy your spiritual senses are illuminated and when your spiritual sins is illuminated you can walk talk to a person and you can see the demon Spirit through the person yeah amen and so will that demon Spirit recognize you if you're a son and daughter of God that demon Spirit recognize you and will not even look into you and want to keep away from you what I'm talking about go and go to somebody and you just do a test and you know that someone you you since they got the spirit on them go and speak the word open the words with him and see how long your lovely family members that you love to spend time with yes when they come to your house go and give them the word and see how they'll sit with you because they can't Satan can't take the word yes but when you are now living in God's economy you can see this thing but you see the carnival men can't see that yeah yeah John 14 25 says these things have I spoken unto you being prayer yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things amen and bring all things to your remembrance I give unto you not as the world giversity you see Satan wants to give you temporary blessing that he will take away after you give yourself to him and he'll throw you away but when you come to God he will give you the true blessing amen give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid yes amen he can't be afraid because when you walk on the perfect love perfect love casted away all fear amen but to have this to be in this economy you must come under sonship yes and to cover the sunship you have to walk in love amen you have to walk in forgiveness to come in sonship you have to be a servant it comes with servant to it in other words you are doing things for the kingdom you are kingdom-minded because you realize that you are subject of his domain amen we are subject of his domain because then you

right amen hallelujah you know in a message the world is falling apart he says there's only one thing will satisfy that's when Christ comes into a man's life for he is made in the image of God Amen and he's made in the Statue of God and God didn't give you this trip here on Earth to be this that or the other but to be a son and daughter of God and there's nothing else will satisfy amen that is why when you were in Amnesia outside the opening of the word outside the Holy Ghost you had a miserable life because you're trying to find your true Heritage amen you're trying to find where you

know I care to know about is the blessings of the Holy Ghost and mechanics he works them that's his secret this boy could not be healed because the disciples had power Jesus gave him power to heal all men of sickness to cast out Devils to cleanse the lepers and to raise the dead and he gave him power but they didn't have faith to operate that they had and then they questioned Jesus said well now why couldn't we do that and you know what Jesus give them the answer these didn't come by fast again prayer yes so he's taking him back to the sacrifice because Jesus came and showed servant to it he came and showed that he was here on the earth the temple of God dwelling on the Earth but it come with sacrifice he had to go and separate himself right yes he was among the public and he wants among
