[0:32] father. Amen. And the Bible teaches us
[0:35] that we need to count the goodness of
[0:37] God. Amen. We ought to be able to
[0:39] appreciate him. And you know, as Sunday
[0:41] school says, count your blessings. Name
[0:44] them one by one. Don't group them
[0:46] together because when you start to name
[0:48] them, you'll realize how good God has
[0:50] been to us. Amen. And yes, most of the
[0:54] time we only appreciate our good health
[0:56] when we are sick.
[0:58] And we say, "Lord, all this time you
[1:00] kept me in good health." Amen. And most
[1:02] of the time we appreciate our finances
[1:04] when we in lack. But in the good times,
[1:07] praise his name. In the bad times, do
[1:09] the same. In everything give the King of
[1:12] Kings all the thanks. Amen. So we pray,
[1:15] Amen, that you are blessed and rejoicing
[1:16] in the Lord. We have the most glorious
[1:18] message of the hour to be rejoicing
[1:20] around enough spiritual food in due
[1:22] season to keep us sustained in the time
[1:24] of famine. Amen. So, we're appreciating
[1:27] the Lord for what he's doing for us.
[1:28] Amen. Want to welcome, Amen. our brother

[1:52] this church. Amen. Ezra is now 5 years
[1:54] old. The Lord's been good to him. Was it
[1:56] him that was winning some races
[1:57] recently? Was it him? Hey, he's a good
[2:00] guy. Come win some races for Jesus, boy.
[2:04] Amen. We all running a race. So, we pray
[2:05] the Lord will continue to be with them
[2:07] and bless them. Amen. We also have Amen.
[2:10] You You were already blessed with sister
[2:12] Zoe Kusani. Amen. How many of you are
[2:15] blessed with the singing? Amen. We
[2:16] appreciate the singing. This is the
[2:18] daughter, youngest daughter of brother
[2:20] Andel Kasani. Is it Andel? Right.
[2:23] Kasani. You remember pastor Kasani?
[2:25] Amen. That's his youngest daughter, Zoe.
[2:28] So, formerly from PE, now currently
[2:32] residing here in Cestri Park, but dad.
[2:35] Amen. Pastor Kasani. Uh, Amen. asked her
[2:38] to come and fellowship here for a while.
[2:40] She'll be here for a little while. She's
[2:41] studying. Amen. So, she'll I want you to
[2:43] make her feel comfortable. Amen. Talk to
[2:46] her. Find out about her. Amen. Invite
[2:47] her to your home if you need to. Amen.

[2:56] the word of the Lord. Amen. So enjoy
[2:58] your time of fellowship while you are
[2:59] here with us. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[3:02] Also glad to have sister Devi back.
[3:03] Amen. She was in hospital for a week.
[3:06] Amen. And uh they managed to find out
[3:09] what was wrong with her and treated her
[3:10] for that. But we know that doctors can
[3:13] find symptoms and have medicines to
[3:16] assist us. But any good doctor will tell
[3:18] you it's only God that does the healing.
[3:20] Amen. Amen. So we want to thank our Lord
[3:21] and Savior Jesus Christ for touching our
[3:24] dear sister and for healing her. Amen.
[3:26] Praise the Lord. She was telling me,
[3:28] Amen, she didn't have a need for any
[3:29] operation or anything. So she was really
[3:31] grateful for that. And she was telling
[3:33] me that she will give a testimony next
[3:34] week. So we appreciate her. Amen. We'll
[3:36] give her time to recover fully. Amen.
[3:38] Praise the Lord. Lord. Amen. And also
[3:41] remember brother Jared. Amen. The
[3:43] youngest boy. Amen. The mom and dad also
[3:45] have a desire for him to be back in the
[3:47] house of fellowship. Amen. So we just
[3:49] continue to pray for him. How many of
[3:50] you will pray for him? Amen. Hallelujah.
[3:53] You know sometimes we only regard people
[3:55] that are physically we can see with our
[3:57] eyes as part of the body. But what in
[3:59] case a finger is missing? And it's not
[4:02] physically here that we need to pray
[4:04] that the entire body comes together.
[4:06] Amen. Amen. And that's what we are
[4:08] praying. We are starting to see even as
[4:10] we start to pray and ask even the angels
[4:12] of God, amen, to go forth and we are
[4:15] speaking what Jesus said. All that the
[4:17] father has given me will come to me.
[4:19] Amen. And I believe even here in this
[4:21] local ministry, all that the father has
[4:23] given us will come to us. Amen. And we
[4:26] will by by no means cast any one of them
[4:28] out. Amen.
[4:31] Unless we can speak like Jesus. Amen.
[4:34] Speak back the words that he spoke. So
[4:36] we're really thankful. Amen. To have
[4:38] Amen. our brothers and sisters with us
[4:40] here this morning.
[4:42] And also, Amen. We have our special
[4:44] guest, our Pastor Jonathan, Sister
[4:46] Tammy. Let's give them a hand. Amen.
[4:48] Welcome them in the house of the Lord.
[4:50] Amen. No strangers to us. Amen. And been
[4:55] good friends with us for many many
[4:56] years. I remember many years ago I was
[4:59] still pastor Jonathan at that time was
[5:01] in charge of the youth and I was in
[5:03] charge of youth. We used to meet up and
[5:04] sister Tammy made a comment. I don't
[5:06] know if she remember. She says these
[5:07] guys have such a big age difference but
[5:09] I don't know why they are friends. You
[5:11] know
[5:13] maybe she thought I was younger than I
[5:15] look. Hey, I'm 46. I'm not that young.
[5:21] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, Amen. So,
[5:23] coming, you know, from the youth
[5:24] ministry into pastoring now, uh, dear
[5:26] Pastor Jonathan has been ordained the
[5:28] pastor since July 2023. Amen. Taking,
[5:32] uh, the ministry forward from Pastor Dan
[5:34] Naidu. If you don't know this, he's
[5:35] pastor Dan Naidu's eldest. He's the
[5:37] elder son. Elder son. Amen. Praise the
[5:39] Lord. So, we're looking forward and we,
[5:42] he always invites us. Very gracious.
[5:43] Amen. asks us to come share the word of
[5:45] the Lord there. And I'm a firm believer
[5:48] that the church is not perfected by the
[5:49] pastor alone.
[5:52] Amen. If I preach here every day from
[5:54] now till the rapture, you will not be
[5:56] perfected because I'll be going against
[5:59] scripture. Scripture says the five-fold
[6:01] ministry perfects the church. So from
[6:04] time to time, you'll see us inviting
[6:05] ministers to come to edify the body of
[6:08] Christ and strengthen us in those areas
[6:10] that we need strengthening. Amen. And
[6:12] it's for the benefit of the body. Once
[6:14] you see a pastor stopping ministries
[6:16] from coming, telling you not to
[6:17] associate with other ministries, telling
[6:19] you not to join the combined meetings,
[6:21] telling you not to join the Easter
[6:22] conventions, run for your life. Amen.
[6:25] Tell your neighbor run.
[6:28] Praise the Lord. Because that is
[6:30] becoming cultish.
[6:32] Amen. So the five-fold ministry is for
[6:34] the unity of the saints. For the
[6:36] perfection of the saints. Amen. So
[6:38] that's what we aim to do here. Amen. So
[6:41] we welcome you, Pastor Jonathan. Pray
[6:43] the Lord will use you mightily this
[6:45] morning to share and minister the word
[6:47] of the Lord. From what I know, our dear
[6:49] pastor, Amen. He's he's a more of a
[6:51] teacher of the word. Amen. That's where
[6:54] he he finds his calling in. So we we
[6:57] under expectation for that. Uh also he
[6:59] was asked him how long he is married and
[7:01] he said for 38 years. Amen. And that's a
[7:05] good example to everyone else. Amen.
[7:08] Because the world today thinks nothing
[7:10] of marriages. They just think nothing of
[7:12] separation and divorce. But we remember
[7:16] what the Lord says. Whatsoever God had
[7:18] joined together, let no man put us
[7:22] under. And remember when you took your
[7:24] vow, you said until death do we part.
[7:27] Amen. Praise the Lord. I know some of
[7:29] you can't wait to see the dead day.
[7:33] Amen. But I want to remind you what the
[7:35] prophet says. He said we were from
[7:38] eternity.
[7:39] We stepped out into space of time. Amen.
[7:43] And he says we will return back to
[7:45] eternity. I know some of you when you
[7:47] get to heaven, you're going to be
[7:48] running far away from the other one
[7:49] saying, "Please don't come anywhere near
[7:50] me." Amen. Praise the Lord. I pray the
[7:53] Lord changes it here now. Amen. Praise
[7:55] the Lord. We'll have good marriages,
[7:57] strong marriages for the kingdom of God.
[8:00] Amen. Marriage is ordained of God. So,
[8:02] we're thankful for that. Amen. How many
[8:04] of you are ready for the word of the
[8:05] Lord? Amen. Amen. Also want to remind
[8:07] you, I'm telling you early enough, the
[8:09] last Sunday of the month is the it's the
[8:11] 29th of June. So, we are restarting the
[8:15] combined meetings, the local combined
[8:17] meetings. Amen. We didn't have it for a
[8:19] while because uh I I was telling you
[8:22] that the mult monthly contributions that
[8:24] we put we were saving it for the Easter
[8:26] convention. So, we didn't want to take
[8:28] on any unnecessary cost until we had
[8:30] sorted the Easter convention out. So now
[8:32] that that is taken care of the one of
[8:35] the vision and the goal of the local
[8:37] ministers is to unite the body of Christ
[8:39] without any divisions. Amen. So we
[8:42] decided one of the ways is that once a
[8:44] month we will meet as a combined group
[8:46] of believers in Durban.
[8:48] Amen. So the combined meeting will be at
[8:50] the Durban girls secondary school. Amen.
[8:52] At 4 p.m. Tell your neighbor you are
[8:55] invited. Now really tell tell them tell
[8:57] them you are invited because you know
[8:59] you know it's a mystery sometimes the
[9:01] pastor announces something in church and
[9:03] you ask them they'll say I never ever
[9:05] heard that.
[9:07] I never hear the pastor saying that.
[9:09] It's happened so many times. Amen. So
[9:12] remember Durban Girl Secondary School
[9:14] 400 p.m. on the 29th of June. How many
[9:17] of you will make a commitment now? Clear
[9:19] your schedules and start to support
[9:21] these local meetings. Amen. because I
[9:25] even got told that sometimes you come
[9:27] alone
[9:30] but I'm making the announcements here
[9:33] and please you know it's very
[9:35] embarrassing when they tell you things
[9:36] like that and I don't know if most of
[9:38] you aware I'm telling you not for any
[9:40] clout or anything uh we had the pastor's
[9:43] meeting two weeks ago and I was elected
[9:45] as the chairman of the pastors the local
[9:47] ministers to coordinate things now
[9:49] please don't let me down
[9:52] how they going to say it the chairman
[9:53] now is people are not coming.
[9:57] You know, it's it'll be a very poor
[9:59] reflection. Amen. So, praise the Lord.
[10:01] But come more for the word of God. Have
[10:03] develop that hunger for the word of God
[10:05] and start to Amen. appreciate these
[10:07] things. You'll find we we'll start to
[10:09] try and get more combined youth meetings
[10:11] going on and trying to facilitate better
[10:13] programs for us. Amen. To unite the body
[10:15] of Christ in Durban. So pray for that as
[10:17] well because anything that's we're
[10:19] trying to move forward for the things of
[10:20] God, Satan will try and counter those
[10:22] things. Amen. So I don't want to take
[10:25] much more time. Uh let's stand together
[10:27] even as we invite our dear pastor
[10:28] Jonathan to come forward and minister
[10:30] what the Lord has placed on his heart
[10:32] and we will be ready to receive it.
[10:34] Amen. By faith. Praise the Lord.
[10:39] Let's sing. I've come expecting Jesus.
[10:42] I've come expecting God. Amen. Remember,
[10:45] it's based on expectation. This morning,
[10:48] if we can say, Lord, speak to me. I come
[10:50] hungry. I come thirsty.
[10:53] I've come expecting Jesus.
[10:59] Come expecting God.
[11:01] I've come expecting God.
[11:06] Sweetest Holy Spirit.
[11:09] Sweetest Holy Spirit.
[11:14] I'm desperate for your touch. I'm
[11:17] desperate for your touch.
[11:21] Say, Lord, I know you are more than
[11:22] able. I know you're more than able
[11:28] to meet me in this place.
[11:31] To meet me in this place. I've come
[11:36] expecting Jesus.
[11:38] I've come expecting Jesus.
[11:43] Come expecting God. I've come expecting
[11:48] God.
[11:50] I've come expecting Jesus.
[11:53] I've come expecting Jesus.
[11:57] I've come expecting God. Amen. Over to
[12:00] our dear Pastor Jonathan.
[12:04] Praise the Lord. See my Lord.
[12:09] Holy Spirit,
[12:12] [Music]
[12:14] I'm desperate for your
[12:17] [Music]
[12:22] I know you more than he
[12:29] to be this.
[12:33] [Music]
[12:36] I've come expecting Jesus.
[12:43] I've come expecting God.
[12:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Surely, Father,
[12:51] we come expecting Jesus. Lord, we didn't
[12:55] come to see any man. We didn't come to
[12:57] see any flesh of God that can boast
[13:00] about himself. We come to see Jesus
[13:03] Christ uh veiled in human flesh. The
[13:07] voice that is speaking must be you,
[13:09] Father. And that's what we want to hear,
[13:11] Lord. Your voice this morning, we pray
[13:14] as I healed myself to you that the Holy
[13:17] Spirit would speak, oh God, blessing
[13:20] your people, bringing them up to that
[13:22] level where they can hear from you,
[13:25] Lord, in the spirit. Lord, John had to
[13:27] leave the church ages. He had to be
[13:30] caught up higher into the level, oh God,
[13:32] of heavenly places. And when he was
[13:34] picked up into that level, then he began
[13:36] to see things like he never saw before.
[13:39] And I pray, oh God, that you'll give
[13:41] your people grace to come up to that
[13:43] level on the Lord's day. Oh God, where
[13:46] they can hear you speak, oh God, we
[13:48] thank you, Lord, that you made a way for
[13:50] us through redemption. Oh God, we seen
[13:52] our man had fallen. Oh God, from you
[13:55] Lord Jesus in the beginning sin had come
[13:57] into the land oh God and Father you you
[14:01] said Lord you need a slain lamb father
[14:04] and every every year they would come
[14:06] with the sacrifices before you Lord to
[14:09] make it Lord and say Lord forgive us for
[14:11] our sins but the desire remained in the
[14:14] heart father the consciousness was
[14:17] always there father but Lord we thank
[14:19] you Lord 2,000 years ago you came and
[14:23] paid the Christ, oh God, once and for
[14:26] all. Oh God, you set us free from sin
[14:29] and the desire of sin, Lord Jesus. Now,
[14:32] Lord, we can say we are redeemed
[14:34] children of God. And in this end time,
[14:36] you come again, Father, to claim your
[14:39] bride and bring her, oh God, into the
[14:41] position of Jesus Christ, so that we
[14:44] could be ready for a rapture. Oh God,
[14:46] bless this church. Bless the pastor,
[14:49] Pastor Adrian. Oh God, undertake for
[14:51] him. Strengthen him. Give him the
[14:52] strength to lead the church. Oh God, we
[14:55] can't do it on our own efforts, Lord,
[14:57] but we want to be led by the Holy
[14:59] Spirit. We pray that you'll bless his
[15:01] family, too. Bless the leoty members, oh
[15:04] God, and the ministers that minister in
[15:06] this church, our precious brother Joshua
[15:08] also, Lord, and all the other ministers
[15:11] that I don't know that are ministering.
[15:13] We pray that you'd bless them and bless
[15:15] the people also. those that are sick
[15:17] this morning, those that are going
[15:19] through financial difficulties, those
[15:21] that are going through difficulties that
[15:23] we don't understand. Father, in the name
[15:25] of Jesus, we claim the healing. We claim
[15:28] the victory. We claim, oh God, whatever
[15:31] the desire is that you'd give it to them
[15:34] by faith, we accept it and know that
[15:36] you're going to make a way for your
[15:38] bride. Lord, bless us now and undertake
[15:40] for this service in Jesus name. Amen and
[15:44] amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[15:46] If we can turn to our Bibles,
[15:51] Revelations chapter 21 and verse one.
[15:55] Revelations 21 and verse one.
[16:04] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[16:08] And I saw a new heaven and a new heart
[16:11] for the first heaven and the first earth
[16:14] were passed away. And there was no more
[16:16] sea. Amen. Amen. So the sea is going to
[16:19] be demolished. Going to be annihilated.
[16:22] Amen. And the new heaven and the new
[16:24] earth is going to be a completely new
[16:26] place. Amen. Amen. Remember this is this
[16:30] didn't exist before, but it existed in
[16:33] God's mind. So it has to come to pass.
[16:36] Amen. And I, John, saw the holy city,
[16:40] New Jerusalem, coming down from God out
[16:42] of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned
[16:45] for her husband. Amen. So there's a
[16:49] twofold in that as we see God is
[16:51] preparing his city. Amen. Coming down on
[16:54] the earth, this new city. Amen. Is the
[16:56] same example of the bride on earth and
[17:00] Christ coming and sealing his bride with
[17:02] the capstone. Amen. the um the parallel
[17:06] there
[17:08] in verse three. And I and I heard a
[17:11] great voice out of heaven saying,
[17:12] "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with
[17:15] men. And he will dwell with them, and
[17:18] they shall be his people, and God
[17:21] himself shall be with them, and be their
[17:24] God." Amen. Isn't that wonderful? Amen.
[17:26] That's what exactly happened in our day.
[17:28] Amen. God came and made himself one with
[17:31] man.
[17:34] Heaven and earth must embrace. Amen. And
[17:37] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[17:40] eyes, and there shall be no more death.
[17:43] Aren't we waiting for that day? Amen.
[17:45] Where there's going to be no more death,
[17:47] no more crying, no more pain, no more
[17:49] sorrows. Amen. It's all going to be
[17:51] gone.
[17:54] Neither sorrow nor crying. Neither shall
[17:56] there be any more pain. For the former
[17:59] things are passed away. They passed
[18:02] away. There's no more remembrance of
[18:03] them. It's done away with. Amen. And he
[18:06] that sat upon the throne said, "Behold,
[18:08] I make all things new." Amen. Can you
[18:11] see that? All things new. Amen. And he
[18:14] said unto me, "Write, for these words
[18:17] are true and faithful." Amen. And he
[18:20] said unto unto me, "It is done. I am
[18:22] Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
[18:25] end. I will give unto him that is a
[18:29] thirst of the fountain of the water of
[18:31] life freely. Amen. Amen. God has
[18:34] provided that water for us in this day.
[18:37] And in that new city, there is going to
[18:39] be a fountain of water, a stream that
[18:42] runs from the throne all the way down.
[18:45] He that overcomemeth shall inherit all
[18:48] things.
[18:49] He that overcomemeth, amen, the
[18:51] denominational systems,
[18:54] he that overcomemeth the world. Amen.
[18:56] All the things that we are facing in
[18:58] this world, when we overcome those
[19:00] things, amen, what will happen? And I
[19:03] will be his God and he shall be my son.
[19:08] Amen. Amen. So the rest of the scripture
[19:10] that I'm going to read, I think you'd
[19:11] rather be seated. Amen. Amen.
[19:16] And then we'll go to second Peter
[19:18] chapter 3. Second Peter chapter 3 and
[19:22] verse 5.
[19:30] For this they willingly are ignorant of
[19:33] that by the word of God the heavens were
[19:35] of old and the earth standing out of the
[19:38] water and in the water. Now that is the
[19:42] when God created the heavens and the
[19:44] earth. Amen. When he created everything,
[19:46] Amen. the waters and the land, he
[19:49] separated it. And he moved some of the
[19:52] water into the atmosphere and he moved
[19:54] some of the water into the sea. Amen.
[19:58] And he made land, right? That was of the
[20:00] old. Then verse six, whereby the world
[20:05] that then was being overflowed with
[20:07] water perished. That is Noah's time.
[20:10] Amen. The earth was perished and it was
[20:12] overflowing water flooding. Amen. That
[20:15] was Noah's time. But the heavens and the
[20:17] earth which are now by the same word are
[20:20] kept in store, reserved unto fire
[20:23] against the day of judgment and pition
[20:26] of ungodly men. See, so there's a time
[20:30] coming, amen, in the future where God is
[20:33] going to destroy this earth with fire.
[20:35] Yes. Amen. Not very long from now. All
[20:38] right.
[20:39] But behold, be not ignorant of this one
[20:42] thing, that one day is with the Lord as
[20:45] a thousand years, and a thousand years
[20:47] as one day. We know that speaks of the
[20:50] millennium. Amen. One day with the Lord
[20:53] is a thousand year years. That day that
[20:57] you eat off that fruit, that's the day
[20:59] you'll die. Amen. So, Adam never make
[21:03] that thousand years. He died before that
[21:05] day. Amen. Nobody made that thousand
[21:07] years. So God's going to give it back to
[21:09] us a thousand years. Amen. The
[21:11] millennium.
[21:14] Um
[21:16] right.
[21:18] But behold, be not ignorant of this one
[21:20] thing that one day is with the Lord as a
[21:22] thousand years and a thousand years as
[21:23] one day. The Lord is not slack
[21:25] concerning his promise as some men count
[21:28] slackness, but he's longsuffering to us
[21:31] would, not willing that any should
[21:33] perish, but that all should come to
[21:36] repentance. So there's going to be a
[21:39] burning of the earth. Amen. And God is
[21:42] saying, I don't want anyone to perish.
[21:45] And brother Brandham says, man pushes
[21:48] himself into hell. Man pushes himself to
[21:51] be killed. Amen. because of sin. So he
[21:55] doesn't want anyone to be perish. He
[21:56] doesn't want anyone to perish, but he
[21:58] wants everyone to be saved. But it it
[22:01] depends on you. Amen. Verse 10. But the
[22:05] day of the Lord will come as a thief in
[22:07] the night in the which the heavens shall
[22:10] pass away with a great noise, and the
[22:12] elements shall melt with fever and eat.
[22:15] The earth also, and the works that that
[22:18] are therein shall be burnt up. So
[22:21] everything that you see on the earth is
[22:23] going to be burnt up. Every single thing
[22:26] is going to be burnt up. Amen. There's
[22:28] nothing going to stand before God.
[22:31] Seeing then that all these things shall
[22:33] be dissolved. You know when you take
[22:35] sugar and you put it in tea and you turn
[22:37] it. Amen. Can you find that sugar after
[22:40] you turn it for a while? You don't find
[22:43] it. Amen. So that's the word dissolved.
[22:46] It's going to be dissolved. Everything
[22:47] is going to be dissolved. What manner of
[22:50] persons are Jay to be in all holy
[22:52] conversation and and godliness
[22:56] as the time is getting closer. Amen. We
[22:59] should be getting more desperate as we
[23:02] can see the world in the condition that
[23:03] it is and we know that this is the end
[23:06] times. We can see the serious hour that
[23:09] we're living in. Yet people seem to be
[23:11] enjoying themselves more with the world
[23:14] than to get closer to God. That's what
[23:15] the Bible is saying that we should get
[23:17] more desperate. Is that right?
[23:22] Looking for and hasting unto the coming
[23:24] of the day of God, wherein the heavens
[23:26] being on fire shall be dissolved, and
[23:29] the elements shall melt with fever and
[23:31] eat. Nevertheless, we according to his
[23:34] promise look for a new heavens and a new
[23:38] heart wherein dwell righteousness.
[23:42] There's no unrighteousness there.
[23:44] There's no fake believers there. There's
[23:46] only genuine believers that are going to
[23:49] be on that side. Amen.
[23:52] I greet every one of you in the precious
[23:53] and wonderful name of Jesus Christ. And
[23:56] I'm sure you was hoping when I'm going
[23:57] to greet you.
[23:59] Amen. We appreciate the Lord for uh the
[24:03] invite for from Pastor Adrien Genan
[24:06] allowing me to preach at the church here
[24:09] today. and uh I pray that God would give
[24:12] me grace to preach to you that you may
[24:15] understand and uh that you may receive
[24:19] with a spiritual ear. Yes. Not with the
[24:21] natural years that you hear but with a
[24:24] spiritual year. And sometimes it looks
[24:26] like we contradict ourselves, you know,
[24:30] like um I was saying something on
[24:33] Wednesday and I said something after the
[24:36] church to the people and my wife said,
[24:39] "You contradicted yourself." I said,
[24:41] "Yes, I contradicted myself naturally,
[24:45] but spiritually I know what I meant."
[24:47] You see, and sometimes, brother
[24:49] Brandham, when you read these messages,
[24:51] it looks like it's contradicting. And
[24:53] you hear one thing the prophet says
[24:55] here, and you hear something else, it
[24:57] looks like it's there, and it looks
[24:59] different, and you don't know what to
[25:00] believe. Amen. I believe our prophet had
[25:02] a a thought. And you got to catch the
[25:05] thought more than what has been said.
[25:08] Sometimes we say things and you don't
[25:09] catch the thought. The thought is very,
[25:12] very important. It's not how much I can
[25:14] say to you, it's how much you can catch
[25:16] what I'm saying to you. Amen. So, it's
[25:18] very very important what I am saying to
[25:20] you today. So, um I appreciate the
[25:23] church uh also having me here and may
[25:26] the Lord bless this church and may your
[25:29] ministry be fruitful. Gen. Amen. So my
[25:33] title is um the title message that I'm
[25:36] busy with which normally I run as a
[25:39] series as pastor Adrien says my ministry
[25:42] I run generally as a series. So if one
[25:45] has to listen to me it has to be a year
[25:47] at least before you know what I'm
[25:49] talking about. All right. So I'm
[25:51] generally a long preacher but I'll try
[25:53] to be as reasonable as possible. Amen.
[25:56] The title is the future of the heavenly
[25:58] bridegroom and the earthly bride. Amen.
[26:02] Yes, the future home of the heavenly
[26:04] bridegroom and the earthly bride. But my
[26:10] uh subtitle is the process of the
[26:14] sealing of the Holy Ghost. Amen. The
[26:17] process of the sealing of the Holy
[26:20] Ghost. Amen. So in Romans chapter 2 and
[26:23] verse 28, I'll have a bit of the quotes
[26:26] on the screen for you so you can follow
[26:28] there instead of you keep opening your
[26:30] Bible.
[26:31] For he is not a Jew which is one
[26:35] outwardly, neither is that circumcision
[26:39] which is outward in the flesh. But he is
[26:42] a Jew which is one inwardly. Yes. And
[26:47] circumcision is that of the art in the
[26:50] spirit and not in letter whose praise is
[26:53] not of men but of God. Yes.
[26:56] So yeah, the scripture is saying now you
[26:59] know what when we look at people we see
[27:02] that they look message people they look
[27:05] believers. Amen. But God is not looking
[27:08] at the outside. He's looking at what has
[27:11] taken place on the inside. Amen. The
[27:14] process of where you have come to. Amen.
[27:18] Have you reached the stage where you are
[27:20] circumcised in the heart? Amen. Not a
[27:23] outward circumcision but a inward
[27:25] circumcision. This is where I find
[27:28] people like to make a outward show.
[27:31] Amen. They live the message outwardly.
[27:34] They talk high about the message. Amen.
[27:37] It's kind of a proud spirit. Amen. That
[27:40] they have some people in the message
[27:43] they have this proud spirit about them.
[27:45] You know they are the message people.
[27:48] Amen. But inwardly they lack the Holy
[27:51] Ghost. Yes. Jesus said, "Unless your
[27:54] righteousness exceeds
[27:56] the righteousness of the Pharisees and
[27:59] Sadducees." The Pharisees and Sadducees
[28:01] had it all outwardly. If you saw them,
[28:04] they lived a life that was so perfect
[28:07] that you couldn't even find a fault in
[28:09] on their lives. Amen. They always
[28:11] criticized people. They always found
[28:13] faults on people. Amen. They live
[28:15] perfectly outwardly. But they lack
[28:18] something. They didn't have a inward
[28:20] change. They didn't have a change in the
[28:23] heart. And that's what we want to talk
[28:25] about today. Amen. A change in the
[28:27] heart. You're not fooling God. You're
[28:30] fooling man. Amen. God knows your heart.
[28:34] Man may praise you, but your folly will
[28:37] be made known sooner or later. Amen.
[28:40] Amen. Let's all be serious about the
[28:42] gospel. And I I mean that. Amen. Let's
[28:46] all be serious about the gospel. I've
[28:47] been telling our church also to start
[28:50] getting serious. When I say serious, it
[28:52] doesn't mean now you must start fasting
[28:54] every day and praying every day. Amen.
[28:57] But I'm saying get closer to God. Get
[29:00] into the messages. Amen. That's where
[29:02] you get closer. Get into the messages.
[29:04] Read the Bible often as you can. Pray as
[29:07] often as you can. Always see God. And
[29:11] don't worry about your brother's
[29:14] situation in a sense where you mind his
[29:16] business and you want to gossip about
[29:18] him or your sister. Leave them alone and
[29:21] worry about your own life. Amen. We all
[29:23] need to get closer to God in our own
[29:25] lives. Don't worry about how close he
[29:27] can get. Worry about how close you can
[29:30] get. Amen. Is that right? And we always
[29:32] like to clean our neighbors yard. We
[29:34] forget to clean ours. Amen. So, let's
[29:37] not do that. Let's seriously look at our
[29:40] lives personally ourselves. Amen. Where
[29:43] are we failing God? Where how close can
[29:46] we get? Amen. So let's say we need God.
[29:51] All of us. We need God. Is that right?
[29:54] We don't want to pretend. We don't want
[29:57] to waste time in God's kingdom, but we
[29:59] want our sacrifices to be accepted by
[30:02] God. When you come to church every
[30:04] Sunday, you're singing and you're
[30:06] praising God. You want those things to
[30:08] be accepted by God. Amen. You don't want
[30:11] it to be vain worship. Is that right?
[30:14] Yes. So there's a process now. Not just
[30:18] a justification or a sanctification or a
[30:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost, but the
[30:24] sealing of the Holy Ghost in our hearts.
[30:27] Amen. How many wants that this morning?
[30:30] The sealing of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[30:33] Then coming to church will be not just a
[30:36] tradition. Yes, it'll become a reality.
[30:39] It'll be a fellowship with you and your
[30:41] maker. You and God becomes one. Amen.
[30:44] That's what God wants. He wants to have
[30:46] fellowship with you in your heart. Not
[30:49] in this church only. Fellowship in this
[30:51] church is good. Amen. But there's a more
[30:53] intimate fellowship that he wants to
[30:55] have in your soul. Hallelujah. Look at
[30:57] that more importantly today. Amen.
[30:59] Colossians chapter 2 and verse 11 say.
[31:02] So quite a bit of scriptures we got and
[31:04] quotations. Oh, that's the kind of
[31:05] preacher I am. Amen. Colossians chapter
[31:09] 2 and verse 11. In whom also ye are
[31:12] circumcised with the circumcision made
[31:15] without hands.
[31:18] There in the Old Testament, they had to
[31:20] circumcise the child. Yes. Amen. And
[31:24] they circumcised those children. Amen.
[31:27] And they knew that this child is part of
[31:29] God now. Amen. That was a physical
[31:32] circumcision. But God is requiring a
[31:35] inward circumcision one by the Holy
[31:37] Ghost. Amen. Not by your physical hands.
[31:42] See, in putting off the body of the sins
[31:46] of the flesh by the circumcision of
[31:49] Christ. You see verse 12, buried with
[31:52] him in baptism, wherein also ye are
[31:56] risen with him through the faith of the
[31:58] operation of God, who had raised him
[32:01] from the dead. Verse 13, and you being
[32:05] dead in your sins, and the
[32:08] uncircumcision of your flesh, and he
[32:10] quickened together with him, having
[32:13] forgiven you all trespasses.
[32:18] Amen. So when you finish off today and
[32:21] you go through the process and when you
[32:23] sealed with the Holy Ghost, Amen. then
[32:26] it means that you haven't sinned at all.
[32:29] Yes. Absolutely. It means that you're
[32:32] perfect. It means that you are sinless.
[32:34] Amen. It means that the devil cannot
[32:37] accuse you of sin anymore. You are
[32:40] cleared. That's why brother Brandon
[32:41] preached that message abstract. Abstract
[32:44] means he clears it all the way from the
[32:47] beginning. the time that you were born
[32:49] till today, it's all cleared. You never
[32:51] sinned in the first place. Amen. That's
[32:53] why God was requiring perfection. And
[32:57] perfection is nothing less than
[32:58] perfection. Perfection means that you
[33:01] never sinned in the first place. Is that
[33:03] right? But yet if I tell you that I
[33:05] sinned, would that look contradicting?
[33:09] Is that right? To the human mind, it'll
[33:11] look contradicting. We all sinners. We
[33:14] all born in sin and shaped in iniquity.
[33:16] You came into this world telling lies
[33:17] and just after I finish service I might
[33:19] just tell a lie.
[33:21] But does that make me a sinner? No, it
[33:23] doesn't make me a sinner. Amen. Because
[33:26] as long as God is in me, I'm not a
[33:28] sinner. Amen. Is that right? Yes.
[33:30] Because God has clean cleansed all the
[33:32] sin away, all the doubt. Amen. Because I
[33:34] believe in God. Amen. I don't believe in
[33:37] half off. If I believe fully in God,
[33:40] Amen. then I'm not a sinner. Amen. I'm
[33:42] glorified. Amen. I'm justified. Yes, I'm
[33:45] set free from sin. Amen.
[33:48] So let no man therefore judge you in
[33:50] meat or in drink or in respect of any
[33:53] holy day or of the new moon of the
[33:56] Sabbath days. See that's true. This is
[33:58] what we want to talk about today. We are
[34:01] far beyond message days,
[34:05] far beyond someone criticizing another
[34:08] person. This is the day where scripture
[34:12] is being fulfilled. Amen. Yes. Once upon
[34:14] a time it was prophecy. In the days of
[34:18] our prophet it was prophecy. He was
[34:20] prophesying. But everything that we see
[34:23] today is manifestation and reality of
[34:28] what he spoke. Amen. It's becoming
[34:30] reality. Is it right? So Christ doesn't
[34:34] criticize
[34:35] nor boast of himself but he has
[34:38] compassion and he loves to save the
[34:41] lost. Hallelujah. So, we're not going to
[34:43] stop with the saving the lost. We're
[34:45] going to still go out and do the
[34:46] outreach work. We're still going to go
[34:48] there and get people to God, get him to
[34:50] the get them to the message and let them
[34:52] get baptized and get saved. Amen. That
[34:55] will never stop till the rapture takes
[34:56] place. Amen. That's what we believe in.
[34:59] Amen.
[35:01] So, compassion on the lost, he doesn't
[35:03] look down on people. He doesn't pick on
[35:06] people. So, if you have Christ in you,
[35:09] then you will have his nature. Amen. And
[35:11] brother speaks about the divine nature
[35:14] which will produce the seven virtues.
[35:17] Amen. You cannot produce although the
[35:20] scripture says had to your faith virtue
[35:22] and from your va to from your virtue to
[35:24] knowledge and you think every day I'll
[35:26] wake up I'll add this to my life. So
[35:29] today I I'll be very patient on the
[35:31] road. When I drive I make sure I don't
[35:33] make a noise at any driver. I'll just be
[35:36] calm on the road. You're just making
[35:38] that up yourself. Christian science has
[35:40] more of that than we have. Amen. What we
[35:43] need is the divine nature. When the
[35:46] divine nature comes into you, it will
[35:49] add these things into your life. Amen.
[35:51] Where you don't live this yourself, but
[35:54] he lives it through you. Amen. So we
[35:57] going to go into the subject now, the
[36:00] future home.
[36:02] Amen. And the process to being sealed.
[36:05] Yes, we know that the earth has gone
[36:08] through justification. If we can just
[36:09] have the diagram please brother of the
[36:11] earth the five
[36:14] um okay so you can see the diagram here.
[36:18] Amen. So on the Can I use one of these
[36:20] sticks brother?
[36:25] Okay. Can I use the stickies? Okay. All
[36:28] right. So we see here that the earth was
[36:32] justified. Amen. In the time of Noah,
[36:36] yes, the earth went through a
[36:38] justification. Amen. Which was the
[36:40] flood. The flood had baptized the earth.
[36:43] And God cleansed the earth by baptism,
[36:46] which was justification. God started his
[36:48] process. Amen. Showing on the earth
[36:50] first before he started to do it in man.
[36:53] Yes. And then he sanctified there 2,000
[36:56] years later. He sanctifies the earth.
[36:59] Amen. By the blood of Jesus Christ.
[37:01] Amen. falling on the earth. When he went
[37:03] to Calvary, he cleansed that earth.
[37:06] That's the same soil. Amen. Those 16
[37:10] elements are part of your life.
[37:13] Yes. So, the process has started for
[37:16] your 16 elements. Yes. Your 16 elements.
[37:19] Now, don't talk about your soul. I'm
[37:20] talking about your 16 elements. Your 16
[37:23] elements is not purified yet. Your soul
[37:26] can be purified. Your soul can have God
[37:28] in it. But your 16 elements will fail.
[37:30] Absolutely. Your spirit will fail daily.
[37:33] Your your soul and your mind will fail.
[37:35] I mean your mind and your body will fail
[37:37] daily. Amen. But the soul can be sealed
[37:41] with God. So the earth is being cleansed
[37:44] now with his blood which is
[37:46] sanctification. That was 2,000 years.
[37:49] And now we are waiting for the burning
[37:50] of the earth. Yes. Amen. Which is the
[37:53] brimstone and fire that God is going to
[37:55] burn the earth in the next 2,000 years.
[37:57] Anytime soon that God is going to do
[37:59] that. Amen. He's going to burn the
[38:01] earth. But before that burning of the
[38:03] earth, there's going to be a tribulation
[38:04] period. A tribulation period, amen, of
[38:07] three and a half years where he's going
[38:09] to call out the Jews. Amen. And the
[38:11] Gentiles are going to be persecuted and
[38:14] there's going to be lots of things
[38:15] happen on the earth. And I believe right
[38:17] now we are ushering in to the
[38:20] tribulation and we are ushering in into
[38:22] eternal life. Amen. So the two usherings
[38:25] are taking place at the moment. And when
[38:28] God burns the earth, amen, in uh the
[38:30] next 2,000 years which is coming, amen,
[38:33] then he prepares it for the millennium.
[38:35] Yes. Now notice 2,00 2,000 2,000 is
[38:40] giving you 6,000.
[38:42] And the millennium is a 7,000. Yes.
[38:46] Amen. is your 7,000 that completes the
[38:50] program of God as the seventh speaks of
[38:56] the rest. Amen. Sabbath. Amen. But it is
[39:00] not eternal. Yes. Seven. On the seventh,
[39:03] it still speaks of time. Yes. Amen. The
[39:06] seventh is still in time because you're
[39:08] still going to have your watch. Yes. A
[39:10] thousand years with the Lord. Amen. Must
[39:13] be completed on the seventh. Yes. See,
[39:16] so we still have to have time. Amen.
[39:18] Only at the end of the 7,000 will there
[39:21] be another burning again where God will
[39:25] regenerate the earth. Yes. Explode the
[39:28] earth. Everything will be burnt and
[39:30] dissolved as we read in the scripture.
[39:32] And God will cleanse the earth and the
[39:34] soil will be changed upside down. Amen.
[39:39] Until he can now bring his new city
[39:42] down. Yes. So what is the final stage of
[39:46] the entire program of God? The final
[39:49] stage is when you are sealed with the
[39:52] Holy Ghost.
[39:55] Yes. Can you see that? You can go
[39:57] through justification. Yes. And you and
[39:59] you and the devil can still be in you.
[40:01] He can still work in your life and your
[40:03] soul can be dark as dark as anything.
[40:05] You can go through sanctification and
[40:07] your soul can still be dark. And you can
[40:09] go through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:11] and still get lost. Brother Abraham says
[40:14] you can be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[40:16] every hour and still be lost because
[40:19] why? It's only the burning up. Yes. It
[40:23] says now when you burn something up and
[40:26] you cleanse it. Amen. Jesus even says
[40:29] that. He says when you do that, Amen.
[40:32] you make it all clean.
[40:35] He says if you leave it empty, seven
[40:37] more demons will come back. You can't
[40:40] leave it empty. So it has to be filled
[40:42] with the Holy Ghost, but not filled in
[40:45] the sense the way you look at it. Amen.
[40:47] It has to be sealed with the Holy Ghost.
[40:49] Amen. We'll we'll go through that just
[40:51] now as we go on to the end.
[40:55] All right. So it is going through the
[40:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the near
[41:00] future to the millennium to come in.
[41:03] That will complete the 7,000 years and
[41:06] finally the earth is annihilated again
[41:08] and the new city comes down from heaven
[41:11] where we will live eternally.
[41:14] That is bringing you into the eighth. If
[41:19] you see I wrote eighth there. Eighth is
[41:21] back to the first. Amen. Amen. So there
[41:25] is no more starting again.
[41:28] Eighth brings you back into the first
[41:31] and it means a circle is completed.
[41:33] Amen. Amen. Eternity, right? Amen. So
[41:38] never to go into any more days again.
[41:40] That's why the scripture is talking
[41:42] about days. But has completed the cycle
[41:45] and has moved into eternity.
[41:49] I believe right now those that are
[41:51] sealed with the Holy Ghost, the soul now
[41:54] I'm talking about. Amen. Is secure for
[41:57] eternity. Amen. Secure for eternity
[42:01] right now. See, immortality is reigning
[42:04] in you. See, so the believer has the
[42:07] same process as well as the church.
[42:10] Brother says what he does with the
[42:12] earth, he does with the church. And what
[42:15] he does with the church, he does with
[42:17] the individuals. So you must go through
[42:20] the same process. You must go through
[42:22] justification.
[42:23] You must go through sanctification.
[42:25] Amen. You must have a new heart. Then
[42:28] you must have a new spirit. And then his
[42:31] spirit comes. Amen. And dwells in you.
[42:34] So the process is a three-stage process
[42:38] for the final stage of God coming into
[42:41] you and sealing you. Amen. Three-stage
[42:43] process. Amen. Is that right? Amen. So
[42:48] the believer has the same process now.
[42:50] John 1:13. Now
[42:54] the believer is born with a
[42:57] representation in him. Yes. Can we have
[43:00] the one with the soul, brother? The
[43:05] diagram of the soul. Okay. Right. So
[43:08] every one of us we believe that brother
[43:10] Brandham eventually we understand this
[43:12] this diagrams although some of them
[43:14] don't really see it this way some put
[43:18] the the soul on this side and the spirit
[43:22] there um actually both ways are but
[43:24] right and yet it can be wrong right
[43:27] because we know if we look at the spirit
[43:30] the spirit of God is inside us. Amen. So
[43:33] in the soul the spirit is still there
[43:35] the holy ghost which is the spirit. So
[43:37] spirit, this is your spirit. Your body,
[43:40] your spirit, and your soul. But what's
[43:44] inside there is either darkness or
[43:46] light. Amen. So when every one of us are
[43:50] born,
[43:51] if you're a child of God, the day that
[43:54] you were born, there's a little seed
[43:56] inside the soul. Amen.
[43:59] There's a little seed inside the soul,
[44:01] which Brother Brandham calls the
[44:03] representation. Amen. It's your
[44:05] representation. That representation is
[44:09] the attribute of God. That is a thought
[44:11] of God. That's what God had you in him
[44:14] in his thoughts. Amen. And that
[44:16] attribute is in your soul. Yes. Amen.
[44:19] But it doesn't it's not alive. It
[44:22] remains as a seed in your soul. Amen.
[44:24] Until it strikes the light. Amen. When
[44:27] the light strikes it, it quickens it.
[44:30] And when it's quickened, it just doesn't
[44:32] become a tree. Yes. Amen. It goes
[44:34] through the process
[44:37] of justification, sanctification,
[44:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost, coming all
[44:42] the way right to it. The shock and still
[44:44] not the real seed yet until it comes
[44:47] right into the fruit of it. See, when it
[44:50] comes into the fruit now, it's
[44:52] manifesting the seed again. What life
[44:55] was put in the ground, amen, is a
[44:57] manifestation at the end. Amen. That's
[45:01] why I'm preaching to the church now. The
[45:03] anointed ones at the end times, the
[45:05] anointed ones at the end time is the
[45:08] only time you can see true
[45:11] manifestation.
[45:13] You throw a seed into the ground,
[45:16] you don't know what seed it is. It grows
[45:18] up. You see it as a stem. It could be
[45:20] like it could be a maze. It could be
[45:21] this. It could be that. You take chances
[45:23] guessing. Amen. But when it produces the
[45:26] fruit, then you can say, "Oh, I see what
[45:30] seed went into the ground." Yes. Is that
[45:32] right? You can see what it is. Is that
[45:34] right? So, let's go now quickly. John
[45:37] 1:13. And I want to talk about the
[45:38] representation. Yeah. John 1:13 says,
[45:41] "Which were born not of blood, nor of
[45:44] the will of the flesh, nor of the will
[45:46] of man, but of God." Yes. So, there's a
[45:49] lot of people that were not born in the
[45:51] will of God. Yes. Amen. They came to
[45:54] man's pleasure. Yes. But there's a lot
[45:56] of people that God purposed that they
[45:59] should be born.
[46:01] Amen. You were born for this age for a
[46:04] reason. God gave you certain potentials
[46:08] for you to see what you see today. Amen.
[46:11] You had to be born in this day. This
[46:14] message couldn't be born in Luther's
[46:16] day. It would have not worked. It
[46:19] couldn't be born in Wesley's day. It
[46:21] would have not worked. It had to be born
[46:23] in this day to meet your requirements
[46:27] because you were born in this season.
[46:29] See, there's a food that God gives in a
[46:31] certain season. And every season, amen,
[46:35] that God brings his food, amen, there's
[46:37] a people to receive it, right? There's
[46:40] nothing outside of that, right? So then
[46:43] when the light strikes him or her, that
[46:45] seed inside the soul, that is the gospel
[46:48] light, the seed is quickened and begins
[46:50] to grow. Yes. Let's go to Ephesians
[46:53] chapter 2 now. Ephesians chapter 2 and
[46:55] verse one.
[46:57] And you had he quickened. See when did
[47:00] he quicken you? Who were dead in
[47:03] trespasses and sins? You were in the
[47:06] world. Yes. You didn't know nothing
[47:08] about God. But you you didn't realize
[47:11] there was a seed in you. Amen. And that
[47:14] seed needed to be quickened. And when it
[47:17] hear the gospel trumpet blowing, it came
[47:20] to life. Yes. Right. And it was
[47:23] searching for something. wherein in time
[47:25] past he walked according to the go cause
[47:28] of this world. See you did walk in the
[47:30] world according to the prince of the
[47:32] power of the air. See that's Satan. The
[47:34] devil the spirit that now workketh in
[47:37] the children of disobedience
[47:40] among whom also we all had our
[47:43] conversation in time past in the lust of
[47:46] our flesh fulfilling the desires. Notice
[47:49] that word desire. Desire is conscious
[47:53] that Hebrews speaks about conscious is a
[47:56] desire. Amen. That is in your heart to
[48:00] lust for the flesh and the things of the
[48:01] world. Amen.
[48:04] And that's why Jesus Christ had to pay
[48:06] that price and he did it once and for
[48:08] all to take the desire away. Fulfilling
[48:11] the desires of the flesh and of the mind
[48:14] and were by nature the children of wroth
[48:17] even as others. Yes. But God who is rich
[48:22] in mercy for his great love whereworthy
[48:25] loved us even when we were in sins when
[48:29] we dead in sins had quickened us
[48:32] together with Christ by grace ye are
[48:36] saved. Not by your works.
[48:40] Amen. If you try by your works it'll
[48:42] fail. Amen. and had raised us up
[48:45] together and made us sit together in
[48:48] heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[48:52] Amen. So the process starts.
[48:56] You move from justification, Amen. to
[49:00] sanctification.
[49:01] You move from sanctification to the
[49:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And
[49:06] those that are overcome kisha. Yes.
[49:09] Amen. which is the shak moves into the
[49:13] promised land. Amen. Amen. Spiritually
[49:16] speaking, right there you are adopted
[49:19] and sealed with the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[49:23] Now the sealing is very very important.
[49:26] Because the sealing is to approve. Yes.
[49:31] Amen. Now you may say, "But when I
[49:34] accepted Jesus Christ into my life, I
[49:36] was saved and filled with the Holy
[49:38] Ghost." Yes, you did feel that. You felt
[49:41] like you were changed. You felt like
[49:44] something happened to you, darkness
[49:45] moved out of your heart, you felt good
[49:47] towards God. Amen. But if you had just
[49:50] stayed in that process, you will die.
[49:53] You will perish. You need to move on
[49:56] with God. Remember, God always moves
[49:59] forward. God in the with the children of
[50:02] Israel, they couldn't remain back. They
[50:04] had to move forward. If the pear of
[50:06] cloud moved, they moved. If the pearl of
[50:09] fire moved, they moved. If it stood
[50:11] still, they stood still. God is always
[50:13] on the move. And you got to move with
[50:16] the times. Amen. Just as the world is
[50:19] moving with the times. Everything is
[50:20] getting uh modern. Amen. So God's
[50:24] program has moved up too.
[50:27] So you got saved definitely. You could
[50:28] have had a justification sanification
[50:30] and not been baptized with his spirit.
[50:33] Or you could have went all the way until
[50:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not be
[50:37] sealed.
[50:38] All right, let's go to a message called
[50:40] the breach paragraph 69. The breach
[50:44] paragraph 69. You can follow here on the
[50:47] screen.
[50:51] Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God. Yes.
[50:55] Whereby ye are sealed. Can we all say it
[50:58] together?
[51:00] Sealed. Is that right? Sealed until
[51:03] when? Until the day of your redemption.
[51:06] The redemption of what? Body. The body.
[51:10] See, we got to wait for that time. So
[51:12] the until means to a certain time. See,
[51:16] hold that word redemption. The prophet
[51:18] says, see, until the day that the book
[51:20] of redemption has been revealed and the
[51:23] redeemer comes to claim his position.
[51:26] When did that happen? That happened in
[51:28] our day. Amen. Amen. The revelation of
[51:31] the seven seals. The opening of the
[51:35] book. Amen. must come in our day so that
[51:37] we can identify our names in the book.
[51:40] Amen. Amen. And see our position in
[51:43] Christ. And when that has happened,
[51:45] Amen. we are sealed then until the day
[51:49] of this body change. See that has
[51:52] already come.
[51:54] Until the day that the book of
[51:55] redemption has been revealed and the
[51:56] redeemer comes to claim his position,
[51:59] nothing can do it. See, don't grieve it.
[52:02] Amen. Stay. Do things that pleases God.
[52:06] Yes. Amen. Harden not your hearts. The
[52:10] Bible says in Hebrews
[52:13] today,
[52:15] not yesterday,
[52:17] not two years ago. While the message is
[52:20] being preached from the pulpit today,
[52:23] amen. Harden not your hearts because you
[52:26] can grieve the Holy Spirit. He leave
[52:28] you. Right.
[52:31] Don't grieve it. Stay. Do the things
[52:33] that please God for the book is recealed
[52:36] now and you are sealed. The Holy Spirit
[52:38] itself is the seal. Yes. Seal signifies
[52:43] now this is words I got from the
[52:45] dictionary. The prophet says seal
[52:47] signifies a finished work. Yes. And when
[52:51] the seventh seal is broken, the mystery
[52:54] of God that seal in these mysterious
[52:57] seals is finished. Amen. until the day
[53:01] that seal is broke and then it's
[53:04] revealed what's on the inside of it. So
[53:08] I was talking to one brother from
[53:09] another message church. Amen. So he says
[53:14] they believe that the seals are revealed
[53:17] but not open.
[53:19] So he says six seals have been open
[53:22] revealed and the seventh one we still
[53:24] waiting for it. So I said without the
[53:27] seven being open, how did you get to the
[53:29] six?
[53:33] Right? Is that right? How did you get to
[53:35] the six? Right? We try to use clever
[53:39] technologies and our intellectual to
[53:41] prove God's word and make it suit our
[53:44] ways. Amen. Six seals are revealed and
[53:48] the seventh is still waiting for. And
[53:51] six seals are revealed but not open.
[53:54] All right.
[53:56] So then now the scroll is there.
[54:00] Okay. There's a seal on on top of the
[54:03] scroll. There's a seal on top of the
[54:05] scroll. Right?
[54:08] How can I reveal what's inside the seal
[54:10] if I don't open the scroll first? If I
[54:12] don't break the seal. In other words,
[54:14] the seals must be opened first for me to
[54:18] read what's inside. Amen. To reveal
[54:20] what's on the inside. Is that right? So
[54:22] if I have a letter, Amen. I have a
[54:25] letter presented to me. I don't open the
[54:28] seal of that letter. How I'm going to
[54:30] know what's inside the contents? I don't
[54:33] know the contents. He said, "Right." So,
[54:35] I don't understand how it's revealed and
[54:37] not opened. The seal has to be broken
[54:40] first, opened, and then the letter is
[54:43] opened out and you can read what's
[54:44] inside. Now, it's revealed what's on the
[54:46] inside. Is that right? See, otherwise
[54:49] it's seal. It's still the sealed book.
[54:51] Is that right?
[54:52] seal signifies now this is words I got
[54:55] from the dictionary of the prophet seal
[54:56] signifies a finished work and when the
[54:59] seventh seal is broken the mystery of
[55:01] God that's sealed in these mysterious
[55:04] seals is finished so he's even saying it
[55:06] here the prophet yes when the seventh
[55:08] seal is broke then we can go to the six
[55:12] and five and four is that right that's
[55:14] the only time you it's revealed see
[55:17] until the day that that seal is broke
[55:20] and it and then it's revealed
[55:22] what's on the inside of it. See, you see
[55:28] there is um if I want to give a letter,
[55:31] okay, say I have a letter to brother
[55:34] Joshua. All right, I have a letter, it's
[55:37] addressed to brother Joshua and I seal
[55:40] the envelope, it's addressed to brother
[55:43] Joshua. So brother pastor Aen can't
[55:47] interfere with that letter. Yes. Is that
[55:49] right? Any other brother sees a letter
[55:51] on the floor, they pick it up, it says,
[55:53] "No, it's it's addressed to brother
[55:56] Joshua." So, they'll try to find him and
[55:58] give him the letter. He is only entitled
[56:02] to open the seal of that letter. Amen.
[56:04] Right? When he opens it, then he can
[56:07] reveal what's on the inside. So, Christ
[56:10] is the only one that's entitled to
[56:12] reveal the seals. So, Christ has to be
[56:15] here first. The seventh seal has to be
[56:17] broke first. He has to be here first to
[56:20] reveal the other seals because it's only
[56:22] the owner can reveal it not anybody
[56:24] else. It says nobody is worthy to open
[56:27] the book neither to look upon it. Amen.
[56:29] It is only Christ can do it. You see? So
[56:32] Christ had to be Yeah. First Amen. to do
[56:35] that. Amen.
[56:37] If the man is wondering what's in that
[56:38] box here, the prophet says if the man is
[56:40] wondering what's in that box car say
[56:43] there is supposed to be such and such,
[56:45] they supposed to be he is pursuing
[56:49] but when the seal is broken and the door
[56:52] is open, we see into it and then see
[56:55] exactly what's in there. You see it and
[56:58] that's that will only be done at the end
[57:00] time. Amen. That seal is not allowed to
[57:03] be open any other time. only at the end.
[57:07] Amen. The anointed ones at the end time
[57:10] see will be the ones that will recognize
[57:12] it. Another thing a seal signifies is
[57:16] ownership. Amen. Yes. Ownership. It's
[57:20] sealed only to brother Joshua. It's
[57:24] sealed only to his bride. Amen. Christ
[57:27] must come and break the seal and reveal
[57:30] what's the secret inside. Amen. So
[57:33] ownership. See, the seal has a mark on
[57:35] it. Shows ownership. When you are bought
[57:38] by the blood of Jesus Christ and sealed
[57:41] by the Holy Ghost, you no longer belong
[57:44] to the world or anything pertaining to
[57:46] the world. You are owned by God. Amen.
[57:49] Amen. You're a product of God. Is that
[57:51] right?
[57:53] Another thing is a seal is a security.
[57:57] Now, a lot of people don't believe in
[57:59] eternal security. Well, I do. Amen. I
[58:02] believe if I'm sealed now of the Holy
[58:03] Ghost, that's the only way I know I'm
[58:05] going there in the rapture. Other than
[58:07] that, I don't know. Amen. So, some of
[58:09] you must be uh doubting and saying, um,
[58:12] would I make it? Would I not? See, the
[58:15] bride of Christ doesn't doubt and
[58:17] doesn't say would I or would I not. You
[58:19] know for sure that you're going in.
[58:21] Amen. You're either in or you out. You
[58:23] right now got to be in. If you're not in
[58:26] right now, you're not going in. See,
[58:28] another thing is a seed is a security.
[58:30] Seal means you are secure.
[58:33] Now you that don't believe in eternal
[58:35] security. I don't know. See, but now but
[58:38] a seal signifies security to its
[58:40] destination.
[58:42] Wow. Until
[58:45] until that guy that would try to break
[58:48] that seal and the Holy Spirit seal
[58:50] cannot be broken. Yes.
[58:53] Now Jesus says in a parable in Matthew
[58:56] 13:19, he says, "When anyone yet the
[58:59] word of the kingdom and understandeth it
[59:03] not, then cometh the wicked one and
[59:06] catch it catch it away that which was
[59:09] sown in his heart."
[59:11] That is why it's so important when you
[59:13] come to church that you know what you
[59:15] believe. You know where you stand. You
[59:17] have a revelation of your pastor. You
[59:19] have revelation of your church. You know
[59:21] why you in this church? You know the
[59:23] reason why you're following God and
[59:25] what's going on in your life. Amen. You
[59:27] have to have a revelation.
[59:29] Amen. When you have a revelation in your
[59:31] heart, the devil cannot take that away.
[59:34] But if you doubt, he can take it away.
[59:36] See, right? This is he which receiveth
[59:40] seed by the wayside. And verse 22 says,
[59:44] "He also that receiveth seed among the
[59:47] thorns is he that ythed the word, and
[59:50] the care of this world, and the
[59:52] deceitfulness of riches choked the word,
[59:55] and he becometh unfruitful."
[59:59] Now
[1:00:00] remember Judas, he came as close to
[1:00:03] being baptized
[1:00:05] but didn't enter in because money was
[1:00:08] more important to him. Yes. Amen. He
[1:00:11] sold the word of God. Careful what we do
[1:00:14] with the word of God. What are you doing
[1:00:17] with Christ on hands? Amen. In this very
[1:00:20] close moment, a lot of people are
[1:00:22] chasing money because we need it. Things
[1:00:25] are getting harder. Life is getting
[1:00:27] harder and we need money to live and
[1:00:30] enjoy ourselves. Amen. There's more
[1:00:32] pleasures to enjoy in these days. So, we
[1:00:34] like luxury eating, luxury living,
[1:00:37] luxury dressing. Amen. So, money is a
[1:00:40] big thing. So people are chasing money.
[1:00:43] Amen. People are chasing popularity.
[1:00:46] Amen. And ministers also are chasing
[1:00:50] women. So we having a lot of problems in
[1:00:53] the realms of the message too. See? All
[1:00:57] right. Let's go. That is why the Bible
[1:00:59] says in Hebrews chapter 6:4, I want you
[1:01:02] to take note of this scripture. Very
[1:01:03] nice scripture. For it is impossible for
[1:01:07] those who were once enlightened
[1:01:12] and have tasted of the heavenly gift.
[1:01:15] See I put that in capsule letter. Tasted
[1:01:18] number one. Amen. Heavenly gift number
[1:01:20] two. Amen. Those are the important
[1:01:23] things that the good word of God and the
[1:01:26] powers of the world to come. Notice the
[1:01:28] words tasted there. Yes. And the
[1:01:31] heavenly gift. Amen.
[1:01:35] So my wife and I, we go to a restaurant.
[1:01:38] Amen. She orders whatever she likes to
[1:01:41] eat. I order whatever I like to eat.
[1:01:44] Amen. And bring it to us. And we really
[1:01:46] enjoying our meal. In between while I'm
[1:01:49] eating, I say, "You know what, babes?
[1:01:51] Don't you like to try some of my food?"
[1:01:54] And I think you'll do that, too. Let's
[1:01:56] just try just give it a taste. All
[1:01:58] right. She says, "Okay." She takes a
[1:02:01] Amen. a spoonful and she tries it and
[1:02:04] what happens? She says, "Oh, it's very
[1:02:07] nice, very delicious, but I'm happy with
[1:02:10] my meal." Is that right?
[1:02:14] I'm happy with my meal. You carry on
[1:02:15] with yours. I'll carry on with mine. Is
[1:02:17] that right? So, tasting is just to try
[1:02:20] it. Yes. Amen. That's what the scripture
[1:02:23] is saying. They tasted of it. You've
[1:02:25] given them the truth. They have tasted
[1:02:27] of it. They have tried it. They said
[1:02:29] it's very nice. It's the truth. But we
[1:02:32] happy with what we have. That's right.
[1:02:35] You you you you come across a lot of
[1:02:37] denominations like that. Amen. So they
[1:02:41] have been justified,
[1:02:43] sanctified, baptized with fire. But when
[1:02:46] you give them this new meal offering,
[1:02:48] they say, "Wow, it's nice, but I will
[1:02:51] remain with my meal." Amen. What is the
[1:02:55] heavenly gift? The Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:02:58] Amen. When you give the word to someone,
[1:03:00] you're giving them the heavenly gift.
[1:03:03] You're giving them you're giving them a
[1:03:05] taste. Expecting them to want more. Yes.
[1:03:10] See what my wife should have said. Oh,
[1:03:12] it's nice. Give me give me your meal.
[1:03:14] I'll take yours.
[1:03:17] See, we should have swapped. But she's
[1:03:19] happy with hers. Is that right? And
[1:03:21] that's what denominations and message
[1:03:23] people are. They happy with what they
[1:03:25] have. Yes. We happy in our church. We
[1:03:27] excited. The Holy Spirit is moving in
[1:03:29] the church. People are getting healed.
[1:03:31] Signs and wonders are taking place. But
[1:03:34] brother, do you know what's happening in
[1:03:35] this time? What you mean, brother? Do
[1:03:38] you know that the seals are open? That
[1:03:40] Christ came down in this time? No,
[1:03:42] brother, we don't need all that. We
[1:03:44] quite happy with what we have. Yes. Is
[1:03:46] that right? See, they tasted of the
[1:03:48] heavenly gift and they satisfied with
[1:03:51] what they have. See,
[1:03:54] so when you give the word to someone,
[1:03:56] you're giving them the heavenly gift.
[1:03:58] They are satisfied to remain in the
[1:04:01] Pentecostal age. Now, let me bring you
[1:04:04] further. They are satisfied to stay in
[1:04:08] the message ranks. Yes. So, we have had
[1:04:12] a message in our day. Yes. Amen. But
[1:04:16] beside that, we have had a shout in our
[1:04:19] day. Yes, we have had a message within a
[1:04:22] message. And the message within a
[1:04:25] message is the capital letter message
[1:04:27] that was associated with the shout in
[1:04:30] our day. And if you satisfied with just
[1:04:33] the message of brother Brham's message,
[1:04:36] what he brought brought as a prophet,
[1:04:38] amen, you will die and you will perish
[1:04:41] and not go in the rapture. You will go
[1:04:43] through the tribulation period because
[1:04:45] you know the sleeping virgins are part
[1:04:47] of the message.
[1:04:49] The sleeping virgins are part of the
[1:04:50] message because a virgin is a clean
[1:04:54] living person. They are message
[1:04:56] believers. They are not oes. They are
[1:04:58] not harlots. Harlots are denominations.
[1:05:02] But a message believer is one of those
[1:05:04] virgins. But she wasn't wise enough to
[1:05:08] recognize the oil. And the oil is the
[1:05:10] Holy Ghost coming. She did not recognize
[1:05:13] Christ coming in this day. She missed
[1:05:15] that coming. So she didn't have enough
[1:05:17] oil. Yes. You see, so she's closed out.
[1:05:20] Amen. But those that recognize that
[1:05:23] coming and see that oil, Amen. they go
[1:05:27] in and the door is closed. Right. So
[1:05:31] they are satisfied to remain in the
[1:05:33] first and second pool, but they don't
[1:05:35] want to move into the third pool. Yeah.
[1:05:38] And as soon as you refuse the sealing of
[1:05:41] the Holy Ghost, verse 6 says now in
[1:05:43] Hebrews chapter 6, if they shall fall
[1:05:47] away to renew them again unto
[1:05:50] repentance, it's quite impossible. So in
[1:05:53] other words, God don't do the process
[1:05:55] again. If he took you through the
[1:05:57] process of justification,
[1:05:59] sanctification, and the baptism of the
[1:06:01] Holy Ghost, and you didn't get sealed
[1:06:03] with the Holy Ghost, and you fall away,
[1:06:05] when you fall, God doesn't renew that
[1:06:08] process again of justification,
[1:06:09] sanctification. You fall out completely.
[1:06:12] So that's why it is hard for you to
[1:06:14] repent, the Bible say. And I've seen
[1:06:16] many people that walked away from the
[1:06:18] message. Amen. I don't say that they
[1:06:19] can't come back, but lots of them when
[1:06:22] they walked away, it's so hard to get
[1:06:23] them back. Yes. Very, very hard. Amen.
[1:06:26] Because they have walked away from the
[1:06:29] true word of God. See, if they shall
[1:06:32] fall away to renew them again, Paul
[1:06:35] speaks about him. Brother Brham speaks
[1:06:36] about this. Amen. Unto repentance, it's
[1:06:39] quite impossible.
[1:06:41] Seeing why, why is this impossible?
[1:06:43] Seeing they crucified to themselves the
[1:06:46] son of God aresh and put him to an open
[1:06:50] shame,
[1:06:52] redemption by judgment. See, look at
[1:06:55] Peter. He was a seed of God.
[1:06:59] He had the representation in him. Yes.
[1:07:02] Is that right?
[1:07:05] Can you put this the picture with the
[1:07:07] two church ages now?
[1:07:13] When Jesus came, Amen. The Jews rejected
[1:07:16] him. They crucified him. Is that right?
[1:07:18] Yes. On Calvary, they crucified him
[1:07:20] because why? Brother Arab said they
[1:07:22] rejected the word. Yes. When you reject
[1:07:24] Christ, you reject the word. They
[1:07:27] rejected the word and that made a way
[1:07:29] for Pentecost to come, which was the 120
[1:07:31] people that went into the upper room,
[1:07:33] received the Holy Ghost in the upper
[1:07:35] room. And that was a Jewish Pentecost.
[1:07:38] Amen. A Jewish Pentecost that made a way
[1:07:42] for the Gentiles to come in.
[1:07:45] That they were waved over the Gentile
[1:07:47] age. They were the first fruit. Amen.
[1:07:50] that was waved over the gentile age to
[1:07:52] produce a gentile church. And when the
[1:07:55] gentile church started, Amen. all the
[1:07:58] way through, there was rejection. There
[1:08:02] was accepting and there was rejection.
[1:08:04] See, so the acceptance came when they
[1:08:06] accepted the word, they were called in
[1:08:09] and they were called in with their
[1:08:10] messengers. But those that rejected,
[1:08:12] amen, fall under a temporary judgment.
[1:08:16] The prophet says they fall under a
[1:08:18] temporary judgment. And that's why after
[1:08:20] every church age there was a plague a
[1:08:23] major plague that struck the earth.
[1:08:25] Amen. And after the messenger left and
[1:08:27] the people rejected that plague fell on
[1:08:29] the earth. Co is one of them.
[1:08:33] Amen. It shows how close we are because
[1:08:35] he rejected the message in this day. Co
[1:08:37] is one of the plagues. And you see at
[1:08:39] the end of the seventh church age there
[1:08:41] was another rejection.
[1:08:43] Amen. And the rejection came by
[1:08:46] denominations
[1:08:48] rejecting the word of God. When they
[1:08:50] rejected the word of God, they put the
[1:08:53] word onto Calvary. That's why it says
[1:08:56] here it's a second crucifixion of Jesus
[1:08:58] Christ. I indict this generation for the
[1:09:02] second crucifixion of Jesus Christ
[1:09:04] because they rejected the word. Amen. So
[1:09:07] when they rejected the word now, Amen.
[1:09:09] It brought a bride out. Yes. And we are
[1:09:13] now that Pentecostal group. Amen. That's
[1:09:16] speaking in tongues by the word of God.
[1:09:20] A new language. We're speaking. When the
[1:09:22] seals opened, the Bible became a new
[1:09:24] book. Amen. So the language has changed.
[1:09:27] Pentecostal group now in the Gentiles.
[1:09:30] See to make a way for the Jews to come.
[1:09:33] The 144. Amen. See, so there had to be
[1:09:35] two Calvaries. One Calvary with Jesus.
[1:09:38] Amen. for redemption, another Calvary
[1:09:41] for claiming.
[1:09:43] See, the seals had to be broken to bring
[1:09:45] a claim. And there was another Calvary
[1:09:47] again for claiming and making another
[1:09:49] Pentecost for the Gentiles. Yeah, it was
[1:09:51] the Pentecost for the Jews. There it was
[1:09:53] the Pentecost for the Gentiles, making a
[1:09:55] way for the 144,000 to come in. Amen. So
[1:09:58] the crucifying of the word as not only
[1:10:05] people say plead the blood, plead the
[1:10:08] blood. Okay, there's nothing wrong with
[1:10:10] that. But the blood, brother Bam says,
[1:10:12] fell on the ground. Yes. And it dried
[1:10:15] up. God, Jesus's blood fell on the
[1:10:18] ground and dried up. It was the life in
[1:10:21] the blood that was important. That life
[1:10:23] didn't dry up. That was the cell of God.
[1:10:25] Yes. Those cells now came into your life
[1:10:29] to seal you, to approve you. Amen. That
[1:10:33] you are part of God. You had you were
[1:10:36] born in the beginning when you were born
[1:10:38] with that representation. That was the
[1:10:40] Holy Spirit in you, not as the Holy
[1:10:42] Ghost. It was the Holy Spirit as a a
[1:10:46] seed. It got jeatized and quickened and
[1:10:50] started to grow and did went through
[1:10:52] justification, went through
[1:10:53] sanctification, went through the baptism
[1:10:55] of the Holy Ghost, and then the Holy
[1:10:57] Ghost himself now comes and seals that
[1:11:01] to approve it. Amen. Now you are sealed
[1:11:05] with the Holy Ghost. See, now you are a
[1:11:07] son and daughter of God. And there's no
[1:11:10] ways for you to turn back and go in the
[1:11:11] world. There is when you seal with the
[1:11:13] Holy Ghost, I'm telling you and giving
[1:11:15] you a guarantee you can never backslide.
[1:11:18] Never backslide because how can the Holy
[1:11:20] Ghost backslide? He it's sealed in your
[1:11:22] soul. It's finished work. Amen. When God
[1:11:25] finishes something, it is done. Amen. He
[1:11:28] doesn't go back on his word. That's why
[1:11:30] when God created the heavens and the
[1:11:31] earth in the beginning, he rested back
[1:11:33] on the seven days. He said, "I'm happy
[1:11:35] with my work." And he never went back to
[1:11:36] his work again. Is it right? So, it's
[1:11:40] important to follow this now.
[1:11:42] So the future it says now in page 34. We
[1:11:46] can just go to the quotation future page
[1:11:48] 34.
[1:11:53] There's your holy convocation. Not have
[1:11:56] anything to do with the literal thing.
[1:11:58] It's beyond that. It's into the kingdom
[1:12:00] of God with eternal life with the
[1:12:03] predestinated that never did start. If
[1:12:06] you want, if you claim to have eternal
[1:12:09] life, eternal life had to be in you.
[1:12:13] Because eternal doesn't start
[1:12:15] if you know the meaning of eternal. It
[1:12:18] never starts and it never ends. So it
[1:12:20] means if you claim to have eternal life,
[1:12:22] you had to have a part of God in you
[1:12:25] when you were born. See? Amen. So he
[1:12:30] says, "Now
[1:12:32] um you wasn't saved on any day." See, it
[1:12:35] never started on any day. You wasn't
[1:12:37] saved on any day. You was always saved.
[1:12:41] Jesus just come to redeem that. But you
[1:12:44] were saved be from the beginning because
[1:12:46] you had eternal life to begin with.
[1:12:49] Hallelujah. You were saved from the
[1:12:51] beginning because you had eternal life
[1:12:52] to begin with. See, is that right? When
[1:12:56] Jesus asked Peter, "Who do you say I
[1:12:58] am?" Peter said, "Thou art the Christ,
[1:13:00] the son of the living God." Jesus said,
[1:13:03] "Blessed art thou, Simon Jonah, for
[1:13:06] flesh and blood had not revealed it unto
[1:13:08] thee, but my father which is in heaven."
[1:13:11] See, the seed germ of life which came
[1:13:15] from the father was in Peter.
[1:13:18] Amen.
[1:13:20] See, he was a seed. He recognized who
[1:13:23] Jesus was. But he was not sealed yet.
[1:13:27] He was not sealed yet. Why? Before Jesus
[1:13:31] crucification, he denies the law three
[1:13:33] times. Yes.
[1:13:36] Peter might have had justification. He
[1:13:38] might have had sanctification. Amen. But
[1:13:41] he was not filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:13:43] here. See, he was not filled with the
[1:13:46] Holy Ghost. He was not ready for
[1:13:48] preaching the gospel because Jesus told
[1:13:50] him three times, "Feed my sheep. Feed my
[1:13:54] sheep. Amen. But unless you convert it,
[1:13:58] see, then go and feed my sheep. See Luke
[1:14:01] 22:31.
[1:14:02] Luke 22:31. And the Lord said, Simon,
[1:14:05] Simon, behold, Satan had desired to have
[1:14:08] you, that he may sift you as wheat, but
[1:14:12] I have prayed for thee, that thy faith
[1:14:14] failed not. Notice, and when thou art
[1:14:18] what? Converted,
[1:14:21] strengthen thy brethren.
[1:14:24] So Peter had the seed gem of life in him
[1:14:26] but he was not sealed yet. He had the
[1:14:29] baptism Holy Ghost but he was not sealed
[1:14:31] yet. See what happened? Peter had known
[1:14:35] Jesus for a long time now. He knew him
[1:14:37] in the flesh, walked with him, cast out
[1:14:39] devils, prayed for the sick, and the
[1:14:41] sick recovered and many great signs and
[1:14:43] wonders he was doing. But he didn't
[1:14:45] recognize a conversion yet. He did not
[1:14:48] receive that. Amen.
[1:14:52] Look at the way he denied the Lord.
[1:14:54] Cussing and fussing and getting angry,
[1:14:56] refusing that he knows the Lord.
[1:14:59] Couple of days before that, he's
[1:15:01] recognizing be Christ, the son of the
[1:15:04] living God. Amen. Now, when Christ is
[1:15:07] getting crucified, he's denying the
[1:15:09] Lord. What kind of a believer is that?
[1:15:12] See, is that right? See, he didn't have
[1:15:14] a conversion yet. Right.
[1:15:18] Acts chapter 2 now and verse one.
[1:15:22] Sorry, I just like a lot of scriptures
[1:15:24] and quotations if you don't mind. Acts
[1:15:27] chapter 2 and verse one.
[1:15:29] After his conversion, now and when the
[1:15:32] day of Pentecost was fully come, they
[1:15:34] were all with one accord in one place.
[1:15:37] And suddenly there came a sound from
[1:15:39] heaven as of a rushing mighty wind. And
[1:15:42] it filled the whole house where they
[1:15:45] were sitting. And they appeared unto
[1:15:47] them cloven tongues like as of a fire
[1:15:49] and it set upon each of them and they
[1:15:52] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:15:54] began to speak with other tongues as the
[1:15:58] spirit gave them utterance.
[1:16:00] All right. So because of time now I'm
[1:16:02] just going to go quickly to verse 13. It
[1:16:05] says others mocking said these men are
[1:16:07] full of new wine. Oh indeed they were.
[1:16:10] When you receive the word by revelation
[1:16:12] it's new wine. Amen. to the soul. And
[1:16:15] the people behaved like they drunk.
[1:16:17] Verse 14. But Peter standing up with the
[1:16:21] 11 lifted up his voice and said unto
[1:16:23] them, "Hey men of Judah, and all ye that
[1:16:26] dwell in Jerusalem, be this known unto
[1:16:29] you and an unto my words." Now Peter is
[1:16:32] not that shy guy. And he's denying the
[1:16:35] Lord anymore. Now he's standing up and
[1:16:37] he's proclaiming something to the
[1:16:39] people. Amen. It says, "For these are
[1:16:41] not drunk, as he supposed, seeing it is,
[1:16:44] but the third hour of the day, but this
[1:16:46] is that which was spoken by the prophet
[1:16:50] Joel." Amen. Amen. Amen. See, and it
[1:16:54] shall come to pass in the last days,
[1:16:57] sayeth God. I will pour out my spirit
[1:16:59] upon all flesh. And your sons and your
[1:17:02] daughters shall prophesy, and your young
[1:17:05] men shall see visions, and your old men
[1:17:08] shall see shall dream dreams.
[1:17:13] This is exactly what's happening.
[1:17:17] Pentecost has come. Yes. Amen. They
[1:17:20] seeing visions. They're seeing dreams.
[1:17:23] And the Holy Spirit is moving amongst
[1:17:24] the people. They begin to speak in a new
[1:17:26] tongue. Amen. Fulfilling prophecy of
[1:17:30] Joel 2.
[1:17:35] If that Pentecost,
[1:17:38] Amen, produced that,
[1:17:42] what about the Pentecost of today?
[1:17:45] Would it not produce that again?
[1:17:47] There was a first fruit Pentecost of
[1:17:51] people prophesying in dreams and visions
[1:17:54] in this day. Amen. Amen. There was and
[1:17:58] it happened exactly like how it happened
[1:18:00] then. They were filled with the Holy
[1:18:02] Ghost. And brother Bam says, "We are so
[1:18:03] blessed to have these spiritual people
[1:18:05] in our church." Amen. Is that right?
[1:18:10] So what Peter is doing, he's not ashamed
[1:18:12] of the gospel. He is now facing the
[1:18:14] people and preaching the gospel. Verse
[1:18:16] 32, this Jesus had God raised up whereof
[1:18:21] we all are witnesses. Amen.
[1:18:24] Jes Peter is no more saying now I deny
[1:18:27] the Lord. He says, "No, no, no, no, no.
[1:18:29] I'm a witness now that the Lord is risen
[1:18:32] and that I'm converted. I'm a solid
[1:18:35] believer. I want to tell you that that
[1:18:37] same Jesus that was crucified is living
[1:18:40] in me. I am now a written apostle read
[1:18:43] of all men to proclaim the gospel of
[1:18:45] Jesus Christ to every one of you." Amen.
[1:18:48] And tell you, come to this quickly,
[1:18:50] otherwise you're going to perish. Amen.
[1:18:53] See Jesus is a witness
[1:18:55] now of Jesus Christ. Sorry, he is now a
[1:18:58] witness of Jesus Christ and not denying
[1:19:00] him. And verse 36 said, "Therefore let
[1:19:03] all the house of Israel know assuredly
[1:19:05] that God had made the same Jesus whom ye
[1:19:09] have crucified, both Lord and Christ."
[1:19:11] Amen. Amen. He's not the second person
[1:19:15] in the Godhead. Amen. He's both Lord and
[1:19:18] Christ.
[1:19:19] See
[1:19:25] he was speaking boldly about Jesus
[1:19:27] Christ
[1:19:28] now saying that God had made that same
[1:19:31] Jesus both Lord and Christ. This is when
[1:19:35] Peter introduced the baptism in the name
[1:19:37] of Jesus Christ. So believers can giving
[1:19:40] can give up smoking, can give up
[1:19:43] drinking, gambling, all the things of
[1:19:45] the world and yet fall away during the
[1:19:47] journey of the gospel. Yes.
[1:19:52] I just want to say this. If you are
[1:19:54] justified, you can have doubt in your
[1:19:57] heart. If you are sanctified, you can
[1:20:00] have doubt in your heart. If you are
[1:20:02] baptized with the Holy Ghost, you can
[1:20:03] have doubt in your heart. What is doubt?
[1:20:06] Sin.
[1:20:08] So let's take that to the earth.
[1:20:11] In Noah's time when Noah's flood came.
[1:20:13] Amen. After Noah left, was there still
[1:20:16] sin on the earth? Yes. Sin still
[1:20:19] continued after the justification. When
[1:20:21] Jesus came, he poured his blood on the
[1:20:23] earth. Was still sin still on the earth?
[1:20:26] Sin was still on the earth. Sin is still
[1:20:27] on the earth now. Even after we're going
[1:20:30] to come for the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:31] Ghost, sin is still going to be on the
[1:20:32] earth. And even when we go in the
[1:20:34] millennium, sin is still going to be
[1:20:36] around
[1:20:38] because Satan is only going to be bound
[1:20:40] for a thousand years. He's going to be
[1:20:42] released after the thousand years. Sin
[1:20:44] is still going to be around. So when
[1:20:46] does sin stop? Sin stops when the new
[1:20:51] city comes down. When everything is
[1:20:54] annihilated and burnt up and dissolved,
[1:20:58] then sin stops. Satan is completely
[1:21:00] annihilated and sickness is completely
[1:21:03] annihilated. Everything is gone. The
[1:21:05] Holy Ghost, the headstone comes onto the
[1:21:10] pyramid and seals it
[1:21:13] as Christ being the light of the new
[1:21:16] city. Amen. So if that happens to the
[1:21:19] earth, think about your life. It has to
[1:21:23] go through the same process. Otherwise,
[1:21:26] sin is still going to be in your heart.
[1:21:28] Without the sealing, you will still have
[1:21:30] sin in your heart. See, so the soul
[1:21:33] needs to be sealed. When the soul is
[1:21:35] sealed, there's no more sin. Amen. It's
[1:21:38] completely annihilated,
[1:21:41] right?
[1:21:42] Your name is cleared from now on to the
[1:21:45] way back to the mind of God. Your abs
[1:21:47] deed is cleared. Never sin in the first
[1:21:49] place. Yes. Brother Rab said, "We fell
[1:21:52] into it." All right. If I get the time
[1:21:54] to read that quote that now entitles you
[1:21:57] to the new body, entitles you for a
[1:22:00] resurrection. Anything less will mean no
[1:22:03] rapture. Yes. See the future home
[1:22:06] paragraph uh page 16.
[1:22:10] Now when you asked or you are forgiven
[1:22:12] of your sins, you have only done this,
[1:22:15] taken that away. But the thing that made
[1:22:18] you do it, it's still there. That's that
[1:22:21] old root of evil. It's still there.
[1:22:23] Notice then you repent and you are
[1:22:26] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:22:28] that he forgave you of your sin. Notice
[1:22:31] then secondly comes sanctification
[1:22:34] which sets your mind in order for
[1:22:37] holiness to think right taking away. Uh
[1:22:41] sanctification is a compound Greek word
[1:22:44] which means clean and set aside for
[1:22:46] service. Then the next comes the baptism
[1:22:49] of the fire. Amen. and the Holy Ghost
[1:22:52] that God might dwell in us. And the fire
[1:22:56] of God cleanses our heart from sin and
[1:22:59] puts the Holy Ghost inside. Then we
[1:23:01] bring forth the same life that this did
[1:23:05] because that's in us. Amen. Notice in
[1:23:08] the natural birth when a woman gives
[1:23:10] birth to a baby, the natural life types
[1:23:13] are spiritual. When a woman gives birth
[1:23:15] to a baby in the natural, the first
[1:23:18] thing happened is breaking of water,
[1:23:20] then blood and then the spirit which is
[1:23:23] life.
[1:23:24] Grab the little fellow and spank him and
[1:23:27] away he goes screaming. See water,
[1:23:30] blood, spirit. And now when a baby is
[1:23:33] born into the kingdom of God, it comes
[1:23:35] the same way. Water, blood, spirit. Can
[1:23:39] you see the church that's the the three
[1:23:42] stages makes a way for the very person
[1:23:46] of Christ to seal you?
[1:23:50] So everybody used to say we must be
[1:23:52] justified. We must be sanctified. We
[1:23:54] must be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:23:56] finished. Yes. No. See it you must be
[1:24:02] sealed with the Holy Ghost. The person
[1:24:05] of Christ must be in you. Amen. Um, one
[1:24:08] more quote. The future home on page 17.
[1:24:11] I don't think I'll be able to finish my
[1:24:12] sermon today. Brother Pastor Hen,
[1:24:20] how's this church? You like long
[1:24:21] preaching or you get tired of preachers
[1:24:23] that preach long,
[1:24:27] right? Page uh they always say in other,
[1:24:31] you know, they so after church somebody
[1:24:32] will come and tell me, you know,
[1:24:33] brother, the mind can only take so much.
[1:24:38] But you see, I'm not actually talking to
[1:24:39] your mind. I'm talking to your heart.
[1:24:43] Amen. But anyhow, the mind receives the
[1:24:45] word and it drops it into the heart.
[1:24:47] Amen. So, quotation um the future on
[1:24:52] page 17. A man can repent of sin and
[1:24:55] he's still thinking of it. Well, maybe
[1:24:57] he's immoral man. Every immorall looking
[1:25:00] woman he finds, it's still there. Maybe
[1:25:03] he's a drunkard. Every time he smells a
[1:25:05] drink, it's still there. See? But then
[1:25:08] when he gets sanctified, that cleanses
[1:25:11] that desire
[1:25:13] out of him. See, it takes the want of it
[1:25:17] away. He can be still be tempted, but he
[1:25:21] takes the want away. Still, he's not
[1:25:23] right yet. Then he is baptized with the
[1:25:25] Holy Ghost, the fire cleansed, burnt
[1:25:27] out, cleaned up, and then put into the
[1:25:30] service of God. Sanctification only sets
[1:25:33] aside for service. What is I like to
[1:25:37] close with this now. What is the
[1:25:39] evidence of the Holy Ghost?
[1:25:42] The evidence in the message days
[1:25:46] was okay to say I'm baptized with the
[1:25:48] Holy Ghost. Amen. So, let me distinguish
[1:25:52] between message groups and bride. How
[1:25:56] many believe that we are the bride of
[1:25:58] Christ? We're not a message group or
[1:26:00] we're not message people because we are
[1:26:04] called out of a church. Amen. A bride is
[1:26:08] called out. See, so the evidence in the
[1:26:11] message days it was okay to see say I'm
[1:26:13] baptized with the Holy Ghost. But the
[1:26:16] evidence for today is more than that.
[1:26:19] Amen. When you can receive the
[1:26:22] revelation of the word for today,
[1:26:25] receive the revelation of the season,
[1:26:28] when you can understand that, then it's
[1:26:31] the new birth. Amen. I'll just close
[1:26:34] with the last quote on that. Right. Uh
[1:26:37] par future on page 30.
[1:26:40] That's what we was talking the other
[1:26:42] day. The evidence of the Holy Ghost. See
[1:26:44] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when
[1:26:46] you can receive the word not some system
[1:26:50] but have a clear understanding.
[1:26:53] How do you know the words clear
[1:26:55] understanding? Watch it vindicate
[1:26:57] itself. Well, you say I see this do that
[1:27:00] do it that and oh yes weeds live the
[1:27:03] same way but it's got to be the entire
[1:27:06] word to be the bride. You have to be
[1:27:10] part of him. He is the word. See, and
[1:27:12] what if he part of him? Sorry. And what
[1:27:15] if part of him is it? The word that's
[1:27:17] promised for this day when he calls his
[1:27:20] bride. Amen. You are part of that. You
[1:27:23] get it now. Don't lose that now. Notice.
[1:27:26] And he makes it a foot place to live
[1:27:29] through eternity. Amen. Amen. So God has
[1:27:33] brought his church. We have come all the
[1:27:35] way. We are finished with Luther. Amen.
[1:27:39] Was justification. We finished with
[1:27:41] Wesley sanctification. We finished with
[1:27:44] the Pentecostal age. Amen. The baptism
[1:27:47] of the Holy Ghost. Now it's the
[1:27:49] headstone himself
[1:27:51] coming and sealing the church. See, then
[1:27:56] only the church can go in the rapture.
[1:27:59] Amen. The headstone has to seal it and
[1:28:02] approve. Amen. The seal is an approval
[1:28:06] that God has approved his word. He's
[1:28:08] approved it in you. Amen. That's why he
[1:28:11] seals you. May the Lord bless you this
[1:28:13] morning as we stand together. Amen.
[1:28:17] Praise God.
