TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. You may be seated. The Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know we felt the pull. We felt the tug in our souls, in our hearts to respond to the word of the Lord for the day &gt;&gt; and this time and season. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, is everyone good in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to be back in the house of the Lord to worship him &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; give him praise. Amen. You know the Bible says in the book of second Peter chapter 3, just want to read this. It says the second epistle, beloved, and I write unto you in both which I stir up your pure minds by the way of remembrance &gt;&gt; that you be mindful of the words which are spoken before by the holy prophets. &gt;&gt; I want you to include William Brandham there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm saying that for a reason &gt;&gt; in this church we are under the prophetic ministry &gt;&gt; of William Brandom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. because we under our messenger become the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And of and of the commandment of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior, knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, &gt;&gt; walking after their own lust." &gt;&gt; Amen. People not designed and called to be in ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they're lusting after things and they're there. So if there were scoffers of the first coming, there would be scoffers of the second coming. &gt;&gt; There must be scoffers of the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And saying where is the promise of his coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are finding the same pattern again. When history has already fulfilled, scriptures have already passed by. People that were never even born then are now disputing things that happened and now son of man ministry is revealed through the prophet. &gt;&gt; They never got to witness the sign with the back turn to the audience &gt;&gt; discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was that? If you're looking at a man, you missed the picture. &gt;&gt; You had to see Christ veil behind the man &gt;&gt; because no man can do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; So people are denominating around the wrong messenger. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. When brother Brandham says I must decrease, he must increase. Christ himself is the messenger that has come to his bride to his people to connect with them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So these sculptors are saying where is the promise of his coming? Now in this season I want to bring you up to date. The promise of his coming is the shout. &gt;&gt; The shout is for the living saints. &gt;&gt; You miss the shout, you miss the rapture. &gt;&gt; The voice is for the sleeping saints. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "Since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of create creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God, the heavens were whole." And the earth standing out of the water and in the water. Amen. I want to get to verse 9. And I want you to take comfort in his words that the Lord is not slack &gt;&gt; concerning his promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know how close we are to him coming to change our bodies and take us away? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; More time has passed &gt;&gt; behind us the history and we are this close. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To that body change. So hold on. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us would not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord, which shall come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth also, and the works that are there in shall be burned up. So what you are seeing now when people are are leaving the message and people are speaking against this. Remember what the Lord says, I'll send the angels first &gt;&gt; and I'll take the tears away first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody cla can claim they left the message. What happened was an angel came and plucked the tail. &gt;&gt; So when they post up post there on YouTube why I left the message, they must change those titles. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The angel pluck me up because I'm a tear. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; That's what they should be saying. &gt;&gt; Now scripture can't be broken. The Lord says, "Let them both grow together at harvest time. I'll send my angels and I'll pluck the tears out first." &gt;&gt; So don't be discouraged. You'll hear more and more people leaving and more and more people criticizing and more and more they did it with Jesus. Even through today, they dispute whether Jesus actually came. They dispute whether he rose again. &gt;&gt; So spirits don't die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I I want to encourage you to remain fervent in the faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be slack. Don't be missing church. &gt;&gt; Not in this time and season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're all the way up in the headstone now welcoming the the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember we have to be those connecting stones. Brother Brandham says we are like that flange coming to that needle point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uniting with the groom. &gt;&gt; So we are so excited. Amen. That we have recognized the word for our day and the message for our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this morning we want to welcome you and we've got sister Lwanda visiting with us this morning. Amen. Let's welcome our sister Lwanda. [applause] Amen. So bless you sister. Did you come up with a show? Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. God bless you. Welcome. Amen. Then we're happy to see our friend and our brother. Amen. Brothers Sopiso Makuan. Amen. So we met him four years ago. Amen. When he took those Easter meetings there nearbank and uh Amen. The Lord has blessed him tremendously in the ministry and he's here with his family. Amen. Sister I'm going to try and say it. I can't make the the [laughter] sister Seo. Brother Shamba. Amen. Brother Monash and Sister Shante. Let's give them a hand and welcome the family. [applause] It's amazing what four years can do. I know these kids being like very young four years ago, but uh food can really change you, right? Can make you grow. Amen. But we are to grow in the Lord as well. So, welcome family. And we glad that you can pass by our way to share the word of the Lord. Amen. And the Lord I know I've seen the brother you know going around and ministering and the Lord is really blessing his ministry. So he was passing by this way and we are glad that he contacted us to tell us he'll be coming through. How many of you under expectation this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you're under expectation the Lord will meet that expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you know if you leave the service here and you say I receive nothing your expectation was zero. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So right now while we sing the song I want you to increase your expectation. increase what you are coming here for, what you're believing the Lord for, and the Holy Spirit will begin to minister to your need. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to just come out of church tradition. We have come here to draw closer to the Lord. We have come here now to connect in a deeper relationship with the Lord. &gt;&gt; And how is he whispering love secrets to his bride? Through the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; So, we want to recognize the God behind our dear brother &gt;&gt; veiled in human flesh. &gt;&gt; And when we can approach it like that, you'll watch the service will take a different turn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together even as we receive our dear brother. Amen. Be at liberty to share the word of the Lord. Amen. [music] And you just pull on the word of God. Amen. Hallelujah. You just be hungry and thirsting after him. Amen. Let's sing. As as the deer panteth after the waters, my soul path after thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Brother Brandon preaches a message called thirst. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What thirst is in your soul this morning? Amen. [music] has the [singing] deer planted for the [singing] waters. So [music] my soul you see you alone. [music and singing] You are my heart. &gt;&gt; My heart's desire [music] to worship.

[singing] Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Greetings this morning in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A special special privilege to be together this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Really appreciate the Lord who has kept us. The Lord has been good to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we really just are grateful for the opportunity to be together with saints of like precious [music] faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Indeed. It was some four years ago [singing] out in Mang and and now has kept us. Last year we did come visiting the pastor was preaching somewhere. Yes. And [music] and I I got wrapped in the knuckles for sneaking in. And so I thought, okay, I'll repent this time and and let the pastor know that we we are around and so so glad to be together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we just um bring greetings and blessings. We ask that the Lord will just continue to bless you, bless you, man of God, and your family and the ministry down this way and holding on to this great revelation that we have received. &gt;&gt; Nothing greater than it, &gt;&gt; this closing minutes and seconds. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of all of human history. So so glad to be partakers of of that great happening that's happening in the day and age that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Let's open our Bibles. We'll read a few scriptures, but let's just start in the book of Genesis 5 verse 22 to 24. I was quite blessed when I had the pastor just touching on something that we want to speak about this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. And and it really is that time. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and our thought this morning is preparing the bride for the rapture. &gt;&gt; We are in that time. &gt;&gt; It's absolutely that. That's all that God is interested in. &gt;&gt; There's nothing else that he's interested in but to prepare us &gt;&gt; for the changing of amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why we just want to read about Enoch a little bit and then we will read other scriptures. But let's just read a familiar scripture. Genesis 5 22- 24. And Enoch walked with God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; After he begat Methuselah 300 years [clears throat] and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of Enoch were 300 605 years. And Enoch walked with God and he was snot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For God took care. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Most gracious and dear loving heavenly father. Thank you. &gt;&gt; We are so grateful blessed Lord this morning that we can be called your children. &gt;&gt; We can be identified with you father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's because we were in you before the foundation of the heavens. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because we are a manifestation of those attributes that &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; And we are so thankful that that it's only those that were in you that can recognize this. And that's why, Father, it's not what we can do and count it such a blessing to recognize who we are. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; By the revelation of the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, you've opened the scripture and we'll be reading the word and reading quotations and just sharing thoughts from this message of Malachi 4. We pray, Father, that the same anointing by which you wrote this Bible and anointed your prophet to reveal this Bible May it be the same anointing this morning. &gt;&gt; Speak to us, blessed father, for you alone are worthy to address. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; May you set aside this vessel, Lord, and just use it for your honor and glory. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We pray, Father, for the local pastor, Lord, with great responsibility over the souls, Lord, [crying] &gt;&gt; blessing, blessed father. Bless his ministry, blessed father, bless his families. I pray as well. Commit his family also to you, oh God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every brother, sister here, you know the needs of your children and you alone can minister to the most needless man. &gt;&gt; Is our prayer father that we do that oh God as we ask father and commit the service commit ourselves to you in that precious blessed name of the Lord Jesus Christ the king. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. You may be dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before we get into our thought this morning, we just want to read a little quotation and I was just glad again when you know the pastor reminded us and emphasized again that we are under the ministry &gt;&gt; of the seventh angel messenger. &gt;&gt; That's who we are under this morning and that's that's what we believe. Yes. &gt;&gt; And nothing else, nothing new. Not some fantastic new revelation. &gt;&gt; It's the message that God sent us packaged in with a prophet called Millham. Yes. &gt;&gt; But it was God speaking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what we believe and that's what we have received. and and in in question and answers on Hebrews number 3 paragraph 6:33 the prophet of God says all powers in heaven and earth is given unto my hand and I'll go with you whatever you bind on earth I'll bind in heaven what you lose on earth I'll you lose in heaven &gt;&gt; oh if the great holy church only realized its power &gt;&gt; to do these things &gt;&gt; but there's so much doubt and fear and trembling wondering If it will, &gt;&gt; could it happen? As long as that exists, the church can never stand upright. &gt;&gt; And when every stock of fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church, then all fears are gone and that church has the power. &gt;&gt; You see, and when they have everything that heaven owns behind them, what a what a comfort this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. that we have everything that heaven owns behind us. &gt;&gt; And it says there are ambassadors of the throne. And and I just love this concept of ambassador. &gt;&gt; I just love it so much because you know an ambassador of a country represents that country in that foreign land. &gt;&gt; So as ambassadors of heaven, as ambassadors of the throne, we represent all that heaven is. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and he says an ambassador of Christ has the authority &gt;&gt; and everything that Christ owns belongs to that ambassador. &gt;&gt; That is the church of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That everything that Christ owns &gt;&gt; belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As representatives, as ambassadors, that's why when he says all power is given unto me, &gt;&gt; Yes. You know that that means all power is given unto you &gt;&gt; because you are his representative. You are his ambassador. And may may the Lord help us to recognize that position. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As ambassadors of heaven as ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ. And that all fear and trembling is removed. All doubt is removed. &gt;&gt; That we can receive this word and that it may anchor in our souls and reveal to us who we are. Because that's really what the message of the hour has come to do. It's come to reveal Christ. And by revealing Christ as we know that he was the mystery of God revealed, we are the mystery of Christ. [applause] &gt;&gt; He has come to reveal himself through the bride. &gt;&gt; And and that's why that you know we are him in blind form. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and that's that's what and it is that revelation that that anchors in your soul and that is it's the power of that revelation that will change your body one and that's that's really what God is concentrating on that's what God is focused on to make us see who we are &gt;&gt; because when that revelation drops this body will just not take it anymore so much of power of this revelation that this body will just not take him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and we are taught by the prophet that there were three raptures in the Old Testament &gt;&gt; and and and three raptures in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and we are taught that in the Old Testament, the three raptures, Enoch, Elijah, and the Lord Jesus Christ and the Lord Jesus Christ as the prophet calls him as the keystone. &gt;&gt; Keystone &gt;&gt; linking the Old Testament and the New Testament. and uh and and what we just want to look at this morning, the Lord being gracious to us, is is just to look at what was happening in in in those other raptures &gt;&gt; that are help because we are focused on making sure that we're ready for &gt;&gt; there's nothing else that should we should worry about that we should care about but to make sure that we have everything in us that will change these bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and that's why, you know, the prophet of God tells us, you know, it doesn't matter how good of a person you are, how how much you come to church and do all of those things. It's not that. &gt;&gt; It must be something on the inside &gt;&gt; and it must be him on the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. Much as it was him in the inside of the prophet bringing this message, it must be him in you receiving this message. &gt;&gt; Because the true revelation of the word of God is God himself in you receiving his own way. &gt;&gt; Because you you and I as in our own human ways and forms, we have no capacity to receive the way. &gt;&gt; We have no capacity to to even receive revelation. That's why the Lord Jesus Christ said, "Flesh and blood never reveal to you, but my father." &gt;&gt; So it has to be the father in you, &gt;&gt; the one revealing the word to himself, &gt;&gt; the one receiving the word in you. And that's what we have come to in the hour that we're living in. So we we see that Enoch, the Bible teaches us that he walked with God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He walked pleasingly before [clears throat] God. He he anchored the word in his heart and he was normal. And we know that he was the seventh from Adam. &gt;&gt; And being the seventh, we are taught by the prophet that it's a type of us. &gt;&gt; He's a type of the seventh church age. &gt;&gt; Showing that the seventh church age represents people who will not die. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because there will be no other age hereafter. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that afterwards was the destruction by by Noah's message. And and we you know the Bible shows us and and and we are we read it in Jude that he was the seventh from Adam and you can count it you know Adam and Seth and Enoch. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ken and all of those all the way down to to to Enoch and Enoch becomes the seventh one. And the Bible says when you read in in verse 5 of Genesis chapter 5 we've read that even Adam &gt;&gt; died. He he and we all know, you know, he came straight from the hand of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But he died. &gt;&gt; He died. &gt;&gt; And Seth died. All of the other six died. &gt;&gt; And when he gets to the seventh, it just says he was no more &gt;&gt; because what? God took him. &gt;&gt; He was raptured. And Hebrews tells us that he was translated. &gt;&gt; He was raptured. And you know, the prophet tells us that the word rapture is not even in the Bible. It's a translation. Is a change. is a catching away. That's what that's what that word means and that's what Enoch that's what happened to Enoch and him representing us &gt;&gt; and you know so all of those other six who died was a representation of the six church ages &gt;&gt; but then when it comes to the seventh it's a translation is a change but it's of a people who walk with God &gt;&gt; and and and [laughter] and the Bible says here testimony that he pleased God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that without faith it's impossible to &gt;&gt; and we know that faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; And that's what God has come to do today is to reveal himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the the opening of the seals is to reveal Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what because he is the seals that were revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the revelation of the se is none but Christ himself. &gt;&gt; That's why you know the prophet of God tells us that it cannot bring something else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can be some other thing that is outside of the word. &gt;&gt; And I love how you know and I I believe person that the the brother who was telling the prophet you know you know but what about the the seven thunders? &gt;&gt; Yes. Wouldn't that be some something that you know God gives you? And the prophet of God says, "No, no, no. It can't be." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says it was all revealed in the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It has to line up with the word &gt;&gt; because you can't add to the word. You can't take away from the word. &gt;&gt; So the message that we have received is the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why you know when you when you read any part of the spoken word &gt;&gt; you know you can't read a paragraph &gt;&gt; that is not a reference to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Every part of what the prophet was bringing is reference to the scripture. &gt;&gt; It's all the unfolding of the Bible. Something new that the prophet came to tell us. &gt;&gt; It's just Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. because he it was the restoration &gt;&gt; of what had through the dark ages the seed had to fall into the ground. &gt;&gt; But through the re reformers was just the sprouting of that seed and and and and as it was coming up but in this age it's the seed that went into the ground. Amen. That's what we see today. So it must be the word again. And that's why the prophet says in in in in the spoken of the reference says now we find here that Enoch was a seventh from Noah and you know the people that the pastor was talking about will take this one and say ah the prophet made a mistake there. You &gt;&gt; see that's right &gt;&gt; we know he's a seventh from Adam. We know that's we know it is. So it's not some new thing that you think you found. No. Which was a type of the church ages. Now all the rest of the six men before him died. But Enoch was translated. Inoqua's rapture, the seven showing that it's the seventh church age that takes the rapture. Now, there's no doubt we're in the seventh church age. We all know it. Now, it's the seventh church age that takes the rapture. All of the other six died, but Enoch was translated because he was not found. God took him, &gt;&gt; but Enoch raptured was a type of all of the rest of them dying. But the end time bride will be called out &gt;&gt; the rapturing without death will be called out of the seven which are now bearing record of that age. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and you know how allow how the prophets oh my let's dig in now real deep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what you know the the wonderful thing about the message is exactly that there's no part of the message that is hidden from us. Yes, &gt;&gt; there's nothing that is maybe too deep that's still not revealed. Everything has been revealed. &gt;&gt; There is no part that remains hidden to the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's why we can go real deep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To any part of the message and go and take those nuggets that will build the rapturing faith on the inside. &gt;&gt; And and in God's power to transform, it says Enoch was translated from death by God's transforming power. Paragraph 252. What did God do that for? For a type of the rapturing church that is coming, which is us. &gt;&gt; And he says, yeah, Elijah was the same because he was now that second type of the rapture in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; And and and that's why we said, you know, the Bible tells us that, you know, pleased God. &gt;&gt; And for us to please God is to walk by faith, to keep the word in our hearts. And and he says the same in in paragraph 252 of the same spoken word, God's power to transform. He says that word has to come to pass. It's God's word planted in your heart if you want to go in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For you to go in the rapture, what you need to plant in your heart is &gt;&gt; the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Nothing else but the word. &gt;&gt; The word is the pill. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; The word is the medicine. Yes, &gt;&gt; that knows how to change this body. &gt;&gt; No other medicine can you take to change the body. But the word has got the power to change the body to translate. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and we see that you know and we see it right throughout the scripture. When those who receive the word, something happens on the inside because the power of transformation is in the way. If you want to be Christians genuine, plays this way. Yes. &gt;&gt; Because Ezekiel said in Ezekiel 2, take that scroll and eat it up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the prophet and the word will be the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and that's why that's why Revelation 10:8 now referencing us that we must eat the book also and so that we and the book can become the same. &gt;&gt; We and the word can become the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now watch the word in the bride. &gt;&gt; And and and that's why the Bible say the prophet of God says for the bride who has become the word &gt;&gt; there's been a complete atonement &gt;&gt; because she has become the word &gt;&gt; and the word is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word became flesh &gt;&gt; and and and dwelt among us. And and that's why you know I always say that you know I've been to to to Israel. I've been to to the streets of Nazareth. Why? Because I was in him when he was walking those streets &gt;&gt; because he hadn't the bride hadn't been taken out of him yet. &gt;&gt; And when he was walking the streets, I was in him because I am a part of it. &gt;&gt; I am that way. &gt;&gt; In him was the fullness of the way. &gt;&gt; And that's why, you know, the prophet of God, you know, some of these things I I say that's why the prophet takes it an octave higher because he says you died for your own sins. &gt;&gt; How so? because you were in him when he died. So because you were in him, you died for your own sins. You paid for your own atonement and therefore there's no more tribulation for you because you are the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; And and the bride of Christ, as the prophet of God says, the church of the word in the church making it the bride. &gt;&gt; So it's when the word comes in and becomes flesh in you that makes you the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Without the word, you are just a church, just a called out. But when the word comes in and becomes flesh in you, you [applause] become the bride. &gt;&gt; Because he is the he the way. So being the bridegroom being the word for you to be his bride, you must be the word also. &gt;&gt; If if the the groom was the word made flesh, what must the bride be? &gt;&gt; She must be the word made flesh also. &gt;&gt; He can't be married to something that is not himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; He can only unite with a part that it says the striking of Adam was for a purpose &gt;&gt; to take out of him a a a bride. And it was the same with the striking of the second egg was to take out of him the the bride. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says in in in I love it here in God's provided place of worship paragraph 40 650425 he says let's take a man here that kept all of the word of God back in the Old Testament by the name of Enoch. [clears throat] He was quickened by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What quickened him? &gt;&gt; What translated him? What raptured him was the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's what that was his transport. That's what that's what he stepped on as he was walking on up was the way. &gt;&gt; Because he had kept that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says that [clears throat] he the testimony that he pleased God. There wasn't one thing that God commanded Enoch to do, but what he did. Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's what must be the same with you and I. &gt;&gt; Whatever God commands us to do, we do. &gt;&gt; And and and whatever the word says you must do, we do. &gt;&gt; And and we can only do so when it's the word itself in you living itself. &gt;&gt; Because on our own we the sticky nature is always there. &gt;&gt; But it must be the word on the inside and that word can live itself out. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then it becomes it's you know the supernatural becomes natural to &gt;&gt; because you you are a supernatural being God in you &gt;&gt; and that becomes normal and ordinary to you to live for God. &gt;&gt; Everything else is what actually is foreign to you. &gt;&gt; And and he says in paragraph 141 he says I wonder how many Enochs will be here this morning. He says this afternoon but I wonder how many Enochs are here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you know it's in the word of God, how many of you bothered women could call yourself an inoist? I love that word. An &gt;&gt; inoist. &gt;&gt; We must be inocists this morning. &gt;&gt; People who are just like Enoch. &gt;&gt; See, and know that God condemns that. You know, we as an enoist, you can do something that that God condemns. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you men let them women do that could call yourself an Enoch? M &gt;&gt; that's what that that's you know I always say that you know sometimes we we we label ourselves incorrectly if I can call it that what God has called us to be is to be Christians &gt;&gt; and Christian is to be Christlike &gt;&gt; and it's not some label called the message the message is what we have believed but what the message makes you is to be a Christian &gt;&gt; because that's what God has called you to be to be Christlike here on the face of the And so that's what we see that the man who got raptured first right in the book of Genesis is one who walked with God. Is one who kept the word of God. Is the one who absolutely revered the word of God and walked pleasingly before God. &gt;&gt; And that word is what changed him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it must be therefore the same with us that the key to rapture is for us to keep the word in the heart. &gt;&gt; Nothing else but that word. &gt;&gt; The word. &gt;&gt; And that's what God has come to do with this message was to restore the word &gt;&gt; because a lot had been called the word. &gt;&gt; Many things had been called the word. But God had to send a prophet because the word of the Lord only comes to a prophet. Not a reformer but a prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; And a prophet, a prophet is a revealer of the divine word of God. That's what a prophet is. A prophet, that's why the prophet says, you know, when a prophet stands and says, "Thus sayeth the Lord," he takes the place of God. &gt;&gt; It's God speaking through a man. &gt;&gt; And and that's why he doesn't say, "Thus sayaith Elijah," he says, "Thus sayaith the Lord." &gt;&gt; Meaning what I'm about to say is God speaking to me. It's not me. It's God speaking. And so if we go to to to to the book of first kings and if we just want to go to the second one second one who was raptured Elijah and and we will just maybe start in verse 13 of first Kings chapter 17 and we know the story of of of Elijah very well but there just a few things that I I just want us to look at verse 13 of first kings chapter 17 Well, well familiar scripture, you always say that if a minister comes with some other things that your pastor is not teaching, that's the one you must be suspicious of, not get too excited. Ah, this brother has some. No, no, no. It's exactly what your your pastor God has placed him here to teach you the word of God. It mustn't be some other person who brings some foreign thing to you. And Elijah said unto her, "Fear not. Go and do as thou has said, but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me. For thus say the Lord of Israel, the barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cru of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. &gt;&gt; She went and did according to the saying of Elijah. &gt;&gt; And she and and he and her house did it many days. And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruise of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In verse 24, it says, "And the woman said unto Elijah, now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. So I I I love I love just references to the scripture that we've just read of how you know God's word was coming through his prophet. &gt;&gt; It was the word of God being spoken by Elijah. And that's why you know it says she went and did according to what Elijah said. Yes, &gt;&gt; she went and did and and and the barrel and the cruise of oil, all of those nothing wasted because of the word of the Lord that he spake through Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the and the woman says, "No, I know that the word of God is in your mouth." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If that is not the third pool, then what is? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What what what Elijah was doing here again is an example of one who got raptured. The second example of one who got raptured in the Old Testament, he manifested the third book. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And what was that? God speaking through a man again and bringing things to pass. And as as we were saying, it's the same with the bride today. Because it's the bride who has become the word. &gt;&gt; It must be the bride who becomes the word. Now it's the word of God being spoken through the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why our pastor quoted it that we under our messenger have become the final voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the final voice of God is who? It's us in this age under our messenger. And that's why Revelation 21:17 the prophet calls it that the spirit and the bride say come. &gt;&gt; So it's the bride speaking in this age &gt;&gt; as that final voice. You know the prophet of God says we are predestinated with our messenger. &gt;&gt; We come as a package. I love that so much. &gt;&gt; We we are predestinated with our prophet. &gt;&gt; We come with him. WE ARE REPRESENT. THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW WHEN HE WENT TO THE sixth dimension he said are all these breads where they sure are. &gt;&gt; They all come represented under his ministry &gt;&gt; because we are predestinated as a package under him. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and the prophet of God says, you know, it's the voice of God in her. &gt;&gt; So in the bride, it's not her speaking, it's the voice of God speaking through her and she has become that final voice because why? She has the word because the prophet again says the word is in the bride. &gt;&gt; That's what where the word is today is in the bride. And we know that God is a dispensational God. You know, for you to to to know where he is, you must receive him by revelation. &gt;&gt; You know, therefore, the prophet of God says, you know, if if he was here this morning wearing this suit that he gave me, I love how he says it. He says, "If he was here this morning wearing this suit that he gave me and you came to him and said, "Oh Lord Jesus, please heal me." He'll say, "No, no, no, no, son. No, daughter. I've already done it. He &gt;&gt; He can't do any more than he's already done. &gt;&gt; It's already paid for. It's done. It's for you and I to receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why, you know, he says if he came here with a long robe and a long beard, he says I wouldn't receive him. No, no, no, no. That's what the prophet of God says. Because that's not what the promise of this age is. &gt;&gt; That he'll come here like that man from Galilee. the man of Galilee. He has become the men and women of Phoenix in the age that we are living in. That's where he has come to represent himself. &gt;&gt; That's where he is walking today. &gt;&gt; He's walking the streets of Phoenix and it's him in you and I. &gt;&gt; He's not going to come as anything else today. &gt;&gt; And and that's why, you know, he always says that if he was to come today, he would look just like you. And that's how he came to the house of Abraham. When he went to the house of Abraham, the prophet teaches us that he had dust on his feet. He [laughter] blended in. He looked exactly like the people of the field of Abraham. &gt;&gt; So when THE PEOPLE PASSED BY WITH NO REVELATION, they just saw a visitor in the house of Abraham. They did not know that Elohim himself had come to the house of Abraham. &gt;&gt; And what had he come to do? He had come with a message for a body chain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THAT MESSAGE WAS THAT HE he went to bring to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was him again &gt;&gt; that Elohim. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; IN FLESH &gt;&gt; WITH ONE message to for a message THAT THEY MUST RECEIVE FOR A BODY CHANGE. [laughter] &gt;&gt; AND AS IT WAS, SO IT IS TODAY. He has to MANIFEST HIMSELF AS THAT ONE WHO TURNS THE same one manifesting the same gift to show that he is the son of man again today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And through that ministry of the son of man through that ministry of the opening of the seventh seal he's ministering the same thing to you and I today &gt;&gt; a message [clears throat] for a body change. &gt;&gt; Preparing us for that rapture for that body change. That's what he's focused on. He's that's why you know the prophet of God says you know the first pool second pool those that's just to draw the attention of the people but the third pool is the opening of the way. &gt;&gt; That's what the first two are forerunner of the third &gt;&gt; for you to see exactly what he wants you to see &gt;&gt; in the age that we are living in. And h and and we know that Elijah also came in the time of Jezebel. The same spirit that we seeing in the age that we are living in Elijah comes in in that circumstance when that is the the the the spirit prevailing at a time of Jezebel. Elijah comes and what does he come to do? He comes to return their hearts back to God. Let's read in revelation in in in in first Kings chapter 18 and maybe let's just read from verse 19 to 22 and then we'll go down to verse 29 and just to see again h you know how God is giving these things as an example to us to see what he was doing then is what he's doing to us here and and I I believe that's why the Bible says WE HAVE A CLOUD OF witnesses &gt;&gt; glory &gt;&gt; you know and the prophet of what I love how he says you know that woman with a blood issue. She had no reference point. &gt;&gt; She she had did not read anywhere that I can touch the hem of his garment and then my my healing will come through. No, there's no scripture that said that to her. BUT BY FAITH, &gt;&gt; SHE REACHED OUT AND TOUCHED THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT. &gt;&gt; BUT OUR BROTHER, SISTER, YOU AND I, WE HAVE A CLOUD OF GOODNESS. &gt;&gt; WE have a a REFERENCE POINT. WE HAVE SOMETHING TO ANCHOR OUR FAITH ON. THE word of God &gt;&gt; is all here given to us so that we can position ourselves. WE CAN KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE CAN KNOW WHERE WE ARE. WE CAN KNOW WHERE WE COME FROM, WHERE WE GOING. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO NEED TO BE CONFUSED. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO US. HE HAS GIVEN IT ALL to us in the age that we are living in. &gt;&gt; So, and there are so many things we can can pick up any scripture and you see yourself in that scripture. And that's why the prophet says if you open a new part of the Bible and you don't see Christ read it again &gt;&gt; because it's the revelation of Jesus Christ if it's revealing Christ is revealing you. &gt;&gt; You must see yourself &gt;&gt; because he's a central theme of the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; You are the central theme of the entire Bible. THAT'S WHAT GOD has come to do in the whole thing was to come and reveal a bride. &gt;&gt; The bride who will not fail, &gt;&gt; who will manifest the final victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. First Kings 18:1 19 the Bible says now therefore send and gather to me all Israel unto Mount K and the prophets of Bal 450 and the prophets of the groves 400 total of 850 prophets &gt;&gt; all gathered there against one vindicated prophet of God &gt;&gt; which is a Jezebel house all of these were under a Jezebel spell &gt;&gt; like all these so-called prophets that we see in the age that we living being &gt;&gt; influenced by absolute wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; And and as the Bible says to us, it's Matthew 24:24. &gt;&gt; If it were possible, they will deceive the very elect. But we, YOU AND I ARE THE VERY ELECT. WE'RE NOT JUST THE ELECT. WE ARE THE VERY ELECT. &gt;&gt; As the very elect, we can't be deceived. &gt;&gt; We can differentiate the two spirits. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW MANY PROPHETS THERE MAY BE, WE CAN KNOW THE ONE TRUE PROPHET. AMEN. &gt;&gt; VINDICATED. WHY? Because the Bible tells us that it must be the word test. &gt;&gt; That's what God CARES ABOUT IS HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; That's the only test you and I give any of his is the word test. Everything must line up with the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or we leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together unto Mount Carmel. And Elijah came unto all the people and said, "HOW LONG SHALL he &gt;&gt; between [clears throat] sh how long halt ye between two opinions? &gt;&gt; If the LORD BE GOD, FOLLOW HIM." &gt;&gt; But if Bal then follow him, and the people answered him, not a word. And then Elijah said unto the people, I even I only remain a prophet unto the Lord, but B's prophets are 450 men. &gt;&gt; And and and then we know, let's go to verse 29, we know what then happens there with the bullocks and and and the great Mount Carmel showed up. But uh from verse 29 the Bible says and and it came to pass when midday was passed and they and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. So Elijah had to wait for a particular time which was an evening time. &gt;&gt; And here we are sitting in the evening time. We are evening time people in in this hour. &gt;&gt; And he say there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded. And Elijah said unto all the people, "Come near unto me." And all the people came near unto him, and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. That's exactly what the prophet had come to do. Yes. Worship had been broken. &gt;&gt; He had come to restore worship. &gt;&gt; But more importantly, come to restore the way. &gt;&gt; That's what the message is, is to back to THE WAY. &gt;&gt; MALACHIAH 4 IS BACK TO THE WAY. &gt;&gt; That's what he had come to do in this age. And Elijah took 12 stones representing the 12 tribes of Israel, &gt;&gt; unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name. &gt;&gt; And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord, and he and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed. And he put the wood in order and cut the bulocks in pieces and laid him. And we won't go into all of those things because that's not really what we we are speaking on this morning. And he said, "Do it the second time." And they did it the third time. And all of these things, he said, verse 36, "And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice." Yes. &gt;&gt; Then Elijah the prophet came near and said unto the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, &gt;&gt; and that I am thy servant, &gt;&gt; and that I have done all these things at thy word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou has turned their heart again. Yes, &gt;&gt; we see Malachi fall there again. &gt;&gt; What is Elijah doing? Turning the heart. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says the heart, we must be of one heart, of one accord, the same one faith, one Lord, one baptism &gt;&gt; under one messenger. So turning the heart exactly the same as what we have received in this age. Um and and he says, "And then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the bent sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces. They said, "The Lord, he is the God. The Lord, he is the God." and and may the Lord help us that you know having seen the full manifestation of the word in the age that we live having seen this Elijah of our day restoring the word restoring worship restoring the altar and turning the heart back to the Pentecostal fathers that we may now worship God truly &gt;&gt; worship God the correct way because worship has been restored and and and we we know that you Now with Elijah came Elisha who was his successor as as as we are taught in in second Kings. And the same ministry that you see in Elijah, you see in Elisha &gt;&gt; Elisha just does exactly as Elijah did. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God shows us, you know, how and in fact, in fact, let's let's maybe just read a a couple of parts um in in in 2 Kings chapter 2 verse 21-22. I I just want to uh catch something here. And it says 21:22, "And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there. And he said, "Thus say the Lord, I have healed these waters, and there shall not be from thence anymore death or barren land." So the waters were healed unto this day according to the saying of Elijah which he spake. And and and so what what is it that we seeing again? The same representation of the word of the final voice been through Elisha who is Elijah's successor. We must see in the bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; And uh and and and the prophet of God says something here that's really wonderful which I I hope we see sorry the Bible the prophet say God in simplicity he says God taking the humble sinner and cleansing him by his blood and dropping that confessed sin into that chlorox bleach of the blood of son of god bleach of the son of god and putting his own life into that man &gt;&gt; by the baptism of the holy ghost. &gt;&gt; Then if we have a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost, what's wrong with us? When the type when Elijah dropped the rope for Elisha, he got a double portion of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "The work that I do shall you do also, &gt;&gt; and greater than this shall you do, for I go to my father." &gt;&gt; Amen. And what the prophet of God as we know many many times when he quotes this scripture he says no there can be no greater work that we can do &gt;&gt; because there can be nobody who can do greater works than than him but you know when when God corrected his prophet in the spoken of shalom both shalom messages he says you know I've and he says so himself he says I've said many times I have corrected that from greater to more &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and he says No, no, no. But it actually is greater. And he says, you know, when he was here on earth, he took a fish that already existed and he multiplied it. &gt;&gt; He took bread which was there already, multiplied it. Took water which was water already, turned it into wine. But he says in my ministry when there was no squirrel there, he spoke the squirrel. Hallelujah. call it what? Greater works. &gt;&gt; Because now it's the double portion of Elijah's ministry that must also be in us. &gt;&gt; We must absolutely manifest the same power in us today because what the Lord Jesus Christ did, he must do greater in our ministry. when he is manifesting himself as the bride &gt;&gt; because Elisha and the prophet says it many times that Elijah and Elisha is a type of Christ and the bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So what he did in Christ he must do greater in the bride. What he what what we saw him manifesting here we must see more of in the bride. And he says in letting of the pressure he says look here as Elijah that great prophet a type of Christ Elisha a type of the church which a double portion of the spirit come upon the prophet he walked to the Jordan one day a type of this day the government and things that we have now Ahab Jezeb there circumstances the spirit everything that you see in that time is what we seeing today the same spirit the government everything is Ahab is exactly the same as we what we are seeing today and then Elijah comes on the scene &gt;&gt; because there must be a rapture that takes place &gt;&gt; and remember my my Jezebel sermon notice when Elisha following Elijah for a reason. Amen. Where did he take him to? To Jordan to Ramoth Gillad up to the school of the prophets and on down to Jordan. That's where that's the way he takes you also through justification, sanctification, and to die out to receive life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and we know that, you know, we just read where he says, you know, when when he takes you through that bleach, that Clorox so that in you may be his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for that to happen, you must die to yourself. &gt;&gt; And that's why the Bible says you must be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there must be a new birth. The old man must die with his deeds as the Bible says so that there must be a new man who after the image of the one who created the the new man on the inside is made of the image of the creator which is exactly what God was doing in the garden back in Genesis chapter one as the prophet of God says it's as if he was learning more and more and more but what he was looking at was to see a man in his own image. God was looking to see himself. &gt;&gt; And that's what God wants to see in you and I today is to see himself in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and then you know a perfect type of the church and Christ. And he says um the same with we're looking at Elijah and the prophet of God says in spiritual food and juices in paragraph 96 says and notice before the drought begin Elijah went into this place of secret for his living a very type of before the judgment starts to strike the earth. The church is already called out. The blind is already chosen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And just waiting before the judgment strikes and waiting, eating the food of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we are eating, brother. Is what? The food of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE FOOD OF GOD? IS it full revelation? &gt;&gt; What the prophet calls the seven course meal. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the prophet says they ate rabbits in the other church ages, but you and I here are eating a seven course meal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love it. And when he calls it what? It's the food of God. &gt;&gt; That's what the food of God is not a a you know the prophet says you can't measure in miners. &gt;&gt; It must be the message that comes after the healing service. &gt;&gt; That's what we are feasting on today. the food of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Enjoying the blessings of God. The same way that Elijah, he had to go before the drought came. The Bible says he and [laughter] we we know the story of how he was sustained by the Romans or he was sustained by the widow. We know that and the prophet of God is saying he was a type of us that in this you know and and and we know in Amos chapter 8. Let's read it so that we connect these things to see what kind of drought are we talking about which is the Bible puts it very well here in Amos 8:1 that you know there shall come a drought a thirst and this hunger and it won't be a a a physical hunger and the Bible says in Amos chapter 8 vers 11 and 12 says behold the days come sayaeth the Lord and I will send a famine in the and not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north, even to the east, and they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it. &gt;&gt; But we thank God THAT FOR THE BRIDE OF CHRIST, THE FOOD OF GOD HAS BEEN PROVIDED. &gt;&gt; OH, STORE UP THE FOOD. WE ARE EATING ON THE STORED UP FOOD IN THIS LAND because we like Elijah HAS BEEN SET ASIDE THAT in the end when there's this drought and famine in the land people are JUST TRYING TO CREATE THEIR OWN things &gt;&gt; even dare I say in what is called a message &gt;&gt; people I don't know I think they get bored with just focusing on the WORD OF GOD THEY WANT SOME FANTASTIC things [laughter] but that's not what God has promised us brother sister he has promised us his word &gt;&gt; the Message of the hour is to restore the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet OF GOD SAYS, "I WONDER IF YOU ARE SUFFICIENTLY &gt;&gt; IMPRESSED BY THE [clears throat] WORD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Sufficiently must doesn't just impress YOU A LITTLE BIT. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST BE sufficiently impressed by the word. &gt;&gt; THE WORD MUST BE ALL that impress you &gt;&gt; because there's A HUNGER OUT THERE. AND GOD, LIKE HE DID WITH ELIJAH before he raptured him, what did he do? He set him aside &gt;&gt; and he sustained himself. &gt;&gt; And that's what he's DOING TODAY WITH HIS OWN BRIDE. &gt;&gt; He is sustaining us himself. &gt;&gt; Giving us what? The food of God. &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord in THIS HOUR, THE REVELATION of the word, &gt;&gt; not some gimmick that we need to try and manufacture. But we must stay under the sun, the S O N of God until we ripen. &gt;&gt; Stay right under this ministry. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; STAY RIGHT UNDER this word. &gt;&gt; It has [clears throat] this THE KEY FOR A BODY CHANGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's How many years did Abraham and Sarah have to wait for the promise to COME TO PASS? 25 YEARS. &gt;&gt; And Noah had to preach 120 years. YES, &gt;&gt; BUT HOLD ON &gt;&gt; SOON AND VERY SOON like our pastor said on this much greater distance that HAS BEEN COVERED GOD AND YOU KNOW I was I was I was a a a speaking to a man of God last year sometime who has been in the message for 50 years I'm not even 50 years he has been preaching for 50 years in the message and he told me something that really struck my heart and he he he said that you He can see after all these years, he can see the progression of the revelation. &gt;&gt; What they saw and what they could see in the message back then &gt;&gt; to what God is doing today is not the same. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A GREAT OUTPOURING OF REVELATION HAPPENING TODAY. &gt;&gt; AND YOU AND I MUST NOT MISS IT. BROTHER, I WANT TO HOLD ON TO SOME OLD. NO, NO. GOD, REVELATION IS ALIVE. &gt;&gt; And and with with life there is growth. And that's why these kids are as TALL AS THEY ARE NOW. THERE'S GROWTH BECAUSE THEY ARE ALIVE. And you and I also, you know, there must be something that we are seeing happening in our OWN LIVES &gt;&gt; THAT GOD IS JUST SHOWING US MORE and more and more in this way &gt;&gt; because he's sustaining us. He's preparing us for a body change &gt;&gt; like he did Elijah of old who is a type of us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And and and and Yeah. And so I love how the prophet of God puts it here. It really is just so so so wonderful that you know we are eating what? The food of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know um and the bride already chosen already waiting enjoying the blessings of God you know and and he says you know with with even with your model normal mind you can see that we headed straight to the hour of jment. You can see you can just see that things cannot can continue for much longer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something has to something has to give &gt;&gt; and and and and and that is us giving way for destruction to come through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride has to leave because for the bride you must receive the word complete atonement. &gt;&gt; We're not going through the tribulation period. &gt;&gt; We shall go to the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, with our Lord up there &gt;&gt; when he comes to reveal himself to his brethren, the Jews &gt;&gt; through what? The same message. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal for us, the seventh trumpet for them, &gt;&gt; revealing what? Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ being revealed, &gt;&gt; showing them who he is. And God's provided place of worship. Again, paragraph 146 is the prophet of God says, "And one day he got so tired that God sent a cher down from heaven and horses of fire and took him up." He was so full of that quickening power. &gt;&gt; Trusting the with THE WORD OF GOD IN his heart. &gt;&gt; The quickening power was the word of God in his heart. &gt;&gt; That is what was the quickening power. That was the chariot that came to take him up was the word in his heart. He become so full of quickening power that it quickened him. &gt;&gt; The rapture, the spoken rapture, paragraph 151, the prophet of God says, notice, we find out that this great quickening power struck Enoch. &gt;&gt; It quickened him. It quickened him and he went home without dying. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Yes. And you know, you see how God somehow just made it thus that for all the years of the prophet's ministry, he waited until the last few days to preach THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; JUST RIGHT TOWARDS THE END, &gt;&gt; SHOW THAT it's it's the final thing that he must bring what this rapture is. Right towards the end it struck Elijah quickened him till he went home without dying. &gt;&gt; We find out his successor was Elijah which is a type there of Christ and a church. &gt;&gt; Elisha. Now remember in Christ we are flesh of his flesh, bone of his bones. &gt;&gt; We when God wounded Christ at Calvary, he was wounded for me and you. Yes, &gt;&gt; we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone, body of his body, &gt;&gt; name of his name. The whole family in heaven and on earth is called by his name. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE ARE. WE ARE CALLED BY HIS NAME. &gt;&gt; We are Mrs. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; WE ARE IDENTIFIED IN WHEN WE together talk about our identity. &gt;&gt; That's what that's what we must see our identity. When you take out the identity card, it must show Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Mrs. Jesus Christ. That's who we are. &gt;&gt; He was wounded for me and we are flesh of his flesh. Bone of his bone, born of name on it, bride of him. So we are in him. We are his flesh and his bones. And God has already raised us up because of this quickening power of the word that is in us. The promise SAYS GOD HAS RAISED UP potential because the power to change you is in you. &gt;&gt; And we know how that you know I love the reason I always say that I love reading these quotations and reading the Bible because I find that I can't put anything better than what the prophet puts it. &gt;&gt; I can't put it better than what the prophet puts it. &gt;&gt; So I find even the prophet gives us all the examples, you know, all of these things. We find it all in the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And how you know if you have five rand and you want to go buy okay bread is not about five rand but yeah okay [laughter] if you have 20 rand and you want to buy bread and you are hungry when you have the 20 rand you potentially have bread &gt;&gt; because you have the means to buy the bread &gt;&gt; and that's [clears throat] what the prophet of God is saying here God has already raised us up potentially why because the quickening power to change these bodies is already in you &gt;&gt; the quickening power that that's why the Bible says in the same spirit &gt;&gt; that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you &gt;&gt; it will quicken your mortal body &gt;&gt; and that same spirit is is in you and I today &gt;&gt; it has potentially raised us up in Christ Jesus which the resurrection will bring us forth in the full maturity &gt;&gt; so we are already potentially what the resurrection and the change of body will be the full potential of it. &gt;&gt; But what we what we need for that, we have. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And and and for you to be in there, you must have it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Much like the 10 virgins, you know, they were all in the same place, all having received the message, all having kept themselves clean, they were virgins. They believed that he was coming. They believe that the rapture is coming. But one set of virgins did not have this quickening power in. &gt;&gt; And without that, no matter how much under expectation they said, no matter how much they believed in his coming, without the potentials, &gt;&gt; they had no they had no part. When the bridegroom came, they had no part. They couldn't take part in the resurrection because they did not have oil in their lamps. They did not have the spirit of the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; And I love how the prophet of God say he's improving his word. The bridegroom call will come right through this through this what is the ministry of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the bride the ministry of the right son of man is the bridegroom call. &gt;&gt; So it's for you to tune into the right channel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To hear the bridegroom call. &gt;&gt; Any other channel you won't hear it. Yes, &gt;&gt; YOU'LL BE LIKE THE FIVE FOOLISH virgins sitting right here in the church, &gt;&gt; believing that he's coming, believing the believing that God sent a prophet, living clean, but you miss the bridegroom call. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, sister, may God help us &gt;&gt; that we TUNE INTO THE RIGHT CHANNEL, &gt;&gt; that son of man channel, &gt;&gt; channel 777, &gt;&gt; the seven seal channel this morning, so that we can hear the bridegroom call. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The key for the rapture BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT GOD IS DOING TODAY IS PREPARING his bride for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says in the rapture again paragraph 40 he says it wouldn't have worked. Neither would Jesus message have ever worked of Moses and neither would West Wesley's message were ever worked in Luther or Luther's message vice versa. And today we our last great reformation was Pentecost. The prophet calls Pentecost a great reformation. &gt;&gt; So there must be the coming of the word after that because it's still part of the reformation, &gt;&gt; the restoration of the gifts. &gt;&gt; And today more we are moving from that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So we must move from that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Pentecostal message one mix with this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S ANOTHER DAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; John in Revelation 4:1, the prophet of God says he had just been LIFTED UP &gt;&gt; OUT OF THE SEVEN CHURCH AGES. &gt;&gt; There is a lifting up out of the seven churches for the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; John representing the bride [applause] being lifted UP OUT OF THE SEVEN CHURCH AGES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; For what? To receive &gt;&gt; the message for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We must be in a particular environment, a particular dimension &gt;&gt; for us to receive this. &gt;&gt; You know, Abraham and Lot were in the same area. &gt;&gt; We know that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham stood with the Lord &gt;&gt; and could see Sodom and Gomorrah and said, "No, but what if there's 40? What if there?" until finance. &gt;&gt; They could see they were in the same area but Abraham was not in the same dimension as Lord. &gt;&gt; His visitation was very different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What he was experiencing &gt;&gt; with Elohim made Christ in HIS HOME WAS VERY DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The message he received was very different. was a message that changed the body of &gt;&gt; and that's why when they went down the young king wanted to marry a 90 YEAR OLD WOMAN &gt;&gt; WHY BECAUSE HER body had been changed &gt;&gt; and as the prophet teaches us as a 90year-old woman there's no way she could bear birth pain &gt;&gt; so God had to change her body &gt;&gt; and it was that ministry &gt;&gt; OF GOD ELOHIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Coming down in flesh again, &gt;&gt; the son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; And it is that ministry that Luke 17 says, AS IT WAS, &gt;&gt; SO SHALL IT BE. &gt;&gt; And we say, as it was, so it is. &gt;&gt; That's what we are living through today. That is what the [applause] bride is experiencing today. &gt;&gt; Because it's another day. &gt;&gt; It's another dimension. lifted up out of the seven churches. &gt;&gt; We are not in theian condition. &gt;&gt; We are now condition. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; We are sitting under the ministry of the son of man. &gt;&gt; God himself has come down to come and reveal this whispering secret to his bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whom he has set aside, &gt;&gt; whom he is feeding and and and and and and filling with the power for a body change, &gt;&gt; whom he is transforming himself. &gt;&gt; So she must look exactly like him &gt;&gt; because we we we are holding [cheering and applause] there's a holding in happening. WHY? SO THAT we can connect with God. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God teaches us that &gt;&gt; he must find the same ministry. &gt;&gt; It must be the SAME MINISTRY IN THE BRIDE for it to connect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can't be anything else. It must be the same ministry. &gt;&gt; What he's what he comes to connect with is what he sees of himself. What made God to STOP IN GENESIS WAS when he saw himself, &gt;&gt; a man who reflected God. &gt;&gt; And that's what this connection, the union that takes place here is the manifestation OF THE REVELATION OF THE SON of God. &gt;&gt; Not just the manifestation thereof. &gt;&gt; That revelation must be made flesh in you and I. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTS TO UNITE WITH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Unites with a people on the face of the earth who look exactly like him, &gt;&gt; who have the same POWER, THE SAME THING, THE SAME POTENTIAL. &gt;&gt; SHE is him. &gt;&gt; The bride may &gt;&gt; bride has come on the scene. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To prepare. And God is preparing us for a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Focused on that for you and I. &gt;&gt; It's all the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it's building. No. So what he means is that all of those Luther WEST, IT'S ALL THE WORD OF GOD, but it's he's busy building. &gt;&gt; And he wants this building to be complete. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want it to end at the roof at at the the window or No, no, no. Then it's not a complete building. If you END ANYWHERE ELSE OR PENTECOST, NO, YOU ARE JUST AT the window level. Maybe you put no the slab. Maybe you put the slab on, it looks like, ah, oh, the slab is on. NO, THERE MUST BE A ROOF THAT comes on top &gt;&gt; and that head stone must come and connect &gt;&gt; to complete the building. &gt;&gt; Like the feet and arms coming up. It's forming a bride for what? For the rapture. &gt;&gt; See, they leave their message. All of them come out. That was in the bride. And and you know, let's just read it nicely and we we'll say something just now what the prophet show. Just like life going through a stock of wheat, it leaves the wheat, the hull, but the wheat forms itself like the gem of wheat that fell in the ground. That C of wheat that had fallen to the ground just like Jesus had to fall to rise again. So did the church of Pentecost had to fall. It had to go into the ground dark ages. Any grain that goes into the ground, it has to lay in the dark time to bring forth. But it started sprouting in Martin Luther come on through Wesley on out into Pentecost now in to go out to the grave. &gt;&gt; And now the denominational system that they left behind their stocks that's all is to be banned the denominational system. But the real grain of wheat that come out of each one of those reformations will be caught up in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. It all together will make the bride. &gt;&gt; But now we are the completion of THAT BRIDE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALL OF THE elected and and let in every church age there was a people let him that has an ear hear what the spirit let him that hear what the spirit say. So there were there were the the the elected out of each church age &gt;&gt; forming what? The bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are that final force. WE ARE THE COMPLETION OF THAT BRIDE. And that's why the Bible says Hebrews 11 &gt;&gt; that they without us may not be made. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God teaches us that the key for the resurrection is in the &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For for there to be a resurrection of the dead saints to listen to that voice as the pastor was saying. That's why I was saying all it's exciting when you hear a pastor coming to make opening remarks and he just it it encourages you that maybe that's what God wanted us to say this morning. And it's that voice, &gt;&gt; that same voice of the resurrection because we also know that there's three part the shout, the voice, and the trumpet. And it's all wrapped up in exactly the same ministry. &gt;&gt; Because the shout being the message, the the prophet of God says it's we who hold the key for their resurrection. Yes. &gt;&gt; Without us getting to our ought to be condition, &gt;&gt; they lay there. &gt;&gt; Without catching the revelation, they lay there. &gt;&gt; They without us are not made perfect. &gt;&gt; So we have to reach our perfection. And why is our perfection? The prophet says the ministry reaches perfection. When it reproduces Jesus Christ AGAIN &gt;&gt; IN HUMAN FORM. [applause] He must reproduce Jesus Christ again in HUMAN FORM. THAT IS THE perfection of the ministry. And it's that perfection that will then unlock the resurrection. &gt;&gt; The same voice that rose Lazarus up. &gt;&gt; Well, IT'S THE SAME VOICE THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO HEAR and is the same trumpet that ushers in what? The marriage supper. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL WRAPPED UP IN THE SAME MINISTRY OF Malachi 4. That's why the prophet says Jesus does all three as he's coming. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It's all in the same. It's not some other thing. It's the message that you and I have received &gt;&gt; in it. It's got everything. &gt;&gt; I mean everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the That's why the prophet says it's the same message that goes to the Jews. &gt;&gt; It's what the same message. Amen. &gt;&gt; The entire thing was revealed and completed in the message that you and I have revealed and received. &gt;&gt; And God is not going to add. He's not going to do anything else even when Moses and Elijah go because the the reason is Moses and Elijah even in the ministry [laughter] of our prophet was represented Moses ministry and Elijah's ministry &gt;&gt; in the ministry OF THE PROPHET. THAT'S WHY MALACHI 4:4 SAYS, "OH, remember ye the law of Moses before behold I SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET." IT'S REMEMBER THE LAW OF MOSES BECAUSE in the ministry of this Elijah will represent both Moses and Elijah &gt;&gt; and just so that maybe let's just go via that detour quickly to to see how you know when you read in the Bible you read in in the book of Exodus how Moses had to take the tabernacle out &gt;&gt; and he took it out and and how when he went in there the cloud came before the tabernacle and the people came out of their their their camp and beheld that cloud of fire on the door of the tabernacle. We read that scripture. I want to read it now. And and we read in marriage and divorce and many other spoken way the prophet of God when God spoke to him to reveal the truth behind marriage and divorce. &gt;&gt; He had to go to the mountain and what did they see? They saw the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; coming down to speak to the prophet &gt;&gt; and they the prophet of God says the children had to come out of school &gt;&gt; and to to witness God speaking to his prophet the same that he did to Moses. So the ministry of Moses and Elijah in the prophet &gt;&gt; and that's why I say everything was revealed and manifested in this message. &gt;&gt; And that's why it's the same that goes to the Jews with Moses and Elijah taking the same message to the Jews to go do what? Reveal Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; No other revelation. And that's why they'll say where did you get those? from the house of my friends. &gt;&gt; It's they will now receive their true atonement because they rejected the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. And now when they see like we Zechariah prophesied, they will see those nails and they they will receive their true atonement. &gt;&gt; The feast of atonement will then be celebrated because it will be restored by the ministry. And for us, we have seen it. We have received it because the prophet says for the bride who has become the word there's been a complete atonement. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We we when we see ourselves in the Lord Jesus Christ we see that he's already died for us. &gt;&gt; We see that you know when he died John chapter 1920 we see that you know they hadn't already pierced his side. So the spirit the water and the blood hadn't come out yet. The bride hadn't come out yet. And that's when he died. He He was already dead and you and I had died in him. &gt;&gt; In him &gt;&gt; and our atonement was paid for in him &gt;&gt; and therefore there's no more tribulation for us. &gt;&gt; That's why we just go to the marriage supper when he comes down to reveal himself. &gt;&gt; And what what is it? It's all together in this word of God. all together in the bride of Christ who has come to to for for her to be a representation or a manifestation of those types that we saw in Enoch, that we saw in Elijah, that we see in the Lord Jesus Christ, the three raptors in the Old Testament, all wrapped up and represented in us. &gt;&gt; The ministry that we have received is exactly what we see there. And and and [laughter] that's why I always say even when you look at the first rapture of the New Testament, which is Acts 1:9, the Old Testament saints, the the ones that walked the streets of Jerusalem, the Bible says, you know, that cloud that we see the catching of the Lord Jesus Christ. And pastor, don't excommunicate me, but I believe it was their theophonies &gt;&gt; that were represented in that cloud that went up in Acts 1:9. And I believe in that cloud of 1963 is our theophony because the the prophet tells us we bypassed our theophony. &gt;&gt; But for you to receive this message, you have to reconnect. You must hear from your theophony. That's why that's the only way you can recognize this message. It's when you have heard from your theophony. And it's that 1963 when Christ himself comes down and we are represented in him &gt;&gt; for us to see the message of the &gt;&gt; without you being represented in him. There's no other way. &gt;&gt; We have to have been in him to be there. &gt;&gt; There's no other way to to receive this message if you were not there. And and and let's read the final quotation before we close. And and and that's why you know even the for for you to receive what what was that seven sealed book &gt;&gt; and and we know the prophet of God teaches us that John must have seen his name in the book &gt;&gt; but what [laughter] the name that he saw wasn't John didn't it's not like John via some binoculars could see the book that the lamb took no it's not that HE SAW THE REVELATION &gt;&gt; OF he who he is in the book &gt;&gt; because that is what the book is. It's a re God sends a revelation to you. That is you seeing your name in the book. So the only way for you to receive the revelation of the seals is for you to be represent for your name to be in the book. There's no other way. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's why he says here um in identification paragraph 77 he says look to show it's the ones that he thought of his thoughts his attributes is the Christian of today. &gt;&gt; The thoughts before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's you and I today. &gt;&gt; Yes. those that were there before the foundation &gt;&gt; as attributes as thoughts in him. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; They are the only ones who are the Christians of today. &gt;&gt; They are the ones that have been prepared to receive this way. &gt;&gt; You are today, brother, sister, a prepared believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A vessel that God prepared to come and receive the message today to come and see the word revealed in your age. Because God God is not a haphazard God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God is a very particular God. God is a is a a clean shot. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why it says behold I sent to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Very particular. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you meet certain specifications. &gt;&gt; It's this message comes encrypted. &gt;&gt; It's got an encryption code in it and you must have the CODE TO DECIPHER THE encryption and that's the only way to receive it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Without you being that representation, you cannot decipher this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just too mysterious for anybody to believe. &gt;&gt; But it's for you and I &gt;&gt; who have like that woman of at the well, &gt;&gt; she had a representation. And that's why even when the priests and the high priests could not see him, they called him Bianab and all, she could recognize him as the Messiah &gt;&gt; because of the representation. She had something on the inside that could connect with the Messiah &gt;&gt; that could decipher that. No, no, no. This one is not a son of Joseph and Mary. This is Messiah. [applause] This is God [cheering] made flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's you and I today. Something on the inside THAT SHOWS US A THIS IS THE WAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; This is the truth of the hour. This is who I am. This is revealing [laughter] you to you. &gt;&gt; And God has so blessed you and I that we can see these things, brother, sister, in a in a in in such a a marvelous and special and and unique and and and particular way. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. IT'S NOT JUST A GENERAL REVELATION. NO, NO, NO. It's a particular revelation to you and I that he has sent to us in this hour. And we can just thank him for what he has done. May God, [applause] &gt;&gt; we are so grateful this morning for what you've done. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. We are grateful that we can identify ourselves with this word Lord. &gt;&gt; Not because of any cleverness you know inside. Oh father we have no capacity to believe this word. No capacity to see these things. &gt;&gt; Must be you on the inside Lord receiving this word. And I just want to appreciate you and thank you for that Lord. Bless your children once again, Father, and continue to reveal yourself to to them, oh God, and unfold these things. And because one of these days is the power of this word that will be that chariot of Elijah that takes us out of here. It will be that step, next step that we take into our theophies and will be taken and raptured out of here. We thank you father that we can see ourselves as represented in that rapture as we pray these blessings and this gratitude that we have towards you father in the name of the lord Jesus Christ the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Amen. Beautiful. I love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you appreciate the word of the Lord? Let's give the Lord another good praise. [applause] Amen.

Because we have the same tutor. &gt;&gt; The guide who is leading us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So many of those things, the brother came right in the channel of inspiration. &gt;&gt; That's right. and just spoke and you know the angel of the Lord is here speaking. &gt;&gt; Amen.
