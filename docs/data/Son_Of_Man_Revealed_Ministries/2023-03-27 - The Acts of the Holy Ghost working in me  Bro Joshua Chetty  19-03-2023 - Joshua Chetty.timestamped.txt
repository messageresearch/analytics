[9:33] we need the grace of God yes more now
[9:36] amen
[9:37] as we can see gross Darkness upon the
[9:39] Earth
[9:39] men that are failing for fear there's no
[9:43] prospects of any good life on the Earth
[9:45] right amen
[9:47] for this world has now come according to
[9:50] what the scripture says regarding
[9:51] nothing untoward is nothing that is
[9:54] unusual to us because it's something
[9:56] that was spoken of of the condition of
[9:58] the world and the condition of man
[10:00] but we assign God that he's delivered us
[10:02] from the spirit of the age
[10:04] and he's given us Providence amen
[10:07] he's given us all the things that we
[10:09] need to sustain us to keep us while we
[10:11] are here
[10:12] along this journey whatever things that
[10:15] we have need of is already provided for
[10:17] it amen maybe if it's a material need if
[10:22] it finances whatever he has we already
[10:24] have those things taken care of if it's
[10:27] healing those things are taken care of
[10:29] if it's delivered is taken care of Amen
[10:32] and in the word we have it in abundance
[10:34] the word is made plain unto us
[10:37] that's all under this third pool under
[10:39] the opening of the word the word has
[10:41] become plain to us
[10:43] and under the third call it's a mature
[10:46] church that you don't cry you speak the
[10:48] word yes amen
[10:50] and I know this third pool is also going
[10:52] to be those that are holy be holy still
[10:54] those that are filthy be fully Disturbed
[10:57] you're going to also be preaching to the
[10:58] souls that are lost in prison but your
[11:01] job is to continue to preach the gospel
[11:03] in power and demonstration
[11:06] and if not everybody might be called to
[11:09] preach but be it just too many let your
[11:12] life be a testimony and let the things
[11:14] that the good Lord has done for you be
[11:16] known unto others
[11:18] share your joy with him let them be
[11:20] astonished at the things that you are
[11:22] saying let them know that you have been
[11:25] with Jesus amen amen
[11:28] so we've got a Bible this morning we'll
[11:30] turn to the book of Saint John chapter
[11:32] 15 verses 5.
[11:39] like I said the last time
[11:42] if the presence of God is in something
[11:44] there must be a continuity
[11:46] there must be a consistency and there
[11:49] must be a progression
[11:50] the Church of God doesn't remain
[11:52] stagnant
[11:54] amen the Church of God don't receive
[11:56] something today they're excited about it
[11:58] they're rejoicing in next few days
[12:00] they're back to the Econo later
[12:03] amen if you've got the Holy Ghost there
[12:06] must be a consistent walk
[12:08] amen
[12:11] you've got your Bible listen to the
[12:12] people say in John chapter 15 verse 5.
[12:20] I am the Vine
[12:22] Yea are the branches
[12:25] he that abideth in me
[12:28] and I in him
[12:32] personal pronoun amen
[12:34] the same bringeth forth much fruit
[12:39] amen for without me yeah you can't do
[12:43] nothing
[12:45] so what is Jesus saying
[12:47] I have to abide in you
[12:50] and unless I abide in you you can't
[12:52] produce nothing
[12:55] but if you want to produce what divine
[12:58] produced
[13:00] then he must abide in you
[13:02] and you are the branches spreading foot
[13:04] from the Vine
[13:06] then the very life
[13:08] from the vine the very nature of the
[13:11] vine the very Spirit of the vine must
[13:13] abide in you and it will produce the
[13:16] same fruits amen
[13:19] amen we also turn to the book of Acts
[13:24] let's read from x three one
[13:32] this one I will
[13:35] thank you
[13:38] now Peter and John went up together into
[13:41] the temple at The Hour of Prayer
[13:44] being the ninth hour and a certain man
[13:46] lame from his mother whom was carried
[13:52] whom they laid daily at the Gate of the
[13:55] temple which is called Beautiful
[13:58] to ask arms of them that entered into
[14:01] the temple
[14:03] was seeing Peter and John about to go
[14:06] into the temple asked an um
[14:10] and Peter fastening his eyes upon him
[14:13] with John
[14:15] said look on us
[14:19] she's not saying look at the scriptures
[14:22] look at what is prophesied
[14:24] look at the promise for the day he said
[14:27] look on us
[14:32] now these are the apostles that received
[14:36] the Holy Ghost
[14:38] after now this is after an upper room
[14:40] experience
[14:41] and the Holy Ghost is in them
[14:43] [Music]
[14:45] now
[14:46] they are saying to this man look on us
[14:50] we're not pointing into scripture
[14:51] they're not pointing into prophecy
[14:53] they're talking about present now while
[14:56] he's standing there they say look on us
[14:59] they're showing him they're going to
[15:01] demonstrate how scripture is being
[15:02] materialized through them
[15:06] so they say
[15:08] and he gave Eid unto them expecting to
[15:12] receive something of them
[15:14] then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I
[15:18] None
[15:19] but such as I have
[15:22] now they he was looking for something
[15:25] from the natural
[15:26] something that he could see materially
[15:28] right
[15:30] but now something that he could not see
[15:33] in them because he's looking at the Khan
[15:35] is looking at the flesh he's looking at
[15:37] Peter and joining the flesh
[15:39] but the person that was talking to him
[15:42] wasn't from the flesh it was from within
[15:45] Peter amen amen when he said look on us
[15:47] what was that talking today to his other
[15:50] man it was the Holy Ghost through Peter
[15:52] amen
[15:53] [Music]
[15:54] and there was one was talking to this
[15:57] man
[15:58] and he said
[16:00] then Peter said silver and gold are by
[16:03] none but such as I have I give i z in
[16:06] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[16:10] rise up and walk
[16:13] what was that now
[16:15] the same Jesus that died that rose again
[16:18] he's here again amen amen there must be
[16:22] a continuity but now he's working
[16:25] through a people who have become the
[16:28] branches
[16:29] amen
[16:31] he said rise up and walked and he took
[16:34] him by the right hand and lifted him up
[16:36] and immediately Street an ankle bones
[16:38] receive strength
[16:40] and he leaping up stood and walked and
[16:43] entered with them into the temple
[16:45] walking and leaping and praising God and
[16:48] all the people saw him walking and
[16:50] praising God yeah a miracle took place
[16:52] amen
[17:01] it also turned to the book of Acts
[17:02] chapter 4 verse 13.
[17:12] verse 13. now when they saw the bonus
[17:16] of Peter and John
[17:20] look at look at how it emphasized yet
[17:22] the boldness
[17:24] because the same Peter and John had
[17:26] Saint Peter had fear
[17:29] when they asked him if he was acquainted
[17:31] with Jesus and he denied him Thrice this
[17:34] is before the Holy Ghost but after
[17:36] receiving the Holy Ghost
[17:39] they saw the boldness
[17:42] of Peter and John
[17:44] and perceive that they were unlearned
[17:48] and ignorant men
[17:51] they marveled and they took knowledge of
[17:54] them that they had been with Jesus so in
[17:57] other words they noticed them
[18:00] they noticed that
[18:02] these people we knew them
[18:04] we knew them from this area they were
[18:06] unlearned men
[18:09] but look at the bonus they have look at
[18:11] the knowledge they have
[18:13] then they had this now
[18:16] he's showing a characteristic that they
[18:18] had been with Jesus
[18:21] and beholding the man which was healed
[18:24] standing with them they could not say
[18:26] nothing against it so first they took
[18:28] notice of them that they was boneless
[18:30] that it wasn't changing them amen there
[18:33] was a bonus upon them
[18:36] then they also took notice that the
[18:38] things that they are saying is not
[18:40] normal wisdom
[18:42] amen
[18:45] they were Marvel at the things they were
[18:46] saying because they know that they were
[18:48] unleaded men they know they knew that
[18:50] these men couldn't just speak of these
[18:52] things on their own yeah
[18:56] so they acknowledge that we were born
[18:58] and they were astonished at the things
[19:00] that they were saying
[19:02] and then
[19:04] there was a demonstration
[19:07] of the day was with Jesus amen by this
[19:10] miracle that took place
[19:14] and now nothing could be said about that
[19:17] because now it was Vindicated amen
[19:20] so they very the things that they
[19:22] professing
[19:23] they boneless and the way they're
[19:25] speaking is now being Vindicated by this
[19:27] miracle
[19:30] that the power of the Resurrection is
[19:32] upon them yes
[19:35] understand also the book of Acts 4 23-31
[19:40] and being let go they went to their own
[19:43] company
[19:44] in other words they went amongst the
[19:46] Believers now it was amongst the
[19:48] unbelief now they're doing amongst the
[19:51] elected amen
[19:52] to their own company and reported all
[19:56] that the chief priests and Elder that
[19:58] said unto them
[20:00] and when they had heard that
[20:03] they lifted their boy up their voice to
[20:06] God with one Accord and said Lord Thou
[20:10] Art God which has made Heaven and Earth
[20:13] and the Sea and all that in them is who
[20:17] by the mouth of thy servant David I said
[20:20] why did the hidden rage
[20:23] and the people imagine real things
[20:25] the kings of the earth stood up and the
[20:28] rulers were gathered together against
[20:30] the Lord and against his Christ for if
[20:34] it should against thy holy Child Jesus
[20:36] whom thou has anointed both Avid and
[20:40] Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the
[20:42] people of Israel which gathered together
[20:43] for to do whatsoever that hand and thy
[20:48] Council determined before to be done
[20:51] and now Lord behold their threatenings
[20:54] so in other words a squeeze is coming
[20:57] upon them
[20:58] and Grant unto thy servants that will
[21:02] all boneless they may speak Thy Word
[21:08] say thank you they must be boneless when
[21:11] you're speaking of the word amen amen
[21:13] when we go out to speak of what God has
[21:15] done for us there must be a bonus about
[21:17] us
[21:18] we must not be embarrassed we must not
[21:20] be ashamed of what God has done for us
[21:26] amen
[21:33] um
[21:36] that we may speak Thy Word by stretching
[21:39] forth and hand to heal
[21:42] and that science and wonders may be done
[21:45] by the name of thy holy Child Jesus
[21:49] and when they had prayed the place was
[21:53] shaken this is
[21:56] the place was shaken
[21:59] where where they were assembled together
[22:02] and they were all filled with the Holy
[22:05] Ghost
[22:06] and they speak the word of God with
[22:09] boldness amen amen there is a continuity
[22:12] and a refilling all the time of the Holy
[22:16] Ghost
[22:17] amen he's not just a once of experience
[22:20] he might come another time someone else
[22:22] may be needing the Holy Ghost and the
[22:24] Holy Ghost will fall down there may be
[22:25] another lot of people already receive
[22:27] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost will
[22:28] fall down amen
[22:30] he doesn't stop
[22:32] and the multitude of them that believed
[22:35] we have one heart
[22:36] and of one soul
[22:38] amen
[22:40] amen this morning I would like to speak
[22:42] on the acts of the Holy Ghost working in
[22:45] me amen
[22:48] I want you to make it a personal thing
[22:51] this morning
[22:52] the hacks of the Holy Ghost
[22:54] they were in the apostles amen
[22:57] the act of the Holy Ghost was in the
[22:59] prophet
[23:01] now it's the hands of the Holy Ghost
[23:03] working in me amen
[23:05] amen amen
[23:08] the Holy Ghost didn't stop Yes with the
[23:10] apostles
[23:23] the Holy Ghost didn't stop with William
[23:24] Branham

[23:29] continuity amen there must be a people
[23:31] on the Earth where the Holy Ghost will
[23:34] come and indwell in them amen and the
[23:37] Holy Ghost wants to work in them
[23:41] the prophet of God says now the purpose
[23:43] what one what was God's purpose in
[23:46] sending the Holy Spirit
[23:48] it says John 14 beginning at the 14th
[23:51] verse
[23:52] and reading to the chapter for the basis
[23:54] God's purpose we find joy in setting the
[23:56] Holy Spirit was the one purpose that God
[24:00] himself might dwell in his church
[24:02] and continue his plan through the church
[24:07] that God was in Christ's continuing his
[24:11] plans to Christ and out of Christ into
[24:14] the church continuing his work through
[24:17] the church
[24:22] Paul says in one Corinthians 2 4 and my
[24:26] speech and my preaching was not with
[24:29] enticing words of man man's Wisdom but
[24:33] in demonstration of the spirit and Power
[24:39] that your faith should not stand in the
[24:42] wisdom of men but in the power of God

[24:49] happening here now how the Holy Spirit
[24:51] works you can see the results amen there
[24:54] were stages there was processes firstly
[24:57] in your life there is
[24:59] God's way of receiving the holy ghost
[25:01] first there must be repentance
[25:03] [Music]
[25:04] then they must be the true baptism in
[25:07] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:09] and then there's a promise of receiving
[25:11] the holy ghosts
[25:13] but he said Terry ye till you receive
[25:16] the Holy Ghost

[28:59] if you want to be a vessel that the Holy
[29:01] Ghost can use

[31:49] wanting to see
[31:51] the world the church world the people of
[31:53] this world

[31:57] deceived already
[31:58] by the false prophets and false teachers
[32:00] amen they don't have the solution
[32:04] they want to see the same works of Jesus
[32:07] Christ
[32:07] [Music]
[32:08] the things that they call Sunday school
[32:10] lesson
[32:11] that they learned in a Sunday School
[32:14] the things that Jesus was doing in the
[32:16] Bible
[32:18] we should be producing them now amen
[32:22] amen
[32:23] that is why we heard this testimony was
[32:25] giving his testimonies to show that we
[32:28] don't talk about a God in the days gone
[32:31] by
[32:32] we're not just telling you about a God
[32:35] that was working in William Brennan yes
[32:38] amen yes we believe the message of
[32:41] William Brennan because the very God
[32:43] that was in William Branham brought us
[32:46] to believe this message amen amen the
[32:49] very God that was William Brothers he's
[32:52] doing the same work today
[32:56] the very God in William Branham that
[32:59] brought forth Deliverance is bringing
[33:00] Deliverance today that God and William
[33:03] Brenner that are doing the healing is
[33:05] doing the healing today
[33:06] [Music]
[33:08] amen
[33:09] amen
[33:14] he says
[33:16] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[33:18] and forever that's how we show there
[33:21] must be the acts of the Holy Ghost In Me
[33:24] In You amen make it personal don't say
[33:29] oh the acts of the Holy Ghost in that
[33:31] church the accident no make it to
[33:33] yourself amen must be in you because the
[33:36] world will not see Jesus Christ out of
[33:39] you
[33:40] please get this
[33:42] get this in you get this digested within
[33:44] you and this is the reality
[33:47] if you're expecting some some great
[33:50] super duper thing to happen it's not
[33:52] going to happen
[33:53] the world's last opportunity
[33:56] this Gentile age this Gentiles
[33:59] dispensation that is closing now and we
[34:02] are at the end of the end of the Gentile
[34:04] dispensation amen the last opportunity
[34:07] this Gentile dispensation got to see
[34:10] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[34:13] and forever is through you and me amen
[34:17] there's no other age there's no other
[34:19] people getting to produce Jesus Christ
[34:22] apart from us yes because the gospel
[34:25] next goes to the Jews they'll receive
[34:28] the Holy Ghost but it's not for the
[34:30] Gentiles
[34:32] so the last Grace upon the Earth the
[34:36] last opportunity the last chance of a
[34:39] power and demonstration of the Holy
[34:41] Ghost is through you and I am
[34:45] [Music]
[34:46] hallelujah amen
[34:49] so there's a responsibility Upon Us amen
[34:57] um
[34:58] he says
[35:00] that's the Church of the Living God
[35:05] that's the way it is
[35:07] and that's the kind of a witness he has
[35:10] now also the church must teach baptism
[35:13] you must be baptized
[35:16] that was the commission Jesus said here
[35:19] in Mark 16
[35:21] he that believeth and is baptized
[35:23] believe first and then be baptized with
[35:25] the remission of your sin and you shall
[35:27] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[35:33] now we know that the rain falls on just
[35:36] in the unjust
[35:37] there's many out there that claim to
[35:38] have the gifts of the Holy Ghost
[35:41] but they haven't come
[35:43] and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[35:47] for them to receive the gift of the Holy
[35:49] Ghost Peter had the key for the age
[35:52] and on the day of Pentecost he unlocked
[35:54] it the keys to the kingdom he said
[35:56] repent every one of you
[35:58] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[36:00] Jesus Christ amen and they shall receive
[36:02] the gifts of the Holy Ghost
[36:05] when you got the gift of the Holy that
[36:07] you must produce the gifts of the Holy
[36:08] Ghost
[36:10] and if you've got the Holy Ghost working
[36:12] in you you must say
[36:13] if you are a brand from the vine then
[36:17] you must produce the same fruits
[36:19] you must produce the fruits of the
[36:21] spirits
[36:22] because now you're not abiding yourself
[36:25] he said he is abiding in you and he must
[36:27] produce of himself
[36:29] amen you're not producing he said it out
[36:31] of yourself you can produce nothing you
[36:33] but you're producing of him amen and you
[36:36] are abiding in him the vine so what you
[36:38] are producing the Fruit of the Spirit
[36:46] he said
[36:48] and the Holy Ghost was will also come
[36:51] upon will be a teaching of the church
[36:54] for Jesus said in Luke 22 24 49
[36:59] sorry
[37:00] yes and behold I send the promise of my
[37:04] father upon you
[37:07] wait
[37:09] in the city of Jerusalem until you're
[37:12] enjoyed with power from us
[37:16] so there's a time when we come into this
[37:18] message
[37:20] we come and we tarry in the word amen
[37:25] carrying the word we receive of the word
[37:28] and we're waiting I until we receive the
[37:31] power from on I
[37:34] and now when you go out you are
[37:37] effective for service
[37:39] and now the Holy Ghost will produce
[37:41] those X amen
[37:46] that is why if you go to the back to the
[37:48] book of Acts what's the bonus
[37:51] watch the apostolic mannerism
[37:55] what are you talking do you talk like a
[37:57] Believer when you're amongst the
[37:59] unbelievers
[38:01] or do you conduct yourself like them
[38:03] do you speak in the hope that you have
[38:06] when they don't have hope yes because
[38:10] they need Grace
[38:12] they need Jesus Christ to come and
[38:13] rescue them
[38:15] they are like
[38:17] when Jesus went to the Hearted Woman
[38:19] she needed to be saved
[38:21] she doesn't need to be criticized she
[38:25] even needed more condemning amen
[38:27] she needed Grace amen amen this world
[38:31] needs Grace amen
[38:33] the Bible says those that are filled
[38:35] with the Holy Ghost are crying and sang
[38:37] for the abomination of the Lost
[38:41] amen when God told Abraham I'm going to
[38:44] destroy Sodom and tomorrow
[38:47] what happened Grace projected the spirit
[38:50] of Christ Came Upon Abraham and he began
[38:52] to plead he began to intercede for his
[38:55] loved one
[38:57] amen don't be puffed up and say the Lord
[39:00] to another's world is going to be
[39:01] destroyed
[39:03] Oh California is going to sink
[39:06] the third one was and destroy the Earth
[39:09] and you're not insisted in Soul
[39:12] you're not you're not interested in
[39:14] saving people from hell
[39:17] and how are they gonna and when you go
[39:19] to tell them these things when you go to
[39:21] preach the gospel to them
[39:23] if you didn't talk and say you know God
[39:25] said a prophet and this is what he did
[39:27] in William bradham's day 96 1960
[39:30] in 2023 you're telling me about 1960
[39:34] but if I tell them about 1916 and I said
[39:37] by the same God
[39:39] there was there he's here today this is
[39:42] what he did in my life amen this is how
[39:44] he delivered me he took me a condemned
[39:46] person a person that couldn't help
[39:49] himself and he transformed My Life by
[39:51] his transforming power amen amen when he
[39:55] can take the violent Sinner and turn
[39:57] from his life amen thank you that is
[40:00] that man
[40:01] that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[40:04] today and forever
[40:06] I mean what is the greatest Miracle
[40:08] taking someone that was lame there was
[40:10] and out of the wheelchair or is
[40:13] he taking the Violence Center and saving
[40:15] his soul from hell
[40:16] which is a great America amen the God's
[40:20] power of transformation
[40:22] you know a few weeks ago I went in
[40:26] took someone out of prison
[40:28] I went and helped him to come out of
[40:30] prison in the courts
[40:33] and when the person looked at me and I
[40:35] looked at I just felt I felt pretty on
[40:37] the young man
[40:40] and
[40:43] he said to me dead
[40:45] I need help
[40:48] I said
[40:49] now you have paid legal fees for me to
[40:51] take you out of prison but I'm going to
[40:53] help you for free
[40:55] to help your life to help yourself you
[40:58] say please
[41:03] his mom said please come and talk to him
[41:06] that's what the world needs
[41:10] how else
[41:14] to look at a soul amen a soul that might
[41:16] be far gone
[41:19] maybe you helped him come out of prison
[41:21] in the natural but you need to have to
[41:23] come to prison from the bondage of Satan
[41:25] amen the prison of this world the prison
[41:28] that will take them to hell
[41:31] this all need to be delivered amen amen
[41:34] you need to have compassion upon the
[41:36] souls
[41:38] because that's the acts of the Holy
[41:40] Ghost working in me
[41:43] amen each one of us got testimonies
[41:46] and I'm sure we can have a test too many
[41:48] nights because God is doing wondrous
[41:50] things
[41:52] amen
[41:53] but what is that
[41:55] what is those testimonies it's the acts
[41:57] of the Holy Ghost
[41:58] got to recognize the team you've got to
[42:01] recognize it because how do you know his
[42:03] presence is in it yes continuity there's
[42:06] consistency and there's progression
[42:09] the light must be changed the light must
[42:12] be transformed you can't be that baby
[42:14] Christian oh but the pastor never visit
[42:17] me yeah all these brothers never pray
[42:19] never call me when I was sick
[42:22] that is an immature Christian yes
[42:26] that is a denominational style Christian
[42:29] where you say oh the good old priest did
[42:31] this the good old priest prayed for the
[42:33] babies the good old priest visited me
[42:36] no we we are calling Sons and Daughters
[42:39] of God
[42:41] amen and if that only goes he's dwelling
[42:43] in you it will bring boldness upon you
[42:45] amen it will bring a maturity upon you
[42:48] amen you will ever work that is
[42:51] different amen people will recognize
[42:53] maybe one he was in the world and you
[42:55] had this drunk at work
[42:57] you know all the worldly walk all the
[43:00] games don't work you know the pants
[43:02] falling and things land but now when
[43:04] you've got the Holy Ghost there's a holy
[43:06] ghost work
[43:07] amen it's a walk of holiness
[43:11] he said but there must be a power and
[43:14] demonstration
[43:18] you must every word that you speak must
[43:21] be better
[43:23] yes if you go to a person
[43:25] at your workplace and they come to you
[43:29] under the anointing you deserve they
[43:30] have a problem
[43:31] tell me you haven't experienced that
[43:34] you you just discern because you tell
[43:36] them you start to speak to them but how
[43:38] do you know these things not you it's
[43:39] the Holy Ghost amen there must be a
[43:41] vindication
[43:43] they must know that God was with you
[43:45] amen
[43:47] they come to you at that time and you
[43:50] don't just pray you don't just suddenly
[43:51] pray for somebody you have to be led to
[43:54] pray for somebody amen so suddenly you
[43:56] decide to pray something makes you pray
[43:57] for somebody
[43:59] the way of indication of that because
[44:01] you know it wasn't you
[44:02] amen now that's the acts of the Holy
[44:05] Ghost
[44:07] if Christ would not let a bunch of men
[44:11] who had worked with him for three and a
[44:15] half years
[44:16] go preach any gospel or could not preach
[44:22] any gospel until they waited for the
[44:25] Holy Ghost
[44:27] the church today has to do the same
[44:30] thing wait for the holy ghosts
[44:34] uh let me put this to you in plain
[44:36] layman's terms
[44:39] if I send my son
[44:43] to the police force
[44:45] my son has to undergo training
[44:48] I cannot my son cannot come on his
[44:51] weekend pass and now act like a
[44:53] policeman and want to go use his foolish
[44:56] power
[44:57] he is not qualified as yet
[44:59] he's not certified at the police officer
[45:01] as yet
[45:02] he does not have the authority as his
[45:06] but when you come out of the tutoring
[45:09] when you come under the training ground
[45:12] and then he enjoys you with power for
[45:15] service and then you have the authority
[45:18] then you have the whole house of Heaven
[45:21] behind you amen then you can go and
[45:24] enforce the authority behind you amen
[45:27] because now he's gonna back you up amen
[45:30] amen every word that you're gonna speak
[45:32] he's gonna back up his words because
[45:34] you're not speaking of yourself you are
[45:36] speaking his word and if you are
[45:38] speaking his word he is obligated to
[45:40] back up his words amen that's why the
[45:43] prophet said take God at his word but he
[45:46] said they also be certain of God Amen
[45:51] so he says wait for the Holy Ghost then
[45:55] you've got the authority don't be like
[45:57] that man in the days of Paul when he
[45:59] wants to come now and he too want to go
[46:01] cast out the demons without the
[46:03] authority what happened to him he got a
[46:05] bad thing
[46:07] I experienced this
[46:09] I experienced this one night
[46:13] he was working night shift
[46:15] and we were called out there was this
[46:17] person that escaped from the mentally
[46:19] from the mental what
[46:21] at the hospital
[46:23] and he was a rugby player
[46:25] and he came in Durban boys College
[46:28] so when we arrived there he went up way
[46:31] up on the second floor or something left
[46:33] on the balcony
[46:35] on the ledge of the balcony there was a
[46:37] ladder
[46:39] and he was there performing
[46:42] as well bring up he said when I see
[46:45] police I kill
[46:47] that's that's the word that he said so
[46:49] all went up
[46:51] and there was a wall behind him
[46:55] as soon as I went up there I designed
[46:58] this is a demon Spirit we're dealing
[46:59] with
[47:01] I said in the name of Jesus Christ all
[47:03] your peace and he went like this
[47:08] I told a lot of people around me I said
[47:09] this is the spirit
[47:12] anyway those guys didn't want to listen
[47:13] they thought they got a lot of power
[47:15] because they
[47:17] there's a few of them
[47:18] and he was alone
[47:20] they underestimated the power of
[47:22] demons
[47:25] so one guy went behind him to talk to
[47:28] him to hold him from the from his neck
[47:30] and tried to pull him down into this you
[47:32] know in the you get a corridor in the
[47:34] stickies
[47:36] they tried to put him down
[47:37] this guy
[47:39] beat every one of them up badly
[47:43] they didn't listen to me now now when
[47:46] you are unbelief around you it's hard to
[47:47] cast for the spirit
[47:49] so what I did I used wisdom I started to
[47:51] buying that spirit
[47:52] I started to find him in the name of
[47:54] Jesus
[47:55] recording the book of Psalms I said see
[47:58] I'm telling you all this which normal
[47:59] person who just called the Bible there
[48:01] verbatim
[48:03] that's a demon the devil knows the Bible
[48:06] I find him abundantly sedated himself
[48:11] so it was a lesson learned you got to
[48:14] have the authority
[48:15] behind you to back up what you are
[48:18] saying
[48:19] do not come and say something without
[48:21] Authority amen
[48:24] that is why if I go and pray for a
[48:26] different case I won't just take anybody
[48:28] and I've experienced that in the past
[48:30] you get someone that's straight up
[48:33] that someone got his life right that
[48:35] demon will identify he'll tell you but
[48:37] see this is your problem he tells your
[48:39] form the devil will actually criticize
[48:40] you
[48:41] the deeper will tell you what sin you
[48:43] got
[48:48] he says what will it be
[48:51] the sign of the Resurrection
[48:54] the sign of the Resurrection will be
[48:56] done in a wicked and adulterous
[48:58] generation where are we now a sign
[49:01] seeking generation but you know why it
[49:04] is seeking science
[49:05] because they they tie in this they all
[49:08] rehear in their churches all they heard
[49:10] about a god of History
[49:13] they never saw any power demonstration
[49:16] so
[49:17] the only thing they could do now
[49:20] is
[49:22] seek out the sign they want to see this
[49:23] God they want to see this God so they
[49:26] produce science
[49:28] now a lot of lot of impersonations or
[49:31] the property from that time yes
[49:34] in in the latest case
[49:37] that there was all over the media case
[49:40] when I was when I was speaking to the
[49:42] intelligence service in the police
[49:44] they was telling me that what happened
[49:46] today in those meetings as the people
[49:48] arrived
[49:49] they use artificial intelligence
[49:52] they got your screen they screen your
[49:55] number plates whatever get your license
[49:56] and all that and they get everything
[49:58] about your life
[50:02] and then you
[50:03] come to the person he has told and so
[50:05] your name is social because they got a
[50:07] bio artificial your vehicle already came
[50:09] there and you'll sell them in the name
[50:11] tell them where they come from tell them
[50:13] all these things
[50:15] you see impersonations
[50:17] because there has been the real thing
[50:19] amen
[50:20] and they can't produce debts
[50:23] but they there are sons of God
[50:26] must do the same things
[50:29] there must be a discernment in the
[50:31] church again amen if we claim that there
[50:34] must be another book of Acts then there
[50:35] must be discernment where there'll be
[50:37] the time of ananias Safara
[50:41] in the church again discernment must be
[50:44] in the church to discern the hearts
[50:46] desert descending the church
[50:48] [Music]
[50:49] because what was stopping Joshua from
[50:52] winning the battle he was winning all
[50:54] the battles he had the angel of God
[50:56] before him
[50:57] he had the heart going before him
[51:00] but what caused it there was sin in the
[51:03] camera
[51:04] there must be Discerning to there must
[51:06] be discernment to take to call out sin
[51:10] if you want the only goes to work he
[51:12] cannot he's not a filthy spirit
[51:14] he is the Holy Spirit
[51:18] amen our bodies got to be consecrated
[51:21] the Temple of the Living God
[51:23] and he's got to come and feed upon the
[51:25] word word upon word we take the Bible
[51:28] line upon line precept upon precepts
[51:33] amen I've been moving from Glory unto
[51:36] glory and the Very word that we're
[51:38] eating the very word that we're
[51:40] digesting amen oh the Holy Ghost will
[51:43] now comfort and manifest itself
[51:47] just like
[51:49] if somebody is doesn't have anything he
[51:52] was emptied out
[51:53] 75 clean and then it doesn't allow the
[51:56] Holy Spirit to come in here because he
[51:58] doesn't have the word the right word
[52:01] then this demon powers come upon him and
[52:05] then the more you feed that demon Spirit
[52:07] maybe it's a spirit of drinking alcohol
[52:10] the word that he has to feed that spirit
[52:13] taking alcohol all the time that's why
[52:15] you find these people when they're
[52:16] taking the trance what are they doing
[52:17] they're feeding the spirit they're
[52:20] smoking is all what they're doing
[52:21] they're smoking the dissolved they call
[52:23] it it's all right
[52:24] some people call it kanja marijuana or
[52:26] whatever your colleagues
[52:28] we call it cannabis in the legal terms
[52:30] right
[52:32] they they smoke that's all
[52:34] and
[52:36] they have a drink and they're performing
[52:39] those X
[52:41] because they're feeding their spirits
[52:43] the demon spirit in them they're feeding
[52:46] their spirits
[52:47] so you find a person now
[52:49] if you've got a spirit in him
[52:52] how does he manifest to become that
[52:53] alcoholic if you go to the dream of
[52:56] alcohol
[52:56] 13 minutes feeding their spirits and
[52:59] then their Spirits are manifesting make
[53:01] him go crazy can't control himself
[53:04] it starts to manifest itself
[53:09] and just like that if you got claimed
[53:10] you have the Holy Spirit then you need
[53:12] to feed the Holy Spirit of the word word
[53:14] upon word upon word and then in the
[53:16] right time he starts to manifest himself
[53:18] now you come to vindicate his word you
[53:21] call out his word in the name of Jesus
[53:23] Christ rise up and walk you must
[53:25] vindicate that word
[53:30] in the name of Jesus Christ
[53:32] I'm having this financial problem I
[53:34] speak Lord that you'll open up your
[53:35] windows of Heaven pour out your
[53:37] blessings upon me
[53:40] amen I'm not talking about
[53:43] I'm not quoting you I'm telling you
[53:45] about reality
[53:46] I'm telling you about us seeing this
[53:48] Jesus amen coming and
[53:51] manifesting his word
[53:53] in every circumstance
[53:55] in every situation
[53:58] you might be sitting here today and
[53:59] saying but my circumstances are
[54:01] far-fetched no one will understand my
[54:03] problem
[54:05] that's because you and you want to
[54:07] handle your problem yeah
[54:09] you want to contain your problem within
[54:11] yourself
[54:13] you think your problem is too big for
[54:15] God then you understand it in God
[54:17] you think your problem is so big
[54:21] so what you say about God dear
[54:23] are you are you saying this God is he's
[54:26] so little to your problem
[54:27] he said lay your problem that is him he
[54:30] said my burdens are left lay a problem
[54:33] in my feet
[54:34] take it and lay at the feet of Jesus and
[54:36] leave it there
[54:38] leave it
[54:39] amen let him come and work it amen he
[54:42] work on both ends
[54:46] you love him this morning amen amen
[54:49] amen so he says
[54:52] a wicked in a dancer's generation was
[54:54] done in the book of Acts Jesus raised
[54:56] from the dead came into Peter came into
[54:59] James came into John and the apostles
[55:01] and they did this book of Acts
[55:04] it wasn't the Acts of the Apostles it
[55:07] was the acts of the Holy Ghost working
[55:09] in the apostle
[55:11] amen that we sing We are preaching a
[55:14] message oh the supernatural things
[55:16] happening our day the supernatural
[55:18] happened in the days of William Branham
[55:21] then that same resurrection power
[55:23] must come now upon me must come upon you
[55:27] then it must be the acts of the Holy
[55:30] Ghost again
[55:33] working in US
[55:35] amen
[55:39] it's not a man today it's the Holy Ghost
[55:43] working through a man
[55:46] or men see that does you see he's not
[55:49] talking about the individual
[55:52] it must come through
[55:54] this bride this body we claim to be the
[55:57] body of Christ amen
[55:59] Amen in other words we claim to be
[56:01] working upon the Earth for Christ
[56:04] we claim to be the one that's here now
[56:07] a working body
[56:09] and it better be a working body because
[56:11] when Christ was on the earth he wasn't
[56:13] working
[56:14] he was working amen Christ was laboring
[56:17] yes yes Christ was not still
[56:19] when his ministry started until until
[56:23] the crucifixion and resurrection and
[56:24] Ascension he was working yes day and
[56:28] night he toils
[56:29] he labored
[56:32] amen he sacrificed
[56:35] In The Same Spirit of Christ is yeah
[56:37] amen comes upon the prophet he does the
[56:39] same thing the prophet was working the
[56:43] prophet of laboring
[56:45] the problem is toiling
[56:47] and now we come and receive the same
[56:48] word it must produce the same thing amen
[56:53] amen until the consummation until we
[56:55] have because we are waiting for that
[56:57] body chain
[57:04] he says
[57:09] the Holy Ghost working through a man
[57:11] that does the work
[57:14] he said the man just a vessel
[57:17] but the Holy Ghost is the oil
[57:20] too
[57:24] and look what they did look at the signs
[57:28] that they've done of Jesus
[57:30] they are to take notice of them you see
[57:34] are people taking notice of us
[57:37] when they did this miracle after the man
[57:40] of heal they sent Israel took notice
[57:42] that his men had been with Jesus
[57:45] because why the same signs yes
[57:50] we are saying Jesus Christ the same
[57:52] yesterday today and forever must produce
[57:55] the same signs
[57:57] that's why the prophet when he was
[57:59] Russia
[58:00] and he saw the miracle of the boy being
[58:02] raised from the dead he says he said the
[58:05] communist country this is the god that
[58:07] they'll believe
[58:08] when they see the resurrection power
[58:11] amen this world right now they don't
[58:14] have hope yes
[58:16] don't go tell them to you don't go speak
[58:18] theology to them
[58:20] they are means
[58:23] they have circumstances go and speak to
[58:25] the needs
[58:27] God broke his tied to the needs
[58:29] when layers of the sick let them recover
[58:31] and then they will start to believe you
[58:34] then they'll see it as God
[58:36] and then you can now go tell them come
[58:39] because what do we do to be the same
[58:41] depends every one of you
[58:43] be baptized
[58:45] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:47] he didn't say must of baptism in any
[58:49] power
[58:50] until the confirmation until he comes
[58:52] again
[58:54] we must be baptizing
[58:56] we must be speaking bringing people to
[58:58] repentance
[58:59] people must be convicted
[59:02] they must have a fear of God
[59:05] you know what America takes place the
[59:07] first thing to do the people recognize
[59:08] that God did that and then suddenly now
[59:11] they'll start a fear of God comes upon
[59:13] them that's what happened
[59:16] when the people saw the Miracles they
[59:18] began to have a fear of God upon them
[59:20] maybe there was unbelievers maybe he was
[59:23] living their own lives but now they
[59:25] recognize no that God is amongst us amen
[59:28] we're going to be cautious how we've
[59:29] said we've got to be cautious of the
[59:32] things we say we've got to be cautious
[59:33] how we're moving
[59:35] and if we sing God amongst us right now
[59:37] God is amongst us
[59:40] and we should be have that fear of God
[59:42] upon her we should have holy living holy
[59:45] consecrated lives amen
[59:57] and look what they did the signs that
[59:59] Jesus they did the sign sorry I look at
[1:00:02] the signs that they've done of Jesus
[1:00:04] they had to take noses of them because
[1:00:06] they were ignorant they were unlearning
[1:00:08] Peter and John or they had to take
[1:00:10] notice to them
[1:00:11] they had been with Jesus they done the
[1:00:13] thing that he did
[1:00:16] so you see
[1:00:17] every the four books the four gospels
[1:00:20] God the Pentecostal blessing with every
[1:00:22] scripture to back up exactly what they
[1:00:25] said and now the Acts of the Apostles
[1:00:28] when they came today with the Full
[1:00:29] Gospel that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:00:31] yesterday today and forever so we know
[1:00:33] that
[1:00:34] the book of Acts the the gospels that
[1:00:37] God
[1:00:38] it is guarded until you have the right
[1:00:40] way to come to the key to the kingdom
[1:00:43] but through repentance
[1:00:45] true baptism and then you receive the
[1:00:47] gift of the Holy Ghost and then
[1:00:50] that gospels now become open becomes in
[1:00:53] plain view it becomes Vindicated because
[1:00:56] the signs that Jesus did must be done
[1:01:00] now amen when the when the when the
[1:01:02] gospel is no longer guarded now
[1:01:05] amen and you come the right way to True
[1:01:07] repentance true baptism and come to the
[1:01:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost then what
[1:01:13] happened that same Jesus Christ comes on
[1:01:15] the scene again
[1:01:16] amen he's no longer now
[1:01:19] yesterday is it today
[1:01:22] and forever amen
[1:01:25] because why when Peter started to unlock
[1:01:27] deaths and after the upper home
[1:01:30] experience
[1:01:31] what happened
[1:01:33] Jesus the gospels are unlocked now
[1:01:36] he's walking through the book of Acts
[1:01:39] amen
[1:01:42] you see the secrets
[1:01:44] the prophet of walking in them amen
[1:01:50] and look what they
[1:01:56] now see what he says here
[1:01:58] now Pentecost
[1:02:00] after Pentecost wrote a book of what he
[1:02:03] said acts of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:05] he's at rights
[1:02:07] he's talking about after that experience
[1:02:09] in the upper room
[1:02:10] so after your experience
[1:02:14] after your experience of receiving the
[1:02:16] Holy Ghost
[1:02:18] what are you writing are you becoming
[1:02:19] living
[1:02:21] are we writing another book of Acts upon
[1:02:24] the others
[1:02:26] or we are just continuing the gospel for
[1:02:28] ourselves
[1:02:29] are we keeping the gospel within
[1:02:31] ourselves
[1:02:33] this message are we keeping it within
[1:02:35] ourselves or are we going and producing
[1:02:37] the book of Acts he said prophesy again
[1:02:41] before Nation tongue and kings
[1:02:44] and when you prophesying there must be a
[1:02:46] vindication
[1:02:47] in other words you're going to say them
[1:02:49] that Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:02:51] today and forever this Jesus that you
[1:02:54] read about in the Bible it came in our
[1:02:55] day and this is what he's doing now
[1:02:58] there must be a Vindication amen
[1:03:02] God must back up his word
[1:03:04] but you gotta you gotta take his word by
[1:03:06] faith you can't just gonna say okay I
[1:03:09] think the scripture said this decent
[1:03:11] shall follow them that believe in fact
[1:03:13] they shall recover
[1:03:16] okay let's see
[1:03:17] no you gotta believe it
[1:03:21] you gotta have faith to believe it amen
[1:03:25] you gotta believe that he's with you
[1:03:27] I just gotta act upon these words
[1:03:30] you gotta believe that when you speak
[1:03:31] when you speak his word when you take
[1:03:34] that promise that is given unto you in
[1:03:36] his word he must come and act upon his
[1:03:38] word amen you must believe that yes
[1:03:42] that's why he said do not use the word
[1:03:43] of God in vain
[1:03:46] you can't use it in vain you've got to
[1:03:47] use it by faith
[1:03:50] that's why when you come under the
[1:03:52] tradition of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:54] and now your mature son
[1:03:56] and you give thee all the authority now
[1:03:58] now he enjoys your towel from an eye
[1:04:01] now you've got the authority you got the
[1:04:04] backing
[1:04:05] amen so every word you speak God is
[1:04:08] backing
[1:04:10] and if he's backing you up you must come
[1:04:13] and do what he did there
[1:04:23] he says
[1:04:26] what does The X start of with
[1:04:28] the first thing to enter into salvation
[1:04:33] you see Acts 2 38 says repent every one
[1:04:36] of you because the Earth they sing Peter
[1:04:39] they saw Peter and all that they know
[1:04:41] they were fearing before but not they
[1:04:43] thought that boldness in them
[1:04:45] and plus kissing the manifestation
[1:04:47] because
[1:04:49] whatever language that they came from
[1:04:51] and Peter is just speaking one language
[1:04:53] right Peter does not speaking different
[1:04:54] language he is speaking in one language
[1:04:56] but he's projecting in their own
[1:04:58] language amen
[1:05:00] so when you got the Holy Ghost
[1:05:03] and you're talking to that man down the
[1:05:04] street
[1:05:06] whatever you need is
[1:05:08] when you're speaking under the Holy
[1:05:10] Ghost
[1:05:11] he's understanding you
[1:05:13] because he knows that you wouldn't know
[1:05:16] his needs yes you wouldn't know his
[1:05:19] circumstance
[1:05:21] like oh they saw people they wouldn't
[1:05:23] speak that language these men are
[1:05:25] Galilean they wouldn't speak our
[1:05:27] language how can they speak my language
[1:05:29] how can I understand them in my language
[1:05:31] what they are saying
[1:05:33] that man will say but this person
[1:05:36] doesn't know my need
[1:05:39] then they will recognize that God is
[1:05:40] with you
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:44] the first thing he said
[1:05:47] he has the last one around is it right
[1:05:49] there was all full with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:51] and begin to speak with other tongues
[1:05:54] and Peter stood up and preached them a
[1:05:56] sermon
[1:05:57] then they said what can we do
[1:06:00] how we going to get into that
[1:06:04] and he gives them repent he baptized
[1:06:06] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:06:07] Christ
[1:06:08] you said now remember
[1:06:10] God had some gods for that Mercy seats
[1:06:14] what is that Mercy Seat that God
[1:06:18] met you on the East look
[1:06:20] Matthew Mark Luke and John all of their
[1:06:22] four gospels vindicate the book of Acts
[1:06:25] to come they guard it any way you want
[1:06:27] to look at it so you that is why
[1:06:31] to unlock
[1:06:34] what Jesus did the sign that Jesus did
[1:06:37] to unlock that you've got to come
[1:06:40] by Acts 2 38.
[1:06:42] and then it unlocks that
[1:06:44] and then there will be a vindication
[1:06:46] of all the things that Jesus was doing
[1:06:48] while he was on Earth must do it through
[1:06:49] his body
[1:06:52] he said greater things than this shall
[1:06:53] too
[1:06:55] why now it's a many-membered body
[1:06:58] in that day you shall know that the
[1:07:00] father was in me and I in you
[1:07:05] in that day you'll understand now what
[1:07:08] if Nevada is talking about what he meant
[1:07:09] because everything you're doing while he
[1:07:11] was in the flesh body
[1:07:14] it was God working through him amen it
[1:07:17] was the Holy Ghost insecting him Holy
[1:07:20] Ghost giving you wouldn't do something
[1:07:21] to the father showed them until you see
[1:07:24] your vision then you act
[1:07:25] then there you'll understand and now
[1:07:27] he's in you
[1:07:29] and everything that you do you are
[1:07:30] instructed by him
[1:07:32] you understand your whole life as a
[1:07:34] guide
[1:07:35] that's why he said yeah you have a guide
[1:07:37] amen he's here to guide you he's here to
[1:07:41] instruct you he's here to give you
[1:07:42] leadership
[1:07:45] and therefore you'll never need to go to
[1:07:48] a certain place
[1:07:50] to find some people why something will
[1:07:52] stop you say don't go there I want you
[1:07:54] to take this route I want you to visit
[1:07:56] this person I want you to call this
[1:07:58] person
[1:08:00] and you realize
[1:08:02] that when you call the person the person
[1:08:03] has a need
[1:08:04] for sometimes the Lord will bring
[1:08:06] someone to your thought and say pray for
[1:08:07] them yes
[1:08:08] and you realize you've been praying for
[1:08:09] this person by this person at his name
[1:08:11] yes
[1:08:14] the other day
[1:08:16] a call from the commissioner from the
[1:08:19] commissioner's office
[1:08:21] the person
[1:08:22] spoke to me with this saying no I need
[1:08:25] you to go to a certain place because you
[1:08:27] know your minister they're having these
[1:08:29] things I said no no I don't compromise I
[1:08:32] wouldn't go with his other religious
[1:08:33] jokes

[1:08:38] needs the things that they have need of
[1:08:40] and they were just astounded I said I
[1:08:42] said who made your phone
[1:08:44] they couldn't understand
[1:08:46] I just thought of you because it was
[1:08:48] tired is religious and all that who made

[1:09:21] the things that I told you is what's
[1:09:23] needful for you
[1:09:25] yeah so you see what I'm talking about
[1:09:26] we're living in the hour if you've got
[1:09:28] the Holy Ghost you'll have discernment
[1:09:29] that's why someone can be quiet someone
[1:09:32] can just be you'll just know what you're
[1:09:33] thinking about then you just keep quiet

[1:09:37] your colleagues at work and you can see
[1:09:38] the God will show you don't talk to them
[1:09:40] no more
[1:09:41] or say this thing can you give me the
[1:09:43] right word to say
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:48] x three one
[1:09:55] just turn our Bibles in the Book of
[1:09:57] Matthew chapter 13.
[1:09:59] [Music]
[1:10:04] hey man you love the Lord
[1:10:05] [Music]
[1:10:15] Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 1-23 the same
[1:10:19] day when Jesus out of the house
[1:10:21] he sat by the seaside
[1:10:23] and great multitudes were gathered
[1:10:26] together unto him
[1:10:27] so that he went into a ship and said
[1:10:31] and the whole multitude stood on the
[1:10:33] shore and he spoke many things unto them
[1:10:35] in parables saying be holy saw when for
[1:10:38] the soul and when he sowed some seeds
[1:10:41] fell by the wayside
[1:10:43] and the followers came and devoured them
[1:10:45] up
[1:10:46] some fell upon Stony places
[1:10:49] where they had not much Earth and
[1:10:52] with they strung up
[1:10:54] because there are no deepness of Earth
[1:10:57] and when the sun was up they were
[1:10:59] scorched
[1:11:02] and because they had no roots they
[1:11:05] witted away
[1:11:07] and some fell among thorns and the thorn
[1:11:10] sprung up and choked them
[1:11:13] but others fell into good ground and
[1:11:17] brought forth fruits someone under the
[1:11:19] Fallen summoned 64.
[1:11:22] who had yours who had ears to your lady
[1:11:25] mirror the disciples came under him came
[1:11:28] and said unto him why speaker thou unto
[1:11:31] them in Parable see
[1:11:33] for them it's terrible
[1:11:36] and he answered and said unto them
[1:11:38] because it was given unto you
[1:11:40] but to them it was given unto you to
[1:11:43] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:11:44] heaven but to them it is not given yes
[1:11:48] for whosoever had to him shall be given
[1:11:51] and he shall have more abundance
[1:11:55] but whosoever nuts
[1:11:58] from him shall be taken away even that
[1:12:02] he had
[1:12:04] therefore speak I to them in Parable
[1:12:07] because they see and see not
[1:12:10] and you're in the year not neither do
[1:12:13] they understand
[1:12:14] and in there we fulfill the prophecy of
[1:12:16] assayas would say by hearing yes and
[1:12:19] shall not understand and seeing you
[1:12:21] shall see and shall not perceive for
[1:12:24] this people's heart is wet grass and the
[1:12:26] Earth are done of hearing and the years
[1:12:29] they have closed left at any time they
[1:12:32] should see with their eyes
[1:12:34] and
[1:12:36] you should understand with their art and
[1:12:39] should be converted see it wasn't meant
[1:12:42] for them to be converted because
[1:12:44] he works with predestination
[1:12:46] he already thought so that they wouldn't
[1:12:48] believe you amen just be destination God
[1:12:52] forso who will believe him God for so
[1:12:55] who wouldn't believe him
[1:12:57] because he's all knowing god amen
[1:12:59] and I should tell heal him heal them but
[1:13:03] blessed are your eyes for the sea in
[1:13:04] your ears for the year
[1:13:06] perfectly I say unto you that many
[1:13:08] prophets and righteous men have desired
[1:13:09] to see those things which they see and
[1:13:11] have not seen them
[1:13:13] and to hear the things which are here
[1:13:15] and have not heard them
[1:13:17] therefore the parable of the sword
[1:13:20] for when one year the word of the
[1:13:22] Kingdom
[1:13:24] and understanding it not again come with
[1:13:27] the wicked one and catch the way that
[1:13:28] which were thrown in his hearts
[1:13:31] so you see we can be sitting here today
[1:13:34] and you can hear the messages
[1:13:38] and you understand it not in other words
[1:13:40] the holy spirit is not there to show it
[1:13:41] to reveal it to you
[1:13:43] then what he says here because the
[1:13:46] bigger one can't come if you got the
[1:13:47] Holy Ghost right but he says
[1:13:51] if you understand it not
[1:13:54] then the then come up the wicked one and
[1:13:57] catch the way that which was thrown in
[1:13:59] his heart
[1:14:01] so that's e is he which receive and Seed
[1:14:05] by the wayside
[1:14:06] but he that received the seed in Stony
[1:14:08] places the same is he that year at the
[1:14:11] word and the nun with joy receive it
[1:14:14] yet add in no not true in himself but
[1:14:18] Jordan for a while
[1:14:20] for when tribulation or persecution
[1:14:22] arises because of the word
[1:14:25] by and by it is offended
[1:14:30] he also that receive it so you see what
[1:14:33] everyone is on Stony places now
[1:14:36] persecution arises when tribulation
[1:14:38] arises he said oh but Lord I believe
[1:14:40] your word I believe this message but why
[1:14:42] are all the things happening you see
[1:14:44] your carnal thoughts are coming
[1:14:46] then you don't know how to exercise that
[1:14:48] word by faith
[1:14:55] he that he also that receive it seed
[1:14:57] among the Thorns he that Hearth the word
[1:14:59] and the care of this world
[1:15:02] and the deceitfulness of riches choke
[1:15:05] the word
[1:15:06] and he become an unfruitful
[1:15:09] you see
[1:15:11] though he received the word
[1:15:14] but he's got all this
[1:15:16] he's too EarthBound
[1:15:19] he's too engrossed with the things of
[1:15:20] the world
[1:15:21] and all the cares of his life the thing
[1:15:23] that he must do tomorrow with his work
[1:15:25] and his finances and all the things that
[1:15:27] he must do
[1:15:28] he's worried about that
[1:15:31] but not
[1:15:33] worried about his astrology is not God
[1:15:36] you see where his property is now
[1:15:38] if his priority was the things of God
[1:15:41] then everything else will come right
[1:15:43] seek him first
[1:15:45] the kingdom of God
[1:15:47] and is righteousness
[1:15:50] then all these things shall be added
[1:15:54] unto you
[1:15:56] the Bible says delight yourself in the
[1:15:58] Lord
[1:15:59] and he shall Grant you the desires
[1:16:06] but he will choke the word and it
[1:16:07] becomes
[1:16:09] must be for truth amen
[1:16:11] but he that receiveth seed
[1:16:14] into the good ground
[1:16:16] you see that in other words yeah he came
[1:16:19] the right way
[1:16:21] number two repentance
[1:16:23] come by through baptism
[1:16:26] and the ground was right now amen
[1:16:29] because why he left out of himself
[1:16:32] letter of the world Amen emptied himself
[1:16:35] out
[1:16:35] he's ready now to receive of the spirit
[1:16:38] God can only use you the amount you want
[1:16:41] him to use you
[1:16:44] amen he only came to full you up if you
[1:16:46] let out
[1:16:47] if you let out of yourself and allow him
[1:16:49] to fool you he will fill you
[1:16:52] like Pastor Adrian was preaching the
[1:16:54] holy spirit is a gentleman
[1:16:57] he will not come he never the church is
[1:16:59] a female he won't come and force himself
[1:17:01] onto her the devil does that the devil
[1:17:04] goes and ravishes the church world
[1:17:07] but the holy spirit is a gentleman amen
[1:17:10] as much as you would allow him
[1:17:13] that's the amount he will use you
[1:17:16] amen so you say Lord
[1:17:19] take all of me amen

[1:17:26] instruction

[1:17:31] and be like Esther you're going to
[1:17:33] create soil when the king soil
[1:17:35] you could offer even to half of the
[1:17:37] Kingdom
[1:17:37] because the characteristic was right the
[1:17:40] character was right the nature was right
[1:17:43] amen
[1:17:45] and if you will love him with your heart
[1:17:47] but if you've got no time for him
[1:17:49] if you're more interested in your own
[1:17:50] program
[1:17:52] and he's not going to force himself
[1:17:53] don't think the Lord is suddenly just
[1:17:56] going to come and give you all these
[1:17:57] things
[1:17:58] the Lord is just gonna suddenly produce
[1:18:00] the acts of the Holy Ghost through you
[1:18:02] no no it has to be your surrendered life
[1:18:06] your consecrated individual life do not
[1:18:10] rely upon your mother and father do not
[1:18:13] rely upon the Ministers of the church do
[1:18:15] not rely upon the Elders of the church
[1:18:17] do not rely upon the church but it's an
[1:18:20] individual walk it's an individual
[1:18:23] choice that you chose now to be a
[1:18:26] prisoner of Jesus Christ is an
[1:18:28] individual Choice Lord I Surrender my
[1:18:30] thoughts

[1:18:38] of one come and use Me O God

[1:18:48] the good God he's either here at the
[1:18:49] word and understanding it
[1:18:51] and which also beared fruit and bring it
[1:18:54] fought fruit from an unfold and some 60
[1:18:56] and some 30 it must produce fruit must

[1:19:08] spirit amen Joy love long-suffering
[1:19:12] peace all these things Temperance
[1:19:14] godliness amen all these things that
[1:19:16] bring you even to a statue of a perfect
[1:19:18] man you must produce all those things
[1:19:22] you can't have all those things that
[1:19:24] deceive yourself to say no the Holy
[1:19:25] Ghost must work through me now the Holy
[1:19:27] Ghost will produce another book of Acts
[1:19:29] they have to carry there they have to
[1:19:32] wait till the Holy Ghost come upon them
[1:19:35] be there to be converted first
[1:19:38] amen that's what Jesus said I pray that
[1:19:41] you be converted
[1:19:42] there must be a conversion and when you
[1:19:46] have a conversion God transforming power
[1:19:50] transforming your life
[1:19:55] you're waiting now for the Redemption of
[1:19:57] your body but you already turned
[1:20:00] Heavenly amen why are you in the natural
[1:20:02] body
[1:20:03] the already partakers of the divine
[1:20:05] nature amen
[1:20:07] amen what that mean you ought to be
[1:20:08] turned Heavenly while you never receive
[1:20:10] your body change
[1:20:12] you turned Heavenly because the nature
[1:20:14] changed amen your thinking has changed
[1:20:17] amen the thoughts have changed
[1:20:19] you are now seated in Heavenly places in
[1:20:21] Christ Jesus your thinking is no longer
[1:20:24] Earthly your thinking is of the Heavenly
[1:20:26] because your influence is not from
[1:20:28] beneath
[1:20:29] your influence is from above
[1:20:30] [Music]
[1:20:33] he said what we need is not education
[1:20:36] we need the power and demonstration of
[1:20:40] the Holy Ghost back in the church
[1:20:42] to demonstrate the power of Jesus sorry
[1:20:46] to demonstrate the power Jesus never
[1:20:48] said go into all the world and teach he
[1:20:51] never said go into all the world he said
[1:20:54] sorry he said go into all the world and
[1:20:56] preach the gospel and the gospel is to
[1:21:00] us to demonstrate the power of the Holy
[1:21:04] Ghost amen amen the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:07] powerful the Holy Ghost is the active
[1:21:09] force of God Amen
[1:21:12] he wants to demonstrate the power
[1:21:17] what power the power of the Resurrection
[1:21:21] who is still a million mile shot than
[1:21:24] where we should be let us move forward
[1:21:26] let us go back where we left him in the
[1:21:28] Feast of Pentecost so you see God who's
[1:21:31] doing the work from the beginning of
[1:21:32] this here in the church
[1:21:34] because we've come to a realization
[1:21:37] that we're not where we ought to be
[1:21:40] and after we take in that decision
[1:21:43] led by the Holy Spirit and each family
[1:21:45] each individual started to consecrate
[1:21:47] their lives
[1:21:49] we started going to spiritual discipline
[1:21:51] everyone should be prayerful everyone
[1:21:54] should be surrendering themselves amen
[1:21:58] what happened when we started to do that
[1:21:59] now you made the ground rights we
[1:22:03] started to create the right atmosphere
[1:22:05] because the atmosphere must be right for
[1:22:08] the Holy Ghost to come in
[1:22:10] the Holy Ghost can't come in atmosphere
[1:22:12] where someone is on the Wayside
[1:22:15] believer
[1:22:18] amen
[1:22:19] you're either in or you're out
[1:22:22] the Holy Ghost cannot work with a
[1:22:24] lukewarm believer
[1:22:25] the Holy Ghost once they surrendered
[1:22:27] lives he wants a consecrated life
[1:22:30] and if his life is consecrated ask what
[1:22:33] you will and you shall receive
[1:22:35] you say no I've got a family member with
[1:22:37] chicken with cancer

[1:22:54] the world as soon as God all of them and
[1:22:57] then now the spirit of alcohol is upon
[1:22:59] them and nothing can be done no God can
[1:23:02] transform a power on a person overnights

[1:23:07] power
[1:23:09] burnouts
[1:23:10] all the darkness from him burn out all
[1:23:13] the sin from them

[1:23:25] well like that vine put forth the first
[1:23:28] branch and out of that Branch wrote a

[1:23:34] another book of Acts the third branch
[1:23:37] will make another book of Acts and every
[1:23:39] brand that comes out of that vine will
[1:23:42] be the same as the first Branch one man
[1:23:45] amen can somebody say I am that book of
[1:23:48] Acts amen amen can somebody say the the
[1:23:53] acts of the Holy Ghost working in me

[1:24:14] people must see Jesus Christ again yes
[1:24:17] yeah crying out you don't know what to
[1:24:20] do they don't have the answer you have

[1:24:25] Kingdom you have given the opportunity
[1:24:27] to see these things to them it's made
[1:24:29] incredible
[1:24:30] Amen to damn it to you is revealed
[1:24:33] plainly amen so if it's reveal to you
[1:24:38] go and share it
[1:24:41] it's not meant for them but go and
[1:24:43] produce the book of Acts
[1:24:45] because they don't have the answer
[1:24:47] you got the secrets amen
[1:24:49] they don't have
[1:24:51] you have the answers that they don't
[1:24:53] have
[1:24:54] dating the days of Miracle of us
[1:24:57] the days of Bible miracles
[1:24:59] all these things are just Biblical
[1:25:01] history
[1:25:05] he says
[1:25:07] now you can draft
[1:25:10] I've seen a citrus tree with about eight
[1:25:12] different kinds of food on it I've seen
[1:25:14] an orange tree putting for grain fruits
[1:25:16] and lemon and everything else on it but
[1:25:18] they were drafted in that's what the
[1:25:20] matter today we drafted in our own ideas
[1:25:23] drafted in our denomination in a message
[1:25:26] I could say we drafted in message
[1:25:27] theology different time to to hop on
[1:25:30] certain things
[1:25:31] and instead of allowing the Holy Spirit
[1:25:33] to move people denominated around a
[1:25:35] certain Doctrine
[1:25:37] and they closed the people they closed
[1:25:38] the work of the Holy Ghost out they
[1:25:40] wouldn't even want to fellowship with
[1:25:41] other people because they denominated
[1:25:43] around a certain Doctrine only
[1:25:46] but if that tree ever put forth another
[1:25:49] fruit wine itself it will be like the
[1:25:52] original ones that went into it
[1:25:55] oh church WIll blend together but we
[1:25:58] need the power of the original we need
[1:26:01] the Holy Ghost the power of the
[1:26:03] resurrection of Jesus Christ that's what
[1:26:05] he told us
[1:26:11] [Music]
[1:26:15] amen
[1:26:17] he said we don't need a denominator
[1:26:19] denomination we don't need a new church
[1:26:21] balloon what we need today is an old
[1:26:24] time backwards sky blue sin killing
[1:26:27] Pentecostal Revival that was born at
[1:26:31] Pentecost
[1:26:32] I'm not talking about the Pentecostal
[1:26:34] denomination we are the true
[1:26:35] Pentecostals amen amen I'm not talking
[1:26:38] about people call himself Pentecostal
[1:26:40] denomination we are the true Pentecost
[1:26:43] best because it's an experience
[1:26:45] amen
[1:26:46] and he's back into the church again
[1:26:49] the power of the Holy Ghost again to
[1:26:52] bring Jesus under scene

[1:26:59] scene in a crucial moment
[1:27:03] oh sometimes I find yourself in the
[1:27:05] difficulty oh Lord why am I in this
[1:27:07] difficulty
[1:27:09] sometimes the Lord allows this thing to
[1:27:11] happen to demonstrate the power of the
[1:27:13] Gospel sometimes the Lord allowed
[1:27:15] someone to be sick
[1:27:17] so that you can be on the scene to pray
[1:27:18] for them and God will come back his word
[1:27:21] amen
[1:27:28] sometimes it might be a debt in the
[1:27:30] family and you wonder why
[1:27:32] why they have to be this get in the
[1:27:33] family
[1:27:34] but because of the death of the family
[1:27:36] maybe somebody got saved
[1:27:38] maybe someone's away
[1:27:40] I'm living my life fooling around
[1:27:43] I'm living my life Loosely thinking that
[1:27:45] I'm just gonna live and live and carry
[1:27:46] on
[1:27:47] sometimes death makes a person think
[1:27:50] that you can be taken away any time
[1:27:51] you're not dead
[1:27:54] you can also bring your people to
[1:27:55] repentance when you experience someone
[1:27:57] dying then you realize how you can just
[1:28:00] be taken over the scene anytime
[1:28:02] so God has different ways of working in
[1:28:04] different circumstances
[1:28:07] but he says
[1:28:10] the god of History always Rises on the
[1:28:12] scene in a crucial moment
[1:28:14] we need it that's what's the matter with
[1:28:17] our church be we're getting too far back
[1:28:19] we're falling into the Fashions of the
[1:28:21] world and gradually year by year it
[1:28:24] begins to die a little in with their way
[1:28:26] [Music]
[1:28:27] pruning time pretty soon
[1:28:29] God will cut it back as sure as I'm
[1:28:31] standing in this Pulpit God will cut her
[1:28:34] back to make a bare fruits he will cut
[1:28:38] the works of the world out of it one of
[1:28:40] these days
[1:28:42] how many of you can say we are
[1:28:44] experiencing those days
[1:28:46] God is bringing us into that stage of
[1:28:48] bearing fruits God is bringing us to the
[1:28:51] stage yes he's saying it here
[1:28:54] um as Joy I'm standing in his Pulpit God
[1:28:56] will cut her back is the prophet talking
[1:28:58] about
[1:28:59] are we talking about now
[1:29:00] we can see he will cut the works of the
[1:29:03] world out of it one of these days
[1:29:07] amen
[1:29:11] is God not working amongst us
[1:29:15] can we now say
[1:29:17] God will produce a book of Acts or can
[1:29:20] we say God is producing
[1:29:24] currently
[1:29:25] the acts of the Holy Ghost In Me
[1:29:29] God is producing another book of Acts to
[1:29:31] us
[1:29:33] that will do he is
[1:29:37] watch what he says he's going to raise a
[1:29:40] people up
[1:29:42] just as certainly abstaining in his
[1:29:44] purpose he will raise the people for his
[1:29:47] namesake out of the Gentile generation
[1:29:49] he will do it
[1:29:52] there's no other Gentile age left
[1:29:56] we are at the end of the end
[1:29:59] of the Gentile dispensation
[1:30:02] we can't look for another people to come
[1:30:04] to produce this
[1:30:06] this is that there was spoken by William
[1:30:08] Bradham
[1:30:11] it's the Jews time right at air now
[1:30:16] and of the Gentiles are ending out
[1:30:19] but they just went on out he is
[1:30:22] rejecting Christ and rejecting the sign
[1:30:23] they're rejecting everything that's
[1:30:25] called Godly and brand
[1:30:28] it's some kind of telepathy or devil
[1:30:31] power be blaspheming the Holy Ghost
[1:30:34] have we not seen them in this day
[1:30:37] Supernatural Cloud that's the Holy Ghost
[1:30:39] comes down in the home of seven angel
[1:30:42] less swimming
[1:30:44] these are Supernatural things that they
[1:30:46] bless swimming and God will take that
[1:30:49] Minority after a while and raise it up
[1:30:53] into a powerful Church
[1:30:56] and then turn the spirit to the Jews
[1:30:59] and take the Gentile home
[1:31:01] exactly right she's in the making now we
[1:31:04] had an intern
[1:31:07] how many of you can take this and say
[1:31:09] this is that I have heard but now I see
[1:31:14] amen
[1:31:16] because the gospel is good to go back to
[1:31:18] the Jews
[1:31:21] they've got to be the church again
[1:31:24] producing Jesus Christ again
[1:31:26] I'm talking about in your daily I'm not
[1:31:28] talking about
[1:31:29] I'm not talking about something in a
[1:31:31] mass meeting or something I'm talking
[1:31:33] about Beyond close those the death widow
[1:31:36] woman beard close door she had need of
[1:31:38] nothing
[1:31:40] everything that you have made of to
[1:31:42] sustain it to keep her to life was there
[1:31:44] behind closed doors
[1:31:46] when Elijah the prophet came on the
[1:31:48] scene
[1:31:52] daily you'll be experiencing miracles
[1:31:56] maybe you're not flashing enough but you
[1:31:57] know what I'm talking about
[1:32:00] because you are taking God at his word
[1:32:04] you say brother this tough Economic
[1:32:06] Times
[1:32:07] we're living in difficult Economic Times
[1:32:11] and if you read the news he's gonna even
[1:32:13] depress you even further
[1:32:15] they will tell you
[1:32:17] they can't world economies are crashing
[1:32:21] they have no hope
[1:32:23] but
[1:32:24] he says I will never leave you no
[1:32:27] forsake you I will be with you till the
[1:32:29] very end then he said don't take thought
[1:32:32] what food you're gonna eat
[1:32:33] what clothes you're gonna wear
[1:32:36] he said if you
[1:32:38] were a wicked
[1:32:39] can give good gift to your children
[1:32:42] how much your heavenly father is Holy
[1:32:44] good give give good gifts unto him
[1:32:47] provider
[1:32:49] [Music]
[1:32:50] the same one that produced The Realm for
[1:32:52] Abraham
[1:32:54] you know the same one that
[1:32:56] when the prophet spoke this squirreled
[1:32:58] into existence could use that the same
[1:33:00] under Moses when he spoke with frogs and
[1:33:03] those plagues in Egypt he's here today
[1:33:05] amen
[1:33:07] amen
[1:33:09] if you are believing that this same Holy
[1:33:11] Ghost is in you
[1:33:14] but it's not time to cry like a baby
[1:33:16] time to speak
[1:33:18] to exercise your faith by speaking the
[1:33:22] word
[1:33:22] and if you speak the word he will back
[1:33:25] up his words amen
[1:33:27] because he said I will give you even to
[1:33:29] have the kingdom
[1:33:34] power he wants to demonstrate believe me
[1:33:37] God wants to demonstrate the power of
[1:33:40] the Resurrection
[1:33:41] more than you and I
[1:33:43] even think of it
[1:33:44] he wants to show that he's the same
[1:33:46] yesterday today and forever but we don't
[1:33:48] want to take him by his words
[1:33:50] we don't want to exercise our faith and
[1:33:52] speak the word
[1:33:56] the world is wanting to see Christ Jesus
[1:33:58] I am Divine here the brother and the
[1:34:00] branch Bears record of the vine because
[1:34:02] it draws his energy and life from the
[1:34:06] Vine well the first Vine first branch
[1:34:09] that came from this Vine they wrote a
[1:34:11] book of Acts behind the branch we see
[1:34:13] that we see the way the Holy Spirit
[1:34:15] acted in the first church the church of
[1:34:17] Pentecost and then we believe that if
[1:34:20] this original vine ever put forth
[1:34:22] another brand they'll write another book
[1:34:24] behind another book of Acts behind it
[1:34:26] because it's the same life that's in the
[1:34:28] Bible
[1:34:32] amen and that's the quality Jesus won
[1:34:36] that's the quality of what he wants in
[1:34:39] his church
[1:34:40] that we are partakers of the Divine
[1:34:43] producing the same
[1:34:45] from the Bible if you're drawing from
[1:34:46] the Bible
[1:34:47] drawing from the Vine with a branch
[1:34:49] produced that same fruit
[1:34:51] because it's got the life of the vine
[1:34:53] amen the life comes from the Bible
[1:34:57] can't produce another life
[1:34:58] the world you must see Jesus Christ once
[1:35:02] again amen
[1:35:13] he says let me just give you the last
[1:35:15] code no wonder they don't get no way
[1:35:19] but go back to the denomination and make
[1:35:22] a bunch of dressed up polished up people
[1:35:24] intellectual educated never get anywhere
[1:35:27] because that's what they display
[1:35:31] that's all they do
[1:35:32] but Believers take the token
[1:35:35] and what Jesus begin to do in Galilee
[1:35:39] he continues to do now
[1:35:42] through his display of the token of the
[1:35:45] Holy Spirit
[1:35:46] back upon the church
[1:35:48] so it was not the Acts of the Apostles
[1:35:51] it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:35:55] apostles
[1:35:56] and that was a token
[1:35:59] so if the acts of the Holy Ghost In You
[1:36:02] acts of the Holy Ghost in me that is the
[1:36:05] token
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:07] they said they had to take heed to Peter
[1:36:10] and James Peter sorry Peter and John as
[1:36:13] they passed through the gate called
[1:36:14] Beautiful seeing they were ignorant they
[1:36:17] might have said
[1:36:18] because they had the grammar they
[1:36:20] couldn't understand them they might not
[1:36:22] have known the difference
[1:36:24] mathematics of the scripture but they
[1:36:26] had to notice they had been with Jesus
[1:36:30] they could just play their token because
[1:36:32] that same Spirit was upon him before his
[1:36:34] crucifixion was upon them after the
[1:36:37] resurrection
[1:36:39] now they might not believe the message
[1:36:42] they may not believe the things you're
[1:36:44] saying them
[1:36:45] they better not understand it
[1:36:46] but they have to take notice amen
[1:36:50] that Jesus Christ is with you
[1:36:53] they might not believe this Prophets
[1:36:57] but when they see the same works it was
[1:36:59] done in the days of the prophet and the
[1:37:02] same Works being produced the same Jesus
[1:37:04] now is producing The Works through you
[1:37:06] they must take notice of it
[1:37:10] they might not believe this message that
[1:37:12] we are preaching
[1:37:13] but they will say by these people they
[1:37:15] can't produce these things on your own
[1:37:17] Jesus is with them amen now that is the
[1:37:20] acts of the Holy Ghost working in US
[1:37:23] amen they say no I don't understand the
[1:37:25] Supreme seat I can't see it brother
[1:37:29] but brother you know when you pray for
[1:37:30] me the day
[1:37:31] I must tell you
[1:37:33] after you left this is what happened
[1:37:38] this is why in the Bible it is right
[1:37:39] they must take notice what you was which
[1:37:42] that Jesus is with you
[1:37:44] amen
[1:37:45] they must take notice
[1:37:47] this person
[1:37:49] I know their life in the past
[1:37:51] but there's something different about
[1:37:53] them there's a change about them
[1:37:55] the way this person speak
[1:37:57] you know what I I spoke to him years ago
[1:38:00] I met him now again and every time I see
[1:38:02] him this is the same saying the same
[1:38:03] thing they're consistent
[1:38:06] amen there is a consistency about their
[1:38:09] life
[1:38:12] there's people that spoke on a message
[1:38:13] many years ago
[1:38:15] in a family but you know what I must see
[1:38:19] I only can see Jesus through them this
[1:38:21] family member of mine they said they
[1:38:23] have such a humble nature they have a
[1:38:25] nature of Christ only can see Jesus they
[1:38:27] always want to help they always want to
[1:38:29] do something
[1:38:30] there's something lovely about them I
[1:38:32] don't know what it is but it has to be
[1:38:34] Jesus amen
[1:38:36] you see what I'm saying
[1:38:37] they see this consistency in you
[1:38:40] and then
[1:38:42] you go but you know you see this was
[1:38:46] that happening right now in Russia in
[1:38:47] Ukraine
