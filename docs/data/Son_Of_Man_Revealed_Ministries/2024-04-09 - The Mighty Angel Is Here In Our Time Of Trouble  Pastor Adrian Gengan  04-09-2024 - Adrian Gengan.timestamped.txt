[1:01] amen God is our refuge and
[1:04] strength amen I can do all things
[1:06] through Christ who gives me strength
[1:09] amen so God is our refuge and strength a
[1:12] very present help in TR in the time of
[1:15] trouble a very present help in the time
[1:18] of trouble amen so the Lord had
[1:22] blessings to the reading of his word you
[1:24] may be seated I'd like to speak a little
[1:26] thought amen the mighty Angel is here in
[1:27] our time of trouble amen amen amen the
[1:32] mighty Angel is here in our time of
[1:35] trouble and when I say he is here I mean
[1:39] he is here amen amen that's not a guess
[1:43] work I stand here under the authority of
[1:46] the word of God to declare that he is
[1:48] here amen amen hallelujah just as the
[1:51] prophet under his anointing could
[1:53] declare that he is here oh yes amen
[1:56] because the bride can't move without th
[1:59] say the Lord so we got to have him here
[2:02] amen so to say that the Lord is our
[2:04] strength our refuge and our
[2:07] strength that is a powerful
[2:12] declaration in the midst of our time of
[2:14] trouble to be able to remain in a same
[2:18] mind and declare that the Lord is my
[2:20] refuge and my
[2:22] strength most times when we find
[2:24] ourselves in trouble panic panic sets in
[2:29] fear grips the heart amen maybe minor
[2:33] sicknesses come upon us and we don't
[2:36] react that way but let an arct come
[2:40] let's get a cancer
[2:42] report and see if we can remain in a
[2:45] present State of Mind to know that God
[2:48] is
[2:49] here that God is in control of all
[2:52] things so a powerful declaration to be
[2:55] made by sons and daughters of God that
[2:58] God is our refuge amen amen God is our
[3:01] strength am we know that strength is is
[3:05] virtue
[3:06] power amen
[3:09] hallelujah and he's a very present help
[3:12] in the time of trouble but it has to
[3:14] become a living reality not just a
[3:17] scripture memory
[3:18] verse amen do we become overwhelmed by
[3:21] the situations in our lives no matter
[3:24] what we are
[3:25] facing whatever roles we are playing
[3:28] whatever situation we encounter day to
[3:30] day do we become overwhelmed by what we
[3:34] encountering or is there a settled peace
[3:36] in our hearts to know God is in control
[3:39] am God has got this amen I can rest in
[3:44] his unfailing arms knowing you will
[3:46] never let me
[3:47] down amen what do we Panic fear stress
[3:51] have anxiety attacks start throwing
[3:54] Tantrums start
[3:55] screaming yes amen what am I saying
[4:00] handle the
[4:01] situation amen you're a God over your
[4:05] [Music]
[4:06] situation so we see we will see how the
[4:09] Lord's Redemptive names redeemed amen
[4:12] Reveals His unwavering presence and help
[4:14] in our times of need now the word refuge
[4:17] we know is a is a place of safety it's a
[4:20] place of
[4:22] shelter
[4:25] Hallelujah and God is described as being
[4:27] our refuge when we don't know when to
[4:29] turn we need to think of a refuge amen a
[4:32] place that we can go to our hiding place
[4:35] that we can find protection yes amen we
[4:38] can find protection from the
[4:41] danger we we think of the Israelites and
[4:43] The Refuge was in the presence of God
[4:46] when they were escaping the Egyptian
[4:47] chariots and they were navigating
[4:49] through the Wilderness their Refuge was
[4:52] God amen amen and just as God became the
[4:57] Refuge for Israel so you know that the
[4:59] Angel of the Lord went before them and
[5:01] now you went behind them to form a
[5:04] shield between them and the Egyptian
[5:07] Army so he is before us and he's behind
[5:10] us he surrounds us with his
[5:13] presence amen hallelujah so he is our
[5:16] refuge our secure place praise the Lord
[5:20] so when we are feeling overwhelmed by
[5:22] the storms of life whether it be
[5:24] physical emotional spiritual we can find
[5:26] safety and rest in him amen hallelujah
[5:29] now we find in Proverbs 18:10 it says
[5:32] the name of the Lord is a strong
[5:34] tower the righteous run to it and are
[5:38] safe amen and I pray amen we make use of
[5:42] the tower amen I pray amen that that
[5:45] becomes our Fortress a strong tower
[5:51] amen I'm reminded of the story now of
[5:54] the Prophet talking about a storm the
[5:56] storms of life brother Bram took his
[5:59] wife hope and Billy Paul for a little
[6:02] holiday he didn't have much money so he
[6:04] took get into the Wilderness for hunting
[6:06] trip amen perfect
[6:09] holiday and it happened to be storming
[6:12] that day so he left them in a tent and
[6:16] his wife says I'm going to prepare
[6:18] supper don't be long but he goes out
[6:20] into the mountain you know about
[6:22] Hurricane Mountain if you type up
[6:24] Hurricane Mountain you'll probably find
[6:26] a lot of quotes regarding this and the
[6:29] prophet goes into the mountains and a
[6:31] storm comes his way a
[6:34] blizzard that he can't see fog all
[6:38] around he can't find his way back to
[6:42] camp and as is is he's thinking I'm a
[6:46] good an I'm a witsman I'll find my way
[6:50] back until he came to a point he says
[6:54] over him you could hear a voice I'm a
[6:57] very present help in the time of trouble
[7:00] amen but he wasn't paying attention to
[7:03] the voice at first because he was
[7:05] depending upon his own self on what he
[7:08] could do what he could achieve
[7:11] yes sometimes God's going to take that
[7:13] ability away from you or he's going to
[7:16] set the target so high that you can't
[7:17] reach it then you're going to have to
[7:19] depend on him especially in these times
[7:23] especially in these economies amen
[7:25] you're going to have to depend on him
[7:27] amen don't be secure in our own self
[7:29] recognize that God is our source he is
[7:33] our amen so the prophet comes and then
[7:37] he says I just had to surrender to the
[7:39] Lord and I said Lord I'm no good answer
[7:42] I'm no good wisman Lord why don't you
[7:45] come and help
[7:46] me hallelujah amen and the prophet of
[7:49] God says he began to pray and he asked
[7:51] the Lord for his help and he says that
[7:54] as he was marching he realized he says
[7:56] some fog began to clear and he caught
[7:58] sight of Hurricane m
[8:01] amen and all he did was reposition
[8:03] himself he was actually going the wrong
[8:05] way he repositioned himself and he said
[8:08] as long as he had sight of that mountain
[8:10] he just marched straight that way amen
[8:14] so what we saying is keep your eyes
[8:15] fixed on Christ don't focus on the world
[8:18] just keep marching amen and then he says
[8:21] I had my hands raised up because he said
[8:24] there was a telephone wire from the top
[8:25] of the mountain all the way down to camp
[8:27] and he said oh if I could only somehow
[8:30] get the telephone wire I know it would
[8:32] lead me to my
[8:33] destination so he says he was had his
[8:35] hands in his air and he's marching and
[8:37] he's walking and he's trus in the Lord
[8:39] that somehow he'll connect with his wire
[8:42] am with his unseen force with his
[8:45] Heavenly realm amen and then he said all
[8:47] at once he cut a hold of that wire get a
[8:50] hold of the Holy Ghost amen it'll lead
[8:52] you to your
[8:54] destination amen hallelujah if we want
[8:57] to start right in this life we've got to
[8:59] to connect with the Holy Ghost we've got
[9:01] to be filled with the Holy Ghost amen if
[9:04] you don't have food that's okay if you
[9:06] don't have a house that's okay if you
[9:07] don't have a car that's okay but make
[9:09] sure you have the Holy Ghost
[9:12] amen amen it's a must it's a requirement
[9:15] for this life praise the
[9:18] Lord so the prophet found his way back
[9:21] to Camp because he got a hold of the
[9:23] wire and the scripture the lord gave him
[9:25] is I am a present help in the time of
[9:27] trouble amen so we find that he says
[9:31] there I a present help in the time of
[9:33] trouble amen is our refuge and strength
[9:37] so in addition to being Refuge is our
[9:40] strength now strength is referring to
[9:43] power is our power is our source of
[9:46] power amen is our support that enables
[9:49] us to to face life's challenges life's
[9:52] obstacles when we feel weak and unable
[9:54] to handle our struggles God becomes our
[9:57] strength God becomes our former support
[10:00] am amen and it's in our weakness he says
[10:03] his strength become amen his strength is
[10:05] made perfect
[10:10] amen Isaiah 4029 says he gives strength
[10:14] to the
[10:15] weary and increases the power of the
[10:19] weak amen so when we are facing
[10:23] challenges if you could not go on it's
[10:26] in those moments you've got to depend on
[10:28] God's strength
[10:31] I'm going through the basics of the
[10:32] scripture first before we hit the Nugget
[10:34] of
[10:35] this
[10:38] amen so the phrase a present help shows
[10:42] us a God who is there
[10:48] immediately and he doesn't say a present
[10:50] help he says he's a very present help
[10:53] amen our God is very
[10:56] present amen God knows went to respond
[11:00] immediately and went to wait Daniel
[11:03] needed an answer from the
[11:06] Lord but his response his answer was
[11:10] sent
[11:11] Angels but when the three Hebrew boys in
[11:14] the midst of their trial in the midst of
[11:16] their trouble God immediately responded
[11:19] amen yes
[11:21] Lord amen so God's presence is not
[11:25] distant he's an everpresent reality in
[11:28] our Darkness moments when we feel lost
[11:31] when we feel alone he is right there
[11:33] with us ready to intervene ready to
[11:35] assist he is here to help us
[11:38] amen but can we recognize he's
[11:42] here now do we want to get him involved
[11:44] in our school do we want God to be
[11:46] involved in our work do we want God to
[11:49] be involved in our home life we must
[11:52] realize he's ever
[11:54] present amen amen if we're just looking
[11:58] very quickly at the names Redemptive
[12:00] names of Jehovah Jehovah Gyra means he's
[12:02] our provider amen Jehovah Rafa means
[12:05] he's our healer Jehovah ni means he's
[12:08] our Banner Jehovah Shalom he's our peace
[12:12] Jehovah siku our righteousness Jehovah
[12:15] sh is our present he's present this
[12:19] reveals the fullness of his provision
[12:21] and presence now watch every one of
[12:24] those
[12:26] names requires him to be present
[12:30] so sha becomes the Central
[12:32] Point his presence now we know that
[12:36] there's the angel of his
[12:38] presence
[12:42] Hallelujah so these are just not titles
[12:44] just not they are Declarations of his
[12:46] nature and his his his character
[12:50] regarding his promises so when he says
[12:53] is's Jehovah Gyra he's promising to
[12:55] provide when he says he's Jehovah Rafa
[12:58] he's promising to heal
[13:00] but these names assure us of his
[13:02] constant presence sha must be there to
[13:05] provide sha must be there to heal sha
[13:08] must be there amen as our Banner sha
[13:11] must be there as our peace
[13:17] amen praise the
[13:22] Lord so if maybe you're going through a
[13:25] financial difficulty you got Jehovah
[13:28] Gyra amen say Lord you promised you are
[13:31] my
[13:32] provider amen he reminds you of his
[13:35] promises that he's going to meet your
[13:36] need if you're facing heess Jehovah Rafa
[13:40] is here the Lord who heals he assures
[13:42] you of his healing
[13:45] power you know I was reading the prophet
[13:47] and he was telling
[13:52] us about this uh two
[13:55] men Richard
[13:58] Blair if you want to pick up some
[13:59] highlights on this it's in uh 1965
[14:02] trying to do God's service without being
[14:04] his will but I'll just illustrate it or
[14:07] or paraphrase it and you can pick up
[14:09] there amen it's from paragraph 11 so the
[14:12] Brother Richard Blair wrote brother
[14:15] brand him a letter and they were they
[14:18] were dealing with Australia and they
[14:19] were hooking up an electrical wire to it
[14:23] but somehow the trailer with the
[14:24] electrical wire went into the water and
[14:27] there was a little boy swimming in the
[14:28] water
[14:30] water and the boy got electrocuted to
[14:32] [Music]
[14:34] death
[14:36] right it's uh
[14:39] 65078 so it killed a boy and he swelled
[14:43] out like his stomach swelled out he says
[14:45] when they die you know that happens the
[14:46] little eyes set the teeth went together
[14:49] and brother Blair thought I better get
[14:52] old of brother
[14:54] Brandon
[14:55] right he said I better get a hold of
[14:58] brother Brandon
[14:59] now I'm trying to think now in a
[15:01] situation like this imagine you at the
[15:03] scene the person is electrocuted to
[15:06] death what would we do we say he's gone
[15:10] he's finished but look at the brother's
[15:12] present State of
[15:15] Mind can I get to the man of God am amen
[15:19] right but I'm trying to show even more
[15:21] powerful testimony that brother brandham
[15:24] had nothing to do with it okay he just
[15:27] thought of brother brandham but he knew
[15:29] he couldn't get to brother
[15:30] Brandon
[15:32] okay did you get it
[15:36] amen let's read from paragraph 12 then
[15:41] it says it alarmed the Brethren so bad
[15:44] brother BL said he thought he could get
[15:46] a hold of me somewhere to pray for it
[15:48] but remember that it was that his mind
[15:51] went to
[15:52] scripture
[15:54] yes amen wherever two or three are
[15:57] gathered in my name there I am sha amen
[16:00] amen I am a present help yes right and
[16:05] the father skinned his te fingers trying
[16:07] to get his fingers into the boy's mouth
[16:09] to break it open the boy is dead
[16:12] right and they knelled down and started
[16:14] praying over the little boy and he came
[16:17] back to life again
[16:21] amen this is equally as powerful as at's
[16:25] testimony these people brought a dead
[16:27] boy back to life why they remember the
[16:30] scripture they remember the word yes
[16:33] they took the word to the Mind
[16:39] amen so he says what what is that true
[16:42] brother Blair one of our loyal Brothers
[16:43] here the little boy is here see the boy
[16:45] is now in the service the little boy is
[16:48] here he says well thank the Lord that's
[16:50] fine we'd like for you to stand up sunny
[16:52] boy now we thank the dear Lord for
[16:55] this our God is able to do anything he
[16:59] promised it we are living in the divine
[17:01] presence of the great glorious Heavenly
[17:03] Father amen and all things are possible
[17:06] if we can just believe it you see what
[17:09] it does what it paid for that man's life
[17:11] to believe that saved his little
[17:14] boy
[17:16] amen so what am I trying to show you
[17:19] don't panic in the midst of your trouble
[17:21] in the midst of your trial have present
[17:24] State of Mind know that you are son and
[17:25] daughter of
[17:27] godall don't quick to call the
[17:32] Undertaker amen now let's get to some of
[17:35] the message
[17:38] now remember what he's saying he's our
[17:42] refuge and strength in the time of
[17:44] trouble I am saying the mighty Angel is
[17:47] here in our time of trouble amen so what
[17:51] is our time of
[17:53] trouble amen we find here in the message
[17:59] exposition of the seven Church
[18:01] ages brother Bram is reading Revelation
[18:03] 3:11 and he says behold I come
[18:06] quickly that he's talking about the
[18:08] second coming now hold that all that
[18:12] fast to which thou Hast that no man take
[18:14] thy Crown he says we don't need to
[18:16] comment on the thought that he's coming
[18:18] quickly we know that he is because we
[18:21] are in the end of the last days do you
[18:23] believe that amen he says oh fast to
[18:26] what you have that no man take your
[18:27] crown he says it is in the midst of the
[18:30] time of trouble that Jesus comes amen
[18:34] not talking about coming out to your
[18:35] individual needs he's talking about his
[18:37] second coming meaning that there is a
[18:39] time of trouble coming upon the
[18:42] [Music]
[18:45] people when all the foros W is on the
[18:49] Earth all of hell is let loose war
[18:52] council of churches are formed religions
[18:55] are formed political powers are formed
[18:58] demon powers are
[19:00] here a time of
[19:02] trouble he says that's when Jesus comes
[19:06] and when is coming there is a
[19:07] resurrection that's
[19:10] amen many are to come forth Out of the
[19:13] Dust and rise with those who are alive
[19:16] but waiting for his return amen yes
[19:20] don't worry brother
[19:21] Caleb your granny's got to come to this
[19:24] church for the
[19:26] resurrection she's got to be gathered
[19:28] with her people

[19:39] before Hallelujah am in other words all
[19:43] that the p k Locus and caterpillar have
[19:45] eaten I will restore say the Lord
[19:49] amen hallelujah
[19:58] Psalm 27 and verse 5 now watch what he
[20:02] said he just said Jesus comes at the
[20:05] time of trouble brother Brandon picks up
[20:08] this message the scripture in the
[20:10] Rapture
[20:12] message and he takes Psalm
[20:20] 27 he says for in the time of
[20:24] trouble in the time of trouble he shall
[20:27] hide me in his civilian amen is he our
[20:32] refuge so he's going to hide Us in the
[20:35] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[20:38] me he shall set me upon a rock
[20:43] amen amen yes so we are right now in the
[20:46] time of
[20:50] trouble 200 million demons have been let
[20:52] loose upon the
[20:54] Earth he says under melini
[20:58] akman and
[21:02] itler
[21:04] okay he says under
[21:07] there but I
[21:10] declare under this four under this
[21:14] fourth seal it says all of Hell Followed
[21:19] him all of Hell Followed him the rider
[21:23] on the horse go read that meaning hell
[21:27] is emptied out upon the Earth
[21:30] okay my point is now in the time of
[21:32] trouble is going to be our refuge and
[21:34] strength we just showed you brother gram
[21:37] saying in the time of trouble Jesus
[21:38] comes I'm tying it with Psalm
[21:41] 27:5 the the Bible says for in the time
[21:43] of trouble he shall hide me in his
[21:45] Pavilion shall give me a refuge now the
[21:48] Apostle Paul in in Acts
[21:51] 27:23 there if you mark this down we can
[21:55] read from 22 if you want
[21:59] he was in a time of
[22:00] trouble he was about to be Shipwrecked
[22:05] yes
[22:09] amen well maybe we won't go into that
[22:11] now maybe I I'll I'll just talk about it
[22:14] just
[22:15] now let's go to The Sixth Seal while
[22:17] we're talking about this time of
[22:20] trouble we find here brother Bram is
[22:23] typing
[22:25] Jacob in The Sixth Seal and he says we
[22:28] find now that Israel in that time of
[22:29] trouble when he was
[22:33] Jacob he wrestled with the he says he
[22:37] got a hold of something that was real
[22:39] there was a man come down Jacob got his
[22:41] arms around him and he stayed there the
[22:43] fellow said I must be going now it's
[22:45] coming daylight oh the breaking of the
[22:47] day it's fixing to come day but Jacob
[22:50] said I'm not going to leave you I'm
[22:52] going to stay right with you I want
[22:55] things changed here amen
[23:00] right if you want to read the account
[23:02] it's
[23:03] in it's in Genesis 3
[23:06] 32:4 now I noted that it was verse

[27:25] he can't give him something and the goes
[27:28] straight to the root of
[27:30] it meaning he goes to the scene seed he
[27:33] goes to the genetic of
[27:36] it he says and the angel ask him what is
[27:40] your name a name represents your
[27:43] character and your
[27:45] nature what is your jeene
[27:48] seed and he said Jacob he says the name
[27:52] th name shall be called No More
[27:57] Jacob but Israel amen for as a prince H
[28:01] has thou power with God Amen and you
[28:04] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost

[28:25] Amen
[28:28] thou has power with God and with men and
[28:31] H has prevailed Hallelujah if I read
[28:35] Revelation 5 there was one who
[28:37] prevailed it was the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:40] to take the book but on the earth his
[28:43] wife has got to Prevail to be able to
[28:44] take the book Hallelujah as he is so is
[28:48] she if he Prevail so must he she so she
[28:52] prevails to take the
[28:55] book praise the Lord the Lord amen she
[28:59] must Prevail to take the book and he
[29:01] says so he changes his name changes his
[29:04] identity is what I'm trying to tell
[29:06] you that people who thought of you they
[29:08] KN maybe they were Your Best Body in
[29:10] school after you born again after you an
[29:13] adopted son you are not the same person
[29:15] to be identified with amen they can't
[29:18] say hey let's go back and have a good
[29:19] old day what are you talking
[29:22] about amen you don't know me I've had a
[29:25] name change I've had a nature change and
[29:27] he says
[29:28] amen and he prevailed and Jacob asked
[29:30] him and said tell me I pray thee thy
[29:32] name and he said wherefore is it that
[29:34] thou Dost ask after my name and he
[29:37] blessed him
[29:39] there and Jacob called the name of that
[29:41] place pineal for I have seen God face to
[29:44] face and my life is preserved and as he
[29:47] passed over pineal the sun rose upon him
[29:49] and he altered up his thigh therefore
[29:53] the children of Israel eat not the sinu
[29:55] which shrank which is upon the Hallow of
[29:58] the thigh unto this day because he
[30:00] touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in
[30:02] The Sinner that
[30:04] shrank so Jacob walked in new
[30:07] walk I'm saying we are in our new walk
[30:11] now we are in our new walk
[30:15] amen amen it's called an Enoch
[30:18] walk we are in our new walk now why
[30:21] we've been touched by the
[30:23] angel hey I'm not speaking something
[30:25] foreign I'm saying we are physically met
[30:28] the angel and we have been touched by
[30:30] the angel so our walk is different our
[30:33] talk is different so now when we go to
[30:35] meet Esau it's no more Jacob coming to
[30:37] meet Esau it's a new man coming to meet
[30:39] Esau he's a Victor he's an
[30:43] overcomer that even Esau can't be angry
[30:46] with his brother anymore because this is
[30:48] a new
[30:49] man this man has met the angel the angel
[30:52] came in the time of
[30:54] trouble and delivered him oh thank you

[31:27] what
[31:29] a time of trouble such as never was
[31:32] since there was a nation even to that
[31:34] time and at that time thy people shall
[31:37] be delivered everyone that shall be
[31:40] found written in what the book brother
[31:43] Jeff what is that who's got that
[31:46] book
[31:49] hello which means there need to be a
[31:52] transfer of
[31:53] Revelation because as taking the book
[31:55] means we have the Revelation yes sir
[31:57] there needs to be a transfer and
[31:59] impartation from us going off to those
[32:02] next
[32:03] two meaning a transfer from Revelation
[32:06] 10 to Revelation
[32:08] 11 and who's going to provide that
[32:10] transfer the angel
[32:14] himself praise the
[32:17] Lord so you see they without us cannot
[32:20] be made perfect
[32:21] too we've got to leave in order for them
[32:24] to be get their redeemer back that's
[32:26] right they will not see Jesus I'm
[32:27] talking the 144,000 will not see Jesus
[32:30] till we go yes amen so you can see
[32:34] everything is fixed around us six
[32:36] Dimension Saints around us 144,000 Jews
[32:39] around us they're all saying hey guys
[32:42] please go from
[32:44] here and even we grown within
[32:47] ourselves amen longing for the changing
[32:50] of the
[32:51] body so we are the key players now how
[32:54] many of you like to be the key player
[32:56] you hold the Trum card
[33:00] hey you know the trump card is around
[33:03] praise the
[33:04] Lord so he says here this is Bible now
[33:08] right everyone whose name is written in
[33:11] the book we know who has the book right
[33:14] now yes and we are calling the names
[33:16] that are in the book we're not calling
[33:19] the Jewish names we are calling the
[33:20] Gentile names am in our time of
[33:26] Prophecy watch the scripture is very
[33:28] powerful and many of them that sleep in
[33:30] the dust of the Earth shall awake
[33:32] talking about the what the
[33:35] resurrection shall awake some to
[33:37] everlasting life and some to shame and
[33:39] everlasting contempt and they that be
[33:41] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[33:43] the firmament and they that turn to
[33:46] righteousness as stars forever and ever
[33:48] but thou Daniel shut up the words and
[33:51] seal the book but thou bride unseal the
[33:54] book
[33:55] amen Daniel you shut it up it's not for
[33:58] you right unsealed
[34:00] amen unsealed Revelation unsealed
[34:04] Mysteries amen because why he says leave
[34:07] it for the time of the end and are we at
[34:08] the End Amen right many shall run to and
[34:12] from and knowledge shall be increased
[34:22] now I don't want to read what the
[34:24] prophet is saying because I pretty much
[34:25] explained it when I read the scripture
[34:26] amen so we can skip that quote brother
[34:30] amen now the prophet is saying here in
[34:34] in The Sixth Seal you can put it up from
[34:36] maybe verse paragraph 24 278 there right
[34:41] so brother Bram is reading Daniel 12
[34:43] what we just read and now he says now
[34:46] compare that exactly what Jesus said
[34:48] Matthew 24 there shall be a time of
[34:53] trouble has never been since there was a
[34:56] nation right right so he's tying that
[34:59] now with Matthew 24 talking about a time
[35:01] of
[35:03] trouble you see that's written in the
[35:05] Lamb's Book of Life shall be delivered
[35:06] at that time and many of those that
[35:08] slept in the dust of the Earth shall
[35:11] awaken right and if you read Matthew 24
[35:14] it says there shall be Great Tribulation
[35:17] such as was not since the beginning of
[35:18] the world to this time nor ever shall be
[35:22] and except those days be shortened there
[35:25] should be no flesh saved but for the
[35:28] elect sake those days shall be
[35:31] shortened so if you're thinking time is
[35:34] just going on and on God shortening the
[35:39] days in just once more Lord he says this
[35:42] Jezebel system now spiritually now blind
[35:45] spiritually to the word of God joining
[35:48] themselves right into the Council of
[35:50] churches our great in Evangelical
[35:52] teaching we have to Forfeit that to be
[35:54] an organization all organization that
[35:57] isn't n in the Council of churches I got
[35:59] the paper on it that even if your church
[36:02] is not in the Council of churches in the
[36:04] time of
[36:05] trouble they can use your church as a to
[36:08] store ammunition or anything they want
[36:11] and if any man is caught having a prayer
[36:13] for anybody outside of affiliating with
[36:16] this Council of churches can be shot as
[36:19] a federal
[36:22] offense that's right I got the papers on
[36:25] it from Washington they're going to
[36:27] force you into it that's why I've been
[36:30] against this organizational system I had
[36:32] to keep it quiet about it being the mark
[36:34] of the
[36:35] [Music]
[36:37] beast but it's late enough now till you
[36:40] can know it's the
[36:42] truth
