========================================

[Music] Hallelujah you are live and let's lift our hands now and [Music] singana to you are the [Applause] [Music] I hallelujah hallelujah in you I live and move and have my amen let's give the Lord a good an up of Praise hallelujah hallelujah amen amen you may a SE that God bless you amen every saint every believer Amen in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen what a wonderful privilege we have to come again amen there's no other place we desire to be than his presence amen so if we can't gather here in his presence then we want to be with him on the other side amen hallelujah so you know he says David longed to be in the presence of God he says one thing have I desired and that will I seek after that I might dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life now David because he was a king he couldn't physically stay in the temple but now now that the Holy Ghost has come we become the temples and the Holy Ghost can have permanent residency within us now we don't sign a lease with the Holy Spirit and telling you're only allowed 3 months 6 months or 12 month lease we give him full control amen hallelujah to have his way in US amen and I want to remind you that the Holy Ghost has come for a dual purpose to birth you and then to bring you to your adoption now if you read the Bible in Ephesians you were not predestinated to be born again oh yes Ephesians says you were predestinated to be children of God which means to be come to your full adoption so don't be satisfied with just a New Birth come all the way to the adoption ceremony amen hallelujah so amen we have sister narasha visiting with us again God bless you Sister amen and uh I believe a testimony is still growing and we're waiting for the full testim morning I believe sister Ruth was telling me last week she went for another scan and uh was it a sist what do they call it okay a mess so it was 10 cm 10 13 19 and when they last measure it did is five five so something is dying there amen and we rebuke that demon even now yes amen amen hallelujah you know sometimes when you scold a dog you saw how sheepishly it walks away right so maybe it's sheepishly walking away but tonight you've come into the presence of God amen hallelujah hallelujah amen and you shall receive your full healing amen hallelujah so we shouldn't be ashamed of these things you know I have good news for you that today brother Moses was discharged from hospital let's give the Lord a good hande of Praise amen so we we will wait for the full testimony amen because there's so much that have transpired think of it in a week A lot has transpired from the time he was admitted till the time now each one of these brothers have testimonies regarding it and brother Moses himself has testimony about this amen I'll just share something with you very quickly because maybe you won't hear me talk about this again so when I went to the hospital I think it was Sunday so Sunday we had the combined meeting but something urged me to go to the hospital and pray for him so I got that quter to 4 and uh when I saw him looking from a human standpoint death was all over him you'd say there's no way he's going to come out of this bed okay and I believe it was even worst scene the day before that brother Joshua and brother jaff were witnessing because he was black blood just being spewed out you know and he had this eup and he kept like having this jerk and eup so it wasn't very comfortable to see him in that condition but when you're going there under commission you can't look at the symptoms am and even though the family may be around there you got to get the eyes off the situation and to focus on the word amen so read the scripture pray the prayer of faith and we left I left for the service so and this is how Satan works so you got to understand the prophet says when you're about to be healed Satan comes with the worst symptom with a scare tactic next day the hospital tells us that he's got to go onto an oxygen mask now you know when they start to say that they starting to say your lungs are affected your oxygen levels are not optimal and this and that and everything is going down and you know the the initial diagnosis they had was stage four kidney disease that's was from the first blood War amen but we rebuked that thing and we prayed amen amen so when we got the news that the mask was there I said no this is now we need to go even higher spiritually amen amen if Satan wants to raise the bow we need to raise the bow amen amen hallelujah so you get into a time of warfare time of prayer yes and the time of warfare you can't do in the day amen you do Warfare in the night amen amen hallelujah so that required waking up early parts of the night early in hours of the morning and praying and praying and rebuking and canceling out Spirits so Tuesday I said said let me I will I now need to go to the hospital again and I was going to meet brother Joshua there at 2:00 when he went over there something told me take the pillar of fire the prophet with the pillar of fire because brother Moses speaks highly about the pillar of fire and you know he knows about the prophet he'll never say anything negative so I gave him the book healing thoughts and I gave him the pill of fire and I said don't focus on this man focus on the pillar of fire that's the angel of God and he's going to be here with you in this hosp amen you'll hear further testimonies later on about that amen so that was when I went there he still had the oxygen mask but this time I went under the authority because I had fasted we had remember we did Warfare the night before so this time I knew that when two or more agree upon anything it shall be done amen must be done amen so we not learning the Warfare and how it operates for us not to put it into practice so the Lord will present situations for us to know how to handle Warfare to know how to go into Warfare amen so immediately when I started to pray read the scripture again pray over him and then immediately brother Joshua starts to get inspiration and he told him some things there immediately you could see it was all under the anointing that things were being spoken amen amen hallelujah so they were going to do the scope but they never ended up doing the scope that whole week and I know why they didn't do the scope because if they did the scope at that time they would have picked up something and then they would have started to to probe and do this that and the other test so they only did the scope on Monday they did the scope on Monday and they said everything looks good amen right suddenly the blood work now they're not talking there's no kidney problem amen they ran blood test again there's no kidney problem amen amen amen praise the Lord it that thing was reversed wonder the demon was rebuked yes and cast out yes amen that's the power of God amen hallelujah and then you remember what we did here last week wednessday the whole church got together amen and I asked you to put Moses shety name upon your lips amen every one of you have to do it so you're also part of this testimony hallelujah what I'm trying to tell you we took brother Moses from the gates of death amen hallelujah and that's the Power of a Praying church that's the power of God and then you know amen so even the doctors brother Joshua and and probably brother jaff when they sharing the testimony will tell you the doctors are now downplaying everything as if everything is was just normal because you know scientists don't believe in God so they can't testify but we know what happened amen so then you know what happened to Sister Victory they told her she had a heart attack did the ECG and everything the church got to pray now there's no sign of it now they're on a treat of a chest infection amen amen this is not a coincidence amen let's give God praise for that so from saying somebody had a heart attack they're going to book you in for angiogram and we're going to see you know what surgical procedure you need to suddenly now it being nothing blood tests are now clear that's the power of God cuz remember on Sunday I told you they told her that her blood enzymes was way over what it should be suddenly in the latest blood tars everything is normal amen the power of God amen so I want you to remember also Pastor Ruben Daniels uh he was uh amen taken unwell you know we also prayed for him last week wednessday I ask you to remember him in prayer amen so I wouldn't be telling you this if he didn't tell me so today he sent me a message amen and uh so he was telling he's waiting in anticipation for his healing he's waiting for his Miracle amen now there's a testimony behind that which I won't share right now amen but the brother has cancer in his what's it pancreas in his pancreas and now they did even further uh test today and they saw that it was further spread or something right so we want to take authority over that situation amen distance is not a problem yeah past Ruben could be in Ranon whichever hospital is in I don't even know which hospital but we are here amen but we are not fighting warfar based on territories like provinces so we Ascend the spiritual realm the Heavenly realm I don't know if you remember for months I'm telling you we ascending the spiritual realm amen maybe it sounded like a new phrase to you I told you we Ascend the spiritual realm we're going to high dimensions of the Holy Ghost amen so we don't wrestle against flesh and blood certain on who get dirty will go higher amen amen amen you know Birds you can't fight an eagle in the air amen oh yes praise the Lord amen so let us rise above our circumstance I say nothing shall be impossible to you am I say there's no situation that you are facing right now that God can't deliver you out of thank you Lord thank amen so praise the Lord so today amen as you would know amen I appreciate the prayer Brother s amen hallelujah would have been Pastor Ronnie's birthday and uh would you would have been 72 amen but the Lord didn't see you fit for that he wanted him to be 18 am amen hallelujah so we know he's alive and well in another body yes amen but what I wanted to say was we had a spiritual father in this church amen amen yes that led the church for over 40 years so it's not something we can forget amen we've been on a journey for over 40 years so it's not something we can easily forget amen hallelujah and why I say we are fortunate not a lot of people have spiritual fathers don't worry I'm not choking about crying there's just something stuck in my throat you so don't you don't get emotional and think oh he's so sensitive now and he's crying no so we are Sons we are daughters we have learned from him amen he has taught us valuable lessons and his life itself was a sermon the way he lived he wanted the church you always you knew he wanted the church to prosper he wanted the church to flourish he wanted the church to grow in Christ he was concerned about the Lost amen he was encouraging the church to do Outreach work fulfilling the Great Commission amen hallelujah and even when he came to personal lives he wanted you to progress in your work yes he wanted you to progress in different aspects of your life amen amen because Abraham was not only blessed spiritually yes this Abraham was so blessed that the Lord said even the nations of the world will be blessed Because of You amen so that's the kind of life I want to live that's the kind of life we can live because we are children of Abraham the nations of the earth must be blessed because of us must be blessed because of our presence we are carrying the anointing of God we are carrying the power of God and no demon can stand in our way amen so this evening I was going to speak on Amen the opening up of spiritual Frontiers and take another portion and uh but the Lord walked it out Amen brother the Joshua is going to be sharing the word of the Lord tonight so the Lord willing maybe Sunday we'll touch on those things amen hallelujah how many of you like brother Caleb was saying that the church is in spiritual warfare amen amen amen so what we are saying we we need to be Heavenly minded yes amen so the Lord has been positioning us shaping us molding us sometimes the word is cutting the word is coming in certain ways amen because he wants to get rid of those things because the Lord wants to use us yes amen the only time the Lord will be concerned about us and telling us get rid of this get rid of this do this is because I want to use you yes amen so I want to say Lord let me be a vessel that you can use let's stand together now as we receive the word of the Lord praise the Lord thank you Jesus amen praise the Lord thank you Jesus I want you to be mindful now what we said about Pastor Ruben and we always saying this that while the word is being preached you can speak the desire of your heart amen so when the word is coming in a way and it's encouraging you to speak and it's encouraging you to ask what you will I want you to have his name on your lips today amen amen Pastor Ruben Daniels I want you to have his name on your lips tonight amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen he's worthy to be praised Let's us sing and worship him oh is a great God he's a mighty God Amen oh

supernatural life oh God that is the life of a True Believer father because Lord we are supernatural beings oh god oh we thank you Jesus for the things that you are showing us Lord right now we commit the services into your hands we Comm all things into your hands and we ask that you have the prence over everything now in Jesus name amen amen to God be all the glory amen great things he has done amen yes amen I just I was going to share with you before I start preaching a portion you can have a a portion of my dad Tes but I see didn't share a lot of it but just to share it a little bit from from my angle you know people testify they Testify the way they saw it amen you find the gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John testifying from the angle of the day so amen I'm just remembering as I'm driving to church now the last time when my father had an ar ar attack and I remember the time when he went to pray he was in tears and went to see him in the casualty he was in tears and the first Minister that prayed for him was Pastor Ronnie so I was thinking the first Minister that prayed for him now was brother Adrian so am it was it might seem unusual but certain things happen for certain reasons in people's life you know amen so he was the first Minister that Pastor ad was the first Minister that prayed for him hospital when he had the Art Attack in Gandhi Hospital Pastor Ron was the first person went and saw him as a minister and prayed for him so just a brief uh testimony because I told him today that when you are better when you ful cover and get strength you need to come to our church and you need to testify I said yes as soon as I get my strength I'll do that so on uh he had been sick for a while for a few days until he got very weak and he couldn't make it anymore then Jaa took him to the M hospital and then they did some blood test on him and he was so weak that they put him immediately on a drip and when they did the blood chain test and when the blood st came came out it showed stage four kidney failure that was a blood uh test showing and I believe his blood pressure was low on that same night blood pressure was also dropping so the next Jeff when i ph ja lat night he was going to take him to Gandhi Hospital so I told jaffet they're going to just leave him there and they're not going to be stabilizing him I said bring him to the doctor in the in the bluff the next morning let's get him stabilized before we take him to the hospital because he really needed more drips at the time the Jeffer brought him when my doctor friend checked him out he said I'm surprised your father never going into shock as yet when he looked at the results from the Mage from hospital and then he said he put him immediately on oxygen and he put him on DS he said because in this condition you would have went into shock then uh he took Jeffer and I into his office and he found a kidney specialist and he gave gave him the symptoms and he gave him the readings you know the blood results when he gave the blood results he said this is a very serious condition he said he should be taken to the hospital immediately so I said we we don't have the funds to put him in a private Hospital the best things we could do is take him to the to Ark Khan's hospital the doctor said you can't take him in your car you got to take him in ambulance that's how serious it is so we called an ambulance there and ambulance took him to Khan's hospital and I went there and then being there like the whole entire entire day he was getting weaker and weaker and then by the time we eventually got uh I think I left jefford there for maybe a few hours I said now let me go get something to eat and have a rest and come back soon as I left jefford jefford said when they checked his uh sets the blood pressure and everything it dropped right down and the nurses started to panic they went into a panic mode and they then they put him in immediately into the emergency room and everything was just dropping his blood pressure his arrate and all were dropping so they put him into the emergency room and they started uh Reviving him there and putting back on drips and everything so then I came and spent the rest of the night with him then I think it was late in I don't know midnight for me and he wanted to come there I said I'm thinking that there a man of God that needs to prepare for Sunday and you know everybody knows when you're preparing for the Sunday service you you don't like to be disturbed I said no it's BR just speak the word from where you are but it's fine we are here we pray uh you prepare your service you know you carry on we we are okay so I waited him I waited him for the rest of the night I said dad I it's church tomorrow I need to go at least have 2 hours sleep to have a few few some rest because I need to go to church in the morning I said but I'll leave you here and I'll come and check you out before I go to church so I left him so something got very edgy with me you know like I just work woke up I just woke up watched my face and rush rush to the hospital and he said you'll never then I saw him he's not there where I left him then he was put into an emergency room right in the air with some oxygen on and I said and he said you never believe what happened he said when you left I so much of blood came out so much not even at home and everything so much of blood came out that they got shocked all of them they called the surgical doctors and everything and then they decided to how then they realized how serious he was and they said they have to admit him immediately so they started working on him and I they said they'll admit him so I said okay I'm going to leave you and go to church now but I'll come after they'll come after church and check on him so when I left him and I came to church you know when you leave someone and you know in the from The Human Side I'm saying now you know you're going to get the call from the hospital that's the way I left him because I left him looking I could see death all over his face his face was looking at that he couldn't read properly you couldn't talk it was just his face was right inside his eyes were in and his mouth were in face was dark and even when I left him at night when I was there just before I leave him I was trying to wake him up he couldn't wake up I didn't I just thought he's sleeping but meanwhile his blood pressure dropped right down until they put it on the Monitor and they saw his blood pressure was down so he was going to go into a shock but we I prayed for him and I left him I prayed and I came to church that evening that's when Pastor Adrian went there and then the it was which day it was when we went Shing the break on Tuesday on Tuesday we met the before on Pastor Aiden's lunch break we met at the hospital so Pastor aen prayed for him and he gave him the pillow of fire picture and he said don't look at the man look at the pillow of fire and then as he just trade past Adan trade I spoke I said there's a reason I just pointed I said there's a reason under anointing I said there's a reason there's a delay of the endoscope I said God is working with inside of you amen I said you're going to come out as the testimony by the time they do the scope the report is going to be a good report this was on Tuesday then as it came to the week they even didn't do the scope on Friday then they said no it's a weekend now they leave it for Monday by the time they did the scope they couldn't find anything other than a normal alar Hallelujah and uh and he had a throat infection which was picked up in the hospital when using the oxygen Like A fungi infection and uh that was uh that and then asked him but then how was the kidney because you never gave any treatment for the kidney yeah he said no the the last Blood the latest blood test oh okay before I go to that brother Jaffer did the blood test in the private hospital that's lamon they gave stage four kidney failure the the specialist said is stage four kidney special failure RK Khan's Hospital said we are the government we want to do our own blood test they did the own blood test they said stage four kidney failure when the latest blood test came they said there's nothing wrong with the kidneys at all kidneys are the kid is perfectly normal so because even when when we when that special left they said they was preparing for dialysis immediately when we left that Bluff Medical the kidney specialist was there Jeff and I were there you need to prepare him for that even when they saw him they said but the only only problem is here they need to first to the endoscope but God was delaying all the process cuz he was working but over and above this when Pastor AB gave him the pillow of fire picture and he told him look at that the pillow of fire then that evening when I did the evening visit and I left him I said Lord It's not a good thing to leave my father in a government hospital but I pray that your angel will be with you and I prayed that prayer then he had a supernatural exper which I will let him I don't want to add to that I want to take off I want him to give his own testimony he had his own experience in the hospital so you know I was just thinking about the scripture in 2 Kings 184 it says he removed the eye places and break the images and cut down the growes and break in pieces the Brazen serpent that Moses had made for un through those days the children of Israel he's talking about when ezekiah came into the king and he removed you know the the worship the images that they made they even made a image like how the Brazen serpent which Moses had there now God had that for a purpose at the time but yeah they was worshiping the image now so we know that modern sorry uh the medicine and Doctor are all a sign of Divine Healing but people starting to put their faith in deaths is the same as them worshiping this Graven image amen of Moses serpent when people put their faith on doctors when they put their faith on medicine that's a sign of Divine Healing but the faith must be in Jesus amen yes you need to have your faith in the one that redeemed the one that come to do the work of redemption your faith cannot be on medicine yes yes you need the medicine that's part of Divine Healing it's a sign of Divine Healing you need the good doctors is a it's a sign of Divine Healing but your faith cannot be based on them and that's the problem today people are putting their faith on signs they putting their faith on medicine that is good as idolatry because that's what happened in the book of ezekiah they took at Moses Brad Serpent and they was worshiping they made an image and was worshiping it so our faith must always be in Jesus Christ you know people are looking for the best hospitals the best doctors but our faith must always no matter where you are treated your faith must be in Jesus Christ amen so even when you takeing your medication pray over it amen put your faith in Jesus Christ amen let's stand to our feet just a small exhortation tonight also remembering our pastor Ronnie you know when we say remembering the reason why we remember we don't forget because they live on amen amen they just in another place in a more Superior place than this yes in a more Superior body than this amen so 1 Corinthians 4:14 I write not these things to shame you but as my beloved Sons I warn you for though ye have 10,000 instructors in Christ and I like the way Paul says it and I don't think there were literally 10,000 instructors but watch the way he's saying why he's saying it yet though ye have 10,000 instructors in Christ yet have ye not many fathers amen a lot of people want to come and try and bring the word to you in such a way try and bring the word to reprove you try and bring Doctrine to you and try and show you they how they can see the word but are they a father to you now yes yet have ye not many fathers because a father is a person that's going to nurture someone in Ministry a part A a father is someone that's going to bring them up amen amen it's not only when your good times not wor when your peek of your it's going to bring you up from the bottom amen amen yes it's going to Father you amen yet have ye not many fathers for in Christ I have begotten you through the go El amen wherefore I beseech you be ye followers of me amen you may be SE want to read this one scripture is coming to my head now and I sitting there Isaiah 54 find it oh yes Isaiah 54 2 Isaiah 542 and en llarge the place of thy tents listen to these words enlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth amen the curtains of thine habitations spare not lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy Stakes for thou shallal Break Forth on the right hand and on the left and and thy seed hallelujah amen thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited amen amen amen amen fear not for thou shall not be ashamed yes neither thou be confounded for Thou shalt not be put to shame amen amen I'll leave it as that so I want to speak a few thoughts tonight on extending boundaries amen amen and enlarging spiritual territories amen amen now in order for any church to have that it must have a foundation another wishy-washy found Foundation amen a church need to have a firm foundation based on the word of God Amen yes the foundation cannot be shaky you know we having all this RTP houses and all this proing projects given by tenders today you find people the rush into the foundation and start building and you find the building go shaky you start getting cracks and so forth yes a few years go the line you find crack are coming in the building and they have to go do the reedo the undering because you have to always go back to the foundation if your foundation is not right cracks will come along the way amen amen if the foundation is not right you're not going to proceed further if the foundation is not right you cannot proceed and multi be fruitful and multiply amen so where am I going tonight I'm I'm trying to show you that this ministry had a strong Foundation amen because we had a spiritual father amen we might have had many instructors many people preaching the gospel but it had to have a father amen and in a church okay firstly who started the church yes it was the Holy Ghost which gave birth to the church Church you find that in the book of Acts right but you are find from the time the church is established you have a work of bre so and so a work of bre so and so a work here a work there a work in this city a work in that City amen yes in other words we have different branches but who is the vine Christ is the vine amen and out of Christ produced branches yes amen and out of the branches he's given you Shepherds amen amen now it's like how you've got you got like a a main company right and from that company you got different franchises different branches let's look at your motor industry you got your main headquarters right and then you got your small branches not every Branch perform the same is that right right not every branch is successful for example you might have a game stores throughout the country not every game store is successful not every game store bring good returns but if that game store got good leadership amen if he got good governance if it abides by his policies amen amen if it got things in order yeah it's going to be successful amen and then it's going to raise up other good leaders other managers yes amen if it's got a good team working together amen if that store realizes this is where we losing money we do a a loss if we do a a order check and see this is where we losing prophets we need to work on this area this is the area that we are lacking yes and then they work on the things that they are lacking yes amen and then they have a team building together to work together as a team yeah you find that being a successful store amen amen and you find that branch is different from the other branches amen so likewise Christ is a vine but there are many branches so we are part of a branch amen and we got to make sure that this Branch bear forth fruits but we don't want it to just bear forth fruit we want it to be fruitful and multiply amen if you look at Genesis 49 22 it says Joseph is a fruitful bow now Joseph is typing Perfection right even a fruitful Bow by a well whose branches run over the wall am this is Genesis 49:22 so we're talking about extending territory extending spiritual Frontiers amen amen now it he saying Joseph is a fruitful Bow by a well which is good because why he's drawing from a well he's drawing from the main from the water right we drawing from this inexhaustible Fountain of Life but it says whose branches run over the wall amen now it's extending its boundaries amen amen it it's by a well but it's running over the wall now and then the archers have sorely grieved him and shuted him and hated him but his bow of B in strength and the HMS of his hands were made Strong by the hands of the by the Mighty God of Jacob even by the god of thy father who shall help thee and by the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of Heaven above blessings of the deep that lith under the blessings of the breast and of the womb so you find that yeah the Bible is saying us that Joseph Jacob now is blessing Joseph and he's saying you are Joseph is a fruitful bow even a fruitful B well because if you look at Joseph he extended beyond the borders of Israel and his ministry was what for the preservation of life for the whole world at that time amen so what is what is the ministry of the Bride when thou must prophesy again before Nation tongue and Kindred is she not kept for such a time for the preservation of life it is not Mery Grace upon the Earth it is not the final voice in his final day amen amen but if your foundations are not right sons have to be brought up by a father amen you find even in the natural if a son doesn't have a children that don't have fathers are not brought up rights it makes a big difference with a with a child having a father so how much more spiritually now we find that people say no the Lord called me I'm going to preach and never grow out was never brought up in Ministry by a father then whatever Ministry they going they're going to be shaky amen they want have a firm foundation because your spiritual father is going to guide you yes he's going to look at your life he going to have discernment yes he's going to discern your life amen he's going to see where you are lacking spiritually and you're going to he going to see what you need to grow amen amen you know I'm thinking of the time when when we first started in ministry as Paul said yet we had many instructors we also were I was taken back with beautiful Ministries will tell you we should always admire different Ministries the 54 Ministry different teachings and all that but you know one thing about Pastor Ronnie he never got Amazed by any different Ministries he said now let's take it back to the word let's see what the prophet is saying about it let's see what the Bible says about it and in any situation cuz I went with him you know when he counsel with people say let's see what the Bible says about it let's see what the word says about it so you find that a spiritual father he also knows his son if someone say they spiritual father to you they must have theer they need to know you amen they need to understand whether this person is the right person for the ministry not that someone just say okay you're looking good you have the right stature physically you have the the right you can speak well eloquently you are the right person for the ministry that is not a spiritual father a spiritual father must have discernments am say this person might not be there right now but I can see something in this person amen there's some potential in his person that's why when when Samuel went to choose when he was looking on the natural God was looking on the inside God knew God is God already had his man that's why a spiritual father father a Shepherd you got to tap with God Amen you got to be connected with God and God got to show him who to choose as his spiritual Sons how to grow them up amen and if the and if the foundation was right then they must be an extension of borders amen amen amen if the the foundation was right then this Branch must bear forth much fruits it must be fruitful and multiply amen and not R to De generation and must must take it over to other Generations amen it must be a passing of inheritance am amen that's how you see the fruits of a Min a true Ministry when you can see the younger generation now going to take up the B amen they passing it on and they working on the younger gener they have discernment to see what to work on what what aspect in their life they need to work on and then you see the fruits of it it might take a long time these things require patience amen these things are not done with overnight because this is not wishy-washy stuff amen amen this is genuine stuff now therefore you find in the early Ministries the early ministers their job was to get C correct amen they had to labor in that and the reason why they had to lab in that because the foundation wasn't right cracks was going to come along the way and the buling was going to fall amen but thank God for he was in control of all things Paul says in one Corinthians 36 he says who then is Paul and who is Aus yes but ministers whom ye believed yes even as the lord gave to every man I have planted apus watered but God gave the increase so then neither is he that planted anything neither he that watered it but God that giveth the increase so you got to watch the fruits of any Ministry and see if God was in it because there must be an increase amen you cannot remain the same you've got to extend the borders amen amen when when when Joshua took them there and Joshua wasn't just satisfied with people just coming in there and taking he wanted them to extend their borders amen he wanted them to be successful in that land because even God said to him if you don't turn to the left don't turn to the right you'll have good success if you only keep the words what I've send you you you should have good success amen so if you can look at your life to say am I disatisfied with where I want to be whether it's naturally physically or whatever I'm talking about spiritually as well which is the main part of it am I satisfied with just calling myself a church believer or do I want to find out what is God's purpose for my life amen where do God want me to be yes and if you attend to if you have that real sincere desire you know who God is going to reveal it to Joshua and who is Joshua coming to the ministry amen so if you're attentive and have the right attitude God is going to show you where you're supposed to be amen amen I thought I was I was satisfied with just receiving the message when I came in I was so excited that there was something I never saw in my whole life and this was the best thing that ever happened I wasn't preaching was the last thing I would have thought of in this message I'm talking about when I came to the message I wasn't thinking about preaching I was satisfied wow God sent a prophet God spoke about a a message that's going to take us to the Rapture there was a message is going to change us and take us to the Rapture wow I was seeing all these things I didn't know I'll be a minister in this message but there was a Shepherd a spiritual father that said to me start we and preaching took me one day out of the Blues said you go and preach and open a meeting training ground I said but open a I haven't preached in open a meeting and you'll all know about the first experience that he went out he said no I want you to go preach there then from there he said no you take the wedness day service because it was training ground amen like I'm reminding like when I to take cable Caleb for driving lessons a father must take do this things with their children you take them on training ground and you get them ready to go for the test so you see two spiritual fathers will identify but they could see see what we couldn't see at that time they could see what we couldn't see you understand amen so therefore sometime you get the minist you say you want you to do something for the Lord you might think but I'm just in significant I'm just a normal person in the church but the ministry is asking to do the specific thing for the Lord because they can see something that you can't see because discernment is in the church because the the vision of the ministry is to enlar LGE the territory to enlarge the borders they're not satisfied with the local assembly no the local assembly is just equipping you it's bullying you but you are here you getting trained as soldiers because you are going out you're going to enlarge the Border you taking the ministry out amen yes Lord amen amen and right now we also fighting spiritual battle we fighting demon warfar now you hear the prayer request from the past in Johannesburg we might not be in Johannesburg but we extending our borders there now God has put the gift in the church if he placed the gift in this body this part of the body remember he's got the body right and each one got their own part to play in the body now if God has placed the gift in this part of the body let's extend our bodies send the gift out there how you can help as the church is create the right atmosphere Hallelujah create the right atmosphere where no demon Spirits are welcome so let's send out the gifts through the atmosphere through the airwaves through the atmospheres amen till the angel of God is going out there amen amen yes that's what we're talking about extending the borders so Jeremiah 3:15 says and I will give you pasts according to mine Hearts amen who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding amen so you can't be coming to a church and saying that you have a pastor but you don't have knowledge and understanding of the word because a true Pastor is going to feed you amen a true Shepherd is going to feed you the true word amen and he and he knows his children you know this one can't dig so much this one I got to give him just a little bit this one he want strong meat this one got this problem we need to deal with that that's a true Shepherd now a true Shepherd know every one of the Sheep amen amen he knows the Sheep the Sheep must have maybe got a sickness the Sheep got a problem the shepherd knows that he said this one here I cannot leave him alone I got to watch this one here amen this one year I got to watch it because if I leave it it's going to fall off the cliff oh yes this one yeah is keep running away even though I'm rebuking and rebuking I'm going have to break it leg because they love the Sheep Jesus said John 10:11 said I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep but he that is in the highing and not the shepherd who own who's own the Sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the Sheep you see the one who's not connected with the great Shepherds yes right that's an ising Shepherd but the one who's called ordained before the foundation of the world gifts and calling are without repentance that means you are to be born with the gift not someone lay hands on you and say now you a pastor amen that you went to some Bible College and someone made you a pastor because you got some diploma no you was born with the gift amen yes amen so leave with the sheep and flee and the Wolf catched them and Scatter scattered the Sheep theing flee and he himself fleeth when the trouble comes he flee it because he is an ising and carth not for the Sheep but Jesus said I am the Good Shepherd amen and know my sheep and am known of mine someone say but Jesus is talking about himself no where is Jesus yes where is Jesus veiled in this hour amen as the father knoweth me even so I the so know I the father and lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep I have which are not of the SW them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd amen so you see how serious jesus takes this thought of having a good shepherd yes you see how serious this is and he Likens them to Shepherd and sheep because Shepherds it's not like why didn't say herder or a person that look after pigs or person that look after cattle why you didn't say Shepherd talking about a shepherd and a sheep because a Shepherd become one with a sheep a Shepherd you see sheep sheep cannot be lit on their own that's right yes sheep has to be led and therefore God himself so it fit this is my sheep I can't put an island in there I got to put my own there amen so before a true Shepherd is born even before they born they ordained to be there and at that appointed time in that season you going to look after my sheep am that's why Jesus said to Peter feed my sheep said to him again feed my sheep said to him feed my lamb amen so Jesus was concerned about these things but we talking about a Ministry that stood the test of time we're talking about a Ministry that not remain stagnant because 40 years plus plus now or the time Pastor Ronnie ran the ministry 40 years Ministry the the test of where it took the time was where it extended the Border where it extended the wall and became fruitful where it became a fruitful Ministry but the fruits you shall know them am the way to judge a Ministry is by the fruits amen because you know there's many Ministries around the world that soon as something happens to the shepherd the ministry falls apart and it happened in big Ministries many M big name Ministries the church fell apart and they not progressing further but you find that if a minister is truly called of God and he got his foundation rights he got his Branch running rights amen and then his branch is in order then it must bear forth fruit it must become fruitful so you can imagine now you got all the share holders waiting for the dividence and this branch is not doing well how are they going to get the dividend if this branch is not making money we talking about in the natural law if the branch is not doing well they say you got a car industry right a car franchise and that car franchise is not doing well how the shareholders going to get the dividends from there then there's something wrong with the branch but who do you go checkl in the branch the GP the one that's running the branch because something's wrong with the leadership day that's right so if a church remains stagnant and is not progressing and is not moving beyond his boundaries then there's something wrong with the ministry there's a leadership problem but if the church is progressing from Glory unto Glory from strength to strength from Grace to Grace amen amen and they progressing in the revelation of the word from drawing from his inexhaustible Fountain of Life and the word is becoming clearer and clearer then you know that this is a Ministry with a good which had a good foundation amen and now it's progressing over the world Amen it's becoming a fruitful bow extending his boundaries amen and therefore now is ready to take on spiritual Frontiers amen hallelujah you can't go take on spiritual Frontiers if you are shaky you can't take on spiritual Frontiers if you don't have that Foundation solid how can you extend out if your foundation can't hold firm fir yes amen but if the foundation is firm you got to have the wise master builder amen present amen yes the wise Master bull got to be in action you've got to be the one that started the foundation and if the wise Master bull started that and the foundation is solid it can now extend the boundaries and if you see what God is doing I'm just having a talk to the church amen if you can see what God is doing spiritually speaking then you can see where God is ready to take us the question we need to ask ourselves are we ready to Avail ourselves for the next step are we are we ready to completely surrender ourselves are we ready now if today tomorrow you get a call from the pastor say we got a demon case or we got a life and dead situation I need to come I need you to come with me are you ready to go there or you going to say no I'm just satisfied you got to know your position amen amen now not everybody is called to do that but they got to be those soldiers those gallon soldiers amen amen you can't just leave everything for the pastor or another ministering brother you got to have G soldiers in the assembly say Pastor I understand you can't make it there I will go to the I will go for that case there's a demon case in his house I will go take it amen don't worry brother Pastor I will go there it's a life and dead situation I'm going there I'm prayed up now don't go and look for praying up that time you better live a life pray that amen and you better know what you're talking about when you're facing a demon amen the first thing is to have discernment you got to discern the spirit yes you got to speak you know you know we we Face different people and different uh they say psychologists can spend a few minutes with you and buy your just by your facial makeup they can tell you what's wrong with you but discernment is different discernment don't just see the out amen you can even cover the outfit you can put a camouflage on the outside discernment goes inside it diagnoses inside you and it Contex what type of spirit is influencing you so Ephesians 4 4 says there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ amen so we given Grace by the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he said when he ascended upon us he led captivity captive and he gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might fulfill all things and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pasts and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ but what what he says in verse 14 he says that we end fought being no more children toss to and fro amen and carried about with every wind of Doctrine yes amen so it become questionable into whether a person is under a true five-fold Ministry when they are tossed to and fro with every wi of Doctrine but the slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into into him in all things which is the head even Christ so you see if you got a true fire for Ministry you will not be tossed to and fro with every wi of Doctrine and that must be proved through the through the test of time amen and I know one thing starting from the foundations of P R's Ministry he wasn't TS to and fr he wasn't taken away by different doctrines that were coming by he stood in the center and he stood with the word and he stood he stood with what was given to him by God he didn't to whatever God gave him as his gift he stood it and then from there the batt is passed on and then he progressing to different to where God has placed the shepherd now and from where God placed the shepherd now is progressing to the people into where God is placing them now amen therefore you got to have the obedient voice amen and here what the Lord is speaking through the 54 Ministry where God is placing you positionally amen because only when you come into your position yes amen then you come to your adoption ceremony yes amen it starts from the shepherd first it starts from the five until the fivefold is adopted if the fivefold is not adopted come to the adoption ceremony then there's a problem you cannot progress further than death yes amen you hear the testimony of brother Caleb it came from the pulpit it came from the preaching that you must speak the word it came from the fivefold that you must speak the word and he took it amen so you see how it come you see God the order of things so God doesn't do things apparantly he does things in his order and he doesn't change it so you got to come into your position when you come into your position you come to your adoption ceremony amen and then when you come to your to your adoption ceremony you are now ready to go take on ERS take on Frontiers amen the only thing that will be left behind for you the only thing outstanding or the final part which is not even for you to do that part will happen you will have a body change but your part you must fulfill Hallelujah the other part you will get it you do your part and he'll do his part amen amen because from that Dimension come for your theophany to dve tail with you and touch me your theop want to Dove tail with something that is in the same image amen that two must be one amen it has to when you're using the word dovetail you must come to the image that you bypass amen oh yes but you are changing because you are coming to the word image as you are eating of the word yes and you can only come through that through the true fivefold Ministry and any through five4 Ministry must have the right foundations but we thank God you don't have to say you don't have to brag and say we got it the fruits will speak for itself when they ask Jes when when they asked Jes John the Baptist asked them if he's the one to come he said go tell him what I've been doing and when they spoke to that blind man they saying uh about Jesus said I don't know about all that he's saying all I know I once I was blind but now I can see yes and the people talk to you about medical say I don't know what you're talking about all I can say that person was sick now they are healed was saying this but this is what he's saying now that's all I can tell you amen because the same Jesus that was in there he here today the same yesterday today and forever bless you [Applause] stand amen amen so I don't want to go too long I just wanted to speak on these things on uh extending our borders but starting from the foundation because speaking about how that we had a spiritual Father Who had who established the church with a firm foundation amen and now we can see the fruits of it the fruits of the ministry and not just fruits now it's becoming fruitful and is not just satisfied being by the well drawing there it's extending Beyond the Wall so it's going Beyond the Wall amen amen the spiritual wall that is going beyond that extending beyond the boundaries you see all the things are in the scripture we might not have saw it before but it's becoming clearer to us amen everything you say must be scriptural amen must come back to the word that's what we were thought that's our foundation must come back to the scripture you leave the scripture you get the correct amen so God richly bless you to amen thank you Lorden amen that was wonderful you appreciate the word let's give the Lord a good ank of Praise amen that was beautiful brother Joshua amen the way you put it across the way you brought things amen hallelujah and we know that's the leadership of the Holy Ghost to come and bring more clarity to certain aspects amen hallelujah I don't know if you are ready to enlarge your borders amen amen so we were reading there 1 Chronicles chapter 4 how a man named jabz amen yeah he said oh that you would bless me indeed and that you would enlarge my territory you would enlarge my borders amen hallelujah and then he says that your hand of protection will be on me so I'm saying we need to have that same desire for the Lord to enlarge our borders amen hallelujah let's just sing and worship him let's just thank him for the word
