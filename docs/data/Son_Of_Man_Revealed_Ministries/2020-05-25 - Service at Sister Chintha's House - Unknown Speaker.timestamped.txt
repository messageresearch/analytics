[10:06] you may not greet you all in the
[10:08] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[10:10] Jesus Christ amen I believe without
[10:15] Jesus Christ will have no hope tonight
[10:16] amen but I believe the reason we have
[10:20] hope tonight and we have an assurance to
[10:23] know there our dear mother is gone on to
[10:26] be with a maker hmm the one she
[10:28] confessed when she mentioned the name
[10:30] Jesus she wasn't talking about a story
[10:32] every time she mentioned the name Jesus
[10:34] was somebody in the family she wasn't
[10:37] talking about a fairy tale today amen
[10:39] she was talking about the person Jesus
[10:41] Christ that she has come to know
[10:43] personally and accepted him as her Lord
[10:47] and Savior personally I'm sure you know
[10:51] that she wasn't talking about joining
[10:53] church she wasn't talking about joining
[10:55] a religion but she kept speaking about
[10:57] Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ became
[11:01] personally known to her the one that's
[11:03] come and died for us and they died for
[11:06] all of us that we might have life and
[11:08] have it more abundantly
[11:09] when the enemy has come to steal and
[11:11] destroy but the Bible said he has come
[11:14] to give life and give it more of an
[11:16] early I would like to take our reading
[11:18] tonight
[11:19] in the book of Matthew sorry the book of
[11:22] Mark chapter date reading from verses 35
[11:25] the Bible says for whosoever will save
[11:29] his life shall lose it but whosoever
[11:33] shall lose his life for my sake and the
[11:36] Gospels the same shall save it for what
[11:41] shall it profit a man if he gain the
[11:43] whole world and lose his own soul
[11:46] what shall a man give in exchange for
[11:49] his soul whosoever therefore shall be
[11:53] ashamed of me and of my words in this
[11:56] adulterous and sinful generation of him
[12:00] also shall the Son of Man be ashamed
[12:02] when he cometh in the glory of his
[12:04] father with the Holy Angels he man you
[12:07] may be seated thank God for the reading
[12:10] of his words so I think the Bible is
[12:14] saying what shall it profit a man to
[12:16] gain the whole world and lose his own
[12:20] soul what the Bible is speaking about
[12:24] here is that everything around us is
[12:29] temporal hmm everything that matters to
[12:32] this material life and the physical form
[12:36] and everything that pertains to the five
[12:38] senses is all a temporal life amen and
[12:43] if we invested time in a temporal life
[12:48] invested all our energy all our efforts
[12:52] all our years to try to gain things for
[12:59] the temporal life but have not spend
[13:04] time emphasizing and investing on that
[13:09] which is eternal then we have a problem
[13:13] when it comes to the time of death amen
[13:17] because that is something that no man
[13:22] can say I know exactly when I'm going to
[13:25] die he no man knows the day an hour when
[13:29] he is time on earth is done each
[13:33] father put you on God's program hmm God
[13:36] as the spot God has given each of us a
[13:41] character and a part to play in his
[13:43] great play and display of redemption
[13:48] each of us as the time allotted to us no
[13:52] man can say for sure which time what did
[13:55] our his life will be taken away but one
[13:59] thing we do know for sure the Bible says
[14:01] for God so loved the world that He gave
[14:04] His only begotten Son that whosoever
[14:08] shall believe on Him shall not perish
[14:10] but have eternal life
[14:12] amen so one thing we do know for sure
[14:14] that we can have eternal life
[14:16] hmm and we can have it only to Jesus
[14:22] Christ goodness and the way that he has
[14:25] provided for us and he hasn't provided a
[14:28] true religion hmm he's providing it God
[14:32] has provided to his son Jesus Christ a
[14:34] man was come and paid the ultimate price
[14:36] for us but he find that people on today
[14:39] they look at the life journey and he
[14:43] focused so much so much on this temporal
[14:48] life we find that when Sun crept in
[14:54] right there in the beginning in the
[14:56] Garden of Eden when Sun crappie brought
[15:00] death to the human race the Bible says
[15:05] God said to man on the day you eat of
[15:07] the fruit on death day you shall surely
[15:09] die so since started in the Garden of
[15:14] Eden hmm and how did sin come through
[15:17] the first Adam amen but God is a God of
[15:23] many characteristics and one of the
[15:25] greatest characteristics of God is being
[15:28] a savior repentance and to play the part
[15:31] of being a Savior man had to follow and
[15:35] God knew men was going to fall and Jesus
[15:38] Christ has come to make a way for
[15:41] mankind amen
[15:43] that man lost is way
[15:46] God but Jesus Christ comes to sending
[15:49] back to God
[15:50] amen amen God was in Jesus Christ
[15:53] reconciling the whole world to himself
[15:55] amen so he wants to turn the human odds
[15:58] we find that that the god of this evil
[16:01] age which is Satan what started in the
[16:05] Garden of Eden and 6,000 years he made
[16:08] this world into his Eden you don't
[16:14] believe that when Jesus was on the earth
[16:16] 2,000 years ago he told Jesus if you bow
[16:19] down to me then you can have all the
[16:21] kingdom of thoughts he offered it to
[16:24] Jesus Christ and now he's made this
[16:27] world his own either and he's been
[16:29] influencing men how is he being fluency
[16:32] man through the five senses touch feel
[16:35] taste smell yeah and he's been
[16:39] influencing man
[16:40] all through 6,000 years to turn away
[16:42] from God and man was trying to satisfy a
[16:46] desire within him but that desire God
[16:49] put it in men their desire that God man
[16:52] had he had a trust within himself he had
[16:56] a trust he was longing for something he
[16:57] was testing for something and he to
[17:00] satisfy the test he found other men to
[17:03] satisfy the test but those methods were
[17:06] temporal methods he could have turned to
[17:09] drugs he could have turned to the world
[17:11] he could have turned to gambling
[17:13] whatever he could he could turn to
[17:16] living a life in pleasure and he was
[17:18] temporal measure he true satisfaction
[17:20] and to satisfy the thirst that man had
[17:24] would only come to Jesus Christ and God
[17:27] has made that way so if I know dear
[17:30] sister has come and a life on Earth may
[17:34] not have been the easy life a life on
[17:37] Earth from time to time had been a
[17:38] struggle mm-hmm and every day as she
[17:44] progressed into a age old age it might
[17:48] have been a struggle for her to live but
[17:51] would inner something was happened
[17:54] already happened in Edmond and was
[17:56] continuing to take place she was being
[17:58] renewed
[17:59] today with investment a man the Bible
[18:03] says it's a lot Ananda man threescore
[18:06] and ten tulu that's a full life and the
[18:09] rest is grace how dear sister has lived
[18:12] on grace graceful years in the Lord you
[18:15] see this will always prove that
[18:18] everybody wanted what is what will be
[18:21] like life after death but Jesus come to
[18:24] contact death and the grave we went
[18:28] through the way of death but he rose
[18:30] over the third day and now as the keys
[18:33] of death and the grave that's right
[18:36] Jesus took the sting out of deaths
[18:38] that's why death is not the end of life
[18:41] for the believer yet is what is at door
[18:45] the doorways to go eternal life amen
[18:49] the Bible says in first Corinthians in 1
[18:55] Corinthians 5:1 for we know that if our
[18:58] earthly House of this Tabernacle be
[19:01] desorbed
[19:01] we have a building of God and house not
[19:06] made with hands eternal in the heavens
[19:08] in other words what body Apostle Paul is
[19:11] saying he deserves a tabernacle he
[19:14] basically house he does body dies we
[19:17] already have another body waiting for us
[19:20] amen even when this body takes his last
[19:22] breath when you look at your loved ones
[19:25] taking the last breaths he's because the
[19:27] life the soul comes out of that body and
[19:30] goes into a celestial body hmm you
[19:33] looking at the terrestrial body made of
[19:35] this ugly ugly element but there's
[19:40] another body would same physique and
[19:43] everything but in the prime of life that
[19:45] body is no more suffering that body is
[19:48] no more faint and body cannot decay that
[19:51] body doesn't age a man everyone is in a
[19:54] prime of life in that body hmm how does
[19:57] this dear sister is now rejoicing amen
[20:00] every is not a place where you just go
[20:02] and somebody plays a harp and sing along
[20:05] everybody is a real place a man
[20:07] everybody is a place first far more
[20:10] superior than the Sun a man it's it in
[20:14] fact this earth is gone in such a DK the
[20:17] children of God cannot live here any
[20:19] longer and God one of these days he's
[20:22] going to take the take away his children
[20:23] amen and you only breathe back off these
[20:26] innovates the hmm but every is a real
[20:28] place where do you see a lovely one
[20:31] taking the last breath it means a life
[20:33] the real life comes out of the body the
[20:36] earthly body the temporal body and they
[20:38] step into the real body they step into a
[20:42] celestial body think of them in the
[20:45] prime of life maybe in the 20s that's
[20:48] how that that's how they will be looking
[20:49] on that night so if you want to to go to
[20:53] the place we are near mother's gone you
[20:55] got to live the life that she looked you
[20:58] got to come to know the Savior that she
[20:59] loves a man if you want to have
[21:01] fellowship with her game hmm you are a
[21:03] fellowship when I make it you gonna have
[21:06] fellowship what I God go thank God has
[21:09] promised a journalist amen
[21:11] you can read any religious book in the
[21:13] world no no way and no religious book
[21:16] said I lay down my life and I'll raise
[21:19] it up again
[21:20] no way that it says God gave his game of
[21:24] eternal life to anyone but through Jesus
[21:27] Christ amen God has only given eternal
[21:30] life through His Son Jesus Christ
[21:32] whosoever shall accept him amen the
[21:35] Bible says in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4
[21:42] but I would not have you to be ignorant
[21:45] brethren concerning them which are
[21:47] asleep that ye sorrow not even as others
[21:51] which have no hope see when the Apostle
[21:54] Paul is speaking now he's saying those
[21:58] that died in the faith we must not be
[22:01] ignorant of this no matter when we
[22:04] sorrow it's when he met some that we
[22:08] will follow it's what he naturally we
[22:10] will feel saddened because we must our
[22:12] loved one it's only natural there'll be
[22:14] times when we think about them and we
[22:17] have to think about them and talk
[22:19] but we must not serve as those that have
[22:22] no hope in other words what he's saying
[22:24] don't always if you never get a see them
[22:26] again event they not gone for eternal
[22:29] life I mean for eternity away from us we
[22:33] are going to be joined with them amen
[22:35] so I have this Hopi saying for we if we
[22:38] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[22:40] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[22:44] will God bring with him for this we say
[22:49] unto you by the word of the Lord that we
[22:51] which are alive and remain unto the
[22:53] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[22:55] them which are asleep for the Lord
[22:59] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[23:01] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[23:04] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[23:06] Christ shall rise first and we which are
[23:10] alive and remain shall be caught up
[23:11] together with them in the clouds to meet
[23:13] the Lord and so shall we ever be with
[23:15] the Lord
[23:16] we are living in the time where the
[23:18] speak people are speaking about things
[23:21] of coming to the end of the world or the
[23:24] end of the world system as we know it
[23:26] we only be the time of a great pandemic
[23:29] on the earth and man don't have the
[23:32] answers as to what is going on we are
[23:34] living in structural times with the
[23:36] Bible said as it was in the days of lots
[23:39] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[23:41] it be in the coming of the Son of man we
[23:44] are living the time that Jesus
[23:45] prophesied about he spoke about the
[23:47] condition that the world will be in
[23:50] mother's evils sin would be on the earth
[23:54] until Jesus comes so we know that we are
[23:58] living in the end times and one of these
[24:00] days Jesus is coming back but what you
[24:03] say is going to happen first there must
[24:04] be a resurrection a man those having
[24:07] died in Christ must arise first mmm and
[24:11] we are living in such a close hour now
[24:13] to the coming of the Lord the question
[24:16] is is our hearts ready mm-hmm oh did we
[24:19] know Jesus Christ personally I'm not
[24:22] asking to be join a church did we go be
[24:24] religious I'm not asking are we fasting
[24:26] and praying
[24:26] and and be religious but do you know
[24:29] Jesus Christ personally if he personally
[24:32] is revealed to you did you accept him as
[24:34] your Lord and Savior and you made him
[24:36] lord over your life do you making have
[24:40] you made investment for your soul have
[24:43] you allow Jesus to come into every
[24:46] compartment of your heart Eve I'm not
[24:48] just saying Jesus coming to moderate Tom
[24:50] but when he comes to every compartment
[24:52] it means all the things that are not of
[24:55] God you who don't you allow him to come
[24:59] be Lord of your life
[25:00] and allow the Holy Spirit that he
[25:03] promised to come and root out everything
[25:06] that is not of him that he must come and
[25:09] be Lord of your life if you did that
[25:12] because we are living in such a close
[25:14] hour where Jesus from Jesus spoke of all
[25:17] these things that are happening on the
[25:18] earth all these things enough unknown
[25:20] this Bible said to be pestilences me
[25:21] there'll be famines there'll be all
[25:24] these plagues on yes what you see now is
[25:27] what the Bible said what we see now is
[25:29] that I knew unusual to us we are living
[25:33] in the time the Bible's for but in these
[25:36] times are we do we ever get pinched dogs
[25:38] are we saying Lord I want to make my
[25:41] life right with you lord I want to know
[25:44] you Lord what what does the word speak
[25:47] about his time that we living in Lord
