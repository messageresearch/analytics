[18:08] [Music]
[18:22] [Music]
[18:32] the resurrection give it praise and
[18:36] glory that's one thing the problem said
[18:40] he also says we come for correction we
[18:46] come to erase resurrection
[18:49] now another Pope he was making some
[18:53] pretty B's publication there then they
[18:58] wanna change but they are worship to set
[19:02] today and the one that was true seventh
[19:07] they need to spend time with the family
[19:09] and and just relax that's one of these
[19:15] desires so you won't be surprised with
[19:18] that the New World Order starts they
[19:21] might change it saturday is a complete
[19:25] any of reds for everybody that's an
[19:28] order they'll have to follow but the
[19:30] Bible tells us that you know after the
[19:33] resurrection they gathered on the first
[19:35] day of the week amen
[19:38] well Jesus was there with the disciples
[19:40] preaching it all they went to the
[19:43] synagogues to preach down Saturday but
[19:47] how with the resurrection the gathered
[19:48] on the first day of the week that is
[19:50] Sunday see but he's got a bright idea I
[19:53] said the world is too pressurized now
[19:56] and and people really need rested stay
[20:00] at home and spend time with your family
[20:02] and everything else in with which is
[20:05] true they are stressed out and they no
[20:07] rest and he wants to make them Aurora
[20:11] but the body tells us our risk is a
[20:15] Sabbath is the host friends alone that's
[20:19] our true 7th event we give all glory
[20:24] when he comes in establish all what he
[20:27] wants a video from the earth yes God
[20:29] will take it and we find that then in
[20:33] the spec now he can fend for himself you
[20:38] know in this disaster nobody can come to
[20:41] anybody's risky the trying everything
[20:44] they can
[20:44] and violence America is burning at the
[20:48] moment this division in the country
[20:52] listen to the news this morning they do
[20:55] know what happened there but he was
[20:57] running away from the police and they
[20:58] shot him so that sparked another night
[21:01] there and then all of America is in the
[21:04] right us control himself
[21:24] yes chapter 14 that will be from verse
[22:25] 36 and our topic is centered on
[22:29] predestination but coach called method
[22:36] of saving us
[22:37] and now it can't be saved any other way
[22:41] and I'll be caught that you can't have
[22:43] any other way we said long before we
[22:47] came here we read the stocks and then
[22:49] see if that was years ago
[22:54] see we weigh the stocks so he starts to
[22:58] express your love so we have express
[23:01] thoughts of gods so let's go to the Old
[23:04] Testament it's a flat so today we read
[23:06] from this 36 against him by bringing up
[23:11] a slob day upon the land even those men
[23:14] that did bring up the evil report upon
[23:16] the land died by the play before the
[23:19] Lord right by the son of nun and Caleb
[23:23] the son of Jephunneh which were of the
[23:26] men that went to search the land live
[23:29] stove so only from the 12 that God said
[23:34] I supposed to set the clock right only
[23:39] two of them Joshua and Caleb but not
[23:43] killing them because they were prepared
[23:47] to do what God told ya so let me spray
[23:50] Jesus we thank you love you Jason thank
[23:53] you all for your mercy Lord Lord is by
[23:56] your mercy we learn every day forgive us
[23:59] our shortcomings Lord we pray that you
[24:01] be with us this morning we come you said
[24:04] whenever two or three I gathered your
[24:05] name your he novice thank you Lord for
[24:08] this glorious day we thank you Lord for
[24:11] that a word that is already preached by
[24:13] profiting man in the message shallow
[24:16] loss darkness upon this earth yes Lord
[24:20] the word said rise and shine our light
[24:23] is come yes do ya lets our hearts and
[24:26] maybe press one thank you Jesus the way
[24:29] that you touch them in and they are
[24:30] great people there you go buddy ask it
[24:33] in Jesus precious name thanks amen
[24:36] according as it was a division when the
[24:40] widget to be for foes everything had to
[24:43] be as you saw it in the vision and there
[24:46] if the property was in the play
[24:48] said he knows now the Lord is gonna work
[24:51] and he waited for everything to come
[24:54] into place I think the very early days
[24:58] there was a little sick baby to be
[25:00] playful and the Lord showing the
[25:03] grandmother will be set ablaze and the
[25:05] father will be giving and their salute
[25:07] something was in his place God
[25:10] I think brother Jeff what you post for
[25:12] that speak God waits for everything to
[25:15] come he is coming into place the
[25:17] Antichrist is coming to place revelation
[25:21] 13 is coming into play and the black
[25:23] chairs not appoint one day he's not
[25:25] gonna spread out for a couple of days
[25:27] till one day the hubs is that last one
[25:34] is that he was preaching in the hotel
[25:39] you know I made me eat this up till
[25:41] tonight not important at all see the
[25:44] predestinated so we must all always pray
[25:47] for that but the message of the hour
[25:49] see and you might end after that there
[25:52] wasn't that last one you see everything
[25:54] is gonna come into place in other words
[25:57] the rapture won't go until that last one
[25:59] give you this land and birth order
[26:02] it's a good land you better find
[26:05] everything there to live
[26:07] you're not going to come shop but I said
[26:10] to Moses cannot twelve men from the
[26:14] twelve tribes they have the rule is from
[26:16] each fire and said then twelve let them
[26:20] go and bring the evidence bring the
[26:23] evidence first
[26:24] praise the Lord so Moses did that call
[26:27] the twelve men from each of the twelve
[26:29] tribes and the book of Revelation 13
[26:34] sorry numbers 13 names each one that was
[26:38] taken from each row man and so the wind
[26:42] a the spies went and they were there for
[26:44] forty days they spied out the land and
[26:49] everything else in and they brought the
[26:51] evidence and the broth pomegranates the
[26:54] broad figs and the broth and so much of
[26:56] grapes the budgets were so big two
[26:59] minutes
[27:00] Kenny maybe they put and walk through
[27:04] the Charlie now the candy what had all
[27:08] in the past so they brought the evidence
[27:11] and the product they had this said to
[27:15] Moses here's the evidence we look like
[27:19] grasshoppers in the sight
[27:22] there is a the children on the event and
[27:25] God was very angry with and God came and
[27:30] told Andrew sit here you people
[27:33] Joshua and Caleb said let us go up at
[27:37] once
[27:38] amen then we're not going to fear any
[27:40] giant saw or anybody I believe what God
[27:44] said
[27:46] reading you know you get the little
[27:50] writings there before the part and in
[27:53] there in the group and that's a Hebrew
[27:56] and the Greek translation is Jesus amen
[28:00] so that's why he was born and able to
[28:04] say we're gonna go over and he catch the
[28:07] Holy Ghost today so who is a leader
[28:10] today the Holy Ghost he's leaving us
[28:15] later on and the K loop is the faithful
[28:19] believers and the Bible says there was
[28:22] another spirit in Caleb and then so
[28:26] these two are fearless to go over and
[28:30] take over and when when these people
[28:32] died Moses came and told the people and
[28:35] they all born that said listen here let
[28:37] us get a leader we want to go back to
[28:39] Egypt God you brought us here to die we
[28:44] want to go back to Egypt it'd been
[28:47] better to stay over there and he said
[28:50] you know what the children of you can
[28:54] say you let them out and it supposed to
[28:56] be a mighty God but then I what happened
[28:58] here to destroy the people so God had to
[29:01] change his mind
[29:03] and he was prepared to take Moses and he
[29:05] says by your seed now make a mighty
[29:08] nation than them but Moses said we'll
[29:10] eat to see great so long and then we
[29:14] find when he told these people that go
[29:19] to the man something over there he said
[29:20] all of y'all that moment for those
[29:24] leaders from 20 years and upward all of
[29:29] you are going to die in the wilderness
[29:31] their weapons find out the land for
[29:34] forty days now one day is not before one
[29:38] year for your you're gonna perish in the
[29:41] wilderness for forty years
[29:45] years despite the leg up for
[29:48] every one year is going to be one year
[29:50] for yours
[29:51] he actually came since said to Moses no
[29:54] no we'll go over now when mother said
[29:56] listen yet
[30:00] to read that here let's well say check
[30:07] out is saying unto the children of
[30:08] Israel and the people mourn greatly see
[30:13] that others were killed in the play and
[30:16] the ball did noticing and God is gonna
[30:18] wipe your ass twenty years and over
[30:20] you're not going to go over there's 40
[30:24] and they rose up early in the morning
[30:26] and get them up into the top of the
[30:28] Mount and say no we be air and we'll go
[30:32] up to the place which the Lord had
[30:35] promised for we have sinned and Moses
[30:38] said wherefore now do you tend less the
[30:42] commands of the Lord but it shall not
[30:44] prosper see cannot prosper go not up for
[30:51] the Lord Lord is not among you that
[30:55] should be smitten before your hidden
[30:57] ease verse 43 for the Amalekites and the
[31:02] Canaanites are before you and you shall
[31:06] fall by the sword because you have
[31:09] turned away from the Lord therefore the
[31:11] Lord will not be with you but they
[31:14] presume to go up to the you top
[31:18] nevertheless the act of the Covenant of
[31:20] the Lord and Moses departed not from the
[31:23] camp
[31:24] so this rebellious people still that I
[31:27] cannot now we want to go see but it says
[31:31] we're gonna go there
[31:32] the enemy is gonna make your run it
[31:35] didn't wanna listen this won't want to
[31:37] go was 45 then there many tracks came
[31:40] down and the Canaanites which dwelt in
[31:42] the hills and smoked them and
[31:44] discomforted it
[31:46] even dr. Ouma thanks a lot so we find
[31:49] from that old group here only Joshua and
[31:52] Caleb encouraged and then only David two
[31:55] that were able to go over and then from
[31:59] 2 million people only two maybe over
[32:03] Braves a lot so the bar tells us it's
[32:08] not in the bullet or him
[32:10] God show it mercy all that the father
[32:14] has given me will come amen praise the
[32:16] Lord when God is calling us here bring
[32:19] us his glorious message glorious light
[32:21] of the day you think the people want to
[32:23] come no they find all excuses remember
[32:29] against God they're not family gets a
[32:32] profit the memory gets got right all the
[32:37] evil things are said about mental
[32:40] telepathy you know reading the people's
[32:42] mind and fortune-telling and everything
[32:44] the murmur that gets God and they still
[32:48] want to continue and self God in the
[32:50] denominations there's still want to
[32:53] serve God in the systems but God is
[32:57] taking the new generation with his word
[32:59] the Prophet said this is a further and
[33:01] from Pentecost amen Pentecostal Holy
[33:06] Spirit came like a rushing mighty wind
[33:07] yeah God Himself kid now element
[33:12] fulfilling his word so the variety shall
[33:15] be Claudia and the revelation of the
[33:17] word and then coming down the restaurant
[33:19] said no we can't take it
[33:21] we can't take this word by the world
[33:24] tells us
[33:26] trying to take the book the angel don't
[33:29] take a book and eat amen
[33:31] it was sweet and butis amen we must take
[33:34] a whole book and eat it whether the web
[33:37] is put on my Twitter we must take it and
[33:39] eat it
[33:40] praise Allah so they called murmurs and
[33:44] everything else in and there and God is
[33:46] going to deal with them and smite them
[33:47] amen when they murmur against him
[33:50] the woman came to set in the church she
[33:56] was not this properly
[33:57] how did them is given a coat to come to
[34:00] Jim I don't wanna from what that power
[34:01] that's nice she got angry and went away
[34:05] from the church
[34:08] astronomy preaching it all the time and
[34:11] she went oh she started to die
[34:17] record started coming out of the face
[34:19] the highs got crossed and she said the
[34:23] husband please run and go call that man
[34:27] see please Navin :
[34:30] you know the story he said please come
[34:34] and see a place that's no it's too late
[34:37] chichi she remembered against the Word
[34:40] of God
[34:41] she died miserable day and the thought
[34:45] is yeah gamora if God don't destroy the
[34:51] world because of what happened they then
[34:54] he was raised up Sodom and Gomorrah and
[34:56] apologized to them because how he tell
[35:00] to them you must deal with the whole
[35:01] world you must deal with every
[35:03] individual so if God don't deal with
[35:07] people the way you dealt with this woman
[35:10] that got angry and walked away and said
[35:14] this is what you call religion I won't
[35:16] want it from my pet cow isn't it true if
[35:20] God don't deal with the rest of them you
[35:23] must raise up a phony tax I'm sorry I
[35:25] can't believe the rest of them apologize
[35:27] to you ratio see so every one of them
[35:31] that member and come against is word of
[35:33] God
[35:34] [Music]
[35:35] and the make kisses you know and says we
[35:40] living in a modern age and we would ever
[35:43] write it and we have a right to know
[35:46] this when you want to learn and where
[35:48] our way we want to
[35:50] that's our right but what the Prophet
[35:54] said we must fulfill all our rights
[35:57] surely we have rights we have a right to
[36:01] live abroad tells us we are not of this
[36:04] world
[36:04] we have a right to do whatever we want
[36:07] to but if you are born of the Spirit and
[36:10] through the Holy Spirit we are subject
[36:13] to the holy spring even we don't even
[36:16] belong to ourselves you know the people
[36:19] of this world so boastful of everything
[36:22] but the whole and everything else but
[36:24] the bank says we are purchased position
[36:28] if somebody purchased us we got nothing
[36:31] to lose ourselves amen
[36:34] he purchased us with his own blood he
[36:37] paid the price so he owns us and if he
[36:43] tells us in his word however slow and
[36:46] what we must do we got to be obedient to
[36:49] his word amen otherwise we are not fit
[36:53] to go on the other side praise Allah we
[36:58] got to make an effort and press on and
[37:00] stay with this word Amen so God doesn't
[37:04] want members you get memories yeah you
[37:06] know we don't want this message the
[37:08] message is too hard and this and that
[37:11] and everything else and people will
[37:15] never come to that knowledge of the
[37:16] truth some of it yes right see the world
[37:19] you know what is this and what is that
[37:20] and everything else if it's not the
[37:24] grace of God they will never see see ya
[37:29] in the hole blindness that will continue
[37:32] taking yourself God another one tells us
[37:36] they are heavy learning never able to
[37:39] come to the north
[37:40] the truth ever lemme they go to private
[37:45] school I will college everywhere they
[37:48] learn things but they'll never come to
[37:50] the knowledge of the truth they read the
[37:53] Bible and then leave the Bible we know
[37:57] Christians out there dedicated to read
[38:00] the Bible they got a reading plan they
[38:03] read in the mornings we're gonna read
[38:05] we've got a really plan to read they can
[38:08] read from Genesis to Revelation but you
[38:11] know what it can be ever learning that
[38:14] can be really right but if they don't
[38:16] get a revelation that really doesn't be
[38:19] much they got to get the revelation what
[38:24] is happening people can study the Bible
[38:27] most you could take the fastest around
[38:30] the world denominations everywhere they
[38:32] are reading the Bible yes right you can
[38:35] take a man that put him on an island and
[38:37] give it this Bible you'll read from
[38:40] Genesis to Revelation you can read it
[38:43] but it gotta take the Holy Spirit to
[38:45] quit even work to make that word alive
[38:49] for your day why they really give me
[38:52] other by passing the scriptures either
[38:56] by passive Malik I draw this in the
[38:59] Bible scholar now that's interpreting
[39:01] you know never say wait a senior
[39:03] Medicare for said before the coming of
[39:06] the Great and dreadful day of the rod he
[39:10] voice might be eight of the curse I
[39:11] would say it's so much destructive
[39:14] sentence again this is what's happened
[39:18] so where is the seal and yet even box
[39:23] much the air for the gas and all the
[39:26] other scriptures revelation Ted might
[39:30] the ancient come down amen and then
[39:36] opens up would never say listen yet I'm
[39:39] dubious guys are we eating
[39:41] Phyllis am I sitting at this before the
[39:43] rapture there's going to be a revolution
[39:45] careful for a number say Luke 17 we are
[39:50] seen as it was in the days of
[39:53] Sodom and Gomorrah has he president days
[39:55] Allah the one who's gonna be the second
[39:58] coefficient
[39:59] they say loose again this must happen
[40:01] but why are they reading and all this
[40:04] thing in and also baptism and all they
[40:07] they reading it but they never coming to
[40:09] the knowledge of the truth right now
[40:11] well it must be the quickening power it
[40:15] must be revelation right so we take for
[40:19] example yeah we're calling Saul for now
[40:24] because he wasn't falling I don't know
[40:27] what their what they told me means
[40:30] anybody knows oh we was looking before I
[40:36] became well you were so right so who was
[40:39] so caught by who can you he had the best
[40:47] teacher he taught him in all the Jewish
[40:51] moocher he thought he belong there were
[40:54] a word and everything the Jewish rule
[40:58] kids the Jewish faith and then he was
[41:00] one of the best teachers there so Saul
[41:03] was brought up under him he's a true he
[41:10] had the best teacher yes but he never
[41:14] knew things
[41:15] I'll tell the purifier metric that
[41:20] actually pull off I said not God and I
[41:23] would send you to the Gentiles so said
[41:28] that if it's not them
[41:31] you can talk to them about the best
[41:33] agent and tell them Roxana Crawford and
[41:36] opening the word and everything else and
[41:38] they will they won't listen listen but
[41:42] it must be the oldest people to work in
[41:43] the lives we we want everybody will be
[41:47] safe we want everybody to believe a
[41:49] message you know we get excited when you
[41:52] speak to somebody in and we are wishing
[41:54] that no doubles you know be quickened by
[41:57] something and and then really say you
[41:59] know as Chris
[42:00] but they said that but it must be the
[42:02] Holy Spirit quickly marry a man like
[42:06] Jake said to Peter now who do men say
[42:07] that I am they've gotta have a
[42:11] revelation some say Jeremiah some say
[42:14] you know your eyes and this and that man
[42:17] but Peter who do use it you got that
[42:22] revelation of who he was
[42:24] see so you've got to get that revelation
[42:27] of this message written gonna explain
[42:31] this message to them but they're gonna
[42:34] get the revelation they got to see it's
[42:37] God I'm going to see it's a move of the
[42:40] Holy Spirit they're going to see
[42:42] something different
[42:44] hey Ben we're gonna see Jesus Christ
[42:47] again coming and doing things that
[42:51] preforming but they were that was so far
[42:54] gone
[42:55] they didn't even identify the moving of
[42:57] the Holy Spirit they were so set in
[43:01] their ways and everything else and the
[43:02] parameters are because the same when
[43:04] Jesus came the first time in that here
[43:07] we saw said I'm when the priest was
[43:09] there they were doing the office and
[43:11] they were taking the second fire on
[43:12] behalf of my people or not but when the
[43:14] scriptures were fulfilled for that day
[43:16] they didn't know you are standing right
[43:20] in the midst and if you know all these
[43:23] things yeah cheap the scriptures were
[43:27] there but I let me take Holy Spirit to
[43:30] reveal it amen
[43:34] when the three wise men came they said
[43:37] where is he palm King of the Jews
[43:39] well it works surprise huh as they keep
[43:44] supposed to be born and the College
[43:47] where it says but friend that pity in
[43:48] the Bible I said yeah I know it says he
[43:52] had been here and the wise men went okay
[43:56] dokay
[43:56] don't find it when you find it come back
[43:58] and I also want to worship Him see that
[44:02] was a devil he didn't wanna worship we
[44:05] will not destroy so God call those three
[44:09] wise men after the finish don't go back
[44:11] to her
[44:11] by the way and there it stood when I
[44:15] found out they didn't come he went to
[44:17] kill all the babies two years ago bed
[44:19] all the males say so God will give him
[44:23] the revelation if they don't give in
[44:25] revelation amen
[44:27] so we must pray that God must open the
[44:30] heights
[44:30] amen nomination is that there was ever
[44:33] spiritual sight see not just hearing
[44:38] they're reading the Bible they are all
[44:41] reading a Bible but who is going to
[44:44] reveal to the malachite forum where
[44:49] looks empty
[44:51] who's gonna reveal to them and yet we
[44:54] tell them it is only going to happen if
[45:01] there's a seed gene of God that's going
[45:04] to quicken them that round certainty of
[45:07] accepting like that legally that in a
[45:09] place there will come bursting for out
[45:11] of it why it's gonna be the word that's
[45:14] going to quicken it they know it's not a
[45:16] bit bad that is the revealing this but
[45:18] the Holy Spirit is revealing this word
[45:21] and they're gonna burst out of it praise
[45:24] Allah so the Bible tells us to be ever
[45:26] ready never coming to the knowledge of
[45:28] the truth right now what he says here it
[45:35] was three seven surely the Lord will do
[45:38] nothing but the reveals his secrets
[45:42] three servants see he's not going to do
[45:46] nothing
[45:47] so that's true you must be full foe
[45:50] there should be a profitable and because
[45:54] he's not gonna speak to anybody first he
[45:58] will bring that passage through his
[45:59] prophet first then the must hear that
[46:03] prophet and it's a predestined seed they
[46:08] will hear and what he says in Revelation
[46:10] chapter 3 ye that happen here let him
[46:13] hear what the spirit saith in my respect
[46:18] a man talking in the day
[46:19] it's just full of talking in the day
[46:21] through the men see and what don't be
[46:26] the oldest of great big higher education
[46:29] of learning in and the brothers are
[46:31] pretty tight
[46:32] I wish I could speak like believe them I
[46:35] wish I had a voice like is well they
[46:38] call Roberts you know that you come in
[46:40] and speak and presented know what chose
[46:43] him and in the way that he speaks and
[46:46] everything else
[46:47] atever it's not in the way that they
[46:49] spoke amen
[46:51] you know the voices went out them and
[46:53] really sounded and things know God spoke
[46:56] in a simple way yeah but I believe that
[46:59] word will get to the bride creaking the
[47:01] bride see so people can come for a while
[47:05] and serve God for the one but the one
[47:09] who tells us here right second to me
[47:16] ever learning and never able to come to
[47:19] the knowledge of the truth and the dream
[47:23] that exactly they are ever lemme
[47:28] yes spending all the time they'll never
[47:31] come to the knowledge of the truth and
[47:33] the other scripture tells us it see
[47:39] Hebrews chapter 10 is anybody grows back
[47:46] since so people can't grow up that we're
[47:52] gonna read the scripture that let's go
[47:53] to eBrush up to ten
[47:58] we know that because people went the
[48:00] message there grew back all over the
[48:04] world he walked through the world the
[48:07] rejoice of the work then rejoice want to
[48:10] seize it but they drew back so let's see
[48:14] what the box and about then revelation
[48:17] 10 verse 34 for you at compassion of me
[48:23] by bones said Paul and to joyfully the
[48:27] spoiling of your good knowing in
[48:29] yourselves that you have in heaven a
[48:32] better and an enduring substance cast
[48:35] not away therefore your confidence which
[48:37] has great recompense of reward see cast
[48:42] not away your confidence which a great
[48:45] recompense of reward for you and need of
[48:48] patience then how can you have done the
[48:52] will of God you might receive the
[48:54] promise what of us do first then after
[48:59] you've done the will of God even let me
[49:03] see the promise for yet a little while
[49:06] he that shall come will come and not
[49:11] tarry
[49:12] speaking about the coming of the Lord
[49:14] for yet a little while and need that
[49:17] shall come will come and not tarry now
[49:22] the just shall loop I say but if any man
[49:25] draw back my soul shall have no pleasure
[49:30] in him huh you he's coming but some
[49:39] people wanna draw back and the dead
[49:42] they wanna draw back from blood going to
[49:45] the promise of God we want to draw back
[49:48] now we find fault here we find fall
[49:51] there the prophet said something is
[49:54] wrong the prophet said something there
[49:56] we're gonna draw back I want to go back
[49:59] to Egypt Egypt comes the world Egypt
[50:03] plasma systems
[50:04] I have the order go back we don't want
[50:08] to follow that attached for we don't
[50:11] want to follow the message
[50:12] so if any men project my soul shall have
[50:16] no pleasure in him but we are not of
[50:19] them would draw back unto perdition
[50:22] what is position hell we are not have
[50:26] been the draw back unto perdition who
[50:28] was Judas son of perdition see one of
[50:33] them that believe to the saving of the
[50:35] soul we don't wanna drop back we're
[50:39] gonna press on they're coming up the
[50:41] rock to the saving of the soul see let
[50:44] me say in verse and ER we must be
[50:47] perseverant we must be persistent plays
[50:52] a lot right if if the true revelation of
[50:55] what you have in the word and the Holy
[50:57] Spirit is not keeping you then what is
[50:59] keeping you how are you going to
[51:02] continue amen we know we ever promise we
[51:08] know this is a Word of God and when we
[51:11] love their last days are yeah see
[51:15] remember that case upon us the condition
[51:20] of the world is sitting there getting
[51:21] just right for the rapture
[51:25] see men are heady highminded lovers of
[51:27] pleasure more than lovers of God false
[51:31] accusers trucebreakers incontinent fears
[51:34] this is then the world is like that
[51:41] there's no place you can go
[51:44] you know once even in our country when
[51:48] things were looking good yeah especially
[51:51] with this uh all the chaos you know
[51:56] country people were fleeing you could
[51:59] write to us pray New Zealand the world
[52:04] knows I'm going to go back where were
[52:06] places where there's no fear and the
[52:10] safety for the children
[52:12] and obviously but now there's no place
[52:16] all this places that I want to go to a
[52:19] place is a problem you know in the
[52:22] private preaching Chicago
[52:24] another place he spoke in Chicago that
[52:27] the gospel must go and people must
[52:29] receive the Word of God Francis today
[52:32] Chicago is one of the highest murder
[52:35] states in the world the highest murder
[52:40] people are murdering I don't know how
[52:43] many hundreds of thousands of people are
[52:45] defended in Chicago even the same is
[52:49] happening United States Tucson where the
[52:54] fire came down well the prophet got the
[52:57] Commission seven angels can go through
[53:01] the seal but Tucson in the news there's
[53:04] uprising and writing and everything
[53:06] there they can't control them
[53:09] yeah and the Prophet when the Lord sent
[53:13] me there there was like desert place
[53:16] cactus and he's talking about once when
[53:21] they're ready instead over here the
[53:24] place was so peaceful and you can yeah
[53:28] disability but it says now it's a place
[53:32] of where the growth is casinos gambling
[53:37] dens and the cities are so you know
[53:41] Goethe and then and become the biggest
[53:44] cities over there now Tucson Arizona
[53:49] full of mighty they don't know what to
[53:54] do in the place called on the west coast
[53:59] a border in Canada and America Seattle
[54:05] they corner again and the brunt says job
[54:09] if you're God said and stop this
[54:11] violence I'm gonna send the bill three
[54:13] other lady the lady government and what
[54:16] she says we are gonna come back your
[54:19] military you can try and send your
[54:22] military going to combat them can you
[54:25] believe that the president said you can
[54:30] stop them for lighting and burning up
[54:32] the places at all you're fully Center
[54:35] give up send your military we're gonna
[54:38] combat them chaos what and also once all
[54:46] these places aware that God was preached
[54:49] and we feel sorry for the believers
[54:52] there clover their battle as good
[54:55] believers in Seattle they just cross
[54:57] over the border there and the good
[54:59] church over there also they gotta preach
[55:00] it off
[55:01] but now all this chaos and violence and
[55:03] all you know the movements are
[55:05] restricted Branson the old world has got
[55:09] to the stage but the bride is looking
[55:14] she's looking at all what's taking place
[55:18] listening to the news and that people
[55:21] don't know what's happening they want an
[55:27] answer see as much as advance they are
[55:35] scientists can't come to the rescue
[55:37] right now scientists are personnel
[55:41] aboard asleep trying to find a vaccine
[55:44] which is an immune system only to pull
[55:49] your immune system and when you get that
[55:52] virus your body must be able to handle
[55:54] it and they can't kill that because
[55:57] there's no life in it ourselves is what
[56:02] they need they're gonna get into
[56:06] ourselves and then they multiply and
[56:09] reproduce and damage our organs the
[56:13] lungs and then stop top top news that
[56:20] this was from the laboratory it is a
[56:24] biological thing that is introduced this
[56:29] proof so it's not something that just
[56:33] started from animal and I reckon they've
[56:36] done that than the research and all the
[56:39] way that it sticks to human beings when
[56:43] it gets into them it doesn't stick to
[56:45] the animal like that
[56:48] it sticks like that like a tick you
[56:50] don't click on the goal that invites
[56:53] into the skin over there you can't get
[56:55] it out they're going to try to put a
[56:58] tick over there it's holding so much
[57:01] you'll pull there it's still in the skin
[57:04] so as it can stick more on the human get
[57:09] into your lungs and your throat and
[57:10] everything but it don't stick like that
[57:13] pamphlet anymore
[57:15] there maybe like that science is very
[57:19] advanced but before I got to take any
[57:25] weight there are some believers around
[57:28] the world got infected with these things
[57:31] especially there in England some
[57:35] believers from zubaba working over there
[57:37] and we got used some of them have got
[57:39] the virus and things like that so pray
[57:41] God will make me wait for them even
[57:42] other parts of the world so it's a it's
[57:46] something because I look at now and ask
[57:48] God know what is happening now our
[57:52] province here there was hardly any cases
[57:55] now you know that way it was slow and
[57:58] how do you meet somebody that's been
[58:00] traveling out but I believe you're
[58:03] supposed to be at the Caleb in Joshua's
[58:08] teacher one of the guide the husband
[58:15] that the teacher is infected huh so we
[58:19] gonna find that now how come all of a
[58:21] sudden these people got the virus from
[58:23] where because you're gonna have a trace
[58:26] of it not happening with a few people
[58:30] but all of a sudden is cool about it is
[58:35] it it sounds very scary so you don't
[58:39] know where so there they are warning us
[58:42] don't go to the supermarket don't go yet
[58:44] don't go there because you don't know
[58:46] who's got it sick somebody can just have
[58:51] it there and that's the reason the
[58:55] clothes done all the mushrooms are now
[58:56] somebody can prepare your food is sneeze
[58:58] over there at the Romney people
[59:02] people speech then if they don't know
[59:04] because they're cooking in the back
[59:06] there they don't know you think Dean
[59:11] fall on the floor they take it and throw
[59:13] it away no they take it put it back in
[59:14] the pot that's right that we didn't
[59:21] UNICEF and the brain researchers study
[59:24] the gluttonous undercover guys they're
[59:26] the fondest people they're not even
[59:28] washing the heads preparing the meal
[59:31] thank you see they're wiping the nose so
[59:36] you find that your food is a little bit
[59:38] tastier so grandchildren they don't know
[59:45] where this is and they're trying to
[59:48] prove it but the people are protesting
[59:50] oh we want that we weren't there she
[59:53] beat you open we want the bottle store
[59:55] to open
[59:56] you know we want to have we want
[59:58] cigarettes open the places so we don't
[1:00:08] know what to do so we just beat this
[1:00:11] classic a lot done that you just keep us
[1:00:13] by its grace
[1:00:14] so what is this all the see coming up on
[1:00:17] the earth and one time the world had an
[1:00:21] opportunity to hear the gospel together
[1:00:25] the message and if they reject this word
[1:00:28] they got to pay for it so you're gonna
[1:00:32] find out all these places the Prophet
[1:00:34] wrote in Greek so you can trace those
[1:00:36] places are become terrible cynic I'm
[1:00:39] Governor Bob there's no control see
[1:00:45] so we pray the Holy Spirit come and
[1:00:48] catch his bride and take them away but
[1:00:50] in the woods our fathers some people
[1:00:52] what a drawback and the only drawback
[1:00:55] when all the fault again trying to go to
[1:00:59] scrutinize the life of the Prophet and
[1:01:02] find out why he gave wrong dates with
[1:01:04] this at wrong begs for that so that's an
[1:01:06] excuse of the drawback but if you see
[1:01:09] the moving of the working of the Holy
[1:01:11] Spirit we wish it brother
[1:01:14] we're not drunk back yes we know that
[1:01:16] the problem spoke alive you would have
[1:01:19] not moved at all because you know one
[1:01:22] time when he said to the government
[1:01:23] authorities that were under you for the
[1:01:25] Texas he said too so I tell them I'm not
[1:01:27] here and God won't eat a baby that will
[1:01:31] see you have to go make that land and
[1:01:34] confess it right so you throw so many
[1:01:38] other lies right God would the who gave
[1:01:40] His life so yeah go and confess it right
[1:01:44] so people wanna drop it we wonder what
[1:01:48] revelation they had now how can they
[1:01:52] have the revelation how can the rejoice
[1:01:55] for a while how can they be there were
[1:01:58] there were partakers of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:01] there was singing and praising God and
[1:02:03] everything else what happened go to
[1:02:09] Hebrews chapter 6 now Hebrews chapter 6
[1:02:15] is one of their scriptures here the
[1:02:18] prophet in his early days where the
[1:02:22] witness somebody speak with tongues and
[1:02:24] somebody interpret and by the gift of
[1:02:27] God that he had he was able to find that
[1:02:29] one was the genuine Christian one was
[1:02:32] the sinner living in adultery and that
[1:02:35] trouble is mine because they're all
[1:02:38] there in the chair to rejoin see but
[1:02:40] this one guy was living in adultery but
[1:02:44] so he got trouble he went with them in
[1:02:47] the wilderness he said I'm gonna wait
[1:02:49] upon the Lord I'm confused about this
[1:02:50] and this is one school - yeah the Holy
[1:02:54] Spirit blew open amen the Prophet had
[1:03:01] the Bible closed but the wind came and
[1:03:04] blew it here to Hebrews chapter 6 see
[1:03:11] first four we can read for it is
[1:03:15] impossible for those who were once
[1:03:20] enlightened impossible
[1:03:27] for those who are once enlightened and
[1:03:31] have tasted of the heavenly gift Oh
[1:03:37] the taster and we made partakers of the
[1:03:41] Holy Ghost can it ever be broke here
[1:03:47] were made partakers of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:49] and tasted the good word of God and that
[1:03:56] was only the message the good word of
[1:03:59] God and the powers of the world to come
[1:04:06] why cry speak the Prophet aunty five
[1:04:13] times he was able to speak and things
[1:04:17] happen powers of the world to come the
[1:04:21] tadpole if they shall fall away okay if
[1:04:27] they shall fall away thank you the power
[1:04:34] of God
[1:04:37] if they shall fall away to reduce and
[1:04:41] put him to an open shame see this is
[1:04:48] where it's good to have been to the
[1:04:51] profit mode for that for the head would
[1:04:53] you drink it in the rain
[1:04:55] they're coming off upon it and bring it
[1:04:58] forth herbs meat for them to me this
[1:05:00] dress this Seema the blessing from God
[1:05:04] but that which well Tom's and Prius is
[1:05:07] rejected and is not at the cursing was
[1:05:11] hellish to be burned what he said he
[1:05:14] falls on the just as a gesture but the
[1:05:18] real predestined writers I'm not going
[1:05:21] to be like these people just gonna be
[1:05:24] partakers that rejoice for a while and
[1:05:26] everything else no praise Allah
[1:05:31] they say but that which well Tom's and
[1:05:35] breezes and things that accompany
[1:05:38] salvation the only that speak so there's
[1:05:43] something will pull back how many people
[1:05:46] that pull away many people through back
[1:05:51] back to the old way of living the first
[1:05:56] signs when you see somebody leave the
[1:05:58] true Word of God the first signs of
[1:06:01] unbelief the dressing change though they
[1:06:07] become worldly and I want to still say
[1:06:11] today you can still see that distinct
[1:06:13] difference between a message believe
[1:06:15] addressing and the worldliness people
[1:06:18] and some of it that blessing change the
[1:06:22] sketch become shorter shorter tender
[1:06:28] stop putting all these things
[1:06:29] Ostara
[1:06:33] they suspect hyperosmotic see let me not
[1:06:43] get on like a hybrid you can go by pet
[1:06:47] and you can put your but when you
[1:06:55] believe it
[1:06:56] they left the word the word and the
[1:07:01] message but keep keeping them in line
[1:07:04] but they pull back you know I'll see the
[1:07:09] sister a very long time we seen at the
[1:07:12] funeral she used to fellowship with us
[1:07:13] too she and her family then some little
[1:07:18] something to have they left to went to
[1:07:20] another church and they left jet jet
[1:07:23] went to another church and they
[1:07:25] basically now they're not going to any
[1:07:27] church at all and I got problem that we
[1:07:31] seen the sister and the funeral well
[1:07:33] it's wearing slacks was once coming to
[1:07:37] the message that bless properly like
[1:07:38] every basic believe it off wearing
[1:07:41] slacks and the a is got chopped the wife
[1:07:46] and I were there the day when we see
[1:07:48] that the leave the world and they think
[1:07:53] the only way not to become worthy and to
[1:07:57] make it even worse they gone home pick
[1:08:03] one one and I want a dress for their for
[1:08:05] their slacks so I must believe the word
[1:08:14] leave a message the first thing about
[1:08:16] scum like that it shows what spirit is
[1:08:22] motivating them he's controlling them
[1:08:29] they're taking the blood of Jesus
[1:08:31] cutters they can't come back they put
[1:08:35] him to an open shame so without me ten
[1:08:40] bucks for this message I would have
[1:08:43] Gordon and out his early days he met his
[1:08:47] wife and things like that and she was
[1:08:49] going to be a missionary going to Tibet
[1:08:52] Dave Asia and the mountain Himalayan
[1:08:56] mountains and a mother father were
[1:08:59] missionaries in in Japan and things like
[1:09:02] that and she want to be a we shouldn't
[1:09:05] go there but she met Billy Graham and
[1:09:08] they've got many then all after that and
[1:09:11] I was looking at some pictures they and
[1:09:13] all the same you know as much as he was
[1:09:17] a phosphor preacher and ready preach the
[1:09:20] message also someday cities are picked
[1:09:22] up their your speech preach against
[1:09:26] denominations and churches like has a
[1:09:28] problem
[1:09:31] he chopped his wife now she's got very
[1:09:33] home because lips and now she's giving
[1:09:38] her testimony how wrong God was gonna
[1:09:40] use that and send it to Tibet and all
[1:09:42] this thing and then you know just let me
[1:09:44] look at pictures of people and tell us
[1:09:46] what spirit is there then I thought of
[1:09:49] the prophets if you look at the profit
[1:09:52] of each of you maybe his wife totally
[1:09:55] different number all this makeup and and
[1:10:02] walked in and dressing you know she was
[1:10:05] a super humble how to learn and I
[1:10:11] recommended his wife spoke very highly
[1:10:15] of her
[1:10:17] see so there is a wariness that people
[1:10:21] get into the corrective at the truth
[1:10:25] right I gotta deny the word to get into
[1:10:28] their and their enemies not there they
[1:10:33] got to come to the judgment and the
[1:10:36] prophet said everything would play out
[1:10:38] down the street
[1:10:41] the type of clothing that we were the
[1:10:45] things that we had interested but places
[1:10:48] we went to explain anything it just be
[1:10:54] plain you wanna see you don't know what
[1:10:57] funny judgment is not be pronounced
[1:11:03] everything that promises even every word
[1:11:08] we attack it continues in the airways
[1:11:13] we were just yell if anything it's
[1:11:16] forgotten
[1:11:17] it's continuing in their ways and they
[1:11:21] said everything to be there every word
[1:11:24] that we have to draw with everything
[1:11:25] else see the Bible talks about a
[1:11:30] conversation is everything what manner
[1:11:33] of people we have to be raised alone so
[1:11:38] remember now there's going to be a
[1:11:40] people on the face of the earth although
[1:11:43] we are not perfect
[1:11:44] ourselves we are still human right we
[1:11:48] are subject to failure failure we are
[1:11:51] subject to false thanks a lot
[1:11:58] Texan normal human living conditions
[1:12:05] isn't it I mean you know what Frances I
[1:12:11] mean if you have white going to bed the
[1:12:12] Kami all the time you cannot comment
[1:12:16] down okay you tell such a lovely cook
[1:12:23] you are enjoying your food everyday
[1:12:28] nothing the Muslim white a buzz word
[1:12:31] that she was wrong ago a little thing
[1:12:35] can upset American say no universe
[1:12:39] you'll never make my sandwich nice let's
[1:12:41] let's go quickly end and spring Gordon
[1:12:44] speech a little bit more to us enough so
[1:12:47] who are we today so we like everybody
[1:12:51] else we are human we have Falls we have
[1:12:53] failures and everything else but were
[1:12:56] they just full of big eNOS amen as much
[1:13:03] as we are the outside natural takes a
[1:13:05] spirit be there's a spirit man inside
[1:13:08] brother box in the output method is day
[1:13:11] by day but the inward man should be
[1:13:15] revealed right so now who are we really
[1:13:19] so the problem now he went to a
[1:13:24] laboratory with one of the brothers then
[1:13:26] and they took him to the laboratory
[1:13:28] where they had all the test tubes and
[1:13:31] everything else and if someone to test
[1:13:34] you how baby calves are born and when
[1:13:44] they look at this fish poop to put their
[1:13:46] micro microscope or whatever it is there
[1:13:49] on the glass and the foot was there and
[1:13:51] he looked through that and he saw
[1:13:53] millions of life millions of life and it
[1:14:01] looked at me speak to the brother he
[1:14:03] says you know what he's dead from one
[1:14:04] you know like one good-looking yeah he
[1:14:07] says it must be about a million life
[1:14:08] over there he said yes
[1:14:12] million the other one he says here if
[1:14:18] you'd watch the natural birth it's more
[1:14:22] of a mystery than the virgin birth but
[1:14:27] surah I mean the virgin birth Christ was
[1:14:31] prophesied already the virgin shall
[1:14:35] conceive a man
[1:14:38] that angel games and you shall call his
[1:14:40] name Jesus right that was what the
[1:14:46] supernatural right
[1:14:51] but the natural birth from over a
[1:14:54] million living Joe laughs Joe only one
[1:15:00] will come to life
[1:15:04] the rest of it must die in Finnish say
[1:15:09] so themself is the natural birth is more
[1:15:14] because only one comes to life
[1:15:19] horn we had put others and sisters but
[1:15:24] they all at the finish you came to life
[1:15:28] now the Prophet tells us something
[1:15:32] blinded you and your life so we look to
[1:15:38] by chance you had to be tired
[1:15:43] furthermore your image stops you are
[1:15:47] predestinated and he says in the
[1:15:51] beginning all the seats will lend you
[1:15:53] the drama it has to take the life of the
[1:15:56] subtle psychic to bring it to life but
[1:16:00] and because this firm there's one in
[1:16:05] there that's predestinated to live and
[1:16:07] the rest of the die and it isn't the
[1:16:11] first one beats it's a first one that
[1:16:15] comes together with a hey maybe the egg
[1:16:19] may rise up from the back of his firm or
[1:16:22] the middle of the spoon the germ they do
[1:16:27] the same they hang the germ crawls into
[1:16:31] the hay and little tails drop off of it
[1:16:36] and there starts the spine there's only
[1:16:41] one in that whole load of million that's
[1:16:44] going to make it only one and that's
[1:16:52] determined by some unknown force men get
[1:16:56] there everyone alike every one of those
[1:17:00] jumps I just like same thing in animals
[1:17:05] same thing in men it's determined
[1:17:09] whether it's going to be a boy or a girl
[1:17:11] Levin black in it or what it's
[1:17:15] determined by God like God said to
[1:17:19] Jeremiah before you were swamped with
[1:17:20] your mother's womb I knew you
[1:17:22] I knew everything about your maker and
[1:17:24] God was preparing it to be a prophet you
[1:17:28] can't be nothing else see so I'll be
[1:17:32] planned to come here
[1:17:33] I will predestinated then when God saw
[1:17:37] his own worth in their own world with
[1:17:39] that in the chaos with the teachings and
[1:17:42] you know his word and everything then is
[1:17:45] raised up yet
[1:17:46] there's no sucker believe is worth the
[1:17:49] predestinated ones see only after Paul
[1:17:53] went and studied for three years then he
[1:17:56] got the revelation to preach about
[1:17:58] predestination even myself
[1:18:02] he was predestined see he's speaking
[1:18:06] about predestination he's speaking about
[1:18:09] the foreknowledge of God see before that
[1:18:13] all these people are coming and then
[1:18:15] they you know coming take the people
[1:18:17] away from our faith the fearing or a
[1:18:20] Jewish faith but in that would be
[1:18:24] revealing what Danny is living in and
[1:18:26] what is happening yet me everyone alike
[1:18:36] okay it's determined by God
[1:18:40] but there's one in there that's ordained
[1:18:43] to
[1:18:45] in a million yet all of them are like
[1:18:50] when Israel left Egypt there was
[1:18:53] approximately 2 million people left at
[1:18:55] the same time every one of them had the
[1:18:58] message of the Prophet every one of them
[1:19:01] saw the pillar of fire every one of them
[1:19:04] was baptized to Moses in the Red Sea and
[1:19:07] one of them shouted in the spirit feed
[1:19:10] the tampering ran up around the banquet
[1:19:13] William when Moses sang in the spirit
[1:19:15] all of them did that everyone drank from
[1:19:20] the same spiritual rock they were there
[1:19:24] everyone he freshman at every night any
[1:19:28] one of them but there was two made the
[1:19:33] lame one out of a million
[1:19:38] what was the risk what was a test they
[1:19:42] all drank the same Rock they all need
[1:19:45] the same spiritual manner that we are
[1:19:47] eating this morning but the word test
[1:19:50] proved them ah the word test they were
[1:19:55] not able to believe God was able to do
[1:19:58] you think God telling them go over there
[1:20:02] I'm giving you the land and God no these
[1:20:04] giant Sunday
[1:20:05] God was not able to fight the battle for
[1:20:08] them right he did it from judgment
[1:20:11] killer family wins but I was dominated
[1:20:16] see they're going to get the word test
[1:20:19] when it comes to the time of Kennish
[1:20:23] Ponyo when they started over in the
[1:20:25] promised land
[1:20:26] and they could not go over to there was
[1:20:33] tested by the world and the other team
[1:20:37] can make said we can't make it we're
[1:20:40] like grasshoppers to them the great
[1:20:42] varsity their opposition's to great but
[1:20:47] judgment came up stronger people they
[1:20:50] said we are more than able to do it why
[1:20:53] God said before they left the promised
[1:20:55] and given you the land and give it to
[1:20:58] you it's yours and then wear one I don't
[1:21:02] teach believe so blood sisters how we
[1:21:05] got a pretty shot I were going to stay
[1:21:08] faithful to the Word of God and say what
[1:21:12] God all things are possible with God all
[1:21:19] things are possible right so there's
[1:21:26] nothing nothing to watch with a lot I
[1:21:28] mean he created the heavens and the
[1:21:30] earth he spoke things into existence
[1:21:36] when Moses was standing before Pharaoh
[1:21:39] he asked Moses Troy a rock down already
[1:21:43] sure it will tend to seventh God can
[1:21:46] make a rock ten to seven God can speak
[1:21:53] to a donkey and tell Balaam you know
[1:21:56] what you shouldn't go huh a donkey
[1:22:03] donkey and the Balaam was so much out of
[1:22:06] his senses big stuff at the end yeah you
[1:22:09] talk to you know you couldn't you're
[1:22:12] talking with a donkey huh so what I plan
[1:22:19] to show who are we the message I'm gonna
[1:22:22] set block for that short one and then
[1:22:24] run away
[1:22:25] whoa what the word says we are there's
[1:22:30] approximately 500 million so-called
[1:22:33] Christians in the world today again that
[1:22:34] was in this generation and each day ends
[1:22:37] in separation and now what if the
[1:22:41] rapture will come today and 500 people
[1:22:44] universally would be taken in the
[1:22:46] rapture
[1:22:47] so I think today there's about 2 billion
[1:22:49] Christians in the world right all over
[1:22:53] to believe and I think 2 billion Muslims
[1:22:58] also so they're not to take place you
[1:23:04] never know
[1:23:07] or even see
[1:23:08] let's see in the paper of them going and
[1:23:12] the coming of the lawn is the secret
[1:23:14] coming he said it's gonna happen so
[1:23:19] quickly the twinkling of an eye so who's
[1:23:25] gonna be this one's gonna go in the
[1:23:26] rapture you think God is gonna take it
[1:23:31] choose that y'all will choose yes we all
[1:23:37] that God prepared my speed when I come
[1:23:41] back I'm going to receive you
[1:23:43] he's going to prepare at the office
[1:23:48] they already prepared you take a
[1:23:58] youngster want to marry one girl you
[1:23:59] know okay the guy I mean haven't got a
[1:24:03] house yet we were like that we'll be
[1:24:07] young marry the girl take mother's ups
[1:24:13] dead mother's house date should be
[1:24:15] finished be able to have a job but know
[1:24:23] you're able to support your wife your
[1:24:26] parents got it enough today they don't
[1:24:28] you're worsening that you already
[1:24:41] prepared a place for us
[1:24:43] see we're not going to pick up there
[1:24:46] that said oh you know okay you got a
[1:24:48] quickie he is already gone to prepare a
[1:24:53] place and he said when I come back I'm
[1:24:57] gonna save you
[1:24:58] right so young people not get that mic
[1:25:04] set now I'm just gonna get bed those
[1:25:07] things over honestly
[1:25:08] Meatwad sir cranberry Mother's us after
[1:25:14] things didn't work out
[1:25:15] the mother completely is that if you
[1:25:19] recall we were go so make sure to get
[1:25:29] through but getting married to must make
[1:25:34] sure that I can support you
[1:25:37] yeah you find the house I'm fortunate I
[1:25:49] got a hot body okay so what is it he
[1:26:02] will come and steal away he will come
[1:26:07] and steal away he will be such a
[1:26:10] minority to just like it was in the days
[1:26:14] when the disciples asked Jesus why does
[1:26:17] the scribe cycle is was first come he
[1:26:20] said he's already come and you never
[1:26:22] knew it did you ever think what the
[1:26:26] people did the winter right on believing
[1:26:29] that he lies was coming and he was right
[1:26:32] amongst them and they didn't know it so
[1:26:35] will it be in the coming of the Son of
[1:26:38] Man they will do with him just the same
[1:26:41] thing the Spirit of God is here well
[1:26:45] what are you going to do with it
[1:26:47] are you going to eat manna and so forth
[1:26:50] and not condemn me move up as we grow
[1:26:54] did you ever notice the sea
[1:26:57] as a level interpreter speaking a few
[1:26:59] moments ago and how a seed goes into the
[1:27:03] ground many seeds are in the ground and
[1:27:07] then when God moved up on the water with
[1:27:10] the light it's light
[1:27:15] and what the waters went back the seed
[1:27:18] and that's why they equate to the mood
[1:27:20] and want to go to Mars at all to see if
[1:27:23] there's water there once they got water
[1:27:27] they know they can plant seeds they need
[1:27:32] water there's no problem they got
[1:27:35] sunlight the Sun striking day but they
[1:27:39] need water but so the water was have to
[1:27:43] see to grow so God has done all this had
[1:27:48] prepared for us okay your body was
[1:27:55] laying there right on the earth when
[1:27:57] God's has brought their people existence
[1:28:00] we are part of the earth
[1:28:03] we were living there and by his
[1:28:07] foreknowledge he knew exactly who would
[1:28:11] love it and who would serve it and who
[1:28:15] would not see loving him and serving him
[1:28:19] he's taking he taking his word all the
[1:28:22] way not to them drawing back he knows
[1:28:26] who love me when seven so that's why we
[1:28:31] love and certainly been the message and
[1:28:33] he's talking about a redtail we love him
[1:28:37] and be serving it we should believe the
[1:28:40] message where the last one standing if
[1:28:44] God is gonna work on his previous method
[1:28:47] method let all go all ten away we must
[1:28:50] be able to say Lord I'll be standing his
[1:28:55] foreknowledge tells them if he doesn't
[1:28:58] then he's of God he can't be God without
[1:29:02] the incident and if he's infinite he
[1:29:06] knows all things from you she's very
[1:29:10] good in you so you see people making the
[1:29:12] blunders people making the blunders they
[1:29:18] stimulated they learn at him and they
[1:29:22] think this and death but it doesn't work
[1:29:25] right we see it
[1:29:28] but there is a working right that's to
[1:29:31] find God's perfect world and stand in it
[1:29:34] what God called for you is a types in
[1:29:38] the Bible that we could see what
[1:29:40] happened there
[1:29:41] though the Old Testament that had what's
[1:29:44] going to happen in God down to the
[1:29:48] millisecond certain way he's going to do
[1:29:50] the same thing
[1:29:52] millions of the world 2 billion how many
[1:29:57] of their bought into life okay not yet
[1:30:01] jumps off to regroup see never right so
[1:30:05] the bride you saw then that came up
[1:30:09] through the Great Tribulation so their
[1:30:11] people will come up in the Great
[1:30:12] Tribulation
[1:30:13] they demand the chance of the web they
[1:30:16] will die for the faith they left it go
[1:30:18] to persecution or the Antichrist and
[1:30:20] everything else and they will die for
[1:30:22] the faint like in the early ages they'll
[1:30:26] be killed John saw bedroom and then he
[1:30:30] saw they happen to 44,000 of the Jews so
[1:30:36] the bride is there and the brightest
[1:30:39] part of him
[1:30:40] the Bible of the world won't tell us
[1:30:42] anything about anybody else being part
[1:30:45] of the bride and following the land only
[1:30:49] the brian has these potentials only she
[1:30:53] is part of him because she's part of in
[1:30:56] the world and the world came today right
[1:30:59] see so rude and we translate we ought to
[1:31:05] appreciate God really appreciate it I'll
[1:31:11] closer this one Katya
[1:31:12] now the Prophet also says somebody that
[1:31:15] did a good deed to you being the bride
[1:31:19] they will receive salvation can you
[1:31:23] believe that maybe they are not
[1:31:26] expecting it at least expect it but
[1:31:29] because you're the bride how important
[1:31:32] that is and they cannot receive
[1:31:35] salvation then if you turn that around
[1:31:40] if somebody does just despite to the
[1:31:43] bride what's gonna happen to this is it
[1:31:50] going to be blessed by Greek something
[1:31:52] for the bride
[1:31:52] and if they tell me get surprised you
[1:31:58] can think about that but God is going to
[1:32:01] deal with them too because you're the
[1:32:03] bride he said let the millstone be
[1:32:06] hanging around the neck round even if
[1:32:11] somebody comes and gets a child of God
[1:32:14] so this thank God we may be the few in
[1:32:20] number the bride if you talking gently
[1:32:23] around the world few in number but I
[1:32:27] pray now God has really revealed it to a
[1:32:30] hearty young people also God is
[1:32:34] revealing
[1:32:36] pray that God would make a way to you
[1:32:38] lot of young people after they came for
[1:32:41] their you know knowledge get
[1:32:46] knowledgeable and they could read
[1:32:49] something up don't know what the reason
[1:32:52] about the place if not that's gonna go
[1:32:55] see part of it but God has called you
[1:32:59] for a purpose God has predestinated us
[1:33:01] and that is where our fate to be anger
[1:33:05] pleasure our freedom or bliss
