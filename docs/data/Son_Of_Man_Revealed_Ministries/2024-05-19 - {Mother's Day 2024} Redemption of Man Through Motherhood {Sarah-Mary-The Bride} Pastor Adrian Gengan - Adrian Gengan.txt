commemorate mothers amen amen so we like to wish every mom a Happy Mother's Day a Blessed Mother's Day to you and also remembering amen the moms who have passed from this life and have gone over to the other dimension that are waiting patiently amen waiting patiently for the living Saints to come to Perfection am amen because when we come to Perfection amen it's got to empty out that sixth Dimension amen amen so we want to remember them amen even faithful moms that were here in the church that have gone on to be with the Lord amen we remember them fondly in our hearts and we look forward to seeing them again and I know some some of us have not seen them in the Brilliance of the youth we may remember them as older woman of Faith but amen when we see them again they shall be in the Brilliance of the youth so so we treasure mom we value moms amen and we want to express our love to all moms this morning especially Godly moms who love us unconditionally and sacrifice so much for us amen amen uh let's give all our moms a good hand clap and say a job well done you're doing a good job amen hallelujah they take care of us they cook for us clean for us amen they nurture us teach us God's word correct us when we are wrong amen and they know how to correct you Hallelujah but moms are our biggest supporters amen amen moms our biggest supporters they always rooting for their children amen always backing their children want to see their children succeed in life amen and whether it's home life school life work life your family life amen they want the best for their children and and you know that's an attribute of God mother that that nature of a mother is an attribute of God amen amen so God put his attribute in them so they they could love us unconditionally they know not a lot not a lot of people will love you in this life but there's one person guaranteed to love you is your mother in this life now I know God loves you unconditionally but I'm showing you his attribute I know some of you are loved by everybody but there's one person who will love you forever it's your mother no amens on that yes amen so we we pray for our moms if you pray for your moms we want to pray for our moms this morning and pray that the Lord will greatly reward their efforts amen abundantly bless them with good health long life until he comes amen and you know may they always be surrounding with loving children loving grandchildren and a good life as they continue to serve the Lord God Almighty our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so we really want to pass our blessings on to mothers this morning amen so let's turn to our Bibles Hallelujah we turn to Proverbs chapter 31 I've got two portions of a message one addressing mom's and then we'll get into the real meat of the message or the heart of the message amen just to encourage you this morning Hallelujah we serve a awesome God we serve a good God so we can come this morning and worship him in spirit and in truth amen there's no other place we can find Refuge or strength but it's in the presence of the Lord amen so Psalms 31 let's read from verse 25 amen it says strength and honor are a clothing she is confident about the future her mouth is full of wisdom kindly teaching is on her tongue she's Vigilant over the activities of her household and she doesn't eat the food of laziness she opens her mouth with wisdom and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue her children rise up and call her blessed a husband also and he Praises her many women have done excellently but you surpass them all verse 31 it says honor her for all that her hands have done and let her Works bring her praise at The City Gate amen the Lord have bless listen to the reading of his word you may be seated in Isaiah 66 and3 it says as a mother Comforts a child so will I that's God Almighty comfort you amen so we know amen he will never leave us comfortless now there's many things in this life to get sad depressed about Amen in this life and we need comfort amen and God is showing us that his attribute of motherhood amen like a mother's love towards us he himself is is coming to comfort us amen amen so when you're feeling down when you're feeling weary in this life and you feel like you got nowhere to turn to I encourage you to turn to the word of God amen amen I encourage you to turn to prayer amen because there's not many people as mothers that you can turn to yes amen and especially when you have younger children for those that have got older children maybe it's not so difficult but when you have really young children amen some sometimes it feels like the walls are closing in on you and you're getting all the pressure amen and you wonder how you going to make it amen so turn to Jesus quote scriptures I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength amen his strength is perfect when I am weak amen hallelujah now in Psalm 139 133 and 14 it says for you form my inward Parts un knitted me together in my mother's Wom now watch David how he's bringing this out he's not saying that my father and my mother came together and it was just a natural scientific process he's attributing this conception to God yes and he's saying you formed my inward Parts you knitted me together in my mother's home amen I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made amen amen every one of us is fearfully and wonderfully made you know SC people who believe in science and these atheists they believe that everything came out of nothing but yet when they're doing studies they want to prove that something came by intelligent design they know that even this computer couldn't have come by nothing there had to be an intelligent mind behind this computer that would think about it and design it amen and if you look at how complex the human body is there had to be an intelligent designer behind it amen thank you Lord L amen hallelujah wonderful are your works so don't ever feel discouraged you know that you are fearfully and wonderfully made amen no matter what people tell you in this life how they attack you and say words against you try to belittle you and tear down your character tear down your spirit you know that you are fearfully and wonderfully made amen especially young people they get bullied at school amen they told they are ugly they told amen they are fat and they told any kind of things to try and crush the human Spirit but you are fearfully and wonderfully made amen wonderful are your Works my soul knows it very well amen so here when we when we go to 2 Timothy 1 and5 the Apostle Paul is telling Timothy here when I look at you my young man I recognize something within you you you have a faith within you and I've seen this Faith before I've seen this faith that was first in your [Music] grandmother and then in your mother Unice your grandmother was Lois your mother is unus but I persuaded that in thee also so faith can be passed down through generations how through teaching amen mom is a fth gospel and it's our role and a duty Beauty because the first four years are given to her before you handle over to the school teacher or him to the school teacher the first four years are the training ground where you have with the child amen those are sacred times because that will be the foundational teachings of the child so I encourage you before you hand them over to the school teacher make sure they are taught the word of God make sure they are singing Sunday school songs make sure they have scripture Memory verses amen teach them the ways of God Amen then what will happen the Bible says train them up in the ways they should go for when they grow older they will not depart from the faith amen amen and that's how generational Faith was passed down yes the faith was so strong in Grandma Lois yes that she taught her daughter Unice yes and Unice raised the son Timothy with the faith amen amen hallelujah and that word UNF faith means a perfect faith I see it in you Timothy amen hallelujah so don't think that you teaching your children is of no effect amen it's having an effect on them thank you Lord amen hallelujah and and never think your children are too old to correct them amen always take them back to the word of God Amen because people can stray but always directing back to the word of God God Amen and the work of moms have a work to do older women if you go to Titus 2 and 3 you'll see within the home within the church life within the home life they have a specific role it says the aged women likewise that they be in Behavior as becometh Holiness not false accuses not giv to much wine teaches of good things amen that they teach the young woman to be sober to love their husbands Amen to love their children to be discreet chased keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord now we find here the prophet is telling us if we go to our first quote there he's telling us that the morals of society have sunk to an alltime law and it started by a gradual desensitization of people's morals because they started to influence them via their songs songs are something people love they like the music but behind the beat is the lyrics and he says all our songs are about women or sex and lust and things like that amen so how are they starting to desensitize you they put it in their songs they put it in their movies first amen it was a int of a kiss then as time goes by as you get desensitized amen they show you the actual kiss then they show you amen these people completely naked why you desensitize to it and then it no longer shocks you right you know like that frog in the water you throw it into hot water it will jump out immediately but if you lay there in the tub and you gradually eat up the water the Frog gets comfortable until the water reaches like boiling point and the frog dies in the water but born again Christians ought not to be consuming the things of this world if there's anybody listening to pop music rock music amen music of the world you ought to change your music you can't claim to be a believer and then feeding off the things of the world you don't realize but it is corrupting your morals so the prophet is saying all look at how it sat it's saying all of our songs amen and then they putting sex on the TV lust and things like that it's now it's no longer on the TV it's there on your phone amen you can access anything on your phone yes right so you ought to be a good Steward and a good manager over what's entrusted to you amen hallelujah we can't corrupt our minds by looking at pornographic material we can't corrupt our minds by listening to songs amen because it's there at your fingertips amen laughing at ungodly jokes amen watching comedy shows that a vulgar yes amen and then we say we have the spirit of Christ but the spirit of Christ the Holy Spirit cannot feed on those things if we are comfortable feeding on those things it shows that we don't have the Holy Spirit and we have another Spirit maybe it's a religious spirit amen amen so he says amen old Hollywood and televisions that everything is pushing out that vulgar and ungodly stuff will go Amen to Old stands new stands and everything else everything is some stripped woman or something that's exactly what it started in the beginning and ending the same way it's a shame he says the backbone of Any Nation is Womanhood motherhood amen when it comes to morals and you break motherhood you broke your nation that is why they went after the woman first with woman's lip amen trying to take her away from a place amen hallelujah so they broke the nation and we got a place today till our woman smoking cigarettes and things like that and drinking whiskey and carrying on it's disgraceful so if you think it's cool it's not it's disgraceful amen amen a woman shouldn't be found doing things like that neither should Born Again Believers Christian men amen hallelujah we've got to maintain the morals and keep it high in this 21st century amen at the end of that seven Church age amen when we enter the bride age we've got to keep the morals and the standards of the word amen we cannot compromise neither can we back down we cannot claim to have the opening of the word and still indulge in those things amen if there's anybody that ought to be somebody where the word is displayed and manifested it ought to be yours and my life amen amen hallelujah now when we are looking for this kind of a woman that's holding up the morals and standards when you're single you are given a choice to find this kind of a woman so the prophet is teaching the young men to try and find the right type of a woman and he's encouraging them because once you go and you marry her it's until death do your part amen you can't leave because you made a wrong choice if we are governed by the word amen we've got to stay with the word hallelujah and he says here Amen in the next quote there he says getting into the core of motherhood and when a man starts to get married the type of girl woman it's more than just to look at Beauty you got to get somebody both soul and body joined together somebody that's really going to be your friend and pal that will stick with you through thick and thin even when your body is going through thick and thin you got to find somebody who can stick with you through sick and thin amen praise the Lord not leave you when the our times come because the V of the altar ah in riches in poverty as in wealth in sickness as in health until death do us part you find the morels of people today when their husband gets sick they say oh it's too difficult for me I'm a young woman I can't take care of this man so they divorce him and they go find somebody else amen as we see time progressing it's harder to find people commit to one another because the word of God is not their Foundation yes amen amen they've settled for sitcoms and and movies and and and all of these things amen where they see it in the movies even before people get married they're sleeping around with Partners they've made that cool in the movies they think it's cool for you to sleep around while you're in high school while you're in school while you're in college it is not school amen amen the Bible condemns it the Bible does not condone it come on say Amen somebody amen we ought not to be a bunch of compromisers we ought to stand for truth the Bible doesn't amen condone you going and sleeping with women before you get married committing fornication amen hallelujah and and you better be careful young men because Spirits are lurking around before you know it a gay spirit will come upon you right amen and women as well lesbian Spirits are going around these are demon Spirits people wonder hey they're preaching about 200 million demons I wonder where they are open your eyes and see they're all around you and they are exalting sin they celebrate sin they call it pride amen so we don't condone those things amen we don't condone condone casual dating amen I'm going to preach this morning whether you say Amen or not amen hallelujah you ought to back up the word of God and establish his truths in your home amen because if you don't teach the children at home then I'm going to tell them this morning amen amen hallelujah there's no such thing as going around casually with boys going around casually with girls amen and just going and saying oh we friends we're just going on a date no you guide yourself you you been given a sacred virtue young woman amen you don't want to be seen with every Tom Dick andary amen you ought to be preserving yourself and saying Lord I depending on your will your plan and your purpose and you find a man who loves the Lord more than he loves you you find a man who loves the word of God more than he loves you otherwise when you get into marriage that man is not reading the word of God that man is not teaching the word of God Amen he's the head of the home but he's nowhere to be found amen he's not teaching the children in the word of God he won't bring you to church amen he'll make you stay at home amen those are the kinds of conditions you are going to face and I'm warning you this morning make the right kind of choices the same amen with the men you go marry at Jezebel amen take her from the world and bring her in go marry these denominations are even worse I'll tell you rather marry a Hindu girl than a marry a jezebel denominational girl at least the Hindu girl knows nothing about Christianity The Jezebel denominational girl wants to wear pants and tell you that she knows what she believes the word of God and God loves everyone and he doesn't judge you I'm not saying you must married an Hindu girl now come here with the Hindu girl I'm going to tell you brother you misunderstood me amen hallelujah amen and watch people they lie to you come on you got to be Wise Wise as a serpent harmless as a dove when they want you they're promising you the world I'll change I'll do this I'll do that they do nothing for you after you get married and there's nothing you can do about it now every day you're praying before you go to bed Lord my only way out is death Lord let Sweet Death come to him Lord is the only way out the guy is in a deep sleep you checking him out to see if he's breathing or not making sure now amen hallelujah amen we're making light of it now but these are serious matters amen the kind of woman you want to raise your children the kind of home you're going to have amen so what he says you want somebody who will stick with you through thick and thin he says the kind of woman you know in choosing of a bride will reflect your character no matter what a man professes to be he says watch what he marries it reflects his character amen praise the Lord now the we're talking about morals here and the prophet gives us two examples which I'll go through very quickly one he brings a story about the Apostle and he shows you how the Apostle came and lay at his door outside his home and it had a sick baby it had full of babies but there was one that had a broken collar bone and it was like the Hound was open and there was like things growing there and worms eating it but the mother was sitting there and people he started to ask people advice what he should do some were saying kill it amen but the prophet waited and here we pick it up from here and the prophet is saying day had come old theum laying there I went back thought oh god there she is that o son laying right at my step started walking back through the door the Blessed Holy Spirit stopped me said you called her a lady you took up for her for being a real mother and I sent her to your house to be prayed for amen and you're letting her lay there like a woman at your doorstep amen the prophet is trying to show you the morals of animal life amen is greater than a human life because mothers today don't value their children amen they'll take them and wrap them up and throw them in a garbage can you know there was a case somewhere Joselyn Smith someone in Cape Town mother sold them sold the child grow up child sold him sex trafficking for how much 20,000 that's how much they value life said God for now the prophet is saying I said God forgive your stupid servant I walked out there and said God if you are merciful enough to deal with a dumb animal who has got lady enough about her to raise our babies to send an ignorant Apostle to my doorstep to be prayed for oh God he he the apum in Jesus name I pray he says the old apum turned over and looked at me raised up on her feet picked up her babies and put them in there as if to Bow her head and say thank you and took off to the woods rejoicing she knows a lot more than preachers do sometimes She'll follow the leading of the Holy Spirit if God can deal with a apostle how much could he deal with a human no uncertain sound about that God uses animal to teach services sure does Amen then you know the other story about the deer and the fa amen how this Cru arted Hunter the prophet was hunting with him and he got a whistle that when he blew the whistle it sounded like that of a f a little deer bleeding crying out for mother and he was using this thing to trap the mother and when he blew this whistle the mother came out in the open remember they were hunting now they were going to shoot the deer [Music] amen so now the prophet said that he he blew the Cru outed man blew this whistle and this deer came out and the prophet says oh I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't bear to look at it so I turned away and this person told him you chicken outed preacher and now we'll pick it up here he says well look if I was hungry and I wanted one of the SWS I believe God will let me have it but just to shoot it just to act smart he'll full a wagon up and he went and made him a call some kind of a whistle and could Blow That Whistle and sound just exactly like a fa calling so he says I'm going to go to the next paragraph there 111 one day he stood back in the bushes he had took a hold of this whistle and he screamed and it sounded like a little F crying and just as he did that a beautiful do stuck a head out came stomping out we could see her big brown eyes looking she was startled she was looking around the hunter raised pulled down his rifle to shoot the door the door seen the hunter you know what but the scream of that for she didn't notice the gun she was looking for that baby it was in trouble you know that display of real motherhood and mother love that she' face that gun in the face for death looking in at that muzzle of that gun you know what that displays was so great it got next to him he threw down his gun he ran back and grabbed me around my arm and he said Billy pray for me I had enough of this when he seen that display of mother heroism he says oh the world sees the display of the love of God and a gallant in our human heart what a difference it will be when we let the dove of God come into our hearts and gentle us make us Meek he says there in that brush ala back there me standing there praying for that old boy I led him to the Lord Jesus from then on he was a good clean Hunter amen so what the prophet is telling us we can learn from nature amen how they take care of their young ones yes amen praise the Lord and he you know he goes on and on I I don't have time to go into all of that but he goes on and on and then he tells you how they don't want to have children anymore because it'll just trigger their shape their body therefore we honor women who are willing to sacrifice their figure yeah for children amen amen hallelujah they're not interested in that the baby is more sacred than their body amen hallelujah am so he says that they they rather don't want to have children so they rather take a pet poodle miniature poodle one teacups they call it teacup poodle and they spend more money over the teacup poodle than they were a child and you see how they cry when the dog die they have funeral they have coffin they have everything amen what are they trying to do substitute the god-given nature and Instinct for motherhood trying to fulf with something else amen now yes to the husbands yes to me yes to everyone of us he says but now a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown amen are any other side amen amen I thought I was hearing like you know mono side but a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown she should be honored my mother's a woman my wife is and they're lovely how many of you agree amen I've got thousands of Christian sisters who are highly respect if they can respect what God made them a motherhood and a real queen amen you see we call our daughters Queen but you can see who the real queen is amen a real queen that's all right she's one of the best things that God could give a man and all the men says and all the married men said amen she's one of the best things that God could give a man was a wife besides salvation a man is the best thing if she is a good wife but if she is and Solomon said a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown but an honorary one no good one is water in his blood that's right it's the worst thing can happen so a good woman if you got a good wife brother you ought to respect her with the highest that's right you should do that a real woman and children if you got a real mother that stays home and tries to take care of you keeping your clothes clean sends you to school teaching you about Jesus you should honor that sweet old mother with all that's in you everybody listening autum you're listening you're reading here all the children reading if you've got a mother that stays at home tries to take care of you keep your clothes clean sends you to school teaching you about Jesus you should honor that sweet old mother with all that's in you you should respect that woman yes sir because she's a real mother amen hallelujah you know generally topics like this the people are not interested cuz the men feel intimidated now you forcing me now we're not forcing you we're teaching you the word of God amen amen hallelujah so if you are not aligned now is the time to align amen hallelujah praise the Lord I tell you the thoughts we finished it right yeah I tell you the thoughts of a good Christian mother is a treasure to the human heart that's never forgotten God give us more mothers that will take their children instead of trying to teach them tap dancing and something to ruin and wreck their life will read the stories of the Bible to them and tell them of the god of heaven and peace God knows that we need that above all things now for motherhood can all the mothers say amen for that am amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen we got to close this part now amen hallelujah maybe we can just go through this in the in the quote six there the prophet is talking about sister B Sister B was a woman who just passed on and the prophet is remembering her and how she gave a happy marriage to the husband and was expression of a loyal wife made a home for the children amen even when our times came she put food on the table amen feed the hungry mouths many of you can testify to that even though your mothers may have not been Christian woman may have not been in the message real rugged oldfashioned woman amen fed the children even if they went hungry they fed their children amen hallelujah so in 59 paragraph there he says a never failing plea for her children I don't believe I ever met or left her without her asking a request for those children that showed real motherhood knowing that life is merely a dream or a preparation place for children she wanted to meet them in a land Beyond where there would be no more hard times she constantly would say to me she call me brother bully she would say brother bully pray for my children oh I remember Sister Chinta pray for my children amen none of them will be lost if that isn't expressing real motherhood a mother who is interested in a children interested in her neighbors interested in a husband a loved one it's God in the woman expressing Eternal things that's the point I wanted to drive there when you see these attributes flowing out of a woman it's God in a woman expressing Eternal things amen amen now in closing this part of it I want to tell you that the prophet says in the message invisible Union of the Bride he says there were three sacred virtues given to women he says notice sacred virtue sacred Womanhood sac motherhood honor her husband what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman now see why she's a type of the church which had the same responsibility as a woman had a sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer and to the [Music] word if we are saying we're in the body of Christ we have a sacred responsibility to prayer we have a sacred responsibility to the word he says and to Christ just the same as the woman as amen praise the Lord now in talking about children I got two women in mind that come to my mind now and one of them was AA remember AA even though aan was gone the way of the world and had contracted a veneral disease sexually transmitted disease mother's love for the son was still there amen and she didn't know anything about a message she didn't know anything about a prophet but she got to praying amen amen what am i showing you it's not exclusive for message Believers if somebody is sincere before the Lord God will send a message believer their way as a former of an answer and yeah the prophet is on his own agenda on his own schedule on a airplane going his way but a mother's sincere prayer for a son stop the airplane God had created a storm that would stop the airplane and make him walk through the streets was it Chicago make him walk through the streets until he comes to the front porch or front place of This Woman's house and there she's standing and she says good morning he says how do you know me amen he says well I I was reading in the Bible and I tried to find somebody who I could reference that I was like and I said Lord I'm your shunamite woman where is your Elijah you see we serve a real God am who answers real questions you can go to him with child like friend faith and say Lord I'm your son I'm serving you Faithfully talk to him real yes yes don't use your DS and your dos and your go look in the KJV now how you must talk God don't only understand Shakespearean language amen amen God I'm your son I'm faithful to your word you promis if I was faithful Lord you'll take care of my daily needs you'll take care of this that and the other whatever you trust in the Lord for talk to him real maybe you can't talk to your father that way your Earthly father but you can talk to a heavenly father that way say Lord I'm seeking your will and your plan for this won't you reveal it to me bring it to pass amen say Lord I am your Isaac where is my Rebecca find a scripture that pertains to you say Lord I'm your Ruth where's my boas I can see ev's going to be bombarded tonight amen find something in the scripture you can relate to am attach to it believe it amen praise the Lord amen amen and then I said two women right that was one the next one was at you right oh yes can you imagine third pool anointing can ask anything you want anything you want nothing will be withheld from this woman because she connected with the faith of the prophet and anything you want she display true motherhood I want the salvation of my two boys amen women children amen wives never stop praying for your children no matter how far gone you may think they are never stop praying for your children amen the heart of God can reach down amen the heart of God is affected by a Praying Mother yes amen amen I think if it was a man you would have asked for something else but that you right ask for the Salvation of her two boys amen praise the Lord that's my first message amen praise the Lord I will now go into my second message amen amen everybody feeling good amen amen praise the Lord amen see I prepared two sermons this morning amen praise the Lord that was to encourage our mothers my second part of my message is to show you something else amen Brothers we must untangle these quads before we get here so that I'm not struggling here [Music] please amen second part of my message is this that was my Mother's Day greeting to you and my Mother's Day message for now some of you come really hungry some of you want meat amen so from now till we close the service we will focus on this thought that when man fell he needed to be redeemed and God would use motherhood to redeem men yes there's no other way you would redeem man but he's got to come through motherhood amen so Redemption of man through motherhood is what I'm talking about now we find here in the first in the book of in the Book of Matthew the First Gospel there amen praise the Lord greet your brother and sister somebody say God bless you amen you all looking tense and nervous you feel like you got tricked here now I'm still in my time just because I said you feel like you got two sermons you're feeling uneasy settle down we still in our time amen amen praise the Lord this is the heart of the message now that was my background for motherhood but Redemption of man through motherhood we find in the gospel of Matthew the Bible includes five wom in the genealogy of Jesus five being Grace amen the grace of God now if we are so affected by what Eve did in the Garden of Eden shouldn't we be affected by what Mary Did In The Book of Luke come on now you want to lay all the blame on Eve but you don't want to give any recognition to Mary amen [Laughter] amen blessed are thou amongst all women amen for thou are highly favored said the angel as much as Eve let down the human race Mary provided a body amen the fall through one but the Redemption through another amen amen hallelujah so we find it's it's there in the book amen hallelujah of Matthew you'll find there BBA you'll find Ruth mentioned you'll find Rab mention you say I don't remember good stories about this woman RAB how come God can use her God will use you as well your life is not too far gone that God can't use you when you are cleansed by the blood your slate is clean amen though your SK sins be as Scarlet they are white as snow because the blood of Jesus cleanses you and we have been taught that justification is not just that just shall live by faith like Luther's message justifications means you are forgiven as though you've never done it in the first place that's the loose and TI up by William Mari and brandham amen you know what that means means you are Justified amen you've never done it in the first place amen thank you Lord amen RAB married to what's his name salmon amen and Tomar went in Disguise to sleep with a father-in-law but the scepter shall not depart from Judah amen and God used it amen to bring the lineage forth and then there's Mary 5 in that genealogy amen hallelujah we go quickly now to Genesis chter 3 to see the fall there and why I'm I'm doing this for a reason also for repetition so that the young people also understand that man fell man is not in his original estate the weak kind of man you see is struggling to live is not the man that God designed initially yes man fell because of sin man was a ruler of the earth amen man could speak yes young ones if there was a mountain here and the mountain was in the man's way and he didn't want the mountain there you know women like like to rearrange stuff and maybe one day Eve would come to Adam and say I don't like that mountain is obstructing my view Adam could go and say Mountain be thou moved over there that's the authority that's our ought to be State when God made Man In His Image and likeness he's not going to make an inferior type of a man that man must speak like God Amen that man must have authority over the Earth that man must have dominion over the Earth so we find here in Genesis 3:15 it says I will put talking to the serpent now this is after the fall I will put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed that's what we want to focus on now the woman is's going to have a seed so God is just detailing his Plan of Redemption straight away but talking about motherhood that the woman is going to have a child and that child shall bruise thy head and thou shallal bruise his heel you see Satan thought he was hitting at the heart of Jesus but he was only bruising his heel now there comes a punishment in verse 16 and unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto Adam he said because thou had hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and had eaten of the tree which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow Thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and thisle shall it bring forth to thee you see why is Crown was a thorn he took the curse upon himself thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground that's why we struggle to live for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and through dust shalt thou return and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living so if you and I are to trace our genealogy trace our ancestry we will all land up back with mother with Eve being our mother hello yes we would all end up with Adam being our father and Eve being our mother so I don't know why we don't like one another we all brothers and sisters amen amen hallelujah there's only one bloodline amen so now because what Eve did now remember Eve did not want to do that Eve got deceived because the serpent was settle amen she got deceived into doing what she did amen so that's the first woman that we're looking at was Eve then we go now and we look when God chooses another man Abraham he doesn't choose him in the prime of his life he choose him when he's 75 years old you think God wanting to choose another man to work a plan through and choose this nation and say out of your seed shall come forth a people he choose him in the Brilliance of his youth when his wife is Young and can have children but God's timing is not according to your timing is what I'm trying to tell you amen you can't rush God's timing for your life yes so don't move like Sarah now and get frustrated with God and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door bowed himself to the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away why am I reading this this is typing the seen in Revelation 10 the angel coming down to connect with an end time woman amen must bring forth the Manchild in this hour yeah he's coming to connect with Abraham now let a little water I pray you be feted wash your feet rest yourself under the tree and I will fetch a morcel of bread and comfort to your hearts after that you pass on for therefore are you come are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said now watch this I want you to notice something here they are now if I'm correct Abraham is 99 years old and Sarah is 89 years old the prophet says she's an older woman now Abraham left his land at 75 yes amen and Sarah by this time was Fed Up of hearing that she was going to have a child generally women who can't have children go through depression and if they can't handle it life they can't handle it correctly they get bitter they'll get bitter and Sarah wasn't the best of natures if you follow the life of Sarah She chased a servant girl you got to read between the lines now amen and pick up the nature and character She chased a young mother with a child amen so the setting is coming now at the time when Sarah is aged when she thinks the promises of the word don't apply to her I'm saying this for a reason in the specific way because the message Community has become aged and the thing the promises and everything the prophet spoke about don't apply to them they feel like they can't produce this you're putting an unrealistic expectation on me my body is old I'm aged where are the m from the' 70s that came out in this message are they still with the same Vigor to see themselves as a super Church super race amen or do they feel aged Amen to see the promise of God come to pass in their own lives amen we reading about Sarah as a type now but she couldn't see herself as bringing forth this child now if you notice here what Abraham does when he goes to her the story is in the details there amen hallelujah I want you to get a a quote for me brother Joshua amen praise the Lord amen amen is there any anything too hard for the Lord preach 1960 March 28 from paragraph 22 let's just read the scripture as well while he's looking for it amen and Abraham ased into the tent unto Sarah now picture your home life your home setting women don't like unannounced visitors Sarah was no different especially an 80 year 89 old woman if you didn't catch it already she never came out even the Lord had to ask where is Sarah your wife the prophet says she was a little upset that day she was [Music] fuss she didn't want to hear anything about visitors that's why you see Abraham running through the kettle trying to find a kid and he goes to her he tells her trying to buttt up honey please I got visitors here please make some cakes he's like who these people now came here unannounced unannounced in 1963 who just coming to put an expectation upon me amen amen amen hallelujah but only Abraham knows they arrived where is his servants why is he not instructing them have all men forsaken him did Prophet say that all of men all men have forsaken me demons has forsaken me amen he says I will fetch a morcel of bread and Abraham as in verse six Abraham as into the tent and to Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal needed make cakes upon the Earth Abraham runs to the herd fetch a cal tender and good and gave it to a young man where were all the old men where were all the servants amen gave it to a young man and he AED to dress it and he took butter and milk who's doing this Abraham is doing it he took butter and milk and cough which he had dressed he had dressed I thought he was servants amen but he had to meet the angel himself [Laughter] am who had to bring the Seven Seals amen he himself had to meet get caught up in the constellation he had to do it Hallelujah he had to go west yes Lord he had to move his own family there amen and said it before them now doing all of these things but Sarah is nowhere to be found with hospitality before them he stood by them under the tree and they did eat and then he said unto them where is Sarah thy wife we've eaten now we've cooked eaten fellowshipped I still see no sign of Sarah paragraph you got this quote paragraph 22 in is there anything to out for the Lord he says let's just break it in honor for a minute there she said back there I don't think you got the right uh is there anything too hard you amen this is paragraph 22 6328 he says and here is is now and Sarah let's just break in on her for a minute there she sit back there I wonder how many Fanatics my husband can entertain he's trying to break into a character now and the atmosphere she had amen I wonder how many Fanatics my husband can entertain and there he sitting out there you know and Abraham just interested maybe the old fly bush faned the FES away I see the Angel takes his chair leans backwards back towards the tent and Sarah listening through the tent you know kindly hear dropping listening through the tent she was kind of in an awful mood that morning you got it okay she was kind of in an awful mood that morning you don't see things when you come to church in that kind of a mood so therefore when you come into church don't engage in unnecessary topics that's going to make you frustrated with one another yes you can't be fighting in the car and then suddenly come here put your Halo on you're going to be affected in the service you're going to be in an awful mood he says you don't see things when you come to church in that kind of a mood you just no need of trying it amen you just might as well have stayed home how many of you felt that way if we got honest people yet sometimes you feel I was upset now I didn't get anything out of the service but it wasn't anything to do with the preacher wasn't anything to do with your brother or sister sitting next to you just that you were not prepared for the service you might as well have stayed home you won't get nothing out of it go home see he's even telling you go home when you come to church come pray up come in the atmosphere come expecting Jesus amen Abraham knew the time of the promise was coming close it had to be he was 100 years old he was expecting it any time he watched every minute when he run in told Sarah this I believe is the day of our visitation she kind she kind of looked at him with them big eyes and thought well Abraham you've said that a long time today's woman will be like how long you telling me same [Music] thing if God said so then when the angel took his chair and leaned back he said Abraham seeing that you have got favor with God that you are an heir of the world you're going to be father of many nations you believe that since you are 65 75 years old and otherwise you waited for this promised Child by Sarah I'm not going to keep this from you what I'm going to do I'm going to visit you according to the time of life amen amen I've got an announcement to make maybe you got weary in the waiting but the time of life has come for this end time bride the time of life is here now amen and you know Sarah in there he dropping kindly halfway in an upset mood from a condition that morning she thought in her heart now isn't that a silly thing so maybe people think that way when the preachers are preaching and telling you need to come into a stat of a perfect man you're going to be a super race you're going to be a super Church Invincible Army you're going to speak the word what a silly thing think in in in our day me an old woman yeah I am 90 years old there set my husband Abraham 100 years it's it's not been with me as a woman for 50 years we've been married since we were 17 and he am about 27 how could it be how could it be shared herself all out of condition to receive it when God brought it see she was out of condition to receive it when God brought it to her what's your condition this morning are you in right condition to receive the word this morning if you're out of condition you can't receive what the angel is bringing amen so he's saying yesu was out she had herself all out of condition to receive it when it when God brought it oh my don't never get that in your heart be open be ready she missed it she failed to see it if you don't watch Friends the church is going to fail to see it let's not look for church airos and new dresses let's look for the Holy Spirit to come in the Supernatural and raise some things the church don't need a face lift it needs a birth the Holy Ghost to come back into the church bring back people and that believes in the Supernatural holds and waiting for the coming of the Lord as if it might be an any hour living in them conditions amen yes she was in that shape saying how could that happen in our modern time how could it happen in my condition but it happened just the same Abraham out there waiting with anticipation it wasn't made known to her it was made known to them that was looking for it that's way it comes yet to those who are looking so he was watching Abraham was now Abraham just about the time of life it'll be each month well I'm going to visit you you're going to have a baby and you know to herself went ha Sarah went to herself ha laughed kind of to herself now watch Abraham gets a sign now Sarah was too frusterated concerned about new Ado she had seen or something else watch how the church got distracted the prophet in other messages would say she was looking at Lot's wife how she had the Fashions how she was progressing sometimes we're too much frustrated about the fellow the other fellow that's got the biggest denomination his congregation dresses better than mine they got a bigger Church down the corner what difference does that make I want God I don't care if I have to worship him on the street corner in a cold shed wherever it may be I want God let me have my art in condition if I wear overalls so I can watch God and see him move and recognize him not pass it by he said Abraham where is Sarah a stranger never seen him before where is your I already he know her name where is your wife Sarah how did he know he had a wife how did he know that her name was Sarah she's in the temp behind you and when Sarah laughed he said why did she laugh he caught the sign he knew what it was Sarah didn't get it she even come forth and tried to deny it God would have destroyed her upon that if she hadn't been part of Abraham a lot of times unbelief will destroy us if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus Christ God can't destroy us now no matter of unbelief in s Terror will can God destroy you now amen you're a part of God hallelujah you're the heart of God Amen thank you Lord God can't destroy us now because the blood of Jesus keeps God off of us we are part of Christ just as Sarah was a part of Abraham for we are the bride of Christ and we people who's born of the spirit of God ought to wake up get out of our stews watch for the supernatural sign of the coming of the Lord he signs that he promised amen hallelujah amen amen oh God help us to wake up the day of visitation is here amen oh God doesn't send Angels anymore the holy spirit is that angel amen amen don't get confused now you say he why you know at the convention we were asked a a question we were singing the angel of God not seen for 2,000 years this guy comes up to us after the service why don't youall put Holy Spirit there in place of Angel he had a sincere question you never heard these things before he's the holy spirit is that angel am the holy spirit is that person the Holy Spirit Jesus said he the Holy Ghost when he comes he will do the works that he did he'd be with us even in us he would bring things to our remembrance that he taught and would show us things to come the works that I do shall he do also now we're living in that day we're living in the time amen amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen amen we need to close shortly amen praise the Lord amen let's bring it to a close now amen as we climax now and show you amen how we've got to be in the right condition to meet end time conditions we've got to be in the right right condition to receive the message of the hour yes amen amen praise the Lord amen you can go now to maybe Luke chapter 1 you and you can read the story at home and see how Redemption is going to come through a woman Gabriel comes to a town called Nazareth to a to a virgin called Mary amen the angel appears unto her and said blessed art thou amongst all women for thou are highly favored the Lord is with you now Mary hears his words and she's troubled but watch God will not violate his own word he will not come illegally into the human race he's got to find a woman a virgin that asaiah wrote about and that woman must comply with his plan yes must agree with his plan amen for God to do it any other way will be him doing it illegally and God will not violate his own word God could have created a fully formed Jesus yes at the age of 30 and he could have come into the Earth but God would be violating his law because the seed of the woman yes am amen he spoke it in Genesis amen he must come by the seed of a woman and he says the seed of the woman so yeah he says Mary amen he says you are going to conceive and give birth to a son his name Shall be Called Jesus he will be great and be called the son of the most high the Lord will give him the Throne of of his father David he will reign over the house of Jacob forever then she ask a question how can this be since I'm a vir virgin amen right she has a question then the angel replies the Holy Spirit shall come upon thee and the power of the most high will overshadow thee and the Holy One that will be born will be called The Son of God Amen then Mary in verse 38 says be it unto me according to Thy word amen as soon as she said that she gave him legal authority to use her body amen how many of you can say this that this morning be unto me according to Thy word and give God legal authority over your body amen give him legal authority over your life say Lord I Surrender the moment she said be it unto me according to Thy word all of Heaven went into action amen we've got to agree to our plan amen hallelujah Heaven Must Have rejoiced and they must have gave a Hallelujah and a praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah amen you see this don't mean nothing for you because you don't know what it meant you don't know that the fa of man was doomed we were all destined for hell and and and there had seen glimpses of Christ through the prophets but now y was a woman was willing to Avail her own body a woman that Isaiah prophesied about yes here was this woman on the earth have you been prophesied about yes are you the woman on the earth now yes amen but he's asking you the question as much as he had to ask Mary the question can we use your body redemption's plan will come to its full fruition through your body amen hallelujah hallu amen redemption's plan will come to his full fruition complete Redemption plan through your body you will bring forth the Life of Christ you will manifest The Life of Christ now are we the sons of God Amen hey come on now you got to get your expectation up amen you've got to realize what you are called for in this hour stop being like Sarah and saying it can't be me it is you the angels have come to present to you it is you amen you are going to bring forth a son amen you are going to bring forth the Life of Christ you are going to overcome this age am you are going to withstand Satan's schemes you are going to with understand the Antichrist Spirit you are going to make Satan powerless before you how through your Revelation Lord it is you that God has chosen stop looking at somebody else stop looking to the preacher God has chosen you God wants your body and my body amen God wants to display himself through you somebody give God praise come on somebody say Amen God has chosen Us in this time God has chosen Us in this season amen God has not chosen somebody else stand up and be counted God has called us in this age God wants you specifically therefore he sent the message of the hour the message of the hour could have gone to anyone else but it came looking for you Mama Eagle came crying for you Mama Eagle came crying in your barard looking for you how will you answer the angel thank you Lord will you say be unto me according to Thy word thank you Lord oh you know John didn't have to answer the angel there I'm I'm going very quickly now to show you the end time scene in Revelation 10 yes when John is saw go and take the book he didn't have to listen yes that's a type of Mary amen if you type it up quickly you'll find the quote he didn't finish his complete work through the Virgin Mary that's in pick up your pen and write amen amen or maybe time for buying through the members you might pick it up quicker amen he did not complete everything through Virgin Mary but he's got another Mary here's John a type of the Bride go and take the book he could have said no he couldn't have he could have said no I don't want to go to the angel go and read the message no have you read The Prophet's message no when last you read them no Believers of an end time message without a message Believers of William bram's message without reading his message we believe God sent us a prophet reveal the mysteries of God Amen Hallelujah reveal the mysteries of God you read the messages no what you doing amen what are you doing I'm I'm I'm just finishing here my uh playlist here on Netflix amen I'm finishing my thing on uh Netflix come next week maybe we'll look at it I'm doing series I'm binge watching my series amen I'm binge watching [Music] I'm trying to find the quote here amen uh by and through you're not to spell through don't make by and through the members you got it some of you so serious amen hallelujah he says from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride I wonder who that is is anybody know no no no come on now anybody know he's talking about there amen can you tell me who that is me from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride amen that's me you know when you say things about that you ought to get excited yes that's me she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin amen right then he goes on to say the Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but that a but the Angel's message was the word of God Isaiah 9:6 right amen then he quotes that he fulfilled at the time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her the members now he's talking back to us now the members of the Virgin bride will love him him and they will have his potentials my God is packed with potentials and this virgin bride will have his potentials oh Hallelujah my God is omnicient my God is omnipotent my God is all powerful that is potentials my God possesses the power of the spoken word that's his potentials but who will have his potentials oh somebody get in line with the word of God this morning they will have his potentials for he is their head and all powers belong to him they are subject to him as members of our bodies are subject subject to our heads he says notice the harmony of the Father's son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed to him of the father this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death yes amen then he goes on to say yeah there is a secret of it the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has a mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in the name for she has thus sayth the Lord amen hallelujah those in the bride will do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have that say the Lord who they keep still now I'm trying to get to a point you right they know it has to be God in them doing the works amen this is where I want to get to for fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry amen amen amen the prophet is wrong Jesus did it all what is he saying he did not complete his all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride amen Sarah are you moaning Sarah do you think you're too old Sarah not just s I'm screaming he walks in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time listen carefully it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do yes amen but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific amen time amen yes Lord so maybe you waited 25 years Sarah maybe your life was built Mary must have wondered about a strange and misunderstood life but the time has come now when you must fulfill all of the word amen amen hallelujah amen amen the time has come now when you must fulfill all of the word hallelujah praise the Lord so man fell by a woman and man is redeemed Again by God injecting himself through a through the human race through a woman so a woman who would align to God's plan for Redemption amen hallelujah we know that Isaac was the type of Christ he was the promised son and Christ was a royal son his mother was Barren and unfruitful she was lacking in the knowledge of God you know I'm inan second Peter 2 then now second Peter 3 amen if this things be in you you shall neither be baren nor unfruitful but Sarah was baren and unfruitful God descends to change Sarah's position and an Outlook of Faith that's what he did in Revelation 10 now he comes to change the bridal position he comes to change the position of your faith amen God descends to change Sarah's position our levels of Faith are really low so he descends to give a perfect Faith amen yes his Plan of Redemption must move along and he needs Sarah to believe his word in order to have a body that he can bring Isaac through 25 years of pass faith is decreasing 60 years of pass in the message faith is decreasing amen but faith is strong in Abraham amen doesn't matter what's going on in your life the promise of God's word and his plan for your life must come to pass God now if you pay attention to Genesis 18 God won't leave you faithless and wavering in your faith he will come down and you will speak to you like he's speaking to you this morning amen telling you snap out of your condition you have been chosen of God amen amen the testing of your faith worketh patience and when patience has it perfect work you will be perfect one in nothing you know that's all scripture so what does Sarah do Sarah aligns herself to the thinking of the Angel to the thinking of God and then the Bible if you read Hebrews 11:11 Sarah judged him faithful after the Angel's word she changes of mind she has perfect Faith she judges him faithful amen amen Sarah Laughs Again when she brings forth a child amen she the first time she laughed it was a Heart full of mockery amen she was not believing anything she could not see yourself as having a child I want you to see yourself as having a child bringing forth the man Christ yes see yourself as bringing forth the Life of Christ yes see yourself as doing the Greater Works amen see yourself as speaking the word yes Lord see yourself everything the prophet spoke about see yourself so the bride is been in a similar position of Sarah of Faith dwindling in the fact that whether she would reach Perfection whether she would reach perfect Faith amen whether she would be the Super Church whether she would be the Super race whether she would be an invincible Army a royal priesthood a holy nation whether she'll be a king and a priest whether she'll come to adoption in full Authority but the mighty Angel has come down with title deed to bring man's inheritance in this time to show John the book reveal the book to John amen now John's position has changed the bride the faith of the Bride has changed moving to perfect Faith now so in closing I I want to reiterate this God ordained Redemption plan would be carried out via motherhood so blessed are you among all women you know why because there's other scriptures that you fulfill are you interested there's other scriptures that you mothers are fulfilling woman would bring forth children would PR preach the gospel Amen in this time and season amen you bringing forth children that will fulfill Ephesians 4:11 and bring forth Apostles teachers pastors evangelist yes amen prophets can only come Ephesians 4:11 can only be fulfilled because of motherhood hello yes deacons can only be in the church because of motherhood trustees can only be in the church because of motherhood song leaders can only be in the church because of motherhood singers and and and musicians can only be in the church because of motherhood hallelujah amen so Rejoice mothers amen you are carrying out God's plan you are highly favored amongst all women amen hallelujah I know some of you are saying favor me Pastor in godly woman chosen by God that would bring forth these men nothing can stop the fivefold ministry from coming forth and God is using our women in the church to bring forth the fivefold ministry amen amen the Next Generation coming forth hallelujah yesen praise the Lord amen so we want to thank God we had so much to go through but I got to stop here and Jesus said you must be born again so yes you had a first birth but you must be born again you can't rely on your first birth and get to heav Jesus said you must be born again and except you're born of water and of the spirit you cannot enter the kingdom of God so you must be born again yes we thank our Earthly mothers for bringing us forth but that birth won't take us to heaven we've got to be born again how are we born again into the kingdom by one Spirit we are B we are baptized into the body amen so who's the home do you know all of us have had the same birthing womb the Spirit by one spirit so if we say it in this form we've been birthed into the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost by one Spirit we have all been baptized into the body of Christ amen the holy spirit is the birthing ground we fed all these years on sincere milk of the word amen until we reach the age of spiritual maturity where we've had Heavenly manner amen you know you got to go through stages of eating Foods you can't go to the solid food immediately so the Mysteries are are the stor of food seven C meal we have a mature diet and coming into the stature of a perfect man [Music]
