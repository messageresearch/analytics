[20:14] you
[20:16] [Music]
[20:23] [Music]
[20:32] whenever two or three are gathered is it
[20:35] now much to raise a lot so we left with
[20:39] it now just thinking even better what
[20:43] can separate us from the love of God
[20:45] amen
[20:47] nothing well says nothing nothing at us
[20:51] not what we do that can separate us from
[20:56] the love of God and if you look at his
[21:02] choosing and predestination you've got
[21:06] to choose that's perfect then I don't
[21:11] think any of us have it so he chose us
[21:14] with all our faults amen
[21:17] with all our feelings whatever we go
[21:20] through and see great men in the Bible
[21:25] who did all these spirits anointed of
[21:28] God God who's them and you know there
[21:33] were situations in the life that arose
[21:35] and lot of them fell you look at Samson
[21:40] you look at David you know they were so
[21:44] close to God David a man after God's own
[21:49] heart and I could not using him so much
[21:52] and everything else and you know so
[21:55] nothing will separate us from the love
[21:57] of God
[21:58] it shows us with all praise the Lord and
[22:02] the worst of all first of all he sees
[22:06] our heart I want anything he sees how we
[22:09] feel about anything so I believe is
[22:11] graces with us we're gonna be pledged to
[22:14] the service tonight brother Tong ray
[22:18] Cloverdale Bible in Canada briefs on the
[22:22] 14th of this month for people
[22:26] the thing Father's Day and Skype of
[22:28] something within us and it's something
[22:33] within us that's keeping us
[22:37] amantha something there's a faith within
[22:40] us it will just keeping us amen if I'm
[22:46] especially in this world not at this
[22:48] time people are people are pretty and
[22:53] you wonder what's keeping them
[22:56] so they learn of the Lord and not say
[22:58] the em about faith but we as believers
[23:03] you know faith is keeping us from
[23:06] passing the law from pressing on the
[23:09] metal sea and no matter what we go
[23:12] through
[23:14] amen and God has been gracious to us him
[23:17] in the giving us stroke
[23:20] showing us what he went through and what
[23:23] kept him amen never turned his back
[23:27] against God waits alone so I believe God
[23:32] also sauce like that then and he also
[23:34] predestinated us chosen us and no it's a
[23:39] tremendous thing and glorious thing
[23:41] because not everybody can come and serve
[23:44] it now in the real world of the hour see
[23:48] by his grace he chose our sweetness so
[23:50] nothing can change that
[23:52] see so we just thank you for it
[23:55] so I pray that we'll be blessed to the
[23:56] service and so connecting and we can we
[24:02] can also see what other believers that
[24:05] are just part of the world what they
[24:07] believe what their preaching and what
[24:10] they sing to the congregation especially
[24:13] this time like this you know and
[24:14] everything is getting a why and the
[24:18] world don't know where they are going
[24:21] pray you'll be blessed for the word
[24:40] Disease Center or whatever it's called
[24:43] CDC anything and we've got some orders
[24:47] that we have to abide by but I'm praying
[24:51] how we bind that demon and just bind
[24:53] that spirit so that the Church of God
[24:55] get ya there one more time and you move
[24:59] on the authorities and we as a brother
[25:02] this goal is saying we have a unique
[25:04] situation with the border church is a
[25:09] large part of our church is the US side
[25:11] and so we need the orders open and we
[25:14] need our orders changed so God can do
[25:17] anything and I'm looking forward to
[25:20] having a full search again and
[25:21] worshiping the Lord Jesus
[25:23] so don't let you and that keep
[25:27] everything in that aspect in your
[25:30] prayers this week that as I was joining
[25:33] I tied into the service of brother Ron
[25:35] Spencer's and brother Edgar was
[25:37] announced that next week they get that I
[25:39] have a full church and I think I'd turn
[25:41] green
[25:42] I'll green with envy that they can have
[25:45] the whole church together and they're
[25:47] looking forward to a wonderful time so
[25:49] god bless them and those churches that
[25:51] can gather those that have heard them
[25:53] under the sound of this great gospel
[25:55] message god bless the bride around the
[25:58] world so if you wouldn't mind standing
[25:59] please I like to read out a number of
[26:02] scriptures this morning and I'd like to
[26:06] speak on there's something within
[26:09] there's something more than a man ever
[26:13] brother brother made reference to
[26:15] there's something within if you want to
[26:16] check it out as you do your studies
[26:18] maybe this week you'll find that they
[26:21] capitalize to something because if
[26:23] something is
[26:24] something it's the someone and it's our
[26:27] lovely Lord Jesus so there's something
[26:30] within is our title so I think you to
[26:32] turn please then to Colossians chapter 1

[27:02] would make known what is the riches but
[27:06] the glory of this mystery among the
[27:10] gentiles which is christ in you the hope
[27:15] of glory remember the title now there's
[27:18] something within so now that you
[27:22] determine Galatians chapter 2 verse 1
[27:26] Galatians chapter 2 verse 20 very
[27:30] familiar description I'm sure for all of
[27:33] us Paul is writing here to the Galatians
[27:38] I am crucified with Christ nevertheless
[27:41] I live yet not i but Christ living in me
[27:48] and the life which I now live in the
[27:51] flesh I want you to notice now I live by
[27:55] the faith by the live by the faith of
[27:59] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[28:03] himself for me that's why our heads one

[28:42] you may have your seats bless you now
[28:45] I'm going to be following along I think
[28:47] you to follow along with me as we go
[28:48] through number of scriptures here and
[28:51] they also now just the last scripture
[28:52] reading before we start speaking first
[28:56] Peter chapter 1 verse Peter chapter 1
[28:59] verse 7 first Peter chapter 1 what am i
[29:09] and I always say one of my favorite
[29:11] scriptures but they're all of my
[29:12] favorite so noise will start them on
[29:15] verse 3 down to verse 7 blessed be the
[29:19] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[29:21] which according to his abundant mercy
[29:24] have begotten us a game with a lively
[29:27] hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[29:30] from the dead to an inheritance
[29:32] incorruptible and undefiled and that
[29:37] fadeth not away reserved in heaven for
[29:41] you who are kept by the power of God I
[29:46] want you to notice now again who are
[29:48] kept by the power of God through faith
[29:53] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[29:59] revealed in the last time this
[30:02] revelation is going to be revealed in
[30:05] the last time now continue with me
[30:08] please where in you greatly rejoice
[30:11] though now not forth now for a season
[30:15] it may be ye are any heaviness through
[30:18] manifold temptations that the trial here
[30:23] we go to face again the trial of your
[30:26] faith and that's what Peter is now we're
[30:30] honing in on that is the trial of your
[30:32] faith
[30:34] being more precious than of gold that
[30:37] perish that would be tried with fire
[30:39] might be found unto the praise and honor
[30:43] and glory at the appearing of Jesus
[30:47] Christ many scriptures that we read make
[30:51] reference to ourselves within the
[30:54] scripture and we need to see if brother
[30:57] Graham said we need to see ourselves in
[30:59] the word so as Paul was writing not only
[31:03] is he writing to the Colossians or
[31:05] typical ations or the Church of Philippi
[31:08] is also writing to the church in
[31:10] laodicea that is in this age not just in
[31:13] Laodicea at the time of the writings the
[31:17] description so we need to look at the
[31:19] Bible when we need to look at the Word
[31:20] of God as though he's ready personally
[31:23] to ourselves
[31:24] he's our in the David he's earning to
[31:25] buy the Michael he's writing to Ben he's
[31:27] writing to us and a speaking the Holy
[31:30] Spirit is speaking through them because
[31:33] the scripture says that were men evolved
[31:35] moved at the Holy Ghost were moved of
[31:38] God to write these scriptures and so we
[31:40] know then that God wrote the Bible and
[31:43] the Bible is our absolute and our
[31:46] absolute is what we stand on but that
[31:49] absolute that we stand on that we have
[31:53] our faith in it's going to be tested so
[31:58] is this a strange thing that we find
[32:02] ourselves in these dire temptations
[32:05] I don't believe so but I believe is the
[32:09] Prophet said to us and we've quoted it
[32:11] through the years and we know it by off
[32:13] by heart that the entire message meets
[32:16] the in kind condition there are many
[32:18] people today that are under under fear
[32:22] they're under the thoughts that we try
[32:30] to torment them and fear actually comes
[32:33] from that word torment and they worry
[32:35] about what is happening to morale but we
[32:38] have to come to conclusions
[32:40] of God that the God that has revealed
[32:43] himself to us is that God that's going
[32:46] to take us from where we were to where
[32:49] we're going and this is what I'd like to
[32:52] look at this morning is that which is in
[32:56] you that's already started this journey
[32:58] and the thoughts of God and have always
[33:00] been declared that we are the sea gene
[33:03] or we are the journey of God and we've
[33:06] come from God and we're going back to
[33:07] God and we thought we thought that but
[33:10] now we we actually understand that by
[33:13] maybe memory he said well I've heard
[33:16] brother Tom picture matter but the
[33:18] visible picture on a different bus
[33:19] bridge on that and when we understand
[33:22] that because we can memorize that or we
[33:25] can actually have an experience of what
[33:28] they're speaking of and that's what I
[33:30] wanted our rest on this morning is that
[33:33] where we're going and what God has done
[33:35] thus far with in our lives it has not
[33:37] been you at all it has been that
[33:40] something in you that is taking you and
[33:43] moving you into heavenly places and so
[33:46] more and more as we go along way more
[33:48] and more even the children of Israel as
[33:50] we we looked at today Old Testament we
[33:53] find it here on the eighth that's an a
[33:55] very powerful very powerful chapter that
[33:59] the children of Israel actually started
[34:00] to say that they got a deliverance out
[34:03] of Egypt by their own personal strength
[34:06] or anything that they had Trant ain't -
[34:08] was because of themselves and we have to
[34:12] start looking back at Nina shadowing
[34:14] types and start realizing it's not what
[34:17] we did to achieve anything is all of
[34:20] what God has already done in
[34:22] for us not going down the paths now but
[34:26] also in the future so there is a reason
[34:30] and you have to it myself we have to
[34:33] understand that what's the reason that
[34:35] God is calling us or dealing with us and
[34:38] showing the Satan number one that this
[34:43] brought will not fail but I want to go
[34:47] back to the scriptures now and fine I
[34:50] want you to follow along with me because
[34:52] the scripture has to be the absolute
[34:56] that you fall back to and those
[34:59] scriptures at the Prophet unveiled to us
[35:02] and God has revealed to us personally
[35:06] are the scriptures that we need to walk
[35:08] in faced by so let's turn to first Peter
[35:12] 1 and 7 again and I'd like you to follow
[35:15] along in that verse with me again but
[35:20] the trial not trials but the trial of
[35:25] your faith a lot of times people take
[35:28] all the trials we're going through but I
[35:30] want you to look at now the way that
[35:31] Peter actually pinned the by the
[35:34] scripture down is the trial of your
[35:37] faith the trial of your faith being more
[35:44] precious than gold that perishes though
[35:49] it be tried with fire so now we
[35:51] understand as we're reading and slowly
[35:53] there's gonna be some trials and the
[35:55] trials that have come it's not you your
[35:58] everyday living trials
[35:59] we're talking about the things that God
[36:02] has revealed to you it's going to be
[36:06] challenged and so then you actually have
[36:09] to understand them than if the God has
[36:12] revealed something to me brother Graham
[36:15] said there's not enough countries in the
[36:19] world
[36:19] that's going to stop me from achieving
[36:22] what God has
[36:24] for me so now God has a purpose in that
[36:28] call and now Satan is going to try your
[36:33] faith as we have seen over the years
[36:39] many people's faith or their revelation
[36:42] has been tried it's been tried by trial
[36:45] and it's been tried by fire and it
[36:48] hasn't stood because sense of God it was
[36:52] a learning and not a revelation and
[36:55] that's what I would like to look at
[36:57] today because once it's revealed to you
[37:00] nothing can shake you from the promise
[37:04] so are you young people when you hear us
[37:07] preaching better job it's not just
[37:10] preaching to preach a message it's to
[37:13] preach a word that will come into your
[37:16] heart that God have happened we'll come
[37:19] and inspire it team up so that when
[37:22] Satan comes
[37:23] he's coming against the word yes and
[37:26] that word cannot be moved it's not
[37:30] learned it's revealed now the trial of
[37:35] your faith Peter is writing the trial of
[37:41] your faith I often have said over the
[37:45] years when Michael was a little boy
[37:47] whenever he had read books which he did
[37:49] often he'd always read the end of the
[37:53] book and obviously the Micah said why
[37:57] are you reading the end of the book he
[37:59] says well I like reading into the book
[38:01] because I like to know how this story
[38:02] comes out and so I like to read
[38:06] revelations because I like to know how
[38:09] the church turns out and I know that
[38:12] there is a church triumphant that's
[38:15] going to overcome and leave the sea you
[38:17] ain't no different than no
[38:20] I think build an ark for the saving of
[38:22] his household it was by his faith that
[38:25] was going to be tested his face
[38:29] the triumph of your faith
[38:32] I would say this cool man is really
[38:35] coming against your face the different
[38:40] ones I have talked to the different ones
[38:42] and we've talked to many they said
[38:44] brother Tom tell the Saints we're
[38:46] standing strong and I and I thought it's
[38:51] not very standing amen
[38:53] but it's the face of the word of God in
[38:57] him that's something in them that's
[39:00] holding them they're not afraid of the
[39:02] virus they're not afraid they're not
[39:04] under fear but they're walking in faith
[39:07] let me read something brother Brown says
[39:09] in the fourth seal he says there was a
[39:12] life riding on a white horse and here's
[39:16] a man with three different powers mixed
[39:19] up called death now there he is an
[39:23] Earthbound delegates and Christ now is
[39:27] gathering his heaven-born subjects
[39:30] he's got death Road on him and Christ
[39:35] has got life wrote on him so you see
[39:39] death and life are in the struggle again
[39:42] he said those with him on the white
[39:45] horse are called the chosen before the
[39:50] foundation of the world so it's the
[39:53] chosen that God gives them faith to
[39:58] overcome the world
[40:00] now watch even their faith now that
[40:02] faith that God puts in you is going to
[40:05] be tried and this by being out in
[40:08] Revelation or another
[40:09] under the for sale you have to
[40:12] see yourself with that word in you
[40:16] chosen before the foundation of the
[40:18] world those are the faithful ones by
[40:22] means of a man it's not like that one
[40:25] you're the cult and chosen before the
[40:28] foundation of the world faithful to the
[40:31] work because God has made this weren't
[40:35] real to you so you're faithful to the
[40:40] word so now as we take a look at this I
[40:43] wanted to turn now to Hebrews chapter 4
[40:46] Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 wonderful
[40:51] scripture Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12
[40:59] that's something that is in you and
[41:03] we'll get into that that's something
[41:04] that is in you is going to be challenged
[41:08] so now the Bible says in Hebrews chapter
[41:11] 4 verse 12 for the word of God is what
[41:17] quick the word about quick it's powerful
[41:20] sharper than any two-edged sword
[41:22] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[41:26] soul and spirit and of the joints and
[41:30] marrow and is a discerner of the one
[41:34] thought the cerner of the thought and
[41:38] intent of the parts let's take a look at
[41:42] what the Hebrew says here the Word of
[41:45] God is living and it's active and it's
[41:50] full of power so abandon people for the
[41:56] time we are the Word made flesh thing we
[41:58] sing it often I've got that word living
[42:01] in me
[42:02] to see what's that something that is in
[42:04] you that's living its Christ in me the
[42:09] hope of jewelry so now here is Paul
[42:13] writing to the Hebrews for the word of
[42:16] God is living it's active and it's full
[42:22] of power the Word of God it makes it
[42:27] operative it's full of energy it's
[42:31] sharper than any two-edged sword it
[42:34] divides asunder to so much spirit and to
[42:38] devote to both the joint and marrow the
[42:41] deepest part of our nature exposing and
[42:44] judging the very thoughts and intents of
[42:47] our heart so God sees what's in a
[42:50] believer God knows what's in your heart
[42:52] this morning and the Word of God is here
[42:55] too now brother Graham said the word of
[42:58] God faced up by Arian everyone the Word
[43:00] of God so now this word that you're
[43:03] hearing is coming over this Bolton but I
[43:07] want you to hear it from a different
[43:09] place from your ears to your heart I
[43:12] want that word to drop down to your
[43:16] heart there's many people that hear with
[43:19] their ears and hear not Jesus said but
[43:23] there's another people that is here with
[43:25] a different hearing and that word is
[43:27] sharper than any two edges are piercing
[43:30] asunder so now we want that word that is
[43:34] full of power that worth and is living
[43:37] that word that is active we want it now
[43:41] to come to the surface and show to those
[43:45] that are around us we need are standing
[43:49] true to the Word of God but the rent
[43:52] said now I want you to notice here
[43:54] he said notice faith is a revelation and
[43:59] if I ask you this morning how many times
[44:02] that brother branham say
[44:03] faith is a revelation because thing has
[44:08] to be revealed to you how many times
[44:11] brother Brown say that he said my father
[44:15] brother Brown sell a lot of times as we
[44:18] hear it
[44:19] faith is a revelation and so in many
[44:24] times Revelation gets overused but I
[44:27] want you to understand brother Brown
[44:28] says that five times he says it five
[44:32] times once an anointed ones once an
[44:35] invisible Union twice in Martin st.
[44:39] express and once the rock to the Branson
[44:44] revelation is the only thing revelation
[44:47] of the word what is a revelation upon
[44:50] this rock I'll build my church and the
[44:51] gates of Hell cannot prevail against it
[44:53] so faith is a revelation because faith
[44:59] has been revealed to you the trial of
[45:03] your revelation it is going to come down
[45:08] to your address band it's not something
[45:11] that we just look in the scriptures and
[45:13] we're going to go through trials we're
[45:14] going to go through a lot of trials
[45:16] whether you get a job whether it gets
[45:17] fired whether or not this whole economy
[45:20] is going to crumble but now we have to
[45:23] start to understand then that it's our
[45:26] faith that God is interested in seeing
[45:29] that that same that gets tested is
[45:34] unshakable it's unmovable and we cannot
[45:39] fall brother Brian said so now we look
[45:42] at the word what is that
[45:45] that is unshakable in us the faith that
[45:49] revelation that God's revealed to you
[45:51] let me record another quote faith is a
[45:56] revelation from God faith is a
[45:59] revelation the rest of that work
[46:02] sustained Express there's where I want
[46:05] to stay just a moment it's a revelation
[46:09] he has revealed it to you by His grace
[46:15] so this word that God has revealed to
[46:19] you has now been revealed to you by what
[46:21] His grace this word is revealed to you
[46:27] by His grace it's nothing
[46:30] Tom did Vincent it's nothing you did you
[46:35] didn't work up to this you didn't work
[46:39] yourself into it you ever had faith it
[46:43] was given to you by the grace of God so
[46:47] this trial of your faith is given to you
[46:51] by the grace of God but he's going to
[46:53] give you the grace to go through that
[46:55] trial did he get that this faith is
[47:02] given to you by Grace and he's going to
[47:05] give you grace to go through the trial
[47:08] of your faith he revealed it to you by
[47:13] His grace God reveals it to you think
[47:16] there's a revelation the whole church is
[47:19] built on now here's the last time he
[47:21] says it in the rapture but to the church
[47:25] the bride the rapture is a revelation to
[47:30] her it's revealed to her that'll be the
[47:37] grace of God that reveals the rapture to
[47:41] her that the revelation the true bride
[47:45] price will be waiting for the revelation
[47:48] sin of the rapture the true right of
[47:53] price is now waiting for the revelation
[47:57] of the rapture this will be your trial
[48:05] Satan will defeat you he's not buffeting
[48:09] you by here your external or external
[48:13] trials that you have you don't have
[48:15] gasps you don't have a mortgage payment
[48:17] you don't have rent you don't have this
[48:19] is part is not what Peter is writing
[48:24] about he's writing about your faith your
[48:29] faith is what's going to be tested so by
[48:34] faith Abel offered by faith Noah built
[48:40] an army
[48:40] by faith Abraham was called by faith
[48:45] Sarah can see strength by faith Tom
[48:50] received a revelation of this message
[48:53] that's going to put him in the rapture
[48:55] by faith and every one of those that you
[48:59] read in Hebrews 11 it was by faith and
[49:02] their faith was tried to get that their
[49:08] faith was tried it's tried by fire give
[49:17] you imagine coming to church and I look
[49:20] at this church like this pretty false
[49:22] one what there's what half a dozen three
[49:26] full but do you know brother Graham said
[49:28] he said Noah preached four hundred
[49:30] twenty years and only preach to a family
[49:33] can you imagine doing that I can barely
[49:36] get through these last three months
[49:37] pitching to half a dozen people but for
[49:40] a hundred and twenty years by saying
[49:44] Noah was tested my faith Abraham
[49:53] I said a cordon off that promise his
[49:55] promise it was his revelation that I was
[49:59] gonna come a promise and that was his
[50:01] revelation it was going to be trapped by
[50:03] fire giving you by do it
[50:13] Abraham by faith offered unto God a more
[50:17] excellent sacrifice would never been
[50:19] able by saying there is going to be
[50:21] something that's going to be tested and
[50:24] when he went out to the mountain he said
[50:25] the land I shall return he didn't know
[50:28] what God was going to do it the way he
[50:30] did it but God's showing him that that
[50:33] Sun was coming back I don't know how
[50:36] you're going to get into this right sure
[50:38] but I know one thing if you're the call
[50:40] of God God's gonna revel at you and
[50:43] bring you into another revelation and
[50:46] Saints about we're going to be changed
[50:48] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[50:52] by faith I think that's how I'd like you
[50:55] to turn to Hebrews chapter 11 with me I
[50:58] love the scripture here Hebrews chapter
[51:01] 11 just so that you know since of God I
[51:05] don't believe you're gonna get off easy
[51:07] I don't think any one of us is gonna get
[51:14] off easy this is not a silver plate in
[51:17] gospel you're gonna have to fight for
[51:19] everything that's within you but you
[51:21] have to know that there's something in
[51:23] you that's greater than what
[51:25] they can throw at you to keep you from
[51:28] this great revelation hebrews chapter 11
[51:32] the Bible says here in verse 32 and what
[51:37] shall I say for the time was fail me to
[51:39] tell of gideon barak samson jephthah of
[51:45] david samuel of the prophets who is sure
[51:50] what safe through things the fire
[51:57] escaped the edge of the sword and out of
[52:00] weakness were made strong waxed valiant
[52:04] in fight turned to flight the armies of
[52:08] the aliens women sisters received their
[52:13] dead raised to life again others were
[52:16] tortured not accepting deliverance
[52:18] sixty-eight million martyrs think about
[52:22] it that they might obtain a better
[52:24] resurrection and others had trials of
[52:27] cruel mockings scourgings moreover a
[52:30] bombs and imprisonment they were stoned
[52:33] they were sawn asunder what was the
[52:37] enemy fighting he was testing the trial
[52:43] was coming to test their faith can you
[52:48] stand and I want you to say within your
[52:52] heart this morning it's no longer me
[52:55] that standeth but it's Christ in me
[52:58] that's going to stamp the onslaught of
[53:01] the enemy they thought of faith and the
[53:08] Bible says in verse 39 and they all
[53:11] having obtained a good report through
[53:13] faith received not the promise go on
[53:19] having provided some better thing now
[53:22] he's talking to you God having provided
[53:26] some better thing for us
[53:30] they went up on us should not be made
[53:34] perfect yes
[53:37] that's incredible look how their faith
[53:40] was tested I don't care if it was Damien
[53:44] and I Murphy spoke so wonderfully about
[53:46] it how did the sword was going to be a
[53:48] picture really this picture it's going
[53:50] to be my store but there was going to be
[53:53] a testing of his faith because the angel
[53:57] told him that he was gonna conquer his
[54:00] enemies you have to believe this
[54:02] anything so it's gonna be by faith the
[54:05] testing of your faith I want you to get
[54:08] that this morning it's the testing of
[54:10] the revelation that you have people fall
[54:13] away after years of coming to back away
[54:16] or coming to churches around the goal
[54:18] they fall away sings about because it
[54:20] has not been a revelation to them it's
[54:23] been something they have learned that
[54:25] from the message now notice here I want
[54:28] you to follow the line in verse 40 with
[54:31] me I'm gonna go to the grief and you
[54:34] follow along in now the King James your
[54:39] Bible says God having provided something
[54:41] better for us the greek says this god
[54:46] had us in his mind he had something
[54:51] better for us so that these men and
[54:56] women of faith would not be made perfect
[55:01] that is they aren't there that is
[55:05] completed in iam apart from us so God
[55:10] had to give on us he had something
[55:13] better for us
[55:15] he had that full word to come on
[55:19] so we also can say by saying brother can
[55:24] conquer to Laodicea by faith man you've
[55:29] conquered the spirits that were trying
[55:33] to bring up people down now I don't know
[55:36] about you but I know as we see this
[55:40] world falling apart its falling apart
[55:42] faster than what we would have give it
[55:44] credit for years ago how did we think
[55:48] that a whole world be crippled by a
[55:51] virus who would have thought that a
[55:55] whole world will bend their knee to a
[55:57] virus I don't know what that demon looks
[55:59] like now where the power of it that it
[56:03] is now in folding a people before in
[56:07] gathering and people support many times
[56:09] a church becomes a support system and
[56:14] they come to church to get their moral
[56:17] support and maybe there's a testing of
[56:21] this faith that God has given us he
[56:26] showed you Satan this bride doesn't
[56:29] matter what virus what spirit what devil
[56:32] like imp would come against her she
[56:36] isn't gonna buckle in she's got
[56:38] something went in that is greater
[56:43] without there's something within us God
[56:49] had us in mind and has something better
[56:54] for us
[56:55] can you imagine God knew that we would
[56:58] need the full unveiling of his word to
[57:05] battle and win this contest he has
[57:10] something better for us we would know
[57:14] that in the evening
[57:16] there was it's not going to be called
[57:18] day nor night but it shall come to pass
[57:21] that in the evening time there would be
[57:25] something better for us there shall be
[57:27] light if we walk that in the light as he
[57:32] is in the light then we have fellowship
[57:34] with one another and the blood of Jesus
[57:37] Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin
[57:39] if we walk in the light of the
[57:43] revelation of God's Word that we walk in
[57:47] himself who is the light we walk in
[57:52] Christ we have true unbroken fellowship
[57:56] with him and with one another and the
[58:00] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[58:03] all of our sin so this light that if
[58:08] thought is given us something better
[58:09] this light that is coming as AIDS and
[58:12] it's going to give you the ability this
[58:14] light to shine that's something within
[58:16] to bring for that light this light is
[58:18] living in you it's pulsating its energy
[58:25] it's a work that's active and it's a
[58:28] power and you stood here
