TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hallelujah amen let's stand even as we read the word now Pastor said that the Bri as one objective one Ministry and that's to slay amen every enemy every demonic power yes amen and that's a portion of what we're going to be talking on tonight amen let's go to Genesis chapter 14 and we start reading from verse one and it came to pass in the days of amrel king of Shah AR king of Alysa shaloma King ofam and tidal king of Nations that these made war with barah king of Sodom and with Bersa king of gomorah shanab king of adma and Shah king of Zabo and the king of ba which is zor all these were joined together in the veil of sidm sidm or in other words the valley of sadm Amen which is the salt sea 12 years they serve Chala in the 13th year they rebelled and in the 14th year came tooma and the kings that were with him and smokee the refs in ashtar KH and the zams in ham and IMS in shave y these are some really hectic names and the horites in their MS unto AAR which is by the Wilderness amen so these kings came and they started to Smite these other nations amen and keep in mind the red horse rider amen who was there to Smite the people amen with the red Power going forth with the sword verse 7 and they returned and came to in mishpat which is which is kades and smot all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites and dwelt in Hason more and there went out the king of Sodom and the king of gomorra and the king of adma and the king of zom and the king of Bella and they joined battle with them in the veil of sidim with shaloma the king of ilam and with tidle king of Nations and Amel king of Shah and ARA king of Alysa Four Kings with five so basically they were the Four Kings amen that we mentioned in the first portion of the verse against these five Kings and one of the five Kings or two of the five Kings were Sodom the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah so we know that this is how lot was involved because lot was with Sodom and Gomorrah yes so verse 10 and the veil of sadum was full of slim puts amen and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there you see in these places out in the world and the denominations they are full of slime puts amen and this is where the kings of Sodom and gomorra fell down in the slets in these slets of these denominations and Creeds and dogmas and all of these things this is where they fell and they were taken over and they remained fled to the mountain and they took all the goods of Sodom and gomorah and all their victuals now victuals talks about food and went their way so you see first they started smiting the people with sword which is your red horse rider and now they started to take away their goods and their vual which is talking about the third horse rider amen and they took lot Abram's son now notice Abraham's name is Abram his name had not changed as yet who dwelt in Sodom and his goods and departed verse 13 and there came one that had escaped and told Abram the he the Hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of mamre now mamre we know one of the meanings of mamre is a place of strength a place of fatness am amen Abraham was not living in a place of weakness amen Abraham was living in a place of Plenty Amen in a place of fatness why because he had spiritual food in je season am he was not in hunger amen he was not affected by the third horse power amen but he had plentiful Amen in the plain of mam the Amorite brother of ishk and brother of Ana and these were Confederate with Abram yes amen Abraham was not alone amen yeah and when Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house amen these were servants that were born in the household of Abraham they were a part of Abraham's promise because Abraham and his household yes amen so these were trained servants in the house of Abraham 318 and pursued them unto Dan amen now we know what Dan is typing and we're going to come back to that am and he divided himself against against them and his servants by night and smoke them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the woman also and the people so he never just rescued lot he also rescued the people of Sodom and gorah and and the neighboring vicinities verse 17 and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Thea and the and of the kings that were with him at the valley of sh which is the King's Dale amen and mzc king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God Amen and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth amen and blessed be the most high God which had delivered thine enemies into thine hand and he gave him tithes of all and the king of Sodom said unto Abram give me the persons and take so the persons that Abram had rescued now and take the goods to thyself and Abram said to the king of Sodom I have lift up my hand unto the Lord the most high God the possessor of Heaven and Earth that I will not take from a thread even to a shoe latchet and that I will not take anything that is thine lest thou should say I have made Abraham Rich save only that which the young man have eaten and the portion of men which went with me amen so Abraham does not want the testimony to be that you have made me Rich amen he does not want amen the testimony that the heathens have made me Rich amen because Abraham had his trust and faith in God Amen he knew that he was a possessor of all things if you read amen verse 19 meaz is saying to Abraham Blessed Be Abraham of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and this was before his name was even changed am amen but already he was predestinated to be the possessor of Heaven and Earth amen hallelujah talking about predestination before we can even have a change God had already predestinated what we should be amen that we should be possessor of all things amen you may be seated may God add blessing to the reading of his word amen I think I would I'd rather change back to that mic to avoid the feedback amen so here we see that there's this battle that is going on and Abraham here is going to fight this battle not on his own behalf only but on behalf of his blood rela of lot yes and ab takes trained soldiers or not sorry not soldiers but trained servants from his own household now for tonight for a thought what we want to speak on is overcoming the kings of the Flesh and the powers of the four horse riders and rescuing Lord before communion amen so our emphasis tonight is going to be on a very simple topic amen it's very much based on saving the lost and US overcoming the Flesh and overcoming the powers that are riding in this end time amen so we see that there are four Kings here now that are Waging War against this other group of five Kings and if we look at the names of these Kings if you could just scroll down stop there just to show you that lot and his people were not just captured by just you know ordinary Kings and we think that this was just a normal battle going on if we look at the first name Amel Amel the meaning of the word Amel it means the Sayer of Darkness fall of the Sayer one that speaks Secrets keeper of gods keeper of treasures or speaker of mysteries the enlightener of secret now does this not remind you of the first horse rider who rode out in deception in the first age amen the SE of Darkness it began as a few Deeds of the nians but then it began to become a Doctrine amen amen a doctrine that started to go on and what was the doctrine it was say SS of Darkness amen it was these secret Mysteries that Satan was trying to infiltrate the church with yes so here now here is this King amraa now we just read the passage and you'll knowe that this W was actually the W of choma but when the Bible lists the names of the Kings it does not list Chala as the first king it list Amel as the first king and you're going to see that God does not do things just haphazardly he writes things in the Bible for a certain reason amen God works in a certain order and he's in his mathematics and his Bible perfect amen amen and you'll see that just now so here was the first king and his name means say of Darkness amen type in the first horse rider who rode out in deception then the second king is arok and arok means tall great and long and we know that the second horse rider who rode out and we even read in the passage that how they began to Smite the people we know that the second horse rider began to persecute the church amen and it it was an age of Darkness amen the church ages began to go in the ages of darkness which was some of the longest Church ages amen and AR means tall great and long amen it was some of the longest Church ages in the Dark Ages yeah now look at the Third King which is Chom remember I said the W was actually his W but God listed him as the third King and choma means a sheep band or a handful of sheep and do that ring a bell now if you look at Revelation 6 amen when Bible is talking about the third uh the third seal Revelation 6:5 he says and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and I beheld and L a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of Bali for a penny now a bundle of sheeps adds up to Bali and here the third horse rider is saying a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of Bary for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and wine so here we got the Third King whose name means the Sheep type in the third horse rider now you see why God never list him as the first king even though it was his war God made sure to list him as the third King amen because his name ties in with the third horse rider hallelujah amen now here comes the fourth King which is title and title in the Bible calls him the king of Nations amen now here's the fourth horse rider who is the king of Nations oh yes amen and we know that this four fourth horse rider is so powerful that he's got every nation under this world under his control amen amen and in which age came the United Nations amen it's all in in this age where the fourth horse rider is riding amen the other meaning for title is knowledge of elevation Amen in an age where knowledge has increased yes in an age of great infrastructure and the signs behind the knowledge of elevation amen the fourth horse rider is riding amen amen so you see that this Four Kings now are typing your four powers yes and notice that Chala could not fight the battle himself because all along choma was raining according to what we just read yes but there came a time where the Bible says the people rebelled against shaloma the third horsepower right and so he then United the ask the other three kings to join him and they all remember all three powers unite and become the fourth power amen amen so we look at in what age a man did the anointing of the man go out to combat the third horse rider amen it's where in the age of Martin Luther when they started to rebel against the Catholic church amen men like okay you can just pause there because I believe they want a transition amen amen let's just sing A Chorus in the meantime when the batt over we shall wear a crown we shall wear a crown we shall we Crown when the batt we shall Crown in the new jerus [Music] we we'll we a bright and [Music] Shining when the battle's over we shall wear a in again we shall wear a crown we shall wear a crown oh we shall wear a crown batt we in Jerusalem we we a crown we we wear a bright and shineing when the battle's over we shall in that jerus thank you Lord amen amen so I was saying that remember they started to rebel against this third power to Thea right amen and in which age did they start to contest the Catholic church was in the age of Martin Luther which was the third power which was the power of a man going to combat the third power of the enemy which was the third horse rider so that is why in the age of choma they started to rebel against him and now because choma saw that they started to rebel against him he now needed the power of the other horse riders to combine together to make the fourth horse rider Amen to go after these people yes amen so we see now that this is not just a normal walk but this is typ in how these Powers amen have gotten the world in such a state they've captured the church World they've captured amen the the people of the age of lateria they've captured our family they've captured our loved ones all in this on these powers of the four horse riders combined they've captured them but one person was not bound by the power and there was Abraham amen Abraham was in memory in the place of strength Amen in a place of plentiful he was not affected by the first SSE Rider he was not deceived amen because when he saw amen the angel of the Lord coming He Saw Three Angels coming but he said my Lord he had a revelation so he was not deceived amen amen amen he was not smoked with sword by the second H power amen he is Victorious amen he was not lacking he was not affected by the third hor power he was he had plentiful he was blessed amen amen neither was he affected by the force horse rider which was death because Abraham had a body change yes amen he is able Amen to surpass that yes but here was his family lot amen that was captured by these powers amen and notice that Abraham pursued them unto Dan now we know Dan types the eagle yes and in Dan Abraham gave them a good hiding amen amen because under the anointing of the eagle amen there's no demon power that can Prevail amen under the evil anointing Abraham was able to combat the enemy and was able to defeat them amen and we under the eagle anointing there is no power of death that can come here and take us captive amen amen there's such an anointing over here amen that when death comes knocking at the door it just passes by because there's blood on the door amen there's blood on the door post there's the token applied amen so Abraham came to the place called Dan he chased them till Dan and he began to overcome them there and he began to to defeat them there and then he went on from Dan he went on to a place called habah which means the place of fear of death or hiding and defeated them there so Abraham defeated the power of death which was these four hor Riders combined now defeated them in the place of habah which is the place of death and hiding amen so you see it's not just a normal story of Abraham going to war with these people but there was spiritual uh amen wickedness in high places that were involved here and we know that we are not Waring against the flesh but amen we war against spiritual d principalities in high places amen that is why the seals were open to us so that we can see what we are up against am amen when you go through trials amen and we see things happening in the world we don't just see them as natural events but we see Satan's power that is amen going throughout the whole world killing stealing destroying we saw that in cover we know that the fourth fourth horse rider was death amen and took the third parts of the Earth with him and many other amen not just Co but many other diseases sickness plagues Wars amen all of these things that Satan is writing under but the seals come to open our eyes to that so that we can see how God is moving amen yes amen hallelujah amen so we are talking about today overcoming amen these four horse powers overcoming the kings of the flesh yes and rescuing Lord before communion amen before amen we need to first defeat amen these powers like Abraham and these Kings amen before we meet mezc and have communion with him amen like I said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but there's demon powers yes and war against us amen and sometimes when they can't attack us because the anointing is so strong they will go after our loved ones amen because why they know if they can capture your loved ones in sickness or in the world or in sin then there's the five senses in you because you start you got five senses In the Flesh and five senses Amen in your spirit and you start to feel sorry for them you start to feel burdened for them you start to feel heavy in your spirit when the enemy has them amen trapped so the enemy knows how to get to us and he knew how to get to Abraham amen by capturing lot now we know who was mzc and just for the purpose of the recording in am man so anyone might be watching or maybe the younger people who might not know we know meaz to be Jesus because the prophet that he was God and mor God changing Mass amen from Spirit to word and mzc was the theophany of God Amen and from theophany then became flesh in Jesus Christ so we know that this is why Jesus knew all things now we come the opposite way we come from flesh to word amen but Jesus come from word to flesh so he could comprehend all things we cannot comprehend all things because of that and the prophet goes on to say and we've got the quote there now the difference between him MDC and you as a son he was at the beginning the word and end Mor a body amen I know you know these things but just for someone who might be watching amen the recording he came in and lived in that in the person of MDC then later we never heard no more of MDC because he became Jesus Christ Prophet said it now that settles it amen amen that's one of the things that can settle the tuna's doctrine hallelujah amen MDC was the priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet amen notice he said you'll never been able to know that yet yeah you come like Adam like like me you became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted and what he's saying is you came from the attribute of God which was in God's thoughts to flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't understand it we have never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word amen the prophet goes on to say but and look clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you are a thought at the beginning yes amen you have to come from the attributes of God we know that that proves the predestination of God see you can't be the word unless you are thought you had to be in the thinking first amen but you bypass the theop and become flesh man to be tempted in sin and then if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have all we have one already waiting amen we have not yet the bodies but look when this body receives the spirit of God the Holy Spirit The Immortal Life inside of you that you might not have your your word body yet your body yet but when the spirit lives inside of you it throws this flesh body in subjection to God yes amen so we can't make the excuse that say oh we living in the flesh body so that is why we subject to sin all the time because when the Holy Spirit comes in you The Immortal Life Of God it throws this body into subjection to God Amen he that's born of God does not commit sin yes amen he cannot sin Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen so we can't use that as an excuse to say we haven't been in our theop body as yet God and mor masked in the pillar of fire god and mor in a man called Jesus God and M in his church amen so that is why amen the Church of God is regarded very highly because it's God and mor in the church amen hallelujah just God changing mask amen so you don't just look at the female portion as a separate entity amen but it's God in Mor yes God above us God With Us amen the condescending of God so we know who mdic was amen and here he's bringing communion to Abram right after the victory of slaughtering the Kings and rescuing lot now Jesus said in Matthew chap 26 and verse 29 but I say unto you I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now until that day when I drink it a new with you in my father's Kingdom so we've gathered that mzc is Jesus and mzc is serving communion to Abram but only after Abraham defeats these Powers yes amen amen and Jesus has given us that promise to say that we also will drink of the fruit of the Vine with him a new in his father's Kingdom but before we get there we have to overcome the flesh yes and before we get there we have to overcome the four horse powers amen Satan's power in the end time and before we go there not only do we have to overcome them but we have to rescue amen the Lost which is our loved ones which is lot and in this time amen we see that the the prophet says now communion think of that part of himself now we want to see in type in view the communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of Christ amen and after the struggle is over after you've done got yourself whooped out then is when meaning you whoop out the flesh now after you crucify the flesh then is when you partake of Christ and become part of his being and the prophet says you get it but MDC after his child Abraham had won the victory MDC met him and gave him wine and bread showing that after this Earthly battle is over we will meet him in the heavens and take the communion again so you see I'm getting it from the prophet it'll be the wedding supper I will not drink no more of the vine or eat the fruit until I eat it and drink it with you and new in my father's Kingdom thank you amen so you see before we get there what we have to do now we have to overcome these things amen now notice that lot was a close blood relative of Abram he has family amen blood relatives and lot had some form of righteousness we know that because the Bible says that his righteous Soul was vexed Amen in Sodom so he had some form of righteousness amen amen the only problem is they have righteousness but they deny the they have a form of godl but they deny the power thereof amen you see they have a form of godliness so so notice that lot was not a message believer he was just blood relation to Abram and he believed in God so he was a nominal Christian so to speak or we can say he as a denominational Christian amen we see lot believed in a tuna's Doctrine because when he saw the two Angel he said my lords he do not have a revelation of the one God Amen so definitely he was not a message believer amen you look at Lot's wife they were easily influenced by Sodom and Gomorrah the prophet you know when he's dramatizing Lot's wife and he says you know Sarah was a bit despondent because she saw how Lot's wife had the latest fashions of the day amen you know Lot's wife began to Fashion herself after Sodom and gomorah amen so these were not message Believers what I'm trying to show to you is that lot was a nominal Christian was a nominal Church goer just in any denomination yeah you see lot believed in the message of people the likes of bully gram and or Roberts amen those were the messages that he believed and The Offspring of those Ministries which is every modern T evangelist you see where lot is now amen lot did not have a visitation of the mighty Angel amen right amen amen he had a visitation of angels but he did not have a visitation of the Mighty Angel amen yes Lord amen because the mighty angel came to Abraham and Abraham called him my Lord and Abraham called him Elohim amen Abraham had a revelation of who he was amen amen and the sign of the Discerning of the hearts was performed to Abraham and his group his family yes Lord did not have that yes in fact the sign that lot had was the SM smiting of blindness yes amen yes amen so we can we can conclude Lord was not even a bachelor and message believer you know he was a nominal Christian yes yet though he was a nominal Christian though he was a denominational person though he did not recognize his day and his message Abraham who was the call of God who was the predestinated who accepted the message of the mighty Angel and amen when he saw lot in this condition Abraham began to get into action because this was his close blood relative he began to get troubled in his heart like I said the enemy knows how to get to you amen amen if he can't get to you put a sickness upon your family member amen now Abraham did not have an attitude of condemnation towards lot now notice Abraham could have said you know lot has always giving me problems when he was with me he gave me problems I gave him the to choose whatever portion he wants he chose Sodom and gorrow now he's landed himself in problems again he didn't want to accept the the message that I was trying to give him he didn't want to listen to me yes and now he's captured because Sodom and gomorra got captured lot got captured together with his family and neighbors and everyone else but Abraham did not have that Abraham did not have a superiority complex amen he never begin to say I am the father of many nations amen I am the promis seed amen and the message of the hour is only for me now notice Abraham yes he did separate himself from unbelief he separated himself from lot you know Abraham didn't go down and join lot in all of his you know festivities in Sodom and Gomorrah never go down amen and have a whole party with his family L he never get involved in all of those things he was totally separated amen because we know that God calls for total separation from unbelief amen but when lot needed saving though he separated himself but when lot needed saving Abraham gathered men trained in his own household amen men that were trained in the gospel men that were trained in the message of the hour believe in Abraham's message amen Abraham had a message that he heard from the Lord yes and these were men trained in his household knowing that God speaks to Abraham they have confidence in Abraham because if they did not have confidence in Abraham why would servants go and fight a war remember they were grin up against Kings Kings have kingdoms and in those kingdoms they have soldiers who fight Wars amen Abraham had servants who were tendering the household tendering the yard tendering the Sheep so if they did not have confidence in Abraham they would not have gone to war but these were men who had confidence in the ministry amen amen they were trained in the household of Abraham trained in the word amen like we have been trained now for many years in the household of faith amen amen trained in the word amen we don't have training in the world but we were trained in the household of faith amen and how these servants were trained when they were looking after the Sheep Hallelujah amen hallelujah when they attending the Huds they begin to have training yes and so Abraham could take these men's down and say let's go and rescue Lots hallelujah amen and notice that they were not just trained men in the household but they were part of the promise because it's Abraham and his household was blessed yes the promise was for Abraham and his household notice even when Abraham had no seed as yet that Ela was going to inherit the inheritance yeah now Ela was just a servant so these were servants but they were blessed in the household of Abraham yes now Abraham could have said you see lot I want you not to go down there to that wretched place of Sodom and Gomorrah you know now you paying the price for what you did it's your decision you paying the price of it he could have said that yes you know like how sometimes we say you know these people in the in the denomination they are digging their own Graves amen they chose to sit under those Ministries and now they are lost amen the Satan has taken a hold of them these this fourth horse rider which is a combination of the other horse riders have taken them captive you know we have excellent judges in our ranks you know sometimes in the message we can be excellent judges of people amen now you see you might say that you know yes we are judges because the Bible says the Saints are going to judge the Earth amen correct amen one day the Saints are going to judge the Earth but how many of you know what qualification it takes to be a judge so to be a judge is no different in the natural than my qualification which at the moment I'm an attorney to be a judge it requires the same degree that I have but it takes years of experience practicing either as an attorney or an advocate before become a judge when you're much older in age and you've practiced for years as an attorney or an advocate you can become a judge so you see before you become a judge you have to be an attorney or an advocate and what does an attorney and Advocate do he pleads the cases for the client amen so before you can judge the Earth you have to be able to plead the cases of the Lost amen you have to be able to plead the cases of your family of your loved ones amen you see before The Supreme judge of all the Earth in come in 1963 he had to spend 2,000 years as an intercessory The Advocate who could plead our case amen before he can come as the Supreme judge of all the Earth thank but now we want to go straight to the position of Judge and start to judge amen look at these denomination people amen but we have to amen plead their case now good lawyer no matter how bad the case is he can find a way to plead a case amen he can find a way to plead a case for no matter how bad condition this accused is in amen so we got to be able to plead the case amen of the Lost before we can judge the earth now maybe you say maybe I'm off scripture but did not Abraham in another time when he was when Sodom and Gomorrah was going to be destroyed did not he become an advocate and start to plead for the mercy of Sodom and gomorah he began to plead with the angel and say if you can only find 10 will you not spare Sodom and Gomorrah you see Abraham was not just elevating himself to a position of Judge he began to become an advocate advocating for the people yeah that is why even though Abraham was a possessor of all things and he was heir to all things but he had a Christlike character about him amen he had a heart of souls amen and once again just like how before we commune with Jesus again in that Kingdom as I said we have to slay these powers and rescue amen our loved ones that are captured by these powers and now we know the prophet said that as she nears the head as the bride nears the head she'll be just like him amen amen so if we are to be just like him let's look at how Jesus was when he was here on the earth amen Jesus was known or should I say he was Notorious for going after the Lost amen he was highly criticized for having fellowship with Sinners and tax collectors look at those that were amongst these ranks adulterers amen and the Pharisees criticized him and questioned him for this but Jesus told him he that is whole need not a physician amen amen now in the same way in the message now it's almost as though we've created walls around us in the message and we've cut up everyone that is not in the message we've just cut them off and we've created these walls around us now remember in as much as the Pharisees and the organization types the denomination it's it's a compound meaning because you can have the Pharisee spirit in the message message as well amen if you think not ask yourself what was the main difference between Jesus and his group his disciples and the Pharisees and they group what was the main difference between them the Pharisees had the written law that came from a mighty Exodus Prophet where had the pillar of fire they claimed to be followers of Moses and the pillar of fire now can the denomination people say that they have a prophet with a p of fire they can't say that only messy people can say we have a prophet we have a we have the pull of fire we have the word so what was the difference then between Jesus and the Pharisees the Pharisees had the written law that was given by Moses but Jesus and his group was the same written law made manifest walking in flesh there was no difference in the word the written law that the Pharisees had was the same word in Jesus walking in flesh amen yes so there's the same word in the message but you can have a Pharisee spirit and say I have here's my spoken word book this was given to me by the prophet with a p of fire or you can be like Jesus and be the word made flesh walking and when you are the word made flesh you're so full of light that you can impart life unto the lost but if you don't have life in you then you cannot impart unto the Lost if the life is only here and not in you then you cannot impart and the Bible says the letter kill it but the spirit give it life am amen so amen we see that we can have a Pharisee spirit in the message and start to condemn those that have not received this message but look at Queen Esther now no one else could be Queen but Esther right her family could not be Queen only she alone could be Queen but she was preserved for such a time like this for the preservation of life to save her household to save her people so not everyone is meant to be Queen but why will we put in this position amen amen that's what we coming to tonight why will we put in this position amen hallelujah you blessed so far amen amen amen hallelujah Jesus said he that is whole need not a physician so how so we can say in the message now he that is whole need not a physician amen how many years have we been in the message now amen to say that we still need a physician now we've seen this year how the faith of each individual is rising up right you know we brother Adan and I was talking the other day and I was saying you know one of the highlights for me in these last few testimonies that that I was hearing is not just the supernatural but the fact that the people's Faith are being raised up that they are receiving it by faith it's not by anything we as a Ministry is doing but it's the faith level of the people that is rising up amen and they are beginning to catch it and take a hold of the promises of God is that correct you all heard the testimonies that have been going on which one of us went and can say that we went and did that so it's your own faith amen so ye that are whole need not a physician so if you do not need a physician we need to be out there amen imparting life to the Lost amen amen and we got scripture amen that's going to show us tonight amen I'm going to show you those scriptures and like the prophet said I can show you where God put those scriptures and you can show me where God took it out amen so we are there to impart life amen so how long can we keep the gospel to ourselves how long are we going to be selfish Amen in the message and just keep within our own confines amen that's right Amen in a time like this when you can see the Fig Tree is buing more and more amen how many seconds do we have left until our loved ones are left to perish notice I said seconds not hours not days seconds how much time we have left to witness to our loved ones yes amen until they are perished that's right amen do you know that in as much as each one will have to answer on the day for refusing the message we know that they will have to answer on that day if they' refused the message do you know that you will also be held accountable if you do not share the message because to whom much is given much is required now you remember the parable of the master who gave these dividends or Monies to the servants the three servants there were some servants that invested it and did all kinds of things to make that investment grow but there's one servant said no I'm just going to keep it and hide it yeah he did not do anything to make the investment grow and when the master came back he said you Wicked servant amen you did not amen you know that your master is a hard Master you could have put this am man in an interest bearing account that at least I would have got an interest on it now how many of us have been sitting in the message like that servant with the message that the goods that God have given us all to ourselves amen not gaining any interest on it not gaining any souls for Christ amen not saving our loved ones when the master Returns what will he be able to say to us amen is he going to be able to say to us amen that we have done well we have gained great dividends from what God has given us amen God saved our souls and we save 10 others or are we going to say master you know I just kept this message to myself I know that you worked hard to give us this message you sent your prophet and your Prophet lives such a life he sacrificed himself so I just wanted to keep this message and treasure it to myself is that what we're going to say Amen you will say you Wicked and adulterous servant amen yes oh I hope you can sense the coming tonight yes and I know why I'm preaching this message tonight because like I said I I did not want to preach this message tonight I tried my best to look for any other message that I can preach but the angel of the Lord kept me on this message amen I told my P my secretary today who was sitting in front of me you know I didn't have this the the the thoughts and the inspiration about the four horse riders I didn't know it until today I already had prepared all my notes yesterday and I sitting at my office today and these inspiration just started coming and I told my PE if only you knew what is happening right now you're sitting right in front of me you don't know that the angels of the Lord is coming down into this office right now amen oh thank you Jesus so when the Lord speaks amen hear theuk that is coming tonight how long will be selfish with this message amen amen the Lord has given us life amen this message is life this message amen Paul said I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ oh Hallelujah for it is the power of Salvation to them that believe I'm not ashamed of this message of this hour Lord for this message of the hour is the power of Salvation to them that believe love you Lord Jesus Hallelujah Love You Lord oh Hallelujah you see Jonah thought he could run away from his responsibilities yes oh Jonah was a prophet of the Lord amen and Jonah began to think you know you know Jews have sort of a complex about themselves you know Jew Jews think you know we are the the chosen of God yes I wonder if we get like that sometimes in the message amen we are the chosen of the Lord and Jonah did not want to go down to this people in Nineveh yes amen even though God told him go down he did not want to go down there he began to think who are these people these gentiles that God wants to now give them a chance to repent amen this wicked Nation why must God give them a chance to repent but amen God begin to teach Jonah a lesson amen Jonah had to swallow his pride and get swallowed by a whale yes amen and God begin to teach him a lesson amen amen you know I I put this cartoon on for Shak it's called super book and and in this cartoon they dramatize the Bible stories and I was watching whether the story of you know Jonah and Nineveh and he just dramatizes there how Nineveh was so angry with God why would God want to go down and save this gentile people yes he was so angry with God and God began to tell him God put a tree over him to give him shade and God be and and then Jonah was just relaxing under the shade and then all of a sudden this tree fell down and Jonah began to say God is it so hard to spare the street that was giving me shade and God said why are you getting so angry for a tree that has come up overnight something that you did not plant something that you did not labor for I have brought it up overnight why would you get angry so he's trying to tell him that I have brought the people of Neva you did not bring them why are you getting angry if I saved them amen look at the when Jesus went to Samar uh samarita amen not everyone was happy about that they were like Jesus why are you yes the Jews here why are you going to Samaritan woman why are you going to the people of Samara we are the chosen people amen but you see it's very easy to stay within the confines of the message now what does revelation 10 8 and 11 say amen amen not that we must prophesy to the four corners of the message amen but thou must prophesy again to Nations KS and T amen amen and the Bible says they that have the Holy Ghost sigh and cry for the Abomination the city the prophet preached a message unless you are convinced you will not be concerned but when you are convinced of the message oh Hallelujah this is coming now when you are convinced of the messag if you really believe the message in your heart if you really believe that the Lord is coming Hallelujah if you really believe we in the end time you'll begin to have such a concern for your loved ones that's right oh there will be such a deep concern amen for those that are lost yes amen amen now we want to go back to the book of Acts we always say that you know and you know in the book of Acts they did not just gather on a wedness day and on a Sunday and say you know what let's let's just gather on a wedness day and Sunday and hear a nice message you know let's have a combin once a month amen get a nice visiting Minister amen just so that we can rejoice in the in in the this bubble of the message that was not the book of Acts amen the book of Acts was them laboring amen the book of Acts was them going out and getting new converts daily the Bible says new converts were added to them daily yes now we are seeing amen that our hearts our faith has been restored and turned back onto the faith of the Pentecostal fathers hallelujah amen the prophet was never like that amen you notice the prophet was open wherever they invited him to preach he went to preach no matter what denomination it was no matter he associated with many denomination uh ministers and he was careful to say I am not attacking the people in the denomination but I'm attacking the system amen you see we got to be so careful to discern between the two between the system which we hate because God hates the system and the system is cursed and the prophet said the system will never come up again it's cursed amen but the people that are there there are some good people there there are sincere people over there lot is there amen amen and how many of us then can say we've LED more people to Christ than William brandham well how can we if we only stay within the confines of this message right it's a simple equation as 1+ one you want to save Souls we got to go out there amen Mark 16 says amen if we we don't have the slides up but amen I'll just read the scripture amen verse 17 Mark 16 and verse 17 says and these shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents amen we know the rest of the scripture amen we we we've been speaking about how this is us these signs follow us we are the Believers amen but how many of you know that in the start of verse 17 there's a conjunction there the word end which means the preceding verse is just as important as that verse and what is the preceding verse it's Mark 16:16 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and his baptized shall be saved you see we want to jump into verse 17 and these signs shall follow them we lands of the sick they'll recover and we'll do all of these great things but we're not fulfilling the very first part amen now look at the scene in Mark 16 Jesus is about to leave the disciples right he's about to ascend into heaven and he's about to give his disciples instructions now knowing that he is leaving he could have given them any kind of instruction he could have told them anything but look at the instruction he gave them he left them with Mark 16 go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature amen this is the instruction that he has given to them before he leaves you see he could have told them you know just just stay there in the upper room he did tell them wait in the upper room but only until the Holy Ghost comes upon them and he could have he could have told them you know just stay here you believe that I am he you 12 disciples or whoever else is with you you just form a church amongst yourself you know have a weekly meetings have a monthly combine you know get Peter or one of the top guys every now and again just to give you a good sermon anybody says go into the world and preach the gospel amen and in an age like this where the world is at our fingertips in the fourth dimension amen we don't literally even have to even go travel the world now it's literally there in our fingertips right so we saw that just before he left amen he gave them this instruction and notice in Revelations 108 and 11 the Mysteries have been finished right the mighty Angel come down with the open book The Seals have been unveiled the seventh angel completed his ministry and the mighty Angel could have stopped John and said John you know you eat the book and after you eat the book just enjoy this book did that is that what the angel told him just enjoy this book you know just keep this book amongst yourself get fat with this book just continue eating this book and get fat but he said no go and prophesy again amen after John began to eat the book he had to prophesy again to kindreds Nations and tongues now doesn't that sound familiar doesn't it sound like Mark 16 after the first part of Redemption when Jesus died and rose again he's leaving he says go into the world after the second part of redemption he comes with the open book and he opens the seals to us he says Thou must prophesy again amen you see this is a recurring theme that Jesus is instructing us and if we are not obeying that instruction then there must be a problem that's right amen thank you Lord now you see you you might say you know we believe yes we do believe in Saving the lost we're not saying that we don't believe in Saving the lost but our actions is what matters you see Abraham could have just stayed there and said you know what I believe lot will be saved you know but he had to get into action he had to literally take trained men and literally go and fight the battles you had to literally go and overcome the Kings you had to literally go and save lots and only when he had done this then he met with mdic then then he came and had communion with mzc amen amen the prophet says for this MDC king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him a man Abraham lot his cousin had daxid you see the real true Spirit of Christ I hope you get it amen now the prophet is saying I hope you get it amen we got to pay attention no matter how far lot had backslid when he he was in trouble here come Abraham to him with an army the anel the the AL aliens round about through the valleys of Sodom he had come down and had took the king the Sodom and its Kings amen so we see that amen we got to rescue lot amen now you know you say you know what let's let's let's not talk about these simple things let's let's talk about you know the third pole let's talk about some deep Mysteries amen now let's look at the third poll because under what Ministry did sister atti have the salvation of her two boys it was under the third pool Ministry amen which you could agree with what the prophet was saying and the prophet said right now a super anointing come down he said now say what you want amen amen under the third pool Ministry you see the third pool Ministry involves the saving of the lost you can have your loved ones under the Third Ministry you can claim them you say you know but how are they going to be saved you know they don't listen to me they don't listen to the message that we preach you know how are they going to be Sav claim them amen amen we've been speaking the whole year you have the power Amen in fact what the prophet said to a right that's been said to you this almost the whole year in this church you've heard the minister saying say what you want speak what you want how many of you when that was said took advantage of that and said I'm speaking for the Salvation of my loved ones I'm speaking for the salvation amen of my friends yes amen you see under the third pool Ministry you can claim that amen yes Lord now not only that what's the other part of the third pool Ministry the prophet said the other part of the third pole Ministry in Jesus life was preaching to the Souls Lost in prison now so even if they are not meant to receive what you are saying you still got to preach it to the lost because they need something to stand stand against them on the day of judgment yes now imagine if they come on the day of judgment and God is judging them and they say but God I didn't hear the message then who is God going to turn to he's going to say but this is my son he was responsible for giving you the message yes amen you see so another part of the third poll is preaching to the Lost amen the prophet says and the last name when the last name goes into the book or the last name is redeemed and was put in the book that settles it he comes to what he redeemed amen and it might be a strange time did you ever think people will go on preaching and the church will go on right on even thinking that they're getting people saved and it's too late then amen it's all over see and the message will go totally lost so you see under the third pool also comes the preaching of the Lost amen let's just try and get this mic back on amen once we getting this you see it's all well and good to want to be Esther amen but Esther had to be in a place where she could plead for her people amen there comes a resp a great responsibility with what we have Amen to whom much is given much is required amen amen I'm not going to amen I'm just going to skip the quotes about preaching to the lost because we know amen that was the third part of Jesus ministry the third poll amen so you see some of them will never accept it but it's our responsibility to preach it yes right amen now now don't get me wrong as well I'm not saying that we are to bring everyone in the message now because not everyone is predestinated to receive the message we know that we know this message is for elect people a minority people the bride of Christ yes right but how many of you know the prophet there are different groups of people in heaven amen there's the bride who's the Queen of Heaven there's the servants which is the 144,000 but the prophet said there was a multitude of people saved in Tribulation yes a multitude of people a great multitude of people you see you might not be able to bring someone into the message but you can sure save their souls from Hell amen you can sure pull them out of hell amen amen we might not be able to get them yeah but at least save them from Hell amen and that is what Abraham could not pull lot into the message of the hour lot never became a message believer after that you know what happened with lot's lineage he never became a message believer but he has saved from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and that is what I'm trying to say tonight we cannot bring everyone into the message but we can save them from hell if not us then who If Not Us Then Who because their own teachers remember what happened to the kings of Sodom and gomorra they themselves got taken captive and we never say what the five Kings type we spoke about the Four Kings who took them captive but what do the five kings that were taking captive type that type amen you have five senses in your flesh the flesh man these were people that were governed by the flesh man amen and the four Hors Powers were able to take them over because all they had was their five senses all they had was to walk in the flesh they didn't have the spirit man to rule them and Reign them so they were taken captive so not even lot's Kings could save him so their own preachers in the denomination cannot save them they themselves are taking captive they themselves have been deceived by the first horse rider they themselves have been taken amen by all of these horse riders amen so their only hope is US amen amen amen see there's different reasons for preaching the gospel one is to find the predestinated see the last elected one that's the bride right we know that and many many of the times you know when we go for outre we say yeah we're looking for that predestinated seed but that should not be the only goal of Outreach because that's only the first goal of Outreach the second goal is to preach to those that Lo that are lost in prison now and the third goal is to save the people that are not meant to be bried but to save them from hell those are your three objectives for doing outrage amen amen I just want to skip some stuff cuz see time is going amen but you're getting the just of the message tonight amen hallelujah the prophet says then when we pray we must have the token to present with our prayers as I said and now believe for ourselves and apply the token amen so we believe for ourselves and apply the token then apply the token to the whole family like in Egypt Jericho and acts 16:31 we find out that Paul told the Romans and children say believe thou and all thy household shall be saved apply to your family now here's the prophet saying apply the token to your family if you got an unsaved child lay the token right on top of him amen Lord God I claim him and stay right there amen say Lord I claim my loved ones and stay right there if you got a mother or a loved one that's lost lay the to token on them and say Lord I claim it move out now now don't just claim them read the next pass the next part move out all the worldly trash out of the house get rid of it burn up your shorts throw your C tables away because all of these things if you want to say you claiming them but you going to be a stumbling block to them then you're not saving them you're being a stumbling block to them amen amen we say we live in the message we got to show them that the message has high standards we got to show them that we have not let down the bars because then they can see the Life of Christ in us and then that to them will be not a stumbling block but a stepping stone for them to climb up amen then you're getting ready then apply the token in prayer with real evidence real Faith amen you read the quote that Sister Kim put on the group today real Faith amen not just any any old Faith amen but real Faith amen applied with confidence when you apply the token amen hallelujah so amen we see that Abraham had to fight amen now amen we focused Amen on Abraham saving lot but not only that Abraham also had to fight these Kings as a type of us having to defeat these Kings ourself in our own lives we have to defeat the Flesh in our own lives amen we have to defeat every demonic power that comes against us as well and only then when we are victorious as well in our own life then we can go and meet the Lord and have communion with him the prophet said when we overcome our battles yes when we are victorious amen amen then we too will meet the Lord see many times we want to have communion we have fellowship with God we know communion is fellowship with God communicating with God yes and we want to have fellowship with God but we have not overcome the flesh man amen we still held captive in the flesh so how can we commune with God because what does what Fellowship has light with Darkness amen and the bread and wine types the word and Revelation yes you see we want the Deep Revelations of the word but we have to defeat the flesh man amen before we come to that otherwise the word that you receive will just be head knowledge to you amen amen you'll have no power behind it because the flesh will be bound now what if Abraham was himself held captive by these Kings can you imagine if these Kings took Abraham captive how was he going to be able to rescue lot if he himself was captive see lot's salvation was based on Abraham being in a position of strength in Abraham was in mamre a position of strength a position of fatness lot lot salvation was dependent on Abraham being in a position of strength because then Abraham could go and deliver him if Abraham himself was captive lot's Hope was gone you see so if you are captive by the things of the world and the flesh is dominating your spirit man how are you going to save the Lost how is your loved ones even going to have a chance if you yourself in the message are not being a conqueror and not being Victorious yes amen if you are not coming to that right position your loved ones are lost there's no hope for them amen so you see why being a Christian is not only for ourselves it's to live for others amen we have to reach our position and overcome not only for our own benefit but it's for the benefit of others amen it does not even the bible say that even nature itself is waiting for us even nature is depending on us coming into our position even those in the sixth Dimension are waiting for us so you see being a Christian is not just about ourselves there's a whole lot of people that are waiting upon us so that is why as a Christian we got to get rid of The Selfish mindset amen we got to get rid of worrying about our own dreams our own Ambitions our own promotion you know only woring about the growth of our own immediate family amen you know that's not the life of a Christian the life of a Christian is living for others you see in the book of Acts he brought all the belongings and wealth to the disciples and he said distributed amongst the Believers they wasn't only focused on my wife my children now we know the prophet said communal living won't work in this age but I'm saying look at the character of a Christian amen we are not to be selfish we got to come to our position of strength so that we can be of benefit to others amen the Supernatural is not only for us it's for the benefit of others amen you see now I'm preparing us for when the squeeze comes because when the squeeze comes times we can't only focus on my wife my children amen we got to be there for each other in that time amen hallelujah we got to be real Christians then amen we got to not be selfish then amen so mzc amen King theing before the body change amen Abraham had to overcome these things hallelujah amen he never had a name change yet he never had a body change yet amen he never even come to the stage where he produced Isaac is yet you had to overcome the the flesh man you to overcome these Powers amen hallelujah amen I'm almost drawing to a close amen the prophet is perfect picture of Christ and the church the Holy Spirit leading the faithful that's born in the same house of the Holy Ghost where Christ was born pursuing after the Wayward and backslidden Hallelujah yes pursuing after the Wayward do you know what the word pursuing is amen it's a verb amen it's an action word it's going after them amen and now you know agent said we our ministry is to slay every Force every Power every evil and slaying every evil thing that's overcome them what's overcome them the four the the powers of the four horse riders have overcome them overcoming sin laying aside all the weights speaking to the people about their lust and the things that they're doing cut it off their sicknesses and all preaching to them the gospel and bringing them back into the fellowship of Goden amen last quote a very beautiful type of when the battle is over here on Earth the victories have been won Jesus said they would eat a new in the father's Kingdom Hallelujah after the waywood has been brought back then the first thing we do when we go in after the battle is over he sit down at the table in the kingdom of God Amen and there those that have fought now notice it's those that are fought yes if you have not fought you're not going to be there the prophet said it's all yours but you got to fight every inch of it yes amen and there those that has fought and sat down and overcome like Abraham was Overcomer shall be clothed in the righteousness of Christ and then again they take the bread and the wine in the father's Kingdom on the other side what a real picture this is of Abraham going out and getting lot and bringing him back amen so us he saying us being in that Kingdom and being clothed in Christ's righteousness and partaking of the communion is tied up with us saving lot am amen soen I pray that amen you've been blessed you get the just of the message a simple message but like I said the Lord want me to go any other if it was up to me I would like to preach something deep some deep mystery but the Lord didn't want me to go any other way but on this amen amen and you know I was I was like I told you I told my secretary if you only knew what's happening right now the angel of the Lord is coming in and out of this office and then when I was on my way to church I was you know thinking about this and I was thinking why why preach this message now you know it's just a simple message that people know this why preach it now and then my thought went to what who who is Abraham's people it's Israel right natural Israel and what's happening in Israel now is that they at War and notice they've been a portion of the people have been captured and taken into Gaza yes they've kidnapped them and take them and who did they kidnap it was those close to the Border they were currently in a rave party in a Sodom condition and lot was in a lot was a Jew Lord was Abraham's people in a Sodom condition he was in and they came and captured them and took them and what the natural types the spiritual so if we see nine Israel that these people have been captured and taken is a type of how our loved ones have been captured Amen in the spiritual yes but it's up to us Amen to claim them back the prophet says we are entitled to claim them back we are entitled to apply the token and claim them amen sister at could have asked for anything the prophet said she could have asked for the healing of her of her sister she could have asked for money the prophet said but she is concerned about the salvation of her two boys now you with the same power in the third pole the power to speak the word what are you doing with it amen amen to him whom much is given much is required amen overcoming amen the powers that beat these four horse riders ourselves and rescuing Lord from them before we have communion again with the Lord amen hallelujah let's stand amen amen Blessed Be Your Name blessed be your name oh god oh Lord we worship you Lord than you Lord let us not be selfish Lord in the message oh God God what a glorious message oh God a message of Life a message Lord that can give life Lord Jesus thank you Jes oh Lord help us oh God to do what you've instructed us not only in the first part of redemption when you left the disciples and you said go into the world and preach the gospel but now even in the second part of redemption when John taken the book and eat the book and become the book and now you said unto John go and preach go and prophesy again to Every Nation Kindred and tongue Lord let us not just stay with the within the confines of this comfort zone oh Lord let us us realize oh God that what you have given us and and the place that you have put us in to be a queen in this hour is not only for ourselves to enjoy the benefits of it but it's for the preservation of life amen just like how Esther was put there for the preservation of Life Lord oh God we pray Lord Jesus for our loved ones oh Lord father many of our loved ones are not saved Lord many of our loved ones are not even in the message Lord many of them are not even sometimes Christian oh god oh stuck in Hinduism and all kinds of religions and those stuck in denominations oh God but Lord we are thought Lord by your Prophet that we are entitled to claim them like your Prophet said one day in prayer he said like David I'm coming with a little slingshot of Faith amen and I'm coming to slay that enemy that has our my family members bound I'm coming to defeat every enemy that has our loved ones bound and we are claiming them back for the household of faith we are claiming them back for the kingdom of Goden oh Lord father and not only that Lord let us ourselves father overcome the kings of the flesh let us overcome these powers that are reigning Lord these four horse powers Lord and now they are Amalgamated in this last fourth horse rider of death oh Hallelujah and that fourth horse rider oh God is is going about like a roaring lion but he's not a lion he's just going about acting but we have the lion of the tribe of Judah oh we have the ox anointing we have the man anointing we have the eagle anointing oh god oh that can combat these forces of Darkness oh God and we thank you Lord Jesus for your goodness Lord oh we know Lord that you have spoken to us tonight Lord help us not to be like that servant oh God who was lazy let us not be a lazy servant oh God let us oh God gain inheritance and interest oh God in what you have given us let us give you back interest Lord if you have given us this message let us be able to say Lord this is what we give you in return oh god oh Lord because one day father we will come before you Lord and Lord when everyone is laying down their crowns before you we can only lay a crown before you if we have a crown to lay and Lord what are going to be the crowns on our head is those that we have led to Christ those things that we have done for Christ because everything else will fade away but only What's Done For Christ will last oh Lord Jesus we love you and worship you oh God blessed be your name thank praise be to your name in Jesus name thank amen huah amen
