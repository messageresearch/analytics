Sunday 23rd of July to cater for the visiting Pastor that's here so remember the combined meeting will be next week Sunday the 23rd of July at Durban girls secondary school at 4 pm how many of you are blessed the meeting on Wednesday amen amen amen and I believe the Lord has more in store for us hallelujah you think God is depleted and dry no God has more in so of us amen at the time that you can't fool us out anymore is when we are full of ourselves and full to the breath then he can't fill us so even this morning say Lord I'm emptying out right now everything I know everything I Am Lord I'm emptying out so come and fill me this morning amen praise the Lord amen let's turn to Hebrews chapter 11 amen I want to start speaking on faith again it is the most vital most important thing that we need in this life amen a Christian Life cannot be lived without faith [Music] if it's a life lived without faith it's a faith fake life fake Christian Life coming to church amen and doing things out of religion and it's all fake the things of God must be believed by faith everything is faith amen doesn't the Bible says we walk by faith and not by sight amen Hallelujah let's read our scripture and then we can be seated amen and then we'll get into the message Hallelujah everybody love the Lord amen he's worthy to be praised Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1 reads now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it what's the it Faith the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made by of we're not made of things which do appear amen Lord of blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated hallelujah amen praise the Lord Hallelujah the prophet in the message faith is is the first message he ever preached says this it's the first message he says I think real true Ministers of the Gospel now we have many ministers now I remember when I'm speaking I'm speaking within the framework of the message amen that's who we concern ourselves with yeah the days of telling you that denominations are wrong and we are right are over amen amen we need to do introspection we need to bring ourselves into a service and do spiritual Diagnostics I think real true ministers of the Gospel not our own ambition not our own kingdom of what the gospel we got too many people with their own ambition with their own purpose and they have forgotten the kingdom of God they've forgotten about the gospel yes amen I think real true Ministers of the Gospel ought to be up and go and go ought to be giving the people the right things amen amen and what he says meet in due season and this is the first message imagine in 65 we know he preaches spiritual food in due season but this is the first message and he's calling Faith the meat in due season amen amen thank you amen if we go to verse 6 of that chapter brother uh in verse chapter 11. verse 6. we'll find there that faith is being described even further that without faith it is impossible man yeah to please him now Christian Life we ought to be pleasing the Lord it doesn't say Without Love it doesn't say without sacrifice without works without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is amen an easy rewarder of them that diligently seek him amen amen now we got too many people that are pursuing their own desires on the earth when I'm saying too many amongst us we are pursuing the lust of the flesh when I'm saying lust to the flesh we are pursuing material things in this life with such a passion and a purpose and we are achieving those things but those things you cannot enable the kingdom of God those things will make you comfortable in this life for a season but you are really living a defeated powerless life based on your own strength amen so without faith it is impossible to please God you say brother should not be pursuing a better house a better thing that's your own fleshly desire God has a better house for you for you God has a better car for you and I'm talking about the little things right now but because you went and did it your way you have settled for your house and your car hear me now yes but the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom amen and then all these other things will be added to you when somebody is born into your house that's your kingdom don't you as the father and mother seek the best interest of the child and give them everything even things they don't ask for amen so it's the same way in the kingdom of God we seek his kingdom what does the Bible say to him that diligently seek him how diligent are we how diligently are we seeking him now we got a 24-hour day right how much of time do we spend in that day speaking the word of God Amen no literally now come on when I'm talking about the word of God this is the word of God everybody familiar with this it's called The Holy Bible how much of this is coming out of our mouth let's be honest amen let's record our conversations in a day yes how much of that is coming out of our mouths yes all right maybe you see why we got to reprogram ourselves we speak a lot of other things but we don't speak the word of God because faith is based on what foreign faith is based on the word of God and if you believe that the prophets are the principle or the primary basis for God revealing his word or is the prophet secondary the primary is the word of God I got a quote for that some of you look at me shocked because I know why you do that because you've been programmed with a message that even if you don't understand something the prophet said you believe the prophet's word even if you made a mistake you'll believe the prophet's word over the Bible true come on now you've seen it happen the prophet remind me by the slip of the time you see the impression and answers yeah they started to question the prophet was it really that instead of this he said 700 instead of seven thousand they were prepared to believe that come on now yes the prophet will not reveal anything outside of the word amen if he's a true scriptural prophet what am I trying to tell you that faith is based on the word of God the word of God is our absolute did the bible say that heavens and earth will pass away but my prophets will never pass away water will never pass away the word of God will never pass away amen so the word must be the absolute in our life to live a life without faith is to use live a hopeless life hopeless to live a life without faith is to live a hopeless life amen based on the senses of the body how we feel what we see and most of the time we speak how we feel and what we see you know the most dangerous question you can ask somebody how are you today you are opening up the amounts of Prophecy sure I'm serious now you are opening up their mouths of Prophecy because as soon as they speak they start to speak the negative I'm feeling down I'm feeling this hey this is not right that is not right my back he saw my lung he saw my chest he saw sugar diabetes arthritis what's happening to us we are prophesying over ourselves our words are going and creating the atmosphere around us amen I tell a lot of people that I know are sick the first thing I tell them you're looking good you're looking well I'm feeling so bad this guy is telling me but it makes them feel good I'm with you when you're sick you look you feel me how do you feel better when they tell you you look terrible nobody amen so there's so much of negativity in this world because that's how Satan designed the world yes I'm gonna go slow and I'm going to take this in stages because we need to teach the people amen amen we have the opening of the world but all of that came for a purpose if you think of the end result of the opening of the word is to give us perfect faith rapturing faith amen faith When Faith is perfected so I'm going to say this way when with my vision for you as your pastor is that when we are done with you according to Ephesians 4 the only thing you must be missing is the new body amen amen amen Yes sounds good the only thing you should be short of is the new body [Music] oh thank you amen so if you ask me what's my vision that's my vision for you be so full of the word so equipped through the word amen yes no matter how you feel speak the word so full of the words who empowered by the word that the only thing you are short of is the new body not even sicknesses resigning in your body yes when I'm saying sicknesses I'm talking about all manner of sicknesses I am coming with a spotlight this morning and I'm asking you what are the conditions that you've been living with amen yes thank you sisters suffering with skin problems acne they call it trying all kinds of medication things we got accustomed to living with high blood pressure sugar diabetes arthritis back problems this that and the other that should not exist in your body amen amen amen thank you we've gotten too soft too comfortable when God gave us his word yes amen glory be to his name thank you Lord amen so there's so much of negativity in this world amen much more than positivity amen because this is a foreign world amen and it's based on negativity and fear because that's how Satan designed it you know we just come through this man called right what did you think it do to the rest of the world the same world no well they're all insane but the straight people it dropped panic and fail to them they didn't drive faith into them look at what they're trying to do teach our kids this this Panic fear Panic fear everything is designed for a purpose amen that is how Satan designed Eden by doubt and reasoning and in the Garden of Eden they were singing that song So pass it on so pass it on to everyone passing the blame from this person to that person to this person who did Adam blame who did he blame everything he passed it on pass it on to everyone amen so to live a life In the Flesh and to cater for the flesh we will live defeated lives in the spirit amen and we cannot please God In the Flesh so the Christian Life is a supernatural life the Christian life amen and in order to walk in this world the way we contact it is through faith if we want to tap into that Supernatural world right now the only way you can contact it is through faith we know what the prophets that faith is the sixth sense right amen now if I break this down and I tell you if you put up Hebrews 11 there let's just take this first verse amen when you leave here you must at least understand this first verse so what is faith if I had to ask you what is faith what is faith anybody yes complete Trust or confidence in someone or something that's the definition of faith we'll go through this Bible definition of Faith now but what is the definition of faith complete Trust in someone now we don't have just anyone we have the one complete trust and confidence in D1 yeah that's two things someone or something but we do have something as well it's the word of God you say the word is not a thing when you call someone and tell them uh come here I want to tell you something what are you telling them don't you call them and say come here I want to tell you something you tell do you speak like that so it's the word a thing nobody is agreeing with me I want to tell you something is the word a thing the word is a thing so look at the definition of faith itself we are complete trust in the creature of heavens and the Earth and confidence in his word now Faith is the substance so complete confidence right faith if that's what we need right and if you would want to produce Faith within you then the disciples say increase our faith so faith is what we need but you can produce faith Fred coming by then yeah sharing of the word but not hearing alone I can hear the word all day and all night I can hear the word I can hear the word constantly but something was sick much in my heart it was simple because doesn't the prophecy hearing recognizing acting acting yeah so when you put your faith into action you start to speak and you believe you move faith in action amen amen that's what's producing that faith faith right Hallelujah so faith is the substance now if I'm going to break that down for you I'm going to tell you the substance is the raw material right of things hopeful what is Hope hope is your desire hope is your thoughts hope is your imagination so you must in order for Faith to be the substance to get what you hope for what you desire what you will your thoughts faith is going to be the raw material that produces that and brings the evidence of Things Not Seen amen let me explain to you this Pulpit what is the raw material of the spirit so what is the substance is with the substance of the pulpit yes right what is the substance of the spirit so faith is the substance needed for the healing of your body faith is a substance amen that's going to be used to bring to pass that which you desire amen amen yes watch it in the Unseen you're going to use Faith as the substance to bring it into the scene world Amen now brother Jaden can you go to that uh to my the study there on the study you'll see water there can you bring the water for me amen praise the Lord I'm not feeling thirsty I'm showing you an example my watch is in the room I know it's there I am afraid to believe it's there but as long as I stay quiet about it and I didn't speak to someone you didn't see the water there but my faith and confidence knowing that whether Jaden is obedient brought the water to the scene world and I was so thirsty but I left it there for the example amen I don't know if you knew the water was on the table none of you what brought it my faith and confidence to ask someone to go and get the something I brought it into the scene world amen hope you're understanding them faith is the substance faith is the raw material amen faith is the word and the more wood you have the more chairs you can make you can make whatever is in your imagination but if you have no imagination if you have no hope if you have no vision you do nothing with the Wind amen do I need to explain the other part if you have no vision if you have no thought if you have no immense desire for the things of God for bringing to pass in your life what God has laid in his word faith will lay dormant you can have all the wood all the substance being created but Faith Lays dormants free not in action amen Hallelujah so if you want to make a chair where does the chair exist in your thoughts now this is true if you're thinking about the message then the bible say that God existed in the beginning with his thoughts he was alone with this thoughts so everything as long as it remains in your thoughts nothing will happen yeah even you were in the mind of God but unless God got into action amen and he began to believe his own word but Mark 11. amen 23 24 there unless you believe your own word then you can use the substance to create to change your life yeah yeah to heal your body yes faith in what the word of God the scriptures are there by his wounds we were here amen glory be to his name so can if I had a log here Candlewood transform itself into a chair what is needed what is required someone with imagination someone with vision someone with purpose to take that wit the substance and watch it work it yeah work according to the laws of woodworking put it on a lake shape it up get a saw cut it up get your pieces together someone amen with an imagination think of Amen Michelangelo when he when he had a sculpture in his mind and now he's shipping away at the raw material until he chipped away every unnecessary part and only the necessary Parts remained amen so what is in your mind becomes evident in the chair amen without words you see the one the Bible says now I'm trying to bring James into life Elijah now by these practical examples faith without words is there amen so the substance itself all the wind itself without works that he's dead now notice I'm breaching it in a way that even the young people will understand this morning amen why we are building we have a vision because the same faith that you see now in seed form Mustard Seed Faith is the same fate when it's perfected he's going to change your body you can use the same substance faith to change the body yes amen so faith without words is dead amen faith without imagination is dead so what does faith need Faith needs your thoughts to come to life thoughts of healing thoughts of Peace amen thought over your problems thoughts over your circumstance based on the word of God amen so Faith so here is what Jesus said whatsoever things you desire whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them and you shall have them amen amen now what is he saying that let's go back one verse 23 whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed so you need to tell it what to do two things here in the scripture what to do and where to go tell your problem tell your situation what to do and where to go be not removed because they need instructions did the pigs need the devils in the pigs need instruction tell us what to do where to go be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe those things which he said like what the Lord did now we made in His image and likeness believe your own words what you say shall come to pass and he shall have whatsoever he said then we go to the next verse whatever things you desire When you pray now I don't know if anyone who goes to the Lord and prays Lord I'm sick he said how he's asking you to pray you pray what you desire stop telling the Lord oh Lord my husband is so irritating speak what you desire speak what you want is is that word their desire limited to spiritual Geniuses in the message will confine you and and say don't ask for all those things bro whatsoever you desire so if you come against his intellectual John celebrate my desire not your desire leave me alone with my desire amen you don't have a vision for it I have a vision for you yeah right so leave me alone when my desire the Bible is here personally talking to me whatsoever you desire if you desire to be a structured it's fine amen glory be to his name amen so faith is the substance faith is the raw material to bring the Unseen into the same world that's what I'm speaking about this morning faith is the raw material that brings the Unseen into the same world you're gonna do it by your faith amen glory be to his name amen amen so let me just go to some amen glory be to his name Hallelujah let's start to Romans 10 9. amen these are the scriptures I need you to take down and memorize because these are the principles of faith let's go one verse above this to get context the word is near where in my bookshelf the word is near even in that car the word is near even in your mother's lips your father's lips the word is that mouth and in that Hearts so two places in thy mouth and in your heart what is what what is this now any word what word of faith are we speaking about faith this morning is that the raw material is the word producing Faith according to what we understand Faith cometh by hearing we speak only the word of faith which we preach right that if thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus now we've had too many people come to Christ without a confession because it's not been taught for you it's not necessary you can think it does the Bible say think you that are babes in Christ that are coming into Christ now you need to do this confess with my mouth that means audibly yeah confess with your mouth confess With Thine mouth the Lord Jesus and thou shalt believe in thine heart so this is in line now with that verse before two places mouth and heart right confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in that heart that God had raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved amen now I'm not too much for people who don't understand what the prophet preached because the prophet says the Bible says whosoever believeth on the Lord shall and confess we shall be saved the prophet says that word believe means to understand he says to understand because he says you preach the gospel on the street you're a drunk man there and you ask him hey you believe he said yeah I believe Now watch how they take this one quote and they destroy the scripture they take the quote where brother Branham speaking to Billy Paul and asking Billy Paul did you believe did you understand did you understand and then the prophet says it's not important you understand it's important you believe but the same Prophet when he's explaining the scripture tells you believe means understand why were Seven Seals revealed if we were not supposed to understand it you think God is an author of confusion no no I will hide my word for 2 000 years I will send a Vindicated prophet and he will reveal the mysteries of God but you don't need to understand it then we preach that we have the mind of Christ and we know what he once done with the word how can you preach the mind of Christ nobody wants done with the word when you are saying nobody wants done what the word means you have an understanding of his thoughts of his mind his purpose in this hour amen Glory so every time you open your mouth and confess with your mouth and believe in your heart faith is the substance that is produced when you are saying by your wounds I am healed what are you doing you're producing the fruits for healing the substance for healing yes you're producing the sun you need Faith to bring it from The Unseen World to the scene world but there's so many different areas of your life right now I'm using sickness you need healing of the body but you need to speak the word the scriptures pertaining to Healing to produce the substance to bring healing to your body amen and it's only based on the word stop speaking our own words yeah yeah yes your words are useless yeah speak the word of God back to him amen and his word will not return void it's simple say Lord buy your own time here I claim it in the name of Jesus Lord I Thank You Lord you abundant for my transgressions your proves to my iniquities the chastisement of my peace was upon you and by your stripes I am healed speak the word back to him amen you have need of something else whatever it is amen whatever area in your life now you're lacking say Lord find the scripture and apply the scripture only speak the scripture back God cannot ignore his own word that's right amen so when you got a substance you got to have a desire if you have no hope you have no desire faith is the substance of things before things in your thoughts things in your mind things that you desire like I said if you leave the wood there it'll just remain wood if you leave the faith there you just remain dormant amen so faith is spiritual things of God Are Spiritual amen and faith is an invisible substance that has the power to change invisible imagination or thought into physical manifestation amen so if we had to get an architect to build a building for us amen and you know along the journey you get different people to work on the plans you're getting the guys to maybe excavate the land then you get in the builders you're getting someone to dig the trenches you're getting someone to the bricklayers different people are coming along then you're getting Maybe the club is going to laugh at me now if I go further in details here but let's just say maybe we go I don't know do we do electrical last after that was his birth yeah right here I'm learning quickly yeah so maybe you put the roof and roof and swing and everything and I'll be putting the electricals in as long as everyone that comes in sticks to the blueprint yeah yeah do you have to have any doubts in your heart if everyone sticks to the blueprint do you gonna be stressing out and the plans are going to be passed now the building inspector is coming are you going to be sitting there biting your teeth or you're going to have the confidence that this house is built 100 correct that is why God sent a fight for Ministry to build the body of Christ and you've got to have confidence in each one of them that they're doing amen the perfect job according to the blueprint so that you can be confident that your house is being built perfect that's why it's important for you to have the right teaching the right person amen otherwise you'll be like a ship without a sale you'll be like on shaking Foundation amen hallelujah so if each one sticks to the drawing each one sticks to the plan Amen on the day when the when you are really Amen to see the house maybe you've been keeping it a secret from the wife you'll have confidence come the house plans are passed and you bring and you show her the house beautiful design well furnished now please get her advice when you're Furnishing amen hallelujah glory be to his name amen [Music] now we are talking [Music] right speaking to the mountain you gotta have faith that the mountains will move even if it's moving one grain at it one grain of sand at a time right so there was this pasta and he had a humble Ministry simple Ministry a few people amen and the church began to grow because when the works of God are being performed and miracles and healings are taking place generally people come for the healing for the miracle but remember that's an attraction yeah for the gospel that should never stop Jesus said I will make you fishes of men did they send them with the word only right so you are the modern day disciples God is equipped you with the power Mark 16 you ought to be in operation in you yes people have made the mistake that Mark 16 is an operation only in the fivefold ministry Mark 16 is your scripture that these friends shall follow them that believe amen all of us are believers amen so when you see somebody sick you take the word and you apply it same thing Faith the substance you take the substance faith in the word of God you go there to that person and you say according to the substance according to the word of God he finally ends upon you you shall be healed amen amen who are you calling me disciple I'm asking you again I'm not sure what do you speak amen how much of the word do you speak somebody tell you you're sick don't go for your favorite recipe hey I got this concoction go to the word of God we are people of faith we need to show the world that we believe in Jesus Christ we need to show that Jesus Christ in flesh again yes amen somebody sick best doctor recommendation best practitioner business I don't want to be a practitioner of medicine I want to be a practitioner of faith how many of you feel that way amen if anyone wants to know the faith who must they come to if anyone wants to know about the Holy Ghost who must they come to me if anyone wants to know about the things of God about the love of God about the joy of God who must they come to amen you are to be the source yeah the fountain they must run a desire to come to you oh you know what if I only said get to that person amen if I can only get to that person you are Jesus we need the gospel with skin on it yeah not in word only but the word must become flesh amen is that the only thing you know for the last since the prophet went very few people and you'll bear me witness now demons don't worry anyone in the message very few because Mark 16 has become non-existent put up Mark 16. people don't have faith anymore they don't have confidence in that scripture you know why they're living such shallow lives the only thing coming out of their mouth is what Netflix this movie that movie hey talking about soccer talking about this play we bought this play we bought that player some of you come to church once a month that's the only time you hear the word of God for one hour two hours the most the word of God is non-existent in your life and sometimes we need to get along with God when I'm saying along with God have your quiet time with the Lord and when you have your quiet time with the Lord you know what you need to do keep quiet amen stop being so full of yourself let him speak back to you amen amen some people like to ease our conscience we don't really spend time with God or the things of God so we have it playing in the background right we don't really have that meditation with the Lord we think now you can listen you can I can put you in a room and let you play the message tape the whole day it will do nothing for you unless you are listening hear that at the gear let him hear what the spirit is saying yeah yes does it say listen what the voice listen what the spirit is saying amen amen but the spirit is speaking through the voice amen so I was telling you about this Minister the church started to grow and probably similar to our situation yeah the parking was the only space they could use to extend so he decided to extend the church and add more and more miracles were taking place what do you think they needed to do extend the church more see I'm giving you a vision now amen amen if you don't have confidence to pray for the sick and heal the sick you tell your neighbor come to church we have men of God did that to pray for you amen and you shall be healed yeah don't let us come there in the open and then tell them come to church yeah let them hear the word of God you see we have thought that the the gospel is has evolved to a thing and it's only for us believers the gospel is for the preaching of the Lost to the preaching of the laws to show the power of God yeah amen and maybe you don't have confidence start to build your confidence tell them you've tried so many things why don't you come this side shall follow them that believe if they lay hands upon the sick they shall recover they here I was telling you about the devils in my name the shakunts are devils very few devils are being cast out in the message right people are living with unbelief demon powers you know what they are intellectual Giants they say I rather live in with that one devil because I know this fella is not going to make his life right and if a Caster than one devil he won't accept the Holy Ghost so seven was Devils will come upon him so I rather leave him with the one devil that's people's thinking they are using the word of God for their own devices I can handle one devil how am I going to handle it it does become eight because the Bible says the one that left called seven others and say look that house is left unclean I mean swept clean no Holy Spirit fill them let us go position that Tabernacle casting out there amen take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen amen amen so what happened was there was no more space in the parking so they need a parking now and the first people that were in the church the the founders the Elders of the church so I started to feel hey you know what Pastor forgot us now the church is Big we've got no space But even we come late you know the the people that's long in the church would think they've got special privileges come late to church so these people who are like that amen I need the Deacon to stand at the door on a Sunday and Wednesday and take the name of late comes did they do it in school hello did they do it in school so repeat your offenders they put them in the book and what do you think they tell them to do they must stay after school for what they call it so we can have detention class it can't be they're becoming like this so let's fix those things let's get it right let's move on right amen so what they saw now the only place they had to build a parking was this mountain behind the church amen so there was a quarrel and an argument going on and they said are we going to move that mountain the pastor says next service we are going to come and pray and we're going to pray for the mountain to move how many people you think showed up very few you see like I'll

what I said shall come to pass amen I can help what I said hallelujah amen so everybody knew now that the praying meeting took place to becoming church Sunday and they're running first thing where behind the church to see if the mountain is still there and the mountain is still there right the mountain is still there but he had to maintain a positive confession he had to still maintain it because the word of God Falls from his mouth amen yes amen it will not return void you see what the problem is without the word of God if you spoke it stand there and watch it come back yes amen so the people that you know kind of people start to laugh at the past he said hey the mountains will move see the mountains still there and we still got no parking we're parking on the road yet some people like to park on the road I don't mean that you know these guys like to hang around so Sunday service no change amen so when praise don't get answered what happens people start gossiping people start gossiping amen about the preacher but that didn't bother him he preached Faith amen he preached the mountains moving amen Monday morning he's sitting in his office knocked on the door building contractors they come to him this is a true story now they come to him and they say you know what we're building down the road here and there's a huge ditch we're building down we need sand to fill it up amen and we notice you got this mountain behind you and we want to come and excavator and use that sand to fill the placement building and not only that we're gonna pay you for it yeah amen amen you see God will use circumstances to move the mountain so they negotiated and he had a timeline so he when the negotiating powers in your hand he said how soon is this going to be done so he told them you know what we have more need of the sand than you so we are going to do it in this week we're sending the excavation team that's going to come and by next week Sunday we'll even do your

in verse 8. chapter 10 verse 8. in Revelation so we need 10 units amen you believe it yes amen amen hallelujah so they came amazed now Pastor yes we believe now the mountain moved but the pastor not only did they have the mountain move they also got paid for the mountain amen so that's how God can work in our lives amen hallelujah the kingdom of God is about reaping and sowing and reaping anything the principles in the kingdom of God you so doubt you'll read doubt you sow Faith you read Faith amen amen whatever you sow you shall read you sure so negativity you'll reap negativity whatever you saw that's a principle in the kingdom of God you are going to read them so you what is obstructing your faith is your negative confession your negative words is diluting the substance faith is the substance faith is the raw material but now you know they used to use genuine stuff before but now China got involved and they make synthetic stuff it's like the original but it's not so don't let your faith be synthetic let your faith be original amen hallelujah amen so when we speak the word of faith it's not your job to doubt it it's your job to believe it amen what does the Bible say one of us can put a thousand to flight but what can two of us do he said the legion fleeing does the Bible say when two or more are gathered together in my name yes powerful if one can do so much what can do to do when they agree if you shall agree upon touching anything you shall have what you say amen so from now on you are going to have your thoughts your imagination based on the word of God and you're going to bring it to life amen unless you dream unless you have a vision you are going to perish I have a vision for your soul I have a vision for yourself I have a vision for your family I have a vision that not one of them is lost and let Faith go to work let Faith be the substance amen that produces it and brings it into the same world how do you produce it Romans 10 9 speak them out believe in your heart speak with your mouth believe in your heart nothing nothing speak the word I was preaching amen about amen about tearing down Satan's kingdom causing war and Devastation and I was showing you how speaking the word causes war and Devastation in the Kingdom of Satan amen don't be idle speak the word of God eat the word of God you've got nothing to do say a scripture amen amen open up the Bible memorize a verse speak the scripture throw poems into heaven and into Satan's kingdom amen [Music] speak the word amen John where where did the word go into the mouth speak the word amen hallelujah praise be to the Lord amen now I'm going to give you an example of another pastor this pasta very poor Church in India amen so you know when the church is small and the past is full time and the tides are small it's not easy for the pastor to live right especially if they're living off that so he didn't even have his table and a chair to put in the office of the church and he says what on foot and come to church and he was telling the Lord I need to get a table and chairs so at least I can sit here and I also need a bicycle so that I can come to church and if somebody is sick call in need again travel a bit faster on the bicycle and get to them so you use Mark 11 23 Behold a man if you say to this mountain be that I'll move custom to the Sea don't doubt in your heart believe those things which you said shall come to pass amen now notice the scripture says believe whatever you said shall come to pass now whatever you said you shall have it I mean if you believe that whatever you say you shall have it so what happens now if you say you know I've got the most rude boss I got the most terrible boss what are you speaking are you speaking what you see or do you want to speak what's you want to see this is the way most of us are we speak them I got this boss and he's like this he's like this constantly is like this like this like this we even go to God and tell him about our boss but we never tell God our desire what we want how we want you to change yes you know we should be going Lord I Thank you that I have the most wonderful boss no even your body will start to think hey what's wrong with this film he's lying to God no you are speaking what you desire Lord I Thank you I have the most wonderful boss Lord and thank you Lord that he's coming to me and ask me if I need an increase Lord I Thank You Lord speak what you want speak what you desire I thank you Lord that there are no tire kickers in the dealership practical okay I thank you Lord than every one of them he's not wasting my time but they are coming to buy amen Hallelujah brother pray for me I got this this this what are you saying what are you confessing amen whatever you say you are saying but go and praise God praise God say to the thing what to do where to go I'm declaring this I am set free I agree with you so what you should should you say brother this is what the doctor said not what I am saying this is what the doctor said but I am saying unto you that 1 Peter 2 24 says by his wounds I am healed then the brother says yes I agree with you now two I agree touching that thing you shall receive it amen therefore things whatsoever you desire next one 24. whatsoever things you desire you know what that is blankship hello it's a blank check whatsoever thinks you desire is a blank shape amen hallelujah given by Jesus signed by Jesus Blanchard given to you the believer whatsoever you desire will this check bounce whatever you desire When you pray did he say speak your buttons speak your problems did he say speak your sickness he said speak your desire and when you come to Jesus like this amen we come to Jesus and we talk about our desires I know it's simple I know it's plain but that's how Jesus taught Jesus taught in parables so when we come to Jesus we talk to Jesus about our desires amen yes and the prophet says that many times Jesus will talk back to me and if my desire is not in line with his word he will tell me why you can't bring that to pass like how you talk to your children and tell them why you can't Jesus does the same with us but he's not telling you shut your desires and don't tell me your desires whatsoever you desire come talk to me come let us reason amen so the Pastor said Lord I believe amen now when you believe that listen to me now I'm going to close doesn't matter maybe didn't touch a lot of the message a lot of the sermon it's fine the main thing is are you learning because this thing must be applied yes so you got a week to apply it and then you learn new principles amen we need to start applying these things yes I told you the only thing you should be short of is the new body you should be the Disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ wherever you go yeah circumstance and situations arise in your way you are the disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ you take authority over that situation hmm But read James how the Lord presents trials Temptations to perfect your faith and also to produce patience then he says my patience is he's perfected in you then it brings forth the product right sorry the Lord tells him okay you prayed this prayer I want you to go before the people and confess him thank me start thanking me for it so he goes in the congregation and he starts preaching and he tells the people I want to tell you people something God has blessed me with a new bicycle a new chair and a new desk amen amen and not only that he's gonna give me this bread no bicycle so you're specific so everybody hallelujah what did he say he didn't say the Lord is going to bless me he told him the Lord has blessed me the Lord God has given me the time of a teacher I am healed by his rules we were healed past tense how many of you know there's something about faith the Bible says faith cometh by the hearing can you find the scripture Faith cometh by what hearing how many of you know what verb what chance is coming it's covered a past tense a present tense or your future tense Faith cometh by the hearing you're right brother Ramesh it's constantly coming incumbent incumbent it's like that

said I thank the Lord that he's given me a new chair new desk and a new bicycle so everyone is slapping that praise the Lord hallelujah now the Youth of the church very smart people they were going to pack the instruments like how we got here so they go peep in the office and they say no this no chair they go outside they see no bicycle there so they're coming in why this person told us he got all these things when the office is empty there's no chair no this no bicycle amen so they started to talk to him and he says I have spoken it according to Mark 11 23 and even though you don't see it faith is a substance the raw material that's going to pull it out of the Unseen World and bring it into the same world Amen so they start to say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus so they you they're excited to see it amen so children generally start to talk so they start to talk gossip and say this party was lying to our sister so the pro the person now is telling you Lord you know what you told me to go and confess it before the people now my name is gonna get uh black and Jay about all the neighboring Villages and things and you know then the wisdom of God comes upon him so he takes the children he takes the children back into office and you tell them can you see the chair can you see the disc so they say no Apostle we can't see it and they're wondering how he can see it and then he told them when your mother was pregnant she couldn't see you she couldn't see you inside but you could feel something growing inside of her amen hallelujah your mother could not see you it's the same
