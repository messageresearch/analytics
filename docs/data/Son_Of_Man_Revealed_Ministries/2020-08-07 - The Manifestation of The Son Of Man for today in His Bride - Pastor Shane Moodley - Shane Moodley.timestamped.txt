[26:27] thank you now we are working that
[26:29] rapturing faith it was in a mighty Bhima
[26:48] for Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[26:52] we went attend to our Bibles to the book
[26:55] of first Peter one where's Trinity
[27:07] yeah the Bible tells us that seeing you
[27:11] have purified your souls in obeying the
[27:15] truth through the spirit and two unsaved
[27:18] loved
[27:20] see that you love one another with a
[27:23] pure heart in February my beautiful
[27:28] reverently he we know in that in the age
[27:31] that the Prophet was speaking about the
[27:35] desire the desire of serving God right
[27:39] and he says a Fablab desire to please
[27:43] God
[27:44] a cry to reach out in the spirit and the
[27:49] passion to know his word let's dim down
[27:53] in that age but we see here now
[27:56] Pyrrhus bringing something to to note
[27:58] and this age here see that you love one
[28:02] another with a pure heart
[28:03] seventy verse 23 being born again not of
[28:08] corruptible seed but of incorruptible
[28:11] seed in them by the Word of God which
[28:16] liveth and abideth the Lord is blessing
[28:20] the meaning of this word as we want to
[28:23] speak upon the manifestation of the son
[28:25] of man today in his bride a man we come
[28:29] and we variety of sermons I believe 1124
[28:36] sermons that the Prophet is brought to
[28:39] us in this day and in this age and
[28:41] various books some you know like
[28:44] adoption church ages and the revelation
[28:47] of the same interior now we got into
[28:50] this the the understanding that God has
[28:54] sent a prophet now we know that it
[28:58] fulfills certain scriptural notations in
[29:01] the Bible for example Amos 3 verses 7
[29:04] insuring the Lord God will do nothing oh
[29:06] right then we find revelation 10 7
[29:10] but in the days of the voice of the
[29:12] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[29:13] sound the mystery of God will be
[29:15] completed as is declared on three sevens
[29:18] the purpose here with me man now we are
[29:21] quite content with what we have read
[29:24] what we are seeing and the messages
[29:27] that's coming forth but now we've gone
[29:30] beyond them we've gone beyond the seen
[29:33] that now the manifestation of the Son of
[29:36] Man today is in his bright coming true
[29:43] take you in this day and age we know
[29:46] that it comes with three sons man son of
[29:53] man son of God son of David in between
[29:57] the son of God and Son of David he comes
[30:01] according to his own word look 30 min
[30:05] ago five transformation after coming in
[30:14] a way they don't have a spiritual
[30:16] revelation and understanding that the
[30:19] coming that what was reflection was a
[30:22] spirit and a were coming to quicken the
[30:25] brain that is culture Amen praise the
[30:28] Lord
[30:29] so therefore now we see that in the
[30:32] stage of a perfect man that reality we
[30:36] have faith virtue knowledge temperance
[30:38] patience godliness and brotherly
[30:41] kindness religion all these kind of
[30:43] these service manifested in the time now
[30:47] we had poured the first church age and
[30:49] yet the seven churches will have William
[30:52] Branham to the elevation churches and
[30:55] with me are you following me now we came
[30:58] to a point where we had brotherly
[31:01] kindness
[31:01] there are many religious groups that
[31:05] have brotherly kindness
[31:08] many religious groups they have
[31:11] brotherly kindness many Christian groups
[31:14] have brotherly kindness but we're
[31:16] looking at one aspect of the brother
[31:20] that will earmark and grant us higher
[31:23] into the spirit of the holy development
[31:26] the Holy Spirit into a touchstone
[31:29] ministry and the capstone ministry will
[31:33] be divine love and it takes perfect love
[31:37] to go out there can you say amen amen
[31:40] praise the Lord hallelujah now we come
[31:45] to the translation church age and we
[31:48] realize that brother Branham was called
[31:50] in this layered ASEAN church age and
[31:53] being a pro prophet he acted to certain
[31:57] things and when he was seven years old I
[32:00] need a maple tree or what the question
[32:03] don't drink don't smoke I have a work
[32:05] for you to do God has made a way for him
[32:14] that he could breathe is a variety of
[32:16] summer to quicken the driver all right
[32:21] you will be Church a marriage alone now
[32:24] he can't do his commission right in
[32:28] nineteen thirty two year honorable as
[32:30] John the Baptist fall on the first
[32:32] coming of Christ you were four on the
[32:34] second coming a mess Malachi 4 5 and 6
[32:38] like you with me but now let's go I'll
[32:41] just leave the mysterious card for now
[32:45] and the present bride into ministry and
[32:47] we go further in this million churches I
[32:52] want you to be very very sincere and
[32:58] observe what the Spirit is trying to say
[33:02] to you tonight nothing here we are
[33:05] coming to a conclusion he says as the
[33:09] eternal locust God was manifest in the
[33:12] Sun and in Jesus we are all the fullness
[33:15] of the Godhead body level and that
[33:18] eternal one was the father manifest
[33:21] inflation and thereby gave the title
[33:24] title of service even so we eternal in
[33:29] his thoughts
[33:31] in our turn detain the many member body
[33:35] come on our church every man many
[33:38] minutes broken watch see manifest in
[33:41] flesh and those eternal torch now
[33:44] manifest in flesh are the sons of God
[33:46] even as we absolutely so now we know
[33:53] that we were in his eternal right and we
[34:01] were sealed
[34:02] amen we were sealed so now and as as I
[34:08] say the seals there are many things
[34:11] pertaining to sealed in your motor
[34:14] vehicle you have a seal maybe for the
[34:16] help for the wheel or for the tip for
[34:18] the engine or whatever and if the oil
[34:20] eats you know it's a serious thing you
[34:22] go and repair it and get your carboy
[34:25] then you find also the seal problem was
[34:29] the the Challenger in the United States
[34:33] when they went up and everyone just were
[34:35] blown and they all died yeah why when
[34:40] they investigated over the period of
[34:42] time that there was a seal problem so
[34:46] now as I'm showing you this we were
[34:49] sealed and we were not released the only
[34:53] time that we could spiritually be
[34:56] released and discerning a man the power
[35:00] and Spirit of God the word Amen so when
[35:08] that spirit was released we came out and
[35:13] then the many spoken word seed bodies
[35:17] that are here tonight and in the
[35:21] comforts of the home throughout the
[35:22] world where the bride is big men
[35:25] Christian had a purpose and a hidden
[35:27] mystery that God wanted to make sure
[35:30] that it will come to its full attrition
[35:34] amen
[35:34] praise the Lord now friends we did not
[35:39] become seed by the rebirth amen that's
[35:42] what I'm trying to tell you that we will
[35:45] see and for your sake what for mourning
[36:01] the elect can be reborn because we will
[36:04] see is the reason we could be quickened
[36:07] a member there is a quickening power
[36:09] that is within you
[36:11] that will succumb to the spirit of our
[36:15] mighty God that will come in union under
[36:19] the influence of the Holy Ghost and
[36:23] could bring to pass those things that
[36:27] you needed me know I mean you will work
[36:30] your salvation with fear and trembling
[36:33] this is the hour that we have come can
[36:37] say Amen amen praise the Lord
[36:39] so now in Romans 8 verses 19 for the
[36:42] endless expectation of the creature
[36:46] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[36:51] sons of God we look in terms of the
[36:59] first church age in messenger oh he was
[37:05] such his name was Saul he was against
[37:09] the Christians right he did everything
[37:12] that he could give me I can suddenly one
[37:15] day as I was walking on the road to
[37:19] Damascus
[37:22] there was a blinding flash blinding
[37:25] light coming down Saul Saul why
[37:28] persecutest down a man who are down I am
[37:36] Jesus so he is conversion and seemingly
[37:46] we thought that this conversion was
[37:49] converting him to move in that realm but
[37:54] there was something there was something
[37:57] that he didn't know but God in His time
[38:02] made it known he was taught by the real
[38:06] the articles of God scriptures he must
[38:11] have thought well you know all these
[38:17] kind of things but then you realize what
[38:21] I am Jesus you realize now he liked to
[38:24] go to the backside of the desert to take
[38:27] his intellectual is about to take his
[38:30] torch out because he knew I matter what
[38:35] started by man amen I never received it
[38:38] know wasn't taught it but by the
[38:41] revelation of Jesus Christ amen
[38:44] he knew his foundation he knew where he
[38:48] was standing because we had to be a
[38:50] benefice nation amen what he said when
[38:54] he pleased God who separated me from my
[38:56] mother's womb he confirmed that which
[38:58] friends because he knew there was a
[39:00] separating time there was a dividing
[39:02] time then you have to say no it's
[39:04] nama-hatta liveth but Christmas Liberty
[39:07] they saw the ministry the show that very
[39:10] right that he was moving on and they
[39:12] knew that there was
[39:14] amen how do we please hello then my
[39:22] brothers and sisters will find in the
[39:24] revelation of Jesus Christ the church
[39:26] age book chapter 1 now remember this
[39:29] Christ in the true church is a
[39:32] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[39:36] book of Revelation shows how that the
[39:38] Antichrist spirit would come to the
[39:40] church and define it we have these
[39:44] experience in the churches we have all
[39:47] these things coming in why because he
[39:50] tries to destroy the super treasure but
[39:53] the super church cannot be destroyed a
[39:55] man let's go further
[39:57] amen right it's a continuation of the
[40:04] book of Acts but the book of Revelation
[40:06] shows how that the Antichrist spirit
[40:08] would come into the church and defile it
[40:11] making it look one former and powerless
[40:14] it exposes Satan revealing his works
[40:19] attempted destruction of God's people
[40:22] and the discrediting of God's Word wait
[40:25] down to the time he is cast me into the
[40:29] lake of fire he fights them we don't
[40:33] have to fight the devil because we know
[40:35] where he's going amen we know that we
[40:39] are the blood of Jesus Christ
[40:40] we were we were eternal till it stops
[40:44] amen
[40:45] right and the top is a word that has to
[40:48] be manifested expression so we came into
[40:51] time and time to branch to eternity we
[40:56] like the Jewish quarter okay but now we
[40:59] are moving on it takes God undivided
[41:02] attention to blend with the Holy Ghost
[41:04] sets in our soul amen
[41:07] to work the power of Jesus Christ
[41:11] spiritually in the individual because
[41:14] maybe it's not a combination of people
[41:17] that when you go
[41:19] in the individual walk with God and how
[41:21] you'll be mentioned in the spiritual
[41:24] turn tell mommy tell God how are you
[41:27] sustaining yourself in terms of
[41:29] rectification the message that we need
[41:34] to give God our undivided attention in
[41:36] terms of these things here true that the
[41:39] supernatural could work in the natural
[41:41] the natural could work out the
[41:43] supernatural amen okay he fights them
[41:49] you cannot stand it he knows that if the
[41:52] people get the true revelation of the
[41:54] true church and what she is and what she
[41:57] stands for that she can do the greater
[41:59] works she would be invincible we are we
[42:09] are invincible amen
[42:11] because we are called of God so
[42:13] therefore this true revelation of the
[42:17] true church which we believe that we are
[42:20] in which is a mystical body amen a
[42:23] miserable the mystical body that has
[42:26] been called out individually in
[42:28] spiritual baptism under the influence of
[42:31] the Holy Ghost testifies of the fact
[42:34] that we are in the toilet and first we
[42:37] are in the body we have the word pride
[42:39] which sustained by the heavenlies so
[42:42] that God could come and take her Welli
[42:44] for each one of us to be a son then you
[42:53] say say to get the true revelation of
[42:55] the truth spirits within the framework
[42:59] of the Christian Church now watch Satan
[43:06] spirit at the church how is it greater
[43:09] at the church because some of them when
[43:12] the brand pitch the two kinds of
[43:14] believers in every Church again that
[43:17] returns a believers right
[43:19] some of them they will be just parking
[43:21] in the shade waiting to get some form of
[43:25] critics and then try to form certain
[43:29] thing
[43:30] and then caused a division amongst a
[43:32] church that's his job that is his
[43:37] purpose and that is his job but the true
[43:41] bride the true bride will fight it
[43:44] amen because she has the spirit how does
[43:48] she fight it amen
[43:52] no no my man whatever you want to do you
[43:58] do it I will love you my brother my
[44:00] sister that's it let's continue and do
[44:03] what God has purposed in our lives that
[44:05] we will be able to continue life's a
[44:08] journey for not so long because why we
[44:11] are called to get into the rapture
[44:13] please no no no it says here he will be
[44:20] as definitely tortured today as when
[44:23] Christ which studies every effort to
[44:25] gain power over him in the desert the
[44:30] great amen
[44:31] he says Satan hates revelation but we
[44:35] love it we true revelation in other
[44:38] lights the gates of Hell cannot prevail
[44:40] against us but we were prevail over a
[44:44] man man so now whenever a Paula step
[44:47] okay now we find that even as the Soul
[44:51] Eater was he already and he was singing
[44:54] and and ran with you to the vision and
[44:56] he went out there and then you know he
[45:00] he cannot be he was very and he seen the
[45:02] people and whatever and but he couldn't
[45:04] see his group and all those kind of
[45:06] things and he was getting very concerned
[45:08] and whatever but he saw Paul's group
[45:11] they you see the first group is they
[45:13] then I preach what Paul preaches and
[45:15] then his group must be there so he saw
[45:17] us us the elected bride to be there
[45:23] amen and then he came to because there's
[45:27] nothing that he has done that he has
[45:31] never told us amen everything manifested
[45:34] itself
[45:35] and then we went through and say amen
[45:38] amen
[45:39] okay now in the Lord went before them by
[45:42] day in a
[45:42] - okay so the actions will be not the
[46:16] profit but the world god amen
[46:20] having no understood this terminology
[46:23] and the expression of terminology now we
[46:26] know will be able to see now there has
[46:28] to be a manifestation shaver Paul has a
[46:33] manifestation William Branham had the
[46:36] manifestation sick was he dead was
[46:40] raised on the fish took the word great
[46:43] strong right be still
[46:46] they meant streudel yes we know day what
[46:49] did he do he never showed something that
[46:51] he didn't want to he tried to express
[46:54] the power of God that have invested in
[46:58] son to be utilized to a people of the
[47:02] world to know that Jesus Christ is the
[47:05] same yesterday today that was the same
[47:10] teacher friends we need to exercise our
[47:13] god-given responsibility our attitude
[47:19] with regard to the message of the hour
[47:22] that we will succumb to that spirit we
[47:27] have the manifestation of the world so
[47:29] the people could be see Christ amen
[47:38] praise the Lord you are a powerful God
[47:41] amen maybe we never come to the
[47:44] realization but I'm gonna read you
[47:46] something here the Ministry of the Son
[47:49] of Man was the helium of Jesus Christ
[47:53] the word trying to do God a service he
[48:00] sees you but the Elijah of this day is
[48:04] the Lord Jesus Christ he is come
[48:08] according to the son of man is to reveal
[48:15] himself amongst his people not a man God
[48:22] but he come to behold I will send you
[48:31] Elijah the Prophet before the coming of
[48:33] the day of the Lord and he shall turn
[48:35] the hearts of the father's to the
[48:36] children is our hearts amen it's a
[48:40] question and the heart of the children
[48:42] to the father's has it been done in less
[48:47] the comments might the vicar's can you
[48:52] say amen amen
[48:53] praise Allah so the Ministry of the son
[48:56] of man amen
[48:59] is of vital importance and the essence
[49:03] of spiritual and management to the blood
[49:07] of Jesus Christ because death is what's
[49:11] going to give you the sustainability of
[49:13] ratcheting faith to be understood but
[49:16] the revelation of his word
[49:19] now notice but the opening of the seven
[49:22] seals revelation channel where was it
[49:25] revelation can the full word is to be
[49:29] borne carried into manifestation again
[49:31] and if indicated by the Spirit of God in
[49:34] the food stamp and worse when it was
[49:37] here on earth so if we mentioned that
[49:41] our spiritual barometer or thermo meter
[49:45] or whatever we will see that we are in
[49:48] the same page in the same paragraph of
[49:50] the Prophet so whatever was manifested a
[49:54] has to be manifested in us amen
[49:57] Christ we must the hope of glory we are
[50:01] in types Sunday
[50:05] but Rama period and the many aspects and
[50:07] the fulfillment what is green on as we
[50:11] look at it two parallel the times the
[50:14] signs of the times in which we are
[50:16] living in certain promises of the world
[50:20] we see these things and I'm telling you
[50:23] not only from that time from this time
[50:25] the time shall be no longer let me see
[50:31] Israel we see all these kind of things
[50:33] moving on and coming on right but let's
[50:36] go as it was when it was here on earth
[50:38] manifested in the same way doing the
[50:41] same things that they did when it was
[50:43] here under amen Hebrews 13:8 said Jesus
[50:47] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[50:50] forever
[50:51] he looks simply in Turkey Jesus said in
[50:54] the last days as it was done in the days
[50:57] of Sodom when the Son of Man will be
[51:01] reveal himself again it would be the
[51:04] same would we look at ourselves and we
[51:18] take inventory and thought of the
[51:23] expression of the word in our lives we
[51:26] will see that we are not not weighed in
[51:29] the balance and found wanting
[51:31] because there are certain diversity of
[51:35] things that comes into us like that take
[51:40] us away from the reality of what God is
[51:46] now for the super church to act the way
[51:50] that God wanted to act and make mark 16
[51:53] in action there are certain categories
[51:57] that we need to further its listing
[52:02] there are things that we need to do in
[52:04] there are things that we need to put in
[52:07] place praise God hallelujah brother
[52:12] Joshua was ministering is missing and
[52:14] bringing up certain things of the Word
[52:16] of God
[52:17] it's for what to create an appetite that
[52:20] you will be able through that appetite
[52:23] we sustain and to see and look ahead and
[52:28] just be home and just to make sure that
[52:31] things are available where there are a
[52:35] maybe
[52:36] so dear friends never give up proving
[52:40] his worth
[52:41] do you believe we are living in the last
[52:42] days when the Son of Man was to be
[52:45] manifested question that would be all
[52:48] the word that's dead after Luther I was
[52:51] a Baptist and all that every Pentecostal
[52:54] all that after the revelation of what is
[52:57] on be the seventh angel was to open the

[53:52] reasoning affection and all that when we
[53:54] went away then he come to the body
[53:56] senses all that would be what went away

[59:03] they were divided hither and thither so
[59:06] that they too went over on dry God and

[59:23] I'd be taken away from me
[59:26] and in that Shakespeare I pray thee let
[59:30] a double portion of that spirit and he
[59:37] said I was asked nevertheless it does
[59:42] seem when I'm taken from thee it shall
[59:47] be so and too deep but if not it shall
[59:52] not be so he was honest and it came to

[1:09:45] to be
[1:09:57] [Music]
[1:09:59] today
[1:10:05] [Music]
[1:10:43] you have the how many time did you get
[1:11:13] into desperation come on
[1:11:16] we supposed to be candidates for the
[1:11:18] Dutch I'm speaking to everybody I'm
[1:11:21] speaking in myself okay
[1:11:23] every time the Prophet went up in the
[1:11:26] woods he prayed and God gave him a
[1:11:28] sermon he came and he preached it for a
[1:11:30] people throughout the world and we need
[1:11:36] to pray and ask God dear Heavenly Father
[1:11:41] will you come and invade yourself Emma's
[1:11:45] father as you did seem to the to brother
[1:11:49] to brother branham as you unveiled to
[1:11:52] him Lord be the same inspiration
[1:11:54] the validity of his spirit the spirit
[1:11:57] come and quicken and wickedness that be
[1:12:00] maybe we will do the very same party
[1:12:04] Israel help us slow sometimes we are
[1:12:08] finished but we are asking you for
[1:12:11] divine grace we are asking you for
[1:12:13] Greece the chakras will come and take
[1:12:17] control that you may come Lord Amen God
[1:12:39] knows our weaknesses God knows
[1:12:42] everything about us
[1:12:53] it stays in Tipton waist at 33 I'm 33
[1:12:57] and 34 of the church age book in 1st
[1:13:02] Corinthians 2:15 the true revelation is
[1:13:06] God interpreting his own worried by
[1:13:10] vindicating what is promised ever
[1:13:13] now don't let anyone be misled on what I
[1:13:17] have said and think that I do not
[1:13:20] believe in the accuracy of the world as
[1:13:23] we now have it
[1:13:26] I believe this Bible is accurate amen
[1:13:33] I believe this Bible is accurate either
[1:13:37] Jesus completely arty authenticated the
[1:13:41] Old Testament reign here on earth and it
[1:13:45] was compiled exactly as was our New
[1:13:49] Testament make no mistake about it we
[1:13:54] have the infallible Word of God today
[1:13:57] and no man days take from it or add to
[1:14:05] it
[1:14:06] because many people they suppose that
[1:14:12] this is what it is like you were Frank
[1:14:14] and injections and and what sure it will
[1:14:18] because Jackson was they and when he was
[1:14:20] climbing up and and he saw them in the
[1:14:22] corner of his eye so genius Jackson
[1:14:23] there the path trying to do something in
[1:14:25] whatsoever that's all it's not that a
[1:14:29] true revelation but the true spirit well
[1:14:34] know who she is and which them the
[1:14:39] Antichrist spirit you will know that the
[1:14:47] Holy Ghost is the interpreter of the
[1:14:50] Divine Word of God then he goes on to
[1:14:54] say but we need the same spirit that
[1:14:56] gave it to cheek to teach it to us
[1:15:02] you see you wanna find problems when the
[1:15:06] ministering spirit of pastors teachers
[1:15:09] evangelists and whatsoever
[1:15:10] come from the help desk of God sometimes
[1:15:13] you want to challenge it if you want to
[1:15:15] say it this debt and the other it goes
[1:15:17] to show what type of spirit that's in
[1:15:19] you can you say Amen praise oh he said
[1:15:24] oh how we need revelation by the Spirit
[1:15:26] we don't need a new Bible we don't do it
[1:15:30] need a new translation those some are
[1:15:32] very good and I'm not against them but
[1:15:35] we need the revelation of the Spirit
[1:15:38] come on church come on hurt and thank
[1:15:43] God we can have what we need for God

[1:15:55] Spirit to give us continuous life-giving
[1:15:59] and prevailing revelation oh if the
[1:16:03] church could only get the fresh
