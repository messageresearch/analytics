really is today [Music] amen [Music] remind us to pray for me that I don't take too long like what I did yesterday I just to go straight into straight to the point and I thought it would be a blessing to all so that people want these to our city looking at their watches and everything this starts from the book of your want to read verse one to three or let's let's just go sketch of a straight beloved when I get all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was made for for me to write unto you and exalt you that you should earnestly content for the faith which was once delivered amen amen let's go to the Hebrews chapter 13. this and [Music] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and and lastly let's read also Acts chapter 1 verse 8. but you shall receive power and dogs and they shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the outermost part of Earth you might take us his friends that the Lord add the blessing to the reading of the world Amen how many are happy tonight amen amen amen uh so I just have a little thought a little inspiration to to talk about tonight uh not very complicated I'm someone who doesn't really give much of a long titles complicated titles you know the Bible is very simple the gospel is very simple Jesus Christ was very simple or not until the Bible says common people he had him glad a man common people he had him gladly the message of the hour is not complicated you look at the life of the Prophet you could preach through nature and all that the way he was born he was never born in a big city was never born among other places in America you can think of New York or the the great places that are spoken about uh he kept there from Kentucky our Lord Jesus Christ until anything good come out of Nazareth and Nathaniel uh Phillips they come and see amen the gospel is just simple and if we become like children uh then we'll see more of God in our lives that's why the Lord say unless we we are converted like these little children we cannot enter in we cannot see the kingdom of God we cannot enter in uh the prophet also preached the message and say God hiding something Simplicity The Villages of in the same way uh that's how the gospel is we have to be simple to to see God and sometimes we we preach things that people may not understand but we are not called to understand we are caught up early all things only believe all things are possible to them that can believe and I I believe we are believers of the Bible I believe we are the Believers of the message of the hour I didn't bring anything new my title tonight is contenting for the message that's what I'm just talking about tonight I'm not bringing anything new than what you already know that which you hear every day from different ministers from the pastor here the local pastors wherever they come from is just a message of the hour and this message of the hour we can never exhaust it inexorable Fountain of power in exhaustible Fountain of Life in exhaustible Fountain you can't bring any new revelation but represent progresses but uh or what is needed for us for the Rapture lays in the church in the Box there's nothing else that we can bring there's nothing else that we can preach except this message of the hour that's what God gave us for this generation he saw it fit to give us the message of the hour that is so glorious you know my brother and nothing can be taken from it and nothing can be added to it let's just take the message as it is and the prophet say what the temps say it's not really like coming here and just read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation when you say say what the tips say he say whatever you'll be preaching let it be in line with the Bible are rightly dividing the word of Satan that's that's what really it means you say one that said to say it's not a repetition of words but preaching in light with the message of the hour preaching in the in line with the revelation of the message of the power not to deviate from it but just say exactly the message says when we talk about baptism let's baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what the message say if we dress whatever we do in weight or indeed let's all do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the message is not a Doctrine the message is not a Creed the message is the Bible reviewed the message is the opening up of the word we ought to be such a happy people in this generation because we understand the Bible now by the message of the hour we now know how to approach God by the message of our brothers you can help me to fine tune the Sunday uh then I'll tell you when it's when it's right just try to to touch the uh the bathroom there especially on the on the volume there amen thank you very much so I'm speaking on contenting uh for the message of the hour uh the Bible say uh uh you would say Be Loved when I get when I give all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me it was necessary it was of necessity I mean someone said Amen to that it was needful for me to write unto you and exalt you and encourage you and remind you that we must earnestly contained for the faith that was what delivered unto the Saints and we know in this day we have a scriptures pertaining to this day we have scripture that speaks of our day which is kind of like our our syllabus when we want to bring it to our common to our modern day understanding our syllabus like in the days of Noah the word of God was the building of the Ark according to the measurements that God was given to his prophet of the generation that time and we know that we have scriptures we have promises of God to us in this day Malachi 4 Luke 17 10 and all that and the Bible tells us in promises and that Beholder I said unto you Elijah that Prophet what was he coming to do was to turn our hearts back to the purpose in the Turning of the hearts is the Turning of the faith is not the heart relatively but telling the faith of the children back to the fathers because we believe from the heart thus telling the hearts and I believe tonight we are living in an hour when we can say this day Malachi fall is fulfilled before us hallelujah this thing is not working properly to be honest enough yeah there's a lot of abounding they just put a volume on maximum then remove the echo and the best if you remove the egg on your press then you put the volume on maximum it will it will help me well I don't want to divorce I still have a lot of days to pray how is it now how is it coming is it improving amen so turning the Huts that's telling our faith that's taking our faith back to Apostolic turning our faith back to pay the cost amen we must believe the same way they believe we must live the same way they lived we must decrease the same way they preached we must receive the same result they saw Hallelujah that's contenting for the freedom that was once delivered to the Saints now I just want to bring a brief background of what does it mean to contain to contain is to hold on and to maintain the same thing which was given to content is to stand there is to stand still upon what they've been already given and the Bible said we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and prophets in Jesus Christ himself paying the Chief Cornerstone and we must be content for that we must hold on to this message of the hour which has been delivered to us in this generation we must be World honor it doesn't make sense to us today if we if we just be ex get excited by the revelation of the message of the hour without leaving it if we are just excited by cutting the potassium without seeing the same result just many excited by just saying I need a message we're not seeing the power of the message of the hour we must see anything Contender we have to hold on we must maintain the same thing which we have received in this day in the fullness of his power in the fullness of his Revelation Hallelujah somebody help me say Amen come here somebody help me with your help somebody help me with your rejoicing somebody help me with your Hallelujah together then we move together in a sense spirit in the same realm in the same anointing Hallelujah telling the neighbors let us know something for this message let's hold on to this message of god let's stay in the message of the hour don't move away here don't go away don't leave the message brother stay in the messenger until we see the resurrected power of the Lord Jesus Christ to lead his character to look for nothing new brother let's hold on to this message of the hour there's no power to help us brother in every situation that we go through in our lives the message is the answer to the devil's question in this telling the message of the Allah is the right prescription to our day-to-day life in this day the message of the Allah to whatever situation you will be going through tonight the message of God is the answer to cancer the message of the hour is the answer to know this year the message of Allah is the answer to the spirit of adultery in this message of Allah the message of is the answer to the spirit of laughter in this generation the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a thunder the spirit of the Lord will lift up the standards against him God saw his feet in this day when he saw what was standing further he knew very well was aware very well that the message of Luda could not give us other coming power in this day he saw it that the message of John Wesley was not enough to help us in this day we have not enough power to help us in this day the enemy is coming like a flood deception is turning like a bladder then God sent the prophet could set brother to the saint of Elijah could send us a manner from Kentucky there with the message of God born under a cycle born under the peer of fire foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] in this generation we have received as a scripture prophet in this generation we have received the prophet coming from the pages of the Bible not from the Seminary College coming from the pages of the Bible not from any manner coming from the pages of the Bible if he didn't get the Prophet by the work of God a big into the Prophet by signs and wonders a Vindicated Prophet by the pig on fire a thing we got the prophet in all his ministry from his brother until the Lord took him home like until this day this message is still going on now this message is still have the same power that it had when it was placed by the same messenger can we put our hands together [Applause] [Music] we are almost today I want to preach to people this only thing that I'm not Disturbed with if I hear amen amen I'm not Disturbed but if I

righteousness contained for the power of God contained for miracles contained for signs and wonders contained for the Rapture to think we must speak about the coming of Our Lord when we talk of the culture they are not scaring anybody of Jesus Christ that's the position of this message of our that's the condition of the message of our that's the commission that we have to carry in this day we
