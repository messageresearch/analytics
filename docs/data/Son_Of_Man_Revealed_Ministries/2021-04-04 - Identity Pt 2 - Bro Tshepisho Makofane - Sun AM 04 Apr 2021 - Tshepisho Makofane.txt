resurrection especially as we commemorate the greatest resolutions [Music] all of us to be here this morning [Music] with the scripture that we read on friday in ephesians chapter three from verse 14 to 19 and also read coverage 21-29 of whom lord whole family in heaven and earth is named that he will grant you according to the wishes of his glory to be struggled with might by his spirit in the inner mind that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all things and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which has knowledge that you might be healed with all the trueness of god amen for one yet now have he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unbelievable and unbelievable in his sight [Applause] who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind on the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his body's state which is the church the church is his word amen where i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which had been hidden [Music] to generations but now he's being made manifest to his sins to whom god will make known what is the richest of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is us we we have a blessed one because paul says he's the apostle to the gentiles the messenger to the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of lord this mystery that had been healed throughout the ages yes has now been made known as the gentiles christ in you the hope of god that's maybe the two most creatures [Music] 16. know me not that you are a temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you i trust that we know this man that you foreign the center of god and the spirit of god if any man defy the temple of god he shall god be stopped for the temple of god in its temple you are amen second [Music] amen for what fellowship difficulties and one convenient third life in darkness now also just do you have an especially this unequal look the the bible is discouraging because you have nothing in common and paul is encouraging us to be not to be an equally old with our beliefs or what part had he had believed with an infidel and what argument have the terminal of god with idols for you are the temple of the living god as god said i he says you are god's instrumentality if god wants to do anything he can only be back and that's what the bible says here that god said that i will be in them and i will walk him and i will be their god and they shall be mighty wherefore come out from among them and be your separate saith the lord and touch nothing in faith and i will deceive you and will be a father unto you and he shall be my sons and daughters say the lord almighty let us pray blessed almighty god amen once again this morning together this morning [Music] [Music] he's listening [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Applause] this is families the name of the lord amen [Music] thank you for the hospitality the foundation of the world and one is someone in there in this depth somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are the dust of the earth and in heaven there was a book of memory and [Music] he knew [Music] is how much more glorious was that sunrise amen to us right in the beginning much more glorious than that very festive amen because the real scene had been broken the one who yes [Music] in all the history of the world [Music] of the old testament prophets of all the the mighty works that god manifested in their lives satan always sat in a corner and knew that when they come to the end of life's journey they are coming uh [Music] [Music] the bible shows [Music] and the lord jesus christ can come to declare [Music] is [Music] [Applause] yes where that 89. [Music] you can pick up [Music] [Music] is [Music] the first one to reach maturity and what does it mean and it means that the rest of the field must come to the same level of maturity in our age god brings up a prophet who reached the level it gives us hope to know that we are to reach the same level of the church amen no god did not this message is from god this message has been dedicated [Music] [Applause] you [Music] hey church and he must have that type of vision for him to receive he's not going to receive the christians that are still greed once the witch has reminded him and then i'm we look back to our origin to see ourselves in the mind of god and to see ourselves as an attribute question and answers where the prophet of god says and i look back and hope to capture it but i think i'll just take it if you start a cod you can go all the way back and to sort of page 14 there but i wanted to pick it up somewhere i think it's in page and 21 52 cog it says now and privacy to understand um that's pretty good that's [Music] [Music] and we are returning back to that image that's right to our first created image amen i like what the program is teaching us here because you know again we can read genesis 126. i was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit i wasn't conscious of anything as far as but i was dead all of us we [Music] because he's saying something real important i wasn't conscious of anything as far as i know of but i was dead oh but now just a minute jesus told the disciple that he knew that before the foundation and paul said here that he chose us in here before the conditional world now there was some part of me me here is to my analysis these spirits which rotated off of god they were a part of god and all that god wanted to do was to express it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] which the prophet says for a jewish person to end up in that position he has really would have been [Music] and that same way that became flesh in a body called jesus is that same well as we can flesh us today it has to be fresh in us today and we saw when also who for many years lost his crop to the philippines but one day when he realized that he's a jew and when he got to again who came to himself he is a jew and he would slave [Music] rotated [Music] [Applause] into existence by the word of god no to see that you know you're not just a a believer but god spoke you into it amen and for you to be here today [Music] this bible is our id books amen when we pick up this bible to to find ourselves in this book to see ourselves and here the bible says i will dwell in them and walk in them and you put yourself in the way and imagine yourself in the scripture what it says i will blame them you say god is saying he will develop in me he will walk in me he's saying that i am his temple a book and see ourselves in here it gives us authority it gives us power we are able to live victorious and because amen he he allocated us to different times and seasons and he declared here in this age to come and receive this message to come and manifest his history [Applause] the right to the finish and that's why the bible says in hebrews 11 [Music] and we'll just take it for context in in the midst of god god expressed in jesus christ who was old father son and holy all manifested or in the lord jesus christ and that's why also gracious tonight and he was the fullness of god in the body amen and he says the fullness of the godhead body now the complete fullness of the body and body dwells in this church he just said to us god expressed in jesus christ [Music] [Music] the poured into christ and all christ lost he poured into the church and you know we need to highlight and emphasize the bible and then probably say here oh amen [Applause] because you can say that because [Music] [Music] amen because a son of god cannot be cannot be god god is only together you receive me amen because then i received me received the network that all that was god he has been poured into me and he said that all that is in me i recorded him [Music] and receive the father because all that was in god was poured into me and all of us in the lord jesus christ as we poured into the church the beginnings and maybe we appreciate and recognize that that all means all right and and and also that as as as god is and maybe this this story that the prophet calls chaos himself it's not so much it's not like you're putting water into it and then you pour water into a glass but that's not that's not that kind of product it's a complete so the only place that the jews could find god in their age amen if they sought god they had to come to the lord jesus christ and and so any anyone else that they thought they are worshiping as god when jesus says all power in heaven he is saying that that one is no power [Music] he is now poured into the church he says in the spoken word have faith in god part of sin and his inspiration and it books the whole bible together on every word in the bible it's the most wonderful book that has come out and you know it's a it's a it's our story [Music] and where you are [Music] and jesus christ the son of god he was the word of god here on earth we know that he was god's way in the beginning amen god entitled to working himself since he was either god himself manifested in flesh or the greatest deceiver the lord has ever had he was god amen he's given us [Music] [Applause] to say that the lord jesus christ he was both human and god amen and he said coming out the mountain he was hunting like a man when he saw the tree he looked to find things and [Music] whatever he said it had to come to pass because it was god speaking out of the name that created power of god same creative power and everything that god wants he emptied his entire being amen there was no part left anywhere else that they didn't even know what because there is a dimension yes he's walking heaven into jesus christ and everything jesus christ was every day underlying everything that jesus christ was [Music] that we should not come to a spot where we don't realize who we are you don't realize the power that's life in this building is [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Applause] uh [Applause] but now how would we look for him what kind of person would we look for if we wanted to see if you are the same if he was here in arkansas tonight in this room he says [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] that's [Music] [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's exactly what [Music] is [Music] we are the word [Applause] [Music] and that's why he says was here today he would be the word of god that's exactly what he wants and he still is he is the way not only the ritual yes but the manifestation [Music] and he was manifested in flesh that was jesus christ god in mind amen so that's our mystery today because the question that was answering says but now he [Music] bible says exodus 4 15 and thou shalt speak unto me and put words in his mouth and i will be with thy mom with his mouth and will teach you what you shall do and you and he shall be life's old man unto the people and he shall be even he shall be to be instead of the mouth and thou shall be to you instead of god this is this is god moses amen and you know god says to moses because moses and i can't go away when [Music] [Music] [Applause] is [Applause] uh god made moses so much of god that he never no he wasn't just god god was god he made moses god and even made him a prophet and aaron the bible says aaron was not the prophet because moses which is what he says in chapter 4 he will be unto you okay because the prophet amen is that's what moses and that's again the key that they have to the length we have to look at ourselves too that's that's where we have to find and locate our identity that god has made us god the same way that he did moses moses coming from the presence of god with the word of god for that age now watch uh 19 or 20 that's where it goes says for that age he says there is a word for each age yes and moses coming further his face shine so shiny saucy the word was in amen ready to be manifested to be given out today so this moles is now coming with the way the word in him ready to be given out today moses noticed him to us with moses and was ready to be myself [Applause] moses had to date himself that um [Music] [Applause] he was god and that's what the prophet is teaching us here and in the prophet and the word is in the mind so now if the word if moses made moses god whatever [Music] is jews [Applause] [Music] rejected now at the end of this dispensation much like so the word was rejected as the son of man in the midst of the lord jesus christ the truth because what is the message the message is to identify christ this is the same ingestion of christ yeah and now the revelation of the word will reveal to them and he says there's seven seals to the gentiles christ and and that's why when they receive the revelation [Music] [Music] for which [Music] foreign but for blessing when you want to call yourself god has to bless you when you want to receive that god had made himself man it wasn't a man making himself god god had come to make himself man that's what happened there he said he said jesus is not written in your lord i said you are god the word of god came and the scripture cannot be wrong so what name moses god was because he had the word [Applause] and that's what makes the right god she becomes that final voice in this age and the proper god says and in souls are increasing up three four five he says uh look at the scriptures hiding here could it be in the church is going yeah [Music] [Music] of his way the power of this revelation and it will break forth into the other dimension but he is yet to remain as the word of god sixth sin has produced itself amen and the prophet is the two prophets yes and it says the seventh take our office again [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] down and go and call him lord see what would you have to do the life that was in him will be produced in us that's saying like i was in the lord jesus christ the same one who strike what will be the people [Music] [Music] that our lives have to be a reproduction of the life of the lord jesus christ and because you know it was not so much when we talk about the blood it's not so much the character but the light of the that lord life and that's why the prophet teaches us that the life of bulls and gold couldn't help because the life of the animal could not come into the community but when he came as our kinsmen redeemer the children were partakers of flesh and blood amen he had to come and partake of flesh and blood here to come and become [Music] [Applause] [Music] of us and okay something is the same the same point that he's making around that any imposter can come here he says in the spoken recording jesus he makes this point and that man could be trying to make himself jesus he says and jesus will not be seen in that kind of a body until we see him god identified himself in you you are his temple yes you are [Music] what should not confuse us is that [Applause] [Music] [Music] is to feed our souls to this way and the more we eat this way the more the the inner man has power over this place the more the stress comes under subjection of the way [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] as um he says look god in his body christ and christ in his body thereby god made money in christ christ made brightness in the from the body of christ his flesh his body which is the way and is [Music] that god was in his body cut and that christ is not in his body thereby god manifested himself in that body called jesus christ and now christ has manifested himself in his body thereby the [Applause] [Music] [Music] now you fellows that's what he said god in this body it says now again you must believe now now christ the words that i do shall leave you also see the same god the words [Music] as god did his promises in christ's body soul is kind through his same words in christ's body vision amen same way that god fulfilled his promises in his body how the lord jesus christ saw in the lord jesus christ fulfilling his words his promises in his body the bride of christ that's that's who she is in this age her identity is him amen she is [Music] [Music] god manifested in human flesh amen deceived do we see that the spirit of god is now being manifest in human flesh and do the same thing that god did in human [Music] the promised land came that was the last sign that saw that sodom and iger's group before the promised land arrived did you notice that now the chess spirit has come to that power the last sign that god manifested in abraham's time before the promised life of the life was god in human flesh amen has come to exactly the same hour where god is manifesting the last sight and that messiah is him manifested in flesh again amen [Applause] manifestations that we must be the manifestation of god in human beings [Music] [Music] see doing the same thing same way same thing that he did all the time he never changed the internal life and upon and today he has manifested himself in human bodies that the one that he has called and done exactly the same thing he had done by times in the times of his flesh upon death and doing the same thing today so what he did in the lord jesus christ he's doing the same thing today see the sun being revealed in the last days god manifested in human flesh sitting just before soros destruction [Music] [Music] and ending light and vinegar dedicated by god himself through his promised word for the language we promised this in the last days since now if you are spiritual when we see all these the great three-fold revelation god in christ christ in the church and the kingdom comes it has to follow that that it was god who was in christ cries out in the church and and then the kingdom the full manifestation of the kingdom of heaven only for those people who who christ was it the people who had christ dedicated way by his original hatred i'm talking about the headsheet of christ what is being personally identified by the original hatching we have the answer to the devil's question amen without this revelation you don't have an answer to the demonstration anything else in your dispossession but when you catch this revelation amen [Music] that god in this redeemed flesh could myself his word for the day as indeed in that day amen god in this church who manifests his way for the [Music] through the sanctifying grace of god has got many signs of god which is anointed with this the same law that i have mentioned here is not [Music] but now that you'll find in the whole universal church of the living god that same god the same way that that's why it's the same is how he yeah to manifest himself in us today and he said he also said that same logos have the mind and he has a right and as the children of god you supremely it must take supreme control the the world how
