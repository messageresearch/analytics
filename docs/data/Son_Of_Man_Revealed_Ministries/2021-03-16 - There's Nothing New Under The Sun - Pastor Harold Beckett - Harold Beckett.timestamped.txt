[27:58] believe that they
[27:59] will protect our brother joshua if you
[28:01] have your bibles with you today we
[28:03] read in the word of god uh in the book
[28:06] of ethics chapter
[28:07] chapter one and we read verses nine
[28:11] uh the book of equal estates chapter one
[28:13] and verses nine from the old testament
[28:16] the bible reached us the thing that has
[28:19] been
[28:20] it is that it shall be and that which is
[28:23] done
[28:24] is that which shall be done and there is
[28:27] no new thing
[28:27] under the sun amen then also we read in
[28:30] the
[28:31] book of second corinthians chapter
[28:33] chapter 4
[28:34] and we read from verse 16 and we trust
[28:38] the lord will bless the living of
[28:39] his word to our hearts ii
[28:42] chapter 4 and verse 16 to 18.
[28:47] the bible reads that spell for which
[28:49] cause we faint not
[28:50] but though our upward man perish yet the
[28:53] inward man is renewed day by day
[28:56] for our light affliction which is but
[28:58] for a moment
[28:59] working for us a far more exceeding and
[29:02] eternal weight of glory
[29:04] while we look not at the things that are
[29:07] seen
[29:08] but the things which are not seen for
[29:10] the things which are not seen
[29:12] are temporal but things are seen are
[29:14] temporal but the things which are not
[29:16] seen
[29:16] are eternal may god bless the reading of
[29:20] this word that says have a word of
[29:21] prayer
[29:22] uh kind father we are certainly grateful
[29:24] thankful for the opportunity the
[29:26] privilege to be
[29:26] at the tabernacle and we thank you for
[29:29] the songs that we've heard here today
[29:31] about sunset mountain
[29:33] god redemption by power seven angels
[29:35] that came
[29:36] we are certainly happy lord to living
[29:38] this wonderful day one at a time
[29:40] and to see this great message of the
[29:42] hour unfold to us
[29:43] we understand that no man they give us a
[29:45] revelation
[29:46] not even william bannon could give us
[29:48] revelation all revelation comes from god
[29:51] and father we want to say thank you we
[29:53] pray god at your comfort
[29:55] those who god was lost their loved ones
[29:57] we pray god that you will heal the wound
[29:59] and that's where the venom said lord our
[30:01] death is like tooth extraction
[30:03] it hurts for a while but after a while
[30:05] the god heals up again
[30:07] and so lord we pray that you bless this
[30:09] assembly we pray god for the future of
[30:11] this church we pray god for the
[30:13] leadership and we pray that you will
[30:14] bless them
[30:15] and may the hand of god be upon each and
[30:18] every one we pray for every assembly in
[30:19] durban
[30:20] and every local minister in your local
[30:22] church those who are struggling and
[30:24] those who are finding your feet
[30:26] we pray that you will help them father
[30:27] we are not divided but we are one body
[30:30] and we look not to the things that we
[30:32] see and we look to the things that are
[30:34] unseen
[30:35] and these unseen things are more real
[30:37] than what we can see
[30:39] may you bless your people bless the word
[30:40] of god to our hearts in jesus name amen
[30:44] and you may take your seats we want to
[30:46] greet you in the name of the lord and we
[30:47] are
[30:48] certainly happy to be in the house of
[30:50] the lord here today
[30:51] and we want to be looking at our
[30:53] thoughts here this morning on there's
[30:54] nothing new under the sun
[30:56] and for uh inspiration the unseen is
[30:59] more real than what we can see
[31:01] so two scriptures that we want to focus
[31:03] on is the
[31:04] there's nothing new under the sun and uh
[31:07] and
[31:07] so we see that the unseen things are
[31:09] more real
[31:10] that what we can see we see our natural
[31:13] things that we are coming to the earth
[31:16] with no choice he did not ask to be in
[31:18] south africa
[31:19] uh you didn't ask to be in a certain
[31:21] family to be united to be ready to be a
[31:24] chatty or
[31:25] uh to be a gang in everything that god
[31:27] has planned for us before the world ever
[31:29] began
[31:30] and so we have no choice of country we
[31:32] have no choice of family
[31:34] uh we have no choice of country but god
[31:36] placed us on the earth
[31:38] at a certain time in a certain family
[31:40] under a certain message
[31:42] and god is in control of all things and
[31:44] so god is so more supreme that what we
[31:47] can think
[31:48] that our normal mind can never
[31:49] comprehend the greatness of
[31:51] almighty god and so we see that
[31:53] everything around us our achievements
[31:55] and our
[31:56] natural birth has begins natural birth
[32:00] has a beginning
[32:01] we have a manufacture date we have an
[32:03] expiry date we have an
[32:05] entry date we have an exit date
[32:07] everything
[32:08] in this life is natural and there's no
[32:11] continuing setting nothing that
[32:13] continues on and what we see today is
[32:16] already has been
[32:17] and so we see that genesis is the book
[32:19] of seeds
[32:20] and revelation is a book of harvest so
[32:23] we're living in harvest time
[32:24] what was sown in seed form has now come
[32:27] back into harvest
[32:28] form and so we can see a pattern that
[32:30] god has
[32:31] that everything that we we see today has
[32:34] been played out in some form
[32:36] in some nation in some family or some
[32:39] individual
[32:40] but there's nothing new under the sun
[32:42] and we look at raya we see that ray was
[32:44] the type of the entire bride
[32:46] how that she was a bad infant woman but
[32:48] she was called to marry solomon the
[32:50] general of bethlehem
[32:52] and she became the great grandmother of
[32:53] king david
[32:55] we looked at ruth coming from a
[32:56] moabitess nation and incest this nation
[32:59] and yet she became the bride of boaz
[33:02] and so we can see a pattern you can see
[33:04] we're back here in the evening time
[33:06] uh we can see the lamborghini in the
[33:07] evening time we can see a harvest
