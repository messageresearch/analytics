But don't lose faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For you're never alone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For the God of the mountain, he's the God in the valley.

When things go wrong, [Music] he'll make them right. for the God of &gt;&gt; He's the God. He's the God in the time, the God of the day. He's the God in the night. From verse three says, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, in order to access heavenly bless uh heavenly these blessings, we got to be in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Christ, &gt;&gt; according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Father, Lord, we love you this morning. We thank you, Lord, that we can be found in your most holy presence, oh God. Father, we can lay aside this time, oh God, to come and Lord, the day after the Sabbath, oh God, to come, Lord, the waving of that wave sheep, oh God. We thank you, Lord, that this is the holy convocation, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we come to honor your resurrection, Lord Jesus. And I pray, Lord, for your blessings upon us this morning as we come around the revealed word of the hour. We have nothing else to feed on besides your revealed word. Oh God, we haven't come here, Lord, for social gathering. We haven't come here, Lord, to meet one another. But we have come to meet with the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. God, I pray will focus our hearts and our minds and our attention now. And Lord, I pray Revelation will be in attendance. Your great Holy Spirit will open up the eyes of our understanding and break the bread of life to our hungry souls. We ask your blessings now and we ask your blessings over the hearer of the word, the speaker of the word. And I pray your Holy Ghost will anoint both of us now in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with much thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn to your neighbor and ask me if they're ready for the word. &gt;&gt; Now I haven't come this morning to preach a wishy-washy sermon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We come because of the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says that teaching places you positionally to know who you are. And he says, "Unless we know who we are, we can never truly have faith, &gt;&gt; perfect faith." &gt;&gt; If you want mustard seed faith, plenty of churches preaching mustard seed faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; But we are looking for perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I spoke to you the last time I told you, take a mustard seed in your hand. See if you can hold that faith for too long. &gt;&gt; See how long you can hold on to a mustard seed. Because Jesus is saying if you had the faith, the grain of a mustard seed. So see how long you can hold the grain of a mustard seed in your hand without you losing it and then see how long you'll be able to sustain that kind of faith. &gt;&gt; So we come now in the message of the hour. We come with the opening of the word that seventh seal open to us. &gt;&gt; So then we must be able to stomach the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I say this again, we we don't have too much of time for the rapture, &gt;&gt; the changing of our bodies. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; So now is the time we must feed on the word, &gt;&gt; equip ourselves with the word so we can get ready for that body change &gt;&gt; because that's what the word has come to do. So if we're looking at our scripture, Amen, just to confirm, you got the notes. Praise the Lord. Amen. You know this year when we enter the new year the Lord gave us inspiration the opening up of dimensional doors. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord &gt;&gt; and we come to see the further unfolding of that revelation through the months of preaching the Holy Spirit making it more clear. You know we had been looking at Matthew 25. I'm sure all of you were in these services. Matthew 25 and we found if you put up 25:10 there, you'll see a door was open to marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember the wise and foolish virgins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll see there a door was open to them and they were pulled into the marriage. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So there's two classes of people on the earth right now. The wise and the foolish. &gt;&gt; But the wise are not just virgins anymore. The wise are the married wife of the Lord Jesus Christ reproducing his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the the ones that went in are married to Christ and they are taking the seed word eaten the book reproducing the life of Jesus Christ matching the ministry to welcome back the headstone Christ and thereby fulfilling the scripture that we just read. We are predestinated to adoption. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So this can only happen in the bride age. It can't happen in the Leosian age. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been through this now that it's the bride age. It's not the Leosian church age. So, we're going to look at three things here. The prophet is speaking about about the mystery of his will, the mystery of his coming, and the mystery of sitting together in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; And see how the the Holy Spirit was speaking to the prophet and tying these things together. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So if we get to our first quote there just to lay this at the foundational quote, brother Brandham now is going to be talking about Ephesians chapter 1:3. I'm going to read it again. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we mustn't read too quickly over that because the prophet is now going to break it down for us, &gt;&gt; right? How do we get into heavenly places? How do we get in Christ? And then there's a two-part getting into Christ. Right? So that's what we're going to be looking at this morning. Now remember this adoption that we are looking at is not like you can't have children and we adopting a child. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In this adoption, the husband and wife come together, they have a child, &gt;&gt; but the child goes through tutors and governors. &gt;&gt; Amen. through a training period. And when the child comes to maturity, the father then adopts the son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that adoption means the all authority that the father had is now given to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Because we can't talk about the power of the spoken word and and operating these things if authority is not given to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's read. He made known unto us the mystery. He says get the Holy Spirit on you sometime and start running that then just watch how it goes this afternoon about 30 minutes to study just look at the lesson or maybe not I'll say about half of that 15 minutes between the times so the prophet is saying the Holy Spirit can take 15 minutes to reveal something to you &gt;&gt; all he needed was 15 minutes and I got to running and I thought the mystery how mysterious and the scripture pulled me back into the Old Testament and then back over into the New Testament and tied something together. &gt;&gt; Now, when you tie something together, they become &gt;&gt; one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everyone paying attention, everyone getting the thought. &gt;&gt; He's tying the whole Who's tying this, brother Brandham? No. Who is he saying tying it? &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He's tying these three things together. The mystery of his coming. &gt;&gt; The mystery of his will. &gt;&gt; The mystery of us sitting together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you know we've been dealing with that of us sitting together in heavenly places in that great headstone. &gt;&gt; How we are the church that is coming now to meet the headstone. Now if you don't get this mystery, you're going to miss a big chunk of the message. So pay attention. So the prophet is saying the Holy Spirit is tying the mystery of his coming. the mystery of his will and the mystery of us sitting together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, if we touch on the first one, the mystery of his coming. If we are sitting with a denominational concept this morning about the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That one day the sky is going to split open. &gt;&gt; Are we going to see the Lord in the air? &gt;&gt; Then you miss your message. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because the coming of the Lord started with a shout. &gt;&gt; That's correct. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, if you don't believe the seventh seal is open, you are going to say, "I don't believe that." Right? But the seventh seal is open. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We've been through that through months. And you know, the prophet says that the the mighty angel himself, Christ himself, open that seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, the mystery of his coming We know that he's telling us that these three are tied together. They go hand in hand, tied together. So they are one. Now the mystery of his coming, I would say, has been revealed to us. The apostle Paul, if you put up 1 Corinthians chapter 4 there, verse 16, somewhere around there, you'll see he is just telling us about a shout, a voice, and a trump &gt;&gt; talking about the coming of first, sorry, first Thessalonians, talking about the coming of the Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; He doesn't detail the shout. &gt;&gt; He doesn't detail the voice. &gt;&gt; He doesn't detail the trump of God. All he says, the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout &gt;&gt; with the voice of the archangel. And with the trump of God, the dead in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It takes a prophet now in the rapture message just before he leaves to talk about the shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we are looking at what the prophet is saying about the shout, I I'm I'm laying this again. We've been through it before, but I want you to get it. Now let's let's first deal with the fact that Revelation 10 is the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if we believe this is a fulfillment of Revelation 10, &gt;&gt; which means the seventh seal was open to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not seeing anybody everybody saying amen this morning. &gt;&gt; But let's get through it. Maybe by the end of the service you're going to be agreeing with me. &gt;&gt; Right. So let's see how the prophet is talking about and I'm going to ask you to change. If you are listening to internet preachers, you are going to be confused. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I am not here to sort out your questions about you listening to internet preachers and what they are saying. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're part of this assembly and you're part of this ministry, you've got to listen to what the pastor is saying because the pastor is an angel to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So why I'm saying this? People are preaching what? Not what brother Brandham said, but what they think he meant. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. You don't believe me? Let's go and sort out one teaching that's going around. Let's go to Revelation chapter 3. or maybe sorry revelation chapter 6 &gt;&gt; sorry brother Josh I got to do this &gt;&gt; amen because spirit wants to make things clear &gt;&gt; but I want to background quickly and then we can move on right &gt;&gt; he says and I saw when the lamb opened one of those one of the seals and I heard as it was a noise of thunder now people are taking that and saying see he doesn't say he opened the first seal he opened one of the seals &gt;&gt; right you heard that preaching &gt;&gt; so which means let's read and when he had opened one of the seals I heard noise of the thunder, one of the beast saying, "Come and see." And I saw behold a white horse. So according to their teaching, the seventh seal is revealing a white horse. Is everybody reading this? &gt;&gt; So how can the seventh seal be open first? &gt;&gt; When he is saying the first seal is the white horse rider, then let's go to Revelation chapter. If that is the first seal or if that is the seventh seal, then what about Revelation 81? &gt;&gt; Revelation 81. you put there when he had opened the seventh seal. So which means the seventh seal going to open twice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So Revelation 6:1, he is opening the first seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is opening the first seal. Who is opening it is what people are getting. The one opening it is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. He is that seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So now having sorted that prophet is going to talk about the seventh seal. Now &gt;&gt; he says the seven and last one of these seals. So what's the last one of these seals? Somebody say seven seals. &gt;&gt; When they open it's found in Revelation the 10th chapter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where is the seventh seal found? &gt;&gt; In the 10th chapter of Revelation. Praise the Lord. What is that seventh seal? It's the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal is the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't brother Brandham says the seventh seal brings him back to the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And how does it start? Starts with a shout. &gt;&gt; It starts with a shout. What is the shout? &gt;&gt; It's a message. So he says the seven and last one of these seals when they are open is found in Revelation the 10th chapter there was a mighty angel which was Christ came down put one foot on the land and on the sea raised up his hand the day is finished time is run out it's all over time shall be no more &gt;&gt; praise the Lord I want to get to 206 said just to confirm what the prophet is saying the last one of them is revelation 10 &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; so the seventh seal is revelation Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mighty angel coming down &gt;&gt; with a shout. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now watch what brother Brandham says here next. Right? He says, "But when these seven thunders," now remember the thunders are found in Revelation 10. But when these sign is over in Revelation 10, he said, "Don't write them at all. &gt;&gt; They are mysteries. We don't know what they are yet, but in my opinion, they'll be revealed right away." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, they are revealed right away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when it do, it'll give us faith for that rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For the church to move out &gt;&gt; out where? Out here. If you don't come into heavenly places and join with the headstone, you got to join in here first &gt;&gt; before you can take a rapture. &gt;&gt; He called you out of Leosia to come here and unite with him, then take you in the rapture. Praise the Lord. You see, we've just moved out through everything we know through all dispensation. We've watched everything. We've seen mysteries of God. We've seen the appearing of the great gathering together of the bride in the last days. &gt;&gt; Gathering together. What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; The gathering together of the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's see what he's talking about. He says like it seal broken in the word of God reveals to the man of the age. What age we living in? &gt;&gt; The spirit of the age, the church of the age. Revelation 10 at the end we find when the last seal was broke. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We find the angel standing with one foot on the land, other on the sea with his hands up to heaven, rainbow over his head, swearing by him that lives forever that time has run out when that last seal and you wait till we get into them seals and see where that seal is at. So, have these quotes established that Revelation 10 is the seventh seal? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, me saying it is the prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. So this is coming together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the headstone. &gt;&gt; Christ coming back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; With a message. Now let's just move the thought quickly. So we are saying the shout. Let's detail the shout. The first thing comes when he starts descending from heaven. There's a shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. What is it? Is a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To get the people together. So, you see what's getting us together into heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Pay attention now because if you're agreeing with me on this port, you got to agree with me on the next port. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Brother Adrian's reading ports of the prophet." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I see. I'm a good fisherman. So, I'm fishing now and reeling you in the show. You know about fishing. Some of you brothers know about fishing. So, I'm throwing a bait out to you. What is he saying the message is? What is the shout? A message to gather people together, &gt;&gt; right? A message comes forth first. Shout a messenger getting the people ready, getting the bride together. The first thing comes forth is his message. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; So, we all established that it's the message, the shout that gets the bride together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read the next one. And then there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all. That's right. And I believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So one is saying the shout the message is going to get us ready. &gt;&gt; This part is saying the seven thunders are going to gather us. &gt;&gt; So is it the same thing? &gt;&gt; Very good. Everybody is agreeing that the short message and the seven thunders is the same message. &gt;&gt; Now you remember he says the messenger of Malachi 4, Revelation 10:7 will do two things. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why am I saying this? Some people don't believe that the seven thunders are to their voices. &gt;&gt; But here what the prophet is saying, the seven thunders will gather the bride. &gt;&gt; We just read quotes in the rapture message where he's saying the sharp message is gathering the bride. &gt;&gt; So you know and now remember I can't give you revelation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I can preach to you something. &gt;&gt; I can preach you my revelation. What the prophet is saying. &gt;&gt; This is not my revelation. I'm preaching to you, but you've got to ask the Holy Spirit to give you revelation to quicken that word. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you'll just be repeating what I am repeating. &gt;&gt; But you're going to be able to say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; how come I missed this?" Now, &gt;&gt; he's saying the shout message is to get the people together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here he's saying the seven thunders will get the people together. &gt;&gt; Remember, he says the seven thunders are contained in the seals. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what is going to get us up here into heavenly places? &gt;&gt; We can say it's the sharp message or the seven thunder message. &gt;&gt; Is going to get us up here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why I said this morning, we haven't come here to preach a wishywashy sermon. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We come here to give you rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; So, how do we get into heavenly places? Because remember, we are looking at three things. The mystery of his coming. &gt;&gt; Yes. the mystery of his will &gt;&gt; and the mystery of us sitting together in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Spirit tied these three things together to say they are one thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So if we are saying that we've all established now what is the mystery of his coming? Denominations don't know this. &gt;&gt; The mystery of his coming is that he has descended with a shout. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And when he has descended with a shout, seven thunders are to their voices. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just want to see if we're all on the same page here. So he says remember it cannot be taught in any seminary. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's a mystery. You cannot know it by education. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By theology. &gt;&gt; It's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You mean this great mystery &gt;&gt; has been waiting for us? &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. &gt;&gt; The mystery of his coming, the mystery of his will, the mystery of us sitting together in heavenly places is depending on the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the mystery of his coming to summarize is the seventh seal, the Revelation 10 1 Thessalonians 4:16. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now if we are looking at the mystery of his will, anyone's got any questions on the mystery of his coming? We know he's come with a shout, &gt;&gt; a message. And that's why people are not enthused about the message because they don't have a revelation of what this message is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They think the message is a bunch of laws. &gt;&gt; You know, dress right, do right, act right. &gt;&gt; Speak Lord. &gt;&gt; But this message has come to call back sons to adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if he calls you and he quickens you, that's right. That seed gene within you makes you start to dress right, to live right, to act right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; We don't have to force you to do these things. &gt;&gt; What the message is doing is to quicken that C gene within you. And Amen. Once that CG gene is within you, it recognizes who you are, your pedigree, and what you called for. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, the mystery of his will, let's look at that. &gt;&gt; If you got any questions on the mystery of his coming, you can speak to me. Let's read what the mystery of his will is then. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You want to know what the mystery of his will is? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the mystery of his will, let's see what the prophet is saying. Now let's read. All right. In the ninth verse. Praise the Lord. If you're looking at first, if you're looking at Ephesians, the prophet is going to read the ninth verse. That's what he's referencing. Amen. If you want to put it up, we'll read it first. Hallelujah. And to make not make all men see what the fellowship of the mystery. Sorry. Ephesians 1:9, not 3:9. Having made unto known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he had purposed in himself. Now before we read the quote the the apostle Paul is saying he has made known to us the mystery of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let me ask you you're all saying amen. What is the mystery of his will? Sorry we all saying we know the apostle Paul is saying having made known unto us the mystery of his will. We just been through the mystery of his coming. &gt;&gt; But he's saying, "Having made known unto us the mystery of his will." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor what the mystery of the will is. &gt;&gt; Let's see now what the prophet is saying. Praise the Lord. Having made known to us the mystery of his will to adopt us. &gt;&gt; So the mystery of his will is adoption. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's got to start with the coming. &gt;&gt; Everybody seeing that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This the mystery of his coming has got to be revealed first before the mystery of his will. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because he has to come first to call his own sons back to him. &gt;&gt; So the mystery of his will to adopt us &gt;&gt; according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He purposed it himself before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, who is tying this together? I'm going to say again, the Holy Spirit is tying this together. He's tying the coming of the Lord, the mystery of his coming, and he's tying the mystery of his will to adopt us together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the Holy Spirit is tying the seventh seal and the adoption mystery together. &gt;&gt; And he's also tying the mystery of us sitting together in heavenly places together. So if these two if we are just saying now that the mystery of his coming is revealed. You all agree mystery of his coming is revealed. &gt;&gt; We all agree that the mystery of his will which is adoption is revealed to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then what about the mystery of sitting together in heavenly places? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adoption is also called the placing of sons. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So, let's read what the prophet is saying here. Now, Wednesday is night, we got into the fifth verse, right? Prophet is referencing the Ephesians 1:5. Now, right, that we were called to adoption. He's saying unto the adoption or the placing of people. &gt;&gt; How did God trying to place his people? So, he's come for us with a shout, with a message, with the seven thunders to place us in our position. Yes. &gt;&gt; Remember, it's your seven thunders that gives us faith for rapture. &gt;&gt; And he says we can't have faithful rapture unless we know our position. &gt;&gt; Can you see how it's being tied together? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, now we're going to stop just a second on the adoption. The fifth verse, trying to get down as far as we possibly can. Now remember the theme. It's all together on placing. So what is adoption? Placing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many understands that? &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's hear you say with one word. So the prophet is going to ask the congregation to repeat and I'm going to ask you to repeat. Placing the body of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; the body of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; positionally &gt;&gt; positionally &gt;&gt; in Christ &gt;&gt; in Christ &gt;&gt; where the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; where the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; is leading us &gt;&gt; is leading us. &gt;&gt; Now brothers and sisters, this is the prophet's definition of adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The aspect of us getting the robe and the authority is one aspect of adoption. &gt;&gt; But the prophetic gift is telling us the definition of adoption is placing the body of Jesus Christ positionally in Christ. Now, have you ever thought about that? Re reread that. &gt;&gt; You're going to place the body of Jesus Christ in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I say don't read too fast. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How are we going to place the body of Jesus Christ in Christ? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says the definition of adoption and he's asking the church to repeat it. He's placing the body of Jesus Christ positionally in Christ where the Holy Spirit is leading us. &gt;&gt; There you are. Now you got it. Positionally placing us and the book of EP Ephesus is to do that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Notice now placing the body not an individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the body is made up of many members. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's get to the first part. Placing the body of Jesus Christ. Now we all want to be part of the body of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; right? So we'll go to scripture. Then how do we get into the body? So before the body is placed in Christ, we've got to get into the body. &gt;&gt; So the body must be built up first. See, if this is Christ, the body must be built up first before we can place you in Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You cannot get into the body by joining. You know the prophet says this. You can't get into the body by handshake. &gt;&gt; You can't get into the body by membership. &gt;&gt; You have to be for ordained from before the foundation of the world to be in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; No man can call you into the body. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has to call you into the body and baptize you into the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; So how do we get into the body of Christ? Here's a scripture for the Amen. for you. Amen. the young ones, the old ones, whoever is writing this down. 1 Corinthians chapter 12. For as the body is one, and have many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For by one spirit, &gt;&gt; we are all baptized into one body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free and have been made to drink into one spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, we first have to come and the Holy Spirit has to baptize us into the body &gt;&gt; before we can be placed the body can be placed into Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that becoming more clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet saying adoption is placing the body into Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You're going to see how this ties up with the things we've been preaching. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, how do you place the body? Now, we we've just read how you get into the body, right? You can't come because of your father's revelation. &gt;&gt; You can't come because of your mother's revelation. The Holy Spirit has to quicken it to you and fill you with the Holy Ghost and baptize you into the body. &gt;&gt; You can try, you can try all you want to try and bring somebody into the message. You can try and speak to them about revelation upon revelation and see if they believe it or not. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has to do the quickening. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, how do you place the body of Jesus Christ in Christ? How do you join the top stone with the headstone? Right? The way you do it is by the Holy Spirit. We're going to read a scripture. Right? The same spirit that dwelt in the groom that made him the headstone is the same spirit that must be in us &gt;&gt; to make us the body of Christ to fit in. &gt;&gt; Amen. When all that happens, Amen. that is placing the body of Christ the wife positionally. So what are you saying? Before you can come to adoption, you've got to come through marriage. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Before you can be called the sons of God, you've got to come through marriage. &gt;&gt; Christ is not going to have a child of adoption out of wedlock. &gt;&gt; You first have to be united with Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So when that happens placing the body of Christ the wife positionally the marriage union gets us ready for the next step which is adoption and the invisible union. So you need to read messages like invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom with the earthly bride and messages like the marriage of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Let's read what the prophet is saying now. Secondly talking about the freefold mystery to have the preeminence in his body of believers. The same body of believers is going to be placed in Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For what? Here's the thing. Where does God want to live? In heaven. Somebody say in heaven. &gt;&gt; God wants to live in heaven. In this time and season. Where does he want to live? &gt;&gt; You hear what the prophet is saying? Christ the mystery. Christ the mystery is actually the prophet preaching the seven seal right he's saying have the preeminence in the body of believers that he might live in people &gt;&gt; where does God want to live &gt;&gt; people &gt;&gt; God wants to live in people &gt;&gt; Romans 8:11 but if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell where? &gt;&gt; In you. &gt;&gt; Remember, we're looking at how we get placed into Christ as a body. &gt;&gt; If the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell where? In you. &gt;&gt; He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Christ has come to dwell in you. And when the seventh seal opens or is broken, it places the body of Christ, the bride, changes the title to the wife and puts her in position in Christ to fulfill Ephesians 1:5. Now, if the body of Christ is not in position, which means the seventh seal is not open to people. The mystery of his coming is not open to people. &gt;&gt; They just in a message church. But like we've been saying, we are not called to a message church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are being called under the seventh seal &gt;&gt; to be placed positionally for adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the place we are called to is the headstone which is heavenly places in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew 25:10. Let's read it again. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, &gt;&gt; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut. Right. So Jesus has come. Christ has come to open the door to marriage. Took us in to be united with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the first connecting stone in this headstone was William Brham. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, when you're looking at the pyramid, come down. This pyramid is all the way inside &gt;&gt; because the flange &gt;&gt; must fit perfectly here. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's coming to a needle point. &gt;&gt; So, the first wave sheep who was waved over the people, &gt;&gt; the first son to come to maturity, &gt;&gt; the first son to come to adoption, &gt;&gt; his name was William Brandham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he was the first piece that went up here. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; And the teaching is if there's a first wave sheep over the people, it means there are many more to follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the rest are going to connect and come up here and connect and connect and find their place in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right now in the message, &gt;&gt; there are two classes of people. &gt;&gt; You're either inside the door. Yes, &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You're inside the door married to Christ the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And placed positionally for the adoption now seated in heavenly places or you are in the category of the foolish virgin &gt;&gt; trying to buy oil. &gt;&gt; You say what is oil? Brother Graham says oil is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But then he also tells you what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost. He's having a revelation &gt;&gt; of the word for your day. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So what are they trying to do? &gt;&gt; They're trying to get revelation. &gt;&gt; You see, it's easy when we say they're trying to get oil, &gt;&gt; but people are trying to get revelation. &gt;&gt; People are trying to get an understanding of the word, &gt;&gt; but they are locked out the door. You can only get true revelation, true understanding in the shikana glory if you come into the message, &gt;&gt; if you're coming through the door. Pay attention to that. Now, &gt;&gt; or another example, like we've been preaching is Queen Esther being married to the king, but too afraid to go into his presence. &gt;&gt; What category are we? &gt;&gt; Are we satisfied to say we're in the message? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Are we satisfied to say we're in the message of the hour, but two are free to come into the king? &gt;&gt; Amen. Esther chapter 5 shows us the door that's open to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A scepter is raised. &gt;&gt; She starts to unlock the favor of the king, the blessings of half the kingdom. She starts to plan and expose Amon. She starts to Amen. to change the law that's going to kill the Jews. All of this is happening where? under the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; under the coming of the Lord, &gt;&gt; he's tying it with the adoption. He's tying it with sitting together in heavenly places. Now, how do we access? Now, everyone understood that the mystery of his will is adoption. &gt;&gt; How do we get to adoption? Through marriage. &gt;&gt; Now, let's see. How do we access then the mystery of us sitting together in heavenly places? Sitting together in heavenly places. He's telling us heavenly places is the believer's position in Christ. &gt;&gt; Heavenly places, our wish at the time, I got it marked right here in my Bible about heavenly places. What is heavenly places? Heavenly places, just for a moment, is the believer's position in Christ. Where the believer stands in Christ? Heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that may sound casual to you. &gt;&gt; It's knowing your position. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. How do you know your position? You must be baptized into the body. &gt;&gt; And once you are baptized into the body, he says the Holy Spirit places you there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the prerequisite for accessing heavenly places is to access the mystery of his will, which is adoption. &gt;&gt; And how do we access the mystery of his will, adoption? We first must identify the mystery of his coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. M hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's all tied together. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; If we haven't accessed this, the mystery of his coming, we won't know the mystery of his will that he has come to adopt us. &gt;&gt; And if we don't know that he has come to adopt us, we won't know that we are supposed to be all the way up here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You go ask around. Message people think we're in the latest church age. &gt;&gt; Wednesday, for those of you who missed it, you missed a good sermon. Amen. The prophet is telling us that we are in the bride age. &gt;&gt; It's a hidden age. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a age they know nothing about. That's why you find people disputing about Revelation 10. Revelation 10 is not for the Gent, not for us. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not for you. &gt;&gt; Don't say us. &gt;&gt; Take out the S. Put you. &gt;&gt; Revelation 10 is not for them. &gt;&gt; No, this this cloud of 1963 has nothing to do with Revelation 10. &gt;&gt; But they're saying they believe the message. Let's see what this mystery of us sitting together in heavenly places is. What did brother Brandham now say? It is knowing our position in Christ. Did we just establish what our position in Christ is? &gt;&gt; We must first be baptized into the body and then be placed into Christ. Christ is the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we we first must be identified. I'm going to say it again for those that wasn't paying attention. In order to get to the last part, the mystery of sitting together, we first must unlock the mystery of his coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Once we unlock the mystery of his coming, he's going to tell us how he has taken us into a marriage and he's adopting us. &gt;&gt; That's the mystery of his will. &gt;&gt; And once we access the mystery of his will, he now takes us and he places us into the headstone. That's the mystery of sitting together in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; So, we may have taken our position and been baptized into the body. Here is where I'm getting to. People have been baptized into the body of Christ, saying, "I'm in the message. I'm in the message. I'm in the message." But now, the Holy Spirit must take the body and place it where? &gt;&gt; Being baptized into the body is not good enough. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying the Holy Spirit must take now that you that been placed into the body and place you in Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I know this is deep for some people, but I'm trying to take it as slow as I can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right now, make known unto us the mysteries of his will, the coming. Let me read you something. Let's go back to the pause, brother George. make known unto us the mystery of his will, the coming. Let me read something I was reading over. Let's turn all now over to the mystery of his will. &gt;&gt; The prophet is now going to define the mystery of his will. We said it was adoption. And he's saying, let's go to the seventh chapter of Hebrews. Hey, it sounds like the prophet is going to read the wrong scripture. Why would he want to read about Melzdc? Hebrews 7 is about Melzdc. &gt;&gt; And he's saying it's the mystery of his will. &gt;&gt; I'd like to read to you something that would just make you feel so good when you think of us sitting together in heavenly places. Hebrews the 7th chapter. &gt;&gt; Let's go on. For this Melzdc. Now watch. King of Salem, priest of the most high God. What's the mystery here? Now here's the mystery. Watch this. Who is this fellow making? knowing the mystery of his will. &gt;&gt; This Melzdc. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you mean this is him that came down? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He himself came down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This mystery. Here's the mystery. This fellow he is making and you are knowing &gt;&gt; the mystery of his will adoption. &gt;&gt; Oh church. Why is he tying Hebrews 7 with the mystery of us sitting together in heavenly places? Let's keep reading. Praise the Lord. Jesus was the fullness of God manifested. He was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. So, can we agree that he's saying Melzdc &gt;&gt; the word became flesh? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. He was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Therefore, when he came to earth, watching reveal the mystery of his will. Yeah. How many of you know you were here 2,000 years ago? &gt;&gt; When he came to earth and was manifested in the flesh, you were in him then. &gt;&gt; I can take you to Genesis 1 and show you Eve was there but she was you couldn't see her physically. &gt;&gt; She was in Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now when you're reading the gospels &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know when Jesus is walking and healing the sick, you are there in him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother Tyson, &gt;&gt; think of it. &gt;&gt; When Jesus went to the man who had no arm &gt;&gt; and he said, "Stretch forth thine hand." &gt;&gt; You are part of him. &gt;&gt; Hey, come on. You know how beautiful this teaching is. You know what? &gt;&gt; Watch what he just said. He said Jesus was the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; So if he is the fullness of the word, you and I are part of the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; So which means the complete revelation of God was in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let me say it another way. The complete word was locked up in Jesus. And I'm a part of the word. You're a part of the word. So when Jesus was manifested, I was manifested though not seen with my physical eye, but I was locked up in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Jesus walked the shores of Galilee and when he walked upon water, I walked upon water because I was in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see the mystery of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mystery of us sitting together in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when he was here, &gt;&gt; I was here. &gt;&gt; When he came to the earth and was manifested in flesh, you were here in him. Hey, so nice. When he came and he multiplied the fish and loaves, &gt;&gt; I was a part of that. If I was not part of him, then Jesus was partial word. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a strong statement. &gt;&gt; But he was the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. &gt;&gt; The word was with God. The word was God. And the word became flesh and dwelt amongst us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So all through Jesus life, he's carrying a hidden mystery inside of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's carrying the hidden mystery of the bride. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. If you're reading Genesis 1, before Adam is put into a flesh body, Adam is carrying the mystery of Eve locked up inside of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam is having authority over the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam is speaking to winds. Adam is speaking to waves. Adam is speaking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you mean when you mean that mystery of why Jesus is trying to tell us Mark 11:23 is because we had amnesia? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus went to the tree, &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; we were in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now he comes to tell you how to operate like that. Praise the Lord. Let's keep reading. How many of you enjoying this? &gt;&gt; Amen. This is our climax, so you better enjoy it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Therefore, when he came to the earth and was manifested in flesh, you were in him then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he was the word. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God. And the word was God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. The word was made flesh. Therefore, you walked with him. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; When you were in him, when he was on earth, &gt;&gt; you suffered with him. &gt;&gt; Hey, I hope you got strong stomach lining. Please don't tell me your ulcers are flaring up now because this food here is not agreeing with your digestive system. If that's you this morning, I want you to do what the prophet did when he was proclaiming his heal. He said that food was coming up &gt;&gt; and he swallowed it back down. &gt;&gt; If you can't digest it, swallow it back down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You suffered with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You died with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You buried with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now you are risen with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Manifested attributes of God sitting in heavenly places already raised &gt;&gt; resurrected to new life. &gt;&gt; Sitting in heavenly places in Jesus Christ. Oh, that means so much nowadays church. That means so much to us to see ourselves positionally placed in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm not of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was expressed into time. I'm not of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We must be there. We must be the church, the bride of Christ. I lived with him on the earth when he lived. I died with him when he died. I rose with him when he rose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I assembled and I'm seated with him now in heavenly places because I'm part of him. Wherever he is, there I am. &gt;&gt; Go listen to the scripture we took when we preached manifest. Call to the headstone to manifest. What did Jesus say? that where I am, you may be also. And we showed you Christ is now in the headstone. So, you've got to be where he is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I'm part of him. Wherever he is, there I am. Where my servant is, there will I be also. That's John chapter 12 he's quoting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, he can fellowship with us and through us and rest his word with us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where's he resting his word? &gt;&gt; Let's read that again. Now he can fellowship with us. Do you know if you're part of the Leadyian church age, Christ can't fellowship with you? &gt;&gt; Do you know if you're outside the throne room where Esther was, he can't fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; Do you know if you're outside the door where Christ has opened the door, he can't fellowship with you. Right. &gt;&gt; He can fellowship with us and through us and rest his word with us. &gt;&gt; Which we are a part of his word. If he is the word, we are part of him. Then we are part of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you church, I'm closed now. But I tell you this, &gt;&gt; don't be part of the nom nominal church, message church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll get left behind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You will get left behind. That's true. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because foolish virgin &gt;&gt; is not denomination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Denomination is not virgin. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go read the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that a mother is a harot. &gt;&gt; Sorry, a &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the daughter is a prostitute. &gt;&gt; How many of you saw a virgin prostitute? &gt;&gt; That's right. Believe them. Amen. &gt;&gt; So where you going to find the virgins? &gt;&gt; So don't be satisfied with saying I'm called to the message. &gt;&gt; I believe the message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I believe the prophet. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; That's going to get you nowhere. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's a start. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But don't stop there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Get into Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. What was the key? I'm going to summarize now. How do Let's see. The prophet said, if you put up that first quote, brother Josh, we'll summarize with how we started and let's see if we now understand his quote. Praise the Lord. The first quote, you got it. Jesus said, he says, he made known unto us the mystery of his will. &gt;&gt; Get the Holy Spirit on you sometime. Start running that and just watch how it goes. This afternoon, I had about 15 minutes between the times. Amen. Go. And I got to running and I thought, how mysterious the scripture packed me back and tied something together to see the mystery of his coming. &gt;&gt; The mystery of his will, adoption. &gt;&gt; And the mystery of us sitting together. &gt;&gt; The mystery of us sitting together. What is adoption? the Holy Spirit taking the body of Christ and placing it in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you miss the shout, you miss the rapture. &gt;&gt; What is the shout? Did we read that the shout is going to gather the people together? &gt;&gt; And then did we read a second quote to say the seven thunders gather us together? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So maybe you've been sitting here wondering now if you knew that the seven thunders was going to give you rapturing faith and we're telling you that the seven thunders is the sharp message going forth. Can we still leave that book there lying like that when what's in that book is going to give us rapturing faith? No. This book has maybe how many pages with it, George? 20 pages, 30 pages. Thin book. Thin book. Here's an movie. 1 hour. Uh, choice to make. Do I read the book? Do I watch the movie? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. No. You know, I'm so tired. I came from work. I got to eat. You know, if you're really hungry for God, ask these brothers what they used to do &gt;&gt; in their lunchtime, they'll eat their lunch and read. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Put your hands up, brothers, if you did that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want the younger people to see that you did that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who did that? Put your hands up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what I'm saying where you place value, sometimes you'll even say, you know what, I don't want to eat right now. Let me read this thing first. But that's how you're going to know. You can't say, "I love Jesus. I love Jesus." And you don't love his word. Hey, I feel like I'm sounding like Pastor Ronnie right now. You can't say you love Jesus. You love Jesus. And you don't love his word. &gt;&gt; You don't spend time with him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, how many of you I'm not going to judge you or ask you a question. I'm saying how many of you are going to value what we have even more knowing that it is the seven thunders. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That's giving us faith for rapture. &gt;&gt; And it lies in these things that we are reading to position us. &gt;&gt; Now quick as one two three I want you to say put your hand up right as soon as I say this. Put your hand up and the first one will get a prize. How many of you want to miss the rapture? Nobody. And the key for not missing the rapture is this message. &gt;&gt; Yes. What are you doing with Jesus on your hands? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Will you be guilty of rejecting the word &gt;&gt; or will you not come up and ascend to heavenly places? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Appreciate what has been given to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I ask you again, what you're hearing right now, the Holy Spirit is revealing this to us &gt;&gt; to position us and get us ready for that body change. &gt;&gt; Without this, we're not going. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Shut in with God in the secret place. There in his presence, belowing his face, I'm gaining the power to ride in this race. I love to be shing with God. Oh sh with God. Shing with God in the sing. &gt;&gt; All there in his presence. There in his presence, the holy. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Come on, church of God. You're giving you power. [Music] I love to be shal. Let's just raise our hands and say shut in with God. [Music] Oh church, &gt;&gt; hear the Holy Spirit call. &gt;&gt; This is the word to give you power. Yes, in his presence. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, new power is coming to us. &gt;&gt; How does power come by knowing our position? &gt;&gt; I love to be shouting. One more time, let's sing with God. [Music] &gt;&gt; We are shutting, oh God, with you. &gt;&gt; Sealed away from the world, oh God. Sealed away from the things of the world, oh God. In his presence, we glory again. Give you power to run this. I love to be shing with God. Amen. Can we just talk to the Lord and give him praise? Give him glory. Amen. Just worship him. Just give him praise. Just thank him. Amen. That he's called us. &gt;&gt; That he's revealed the mystery of his coming to us. He's revealed the mystery of his will to us and he's revealed to us the mystery of sitting together in heavenly places. Amen. Oh, just start to thank the Lord. Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord. Amen. Thank you. Amen. Glory be holy name. Thank you, Jesus. Revelation of your word, oh God. Thank you, Lord, for revealing it to us, oh God. Oh, flesh and blood has not revealed this to us. Oh, but our father has revealed us to us. &gt;&gt; has come to dwell in the hearts of his people. &gt;&gt; We give you glory and praise, oh God. &gt;&gt; To know, oh God, we are seated with you right now, oh God. We have taken our position as the bride body, Father, to welcome back the headstone. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We give you glory, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We give you honor, Father. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh worthy is his name. &gt;&gt; Worthy is his name. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord this journey. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh we love to be shut in with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Love to be shut in. &gt;&gt; Glory glory glory glory glory. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; You say maybe why didn't you preach a sermon amen to empower me. &gt;&gt; You missed the sermon &gt;&gt; to know your position gives you authority and power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is power being given to the church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When you take away the amnesia &gt;&gt; to show that you are as eternal as God is eternal. &gt;&gt; When God thought about the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world. Think of a church. If you had to think of making a sacrificial lamb, who would you have to think of first? You would have to think of the one who fell first before I can think of how I'm going to redeem that person. So, he is the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And my name was put in that book of life from before the foundation of the world. I have eternal qualities about me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's thought about me was before he he thought about creating heavens and earth. &gt;&gt; Think about it again. Genesis 1 says, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." But the Bible is telling me that he put my name before the foundation of the earth. &gt;&gt; So before God said, "Let there be," he already thought of me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Do you know you're a very part of God &gt;&gt; right now? Start to access that anointing. &gt;&gt; Start to access that anointing within you. &gt;&gt; Why I'm asking you to access that anointing. &gt;&gt; You are amateur gods on the earth right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we have all these prayer requests. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; As God spoke in the beginning and said, "Let there be. I want you to activate your corporate anointing now as the body of Christ." &gt;&gt; Sister Victory not well. She's got a muscle problem. Amen. Pain in her arm. She went for an injection yesterday. Amen. But was with extreme pain even through the night. Couldn't make it for service this morning. Many believers unwell in body. Couldn't make it for service this morning. Amen. You're trusting God for a miracle. You're trusting God for a job. You're trusting God for promotion. You're trusting God for a marriage partner. I am saying right now, you can activate it and speak a word over your situation right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The power don't lie in the preacher. The power lies in you believing the preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The power lies in you believing the word. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I'm asking you right now to take these needs to the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm asking you. Amen. I'm not going to ask any individual to pray, but I'm going to ask all of you to pray. Amen. Do you know that some people are lost, some people are trapped, &gt;&gt; and you have the power to call them in? &gt;&gt; You have the power right now. Like sister said, I ask for the salvation of my two boys. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know if you meet the same conditions right now, you can ask for the salvation of your children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Maybe your children are not showing interest. Your children are weward. Your family member is weward. God has given you this power right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with it, church? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's pray together, church. Amen. Take your needs to the Lord. Take your burdens to the Lord. Let's sing. Leave it there. Leave it there. While you'all are playing that, I want the church to start to pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Let's start to pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You got these prayer requests. You've heard. Amen. All these prayer requests. I want you to activate the power of a spoken word that's within
