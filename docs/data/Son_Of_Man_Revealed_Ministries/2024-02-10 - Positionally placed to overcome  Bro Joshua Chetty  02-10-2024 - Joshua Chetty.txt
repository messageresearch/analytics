Jesus Christ amen I miss you all on Sunday I wasn't with you but God knows why we had to go on two different battlefronts Ministry to God and two Battlefront but the Lord Knows Why amen amen and I believe it's uh strategic amen the Holy Ghost does things strategically amen but it was a blessing to be out there to preach at Pastor Dan's assembly on Sunday the Believers they were blessed and I heard the good report from that Jo were blessed out there and on Sunday as well so we know that God is doing a great thing amen amen and he's doing it all over the world amongst his bride amen amen you know the prophet of God says in in the message where I think Pentecost feely said oh sometimes we meod us get noise confused with anointing now noise ain't anointing no no I've seen where there's a lot of noise and not fi enough to cure to take yes see you got to come solemnly to the father you've got to know exactly where you are standing amen now we know we've seen lot of noise there there's nothing wrong to have noise in the house of God there's nothing wrong to have Fellowship but sometime they can just be noise and noise without the anointing yes then he said in another message he says now look a while ago when the Holy Spirit was falling that was the blessings of the Lord now this you see operating this way is the power of the Lord he said that's blessings don't get blessings and power mixed up yes you can have a blessing and not power enough to cure a two but power of the Lord is to manifest God Amen see what I mean the power of the lord and there was people out there that doesn't sorry that's what I was trying to say but the power of the Lord is to manifest God yes now you was to take the book to eat the book right right but we had the the word in the Zodiac we had the word in the pyramid we had the written word Jesus himself was the manifested word yes and in this hour it's the body of Christ must become the manifestation of the word every word that every promise that you're eating you there must be a manifestation of their promise man the reason why I read this quote I'll tell you why now let me just ask my wife are you feeling okay it's good fine I'm just going to read a testimony that I just I just came out to have a shower and my wife was giving me the chest I couldn't really hear what you're saying so much I said you know what do me a favor getting ready out for church just WhatsApp it to me and I'll read it I'll give you a testimony to the church so this is what a testimony was he said I was listening to the prophet and he was saying he was saying that we need to identify ourselves with the Bible that I was with Moses when he part of the red scene I was with the three Hebrew boys I was with David when he was rejected by his Brethren he said that we shouldn't have amnesia and know our identity he called a prayer line in the end and all through the message I had my hand on my face to e ease the pain I had on my tooth now I know from yesterday she had a terrible tooth and she was really suffering it so she think she listened to the message but she had a hand on her her face because of the to he said the prophet then said the lady with your hand in her face and went on to tell her her trouble he said it was different from mine but I identified myself with her to receive my healing he said few minutes later the pain left amen so that is taking having faith in God's word amen amen amen that's the wife's testimony today so she's sitting here now without any to but you had a terrible to take while listen to message amen amen so we praise God that we have a practical God Amen we we we seeing the the the gospel being practical it might be so simple in your house it might not be in a religious setup yes but everything that we preaching we we're not just preaching these things these are practical things we preaching amen amen so we seeing this word becoming manifested thank you amen so stand to our feet and we read the scripture tonight we all excited to be in the house of God amen amen so while it's raining here it's also raining missiles in Israel but we know there's also before all those things happen in the natural everything must happen in the Supernatural amen because there a spiritual bride that's rising up in power yes and all the enemies got the targets pointed at her M because she's the only enemy right now amen she's Satan's number one target amen famous portion of scripture Ephesians chapter 1 reading from verse 3 to 6 and our appropriate in this hour in hour of maturity amen he said blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ when blessed us with all spiritual blessings amen he Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of of his world amen amen you may be SE now we know to the caral mind being a Christian they say being a Christian is just a struggle that's a normal caral mind the thing in life we know it's you have to go to the ttings and things like that but the normal car man say no we just have to struggle against the enemy but they don't realize it's more than that amen we know we have to overcome but it's more than that amen because we placed you on a journey of being positionally placed in Christ to overcome yes amen from the time we we we come into Christ we placed on a journey amen because remember from the time man fell in the Garden of Eden the Journey of redemption started yes amen but each one of us when we were manifested on the earth we had to go on this journey from the time we receive Christ amen from the time we become awakened and we receive the new birth we come to accept Christ as our personal savior then we go to the new birth and so forth but we are going on a journey to be POS of being positionally placed in Christ for what to overcome the enemy amen amen because the enemy he was there put there to Mar the plan of God what he thought that he was overcoming Maring the plan of God but what he didn't realize he was created for God attributes to be manifested yes amen amen and part of God attribute was to be a savior but a bigger part of that for him to be a savior yet to have attributes of him yes yes which is you and I amen we are attributes of God that's why we are partakers of his divine nature yes so if overcoming requires us to understand our spiritual position in Christ amen now you can't it's easy to say overcome overcome we must be Overcomers in this day it's easy to I come I say we all must just be Overcomers we are meant to be Overcomers how are you going to do that without the message coming and showing you what is your position without the opening of the word coming this hour yes to show you because you didn't know outside of message you didn't know where you come from you didn't know that the gene of God was within you you didn't know that you always was part of God because coming from organization and denominational teaching you just believe salvation just to be saved from hell yeah that's what you was that taught out there but when you come into the knowledge of the truth you realize that you always was part of God Amen that you are son and daughter of God to be manifested on earth yes that God had in himself that he wants to have a family amen and there had to be a time when his family had to be manifested you always was with him but there had to be a time where you had God had to express his thoughts out amen you have to become the express image of Christ yes yes amen amen so we just speaking tonight on being positionally placed to overcome the enemy amen amen so we want to be positionally placed to overcome the enemy because I believe that right now we not on a picnic amen we not Pentecostal babes yes sir we're not here just trying to drink skin milk this is a mature church amen amen and to be mature or when you come at the stage of M Authority no more is this going to start throwing gifts at you throwing Pentecostal baby gifts at you yes now there's a responsibility for you you are responsible to go and work to earn to get amen all day is provide all day is given to you those are your rewards sorry that's your inheritance all inance belongs to you but you are required to work amen you want to go like Joshua and possess the land amen then you must go there and defeat the enemy the angel of God is going before you but you must go and physically do something amen amen this is not a time to come and say no I'm not the preacher I'm just the church member and I will just come and listen to the preacher you got your part to play in this Kingdom you got to be positionally placed to your position in the Kingdom amen amen because every one of us got a responsibility whether you are the one that's helping to make the ammunition whether you are the one that's setting getting the weapons ready and passing it to to the preacher by maybe in spiritual warfare maybe you're an intercessor amen you got to support the ministry in the part that you got to play yes you got to identify your position in the body of Christ amen amen amen now when we are positionally placed we know then then we have exess to the authority yes amen and all the blessings and strength to withstand every attack of the enemy because trust me the enemy is going to come to you suddenly that's why it says be instant in season out of season right and that's why you pray with all type of prayers that mean you got all way have a prayerful life amen amen you have to to be an overcomer you got to have a a back of the desert you got to have your training ground in the back of the desert you don't come and train in front of the enemy amen you don't you don't have to go to the enemy and start now trying to figure out what you're going to pray for when you are facing a situation listen to what I'm saying now you might be put in a situation where your loved one got cancer where your loved one is demon possessed they need Deliverance you're not going to go there and learn try to figure out what type of prayer you're going to pray that's what your training ground is for you go you go in your Wilderness experience you go and study the word you go and spend time in your closet in prayer because there's going to be a time where you're going to face the enemy and then you better walk out there as a person in Authority amen Jesus did not go there and Min his word with the Devil with demons the apostles did not come there and Min their words with demon Spirits the the prophet of God you watch the prayer line You'll saw that compared to denominational preachers he didn't me his words he spoke as one with authority to cancer cases to TV cases to life and dead situations amen because he knew he is he knew his position in Christ he knew his backing amen he knew his mandates so we got got to know why we are placed here in this hour amen so we got to know our position in Christ you got to start off by that way Amen in the book of Colossians 2:10 it says and here I complete in him which is the head of all principality and power so why are you afraid of little IM amen when he when he is the head of everything and you are coair with Christ and you are the body because he is the head of the church and the body and the and and and the head is together now because it's coming invisible Union and if you are in that invisible the head now is the head of all principality and power you are able to withstand every demon power so it starts off with first knowing your position in Christ amen you're not striving to attain that position but you are positionally placed through predestination amen amen amen he already predestinated you in that way he predestinated you to be part of the Bride you do not go by your intellect looking for a message you do not go looking saying is there something more that I can find and maybe go study the Book of Revelation you don't even know anything but the seals out of this message but you are predestinated to be born in this season you are pred that someday the light will come your way amen and God has preserved Us in his hour because this is the hour where there's going to be a people that's going to be changed from Mortal to immortality amen there's going to be a people that will not see Debs yes Amen in this hour amen he kept you and preserved you for this hour L and why you are to be kept for this hour if if you are meant to go in the rapt what type of person you are to be what type of position you should being in right now whatever Fai you've been walking in but you were predestinated for that amen that's why you find that so if you know that God predestinated you right and Christ already overcome Satan amen so that mean if you overcome Satan already then you already know the end result then you already know that you walking in Victory amen amen then you are placed in a position that will be a Victorious One amen you're not you're not going there and guessing what will happen in a certain circumstance you already know that you having a Victorious situation amen you can because you are placed in a position to have the victory amen and this is not based on our merits amen praise be to God and thank God for that it is based on the work of Christ amen amen amen but what makes it unique is because of a union is because of the Oneness amen that we become part of him that he dwell that's why I say the the spirit is calling that there must be us letting off and he completely comes and then from the outside he's been completely expressed in s so when you find that when you find that part now when we find our position we no longer fighting from a place of defeat amen yes you're not you're no longer on the back foot you're no longer in presuming amen what the result will be yes if he is the same yesterday today and forever this God that already defeated cancer cases amen if you already know the position and where he's been so you already know what the end result is going to be then we don't look and we know that this bride has to make a body have a body change so we don't look at a position of defeat amen yes we look at it and we don't focus on our weaknesses amen because the Bible said his strength is made perfect in our weakness yes amen amen so we don't rely on ourselves but we look from when coming our help and know that I have com from the Lord amen amen you looking at yourself and say no Lord my bank balance is running low yes that is your bank balance but you ever looked at his bank balance amen because if you are in a position of maturity then he's given you a blank check he's given you signing Powers amen then that means you're not Ling on your Earthly material things now but you're lying on Jehovah Gyra your provider amen amen amen so you realize that you are relying on him amen amen thank you amen we speaking about our being positionally placed to overcome the enemy it starts off by knowing your position in Christ thank you Lord you're not having identity crisis amen yes amen I don't think we we should be you know what identity crisis Lord am I saved Lord did I pray enough oh Lord I'm remembering my past sins oh Lord I did this things in the P how many times you asking for forgiveness for that then you are now trebling on the blood of Jesus you believe now there's no power in the blood that can wash away your sins amen that's the devil coming in your mind and reminding you because he's the accuser of the Brethren right he always wants to remind you of your failures in the flesh amen amen amen thank you don't let him do that show him who you are in the word amen amen don't have identity crisis in this hour amen because yeah you in a battle you better know that you're in the army of God Amen you better know your position in his War amen cuz the battle is ring right now amen you better know how to use your weapons amen then you got to understand in this hour that in this age of adoption when we receive the spirit of adoption in this hour you've got to recognize that for you to be adopted in this hour you can't remain a child amen while the churches are here yes who's the is the Holy Ghost and how is the Holy Ghost you could see it's easy to say it's the Holy Ghost but here's the hard part for people to see Beyond the Veil and recognize how the Holy Ghost is working through Shooters God always uses man amen amen and if you're saying the Holy Ghost is a shooter then where is the Holy Ghost working through in this hour he's got the 54 Ministry amen amen amen and now the more Ministry days to bring you is to encourage you through the word to positionally place you through the word to teach you and build you up yes to take you out of bondage and fear yes amen cuz the enemy is giving you identity crisis the enemy is showing you fleshly things emotional things the enemy is playing with the five senses then he's playing with your emotions and so forth he's playing with the mind you got to work with Faith amen because without faith is impossible to please God yes Romans 8:15 says for you have not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear that's what the enemy wants to do he wants to hold you in bondage yes and that's why he's holding your brothers and sisters in bondage that's why they are fearful they don't realize they in bondage by the enemy that's why they're focusing on the things of the flesh where they feel like oh Lord I'm so far gone I can't come back to church I want to put my leg in the church but my other leg is in Egypt amen stuck in Leia because you know why the enemy is showing them no you can't go in church you're too far going now you spend too long be but that's the spirit of bondage yes now what the Bible says what so whatever you shall loose on Earth shall be Loos in heaven amen whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven amen so you on a spiritual battle now you got brothers and sisters that are in bondage but you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but they have received the spirit of adoption amen whereby we cry AB father now to overcome the enemy you got to come to that amen you've got to come to your placement yes you want to overcome the enemy you've got to come to your placement amen Joshua to positionally place the people into their inheritance amen that's why you'll find the ministry will keep telling you you got to know your position you got to come to your position you got to you can't stay the same you can't remain same in that condition you know some people there seem to be no sense of urgency in s i mean you're watching you know you know what it reminds me of if you look at natural Israel they were so used to Rockets being launched there every day the people in Israel it become so common to them Rockets were La every only the the only difference was they wouldn't feel it because they got this Dome Iron Dome you know it's like the ministry coming and preaching to them every week but now when different mes are coming now they were so used to they they didn't realize our seed is the SE because if you look at the amount of mes that came to e to Israel right now it could actually destroy the all of Israel if it landed there if it all exploded there but this bride wouldn't fall amen how many enemies are coming how many targets are coming at us right now we amen the prophet of God said not one bomb will fall on us amen that's right remember this is the bride now this is the wife of Jesus Christ but we're talking about now there's still people now that you are trained God is training you in the of a reason you might wonder why God is equiping you in a in a different way why why is he cing you and giving you word very strategically and showing you the way you should go now in this overcoming power and how to go in this battle yeah there's a reason that is why you you you can't just take it you've got to be sensitive you got to be sensitive to the way what the spirit is saying and understand why he strategically bringing certain type of messages to you amen is he coping you for a reason because you got brothers and sisters that are I felt they far too long gone but they out there and God cares about them you might think God God given up on them he hasn't given up on them amen maybe you have given up on them but God hasn't given up on them amen but we find that when we come to our placement and we know our rights and Authority amen then we speak then we have the power now to speak and act in Christ's name amen then we have the authority and realize that now we are joint a with him according to the Bible in Revelation 8:17 and then we realize now we can take our in now we can take every promise that the Bible speaks about because why when you come to adoption then you have the legal rights to overcome the enemy because before that before that you're not a mature son to exercise those rights maybe you placed in the church your son you're growing up therefore you could say now I need to call the pastor to pray for the situation I need to call that brother to call pray for the situ but now you might be caught up where you can't call the pastor yeah you can't call the brother amen so when you going to come to your maturity amen because now you are placed here in the hour the it's not just the pastor's role is to CP you and if the pastor is coping you because he's putting you to go he's giving you the instruction as the pastor you go there in the Battlefront amen T not the pastor's duty to go out there his job is to equip you and lead you and say this is what you need to do this is what you need to do then you need to go there now with they equipment that you got and use it am amen you get what I'm saying amen amen but now for you to exercise that right now you got to to for you to have that legal right to overcome the enemy you got to recognize that you have to come to the state of maturity you can't be complacent you can't be in the same situation over and over amen it's a war yes and when there's a war on life is not normal yeah life is not normal you in know what time you can't say I'm going on a holiday okay you're all fighting the bombs are going on my country is in war right now the bombs are flaring I'll go have an holiday in the beach I'm talking about spiritually speaking now you follow what I'm saying you going to have a c life of Prayer and dedication to the things of God yes a time of keep going into his word getting encouraged by his word amen he's given us all of his word the prophet of God says you think cancer is something the Bible said there is coming a time when men will rot in their flesh and the buzzers will eat of their cus before they even die he said cancer is a toake to what's coming but so if he saying that why are we afraid of cancer yet cancer is like the number one enemy for medical science right now but he's saying it's like a twoot to what's coming but remember that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those who had the Seal of God he said that's what we striving for now to get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of God before these horrible plagues strike amen amen then he says how was our inheritance given to us through what predestination predestination is for knowledge how did God know he could trust you to be a creature is for knowledge not that not he that will it or he that run it it's God that showeth Mercy amen that's right predestination he knew what was in you he know what was in you before you even come on the earth amen he know what sorry he know what was in you before there was an Earth for you to come on that's him that's the infinite God we are finite we can only think finite you see the caral mind if you going to think with your caral mind you want understand the things of God you got to come to the mind of Christ amen you got to see things to the eyes of God's word yes that's why when you see the what's happening around the world if you look at it kind like everybody else you'll be hey there's a why is not stopping what is happening the we're having this situation in America we having this situation in Russia you look at it your caral minds but when you got when you look at God's word you'll see what the seals was open what was revealed the opening of the word Reveals All the Things To Us you can see who's working behind the scenes you can see what is happening yes amen there you got to come to full submission Amen to God's word amen you want the five Ministry preaching your pastor is preaching to you the 5old ministry is preaching to you you got to submit to that word it's it's it's uh futile if preaching is being is preached to you but you're not submissive to that word amen because that word is training ground that's your training it's teaching you it's equipping you so you got to submit to it you got to now take that what is you got to be sensitive and realize Lord you are speaking through me through that Veil amen but if you keep looking at the veil and not look at God speaking to you then you're going to be kind you're not going to get anything from God so you got to be submissive to God's word coming through you which is your training and and he's trying to make you mature so you got to be submissive to that amen am amen cuz he's bringing you to a mature State he he's growing you up from a baby he grew you up from infant stage adolescent now you come to a mature stage yes you come to infancy Desiring the sincere milk happy happy gol lucky you never said because you're happy now you're new believer then you come to adolescence the whole world is against you then you're bickering fighting with your brothers so forth all the all the F come but now we come to a mature church now amen in a mature church you can say oh brother I forgive you for that it's okay brother I saw I shouldn't have saw saw it that way or I shouldn't have said you that spoken to you in that way amen your speech changes yes you speak more maturely amen Galatians 4:12 says now I say that the air as long as your child defer nothing from a servant though ye be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of his father we know the prophet always spoke to us he said the believer can fully exercise for a Believer to exercise his full pos position they must go through this process of training Amen to the tutors it's not there's no shortcut to God no amen you can have a shortcut in your in the secular School in your world system but you can't have a shortcut to God Amen you got to come to the full process amen cuz God soldiers are elite soldiers this is an invincible Army this is a super church this is a super race you already predestinated to be that so if you predes that's the end result then you must go through every part even if you go away with it's going to bring you in if you have to break your leg you break your leg and how break your leg through the word through the five4 ministry amen love is corrective amen but you're not getting lost amen and if if you throw you away by Satan for a while send you away till you go on your knees and realize true repentance amen oh yes amen sometimes you got to bring you back to the altar yes amen so you must go through the process of training and you can't hide through it amen amen and we know that as a child you won't give the child any responsibility at each stage of the child's life as they getting more mature you give them a little bit more responsibility amen as you get more mature you get them more responsibility yes amen you say when you come to anyone we give you a key in other words we giving you you we see you mature now you can handle things you can go and you come and like we have trust and confidence in you so until until much is given much is required the more the more exess is given to you the more Authority is given you that means more is required from you amen yes so sometimes when you get all this nice things that God is speaking to you and you getting this nice word week after week from your pastor then you might need to get a B worried because now there's a bigger responsibility the Bible says that and so much is given much is required amen amen so you get excited say I've got all this there's a reason okay in the Army you got different soldiers right different for different forms of soldiers but you also get special special soldiers elite soldiers your special forces and so forth right they can they go to different types of training there's a bigger responsibility on them amen because why they went to more better training than the other soldiers they went to training that other soldiers don't know of some sometimes they do some covert operations and it's very secretive and the the type of training they receive not everybody knows that is not revealed to everybody else yes so much is given much is required amen but as you come to discipline and to this process of maturity you realize that he's preparing you to handle to handle the word with responsibility and is if I could put it this way is to handle your Spiritual Authority that's given to you amen yes amen you know how to go and face up a situation sometime you might wonder why Lord why am I going through the situation God allows certain things to come maybe your own family member went to certain sicknesses and so forth you went to some trials and tesy God is allowing these things to mature you God put you to trials and testing for a reason and you might wonder why you're going through it but the Bible says not some things he said all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord and according to his purpose amen so you might say but God is giving you the training grounds the situations in your life to overcome bigger situations oh he's giving you the small things to overcome because if you can't overcome the Small Things how you going to overcome the big amen how you going to be an overcomer for the age itself amen and to overcome it because you are the people that called not to meet a rap take a Rapture you are called to defy all the laws of gravity and so forth amen amen amen 1 Samuel 17 you can open to that 1 Samuel 17: 34 to 37 he speaking about David here and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock so he's talking about two in two different incidents David is sharing his training ground because David now before he had to face Goliath David had to overcome other obstacles right that was his training ground not front of now remember before he fa Israel and does what he has to do in front of Israel where it can be now this is the king of Israel the king of Israel before that situation comes that everyone is going to see this overcoming now he had some personal overcoming that nobody saw Amen in the wilderness overcoming a lion overcoming a bear nobody saw it but he testifying of it amen but now that was his personal experience but from his personal experience Watch What Happens now he says and David so he told to Saul and took a lamb out of the flock and I went after him and smot him and delivered it out of his mouth when he arose against me and I caught him by his beard and smot him and slew him thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he had defied the armies of the Living God David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the Paw of the lion and out of the pow of the bay he will deliver me out of the hand of the Philistines amen you see he knows his position David is being positionally placed amen but he had to go to different experiences on the training ground even when no one was watching between him and God Amen and he knew that God was with him yes amen but remember this is an anointed servant of God he was anointed amen yes and he watch after the anointing comes upon him now he's watching God being with him and he's overcoming the enemy and now those way training ground but now in the midst of Israel when Israel now is so Fe fearful amen when the brothers are fearful of the things that are happening around them when the brothers don't have the confidence anymore they are afraid of gol they're afraid of what's happening on the Earth right now David now is going to take what is equipped to it what happened in the wilderness and he goes in the midst now in front of his Brethren now the thing that the Brethren are afraid of Amen the golad that is the mid of them whether the golad is the sickness whether the GOL is is some kind of obstacle spiritually speaking does David is going to overcome this gol now in front of his Brethren amen so we find that we know the story how David eventually because of his position because of his confidence amen that in 1 Samuel 17:45 to 46 is actually prophesying before y over comes he saying in 45 it says then said David to the Philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel which thou has defiled this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand and I will smite thee and take thine head from thee and I will give the cus of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beast of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel now this never happened yet but what David is prophesying or what he's going to do because what he's speaking is going to be manifested amen do you hear what I'm saying when a person knows their position thou must prophesy again amen amen when you know your prayer as pastan preach your prayer must become prophecy amen so before this before the Manifest ation is speaking it amen amen and what he speaks now becomes manifested in the end results amen so David showed the children of Israel what overcoming is all about amen so we find that even our trials amen it's all our God's great plan to develop our faith to bring us into a faith amen it's all it's all our training ground it might have in our quiet times it might happen in our personal space amen but God is equipping us for the things that will happen out there amen amen thank you Lord so you might find that sometimes God blesses you in Little Things David was faithful in protecting the Sheep yes he wasn't a king then he was just protecting the Sheep he was a Shepherd but you know even Luke 16 10 says Jesus is saying he who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much you see you might be in a small little position in the body you might think it's not so significant but God is watching you God is watching your faithfulness amen whether you you holding a certain uh you're part of the government of the church whether you a church whether your a Believer coming and supporting the fellowship whether you interceding privately God is watching your faithfulness in what he's called you to do yes you've got to be faithful in the things you got to be a good Steward in the kingdom of God Amen what is's appointed you to do you got to be a good Steward you be faithful in his little things and then he will Elevate you into your next position amen [Music] amen amen I'm thinking about the brothers I remember I'm remembering this pastor Adrian and so forth they were playing music from from Young days they were faithful in their Ministry then it was a Ministry that they have that this is my Ministry they know that they had a responsibility watch and I watch their life because they knew they had a responsibility amen that they play music and they they know that I got to be in church playing music I got to be in practice I got to practice for the things of God and you watch The Life and you'll find that you got to be faithful in the little things for God where God is leading you amen God must take you to the little things first he must take you to your training ground so you find that he might have had in his personal space he's fighting for his sheep because that was all symbols there God sh him the greater thing because he is going to be the shepherd of Israel amen but now it's no longer going to be David and his personal space he's fighting for this Victory now this Victory is going to be benefited in all of of Israel so you're little ching Ground God is healing you in your home he's healing you for these things he's building your faith up thank you making you walk to perfect Faith amen he's building you up to a place of perfect Faith might be your personal space might be in a little assembly but God's going to use it one of these days these all the training ground he's going to use it to the benefit for the entire Army thank you thank you Lord hope you can see what I'm saying what I'm saying you could be positionally placed in the hour for others Deliverance am yes don't look at yourself and say oh I'm spiritually matur that person backl oh I can sing this in the word and they can't see you are being placed for other people's Deliverance amen you are being saved so you can go and rescue them take them out of fear take them out of bondage the bondage that come upon them is putting them in fear yes don't let them have identity chis tell them their identity the prophet gave that illustration of that soldier that lost his mind and they had to take him on a path and he's following him walking walking walking until eventually he could find his identity amen amen he could take him out of Amnesia amen some people are trapped in Amnesia they're forgetting who they are they're forgetting what God called them amen they're forgetting how God call him and out they first was rejoicing with his message and let see sh them it's time for these people to be delivered amen yes could God be positioning his little flock for others [Music] Deliverance could he be doing that amen could he be equipping the year from 23 to 24 now it's is coming to the end of the year it's in October now and remember speaking of October October the 7th was it 7 17 or 7th 7 that's one year now since natural Israel were taken to hostage so the victory that you see might not will you might not see it right now God is placing you it'll be the victory for the benefit of the body the victory will be for the benefit of the body amen he could be placing positionally placing you now so the body will benefit because others must come in the Homeland others must come into the inheritance amen you need to get others into their [Music] inheritance so he's position us to overcome every enemy we face so it's not only for us the victory that we we are having now is not only for us but is to benefit the body of Christ it's also to strengthen the body of Christ amen Joshua 13 says every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses so you must possess your inheritence it's ours amen so when you plac in your position when you overcome when you realize that you should come to maturity and adoption in his hour then you must also now possess your inheritence you can't have inherence and not possess it amen when God has given you all this inheritance what benefit will it do what good it will do if you say I got this inheritance I got these things these are my regental blessing but you're not possessing it yes God has called me to be an invincible Army a super Church a super race but you're not possessing your inheritance they just going to be words but what we said earlier there must be a manifested words on the earth yes amen I see time is going Hebrews 11 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for for him that come to God must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek [Music] him so we must possess our spiritual inheritance amen amen then we must put on the whole armor of God because what we are placed for battle we going need to overcome so you must have your you can't have your armor you can't say I preach I was prayer my young days was a prayer 5 years ago I used to go in the peach and pray and so forth that that don't help you now the armor must be fresh amen the armor must be fresh now yes amen we don't want to use whole armor amen so you got to put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the vials of the devil the devil is Progressive yes sir amen the devil is Progressive he's not coming the old way tactics he's using he's changing his tactics all the time you know this devil is so good he can get you in such a way you won't even realize how he's getting you he get you by maybe you get someone close to you and say that person I got to feel for the no man this person is so close to me now I got to understand the way they're saying things let me go with them and they're going out of the message they're going out the way but I'll go with them you know you feel sympathy towards them you know a lot of people felt sympathy towards people and left the message to that's right I'm serious the devil knows how to play an emotion and he and he get you oh you feel so sorry for this person the situation should have happened then you see you're forgetting who you are you are going they're drowning you in their sorrows they're drowning you with their emotions about a situation about they kind because they are so Carly minded and then you forgetting now your position that you a person can speak to a situation that you sp can take that word and speak you see what I'm saying you joined the wrong people you joined the wrong company yeah so you got to put on your own love of God and able to stand the vs of the devil because what the armor of God represents it represents the entire nature of Christ amen and we are partakers of his divine nature so it must be we must stand firm in the truth of God's word amen so what I'm saying brothers and sisters our Victory to overcome the enemy he's not achieved Our Own Strength he's not achieved our by own Merit but by knowing our position in Christ we are chosen in this hour by predestination amen we adopted after coming to tutors after we are trained and after we are equipped then we come to adoption to overcome amen thank you Lord when we walk in our god-given Authority thank you Lord then we can defeat the enemy at every turn so tonight I ask you are we positioned and ready for the battle let us stand in our god-given Authority and Trust in his divine power to bring us to Victory amen God bless you amen [Applause] amen I don't know why I went on those lines uh but today I was just rejoicing it work adri knows why because the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordained of the Lord amen amen so one thing happened after the other and I was just rejoicing and I was just speaking to another brother and telling the things that happening the thing that we are speaking of the brother was amazed you should have seen the bubble on his face and I'm just talking about the things that that we are preaching in church the thing that some people might just think you know the people don't people don't even come and listen to this thing but people this brother was just rejoicing praise the Lord he was so excited to hear about the things of God so these are things are not ordinary things you're not hearing ordinary things God is equipping you for a reason that he needs a people to be in such a position to overcome the enemy in his hour not just for your benefit but for the benefit of the body of Christ so the victory can be appreciated by the body of Christ and you do that in love anything you do in God God for the things of God you do it in love yes amen amen God richly blessed you could I have come
