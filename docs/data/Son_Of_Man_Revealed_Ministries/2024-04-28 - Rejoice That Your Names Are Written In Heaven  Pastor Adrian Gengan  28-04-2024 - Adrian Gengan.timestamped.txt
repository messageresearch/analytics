[3:13] amen so you can be blessed with that

[3:17] Luke 10:1
[3:19] 17
[3:23] amen Luke chap 10:1 17
[3:35] so Jesus had sent the disciples away on
[3:37] a great missionary
[3:39] trip and he equipped them with
[3:43] power and now they coming back and the 7
[3:48] returned again with
[3:50] Joy saying Lord even the devils are
[3:53] subject unto us through thy
[3:56] name and he said unto them I beheld
[3:59] Satan as lightning fall from Heaven
[4:02] behold I give unto you power to tread
[4:04] upon serpents and scorpions and over all
[4:07] the power of the enemy and nothing shall
[4:09] by any means hurt
[4:12] you not withstanding in this Rejoice not
[4:16] that the spirits are subject unto you
[4:20] but rather Rejoice because your names
[4:22] are written in heaven amen but rather
[4:26] Rejoice because your names are written
[4:29] in heaven amen amen St John
[4:33] 6:37 amen John 6:37
[4:42] says praise the Lord all that the father
[4:45] giveth me shall come to
[4:48] me and him that cometh to me I will in
[4:52] no wise cast out amen praise the Lord
[4:55] one more scripture in Philippians CH 4:4
[5:02] Philippians 4:4 says rejoice in the lord
[5:05] always and again I say
[5:08] rejoice amen hallelujah rejoice in the
[5:12] lord always and again I say rejoice for
[5:15] title this morning amen I want to speak
[5:18] on rejoice that your names are written
[5:21] in heaven amen amen Rejoice that your
[5:24] names are written in heaven you may be
[5:25] seated amen hallelujah amen
[5:33] there's many things in this life to
[5:34] Rejoice about amen we can achieve
[5:38] material things in this life we can
[5:40] achieve amen things in our
[5:43] careers in our schooling
[5:46] life academic life whatever we set our
[5:50] mind to Sporting Life and we can really
[5:53] Rejoice around those things amen you
[5:56] find people that get behind a particular
[5:58] team and they go Friendzy and they
[6:00] Rejoice around that amen it's what makes
[6:03] people
[6:04] happy
[6:06] amen so what are you rejoicing about
[6:10] amen we that are called out under the
[6:13] seventh Angel's message under Malachi
[6:15] chapter 4 amen under Revelation 10 what
[6:20] are what are what is the point of our
[6:22] rejoicing what is the source of our
[6:24] rejoicing amen the reassuring words of
[6:27] our Jesus is that it's not left to ch
[6:30] yes
[6:31] Amah now there people in the world today
[6:34] you can go to most churches and ask them
[6:37] is your name written in the book of life
[6:40] and they may I have a
[6:42] doubt amen they may not be
[6:46] sure but if we read the scripture
[6:49] carefully the Lord Jesus now if you find
[6:52] there we know that the 70 turned and
[6:54] walked away but the prophet tells us
[6:57] with the 70 was the 12 yes right because
[7:01] if you put that scripture back up Luke
[7:04] 1720 amen you'll see when Jesus is
[7:06] saying not withstanding in this Rejoice
[7:09] that the spirits are subject unto you
[7:11] but rather Rejoice because your names
[7:13] are written in heaven now what was Jesus
[7:15] telling them don't Rejoice because you
[7:18] have power to remove illegal
[7:22] squatters demon powers that are there
[7:25] illegally yes amen amen I have given you
[7:28] authority over these things
[7:30] and we find people build their
[7:31] Ministries around how they can cast out
[7:34] Devils amen about praying for the sick
[7:37] they build the entire Ministry and
[7:39] reputation just because demon powers
[7:41] illegal occupants are cast
[7:46] out and the entire life goes by that
[7:48] reputation that this man is able to cast
[7:51] out Devils this man when he prays for
[7:53] the sick the sick are healed but Jesus
[7:56] is saying don't rejoice in those things
[7:59] don't build your ministry around those
[8:01] things amen he's telling them rather
[8:03] Rejoice be happy be glad because your
[8:07] names are written in heaven
[8:11] am and you go to the next verse you'll
[8:13] see the Lord telling the disciples now
[8:15] amen praise the Lord amen
[8:19] amen then he turns to the disciples and
[8:22] he's telling them that only their eyes
[8:25] are open to these things he said blessed
[8:27] are your eyes
[8:30] amen amen it's not for
[8:33] everybody amen hallelujah amen in the
[8:36] next verse brother
[8:38] Hallelujah he turns to his disciples and
[8:41] he tells them don't rejoice in these
[8:45] things but he says to
[8:49] you to you it is given to understand the
[8:52] mysteries of these things amen praise
[8:54] the Lord hallelujah have you got the
[8:57] verse amen Jesus rejoice voice in his
[9:00] spirit and he said I thank the father
[9:02] Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has
[9:04] hid these things from the wise and
[9:05] prudent and reveal them unto babes even
[9:09] so father for it seemed good in thy
[9:11] sight next verse
[9:13] amen all things are delivered to me of
[9:16] my father and no man knoweth who the son
[9:18] is but the father and who the father is
[9:21] but the son and to whom the son will
[9:24] reveal himself amen amen hallelujah amen
[9:28] so we see the takes a particular type of
[9:30] rejoicing and your life will never be
[9:32] the same again if you only realize that
[9:35] your name is recorded in heaven and that
[9:37] you were predestinated from before the
[9:39] foundation of the world amen amen people
[9:43] don't want to live up to the
[9:44] acknowledgement that they were for
[9:46] ordained for this hour amen
[9:48] predestinated for this hour that your
[9:50] name was put on the book and you have an
[9:53] obligation to live up to amen you must
[9:56] live up to the standard of it Hallelujah
[9:59] people are getting so caught up in just
[10:01] living an ordinary life on the earth
[10:04] amen and don't want to take pay
[10:06] attention to God's word and what he's
[10:08] calling us
[10:09] for amen God wrote your name now how is
[10:13] it possible for us to know can we say
[10:15] with certainty that our names are
[10:17] written in
[10:19] heaven we know that when the title deed
[10:22] was taken when Adam lost it in the
[10:24] Garden of Eden Adam had no
[10:27] intercessor there was nobody to plead
[10:29] his
[10:30] case Adam was left the Judgment Bars
[10:33] were set and Adam had to face the king
[10:37] Adam had to face
[10:38] God Adam had no intercessor to plead on
[10:43] his
[10:43] behalf because there was no blood shed
[10:46] yet amen amen yes so God took a lamb as
[10:51] a as a symbol and a type and he slew the
[10:55] lamb amen and his wrath was appeased and
[10:58] he took the skin of the lamb and he
[11:00] wrapped Adam and
[11:02] Eve so we find here amen that in the
[11:05] Book of Life we know that the the Bible
[11:08] speaks about the book of life and the
[11:10] prophet says it's not two books even
[11:12] though he says sometimes you can call it
[11:14] two books amen he says there is your two
[11:17] books one of them is the Lamb's Book of
[11:18] Life your name is on there predestinated
[11:21] on there amen you can't take away
[11:25] nothing it was forain to be there but
[11:27] the regular Book of Life can be taken
[11:30] off at any
[11:31] time you don't repent it's off anyhow
[11:35] cuz you're you're going to stand
[11:38] judgment now in no other age could you
[11:41] see your name in the
[11:46] book I'm trying to show you what Jesus
[11:48] was telling
[11:49] them that they couldn't really see
[11:52] it Jesus is telling them Rejoice that
[11:55] your name is written in heaven amen but
[11:57] where was the book
[11:59] the book was in the hand of the original
[12:01] owner in heaven if the 12 disciples
[12:05] wanted to see the name in the book there
[12:08] was no book for them to look upon but
[12:11] the Lord Jesus is telling them
[12:13] Rejoice that your name is written in
[12:15] heaven amen amen and all they had was
[12:18] Jesus word to tell them that you are
[12:20] called of my father my father has chosen
[12:23] you and to believe the words of Jesus
[12:25] that the name was in the book amen amen
[12:29] amen hallelujah in no other age could
[12:32] people see the name in the book but now
[12:34] that the Seven Seals are open amen now
[12:37] that the Lamb's Book of the the the
[12:39] section of the Lamb's Book of Life is
[12:42] brought into view amen and brought down
[12:45] to the Earth amen the ones whose names
[12:48] are in the book can now recognize
[12:50] themselves amen hallelujah praise the
[12:54] Lord amen given to ones those that names
[12:58] are in the book
[13:00] now for us in the message it seems that
[13:02] we have found some comfort in thinking
[13:04] just because we have accepted the
[13:06] message everything is fine God
[13:07] predestinated us we can't rejoice in our
[13:12] Salvation amen people find it hard to
[13:14] rejoice in their salvation you know
[13:17] there are billions of people in the
[13:19] world today and their names are not
[13:20] written in the Lamb's Book of Life but
[13:23] your name and my name is written in the
[13:25] Lamb's Book of Life God T of you amen
[13:28] God predestinated you this ought to
[13:30] bring rejoicing to our hearts this ought
[13:33] to bring joy to our hearts knowing that

[13:37] unto life

[13:42] be such a rejoicing amen there ought to
[13:45] be such a Hallelujah there ought to be
[13:47] such a praise in the house of God just

[24:18] do it his flesh had failed him
[24:21] Hallelujah he had become a mere man and
[24:24] death would take his
[24:25] life the moment man sinned God created a
[24:29] dimension in
[24:31] heaven amen hallelujah
[24:35] Paradise because man was never meant to
[24:37] die Hallelujah when man died he
[24:40] separated from his
[24:44] theophany he theophany went to this
[24:48] Dimension and he was left as a human on
[24:50] the earth left as a mortal man to
[24:54] die amen praise the Lord
[24:58] but God Amen it says the prophet says
[25:02] now that he was looking for a man God
[25:05] was looking for a
[25:06] man amen we find
[25:11] here he tried to find it in Moses he
[25:15] tried to find it in the prophets he
[25:17] tried to find it amen to all the
[25:19] prophets of the Old Testament but there
[25:22] was nobody worthy to take on the sin of
[25:25] man amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[25:30] amen Joseph the perfect type of our Lord
[25:33] Jesus Christ was still flawed
[25:36] yes
[25:38] Hallelujah you find there even Joseph
[25:41] right there in the lowest of the prison
[25:42] house was typing our Lord Jesus
[25:45] Christ amen Jesus died with two thieves
[25:49] one on either side Here Comes The Butler

[26:27] the blood ascends
[26:29] up amen because the blood is in

[26:35] speaks the blood had to go up to the
[26:38] king to speak and make intercession

[26:43] Lord so Joseph was a perfect type of the
[26:46] Lord Jesus Christ amen and it was the
[26:49] blood the one that was holding the cup

[27:19] caused Adam to fall amen God continued
[27:21] in his creation trying to find one man
[27:24] who would live by every word his first
[27:26] man failed and this man would live his

[27:37] tried every prophet and he knew amen
[27:40] that none of them would fit Redeemer
[27:43] none of them would fit was fit to give
[27:44] their lives so God created a body for
[27:47] himself the word was made flesh and it
[27:50] came and dwelt amongst us amen and that
[27:53] body of Amen Tabernacle God himself all
[27:56] that was in God heting to Christ amen
[27:59] and when Jesus Christ shed his blood on

[28:10] Man's sin beginning from Adam to the
[28:13] last man on the earth pay the price for
[28:16] our Redemption there's no sin too great
[28:18] that the blood can't cover don't let

[28:36] people they come to Christ they accept
[28:38] amen Christ they accept the blood but
[28:41] then they still want to go and crucify
[28:43] themselves over things they've done in

[59:39] Jesus spoke about not up one day down
[59:42] one day amen not going amen by your
[59:45] feelings but going amen that your name
[59:47] is written in heaven I'm rejoicing night
[59:49] and day as I walk this narrow way for
[59:52] the comforter abides with me I know who
[59:54] I am as a son of God
[59:56] what's your expectation in this
[59:58] life what is your expectation in this
[1:00:00] life what are you attaining to what do
[1:00:03] you want for your life I'm not talking

[1:00:07] talking about spiritual you where do you
[1:00:09] see yourself in 5 years if there's a 5
[1:00:12] years where do you see
[1:00:14] yourself how spiritually strong do you

[1:00:31] bring me into alignment with your
[1:00:33] thoughts and your plans for my
[1:00:35] life hallelujah praise the Lord praise
[1:00:38] the
[1:00:40] Lord God is only poent he's only present
[1:00:43] no man can come to Jesus except he calls
[1:00:45] him amen praise the
[1:00:52] Lord just want to find a place to close
[1:00:54] you now amen
[1:00:56] now you want to
[1:00:58] Rejoice praise the
[1:01:04] Lord so if we go to question and answers
[1:01:07] on the
[1:01:11] seals 114 there you'll see on that notes
[1:01:14] amen
[1:01:16] 114 they asked the prophet a question is
[1:01:19] it true that every born Jew every Jew
[1:01:22] born since Christ that came into the
[1:01:25] world is to be saved
[1:01:27] the prophet says nothing will be saved
[1:01:29] only those names were put in the Lamb's
[1:01:31] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:01:33] the
[1:01:34] world now the prophet is very strong in
[1:01:36] his teaching because the Baptist believe
[1:01:38] the day you accepted the Lord Jesus
[1:01:40] Christ that's the day your name is
[1:01:41] written in the
[1:01:43] book so the prophet is correcting that
[1:01:45] error and he's telling them the word
[1:01:47] Sayers your name was put there from
[1:01:48] before the foundation of the
[1:01:52] world now this is the part I want to get
[1:01:55] to the the book holds that
[1:01:58] mystery and the book is only unfolding
[1:02:01] it
[1:02:04] now not each one's name watch this is
[1:02:07] the point I was telling you earlier the
[1:02:09] book is not calling out your name you're
[1:02:12] not going to
[1:02:13] hear
[1:02:16] jayen you're not going to hear
[1:02:21] Caleb what are you going to
[1:02:23] hear but what the mystery of the book
[1:02:27] is while it's calling those names you
[1:02:31] fully understand that now so what is he
[1:02:33] saying is when the mystery of God is
[1:02:36] being revealed when you are hearing the
[1:02:38] mysteries of God your name is being
[1:02:40] called out your name is being called out
[1:02:44] now you know why you can respond to the
[1:02:45] word brother brandom's teachings and the
[1:02:48] denominations can't because behind the
[1:02:51] mystery there's a call of your name
[1:02:53] behind the mystery there's a call of
[1:02:54] your name amen behind the mystery of
[1:02:57] serpent seed you can hear your name
[1:02:58] being called behind the mystery of
[1:03:03] Hallelujah Hallelujah because you can't
[1:03:05] tell me you supernaturally heard your
[1:03:06] name being called but you came up
[1:03:08] because of the mysteries of God what was
[1:03:11] it the attributes of God were being
[1:03:13] revealed in the back part of
[1:03:16] it thank you Lord on the front of it you
[1:03:19] were hearing amen the mysteries of God
[1:03:21] all the
[1:03:23] titles but on the back side of each you
[1:03:25] were hearing the names being called
[1:03:28] hallelujah amen hallelujah see not each
[1:03:32] one's name but what the mystery of the
[1:03:34] book is while it's calling those
[1:03:37] names so you see when they are rejecting
[1:03:39] the Mysteries they are rejecting their
[1:03:41] call right amen and what happens brother
[1:03:44] brandom says yes there's a book of life
[1:03:46] he says there's only one book and he
[1:03:48] transitions into the lamb
[1:03:51] section right he says but there is some
[1:03:55] that got
[1:03:56] but there's some that got their name
[1:03:58] written on the Lamb's Book of Life when
[1:04:00] them seals are thrown open there they
[1:04:02] see the name there we got that second
[1:04:06] seal but there some that's got their
[1:04:09] names written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:04:11] and when them seals are thrown open they
[1:04:14] see their name
[1:04:17] there
[1:04:19] Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit speaks to
[1:04:21] them they come you can't keep them away
[1:04:25] amen no one can no one they're coming
[1:04:28] anyhow because you're leading them like
[1:04:31] like you did those little birds and the
[1:04:33] sheep and the cattle Thou Art God some
[1:04:36] Instinct Instinct that them animals have
[1:04:39] that they know that they must get away
[1:04:40] now watch what brother BR is trying to
[1:04:42] do here he's trying to show you that
[1:04:44] animals have an instinct but you have a
[1:04:46] theopen
[1:04:47] body
[1:04:51] Hallelujah animals have an instinct but
[1:04:53] you have a theopen body you are hearing
[1:04:56] from your theophany amen
[1:05:00] hallelujah
[1:05:03] amen that's one quote and the next one
[1:05:05] he says I'm trusting I'm I'm I'm one of
[1:05:08] those that's going to find my name
[1:05:09] tonight behind that seal Yonder that was
[1:05:12] put on there from the foundation of the
[1:05:14] world something struck my heart and I'm
[1:05:15] standing Lord is it me are you calling I
[1:05:18] want you to reveal you see brother raes
[1:05:20] was sharing with me he jumped into a
[1:05:24] comi some some probably invited him they
[1:05:27] were going for a prayer meeting with
[1:05:29] rames and he jumped into a Combi and he
[1:05:31] was listening to their conversation and
[1:05:34] they were speaking about Footprints in
[1:05:35] the Sand of time and he said you know
[1:05:37] what I read that
[1:05:39] somewhere
[1:05:40] amen something connected years earlier
[1:05:43] he had read was was it Prophet visit
[1:05:46] South
[1:05:48] Africa hey 1973 he read that
[1:05:52] book probably forgot about it the book
[1:05:57] but sitting in the combi he heard them
[1:05:59] speak something am and it took him back
[1:06:02] years to what he read what was it deep
[1:06:06] calling to the Deep wasn't in a
[1:06:08] preaching
[1:06:09] service you know normally if you're the
[1:06:11] first time person in a Combi you're not
[1:06:14] going to be talking much you're going to
[1:06:16] be listening to
[1:06:18] conversations amen praise the Lord
[1:06:22] amen their names were put in the Lamb's
[1:06:24] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:06:26] the world Amen so can you see your name
[1:06:29] in the book a good sign that your name
[1:06:32] is in the book is if you receive the
[1:06:33] message of the hour only the sons of God
[1:06:36] whose names are in the book can respond
[1:06:38] to the call of the message of the hour
[1:06:40] because the shout has come gather the
[1:06:42] names that are found in the book
[1:06:45] amen amen praise the Lord
[1:06:52] amen I want to show you four things
[1:06:54] quickly
[1:06:56] just read this four things quickly that
[1:06:57] you need to understanding about the book
[1:06:59] of life right brother Bram is going to
[1:07:01] detail this very quickly we'll try and
[1:07:03] go through it as quick as possible then
[1:07:05] we'll
[1:07:06] close right so he's saying first of all
[1:07:09] we all we know most assuredly that the
[1:07:12] purpose of God stands in election it was
[1:07:15] purposed in himself it was God's purpose
[1:07:17] to bring forth a people like unto
[1:07:19] himself that would be a word bride she
[1:07:22] was chosen before the foundation of the
[1:07:24] world in him she was forn and beloved
[1:07:27] before she was ever brought forth during
[1:07:29] the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed
[1:07:31] by his blood and can never come into
[1:07:33] condemnation this is you now whose names
[1:07:35] are in the Lamb's Book of Life amen you
[1:07:38] can never come into condemnation she can
[1:07:41] never be in judgment because sin cannot
[1:07:43] be imputed unto her right blessed is the
[1:07:46] man to whom the Lord will not impute sin
[1:07:49] but indeed she shall be with him in his
[1:07:51] throne of judgment judging the world
[1:07:53] even the angels her name each of her
[1:07:56] members was written in a section of the
[1:07:58] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:08:01] foundation of the world so that's one
[1:08:03] section how many of you identify with
[1:08:05] that section amen amen that's the ones
[1:08:08] whose names were written before the
[1:08:09] foundation of the world there's another
[1:08:11] class now he says secondly there's
[1:08:13] another class their names are also
[1:08:15] written in the also in the book of life
[1:08:18] and they will come up in the second
[1:08:19] Resurrection such are the foolish
[1:08:22] virgins and the righteous have spoken
[1:08:26] of in Matthew 25 in this class also are
[1:08:29] those who do not worship the Beast or
[1:08:31] become involved in the Antichrist system
[1:08:33] but die for their faith even though they
[1:08:35] are not in the bride not having been
[1:08:37] born again but they will come up in the
[1:08:39] second resurrection and go into eternal
[1:08:41] life Hallelujah that's the second part
[1:08:43] now in the
[1:08:45] book third part of the book these are
[1:08:47] the Borderland Christians that we saw in
[1:08:50] Israel coming out of Egypt these are the
[1:08:52] names in The Book of Life and their
[1:08:54] Works written in in the books these
[1:08:57] having failed to obey God and being void
[1:08:59] of the spirit so they don't have the
[1:09:01] Holy Spirit though even the signs and
[1:09:03] wonders were amongst
[1:09:06] them so you see these are your faith
[1:09:08] healers and all of these people
[1:09:10] right will will have their names removed
[1:09:13] from the
[1:09:16] book among this group will be the ones
[1:09:18] like Judas who who though entirely void
[1:09:22] of the spirit but are religious will
[1:09:24] have manifestation in their lives and
[1:09:26] though on the books were not the elected
[1:09:29] in him such also are balum with that
[1:09:31] group so here's the fourth part now
[1:09:34] fourth and finally are the ones whose
[1:09:36] names have never been or will ever be
[1:09:38] written on the
[1:09:40] books such are found in Revelation 138
[1:09:43] Revelation 178 all them that dwell upon
[1:09:46] the Earth shall worship Him whose names
[1:09:48] are not written in the Book of Life
[1:09:50] slain from before the foundation of the
[1:09:52] world he's quoting all the scriptures
[1:09:54] there amen
[1:10:00] you see none of these will be placed on
[1:10:02] the records of life I am not saying
[1:10:04] there's no record of them no doubt
[1:10:06] there's some kind of record of them but
[1:10:08] not in the records of Life the purpose
[1:10:11] of existence has been dealt with
[1:10:13] slightly in the rest of this book but we
[1:10:15] can add two more scriptures so he gives
[1:10:17] you two more scriptures there
[1:10:20] right some will be offended by what I
[1:10:23] have set forth because they fail to
[1:10:25] understand understand the sovereignity
[1:10:26] of God who sets forth that God is God
[1:10:29] because he is God one cannot defeat his
[1:10:31] counsels toward his will and purpose he
[1:10:34] is omnipotent ruling all Affairs and
[1:10:36] doing whatever he will with all his
[1:10:38] creation because all we created for his
[1:10:40] good
[1:10:42] pleasure so he details us now and he
[1:10:44] says thus if God so designed that there
[1:10:47] be those whose names are placed in a
[1:10:49] section of the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:10:51] cannot be erased for they are the names
[1:10:53] of his bride then we must accept them
[1:10:57] it also states that there are those
[1:10:58] whose names were placed in the record of
[1:10:59] the book of life but in the full
[1:11:01] knowledge of God they were to fall and
[1:11:03] have the names removed we must accept
[1:11:06] that and if those whose names were never
[1:11:11] placed upon the record of life we must
[1:11:13] also we must accept that also and if
[1:11:16] there are those who will enter into life
[1:11:19] eternal after the white Throne judgment
[1:11:21] solely on the grounds of being good and
[1:11:23] kind and just to the elect of God whom
[1:11:26] are his Brethren then we we we must
[1:11:29] accept that for who knowe the mind of
[1:11:31] the Lord that that he should instruct
[1:11:34] him rather let us be subject in faith to
[1:11:36] him who is our father and live amen now
[1:11:40] maybe in the course of the
[1:11:42] sermon you would have picked up if your
[1:11:45] name is in the book amen amen
[1:11:49] amen you would have picked up somewhere
[1:11:51] in that sermon if your name is in the
[1:11:53] book amen and if your name is in the
