Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, from the depths of our hearts, we say we owe it all to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When we fell, oh God, &gt;&gt; in the Garden of Eden, there was no way back. &gt;&gt; We had lost fellowship. &gt;&gt; We had lost relationship. &gt;&gt; There was no way back to you. &gt;&gt; But Father, you came running to express your attribute. [Music] &gt;&gt; And as a savior, you came and you slew the lamb. paid the price. It was a partial atonement for the shed blood of that innocent lamb. &gt;&gt; But how we thank you, Lord, 2,000 years, 4,000 years later, oh God, &gt;&gt; you will come on the cross. &gt;&gt; The perfect bloody bleeding lamb, &gt;&gt; bled for our sins. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are washed in the blood of Jesus. Oh, I am so glad that the blood, oh God, &gt;&gt; that I can have forgiveness of sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can have fellowship back with God &gt;&gt; and I can have my relationship back. &gt;&gt; I give you glory, Lord. I give you glory, give you praise, give you honor this morning. Oh God, &gt;&gt; we thank you for every soul that has come into the house of the Lord this morning. I pray Lord that you would speak to every heart and meet them at the point of their need. Oh God, each one has come, Lord, with a burning desire to meet with you, Lord, to come, Lord, into a union with you, Father. I pray, Lord, that even now, oh God, your great Holy Spirit will come and tabernacle you, son and daughter of God. Even as your word comes forth, I pray, Lord, you'll break the bread of life to our hungry souls. We thank you for the songs of Zion. We thank you, Lord, for the music. We thank you for the singing, oh God. We thank you for each item, oh God. We Lord, everything was done to give you glory, Lord. &gt;&gt; But come and be pleased, Lord, and share your word with us, Lord. Be with us even in the meeting. Let your angels move, oh God, all across this place. I'm praying even now, they will surround us, oh God. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; We ask your blessings in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we give God a good anchor of praise? &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. Amen. Amen. Amen. The angels bow before him. Heavens and earth adore him. What a mighty God &gt;&gt; we serve. Amen. So it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. I greet you all in the precious the holy name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. One of these days we are going to see him face to face. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what a beautiful picture that will be to see our Lord face to face. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So Amen. I also want to greet Amen. Pastor Denzel's mom is here with us again. I didn't get your name, sister. Amen. Caleb, sister Sarah, you need to tell me the name, find out the name of sister and tell me loudly. &gt;&gt; Sister Premier, let's welcome her this morning. Amen. You know, God can use women &gt;&gt; to raise up godly men to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's her part of the ministry &gt;&gt; to have raised a godly son &gt;&gt; who is now a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ. So the Lord reward you dear sister. Amen. We be blessed in his presence. Amen. Let's turn to our Bibles this morning. Amen. Don't forget, Amen. the combined service at 400 p.m. The Durban Girl Secondary School. Amen. Of pastor Moses Jova. It will be his final meeting. Amen. So come expecting a blessing. Amen. And you shall receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, the Christian life is all about expectation. &gt;&gt; You get what you expect. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'll turn to second Peter chapter 1 verse 11. This is the third part of our series. We were talking about a door being open to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we found the key to the door was revelation given to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everyone familiar with that? &gt;&gt; And then we found sometimes like last week's message now you can get into the kingdom but not have power. You can be the queen with no authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you need another ministry of attack to take you into the king's chamber. &gt;&gt; So it says in one uh second Peter 1:1, for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now when when Peter is writing this, it is prophecy. If we are standing here in 2025, we can say an entrance has been ministered unto us abundantly. &gt;&gt; There is no ministry coming after the rapture. &gt;&gt; So, we've got to agree that the ministry has already been that the entrance has already been ministered to us via an anti-profit. &gt;&gt; And where is this everlasting kingdom? You'll find it in Ephesians. It's heavenly places. So the ministry is designed to pull us out of the lenian age, &gt;&gt; out of the chicken yard &gt;&gt; and put us &gt;&gt; into the bride age. &gt;&gt; It's called the everlasting kingdom because it's the blending of time and eternity. &gt;&gt; You remember the angel put up his hand and he said, "Time shall be no more." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So where we are placed positionally right now is in a place where we are blending into eternity into heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Psalm 45 and verse4, mark this down. Make it your own if your scriptures you remember. For thou, oh Lord, will bless the righteous. With favor will thou compass him as with a shield. That word compass means to surround you. So he's saying the Lord's favor will surround us like a shield. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God's favor is surrounding us like a shield. &gt;&gt; Yes. Everywhere you go, you have favor. You turn to the left, favor surrounds you. You turn to the right, favor surrounds you. You go forward, favor surrounds you. You move backwards, favor surrounds you because it surrounds you like a shield. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Esther 5 and two. Praise the Lord. And it was so when king the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court. What a beautiful sight this must have been. &gt;&gt; The Bible records Esther as being the most beautiful woman &gt;&gt; in all the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So imagine the king beholding the most glorious bride in Revelation 19:7. The marriage of the lamb is come. His bride had made herself ready and she's clothed in fine linen. And so he's looking at you right now. And the king saw Esther standing in the court that she obtained favor. So favor is going to surround Esther like his shield. &gt;&gt; Now remember what favor is. It's grace. &gt;&gt; Grace is unmmerited favor. &gt;&gt; Nothing we have done. Oh, somebody can thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; So favor surrounds Esther. She finds favor in his sight. And the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. And Esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter to say, "The grace you the favor you're extending to me, I accept it. &gt;&gt; There's a part for you to play. &gt;&gt; Don't just stand there in the presence. Go and reach and touch the scepter, &gt;&gt; showing that you're receiving whatever the king is giving us." One more portion of scripture before we se it. Zechariah 4:7. This is prophecy also of an end time people and where we are currently. Who art thou oh great mountain before Zerubbabel? Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth a headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thereof with shoutings. &gt;&gt; The headstone is shouting. &gt;&gt; Somebody say the headstone is Christ. &gt;&gt; And what is he shouting? Unmmerited favor. &gt;&gt; He is shouting unmmerited favor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shouting grace. Grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A double portion. Grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may be seated. So I'm speaking this morning and an entrance has been ministered unlocking God's door of favor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In a normal love story, there's only one woman that can unlock the door to a man's heart. &gt;&gt; A man might meet many women along the way. Now, I'm talking about a straight man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A man who is committed to one woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about many women unlocking the door to your heart. And it's very important that the way you start is you either finish better and not worse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you read about Solomon, &gt;&gt; we are impressed that he asked God for wisdom. &gt;&gt; We are impressed that God blessed him. &gt;&gt; We're impressed that for thousand years there was peace. &gt;&gt; But how did Solomon end? &gt;&gt; The Bible says that Solomon's heart was turned away from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of the idols, &gt;&gt; so it's not tell your neighbor, it's not how you start, &gt;&gt; it's how you finish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in 1970, 1980s, you were praying in the beach. Good. It's how you end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the 80s and the '9s, and the 2000s, whenever you came across a message, you read the Bible, you were praying. &gt;&gt; What about now 2025? &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not going to attribute what you did in the past if you finished badly. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; So we're speaking on unlocking God's door. Favor and entrance has been ministered to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Now if we are not aware of the time and season that we are living in we are not going to be able to meet what is required of us for the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now the word favor means approval. If I give you my favor, you got my approval. You got my support. Amen. So God's favor is surrounding us like a shield. Now many of you, many of us probably don't even know that we haven't fallen because of God's favor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Every day we are coming under demonic attack, &gt;&gt; spiritual attack, &gt;&gt; physical attack, &gt;&gt; and we are not standing on our own strength. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to know, no human strength can stand this test of time. &gt;&gt; It's got to be God's unmmerited favor upon our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why you and I are standing. So get this idea and this notion that we are big people and we are proud people. No, it's because of the favor of God. &gt;&gt; It's because of the mercy of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't even walk without you holding my hand. &gt;&gt; The mountains too high. The valley is too wide. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it is God's favor surrounding us. We could have died in an accident, but God's favor was protecting us. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the Bible saying? The angel of the Lord and camp around them that fear him. &gt;&gt; Amen. We were trying to express to you that generally when you go camping, you have to take your tent. &gt;&gt; You have to take your necessary things to go and set up camp. But here the angel of the Lord is doing all the work because wherever you are moving, he is moving with you with his camp. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's setting up camp where you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's divine protection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know that every nation must protect its citizens? &gt;&gt; So when we come into the kingdom of God, it is no different. The kingdom of God has a highest standard. &gt;&gt; He takes care of our daily needs because in this kingdom, he doesn't leave us to fend for ourselves. But because we are the children of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. He takes care of our daily provision. Therefore, he said when you come into my kingdom and you seek my kingdom, don't even worry about food. &gt;&gt; Don't even worry about clothing because that is my basic necessity that I will take care of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will take care of your protection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will take care of your daily needs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if we you know sometimes there are grants unlocked to us &gt;&gt; and you don't go and apply for it and you're living under your privileges. For example, if you turn 60 and you're not earning a income, the government has a provision for you to get assessor grant. How many of you aware of that? &gt;&gt; If you're 60 and you didn't aware of it, now you're aware of it. There's a sassa grant. Amen. And they pay you that money every month. Now imagine you're sitting in your house, you turn 60, you got no work, and you're starving, you're going asking everyone for money, but you never applied for the grant. &gt;&gt; Whose fault is it? &gt;&gt; It's because of ignorance. &gt;&gt; You don't have the knowledge. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and how many of you know that in this time and season, you must have a concern for your own soul? &gt;&gt; Amen. You must seek out your own salvation with fear and trembling. &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, do you have a concern for your soul? &gt;&gt; Young people, do you have a concern for your soul? &gt;&gt; Do you know where you're going to go when you die? &gt;&gt; Amen. And don't leave it to chance. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Make your calling and your election show. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Know for a certainty that if I had to breathe my last right now, I will be in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't leave it to chance. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Don't be like that rich young ruler &gt;&gt; who turned away from Jesus. You say, "I would never turn away from Jesus." But then you turn away and walk away from this preacher. &gt;&gt; Do you know you are turning and walking away from Jesus? &gt;&gt; When you tell me, "I'll hear you tomorrow," you are telling Jesus, "I'll hear you tomorrow." &gt;&gt; Some of you tell me you will never lie to Jesus, but you lie to me. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you lie to your brothers and your sisters. &gt;&gt; Oh, but now it's different. &gt;&gt; We forget that we are living in apostolic times again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where somebody lied to Peter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody lied to Peter and Peter as why did you lie to the &gt;&gt; ghost? &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; People lie easily. People lie like what knife throw a butter. &gt;&gt; People give the lamest excuse. I I'll just quote the prophet the way he says it. You can let the chips fall where it must. The prophet says not to come to church on a Sunday is a &gt;&gt; s i &gt;&gt; sin. Why is it the same word that e was caught in? same word. &gt;&gt; So which means you're equally as guilty as Eve, but you keep picking on Eve. &gt;&gt; S I N. &gt;&gt; And in this time and season, I want to tell you, not only on a Sunday, &gt;&gt; if you're supposed to be in church, it's your duty. The prophet says, if the doors of the church are open, it is your duty. &gt;&gt; Amen. to be found in fellowship with believers of like precious faith. &gt;&gt; That's the prophet. &gt;&gt; Now, we can't claim to be saying we believe a prophet. We believe a prophet only in word. &gt;&gt; We're going to find ourselves like I think it's Isaiah 4 if you put it there. It could be Isaiah 4. If it's not, I'll maybe try seven. Amen. Yeah. This is what people want. In that day, seven women shall take hold of one man. They want the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; They want to be associated with the name of Jesus. Seven men, seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, "We will eat our own bread. Wear our own apparel and only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach." &gt;&gt; Amen. So they want the name of Jesus which is a blas amen names of blasphemy. They got the name of Jesus on their churches but they don't want his word. &gt;&gt; So they are saying the shoes on my feet I bought it. &gt;&gt; The car I'm driving I bought it. &gt;&gt; Hey they're independent women. &gt;&gt; Do you know something? You can't be an independent woman in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; Go read the opening chapter of Esther and see what happened to independent woman. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Vasti. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Vasti was an independent woman. &gt;&gt; She was having she was in the kingdom having the king's name but having private functions. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The king calls. She is so disobedient. She doesn't even respond to the king's word. &gt;&gt; People want the name of Jesus. They want to say we go to a message church. They want to say we believe in time prophet. They want to say I believe Jesus, but then they deny the word. Jesus said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, people don't want to be baptized in his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People want to believe in a trinity of gods. &gt;&gt; When when even Israel had the revelation here, oh Israel, &gt;&gt; the Lord thy God is one Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this scripture is becoming more of a reality and people are looking for that time for the fulfillment of the scripture physically. But they don't know it's a spiritual application. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual application. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So when now remember what Jesus said, seek first the kingdom and his righteousness, all these things shall be added. Here they are saying we don't even want the provisions within the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Because our denomination is so great, so powerful, we bring in millions, &gt;&gt; thousands. we are able to take care of ourselves. Only give us your name so we can operate under your name &gt;&gt; and collect the funds every week. &gt;&gt; That's what they're doing. They're operating under the name of Jesus Christ to collect funding. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How many of you are seeing that? &gt;&gt; That's right. They are using the name of Jesus Christ to collect funds, charitable organizations. Amen. So what we have learned like we I'm just going to summarize this very quickly. Jesus is the door, right? John 10:7. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; John 10:7. Jesus is the door. Jesus said, "I am the door." And then we found Revelation 10:7 is the key to unlock the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because you can't understand who Jesus is, who Christ is. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. And you need Revelation 10:7 to unlock John 10:7. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been through that message two weeks ago. &gt;&gt; So, we've got to have the key of Revelation to unlock Jesus. You need a prophet. You need a pastor. You need a minister to minister this entrance into you to unlock this door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We found that every kingdom must have a queen. And we have been selected as the royal &gt;&gt; queen of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As the most beautiful queen, &gt;&gt; but I'm saying that the Lord is taking us now from just queen &gt;&gt; and he's establishing us as super queen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As a queen without authority and now placing us as a queen with authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do we know? Character building. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's been building up our character, taking us through stages in his word to show us, I need to develop your character in order for you to be able to handle the authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, people have responded to the prophet's message. We believe the message. Amen. We believe this message. How many of you have responded to the prophet's message? Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many of you here because of your mother? How many of you here because of your father? &gt;&gt; How many of you here because of your brother, your sister or friend? &gt;&gt; We ought to be here because of our own personal relationship with the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Do you know there can be no context? People like context. Time come for rapture, there will be no context. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The rich young ruler didn't have a context. He saw Abraham, but he realized this contact to Abraham would not work. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You don't make the rapture finished. &gt;&gt; There's a word we use. It's called kaput. You know the word kaput. &gt;&gt; It's finished. &gt;&gt; Finish and cloud. &gt;&gt; How many of you know that word? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So when the mystery of God is revealed, we are finding that part of the mystery of God being revealed is a door to marriage was open to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember we showed you brother Brandham's commission was to find a bride like Eliza found a bride. &gt;&gt; So door to marriage was open to us. So this entrance being ministered to us is the door to marriage. And the only way the door can be opened is after denominational ages have run out. &gt;&gt; You see, we got too many people that have accepted the message &gt;&gt; of the hour, accepted the end time prophet, but are stuck in &gt;&gt; Leia. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the prophet says at the top at the seventh step, &gt;&gt; there's somebody there to meet you, a messenger &gt;&gt; to lead you to the king's chamber. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; the king's chamber is not in the seven church age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The king's chamber is in the headstone. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Nobody saying amen. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, don't sleep. &gt;&gt; Sleeping must endure for the night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must sleep at home. You can't come in the church and sleep. Amen. Today I'm being nice. I'm telling you nicely. Next week I will say, "Brother way, wake up." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why? We only here and and you can't accuse me of being a long preacher. &gt;&gt; So there's no reason why you should be asleep. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I try and condense a message so you get as much message content as possible &gt;&gt; in the short period of time. But I need you to retain it in your knowledge and I need you to be awake. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Next time if I see you sleepy I'm going to say I five your neighbor. Then you know why. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we're finding Amen. that the door to marriage is open. And how did we become aware that the door to marriage is open? It was under the seventh seal. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a mystery. &gt;&gt; The prophet would say it like Romeo coming for Juliet, &gt;&gt; like a thief coming in the night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a mystery under the seventh seal that he takes a bride. &gt;&gt; He marries her &gt;&gt; and he puts his seed word in her. &gt;&gt; Why? His end goal is for restoration of relationship which is sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember it's a very simple story. What was lost must be restored. &gt;&gt; Sunship was lost. So what must be restored? &gt;&gt; Sunship. &gt;&gt; And God is not somebody who won't walk in order. In order for him to get a son, he needs a wife. &gt;&gt; So he takes us collectively as a wife. &gt;&gt; And he reproduces his life in us to bring us back to sunship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the opening of the door, like we're saying, has only happened now &gt;&gt; after denominational ages have run out. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The opening of the door to marriage wasn't opened in the time of Luther. &gt;&gt; In the time of Wesley, &gt;&gt; in the time of restoration of the gifts, &gt;&gt; I'll show you even had gifts because a guy gives her gifts to go before the king. &gt;&gt; So she had restoration of gifts, &gt;&gt; but she didn't have the give of the gifts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you see it? &gt;&gt; There's a separation line. &gt;&gt; You can't enter into the presence of the king. &gt;&gt; There isn't. So, you can come so close to the message. You can come so close to receiving the prophetic word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But you got no relationship with the king. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, in the book of Esther, we seeing she's called, she's chosen for marriage, but she's a queen without power under Agi. But an entrance was ministered unto her via a tech and she had a choice to make. Now listen, this is very important because I can't come and force you into the presence the shakina glory of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's not the ministry of &gt;&gt; Ach. &gt;&gt; As much as we would like to pull you and push you into the presence, it's only a ministry to tell you that you can go in &gt;&gt; that that's your ought to be conditioned. &gt;&gt; But Esther herself had to make up her own mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll find there she finally sends word if you want to read it in Esther chapter 4. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay, let's read verse 11. I want to get this point in as well. All the king's servants and people of the king's province do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner court. You see we're talking about three courts here. Whoever comes into the holiest of holies. Whoever comes into the shik of glory, there is one law of his is to be put to death except such as to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter &gt;&gt; that he may live. But I have not been called to come in unto the king these 30 days. 30 days. She didn't see the king. Now pay attention to that because the message is not to the public. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Under the seventh seal, the message is not to the public. &gt;&gt; So to the public, you are not allowed to come into the king's chamber. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But only one who bears his name &gt;&gt; has the right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me put it this way. Moriah was not contacting any other individual to go and speak to the king. &gt;&gt; There is only one woman designed &gt;&gt; to go and speak to the king. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I mean, I was speaking to some brothers here and they was rereading the book of Esther and they were telling me they're unlocking nuggets in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they can see our story in there. &gt;&gt; Yes. Remember there's only two books named after woman in the Bible. &gt;&gt; One is Ruth which speaks about redemption. &gt;&gt; And the other is Esther who speaks about being a queen. &gt;&gt; So from redemption to queen and that's how we end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Redeemed at the cross &gt;&gt; standing here as the queen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Having I'm saying this somebody please get me. Having already overcome &gt;&gt; Leosia. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. I already overcame Lisia. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But tomorrow I may fall. I don't care about tomorrow. I'm telling you, I already overcame it here. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a finished work. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ has made provision for me because I'm not living on my own strength. I'm living on what his word said for me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He says, I will present you &gt;&gt; without spot. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, come on. Right now, you may be sitting here with spots, but the Lord Jesus Christ is saying, "I will present you without spots, &gt;&gt; without wrinkle." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ sees you as perfect. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Stop depending upon our own human strength &gt;&gt; upon even upon our own human emotion. Oh, I don't feel. Amen. You need to squash your feelings. &gt;&gt; You need to operate by the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Esther had a choice to make. Now watch, she makes her own mind up here. Now watch in Esther chapter Amen 4:1 16. Now after speaks to her, the words of Modiah, listen, I'm I'm bringing this because it's up to you. Now go gather all the Jews that are present in Shusham and fast you for me. She's now making this commitment. And neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I also and my maidens will fast likewise. So will I go into in unto the king which is not according to the law. And if I perish, I perish. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now watch Modiah. He's not alarmed &gt;&gt; that this woman might die. So Mori went his way and did according to all that Esther had commanded him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You as Esther must consecrate your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're missing this part of before she appears before the king. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She consecrates her life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me tell you the access to divine power is a life of consecration. &gt;&gt; The access to the divine power must be accompanied by consecration. &gt;&gt; If you want to operate in the greater things that Jesus did, you must match Jesus surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, people are not here now, but people don't like this kind of preaching. It's too close to home. &gt;&gt; Why don't tell us about how we are saved? &gt;&gt; I'm asking about your prayer life. &gt;&gt; Tell me how Jesus loves me. Do you pray? &gt;&gt; Tell me about how we are the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ. Do you read your Bible? &gt;&gt; Why you keep changing the topic? &gt;&gt; Amen. We claim to be Christians without Christ. &gt;&gt; You see, I'm giving you a break this week. Every Christian ought to carry his &gt;&gt; and come to church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come to church. Carry your what? &gt;&gt; Bible. And come to church. This is not your Bible. &gt;&gt; What is this? &gt;&gt; I'm going to take all we're going to go on excursion. We're all going to go on excursion. We're going to go to the court, brother Joshua. &gt;&gt; They allow you this in court. &gt;&gt; They don't. &gt;&gt; You go to school, they allow this in school. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; they don't. But how come in the higher kingdom? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The greatest kingdom, &gt;&gt; we treat God anyhow. &gt;&gt; If you got money to buy takeaway, you got money to buy yourself a Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ask your neighbor, "Where's your Bible? &gt;&gt; Where's your Bible?" You can buy every other thing. &gt;&gt; Where's the most important thing? &gt;&gt; Abu, preach us the greatest. I'm giving you the greatest thing here. &gt;&gt; I want you to have the greatest thing in your hand. How many of you can't afford a Bible? You putting your hand up? Who can't afford a Bible? with the Josh. You got a Bible. I saw you got a Bible at home or you got it there, right? &gt;&gt; Bible first. &gt;&gt; How many of you will comment to bring your Bible to church? &gt;&gt; Now, don't only bring it to church. Read it before you come to church. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, this is not only I'd rather be honest, it's not only for the congregation. It's for musicians as well. &gt;&gt; Musicians must read their Bible. And all our musicians said &gt;&gt; so all musicians will bring their &gt;&gt; because when when we are reading the scripture now you will take your Bible and you will make notes mark this is the scripture we read. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey I can sense the atmosphere getting sour here. People don't like this kind of preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. But today we are at your doorstep. &gt;&gt; Amen. We first got going to unlock your door &gt;&gt; and see what kind of skeletons are behind your door. &gt;&gt; Why can't we be people of integrity? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why can't we be upright people? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Righteous people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christians that are God is not ashamed of. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God is proud to say that is my son and daughter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hey, we're not here playing church. &gt;&gt; We are here getting ready for a rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; We here to get ourselves ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, people will go to great lengths. &gt;&gt; They can't come to church, but we let them get sick. They can get to hospital. &gt;&gt; They'll make their way to get to the clinic. &gt;&gt; Even if they have to go there 4:00 in the morning, &gt;&gt; because they are so confident an earthly doctor can help them. &gt;&gt; But the prophet says the church, the body of Christ is the sickest body. And this is a hospital. &gt;&gt; But we come here 10. The doctor available. &gt;&gt; We we laughing now, but check what time you came to church &gt;&gt; today. And nobody's excluded. Not even me. &gt;&gt; Check what time you came. In fact, the only person that could have come late is me. How come you start work at 8:00 you can make it on time by 10:00 you can't make it. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to everyone. &gt;&gt; How come we don't prioritize church? How come we are late for church? And we're wondering why the atmosphere is like this. People can't sing. People can't sing. They were watching movies last night. They were having brides. They were having lots of things &gt;&gt; and were not preparing themselves to come to church to hear from heaven. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're coming here up as it. I'll be honest. We're coming here uphazard. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; We are not coming here realizing that this is the entrance to the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm coming early. My quiet time. Now your quiet time is even if your wife shouted at you in the car, you can now your spirit because now you're standing next to in the church. You finish shouting at you. Now you're going to worship. So you need to read your Bible. You need to pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to get your spirit right. We need to get rid of all that demons. &gt;&gt; Yes. Lord met Rebecca at the well. He went half an hour before Eliza. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the angel of the Lord is here already. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord is here already. Are you coming at 10? Some of us know we got responsibilities in the church, but we will not even make an effort. I was hearing one preacher, Brother Steven Shemble. He says, "If your parents are late, get in your own car and get to church." Or even tell them, you can tell them other things, but you can't tell them, "Mom and dad, why are we going late to church?" &gt;&gt; I don't know. It sounds like sourdough bread today. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know, that's a good bread. &gt;&gt; Sourdough bread is very good &gt;&gt; for your gut. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they say you your healing is in your gut. &gt;&gt; So tell your neighbor today is sour bread. &gt;&gt; We're cleaning our guts. &gt;&gt; It's okay if we don't get through the sermon. &gt;&gt; It's not so much about his sermon. &gt;&gt; It's about getting ourselves right with God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what does Eston need to do? The king is the head. He's the headstone. &gt;&gt; She needs to get to the headstone. And as she nears him, she's coming into his image. That's a quote. As she nears him, &gt;&gt; she'll be so much like him. How? Through prayer. &gt;&gt; Through consecration. &gt;&gt; She'll be so much like him that heaven won't even know whether it's Jesus praying or you praying. &gt;&gt; That's a direct quote, too. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many of you know that in a natural birth there's a timeline given? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You only got 9 months now. You can't love being pregnant more than bringing forth that child. You can't say, "Hey, for 9 months, whatever I told my husband, he just bought it. So, I'm going to try and keep this baby." See, now sister Colleen will be the perfect example. She probably can't wait for the baby to come. So, there's only a timeline given for you to bring forth the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; Some people want to bring forth the life of Christ after the rapture. No, now is the time. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Now are we the sons of God." &gt;&gt; Do you know what happens when you go overturn? Emergency procedures must be taken. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Emergency procedures must be taken. &gt;&gt; I know some of you feel like you're having a C-section right now. &gt;&gt; But that's what we're trying to do. &gt;&gt; We are performing emergency procedure even now. Trying to perform a C-section to get the life of Christ out of us. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't want stillborn babies. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want people who can't say a good hallelujah, a good praise the Lord, a good amen. Holy Ghost have filmed religion. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Uh let's get to that quote. I think it's the first quote there. Amen. Praise the Lord. Talking about it says just previous of this chapter. Amen. Now, watch. But I promise you, I won't go over time, right? We'll get to as much as we can. &gt;&gt; But please take something with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just the previous chapter, we find one place where the son of God spends so much time in prayer. &gt;&gt; And if Jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit. Oh, so now I know why I need to pray. Now I know why I feel so disconnected from the spirit because I haven't prayed for the whole week. &gt;&gt; And you know how it starts? It starts where you miss a day. &gt;&gt; Then you miss two days. &gt;&gt; You see remember the frog in the &gt;&gt; tub. &gt;&gt; If you put hot water, it jumps out slowly. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He makes you ticky talk. Tik Tok is better than praying because you scroll mindlessly. Facebook is better than praying. WhatsApp status is better than praying. I'm not saying it is, but that's how Satan sells it. &gt;&gt; Before you know it, it used to be maybe 5 minutes in the toilet. Now 1 hour. Hey, am I speaking truth? &gt;&gt; Maybe it's not you. Maybe it's your neighbor. 1 hour gone. You know everyone's story now. Okay. Everybody's story. The Bible says in the last days, people will be lovers of their own self. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. People will be lovers of their &gt;&gt; own selves. Heavy highminded. &gt;&gt; Is that the Bible? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why you think they call it YouTube? &gt;&gt; It's all about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. YouTube. Any of you can start a YouTube channel. &gt;&gt; Any of you can start a Tik Tok channel and it's all about you. Amen. So, let's finish reading this quote. The son of God spends so much time in prayer. And if Jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him, how much more do you and I have to spend in prayer? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes I know that we'll forget the quote. So, I want us all to read it. When you read something, you retain it in your knowledge. So, let's start. And if Jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him, how much more do you and I have to spend in prayer? Right. Next one. Much time in prayer. If you only knew what time in prayer meant. Sometimes when you're in prayer, God changes the complete destination of different things that's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So prayer can change &gt;&gt; so prayer becomes a &gt;&gt; key. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hezekiah, you're going to die. &gt;&gt; Prayer can change it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Jonah speaking to Nineveh, you're going to die. &gt;&gt; But repenting sackloth and ashes and prayer can change it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Ahab, you're not walking. But Aab walks softly. &gt;&gt; And God said, look how Ahab has turned and he's walking softly before me. I won't bring judgment in these days. I'll bring it upon his son. &gt;&gt; You mean prayer can change the heart of God? &gt;&gt; So prayer is communication. &gt;&gt; So you mean a man loves communication? the complete destination of different things. Now watch, he says different things. Whatever your situation is, &gt;&gt; prayer can change it. &gt;&gt; Even now, &gt;&gt; I know some of you have been praying for a year, for two years for things, I'm saying even now, prayer can change it. &gt;&gt; Prayer can change it. Young people, hear me when I say the value of prayer. What is prayer for? To connect with the Holy We just read that prayer can change things in your life. Young people, if you ever going through things in your life, you don't know who to turn to, pray. &gt;&gt; Pray. &gt;&gt; You may not have access to Ramapoza, &gt;&gt; but you got access to the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; You got access to the Lord of Lords. So he says when you're in prayer, God changes a complete destination of different things that's going to happen. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's keep reading. Might be something fixing to happen and your prayer could change the whole situation. &gt;&gt; Now listen, your prayer could change the whole situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So yes, you may be able to phone brother Romesh and say, "Brother, pray for me." But he says your prayer &gt;&gt; could change the whole situation. Well, you're saying if God knows it's going to happen, what would my prayer do right now? Maybe that's a question among the young people. What purpose is my prayer? What would my prayer do? You remember now he's talking about Jesus. You remember when Jesus was standing there looking upon the harvest, he was the Lord of the harvest. &gt;&gt; He said the harvest is ripe &gt;&gt; and the laborers are few. So Jesus knew there were people to be saved &gt;&gt; and Jesus knew that the laborers are few. But what does he do? He doesn't just automatically sends them. What does he say? &gt;&gt; Pray. I know there are people to be saved and I know there are few laborers but I need to connect with the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To pray. &gt;&gt; Is this Bible? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pray ye the Lord of the harvest that he will send laborers into his harvest. So if people didn't pray, would laborers go forth? &gt;&gt; I wonder if that's why there are very few evangelists on the field today because people have stopped praying. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have made up our minds that outreach doesn't work. We made it up. &gt;&gt; Voice of God made up their mind. We won't print books anymore. &gt;&gt; Somebody made up their mind that their method and their idea of things is the way it should be. But here, okay, let's break this down. Your prayer activates Jesus to sends out evangelists. &gt;&gt; Is that what the scripture is saying? &gt;&gt; Your prayer pray the Lord of the harvest which is Jesus that he will send laborers into the harvest. &gt;&gt; Am I reading wrong? &gt;&gt; So is it depending on your prayer? Let's continue reading. You'll see what the prophet is saying. In other words, pray to me that I will send laborers into my harvest which I'm just telling you it's such a needy thing. &gt;&gt; So Jesus recognizes the need for lost souls and he's saying but it's connected to your prayer. Is somebody getting this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; You know the prophet even says if you can't go &gt;&gt; he says sometimes you got an evangelist he says you can pray for him. He says sometimes if you got a dollar you can give him so he can go. &gt;&gt; He says maybe you can't go. &gt;&gt; But we know these things but do we do it? &gt;&gt; Jesus says happy are ye if you do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Let's just keep reading. We're going to close on this. You can see I closed my laptop. This is the last quote we're reading. But now watch I'm just I've just explained it but watch how the prophet now further is going to confirm what I'm saying. Part of it lays in somebody say me. Part of it lays in me. &gt;&gt; Do you believe this? The kingdom of God lays within the human. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in one place, I am the vine. You are the branches. &gt;&gt; The vine can't bear fruit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The branches in the vine bear fruit. &gt;&gt; God cannot bear fruit of himself. Wow. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I thought all things are possible. God works according to his law. &gt;&gt; God works according to his nature. &gt;&gt; God works according to his characteristics. So he won't bypass the law. &gt;&gt; There's a there's a quote in the in the rapture message. Jesus wants fruit for himself. &gt;&gt; Right now here this quote is saying God can't bear fruit of himself. It's got to take the Somebody say me. It's got to take me. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; It's got to take you branches to bear fruit. &gt;&gt; And when you branches are yielded to the vine, then fruit can come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fruit comes forth. See what I mean? God wants. Somebody say, "My hands." &gt;&gt; My hands. &gt;&gt; He wants my eyes. Somebody say, "My eyes." &gt;&gt; My eyes. &gt;&gt; He wants your tongue. Somebody say, "My tongue." &gt;&gt; My tongue. &gt;&gt; He wants your lips. Somebody say my lips. He wants your ears. Somebody say, "My ears." &gt;&gt; My ears. &gt;&gt; Wants your hands and feet &gt;&gt; so he can bring forth fruit through &gt;&gt; me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to We're going to close now. Let's all stand. We're going to read this together and we're going to replace all the times it says yours with mine. Right. And the last word, you to me. Easy enough. Let's read. God wants my hands. He wants my eyes. He wants my tongue. Wants my lips. Wants my ears. Wants my hands and feet so he can bring forth truth through me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a good hand of praise. I know I didn't really get into much of it. Amen. But I believe the Holy Spirit has spoke what is needful for the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we needed a little scrubbing this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe we needed a bit of shaking up. Maybe we needed sourdough bread &gt;&gt; to clean the gut. &gt;&gt; Go and read about about the gut that you can heal your body if you heal your gut. Yes. &gt;&gt; Because sicknesses and diseases come through food. &gt;&gt; If you really want to cleanse your body of toxins and sicknesses, you need to fast. Fasting has healing properties. &gt;&gt; I know some of you feel like I'm telling you to die. I'm telling you to fast, not to die. Fasting will get rid of things in your body you never knew was there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Esther said, "I'll fast three days and three nights." She was wanting to get rid of anything, any hindrances in the flesh. &gt;&gt; How many of you want to say, "Lord, I surrender this morning. &gt;&gt; I come, Lord, and I want to change my ways. I want to change my heart. &gt;&gt; Let's sing. Change my heart. Oh God, from D. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; You believe he's the potter. &gt;&gt; We're just the clay. Change my heart, oh God, [Music] and make it ever true. Make this your prayer. Change my heart. Change my heart. Oh God, make this person now. May I be like you. May I be like you. &gt;&gt; Sing it again. Change my heart. Change my heart, oh God. [Music] Make it ever true. Change my heart, oh God. May I be like you. May I be like you. Sing. You are the potter. Oh, you are the potter. I am the clay. I am. How many of you are molded, broken this morning? Mold me and make me. This is what I pray. Change my heart, oh God. Make it ever true. Change my heart, oh God. [Music] May I be like you. One more time. You are the potter. You are the potter. I am the way. Hold me and make me. This is what I pray. Change my heart, oh God. [Music] Make it ever true. It's the need of the change of hearts. Change my heart. Malachi 4 has come to turn your hearts and may be. &gt;&gt; While the music is playing, I want you to talk to the Lord. Amen. If you need to make yourself right to the Lord, you can go ahead and just talk to him. If you want to thank the Lord, thank him. Thank you for favor that surrounds you like his shield. Thank him. Amen. For his goodness. Thank him for his mercy. Amen. I want everyone to start to pray now. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. This is a time for you to worship. The prophet is after the preaching of the word through worship follows. Amen. Hallelujah. God is waiting on you now to hear from you. Be on speaking terms with God. Oh, tell him how much you love him. Tell him how much you appreciate him. Tell him how much Amen. Oh, it means the world to you. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's just drop the music. Drop the music. Amen. There's a resentful spirit here. People don't want to surrender. I want you to open up your mouths.
