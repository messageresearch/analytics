[2:18] Amen. And trust that everyone is doing
[2:21] well.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And everyone is blessed in the
[2:23] house of the Lord.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So,
[2:28] praise the Lord. Said, "Sister Hope,
[2:31] Amen. God bless you." Amen. Came up,
[2:33] brother David. Let's give him a hand and
[2:34] welcome him. [applause]
[2:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:39] Brother Sun, you're not here this
[2:40] morning. Okay. But he arrived back
[2:42] safely. Okay. So, he arrived back
[2:44] yesterday. Amen. From his strip. Sister
[2:46] Lilies, we pray. Amen. They'll recover
[2:48] well. Amen. We have Sister Chan also
[2:50] with us this morning. Amen.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our sister Matilda's mom, let's
[2:53] give her a hand and welcome her. No
[2:55] stranger to us. She was also baptized
[2:57] here a few years ago. Amen. So we pray
[2:59] that the Lord will continue to be with
[3:01] her even as she fellowships with us this
[3:03] morning. Amen. And then also our
[3:05] condolences to Pastor Denel, brother
[3:08] Pubalan Ariu. Amen. Passed on. He was 71
[3:12] years old. He just turned 71 on
[3:14] Thursday. Then he passed on on Friday.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Lord determines our times
[3:19] and our seasons.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The thing is to be ready at
[3:22] all times and be prepared at all times.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So,
[3:27] uh, excuse me if I don't stay to
[3:29] fellowship with you after the service.
[3:31] I've got to rush off straight there
[3:32] because I'm preaching at that funeral
[3:34] service. Amen. So, I pray that it'll all
[3:37] be in order so you don't think I ignored
[3:39] you and I rushed away. Amen. I'm not
[3:41] avoiding you. I just got to go straight
[3:43] to Mia Bank and minister there. Amen.
[3:45] So, let's turn to the word of the Lord.
[3:48] Let's turn to Jeremiah 29:1.
[3:52] Praise the Lord.
[4:06] Jeremiah 29:1 says, "I know the thoughts
[4:11] &gt;&gt; that I think toward you."
[4:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, other translations will say,
[4:16] "I know the plans." Amen. How God plans.
[4:20] I know the thoughts that I think toward
[4:22] you, say the Lord. Thoughts of peace and
[4:25] not of evil
[4:28] &gt;&gt; to give you an expected end.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe in this life, we don't know
[4:32] where our lives are heading, but God
[4:33] knows exactly what our end is.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know the thoughts that I think
[4:37] toward you, say the Lord, thoughts of
[4:39] peace, not of evil, to give you an
[4:42] expected end.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; Now, how does God plan? You might ask.
[4:45] If he knows the plan for our lives,
[4:48] let's go to Isaiah 46 and verse 10 and
[4:51] see how God plans. Amen. Isaiah 46 and
[4:54] verse 10 says, "Declaring the end from
[4:58] the beginning."
[4:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; Now, pay attention to that. God plans
[5:02] the end of it.
[5:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:03] &gt;&gt; First.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Declaring the end from
[5:08] the beginning and from ancient times,
[5:10] the things that are not yet done,
[5:13] saying, "My counsel shall stand and I
[5:15] will do all my pleasure."
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So God determines the
[5:20] end. Then he goes back to the beginning
[5:22] and he works his plan.
[5:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Calling a ravenous bird
[5:30] from the east, that the man that
[5:31] executed my counsel from a far country.
[5:34] Yay, I have spoken it. I will also bring
[5:37] it to pass. I have purposed it. I will
[5:39] also do it.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, whatever God purposes,
[5:43] whatever his plan is, he's going to
[5:45] bring it to pass. Amen. You may be
[5:47] seated. The Lord had blessings through
[5:48] the reading of his word. [clears throat]
[5:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:53] So, we'll just lay these two more
[5:55] scriptures and we'll continue in
[5:57] Jeremiah 1 and verse 5. I don't have it
[6:00] there, brother. You'll pick it up. Amen.
[6:02] When you search it, God is telling the
[6:05] prophet, "Before I formed thee in the
[6:07] belly, I knew thee. [clears throat]
[6:09] And before thou camest forth out of the
[6:11] womb, I sanctified thee, and I ordained
[6:14] thee a prophet unto the nations."
[6:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; So God has purpose for each and every
[6:20] one of our lives.
[6:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; God knew about our birth before we were
[6:25] formed in the belly of our mom.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before thy king was forth from the
[6:30] womb, I sanctified thee.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:35] &gt;&gt; God has sanctified each one of us for a
[6:37] purpose to fulfill a purpose on the
[6:39] earth.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:40] &gt;&gt; AND THEN HE ALSO GIVES US WHEN GOD CALLS
[6:42] A MAN, he equips a man.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. WHEN GOD ORDAINS A
[6:47] MAN, HE GIVES HIM the necessary tools in
[6:49] this life to make it through. And here
[6:51] he says, I have ordained THEE A PROPHET
[6:53] UNTO the nations.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we we know that under our
[6:56] message under Revelation 10:8-11, we are
[6:59] asked to prophesy again.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; SO GOD HAS ORDAINED US TO PROPHESY to
[7:04] nations.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In Romans 9:11, uh for
[7:10] the children not being yet born, neither
[7:13] having done any good or evil, that the
[7:15] purpose OF GOD ACCORDING TO ELECTION
[7:18] might stand.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; Not of works, but of him that calleth.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. DON'T LOOK AT ME FOR MY MISTAKES.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; DON'T LOOK AT ME FOR MY FAULTS. DON'T
[7:28] LOOK AT ME FOR MY WORKS. AMEN. I'M HERE
[7:30] TO FULFILL THE PURPOSE OF GOD.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [cheering] AMEN.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; Moses had his mistakes.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T LOOK AT MOSES MISTAKES.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; PETER DENIED THE LORD THREE TIMES. GOD
[7:42] DIDN'T LOOK AT PETER'S MISTAKES. GOD
[7:44] LOOKED AT THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH HE HAD
[7:46] DESIGNED THEIR LIVES FOR.
[7:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; Because if you look at Peter, Peter
[7:52] denied THE LORD.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; BUT JUDAS BETRAYED THE LORD.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WERE BOTH FOR DIFFERENT
[7:58] PURPOSES ON THE EARTH.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Because if YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE
[8:01] BETWEEN DENIAL and betrayal,
[8:05] &gt;&gt; one denied, one betrayed.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. BUT THEY BOTH WERE
[8:10] SERVING DIFFERENT PURPOSE.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; BUT THE PURPOSE OF GOD ACCORDING TO YOUR
[8:14] ELECTION will stand.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the children not yet born. I'm
[8:21] showing you how God plans
[8:23] &gt;&gt; before they are born. He planned he has
[8:26] a purpose for your life. Neither having
[8:28] done any good or evil. So God is not
[8:30] choosing based on good or evil.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; That the purpose of God according to
[8:34] election might stand not of works but of
[8:37] him that calleth. It was said unto her,
[8:40] "The elders shall serve the younger. As
[8:42] it is written, Jacob have I loved, but
[8:45] Esau have I hated."
[8:48] So don't get upset when God says he
[8:49] hates denomination.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; You say WHERE THE PROPHET TOLD US GOD
[8:53] HATES DENOMINATION.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; He hates the very idea of denominations.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; So God HATES DENOMINATION BUT HE LOVES
[8:59] US.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; SO HE CALLED US OUT OF EVERY
[9:01] DENOMINATION.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now the prophet of God
[9:05] says here God made a plan for man to be
[9:09] saved and man cannot add anything to
[9:11] that plan.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; It's God's plan.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[9:17] So our GOD IS A GREAT BIG PLANNER.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "BUT LONG BEFORE TIME
[9:25] EVER BEGAN, this was all planned in the
[9:28] wisdom of God." And God ALL GOD ALWAYS
[9:31] HAS EVERYTHING JUST at the minute.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; Every minute of our lives IS DETAILED.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; WE MAY SAY WE ARE BORED. WE DON'T KNOW
[9:39] WHAT TO DO WITH TIME. BUT GOD HAS
[9:41] DETERMINED EVERY MOMENT OF OUR TIME.
[9:43] AMEN.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; We can choose to waste it or we can
[9:45] choose to serve the purpose of God.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; You know the prophet of God also says a
[9:51] son of God can go for years
[9:54] wandering around.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; Not fulfilling God's purpose. He says
[9:58] but if he's a son he will come back.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now second Peter 1 and verse4 says
[10:06] this.
[10:08] Amen.
[10:09] whereby I given unto us exceeding great
[10:11] and precious promises, that by these you
[10:15] might be partakers of the divine nature,
[10:18] &gt;&gt; having escaped the corruption that is in
[10:20] the world through lust.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, notice, God is
[10:25] TELLING US, WE HAVE ALREADY ESCAPED.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; We have ALREADY ESCAPED THE CORRUPTION
[10:30] OF THE WORLD. But what's the point I
[10:33] want to get to? WE ARE PARTAKERS OF HIS
[10:35] DIVINE NATURE. YES.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; And I want TO SHOW YOU THIS MORNING A
[10:39] PART OF AN ATTRIBUTE OF GOD'S divine
[10:40] nature is to plan.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; If we ever want to succeed IN ANYTHING
[10:46] IN LIFE, AMEN. There's got to be a plan.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; So God, a planning IS THE HIGHEST FORM
[10:55] OF GOD'S DIVINE NATURE.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF HIS DIVINE NATURE
[11:00] IS TO HAVE A PLAN.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[11:04] GOD PLANNED THE DEATH OF JESUS BEFORE
[11:06] THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. THE LAMB WAS SLAIN BEFORE THE
[11:15] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's just read some
[11:18] things that God did before the
[11:19] foundation of the world. Ephesians 1:4
[11:21] says, "According as he had chosen us."
[11:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; In him BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[11:29] WORLD.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; You mean before man fell, he chose us.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; That's how GOD CHOOSES US. GOD IS A
[11:36] PLANNER.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; God planned for success.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; God planned so these attributes can be
[11:43] made manifest.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; GOD PLANNED FOR YOU TO BE SITTING HERE
[11:46] THIS MORNING.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; GOD CLEARED ALL THE OBSTACLES THAT WERE
[11:49] COMING IN YOUR WAY. ALL THE THOUGHTS
[11:51] THAT WERE COMING IN YOUR MIND. GOD
[11:53] CLEARED IT ALL. AMEN. AND MADE A WAY FOR
[11:55] YOU TO COME HERE THIS MORNING to hear
[11:57] the word of God.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; So according as he had chosen us in him.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; SO IF HE CHOSE ME BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[12:05] OF THE WORLD, AMEN. I CAN'T FAIL.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; IF I FAIL, THE PURPOSE OF GOD FAILS.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; I WAS CHOSEN IN HIM BEFORE THE
[12:13] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Satan may WANT TO TRIP ME UP. SATAN MAY
[12:17] WANT TO COME AGAINST ME. AMEN. But Satan
[12:19] is defeated.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; Christ has defeated him on the cross.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. NOT ONLY HAS HE HAD CHOSEN US, BUT
[12:27] HE HAS ALREADY SAID THAT WE SHOULD BE
[12:29] HOLY AND WITHOUT BLAME before him in
[12:32] love.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; So I am blameless.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; I AM HOLY BECAUSE I AM IN CHRIST.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; I BEAR NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR FALLEN MAN.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; YES.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; What fallen man? This nature is a sticky
[12:47] nature.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE PRO PROPHET OF GOD SAYS YOU'RE
[12:51] ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS with a
[12:52] sticky NATURE IN THIS LIFE. AMEN.
[12:54] BECAUSE THE BODY, the flesh IS NOT
[12:56] REDEEMED,
[12:57] &gt;&gt; BUT OUR SOUL HAS BEEN REDEEMED.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But we've got to STRENGTHEN THE
[13:01] INNER MAN. WE'VE GOT TO STRENGTHEN THE
[13:03] spirit man. Amen. Strengthen the soul.
[13:05] Amen. AND BRING THE FLESH UNDER
[13:07] SUBJECTION
[13:08] &gt;&gt; UNTIL WE ARE DELIVERED FROM THIS VILE
[13:10] OLD BODY.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we are finding we
[13:14] were chosen in before the foundation of
[13:16] the world. We was he made us holy and
[13:18] without blame before him in love. Amen.
[13:21] uh here in John 17:24 he says, "Father,
[13:25] I will that they also whom thou has
[13:27] given me."
[13:30] &gt;&gt; He gave us to him before the foundation
[13:32] of the world.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; When God thought of Jesus CHRIST, HE
[13:36] THOUGHT OF HIM IN BOTH MASCULINE and
[13:38] feminine.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Because male and female created them.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam and Eve was a mystery
[13:46] &gt;&gt; of Christ and his bride.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; He says, "Thou whom thou has given me be
[13:52] with me where I am
[13:55] &gt;&gt; that they may behold my glory which thou
[13:58] has given me for thou lovest me before
[14:00] the foundation of the world."
[14:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; In 1 Peter 1 [clears throat] Peter 1:18,
[14:10] it says here verse 19, let's read 19.
[14:13] but with the precious blood of Jesus as
[14:16] of a lamb without blemish and without
[14:18] spot who was who verily was for him
[14:21] before the foundation of the world but
[14:23] was manifest in these last times for
[14:25] you.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the lamb was without
[14:30] blemish. The lamb was without spot
[14:32] before the foundation of the world. One
[14:34] more portion of scripture in revelation
[14:36] 13:8 it says and they that dwell on the
[14:39] earth shall worship him whose names are
[14:41] not written in the book of life of the
[14:43] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[14:46] world. So we are learning two things
[14:47] from here. The lamb is slain from before
[14:49] the foundation of the world and their
[14:51] names written in the book from before
[14:52] the foundation of the world.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; So God has a plan and is called the plan
[14:58] of redemption.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. AMEN. SO GOD PLANNED
[15:04] THE DEATH OF JESUS FOR 4,000 years
[15:06] before Jesus came to earth.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:13] We know that it was longer because we
[15:15] just read that he he planned his death
[15:17] from before the foundation of the world.
[15:19] But if we are counting, Amen. just time,
[15:22] it's 4,000 years. Before man fell, God
[15:24] planned.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; God plans when things doesn't seem
[15:28] necessary.
[15:31] Praise the Lord.
[15:33] Now I also got to say this here that we
[15:35] were created in the image and likeness
[15:36] of God
[15:38] &gt;&gt; and we ought to function like God
[15:41] &gt;&gt; we can't be living aimless lives and
[15:42] walking without a plan
[15:44] &gt;&gt; in the message. Amen. What it takes to
[15:45] overcome the prophet says our faith.
[15:47] Amen. He says that uh a beggar came to
[15:51] his home and knocked on the door and
[15:53] asked for some food and he told his wife
[15:56] to fix the man some food. Amen. So after
[15:59] she fixed him some food, he he got down
[16:01] and he started to talk to this man and
[16:03] he says, "Oh, where you coming from?" He
[16:05] says, "Oh, nowhere.
[16:08] Where you going to?" "Nowhere."
[16:12] "What's your plan in life?" "Oh,
[16:14] whatever comes." The prophet says we
[16:16] shouldn't be like that.
[16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "IF GOD PUT US ON THE
[16:20] EARTH, HE PUT US HERE FOR A PURPOSE."
[16:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; We should be living our lives ACCORDING
[16:25] TO THE PLAN OF GOD.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; YES. ACCORDING TO THE PURPOSE OF GOD.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; If we start out right, we'll end right.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; So, we are finding THAT BEFORE MAN FELL,
[16:36] GOD PLANNED.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; God plans for things that don't seem
[16:41] necessary at the time.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MAN HAD NOT FALLEN when when the
[16:45] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[16:47] the world.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; He hadn't even created MAN.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD HE PLAN FOR THE FALL?
[16:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; He plans for things, AMEN. THAT ARE
[16:55] UNEXPECTED.
[16:57] Praise the Lord.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; God planned for our salvation before MAN
[17:01] WAS CREATED. CALVARY was planned IN
[17:03] ETERNITY.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; IT'S CALLED A PLAN OF REDEMPTION.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD PLANS, HE PLANS IN DETAIL.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD'S PLANS ARE ELABORATE.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; YEAH. The prophet of God in things that
[17:14] are to be. He says, "Your birth," Amen.
[17:16] Paragraph 25, things that are to be.
[17:19] Your birth year was pre-planned. I guess
[17:22] you believe that. Every one of you knows
[17:24] that our birth was pre-planned.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Now, when he's talking about this
[17:29] pre-planned, HE'S NOT TALKING about your
[17:31] mother and father sitting and talking
[17:32] and saying, "We think we should have a
[17:34] son."
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; He's talking about God.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; God pre-planned your birth.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; God pre-planned your coming on the
[17:41] earth.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Bless you, brother Nathaniel. AMEN. GOD
[17:47] PRE-PLANNED THAT YOU SHOULD BE HERE.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE A MISTAKE. IN FACT,
[17:52] SOMETIMES MOTHERS AND FATHERS SAY, "YOU
[17:53] know what? You were a mistake. YOU ARE
[17:55] NOT A MISTAKE."
[17:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN. COME ON, BROTHER. AMEN.
[17:58] HALLELUJAH.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LIFE COMES FROM GOD.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU COMING HERE ON THE EARTH IS
[18:05] NOT A MISTAKE.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; YOU COMING HERE ON THE EARTH IS NOT BY
[18:08] CHANCE.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We know the atheists
[18:12] AND THESE PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN
[18:13] GOD SAYS, "OH, NO. WE JUST EVOLVED."
[18:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. They came here from monkeys. THEY
[18:18] SAY
[18:19] &gt;&gt; FROM CHIMPANZEES.
[18:21] PRAISE THE LORD. YOU KNOW THE story
[18:22] about the mother and father that were
[18:24] talking to the child and the child want
[18:26] to know where did we come from?
[18:28] &gt;&gt; And he goes to ask the mother where we
[18:29] came from and the the the mother says no
[18:32] you know God created us in his own image
[18:34] in his own likeness and God spoke us and
[18:37] he created us from the dust of the
[18:38] earth. And then he goes to the father
[18:41] and says dad where did we come from? The
[18:44] father says no we evolved from
[18:46] chimpanzees. So the child goes back to
[18:48] the mother and says, "Mom, dad says we
[18:50] came from chimpanzees." So the mom says,
[18:52] "No, he's talking about his side of the
[18:54] family."
[18:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; But we are talking about our side this
[19:00] morning.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; That our birth was pre-planned.
[19:03] [cheering]
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Every one of you knows that our birth
[19:06] WAS PRE-PLANNED. SO DON'T LET anybody
[19:08] tell you that you are not good enough.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; That you have no purpose on the earth.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU HAVE A PURPOSE. GOD
[19:15] PRE-PLANNED YOUR LIFE.
[19:16] AMEN.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Did you know that your being here never
[19:19] originated just and a myth or a thought?
[19:22] Everything was pre-planned by God.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation OF THE WORLD, THAT
[19:27] YOU WOULD BE HERE.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; I also WANT TO SAY GOD COULD HAVE
[19:31] PRE-PLANNED FOR YOU TO BE IN the age of
[19:33] Paul.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; He could have allowed YOU TO BE FED to
[19:36] lions
[19:37] &gt;&gt; to be se.
[19:40] Amen. But God had PRE-PLANNED AND HE
[19:42] CHOSE YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR GENE SEED.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT YOU CAN WITHSTAND
[19:46] DECEPTION.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; YOUR CHAIN SEED WON'T ALLOW YOU TO BE
[19:49] DECEIVED in this season.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Your gene seed is what? TO RECEIVE THE
[19:53] PROPHETIC WORD OF THIS HOUR.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; TO RECEIVE MALACHI 4, TO RECEIVE
[19:57] REVELATION 10:7. AMEN. YOUR GENE SEED
[20:00] WAS GENETICALLY CODED TO RECEIVE THIS
[20:02] WORD OF THIS DAY.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. LUTHER'S GENE SEED WAS
[20:07] NOT GENETICALLY DESIGNED to receive the
[20:09] full open word. HE HAD ONE PART OF HIS
[20:12] WORD AND HIS GEN WAS GENETICALLY CODED
[20:14] TO RECEIVE JUSTIFICATION.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; WESLEY WAS AMEN CODED TO RECEIVE
[20:19] JUSTIFICATION AND SANCTIFICATION. THE
[20:21] EARLY PENTECOSTALS, AMEN, WAS DESIGNED
[20:23] TO RECEIVE THE RESTORATION OF THE GIFTS.
[20:25] BUT THIS IS NO ORDINARY TIME SEASON. GOD
[20:27] HAS A SUPERASS OF PEOPLE ON THE EARTH
[20:29] RIGHT NOW. GOD HAS A SUPER RACE ON THE
[20:32] EARTH RIGHT NOW. THIS SUPER RACE IS
[20:34] GENETICALLY CODED, AMEN, to withstand
[20:36] SATAN'S SCHEMES.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; WILL NOT BE LIKE EVE. AMEN.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; HE STAND FOR THE WORD.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; HE STAND FOR THE TRUTH.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; OH, SOMEBODY GIVE GOD PRAISE IN HIS
[20:46] PLACE. [cheering]
[20:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; GLORY, GLORY, GLORY.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD THAT I WAS PRE-PLANNED by
[20:52] God.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; The infinite God knew. And to be
[20:58] infinite, he had to know every flea that
[21:00] was ever be on the earth.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Now, God has a plan. In the prophecies
[21:08] in the oneness of unity,
[21:11] God has a plan and the devil has a plan.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Now we are seeing a counter plan.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the devil IS TRYING TO
[21:19] GET ALL PEOPLE UNDER HIS PLAN WHILE GOD
[21:22] IS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO BE UNDER HIS
[21:24] PLAN.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; SO I ASK YOU, WHOSE PLAN ARE YOU
[21:26] FOLLOWING THIS MORNING?
[21:27] &gt;&gt; JESUS.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; There's a straight way and there's a NAR
[21:30] AMEN. THERE'S A BROAD WAY and a narrow
[21:32] way.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. BUT WATCH, THERE ARE
[21:36] TWO FORCES PULLING YOU. ONE WANTS TO
[21:38] PULL YOU to the devil's plan. One who
[21:40] wants to pull you TO GOD'S PLAN. I'M
[21:42] ASKING YOU WHOSE PLAN ARE YOU FOLLOWING?
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Some people say, you know, God's plan is
[21:47] here on the left, on the right. God's
[21:50] Satan's plan is on the left. I want to
[21:51] stay in middle of the road.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; So, they got one foot on God's plan, one
[21:55] foot in Satan's plan.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; And they're trying to say, "I'm staying
[21:58] middle of the road." No.
[22:01] You know the prophet of God says he was
[22:03] they were talking about this man and and
[22:04] the the trail that was going up to the
[22:06] mountain.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; Any of you know that story?
[22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says, "Amen, that
[22:12] they speak spoke to this people that
[22:14] were going to drive this cab up the
[22:16] mountain and it was narrow crevices and
[22:19] pathway." And the one says, "No me, I go
[22:21] very fast. I go and you know I maneuver.
[22:25] I'm skilled in these things here." And
[22:28] the other one says, "No, I go as close
[22:30] as possible to the edge. I give you a
[22:31] thrill."
[22:33] And then he came found an older man
[22:35] there and he says, "No, I don't know if
[22:36] I'm the right one for you. Me, I go very
[22:38] slow and I stay as far away from that
[22:41] curb as possible, the edge." He says,
[22:43] "You're the man for the job."
[22:46] &gt;&gt; We want to stay away from the devil's
[22:47] plan.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; We don't want one foot in the world and
[22:52] one foot in the church.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus even when he's
[22:57] reprimanding this age, the seven church
[22:59] age, he says, I would THAT THEY WERE HOT
[23:01] OR COLD,
[23:02] &gt;&gt; but I hate lukewarmness.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; So he says here, God has a plan. The
[23:11] devil has a plan. The devil is trying to
[23:13] get all people under his plan while God
[23:15] is trying to get people under his plan.
[23:17] So there's two great spirits in the
[23:18] world. One of them is the devil. The
[23:20] other is God. The devil has messengers.
[23:23] God has messengers.
[23:24] Amen.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; And we had liberty to make our choice.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; To whom will we y heal ourselves to?
[23:31] That's whose servants we are. You know,
[23:33] we are the some choice. We are the some
[23:35] the person of ourselves is based on our
[23:37] choices.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; Everything in life.
[23:42] But I want you to know that your present
[23:44] is not your past.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Your present circumstance right now.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; You can't base it on your past. That's
[23:53] right.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Whatever you went through in your past,
[23:56] cut it off.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; Don't allow the past to determine your
[24:00] your present.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; So, whatever you went through IN YOUR
[24:03] PAST, YOUR HURTS,
[24:05] PEOPLE BEING AGAINST YOU, WHATEVER
[24:07] TRAUMA YOU FACE IN THIS LIFE, WHEN YOU
[24:10] ARE IN CHRIST, YOU CAN'T CARRY THOSE
[24:12] THINGS INTO a Christian life.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BASE YOUR WALK BASED ON THOSE
[24:17] PAST HURTS, THOSE PAST FEELINGS, AND
[24:19] WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE PAST. YOU CAN'T
[24:21] BE DRIVING FORWARD BY LOOKING IN THE
[24:22] REAR REVIEW MIRROR. COME ON, PEOPLE OF
[24:24] GOD. GOD HAS MADE US PEOPLE OF VISION,
[24:26] PEOPLE OF PURPOSE ON THE EARTH.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; Do you know people can't get past
[24:31] relationships, can't get past traumas,
[24:33] their father did them THIS, THEIR
[24:34] CHILDREN, THEIR DAUGHTERS DID them this.
[24:36] Amen. Their mother did them this. And
[24:38] and if you go and talk to most uh people
[24:40] that's having problems in this life, you
[24:43] go and see you talk to people and
[24:46] psychologists have spoken to people that
[24:48] uh give themselves over to prostitution
[24:51] and and all of these things, they trace
[24:52] it back to a trauma in their childhood.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; All these women that's into pornography
[24:57] and all of these things.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Somewhere along the line, they were
[25:00] abused as a child.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; And these things carry this trauma
[25:04] carries into them.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:08] And and even like uh children's their
[25:10] upbringing if you find you find a a
[25:13] child doesn't recover from the fact if
[25:14] their mother and father gave them away
[25:17] when they come of age and they realize
[25:18] they were adopted they go on a search to
[25:21] find their parents.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; They want to know their origins.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they are never
[25:28] satisfied. Some of them they may have
[25:30] stayed with their parents for 20 years
[25:32] but they reject those parents.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Trauma
[25:37] Amen. People carrying things in their
[25:39] heart.
[25:41] As we go along, you'll see what the
[25:42] prophet is saying now. So remember, if
[25:45] you are being drawn away from the
[25:47] presence of God, you are being witnessed
[25:49] by messengers. What is the prophet
[25:52] saying? The devil has
[25:54] &gt;&gt; So who can tell me now it's the plan of
[25:57] God for you to miss church?
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Please raise your hand.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; It's God's plan for you to miss church.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[26:05] Praise the Lord.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; So then whose plan are we following
[26:10] &gt;&gt; because God's plan says forsake not the
[26:12] assembling together of yourselves even
[26:14] as you see the day fast approaching.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; That's the word of God.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; We got to move quickly here now. Amen.
[26:20] So when you are
[26:23] when you are planning
[26:25] when you have a plan and a desire to
[26:27] serve God and the things of God,
[26:29] remember your first plan should be to
[26:30] seek the kingdom of God.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Before you plan for a wife, for a
[26:35] husband, before you plan for a job,
[26:37] before you plan for anything else, the
[26:39] Bible says, "Seek ye first the kingdom
[26:41] of God."
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; THAT SHOULD BE OUR FIRST PLAN.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; I I don't care about any other thing,
[26:47] Lord. I want to pursue your plan, the
[26:51] kingdom of God. I need the Holy Ghost.
[26:53] That should be the first plan.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; You know that that's how the kingdom
[26:58] operates. We go trying to pursue the
[27:01] material things first. But God says,
[27:04] "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[27:06] I'll add other things."
[27:08] &gt;&gt; It comes automatically. I'll add this
[27:10] and I'll add this.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Just prior to that, he's talking about
[27:14] clothing and food and all of these
[27:15] things. He says, "But if you seek the
[27:17] kingdom of God, I'll add the other
[27:19] things automatically."
[27:22] &gt;&gt; When we are in his kingdom, we become
[27:24] his responsibility.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; We can't be saying, "My father owns a
[27:29] cattle on a thousand hill, but yet we
[27:32] are starving."
[27:33] &gt;&gt; What cattle? Why you don't kill the
[27:34] cattle and eat it? But we are saying,
[27:37] "My father owns a cattle on a thousand
[27:38] hill."
[27:40] Praise the Lord.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; We need to know how to operate in the
[27:44] kingdom of God.
[27:45] I didn't read in the Bible where Abraham
[27:47] was starving.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Somebody walk with me.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; God blessed Abraham.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:59] So
[28:01] when we are plann to plan is to have an
[28:04] attribute of God.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; If I come and ask you what's the plan
[28:08] for your life and if you got no plan for
[28:10] your life then something is wrong.
[28:13] Praise the Lord.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; If you have no plan, the Bible says
[28:17] where there is no vision, the people
[28:19] perish.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; What is your vision? The Bible also says
[28:22] in Abac, write the vision.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; Make it plain.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Let me see your vision. Let me see your
[28:28] plan.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Where are you heading to? I'm talking
[28:33] not just spiritual now. Even though we
[28:34] are focusing on spiritual, I'm trying to
[28:36] bring it down in a broader sense to show
[28:38] you in your natural life, what is your
[28:39] plan? How come you can plan for other
[28:42] things in your life, but you can't plan
[28:43] for the things of God?
[28:46] &gt;&gt; When you come of age, the first thing
[28:48] you want to do when you turn 16, what's
[28:50] the legal age to get learners now? 16
[28:54] &gt;&gt; 18 16 first thing you know very quickly
[28:58] you go a plan now to get the learners.
[29:01] Praise the Lord.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; The Bible says or the prophet of God
[29:04] says age of accountability is 12.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Right? So you bypass that planning
[29:11] stage. Now you've gone to 16. So now you
[29:14] want learners without the Holy Ghost.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; You bypassed the first step which was
[29:20] seeking first the kingdom.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; And now you want learners.
[29:24] Then you became 18. You want driver's
[29:26] license.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; You want to get all of these things
[29:28] without the Holy Ghost.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; So which means our building plan is
[29:33] disfigured. We are not building the
[29:35] foundation. Right.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God also says we build
[29:38] according to a plan. How many of you
[29:39] know it's illegal to build without a
[29:41] plan?
[29:43] &gt;&gt; How many of you know the prophet of God
[29:44] says the natural types are spiritual?
[29:46] &gt;&gt; It's illegal to build without a plan.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS OUR PLAN? WHAT IS OUR PURPOSE?
[29:56] You know, we've been preaching things
[29:57] here and and I I don't know if you've
[29:59] been receiving it or not, but I tell
[30:01] you, lives are changing.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; People's lives are being transformed.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; We are getting testimonies. Amen. From
[30:07] even beyond the church. Amen.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; I'll share this very quick testimony. We
[30:15] don't have time to play it for you. How
[30:16] many of you know brother stringy was in
[30:17] this church?
[30:19] &gt;&gt; How many of you know him?
[30:20] &gt;&gt; You remember him? So on the Monday they
[30:23] were fasting and praying. They asked me
[30:24] to come preach there and I preached
[30:25] certain things and the brother is giving
[30:27] a testimony just a week later.
[30:31] The brother was blacklisted.
[30:33] 70,000 rand in debt. You know when you
[30:35] get blacklisted you can't get
[30:37] &gt;&gt; financed. How many of you know that?
[30:39] &gt;&gt; If you're black, listen, I'm giving you
[30:40] this testimony for a reason. If you are
[30:41] blacklisted, God can bypass procedures.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; And I started to speak to them about how
[30:46] God can bypass procedures and how God
[30:48] Amen. Uh speaking about Jabz and how he
[30:51] bypassed procedures of asking the
[30:53] elders, he went straight to God.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God granted him
[30:58] everything that he had desired.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; And I spoke about Samad and how that
[31:02] building was tied up in legal work. But
[31:04] the prophet prayed
[31:06] &gt;&gt; and the brother Sam and dear phon the
[31:08] prophet to say I don't know what
[31:09] happened but all the the the legal work
[31:11] came right and I'm now the owner of this
[31:12] building.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So uh you know I was
[31:16] preaching that week on faith and I was
[31:17] telling him ask God for big things like
[31:19] the prophet says ask him for big things.
[31:21] He can do big things for you as much as
[31:23] he can do small things. And he says, you
[31:25] know, they they were driving a little
[31:26] car and they were all squashed up in the
[31:28] car and he's got big children. And he
[31:29] said, Lord, there's one thing I need is
[31:31] a vehicle.
[31:34] And he said he had a desire. He says by
[31:36] the Thursday, he was looking at some
[31:37] vehicle. And they phoned him on Friday.
[31:40] And they phoned him and to ask him, you
[31:43] know, are you going to be paying for
[31:44] this cash or you going to be paying
[31:45] finance? He says, I don't have the cash
[31:47] and I can't apply for finance because
[31:48] I'm blacklisted.
[31:51] He got blacklisted in 2023.
[31:54] So, you know, in 2025, it's not
[31:56] possible. You'll be on ITC. You'll be on
[31:59] every bank record. I know because I work
[32:01] with vehicle finance. So, if you don't,
[32:03] you don't know and you don't want to
[32:04] believe me, believe me.
[32:07] I'm telling you, we know all these
[32:09] cases. They apply for finance every day.
[32:10] They're blacklisted. Amen. ITC, debt
[32:13] counseling, debt review, and all of
[32:14] these things.
[32:16] So, [clears throat] the the sales lady
[32:18] tells him, you know, why don't you apply
[32:20] for finance? And he says, I can't apply
[32:22] for finance. I'm blacklisted. She kind
[32:24] of convinced him. He said just apply
[32:25] anyway.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; He applies on that Friday. He says
[32:29] within minutes he got a message back to
[32:31] say his finance is approved.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; God can bypass procedures.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; What What did Jesus say in Mark 9:23?
[32:44] Do you know what Jesus said in Mark
[32:45] 9:23?
[32:48] Praise the Lord.
[32:51] All things,
[32:54] &gt;&gt; some things.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; You see, we put limitation on the all
[32:57] things. All things are possible to him
[33:00] that believeth.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; All things.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "No, I'm too old. I'm too
[33:11] this." All things are possible.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; But it's according to what you believe.
[33:17] Jesus many times prayed for. He didn't
[33:19] pray for them. They came to him and he
[33:20] says according to your faith.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; According to your faith.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God can bypass procedures even
[33:30] in your own life.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; No matter if there's legal work or
[33:34] whatever it is, God can bypass
[33:35] procedures. We are serving the King of
[33:37] Kings and God is not governed by earthly
[33:39] standards and man-made laws.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; If God is determined for you to have
[33:44] something, he can bypass procedures and
[33:46] make you have it.
[33:49] Praise the Lord. But we've got to
[33:51] recognize that we are children of his
[33:53] kingdom.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I know some of you don't like this.
[33:57] Some of you don't like this kind of
[33:58] preaching.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some of you saying, you know, bro,
[34:02] you know, there's a fine line there. I
[34:04] don't know what line you see.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Why don't we believe the word of God?
[34:11] [screaming]
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus even said,
[34:14] "You have not because you
[34:19] Jesus said, "You have not because you
[34:22] &gt;&gt; not
[34:23] &gt;&gt; ask not." Praise the Lord. So tell your
[34:27] neighbor a shame for you
[34:30] because my father says I must ask.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and don't get upset and
[34:38] jealous and upset now that this brother
[34:40] is only being blessed.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; They're asking.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; We are heirs of the father. Amen.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Joints with the sun.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; If we have 50/50 bank account, it's not
[34:51] my problem if I'm drawing more money
[34:52] than you.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; We got 50/50 joint account.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; I got a card. You got a card. The
[35:00] prophet says when we were saved, born
[35:02] again, God wrote checks out and he
[35:05] signed it
[35:07] &gt;&gt; and he gave it to us.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Now we're going to keep. Hey, you know
[35:10] me, I like auto. See, Jesus signed his
[35:11] signature here.
[35:13] If I write here and I cash it in, I
[35:15] won't have that signature.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; We are collectors.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; We collect signatures.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; But there's one person cashing it.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Cashing it.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; He even cashed all his checks. He's
[35:25] saying, "Hey, bro, you're not using that
[35:26] check. Let me cash your check, too."
[35:28] [laughter]
[35:29] So other people are living off your
[35:31] blessings because you are poor. You say
[35:33] that's not possible. I tell you it's
[35:34] possible. Come on, put up Matthew 25.
[35:37] Then Jesus gave them equal amount of
[35:39] checks.
[35:41] I can show you scripture for this. Jesus
[35:44] gave them talents.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; One, one invested the talent.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; He spent it.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The other two. Amen. Now watch.
[35:54] These things also come by ability. Don't
[35:57] think that all of us will be
[35:58] millionaires. Yeah. All of us. It comes
[36:00] by ability. Listen to what the Lord says
[36:02] here.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; He gave them talents. One five. So you
[36:06] can't get jealous to say why you gave
[36:07] that one five
[36:08] &gt;&gt; and me too. and another one to every man
[36:11] according to his several ability.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; So the key in the kingdom is to show God
[36:15] you can handle what he has given you
[36:17] then he will multiply it.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Are we reading the
[36:22] Bible here?
[36:24] &gt;&gt; So he's [laughter] giving every man
[36:25] according to his several ability. So not
[36:27] everyone will be millionaires.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Not everyone will be that level but
[36:31] according to what you can handle.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; God knows what you can handle and what
[36:35] will turn your heart away from him.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:38] The thing is, you got to show him you're
[36:39] a good steward and you can manage it
[36:41] wisely.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Now, if you've mismanaged finances, you
[36:44] need to rebuild his trust.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; But here, I'm trying to show you that
[36:48] God is giving out and then if you go up
[36:51] there, you'll see that the one that took
[36:53] the talent and hid it in the ground, the
[36:55] check, hid it in the ground.
[36:57] God didn't have kind words for him.
[36:58] Let's move down there to that last way
[37:00] he's talking about it. Amen. The other
[37:03] two, he multiplied what they had. Amen.
[37:06] But the one that hid it in the ground,
[37:08] he says, "Thou wicked."
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the last guy. THOU WICKED
[37:15] AND SLUTFUL SERVANT. THOU KNEW I reap
[37:18] where I sowed not and gather where I've
[37:20] not saw. What must you do to him? Bind
[37:22] him.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; You ought to put your money to the
[37:26] exchanges. And at my coming I should
[37:27] have received my own with usery.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Therefore, take the talent from him,
[37:32] give him to the one that had 10.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Sure. And everyone that hath shall be
[37:36] given, and he shall have abundance, but
[37:38] from him that hath not shall be taken
[37:40] away, even that which he had. God, don't
[37:42] leave him there now. Come, let's tie him
[37:44] up and bind him now. Cast his
[37:46] unprofitable servant in the outer
[37:47] darkness. There shall be weeping,
[37:49] nashing of teeth.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; So don't think God is feeling, hey, this
[37:52] guy here, he kept what I gave him.
[37:55] What have you done with what's been
[37:56] given to you?
[37:57] &gt;&gt; God wants to see multiplication in his
[37:59] kingdom.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; God's kingdom works by multiplication
[38:02] and addition. Satan's kingdom works by
[38:04] division and subtraction.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; So our plan is to follow God's word
[38:11] which will lead you to ultimate success.
[38:13] And we can be prosperous in this life.
[38:15] Spiritual prosperity first.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Everybody say spiritual prosperity
[38:20] first.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Spiritual prosperity first.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Because God wants his children to
[38:24] prosper. Right?
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Now your dream will always remain a
[38:28] dream as long as there's no plan
[38:30] attached to it. Some people dream their
[38:32] whole life.
[38:35] They dreaming of this and they dreaming
[38:36] of this and they dreaming of that.
[38:40] Praise the Lord. But there's no plan
[38:41] ATTACHED TO IT. GOD HAD THOUGHTS IN THE
[38:43] BACK PART OF HIS MIND. WE are thought in
[38:45] Christ the mystery of God revealed. But
[38:47] as long as it remain thoughts, nothing
[38:50] happened.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; There had to BE A PLAN ATTACHED TO GOD'S
[38:53] THOUGHTS. AND IT'S CALLED THE PLAN OF
[38:56] REDEMPTION.
[38:58] GOD THOUGHT ABOUT LIGHT.
[39:01] BUT AS LONG AS HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND
[39:02] DID NOTHING ABOUT IT, nothing happened.
[39:05] So you CAN HAVE GOOD THOUGHTS ALL YOU
[39:07] WANT. YOU CAN HAVE GOOD THOUGHTS, GOOD
[39:10] PLANS AND LEAVE it as a thought form.
[39:12] Nothing will happen. Nothing happened in
[39:14] Genesis until God stood there. The
[39:16] prophet says on that banister and he
[39:18] spoke and SAID LET THERE BE LIGHT.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[39:24] We are coming back to the time now the
[39:25] prophet says where the spoken word he
[39:28] calls it the original seed.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; The spoken word has been given back to
[39:33] us sons and daughters.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So don't let your
[39:38] thoughts your dreams be there just
[39:40] thoughts and dreams without a plan
[39:42] attached to it. Your thoughts will
[39:44] remain thoughts until it is spoken. Your
[39:46] words will remain unfulfilled until you
[39:48] believe your own words and don't doubt
[39:50] but believe that what you have said you
[39:52] shall receive it.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God also tells us that
[39:56] hope remains hope until faith brings it
[39:58] to reality.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; He says many people think they got faith
[40:01] but they really have his hope.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Hope is like a dream, a thought, a
[40:04] desire. Amen. You want that thing but he
[40:07] says faith goes into that unseen realm
[40:09] and pulls it into reality. That's right.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:16] Amen.
[40:18] So yeah, uh do we have the scripture for
[40:21] this? Amen.
[40:24] I think it's Ecclesiastes.
[40:27] Hallelujah.
[40:29] We'll find it now. Amen. But the Bible
[40:31] is talking about time and chance. What
[40:33] makes the person who is successful in
[40:35] Christ different from you or from the
[40:37] person that's not successful? Each one
[40:39] is given time 24 hours in a day.
[40:44] All of us are given the same. So we
[40:47] can't say that we are given an unfair
[40:49] advantage. I'm only given 12 hours in
[40:51] the day. That person is given 24 hours.
[40:53] All of us have 24 hours in a day.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; What are we doing with that 24 hours in
[40:59] a day? That is the difference. Amen.
[41:02] Praise the Lord.
[41:06] So the secret to that is managing. He
[41:10] says there's two things you can't change
[41:11] is time and change.
[41:16] Amen.
[41:18] We've got to manage change. We've got to
[41:20] plan for change. God plan for change.
[41:23] You can't go to God and say, "God, help
[41:25] me." God help me with his plan. Amen. Uh
[41:28] I need help. God's going to ask you with
[41:30] what do you need help? Uh I want money
[41:34] for what?
[41:38] I don't have time to read all of the
[41:39] quotes, but I'm just trying to go
[41:40] through this very quickly.
[41:41] [clears throat] The prophet of God says
[41:42] you want to be healed. Tell him why you
[41:44] want to be healed.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Tell him why you want to be healed. Why
[41:48] you want to be healed? You just want to
[41:49] carry on living your life, doing your
[41:51] own thing. Tell him why you want to be
[41:53] healed.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; You that read the message, you'll know
[41:57] what I'm talking about. Amen. You need
[42:00] money for what? Do you need money?
[42:03] Lord, lead me and guide me where?
[42:08] Where must he lead you?
[42:12] &gt;&gt; David was very specific. Lead me down
[42:14] paths of righteousness.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; We just pray prayers like, "Lord, won't
[42:18] you lead me and guide me?" Where where
[42:21] do you want to be led in paths of
[42:23] righteousness? In parts of holiness.
[42:26] Where do you want to be led? Be
[42:27] specific.
[42:29] If you give him no destination, Amen.
[42:32] You got no goal or no purpose in life.
[42:35] So, plan your time. Plan your days.
[42:38] Amen.
[42:40] Line your problems in the sight of God's
[42:42] word. You know, when you're firing a
[42:43] gun, you've got to line the sight. Take
[42:45] your problems and line it with the sight
[42:47] of God's word.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Line it with the sight of God's word.
[42:54] And when you get a clear shot, pull the
[42:56] trigger.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Pull the trigger on your problem based
[42:59] on God's word.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:02] So what will make you different from
[43:04] everyone else is you are able to manage
[43:06] time and change. When time and season
[43:10] change for Moses, God managed time and
[43:12] change. Amen. For the children of
[43:13] Israel, God sent Moses there. God had
[43:15] already planned for their deliverance.
[43:18] I told you God is a planner.
[43:21] When when the world was in going into
[43:24] chaos and God was displeased with man,
[43:26] God had time and God knew how to manage
[43:28] time and change. And he he had a plan
[43:31] for the ark.
[43:34] Praise the Lord.
[43:39] So plan with purpose because every plan
[43:41] must accomplish a purpose.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve fell in the garden of Eden,
[43:46] but God came immediately and presented a
[43:48] plan.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Let's move on now. So God, I'm going to
[43:57] reiterate this. God is a planner. We
[43:59] were created in his image. What is our
[44:01] plan?
[44:04] Don't waste time. You know, some of us
[44:05] only have one summer left.
[44:10] So, think of it this way. In
[44:12] [clears throat] the period of time,
[44:13] according to the Bible, it is appointed
[44:14] unto man three score and 10.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; That is how many years?
[44:19] &gt;&gt; 70 years. Which means you'll have 70
[44:20] summers, 70 winters, 70 autumns, and 70
[44:23] springs.
[44:26] Hello.
[44:29] So if we are to count down the amount of
[44:31] summers and springs, some of us have
[44:34] five springs left, five summers left,
[44:38] some of us have one summer left, some of
[44:41] us have one week left, some of us have
[44:44] one day left. We don't know. Nobody
[44:47] knows.
[44:48] Everyone's getting scared now.
[44:52] Maybe we got one more spring. We don't
[44:55] know.
[44:56] But have we made preparation?
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Have we planned? Have we accepted the
[45:01] Lord Jesus Christ? Do we believe on him?
[45:04] He says, "If you believe on me, you
[45:05] shall have everlasting life."
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:09] [clears throat]
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Another thing, don't waste time. Have an
[45:12] APPRECIATION FOR LIFE. GOD GAVE US this
[45:14] life.
[45:16] Some of us are so unhappy and upset that
[45:18] we are alive.
[45:23] You go around telling you, "I wish I was
[45:24] dead."
[45:26] How many of you heard people speak like
[45:28] that?
[45:29] &gt;&gt; They're so unappreciative of life. BUT
[45:33] GOD GAVE US HIS BREATH.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE US GOOD BODIES.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE US GOOD HEALTH. WE ARE TO ENJOY
[45:39] LIFE. WE ARE TO BE HAPPY ABOUT LIFE. WE
[45:42] SHOULD HAVE JOY IN OUR SOULS.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; HEY, come on now. You know, I want to
[45:48] say something, but you're going to get
[45:49] offended. Message people should not be
[45:51] miserable people.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; We should be happy.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; WE SAY WE HAVE THE MOST GLORIOUS
[45:56] MESSAGE.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; But we walking around with silent faces.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; How you expect other people to come
[46:02] accept your message when they see you
[46:03] got no joy.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; You can say I'm happy [clears throat]
[46:05] where I am. You look like you never had
[46:07] joy in your life.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; You got to make them thirsty.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Let me say it this way. Don't be a
[46:16] grouch. Yes.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Don't always complain.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Complain about everyone.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; You know, everyone you like, you know,
[46:28] people don't have encyclopedia anymore,
[46:30] but you're a walking encyclopedia.
[46:33] You ask him about this brother. Hey,
[46:34] suddenly he start ratting. Hey, like
[46:36] fire. What's that called that gun?
[46:39] &gt;&gt; AK-47.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Now, I told you we need to be one
[46:44] another's gatekeeper. Amen.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; When you hear your husband and your wife
[46:47] and your children talk like that, you
[46:49] need to tell them, "Come on, let's
[46:50] change our talk."
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Aren't we born again?
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Aren't we Holy Ghost filled?
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Why you carrying? Do you know out of the
[46:57] abundance of the heart, the mouth
[46:58] speaks?
[47:00] &gt;&gt; You know how they start? Hey bro, you
[47:01] know me, I got nothing against them,
[47:02] mate. But then they tell you all those
[47:03] things.
[47:06] Come on, am I talking?
[47:08] &gt;&gt; You know me, I got nothing. I don't hold
[47:10] nothing against anyone, bro. But now
[47:12] they start tell you all of these things.
[47:13] And then out of the abundance of the
[47:15] heart, the mouth speaks. So even though
[47:16] they are telling you they got nothing,
[47:18] the heart is telling everything.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Because if you're looking through the
[47:22] eyes of God, you can see them as
[47:23] sinless, as blameless, spotless, without
[47:25] wrinkle.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; I'll say amen to that.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; We don't HAVE A NEGATIVE GOSPEL.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT A POSITIVE GOSPEL.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise the Lord.
[47:38] Some people are never thankful, always
[47:39] anxious, always worrying, always
[47:41] sulking. Everyone was sto around there.
[47:48] Praise the Lord. Because your feelings
[47:49] get hurt. But Jesus feelings, he was
[47:52] despised and rejected of men.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We are not raising pot
[47:56] plant Christians here.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Hotb Christians.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So once in a while, God going to
[48:03] allow the brother to step on your toes
[48:05] &gt;&gt; to see what's inside.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; If you want orange juice, what you must
[48:09] do to the orange? Squeeze it.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; You must squeeze it.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; If I want to see what's inside of you,
[48:13] no matter what you profess with your
[48:15] mouth, let me step on your toes.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; And then I want to see. Let the beauty
[48:20] of Jesus be seen in me.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Sorry, brother. I'm sure you didn't mean
[48:29] to step on my toes, but it's okay.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; So, we're not raising
[48:40] What about people? Do they have a good
[48:41] testimony about us?
[48:44] What will our children say about us
[48:48] if they're not lying?
[48:51] What will our children say about us? If
[48:53] you're not married, what will your
[48:54] brother and sister say about you? If
[48:57] they're not covering up for your
[48:58] children cover up for their parents,
[48:59] will they have a good testimony to say,
[49:01] "No matter what my mother and father
[49:03] went through, no matter what my brother
[49:04] and sister went through, they never
[49:06] stopped serving the Lord." They were
[49:08] always faithful.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; No matter what sickness, what disease,
[49:12] what hardship, what struggles, they
[49:14] always put God first.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; THEY NEVER MISS CHURCH. THEY WERE
[49:18] FAITHFUL.
[49:20] But some people buckle under the
[49:21] slightest pressure.
[49:24] They give up victim mentality. How can
[49:27] we have victim mentality when we're
[49:28] supposed to be new creation?
[49:31] carrying baggage from the old man, old
[49:33] nature, living life in the kingdom of
[49:35] God with scars from the past. Amen.
[49:40] If we are new creation, he gives us a
[49:42] new nature.
[49:44] And that nature comes from the Holy
[49:46] Ghost. But people don't want the Holy
[49:47] Ghost. Amen. Let's read in Proverbs
[49:50] chapter 16 and verse 9. Amen. We're
[49:52] almost done now. We can try and wind
[49:54] this up.
[49:56] It says within your heart you can make
[49:57] plans for your future but the Lord
[50:00] chooses the steps you take to get there.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; I think this is just another translation
[50:07] but if you find the original translation
[50:09] you'll say a man makes plans in his
[50:10] heart but the Lord determines his steps
[50:12] he takes.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16:9. So this is just with your
[50:17] heart. You can make plans for your
[50:19] future but the Lord chooses the steps
[50:20] you take to get there.
[50:23] Amen. Even Romans 8:28 says, "We know
[50:26] that all things work together for good
[50:28] to them that love God, to them which are
[50:30] called according to his purpose." Now,
[50:32] can we plan for success? Let's see what
[50:33] the Lord told Joshua. Joshua 18, even as
[50:36] we try and wind down now, he says, "The
[50:38] book of the Lord shall not depart from
[50:39] your mouth. Thou shalt meditate there in
[50:42] day and night, that thou mayest observe
[50:44] to do according to all that is written
[50:45] therein, for then thou shalt make thy
[50:47] way prosperous, then thou shalt have
[50:49] good success." So, this is the key.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:54] Let's break it down. How to be
[50:55] prosperous and have a good success. Keep
[50:57] the word in your mouth according to the
[50:59] scripture. NOW, WHAT MUST WE DO? KEEP
[51:00] THE WORD in our mouth.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Let's get to the next part there. Amen.
[51:04] Next slide. Amen. The next one. Keep the
[51:09] word in your mouth. Next, he told
[51:10] Joshua, meditate on the word. To
[51:13] meditate means to be deliberate about
[51:14] it, to ponder upon it, think
[51:17] consistently on it. Do whatever the word
[51:20] says do. Amen. So to keep the word,
[51:24] meditate on the word, and do what the
[51:26] word says do. That's the recipe for good
[51:30] success.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; And James 1:22 says, "Be doers of the
[51:34] word,
[51:35] &gt;&gt; not hearers only." Praise the Lord.
[51:41] Now we can also cut ourselves from
[51:44] blessing by the way we treat people.
[51:45] Here the prophet of says they hated him
[51:47] without a cause because he was
[51:49] spiritual. Talking of Joseph now
[51:51] &gt;&gt; he was born as here. They had visions,
[51:53] dreams, interpret. He was more spiritual
[51:55] than the rest of his brothers. They
[51:57] hated him without a cause. They ought to
[51:59] have loved him more because the first
[52:02] that God was with him.
[52:05] You just do favor for those that God is
[52:08] with.
[52:10] Okay, let's read this properly now
[52:11] because this is the key I want to give
[52:12] you. He says, you just do favor for
[52:16] those that God is with and watch how you
[52:18] prosper.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Everyone hearing that? If you know that
[52:23] this is your brother and sister and he's
[52:25] walking with God, if you do them a
[52:27] favor, he says, "Watch how you prosper."
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; How many of you are reading that? You
[52:32] just do favor for those that God is with
[52:34] and watch how you prosper. God is always
[52:37] with his son Jesus Christ. You know
[52:40] that. So just do him favor and see how
[52:42] you prosper. Praise the Lord. This is
[52:45] the message the angel of the covenant.
[52:48] Amen. Preach 54031.
[52:51] Now is it in the Bible that you can
[52:53] prosper? Yes. 3 John 1 and 2. Amen.
[52:57] Beloved, I wish above all things that
[52:59] thou mayest prosper and be in good
[53:01] health, even as thy soul prosperth.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; So it's based on pro prosperity of the
[53:07] soul first.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; As your soul is prospering, I want you
[53:11] to prosper in all things and to be in
[53:13] good health. [crying]
[53:16] Now the prophet now hears, you know,
[53:18] some people believe they're meant to be
[53:19] sick.
[53:21] Do you hear people know maybe it's my
[53:22] lot, bro? You know, in this life to be
[53:24] sick, you know, maybe it's my lot in
[53:26] this life to be poor. Maybe it's my lot
[53:28] in this life. Hello.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Is anyone hearing me all sleeping now?
[53:33] &gt;&gt; I still got time here with you.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; I haven't clocked out yet. It's only 20
[53:39] 11. Praise the Lord. So pay attention.
[53:42] If you didn't sleep last night, take a
[53:43] deep breath. Get oxygen to your brain
[53:45] right now and let's close the service
[53:48] off.
[53:49] Some people believe it's their lot.
[53:54] Come on.
[53:57] Some people believe they made up their
[53:59] own story. This is meant for me. They
[54:02] told themselves that. But when you go to
[54:05] God's word, it's telling you something
[54:06] else. Amen.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Here the prophet says, "Now I've heard
[54:11] many people take that ARGUMENT AND SAY,
[54:13] "OH, IT'S SUCH A BLESSED THING TO BE
[54:15] SICK."
[54:19] &gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE SAY, "I'M SO BLESSED TO BE
[54:21] POOR."
[54:24] How can you be blessed to be poor? How
[54:26] can you be blessed to be sick?
[54:30] &gt;&gt; And we say we are children of Abraham.
[54:32] If if father Abraham was looking at you
[54:35] now, he say, "Hi, N boy. What happened
[54:37] to you? I was so blessed.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be after my royal
[54:43] seed.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Now you are 10 boy." Because you
[54:51] revelation 10 boy.
[54:58] Took a while with Josh. Okay.
[55:03] So some people are saying it's such a
[55:05] blessed THING TO BE SICK. GOD USES IT TO
[55:07] BLESS US. How can it be a bless and a
[55:10] cursing at the same time? Praise the
[55:13] Lord. Amen. One time in South Oh, got to
[55:16] be South Africa prophet.
[55:19] I wonder if that's you know spirits
[55:20] don't die. I wonder if this is a South
[55:22] African spirit.
[55:25] One time in South Africa we were having
[55:26] a meeting at the Dutch Reform Church. He
[55:28] stood up first papers blasted
[55:30] everywhere. But when they found out that
[55:32] their members became so spiritual when
[55:34] they went back they'd holler amen in
[55:36] church and everything they thought that
[55:38] then he got fanatical. So he went to
[55:41] church and he talked about such a
[55:42] blessing how the Lord blessed people
[55:44] with sickness and the man's wife a
[55:46] couple of late days later had
[55:48] appendicitis rushed to the hospital and
[55:50] cut that blessing out.
[55:54] So it was a blessing.
[55:57] But then now when it was
[55:58] life-threatening, they will cut the
[55:59] blessing out.
[56:01] Why? Yes. If it's such a blessing to be
[56:03] sick, let her go ahead and be sick.
[56:06] Don't do nothing about it. You'd be
[56:08] doing something God wouldn't want you to
[56:10] do. If it's such a blessing to have
[56:12] cancer, why take radium or radiation or
[56:16] anything? Just let it go ahead and be a
[56:18] blessing.
[56:19] How many of you feel it's a blessing?
[56:22] Anything
[56:26] negative is supposed to be counted with
[56:29] the word of God.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Look at all Jehovah's redemptive names.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; He takes care of everything.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; If you're sick is Rafa.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; If you need provision is Gyra.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; The redemptive blessings are there, but
[56:42] we are the ones saying no, it's not
[56:43] meant for me.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; We are the ones saying it's not meant
[56:47] for me. [clears throat]
[56:48] If we are troubled in our mind, you
[56:51] know, life circumstances can really
[56:52] weigh on us sometimes and it can come
[56:55] back to us memory and it can come. But
[56:58] we need shalom.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; We need peace.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; So is JEHOVAH SHALOM. THAT'S PART OF THE
[57:02] REDEMPTIVE BLESSING.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you're more blessed
[57:08] when you're dead, hear what the prophet
[57:10] says. Now, IF YOU'RE MORE BLESSED WHEN
[57:12] YOU'RE DEAD, AND YOU CAN DO NO more for
[57:14] the Lord when you're dead than when
[57:15] you're alive, well, go ahead and die.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Let me give them the message because
[57:23] people going to say, I wrote this in the
[57:25] hand of the Lord came upon him 54043.
[57:30] So in other words, the prophet is saying
[57:31] is if you are no good alive and you're
[57:34] making everyone's life a misery and you
[57:36] yourself are not happy with your own
[57:38] life, he said then you might as well not
[57:40] go die because you are not fulfilling
[57:41] any purpose on the earth. Let's read
[57:43] that again. Some people can't believe
[57:45] the prophet said they must die. If
[57:46] you're more blessed when you're dead
[57:51] and [clears throat] you can do more for
[57:52] the Lord when you're dead than when
[57:54] you're alive, well go ahead and die.
[58:03] I can't believe the prophet said this,
[58:04] but anyway, let's move on.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's miss the next one. And he's
[58:12] trying to force his way into you.
[58:14] Everything he can. Ask abundantly that
[58:16] your joys might be full. He wants his
[58:18] people to BE HAPPY.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; ASKING GREAT THINGS, BELIEVING for great
[58:22] things.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; You know me, bro, I like to be unhappy.
[58:27] He He He wants HIS PEOPLE TO BE HAPPY
[58:30] ASKING FOR GREAT THINGS, believing for
[58:32] great things.
[58:34] That's thou son of David, have mercy on
[58:36] me. Amen.
[58:38] You know what? Some people in vain do
[58:40] they worship him. Yeah, that's Mark 7:7,
[58:43] right? In vain they are sick.
[58:47] They thinking they're sick for the Lord.
[58:49] In vain you are sick.
[58:52] Some people are poor for nothing. in
[58:55] vain you are poor. You're just lazy.
[58:59] Hello.
[59:01] Go read Ecclesiastes.
[59:04] He says if you don't do something,
[59:06] you're not going to get prosperous. You
[59:08] need to put your hands to work. When God
[59:09] created man, he said he must work.
[59:11] Before God gave man a wife, he planted
[59:13] the garden and said work in the garden
[59:14] first. Hello.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; I'm just checking if you're alive.
[59:19] That's why I'm saying hello.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's miss the next one
[59:24] and go to the next one in why the
[59:26] message why we're closing now. It's
[59:28] 11:23 now. You know what to do.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; How many of you know what to do?
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It's 11:23.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; If you believe in your heart, don't
[59:36] doubt,
[59:37] &gt;&gt; but believe that what you have spoken
[59:39] shall come to pass. You shall have what
[59:41] you said. You were made to be happy and
[59:43] free.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; You were made to live like children
[59:45] before your father and know that he
[59:47] makes every day everything work right
[59:50] for you each day. The people are just
[59:52] afraid of the new birth. This is what I
[59:53] keep saying. People hate the Holy Ghost.
[59:55] They're afraid to come to it because
[59:56] it'll straighten them up.
[1:00:00] It'll make you quit playing bingo,
[1:00:02] playing slot machines. Now, people don't
[1:00:04] have bingo and slot machine. They got
[1:00:05] their cell phone in their room and they
[1:00:07] they're gambling there.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; They're betting on soccer,
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; sports betting, this that they're
[1:00:15] getting poor in their room.
[1:00:21] Yeah, before your parents said don't go
[1:00:22] out. Now in their not going out in their
[1:00:25] room and they're getting poor.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Your parents should tell it before.
[1:00:28] Don't go out and join bad company. Now
[1:00:30] in the room they're joining bad company.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Don't go out and mess with women. Now in
[1:00:36] the room they're messing with women.
[1:00:38] Pornographic material.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Are we talking truth?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; It's 21st century. We got to talk truth.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. People afraid that if it'll make
[1:00:52] you quit playing bingo, quit playing
[1:00:53] these slot machines. Praise the Lord.
[1:00:56] It'll make you quit staying at home on
[1:00:58] Wednesday night from prayer meeting to
[1:00:59] watch we love Suzie and all those other
[1:01:02] crazy things that Hollywood has got.
[1:01:04] Them dirty jokes that cracked over and
[1:01:06] it'll make you let your hair grow out
[1:01:08] long. It'll make you act like a lady.
[1:01:10] Make you quit smoking cigarettes
[1:01:13] than being in church as deacon. See,
[1:01:16] instead of doing that, rather be a
[1:01:17] deacon in the church.
[1:01:20] It'll make you quit lying, stealing.
[1:01:21] It'll do something for you. It'll clean
[1:01:23] you up, give you salvation that there's
[1:01:25] nothing in the world can explain it away
[1:01:27] from you cuz you know you were there
[1:01:30] when it happened.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And if you notice,
[1:01:34] listen to this very carefully now. When
[1:01:37] you get discouraged, that's when the
[1:01:38] devil can really pour it on you.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Don't get discouraged, people. Be
[1:01:43] encouraged in the Lord.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; When you get discouraged, that's when
[1:01:46] THE DEVIL CAN REALLY POUR it on you.
[1:01:48] That's when he gets you. If you can come
[1:01:50] to church and say, "Well, I don't know.
[1:01:52] I don't know whether I'll ever get
[1:01:53] better or not. I've been prayed for
[1:01:55] twice. Oh my. You might as well go
[1:01:57] home." See, the prophet finished saying
[1:01:58] he was going to die. Now he's saying he
[1:01:59] must go home.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; You might as well go home. That's all.
[1:02:05] But when you can cast that aside, God
[1:02:07] don't want you to be frowning.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; So God planned for you to be healed.
[1:02:12] Yes.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; God planned for you to prosper in this
[1:02:14] life.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; God has planned for it.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; We've got to align to God's plan.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; As Gyra, he has planned for it. As Rafa,
[1:02:23] he has planned for it.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; God wants you to be happy. THE HUMAN
[1:02:28] HEART WAS MADE TO BE HAPPY.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Worry will cause cancer.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Tempo will cause cancer.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Don't never be upset. JUST WALK IN HIS
[1:02:38] LOVE.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; And when you're walking in him, nothing
[1:02:40] can harm you. There's nothing can harm
[1:02:42] you. Neither powers, present, things,
[1:02:44] future can separate us from him. Amen.
[1:02:47] Praise the Lord. We're chosen and
[1:02:49] elected in him. So, what kind of a power
[1:02:52] have you got over you to take care of
[1:02:55] you? You see, we have a power. I'm
[1:02:58] walking in power,
[1:03:00] working miracles, and live a life of
[1:03:03] favor. I know who I am.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; He says, "What power have you got? The
[1:03:10] old powers that created the universe
[1:03:13] that took the solar system blew it like
[1:03:15] that every star went into place. Isaiah
[1:03:17] 54:17 says, "No weapon formed against
[1:03:20] thee shall prosper."
[1:03:22] Amen.
[1:03:23] And every time that shall rise against
[1:03:25] thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn.
[1:03:29] There's nothing they there's really
[1:03:31] nothing you can say against them, but
[1:03:33] they're just alert, watching, seeing
[1:03:35] what's going on and watching. So he's
[1:03:37] talking about now how every country is
[1:03:40] watching one another and they'll slip
[1:03:42] into the one another's country and see
[1:03:43] what weapons you got. Right? So we
[1:03:46] already know I'm climaxing with this. We
[1:03:49] why I've got this quote here. They spy
[1:03:52] on one another to know what weaponry
[1:03:53] they have to uncover one another's
[1:03:56] defense weapons. Christ came now to open
[1:03:59] the seals to uncover Satan's tactics and
[1:04:02] his schemes. That's why the seals were
[1:04:04] open to make us victorious over the
[1:04:07] enemy so that we won't be deceived.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; So he he opened the seals to uncover the
[1:04:13] right of deception.
[1:04:18] Be like Daniel. [clears throat]
[1:04:21] Daniel burnt all the bridges behind it.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; When they say don't pray, you pray.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; You know, Daniel could have prayed
[1:04:28] without opening the curtains.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:04:32] But he wanted them to see that he was
[1:04:33] not afraid.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; So he says he wasn't planning on going
[1:04:38] back. So he burnt the bridges.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Some of you don't want to burn bridges
[1:04:44] with the devil.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; You're telling me this thing here in the
[1:04:47] church, don't walk out. Wait, I'm coming
[1:04:49] back.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; You tell everyone in the bar, hey, keep
[1:04:52] my stool here. I'm coming back.
[1:04:55] No. Burn your bridges.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Daniel didn't care if he burnt his
[1:04:59] bridges. He wasn't planning on going
[1:05:01] back. Why? He had a plan. He wasn't
[1:05:03] planning on going back. He wasn't
[1:05:05] watching his back trail, forsaking those
[1:05:08] things which are in the past. He pressed
[1:05:09] forward.
[1:05:11] Amen. Hear now. Have a plan. The prophet
[1:05:14] says when you're getting married, have a
[1:05:15] plan.
[1:05:17] Don't just go get married to anyone. He
[1:05:19] says a believer should never marry an
[1:05:20] unbeliever.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; It's a serious thing when you choose a
[1:05:25] wife for a man for the vows until death
[1:05:28] do we part. That's how we should keep
[1:05:30] it. And you take a vow before God that
[1:05:32] only death will separate you. A man in
[1:05:35] his right mind that's planning a future.
[1:05:40] What we must do? Plan. Don't go fall in
[1:05:42] love.
[1:05:44] Hello.
[1:05:49] Planning a future.
[1:05:52] You should choose a wife very carefully.
[1:05:54] Be careful what you're doing. And a
[1:05:56] woman choosing a husband or accepting
[1:05:58] the choice of a husband should be really
[1:06:00] careful what she's doing. Especially in
[1:06:03] these days, a man should think, pray
[1:06:06] before he chooses a wife.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; What you must do? Think.
[1:06:13] Now, when you're in love, nobody can
[1:06:15] think for you. You think you know
[1:06:17] everything. Hello. Don't look down now.
[1:06:20] Come on. Walk with me. I'm helping you
[1:06:22] here.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; You must think. You must pray. Don't
[1:06:27] only look.
[1:06:29] You know, you know I can look in your
[1:06:30] eyes forever. So you must close your
[1:06:32] eyes and pray.
[1:06:35] The prophet must pray.
[1:06:38] You know out of your eyes are the stars
[1:06:40] coming out. Your neck is like a swan.
[1:06:44] Start quoting Solomon to
[1:06:46] praise the Lord.
[1:06:53] Think. Pray before he chooses a wife. So
[1:06:57] many divorce cases now that we leave the
[1:07:00] world in America. Divorce cases we leave
[1:07:02] the rest of the world. There's more
[1:07:03] divorces here than anywhere else. This
[1:07:05] nation supposed to be thought of a
[1:07:06] Christian nation. What a reproach. Our
[1:07:08] divorce courses. Reason of it because
[1:07:11] that men has got away from God and woman
[1:07:13] has got away from God. And we find if a
[1:07:16] man prayed and a woman prayed over the
[1:07:17] matter, not just look at a pretty set of
[1:07:20] eyes, big strong shoulders, some worldly
[1:07:22] affection, but would look God first and
[1:07:25] say, "God, is that your plan?"
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Planning is an attribute of God.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Is that your plan?
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, in Proverbs 4:23
[1:07:43] it says,
[1:07:45] "Amen." Let's get to Proverbs. Let's
[1:07:48] read the next one there.
[1:07:51] Keep thy heart with all diligence for
[1:07:54] out of it are the issues of life. All
[1:07:57] your problems are coming because of
[1:07:58] what's in your heart.
[1:08:00] You got scarred, you got memories,
[1:08:03] everything that's in your heart. He's
[1:08:04] saying out of it is the issues of life.
[1:08:06] Amen.
[1:08:11] Let's uh let's go to the next one and
[1:08:13] see what the prophet is saying here. Now
[1:08:14] I'm closing with this. I promise you in
[1:08:16] the next couple of minutes I'll be done.
[1:08:20] Prophet is discerning somebody now and
[1:08:21] he says I'm I'm trying to show you
[1:08:23] something how these things are the
[1:08:24] issues of life coming from the heart.
[1:08:26] He's discerning this person and he says
[1:08:29] he knowed you since you were born but I
[1:08:31] see you're suffering with a tremendous
[1:08:32] nervous condition. one of those types
[1:08:35] that hurt you. Makes you think deep.
[1:08:37] Always planning things, you never get to
[1:08:39] them. See, so you're planning things,
[1:08:40] you never get to them. [clears throat]
[1:08:42] Amen. It never happens that way. Always
[1:08:44] crossing bridges before you get them.
[1:08:47] Taking other people's worries. He says,
[1:08:49] "You believe?
[1:08:52] Would you do what I told you to?" Now,
[1:08:54] standing here all your life, you've been
[1:08:56] nervous,
[1:08:58] right? You have a nervous person. You're
[1:09:00] not a nervous person that shakes. So, we
[1:09:03] can't see physically looking at you, we
[1:09:04] can't see that you're nervous.
[1:09:07] You're a nervous person by thinking.
[1:09:10] You're always pre-planning things, going
[1:09:13] ahead, planning things ahead. Usually
[1:09:16] never happens that way. We call it
[1:09:17] crossing bridges before you get to them.
[1:09:20] In doing that, you formed a stomach
[1:09:22] trouble.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Now, remember, this is a prophet
[1:09:26] discerning it.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Spirits don't die,
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; right? nervous person thinking troubled
[1:09:33] he says your form it's stomach trouble
[1:09:35] it's an ulcer in your stomach it's
[1:09:37] nervousness you quit being nervous
[1:09:39] there's no need of being nervous Jesus
[1:09:41] is with you go on your road rejoicing
[1:09:44] thanking God and praising him you'll get
[1:09:46] completely well in the name of Jesus
[1:09:47] Christ
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:09:52] let's get to the next one if you want
[1:09:54] something to happen you'll have to take
[1:09:56] my word for it if I'm planning on doing
[1:09:58] something I know better than to tell
[1:10:00] anyone about it. Amen. So, don't tell
[1:10:02] your plans to Satan. Satan will hear it.
[1:10:06] Amen.
[1:10:09] I think I'm done. I just want to say
[1:10:11] this in summary that God's perfect plan
[1:10:13] for us in this time in the 21st century
[1:10:15] now is the message of the hour.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; This is God's perfect plan.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; The seals are open so that we can
[1:10:22] succeed and prosper against the enemy.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; There's no lack in the message of the
[1:10:26] hour. This is a blessed land flowing
[1:10:28] with milk and honey. After seven church
[1:10:31] ages, God led us to this land of our
[1:10:33] inheritance. A land of joy, a land of
[1:10:35] love, a land of the Holy Ghost with
[1:10:37] living bread of life to sustain us in
[1:10:38] this journey. This is our part. The
[1:10:41] rapture, the shout message, living bread
[1:10:43] of life. Let's stand together. Give him
[1:10:46] praise. [applause]
[1:10:49] Hallelujah.
[1:10:50] Amen. God has a plan for our lives.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Let's live it with purpose. We don't
[1:10:55] know if the Lord will call us home
[1:10:56] today. We don't know if the Lord will
[1:10:58] call us home tomorrow. We don't know if
[1:11:00] we have one summer left, two summers
[1:11:02] left. We don't know our time and season.
[1:11:05] But let's live it to our full potential.
[1:11:09] Let's live it to according to God's
[1:11:11] plan.
[1:11:13] Hallelujah.
[1:11:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:18] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:11:22] God's plan for your life is a glorious
[1:11:24] plan.
[1:11:26] Amen. So if you're sick, I want you to
[1:11:28] align with God's word. His word says by
[1:11:30] his stripes you were healed.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; If you're in lack, God's word says, "I'm
[1:11:35] Jehovah Gyro, your provider."
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; If you if you are in trouble, God says,
[1:11:40] "I'm Jehovah Shalom. I am your peace."
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you are being led astray, God
[1:11:46] says, [music] "I am your shepherd. I'll
[1:11:48] lead you.
[1:11:50] These are the redemptive blessings of
[1:11:52] God.
[1:11:55] Let's plan for success. Meditate on the
[1:11:58] word. Keep the word in your mouth and do
[1:12:00] the word.
[1:12:02] [music] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:05] Oh, he's worthy to be praised. Worthy of
[1:12:08] honor.
[1:12:09] Amen.
[1:12:11] We just want to worship him and give him
[1:12:13] praise now.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; And say, "Father, if I misaligned from
[1:12:16] your plan, realign me to your plan."
[1:12:19] Amen.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We haven't come just to listen to
[1:12:22] a sermon. The spirit is trying to speak
[1:12:24] to you, to tell you, follow God's plan
[1:12:26] for your life. Your own plan might lead
[1:12:29] you down destructive pathways, [music]
[1:12:31] but God has a plan for your life. Choose
[1:12:34] God. Choose his plan. Choose his
[1:12:36] purpose.
[1:12:39] Why don't you want to flourish in his
[1:12:40] presence? [music]
[1:12:43] You're going to dry up. You know, the
[1:12:44] prophet of God says this, when you when
[1:12:47] you're burning coal and you got all the
[1:12:49] coal together,
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; it stays hot, stays on fire.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; He says, but you take a coal out of
[1:12:54] there and you place it one side.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Watch how it gets cold.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; It gets formal, it starts to die out.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Send a new touch of
[1:13:06] fire [music and singing]
[1:13:07] in my soul,
[1:13:09] Lord. Send it now,
[1:13:12] Lord.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Say
[1:13:17] touch.
[1:13:19] [music]
[1:13:26] Touch your [music] fire in my soul.
[1:13:30] Send you touch. [music]
[1:13:33] Touch your fire in my soul. [music]
[1:13:38] Lord, send it out.
[1:13:43] Say, [music and singing]
[1:13:44] "Touch my lips. Touch my lips to
[1:13:51] [music]
[1:13:52] [singing]
[1:13:55] touch my life in my soul. Send you touch
[1:14:02] [music]
[1:14:04] my send your holy fire.
[1:14:08] [music]
[1:14:13] Touch my lips.
[1:14:18] [music]
[1:14:19] Touch him with a [singing] burning.
[1:14:24] Touch your fire in my soul. [music]
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:31] Oh [singing]
[1:14:33] to Jesus
[1:14:36] I surrender [music]
[1:14:39] and humble
[1:14:42] at [singing]
[1:14:43] his [music] feet
[1:14:45] I bow
[1:14:48] and worldly [music]
[1:14:50] [singing]
[1:14:50] pleasures
[1:14:52] all forsake [music]
[1:14:55] and take [singing]
[1:14:58] Jesus Just take [music]
[1:15:02] me. I surrender. [singing]
[1:15:06] Surrender.
[1:15:08] [music]
[1:15:13] I
[1:15:14] surrender
[1:15:16] [singing and music] all
[1:15:19] to thee. All
[1:15:22] to thee. [music]
[1:15:24] My
[1:15:26] savior.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; I surrender
[1:15:32] all.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Is that your prayer this [singing]
[1:15:36] morning?
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; To surrender every path.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; gone down paths, unfamiliar pathways.
[1:15:44] [music]
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've gone down [singing] the
[1:15:46] Broadway.
