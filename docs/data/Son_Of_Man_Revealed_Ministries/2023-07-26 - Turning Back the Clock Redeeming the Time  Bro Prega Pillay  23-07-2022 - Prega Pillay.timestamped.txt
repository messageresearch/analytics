[8:06] to do
[8:07] amen so I believe the Lord has been
[8:09] using our brother tremendously amen I
[8:11] heard about a testimony and maybe our
[8:13] brother the prayer will share about a
[8:14] testimony of a sister that got healed in

[8:20] brother was instrumental in that
[8:22] testimony the crippled sister
[8:24] yeah maybe see you can see it's all live

[25:38] if you could use the weakness of Moses
[25:42] the impediment and the embarrassment of
[25:45] Moses
[25:46] to speak the third pool into existence
[25:51] surely Lord we are needy this morning
[25:55] that the great author of this word could

[26:55] how do I turn back the clock turning
[26:58] back the clock and my subject is
[26:59] Redeeming the time amen can somebody say
[27:02] amen amen we live in a we live from day
[27:05] to day with our stories of Grace yes and
[27:08] each one of us have got an amazing story
[27:10] of Grace amen and a journey of Grace
[27:14] that is so unique
[27:15] and it's so rich and it's so beautiful
[27:19] that you you can't really compare your
[27:22] story to somebody else yes amen but what
[27:24] you do know is that the amazing grace of
[27:26] God that Reckless Love of God that
[27:30] lavish love of God the prodigal story to
[27:33] me is not about really The Prodigal Son
[27:35] that was in lavishness it was the
[27:38] father's lavishness of his love amen and
[27:41] his prodigal you know Reckless love that
[27:43] the father displayed to his son and I
[27:46] believe in every one of our lives that
[27:48] love of God has constrained itself and
[27:51] the love of God has expressed itself yes
[27:53] in such beautiful ways that you could
[27:55] have died sometime amen you could have
[27:57] been so lost yes amen but God came down
[28:02] and he picked you up from the deep
[28:05] Marine clay amen and Samuel's mom Anna
[28:09] says it took me out of the dung Hill yes
[28:12] and he set me among princes and that's
[28:14] why we could never be boastful about
[28:16] anything else but
[28:18] about the love of God yes amen because
[28:21] it's so unique and so special and so
[28:24] beautiful for each one of you that will
[28:27] open up your hearts and they enjoy and
[28:29] and and and experience is love in a
[28:32] special way and when you have that kind
[28:34] of attitude of gratitude towards God and
[28:37] Thanksgiving in your heart for what he's
[28:40] done for you the real truth is you can't
[28:42] judge no one but yourself amen
[28:44] with anybody else but measure your own
[28:48] self against yourself amen amen and when
[28:51] you do that there can't be envy and
[28:53] jealousy and strife in you because the
[28:55] love of God covers a multitude amen and
[28:58] the Beautiful uh amazing goodness of God
[29:01] as our brother wanted about the the
[29:03] testimony I was speaking about God you
[29:07] know in this Bollywood movies and and
[29:09] all of that that you watch they like to
[29:11] use acronyms so I I they're in a village
[29:14] called panga uh where we took two trains
[29:18] to get to that Village Village in
[29:19] November of last year and the real
[29:23] poverty-stricken place and and when I
[29:25] got there the pastor came with this
[29:26] tactics and collected us he drives one
[29:29] of those little tactics so and my voice
[29:32] was all gone uh by that by that time it
[29:34] was uh because of the climate and so on
[29:37] so they gave me some nice hot chai tea
[29:39] uh you know and put lemongrass in there
[29:42] and so on and and really relieved my
[29:45] throat so when I got to the pulpit there
[29:47] was enough Voice Hallelujah and the
[29:50] people were all sitting on the floor
[29:51] sayings not so lovely like the way you
[29:54] are or you know it's so comfortable with
[29:56] air conditioning and all of that they
[29:58] were just sitting on the floor and right
[30:00] to the back and and so on and uh so I
[30:03] spoke on God grace of divine amen
[30:07] hallelujah and just just enjoy the
[30:09] presence of the Lord this bathing over
[30:11] the people and I got lost in in the in
[30:14] in the preaching and it probably went to
[30:17] about an hour 30 minutes or something
[30:18] and then uh the people were just on fire
[30:21] since amen our own Indian Community yeah
[30:24] me this was like colored Pentecostals
[30:27] amen that that was just wrecked with the
[30:29] with the presence of the Lord because
[30:31] they in poverty where there's a
[30:34] bankruptcy of wealth and where there's
[30:36] poverty the fake banking is very high
[30:38] amen hallelujah and signs and wonders
[30:42] follow the word of God in those kind of
[30:45] times but because we live too soft and
[30:48] we live to convenient don't
[30:50] inconvenience me Hallelujah don't come
[30:52] with your attitude towards me amen I
[30:55] know if we have that kind of attitude
[30:57] amen God can't move in our life but
[30:59] these people are desperate yeah and they
[31:01] extremely
[31:02] dead and Reviving The Message desperate
[31:05] respiration creates love amen he says if
[31:08] you want to be you want to have the love
[31:10] of God God makes you desperate another
[31:13] place he says if you want to have Grace
[31:15] then express love for When Love projects
[31:18] Sovereign Grace takes over so it's there
[31:22] and then just and then at the end of the
[31:23] service the anointing was so tangible
[31:26] Hallelujah I didn't realize what I was
[31:28] saying amen and I said bring me though
[31:31] most hardest case
[31:33] that you have it definitely was not me
[31:36] because I did do something like that
[31:38] Hallelujah I said bring me the hardest
[31:41] case that you have amen and then
[31:44] suddenly the the crowd just moved and I
[31:46] see a bit right at the back and I see a
[31:49] lady laying there you know sleeping
[31:51] Their Eyes Are Open she was hearing the
[31:53] word of God and the pastor comes and
[31:55] takes a little bit of oil it has a
[31:58] bottle of oil and he takes me there
[32:00] because I said give me your other steps
[32:02] hallelujah praise the Lord and then we
[32:05] go to her amen and then I remember
[32:07] telling the people I needed to protect
[32:10] myself now and I said it was the faith
[32:13] of the four friends
[32:15] Hallelujah that took the man on a planet
[32:18] and they took him and they opened the
[32:20] Capstone of the roof yes amen and lay
[32:23] because there was no place to enter and
[32:25] they laid him amen down and they opened
[32:28] up the Capstone open up the Capstone of
[32:30] Charity and amen and the lady the palate
[32:32] where Jesus was was standing but Jesus

[33:54] there there was a riot in the church
[33:56] [Music]
[33:58] people were getting healed all over but
[34:01] I remember Pastor Adrian that I said to
[34:03] them close your eyes

[34:09] young sister amen there was over 30
[34:11] years old she had did not close eyes and

[34:36] odd minutes we went down to our laid
[34:38] hands and the paralytic devil left the
[34:41] sister so what am I trying to tell you

[36:15] was the testimony that it's Bible days
[36:18] again Hallelujah
[36:21] thinking amen I was busy thinking and
[36:24] and one message that I ministered of
[36:26] later at Pastor pursani was Caleb Caleb
[36:30] the Giant Slayer I was busy with that on
[36:33] in Hebron and a lovely wonderful you
[36:36] know how the Caleb Ministries the
[36:38] bride's Ministry amen and Caleb how he
[36:40] slayed those giants in Hebron and let an
[36:43] anointing fell on David amen because
[36:46] David was actually anointed in Hebron
[36:48] amen and Mac Palace cave wasn't everyone
[36:52] where the resurrection took place and
[36:54] all those wonderful things so I was
[36:56] thinking on that until the Lord
[36:57] interrupted my thoughts and wrote this
[37:00] message of turning back the clock and
[37:03] why because when I was speaking to this
[37:05] young man there was a heavy cigarette of
[37:08] regrets
[37:09] and disappointment and sadness that I
[37:13] could feel was coming from this young
[37:14] wonderful young man he's also a musician
[37:16] in the Pentecostal church amen and I
[37:20] tell you what and the Lord said and the
[37:22] Lord put upon my heart to tell you this
[37:23] morning that this message and this
[37:26] glorious presence of the Shekinah Glory
[37:29] has come to turn back the clock amen yes
[37:33] in each and every one of your lives from
[37:37] time to Eternity amen while you're
[37:40] living in a body of time amen and as the
[37:43] Holy Spirit from the outward expression
[37:45] of time amen and living from day to day
[37:48] and evening to morning becoming the
[37:50] first day etc etc when the Holy Spirit
[37:53] is baptizes you we thank God for
[37:56] Josephine that's going to be water
[37:58] baptized amen and she's being water
[38:01] baptized just by being identified with
[38:04] the church amen and outward expression
[38:06] of an inward book of Grace but on the
[38:08] baptism of the Holy Spirit amen comes
[38:11] into you Hallelujah when the spirit of
[38:14] God the Zoe life of God comes and takes
[38:16] his habitation in your throne room of
[38:19] your heart Hallelujah and circumcising
[38:22] your heart amen now you are you are you
[38:25] are you are invited now you are part of
[38:29] the mystical Body of Christ you're not
[38:31] part of the amen of the Angelic
[38:34] citizenship amen of Heaven Can somebody
[38:36] say Amen you're no more and it's
[38:39] parallel you're in this world but not of
[38:41] this world you're living in a body of
[38:43] time but eternity dwells inside of you
[38:46] and The Eternity is not about a Sunday
[38:49] morning or a Wednesday at night time
[38:51] that eternity is a 24 7 in everything
[38:55] give thanks actually you come to this
[38:58] understanding that whether it is death
[39:00] whether is grateful or it doesn't matter
[39:02] how bad things are all things are good
[39:05] because all things put
[39:08] [Music]
[39:12] s put hold according to his
[39:14] purpose amen then you realize doesn't
[39:17] matter whether my heart is broken
[39:19] doesn't matter how bad things may be or
[39:22] how good things may be it's all good
[39:24] amen because the Eternal preacher inside
[39:27] of you amen overrides your natural
[39:32] thinking it overrides your natural
[39:34] behavior that people cannot understand
[39:37] you yes yes your family can't understand
[39:40] you there's a Joseph anointing that is
[39:43] upon your life whether you will like it

[39:51] don't see wisdom they will see
[39:53] understanding they'll see an expression
[39:56] of Eternity why you've come to realize
[40:00] you're just a tourist amen
[40:02] you've got to realize when eternity
[40:05] comes inside of you your application

[40:10] approved because you said I believe amen
[40:14] hallelujah you said I receive

[40:28] seven Thunders become cliche Seven Seals
[40:31] are just nice semantics they're nice
