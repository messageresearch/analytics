[2:36] Thanksgiving amen amen amen I greet you
[2:39] all in the precious name of our Lord and
[2:41] Savior Jesus Christ amen amen Our God
[2:44] and King who is worthy to be praised
[2:46] amen hallelujah amen for he is the king
[2:49] of kings and he's the Lord of lords amen
[2:52] amen and this king is no longer
[2:57] single right yes this King is a married
[3:00] King yes amen amen hallelujah amen when
[3:04] he came to the Earth about 2,000 years
[3:07] ago he came looking for his bride amen
[3:12] and he was put to sleep on the
[3:14] cross and a spear went into his side to
[3:18] release that hidden portion of himself
[3:22] amen hallelujah amen and then you know
[3:25] in Revelation 5 Revelation 5 the prophet
[3:28] of God tells us that he comes out of the
[3:30] sanctuary looking for his Queen amen
[3:34] looking for those names in the book am
[3:36] amen so we just love the Lord we can
[3:38] keep talking about that amen so I greet
[3:40] you all in the mighty name of our Lord
[3:41] and Savior Jesus Christ amen greet our
[3:43] brother Moses amen our sister Rachel
[3:46] parents of brother Joshua and brother
[3:47] Jeff we welcome you pray be blessed amen
[3:49] God bless you brother Barnabas amen pray
[3:52] be blessed in the house of the Lord amen
[3:54] any other visitors here we are no we're
[3:56] not really visitors we're not strangers
[3:59] amen we are just pilgrims amen
[4:01] sojourners so we welcome you in the name
[4:03] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so let's
[4:06] go to our Bibles we'll go to Revelation
[4:09] 10: 11 I want to get one portion of
[4:11] scripture
[4:13] there
[4:15] amen for a little thought amen I want to
[4:18] speak on the Bright's Jubilee trumpet in
[4:20] the days of our
[4:22] prophecy amen amen the Bright's Jubilee
[4:25] trumpet in the days of our prophecy am
[4:28] amen
[4:30] so let's read Revelation
[4:34] 10:1 and he said unto
[4:36] me thou must prophesy again before many
[4:40] peoples and Nations and tongues and
[4:45] Kings amen so the last portion of the
[4:49] ministry is given to John who's a type
[4:51] of the Bride yes that's how the Gentile
[4:54] dispensation ends so we can't be happy
[4:57] coming into the message just happy and
[5:00] content just receiving the word amen
[5:03] here John is asked to release the word
[5:05] that he has received amen there was the
[5:09] eating part but it ends with
[5:12] releasing you are what you eat so the
[5:15] commission is thou must prophesy again
[5:18] before many peoples Nations tongues and
[5:22] Kings if you read Revelation chap 13 and
[5:25] Revelation 17 you'll see that people
[5:27] Nations tongues and kings are being hell
[5:28] captured by the Beast
[5:31] so that's why the prophetic word has to
[5:32] be released because who has the names in
[5:34] the book Revelation 5 the book had names
[5:38] yes the book comes down in Revelation 10
[5:41] so the one who has the book now it's
[5:44] consumed the bright as the Revelation
[5:47] amen of what he once done with the word
[5:50] and she must now call the rest of the
[5:51] names in the book that's our prophecy
[5:54] amen the Lord had blessings to the
[5:56] reading of his word you may be seated I
[5:57] want to get to Luke 4 and: 16 I want to
[6:00] show you amen what our lord Jesus did
[6:04] praise the
[6:07] Lord amen because the prophet teaches us
[6:11] clearly that everything that Jesus did
[6:13] his bridled be the same amen bone of his
[6:16] bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his
[6:19] Spirit he even tells us that your
[6:21] ministry will be a greater portion a
[6:23] double portion when he's talking about
[6:26] the bride amen so yeah in uh
[6:31] Amen in in Luke 4:16 and he came to
[6:36] Nazareth where he had been brought up
[6:40] and as his custom was he went into the
[6:41] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[6:44] up for to read so we also come to church
[6:46] on a Sunday and we also stand for the
[6:48] reading of the word amen praise the Lord
[6:51] and notice it was his
[6:53] custom so don't come to church when you
[6:56] please amen if the Lord Jesus made it
[6:58] his custom to go to church church amen
[7:00] it ought to be our custom as well and
[7:02] there was delivered unto him the book
[7:05] now we just showed you in Revelation 10
[7:06] John is delivered a book amen and there
[7:09] was delivered unto him the book of the
[7:12] prophet Isaiah and when he had opened
[7:14] the book he found the place where it was
[7:17] written and the Lord Jesus does this he
[7:19] says the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[7:22] now can you imagine the room all the
[7:24] scribes the Pharisees he entered now the
[7:26] temple they hand Jesus the book
[7:30] All Eyes Are Fixed On Jesus they know
[7:33] he's The Miracle
[7:34] Worker they know this man amen is
[7:37] working the
[7:38] miraculous so when he goes to the
[7:40] scripture what scripture will he go to
[7:42] he's got the room riveted All Eyes Are
[7:45] Fixed On Jesus amen and he reads the
[7:48] scripture the spirit of the Lord is upon
[7:50] me and he reads it with such
[7:53] Authority amen because he had anointed
[7:56] me to preach the gospel to the poor amen
[7:59] he had send me to heal the
[8:01] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[8:03] the captives and the recovering of sight
[8:06] to the
[8:07] blind Amen to set at Liberty them that
[8:10] are bruised to preach the acceptable
[8:14] hear of the Lord amen now the prophecy
[8:18] continues but Jesus stops Midway of the
[8:21] prophecy amen and he says and he closed
[8:24] the
[8:25] book and he gave it again to the
[8:27] minister and sat down
[8:30] and all the eyes of them that were in
[8:31] the synagogue were fastened on
[8:33] him they were amazed that this man spoke
[8:38] with authority and can you imagine the
[8:40] conversations in the room he read that
[8:43] scripture like it was about
[8:47] him and he read it with such Authority
[8:50] that it became a reality it it almost
[8:52] felt like that scripture was meant for
[8:56] him remember in that room now Faith come
[8:59] by the hearing so all eyes are fastened
[9:01] on
[9:03] Jesus he reads it with such Authority
[9:05] that he brings the scripture to life
[9:08] asai wrote about this time when he would
[9:11] take that
[9:12] book and then some of the scribes and
[9:15] some of the Pharisees started a rumor
[9:18] and listen he says and they began to say
[9:21] unto him this day oh sorry he says this
[9:23] day the scriptures fulfilled and all be
[9:25] witness and wondered at the gracious
[9:27] Words which proceeded out of his
[9:29] mouth and then comes the unbelief is not
[9:33] this Joseph's
[9:35] son they shook themselves oh yes what
[9:38] were we
[9:39] thinking we almost thought that was a
[9:43] messiah but you see when a word he sown
[9:46] listen to that verse before that they
[9:48] listen to the gracious words that
[9:50] proceeded out of his
[9:54] mouth but then Devil comes to S unbelief
[9:58] it's not this Joseph
[10:00] son amen praise the Lord amen so my
[10:03] point there when you read Isaiah 60 if
[10:05] you can put up Isaiah 60 Jesus stops
[10:08] Midway because there's a portion of
[10:11] ministry left for an end time people
[10:13] amen that starts with a prophetic gift
[10:16] amen amen but son of man doesn't stop in
[10:19] a
[10:20] prophet son of man continues all the way
[10:23] in a people amen when Christ is revealed
[10:26] in his word to a people that his son of
[10:28] man minister be continuing we'll read
[10:30] the quote just now amen but I want to
[10:32] show you in Isaiah 60:1 Jesus stops at
[10:35] verse two Midway you find that he
[10:40] says
[10:43] amen sorry 61
[10:46] 612 he stops Midway to proclaim the
[10:49] acceptable of the Lord but it continues
[10:52] and the day of the Vengeance of our
[10:56] God that day of vengeance is happening
[10:59] in Revelation 10 because Revelation 10
[11:03] Christ is not descending the mighty
[11:04] Angel is not descending to come for a
[11:06] picnic that's right the battle is hot
[11:08] and heavy amen the beast on the earth
[11:12] Beast coming from the land Beast coming
[11:14] from the sea therefore the mighty Angel
[11:17] descends and he puts one foot on the
[11:18] land one foot on the sea he's coming in
[11:20] a time of War amen when all hell is let
[11:23] loose upon the Earth read the the fourth
[11:26] seal all hell is following this Rider
[11:28] called death 200 million demons have
[11:31] been let loose upon the Earth amen but
[11:33] the mighty Angel
[11:35] descends right with a
[11:37] shout amen amen he's coming to bring a
[11:41] protection over God's people because
[11:43] they must receive the word amen
[11:45] hallelujah so here you find the day of
[11:48] Vengeance of God is happening in
[11:50] Revelation 10 it's a time of
[11:51] investigating judgment it's like genesis
[11:54] 18 there amen it's a time of
[11:57] investigating judgment because the cross
[11:59] is gone up to God and man's heart is
[12:01] continually
[12:03] evil amen
[12:05] hallelujah so you find here to comfort
[12:08] all that mourn that Ministry is for Son
[12:10] of Man when he comes back to the Earth
[12:12] that's in operation now this is the
[12:15] bridal Ministry to comfort all that
[12:18] mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in
[12:21] Zion and to give unto them Beauty for
[12:24] Ashes Hallelujah the oil of joy for
[12:28] mourning amen the Garment of Praise for
[12:30] the spirit of heaviness that they might
[12:32] be called the Trees of Righteousness the
[12:34] planting of the Lord that he might be
[12:37] glorified but where is she getting this
[12:39] oil where is she getting this wine to
[12:41] give
[12:42] off amen amen can you see her
[12:47] Ministry she's bringing beautiful ashes
[12:51] it's not her doing it it's Christ in her
[12:54] amen you read Colossians 3 amen
[12:56] hallelujah you find amen it's not no
[12:59] longer I I died in Christ Christ now

[13:08] live amen by the faith of the Son of God
[13:10] so they have oil of joy for mourning

[15:12] the old Earth is Mount
[15:15] Zion on the sides of the north the city

[17:08] how excited brother Brandon gets when
[17:10] you listen to that message and he starts
[17:11] to talk about stimulation of Revelation
[17:14] and the Holy Ghost being poured out but
[17:16] it is not being poured out sparingly to
[17:17] the Bride of Jesus Christ it is being
[17:20] poured out in an overflow it's in an
[17:22] abundance amen because as much as you

[18:50] the Lord your God and none else and my
[18:52] people shall never be ashamed amen this
[18:54] is a quote I was telling you about amen
[18:56] read it carefully now because this is a
[18:58] portion of your ministry he says then
[19:00] Jesus says As it was in the days of
[19:02] Sodom now watch close in the days of
[19:04] Sodom so will it be in the coming of the
[19:06] son of man when the son of man is being
[19:10] revealed not no more as a church not no
[19:14] more the bride is called
[19:17] yes in the days of the son of man will
[19:20] be revealed what to join the church to
[19:23] the Head
[19:26] amen the marriage of the Bride right the
[19:29] bridegroom call will come right through
[19:32] this amen amen when the son of man will
[19:35] come down and come in human flesh to
[19:37] unite the two together
[19:41] amen Lord but does it stop there the
[19:44] bridegroom call came through the
[19:46] prophetic
[19:48] gift don't stop there though he goes on
[19:52] the church has to be the word come on
[19:55] now he's not saying the church has to
[19:56] receive the word he's not saying the
[19:59] church has to hear the word he's saying
[20:00] the church has to be the word amen we
[20:04] are not just satisfied listening to the
[20:06] word we want to manifest all that the
[20:08] word says about us we must take the book
[20:11] and find where it is written of us amen
[20:14] praise the Lord amen praise the Lord
[20:18] amen the church has to be the word he is
[20:21] the word and the two unite together so
[20:24] it can only be word uniting with word
[20:27] the only way that you can be a part the
[20:29] Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ if you
[20:30] were in the predestinated thoughts of
[20:32] God Amen if you came from the sight of
[20:34] the Lord Jesus Christ and if you did I
[20:36] how about we give him a good of Praise
[20:38] how come amen we can't shout how come we
[20:41] can't dance how come we can't Rejoice
[20:43] about those things amen and don't let me
[20:46] try and crank you up to give God praise
[20:48] amen you are to be rejoicing in the
[20:50] house of the Lord because of What the
[20:51] Lord Has
[20:53] Done amen it seems like when things are
[20:55] given too easy and you receive things
[20:58] tooo easy you have nothing to shout
[21:00] about you need to check your experience

[25:28] come down in human flesh Among Us and
[25:30] will make his word so real that he will
[25:32] unite the church and him as one the
[25:34] bride then she'll go home to the wedding

[25:42] the wedding supper not the marriage but
[25:45] the Rapture is going to be is going to
[25:47] the waiting supper when the word year
[25:49] unites with the
[25:51] person when the two become one I'm so

[27:19] the word in the church becomes one
[27:20] whatever the son of man done whatever
[27:23] Jesus did he was the word the church

[28:08] that praise the Lord everybody feeling
[28:11] good we're speaking this morning amen
[28:14] just to remind you on the bride's
[28:16] Jubilee trumpet in the days of our
[28:17] prophecy
[28:20] amen now you know it's Jubilee trumpet
[28:22] is to set the captives free amen we just
[28:25] read amen the second part of Isaiah 61
[28:28] there what our ministry entails and then
[28:30] we showed you how we got the oil and the
[28:32] wine and the Overflow in Joel chapter
[28:34] 2 We are following a train of thought
[28:37] amen amen praise the Lord and then we
[28:39] were showing our Lord Jesus Christ how
[28:41] he operated amen and the son of man
[28:43] being revealed in us again hallelujah
[28:45] praise the Lord so Leviticus chapter
[28:48] 25 and verse 8 praise the
[28:56] Lord says here
[28:59] and thou shal number seven sabbaths of
[29:01] years unto thee seven times seven years
[29:03] and the space of seven sabbaths of years
[29:05] shall be unto thee 40 and9 years then
[29:08] shall thou cause the trumpet of Jubilee
[29:10] to sound on the 10th day of the seventh
[29:13] month amen yes Lord amen that is not
[29:17] there by
[29:18] chance you cause it a sound on the 10th
[29:21] day of the seventh month amen you can
[29:23] put up Revelation 10:7 there hallelujah
[29:26] hallelujah while we on this point you'll
[29:28] see the prophet is coming in Revelation
[29:31] 10:7 yes but in the days of the voice of
[29:34] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[29:37] sound it's a jubilee trumpet being
[29:39] sounded the mystery of God should be
[29:42] finished as he had declared to his
[29:44] servants the prophets amen praise the
[29:47] Lord amen amen we can go back Leviticus
[29:53] 25:8 amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[29:58] [Music]
[30:00] amen then there shall th cause the
[30:03] trumpet of Jubilee to sound on the 10th
[30:04] day of the seventh month in the day of
[30:06] atonement shall he make the trumpet
[30:08] sound throughout all your
[30:10] land to All Nations tribes tongues
[30:14] Kings and you shall hallow the 50th year
[30:16] and Proclaim Liberty throughout all your
[30:18] land and to all inhabitants therefore it
[30:21] shall be a jubilee unto you and you
[30:23] shall return every man unto his
[30:26] possession and you shall return every
[30:28] man unto his
[30:31] family a jubilee shall that 50th year be
[30:35] unto you you shall not sow neither reap
[30:38] that which growth of itself in it
[30:40] neither gather the grapes in it of thy
[30:42] Vine undressed you see in the 50th year
[30:45] it's a land of abundance and Jubilee so
[30:47] sister venessa should be looking forward
[30:49] to the 50th year amen because it's a
[30:51] land of increase where God Is providing
[30:53] in abundance and
[30:56] overflow thank you Lord
[30:58] amen because when when trumpet is s
[31:01] remember the guy was a slave he's got
[31:04] nothing to go to so who must
[31:08] provide God must
[31:12] provide he's not being building up
[31:14] wealth all these years he was imprisoned
[31:16] he was he lost his possession but in the
[31:18] 50th year when the trumpet of Jubilee
[31:20] sounds amen he can go free back to his
[31:22] possession meaning there is a provision
[31:24] made for him
[31:28] praise the
[31:29] Lord
[31:31] amen for it shall be a
[31:34] jubilee and it shall be holy unto you
[31:36] you shall eat in the increase thereof
[31:38] out of the field you see the provision
[31:40] is there in the year of this Jubilee you
[31:42] shall return every man unto his
[31:43] possession and if Thou shalt sell ought
[31:45] to Thy Neighbor or buyest or of thy
[31:48] neighbor's hand you shall not oppress
[31:49] one another according to the number of
[31:52] years after the Jubilee Thou shalt buy
[31:54] of thy neighbor and according unto the
[31:56] number of years of the fruit he shall
[31:58] sell unto thee praise the
[32:03] Lord so I want you to know as well
[32:05] there's a another side to that story if
[32:08] a man refuses to hear the trumpet yes
[32:14] yes yes amen if he refuses to hear the
[32:17] proclamation of
[32:20] emancipation he must be taken to the
[32:22] temple you know we read that scripture
[32:23] the last
[32:26] time the man must be taken that's right
[32:30] now remember when they rejected Jesus
[32:34] ministry what year did Peter strike of
[32:36] the I PRI
[32:39] servant
[32:42] sorry left
[32:44] here struck his right here
[32:48] why Jesus ministry had been rejected so
[32:52] they rejected the sounding of Jubilee
[32:55] trumpet so the year must be
[32:59] not praise the Lord
[33:02] amen so if the bride is having a
[33:05] prophetic
[33:07] Ministry the Bible says take him in a
[33:09] public
[33:12] place take him to the door
[33:16] yes take him to the door yes and let let
[33:21] all be pushed through his
[33:24] ear so if Jesus ministry was was was
[33:27] rejected and the I PRI servants here
[33:30] were struck when the bride's Ministry is
[33:34] rejected take the
[33:36] man to Butler
[33:38] Pennsylvania a butler is the one who
[33:40] answers the door take him to the
[33:44] door amen we've been through this
[33:46] message before as soon as it happened
[33:48] amen the Holy Spirit picked it up he
[33:49] brought it to the church amen Trump was
[33:52] marked in the air not the woman the man
[33:54] was marked in the air why the brides
[33:57] sign that the bride's message has been
[34:02] rejected and after the rejection now
[34:05] comes the judgments of God amen amen
[34:09] take the man and Mark him in the
[34:12] air praise the Lord but that's for
[34:15] whosoever will
[34:16] believe praise the
[34:20] Lord so we know that F year is a jubilee
[34:24] the word Pentecost means
[34:26] Jubilee Praise the Lord he says that the
[34:28] going forth of the Jubilee sounded
[34:30] throughout all the lands a trumpet was
[34:32] to sound and the trumpet would make the
[34:35] distinction so a trumpet has to make a
[34:37] distinct sound yes amen amen I didn't
[34:41] respond when or Roberts was preaching I
[34:43] didn't respond when Billy Graham was
[34:45] preaching I didn't respond when a Helen
[34:47] was preaching but when William grham
[34:50] started to blow his trumpet something in
[34:52] my soul responded to that
[34:56] word amen amen and I keep listening for
[35:00] a different sound
[35:02] am oh yeah why he had the call of the
[35:05] bridegroom we just read the quote the
[35:07] bridegroom's call will come by the
[35:10] prophet
[35:15] Hallelujah can't you hear your theophany
[35:19] calling you amen I didn't respond to any
[35:21] TG Jakes amen amen amen I didn't respond
[35:25] to Joel o Ste I didn't respond Amen to
[35:29] Joseph amen what's his name the grace
[35:31] Minister Prince Joseph Prince amen but I
[35:36] responded Amen to a prophetic gift huah
[35:39] an unparallel gift even now they are
[35:42] mesmerized by the gift even as recent as
[35:46] amen you'll find even weekly clips are
[35:48] going by how they study the life and
[35:50] Ministry and they see this ministry is
[35:52] unparalleled because it wasn't a human
[35:54] Ministry it was a son of man being
[35:56] revealed amen that's right praise the
[36:00] Lord hallelujah it was no ordinary
[36:04] Ministry and we showed you how they
[36:06] marveled at William bram's Faith but
[36:08] they didn't know there was a driving
[36:10] force behind that faith it was love
[36:13] producing the faith he says every time I
[36:15] was on the platform and before any
[36:17] healing there was a great presence and
[36:19] the Holy Spirit came over me that great
[36:22] love
[36:25] Spirit now if it operated in him how
[36:28] many of you know it must operate in
[36:30] you oh I'm not just saying that randomly
[36:33] Hallelujah the great love Spirit has to
[36:35] come amongst
[36:37] us praise the Lord put up love spirit
[36:40] amen as a perfect match there love
[36:43] Spirit watch now what we've been
[36:45] building up for months and years now is
[36:47] going to culminate in this
[36:50] amen amen while we here I want to show
[36:53] you this amen that this is what the
[36:55] bride is contending for yes sir
[37:00] amen it should be just one day if you
[37:03] got a love spirit amen don't put it as a
[37:05] white search just put it as exact
[37:07] search praise the
[37:09] Lord I wasn't going to bring this today
[37:12] but amen if the spirit is bringing it
[37:13] out we want to get it
[37:15] amen amen you've got four tell me what
[37:19] it
[37:21] is I can't hear
[37:25] you the next one I'll find it for you
[37:30] now amen how if you love the Lord amen
[37:33] amen I want to show you that brother
[37:35] Bram says his love Spirit came over him
[37:38] and I want to show you he's prophesying
[37:39] it over a
[37:40] people and when this happens it's it's
[37:44] not going to be the efforts of any
[37:48] man this is what we actually contending
[37:50] for and waiting for
[37:55] amen praise the Lord
[37:58] [Music]
[38:02] God keeps his
[38:04] word amen now that's the message but he
[38:08] does keep his word listen to what he
[38:11] says here go
[38:14] up right he says I believe it's coming
[38:18] to a time where
[38:29] let's just go from from 215 I want to
[38:32] want you to get this wheel good it don't
[38:34] matter if we don't finish a service
[38:35] today amen let's just get certain
[38:38] things let's crystallize certain points
[38:41] 215 want to tell you what happens this
[38:44] last week we've had some of the most
[38:46] marvelous things happen in the meeting
[38:47] CU at the platform and I have coming
[38:50] into type of something you see I'm
[38:52] coming into a type of
[38:54] something that it just seems to be
[38:56] greater than than what it was hey I want
[38:59] that I have come to the platform and God
[39:02] has given a gift a prophetic gift that's
[39:04] beyond question I can prove it to you
[39:06] right here that's beyond question but I
[39:09] see just doesn't get the job done the
[39:11] way it should oh interesting I love this
[39:15] because the prophet is teaching me how
[39:17] to
[39:23] operate because it's just a gift see the
[39:27] prophet is going to tell us now he's
[39:28] going to go this thing is going to be
[39:29] something past a gift
[39:32] right another thing it's an individual
[39:35] you see it pertains to an individual
[39:37] through a gift but I done something the
[39:39] other day tried to get the people in
[39:40] Oakland just to wear in a big arena just
[39:43] his presence and just stayed right with
[39:45] that word and got the people you know
[39:47] what there was more healing than I
[39:49] believe I've ever seen in anyone meeting
[39:51] taking place outside of the big meetings
[39:53] like in Africa and around like that but
[39:55] for its size the people people just
[39:58] recognizing the presence of
[40:00] God you see why we can't sit in the
[40:02] service and his presence go
[40:04] unrecognized we are not interested in
[40:06] the service we don't say an amen in fact
[40:09] some of us are almost 40 years and we've
[40:10] never said an
[40:13] amen the people recognizing the presence
[40:16] of God in the meeting just sitting there
[40:18] getting in the presence of God and the
[40:20] people would get up healed crosseyed
[40:25] straightened now here what he says I
[40:28] believe it's coming to a time where Paul
[40:30] said where there's prophecies it shall
[40:32] fail he's in 1 Corinthians 13 now have
[40:36] we been dealing with 1 Corinthians
[40:38] 13 where there tongues they shall cease
[40:42] I believe it's coming to a time till
[40:44] when the saints will get together like
[40:47] this and just a love
[40:49] spirit will sweep over the
[40:52] audience what will happen then brother
[40:54] Brandon and just every person in there
[40:57] all that's wrong will be taken out it'll
[40:59] be such a presence of the Holy Spirit I
[41:02] believe while we've to lay hands on them
[41:04] and pray for them now it's a contact
[41:07] maybe of a minister anointed and laying
[41:09] hands on just a blessing to God but I
[41:12] believe it's coming a time when God's
[41:14] church is going to be so called out like
[41:16] that where the Saints will sit together
[41:18] and the Holy Spirit will just come in
[41:20] just woo just like it was on the day of
[41:22] Pentecost and just heal the people and
[41:25] raise up the people great things I begin
[41:28] to see it happen and if you are looking
[41:31] for that and if you are contending for
[41:33] that where the Holy Spirit swis through
[41:35] the
[41:36] place Lord you're not looking up to a
[41:39] man you're not looking to the gift but
[41:41] you recognize who you
[41:44] are because I tell you why men has went
[41:47] forth with gifts that's true I have no
[41:49] doubt to say I'm not being a Critic of
[41:51] anyone what they believe that's up to
[41:53] them I've seen men with gifted
[41:55] Ministries they went forth more or less
[41:56] but what would would I say with respects
[41:58] and with love God knows it's from my
[42:00] heart they have made more like a money
[42:03] Gathering
[42:04] Affair out of it you see just get the
[42:06] people together put them in a big
[42:08] something money
[42:11] out praise the
[42:13] Lord so just so you know as your pastor
[42:17] that's what I'm preaching you to oh
[42:19] thank you Lord that's the faith we are
[42:20] building too where you can receive the
[42:23] Holy Ghost sweep through the building
[42:25] that's why you got to be reverent
[42:27] Hallelujah in a service Hallelujah
[42:30] because you can distract the Holy
[42:32] Spirit Hallelujah you can even miss it
[42:35] the prophet of God will say woman I saw
[42:37] the light over your head there and then
[42:39] stop again and say oh he's gone you
[42:41] missed it yes sir why irreverence unable
[42:45] to recognize the presence of God am when
[42:48] it is being manifest amen hallelujah
[42:51] praise the
[42:52] Lord so we were talking about amen this
[42:56] great Jubilee Ministry that the bride
[42:58] has a Ministry to set the captives free
[43:01] a Ministry amen of oil and wine who did
[43:05] the foolish virgins go to to look for
[43:07] oil amen but it was the ministry of the
[43:10] Bride to tell I can't give it to
[43:13] you amen this is not an
[43:17] impartation the Holy Ghost can't come in
[43:20] in this measure and in this form where I
[43:22] have oil in my lamp and I have oil in my
[43:24] vessel it came with a price it came with
[43:28] a consecration it came amen with too
[43:30] much amen that I had to sacrifice in
[43:32] this life I can't just give it to you
[43:35] you've got to go to them that sell
[43:38] it it's also a
[43:41] journey a walk a Enoch
[43:45] walk hallelujah amen this shouldn't just
[43:48] come overnight sir you are trying to
[43:51] dispossess me of my oil but I can't give
[43:54] it to
[43:55] you you've got to protect the oil amen
[43:58] the ministry of love is not just one
[44:01] that gives without knowing what he wants
[44:03] done with the
[44:04] word she knows what he wants done with
[44:06] the word and she knows what she can give
[44:09] and what she can't give yes
[44:13] yes it's a Ministry of love it's a
[44:16] prophetic Ministry but she can't give it
[44:18] go read Matthew
[44:20] 25 she can't give it that's right you
[44:24] have to go yourself
[44:28] and go and seek the angel of the Lord go
[44:30] and seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:33] you know what it
[44:35] works because they came back with oil
[44:38] and they came looking for the ones that
[44:40] had oil but they got it too
[44:48] late so when people are preaching that
[44:50] the Holy Ghost is cut off they're not
[44:51] talking the
[44:52] truth that's right the Holy Ghost was
[44:55] poured out right until the time the
[44:58] bride was taken off the Earth that's
[45:00] what the prophet says says when the hly
[45:02] when the bride leaves the Holy Ghost
[45:03] goes because it must go to the Jews
[45:06] praise the
[45:07] Lord so my plea to you is you can still
[45:11] get the Holy Ghost but don't get it too
[45:14] late
[45:16] amen amen praise the
[45:20] Lord so when I'm talking about a
[45:23] distinction 107 was a distinct sound
[45:27] 10 7 was
[45:30] [Music]
[45:31] unmissable and can I say this 107 is
[45:35] [Music]
[45:36] Unstoppable you can't stop it no matter
[45:40] how many critics rise how many dating
[45:42] and chors Rise God will have children
[45:45] God will raise up children that will
[45:47] believe that
[45:49] message praise the
[45:51] Lord amen he says here in the message
[45:54] isza Jubilee the devil has got our
[45:56] church all cold formal indifferent what
[45:58] we need is a calling back what we need
[46:00] is an oldfashioned Gathering Together

[46:04] forth of the Holy Ghost outcoming of the
[46:07] spirit that calls us to come back to

[46:31] you don't get sealed by God the devil
[46:33] will seal your ear the prophet here in
[46:34] the mark of the beast he says but you
[46:36] reject the truth and the devil seals
[46:38] your
[46:39] ear and if your ear is sealed you don't
[46:42] hear it
[46:43] anymore meaning you'll be you'll be
[46:45] hearing people telling
[46:48] you
[46:51] things but you can't hear
[46:54] them you know that sometimes what
[46:56] happens
[46:57] you know when the husband is talking to
[46:58] the wife and her mind is preoccupied I'm
[47:00] not saying it the other way because a
[47:01] men will get in trouble I'm saying it
[47:03] the other
[47:05] way you know and the and the okay the
[47:08] men are guilty of this I'm say it that
[47:10] way when the wife is talking to the man
[47:11] but the mind is man is thinking
[47:13] something else and he's he can hear a
[47:15] voice coming through but it's like a far
[47:18] distance he's thinking something else

[48:31] negative about brother brandham and he
[48:33] says Fred Roberts came up after that and
[48:35] corrected the

[51:22] the voice of Martha and she came you see
[51:24] sometimes you won't always hear the
[51:26] voice of Jesus sometimes it will come in
[51:28] the form of
[51:29] Martha sir sometimes it will come in the
[51:32] form of your brother and sister but to
[51:34] reject their voice is to reject Jesus

[52:19] amen you you find there amen Ela
[52:22] sounding Jubilee trumpet
[52:26] to
[52:28] Rebecca telling her things she never
[52:30] heard before telling her about a man she
[52:33] never heard before telling about Abraham
[52:36] telling about Isaac telling about all
[52:38] the goods she never seen that country
[52:40] before she never seen that that that
[52:43] kind of people before but something in
[52:45] her heart responded to Jubilee trumpet
[52:48] call
[52:50] hallelujah amen remember the bride makes
[52:52] herself
[52:54] ready there's a portion for the bride to
[52:56] do you can't be sitting in your house
[53:00] and doing nothing and saying I'm making
[53:01] myself ready no that's not making
[53:03] yourself
[53:06] ready making yourself ready you go find
[53:10] them
[53:12] Rebecca
[53:14] fulfills an Unwritten part of the
[53:16] scripture she knew nothing
[53:19] about because El are told when I ask for
[53:23] a drink she must give me a drink that's
[53:27] the only part that will be spoken you
[53:29] won't ask her to feed the camels
[53:31] Wednesday we speaking about Waters and
[53:33] Waters of
[53:35] Separation amen you'll see she goes to
[53:39] taking water and the prophet says that
[53:42] Beast represents a power the power that
[53:45] was going to pack her back to Isaac she
[53:47] was feeding it with water washed By the
[53:49] Waters of the word she was feeding it
[53:51] back with the word back with the word
[53:53] giving it strength because amen any any
[53:56] supernatural being can only be fed with
[53:58] the word so she had to feed the beast
[54:01] back the Waters of the word Waters of
[54:03] the word Waters of the
[54:04] word then you find amen she's making
[54:07] herself ready and when they ask her will
[54:10] you go with this man she must make a
[54:13] decision the family can't make the
[54:15] decision for you your mother father
[54:17] can't make the decision for
[54:20] you yes amen you've got to make the
[54:23] decision for yourself and to respond to
[54:26] Jubilee
[54:27] trumpet she said I will go then even
[54:31] when she goes on the journey she doesn't
[54:34] go unguided El is with her every step of
[54:36] the way when she sees him in the field
[54:40] she asks Ela because the bride under a
[54:44] messenger amen who is that man in the
[54:46] field is he the one we've got to know
[54:49] who we are uniting with because Satan
[54:51] can come as an angel of Light but we've
[54:53] got to know the scriptural
[54:54] identification of how he will reveal
[54:56] himself otherwise you'll find yourself
[54:58] in some
[55:01] denomination he told us how Christ is
[55:03] being revealed he told us where he
[55:05] chosen place of worship is he had
[55:08] clearly marked out and identified his
[55:10] place where he put his
[55:12] name so that we won't be confused Who's
[55:15] Isaac connect with
[55:17] Isaac and then you find she still makes
[55:20] herself ready she takes a veil and
[55:22] covers herself and goes towards Isaac
[55:25] amen I believe that's the portion where
[55:27] the bride is now she's
[55:29] veiled gone into with Isaac into the
[55:32] tent into Sarah's tent amen and there
[55:36] she became his wife praise the
[55:39] Lord amen you had to finish off now amen
[55:44] Rea was trapped in Jericho without a
[55:46] future and a hope you know I love things
[55:49] about children of God they learn they
[55:51] don't make the same mistakes twice you
[55:54] see when Moses first sent spies he sent
[55:55] 10 spies how many spies he
[55:58] sent 10 spies was it 10 or was it 12 was
[56:04] it 10 10
[56:06] spies
[56:08] right you don't they don't make the same
[56:11] mistake
[56:12] again second time they send spies how
[56:14] many they
[56:15] send two tell your neighbor learn from
[56:18] your
[56:21] mistakes the first time you took
[56:23] unbelievers with you second time don't
[56:24] take unbelievers
[56:26] [Music]
[56:28] amen yes if you make the same mistake
[56:31] twice you to
[56:32] blame because the other guys said
[56:34] there's Giants in the land we're not
[56:36] evil so Joshua a type of the Holy Ghost
[56:39] learns hey send
[56:40] true send Faith and
[56:44] love let them give RAB
[56:47] Hope come on give God a good an of
[56:52] Praise amen and six days they hear the
[56:57] trumpet sound once on the seventh day
[56:59] she's hearing the trumpet sound and the
[57:02] walls come down and re goes free because
[57:05] she responds to the
[57:08] trumpets Mori sounded the trumpet for
[57:10] Esther she was she was Queen in a
[57:13] position but she wasn't able to function
[57:15] as Queen you see you can be in the
[57:17] message and not functioning as bride not
[57:20] functioning as wife you in the palace
[57:24] but got no access to the king
[57:27] yes sir and if you watch how the story
[57:28] is portrayed Modi is not able to have
[57:30] direct communication with Esther he's
[57:33] like in another place he's like in
[57:35] another dimension like our Prophet is
[57:37] now in another dimension but there is
[57:39] one can go forth his name is ACH atch is
[57:42] the one the fivefold ministry that is
[57:45] now having communication with Esther so
[57:47] it's between atch and Esther that
[57:50] messages are going P between these
[57:54] two Hallelujah amen that's why the
[57:57] fivefold ministry must be faithful
[57:59] Faithfully taught to say only what the
[58:01] prophet
[58:02] says amen because passing important
[58:04] message to the queen praise the Lord so
[58:07] my point is you can be in the kingdom
[58:10] and be shut off from the presence of the
[58:13] king no
[58:15] access no
[58:20] relationship and living like that saying
[58:23] I'm in fear of the king because if he
[58:25] said if anyone comes into the presence
[58:27] Uninvited can be
[58:30] killed but the word straightens
[58:32] [Music]
[58:34] outu the word of Mori stens are
[58:37] out don't think your life will be
[58:41] spared don't think you're automatically
[58:43] going to make the
[58:48] Rapture who knows you
[58:50] were kept aside for such a time as
[58:53] this who knows you were called for such
[58:56] a time as this a prophetic Ministry of
[58:59] Love producing the faith
[59:01] substance of things
[59:04] hopeful amen the bride has a Ministry
[59:07] Revelation 10:11 is our ministry we
[59:10] can't be idle with that
[59:12] Ministry if you watch what Esther did
[59:14] after
[59:15] that once she gets into the presence of
[59:17] the king once a royal scepter is raised
[59:19] to her and once she's given to even to
[59:21] after the kingdom this woman goes to
[59:24] work making herself ready starts to
[59:26] organize a feast and starts to command
[59:28] the king and uh his
[59:31] name amen come to the feast they all
[59:34] start dancing to her
[59:36] tune she becomes a final Authority there
[59:39] oh come on now listen she becomes a
[59:41] final Authority she makes a feast she
[59:43] calls them summons the king amen summons

[59:52] certain date yes sir they're going to
[59:55] kill all the Jews
[59:56] [Music]
[59:59] but Esther starts to she gets the king
[1:00:01] Signet she gets his seal the king gives
[1:00:04] it to them and modah and they start to
[1:00:07] rewrite the
[1:00:09] lawen this bride shall write another
[1:00:11] book of
[1:00:12] Acts this bride shall
[1:00:15] rewrite everything that the devil has
[1:00:17] planned for you there's God's plans and
[1:00:19] the devil's plans you've got to rewrite
[1:00:21] your
[1:00:24] plan stops today
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:27] Esther had to
[1:00:28] rewrite on a certain certain date they
[1:00:32] were going to come against this Northern
[1:00:33] Army was going to come against them and
[1:00:35] kill all the Jews but Esther rewrote the
[1:00:39] law the king said what I have written I
[1:00:41] have written I can't change
[1:00:43] it but you you see the king put it back
[1:00:46] in her hand the king couldn't change his
[1:00:49] own word the King has now put the book
[1:00:52] in your hand amen if you read Revelation
