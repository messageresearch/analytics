[0:00] Amen.
[0:08] Everyone in the mighty powerful name of
[0:10] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Rachel brothers and sisters say
[0:14] you're welcome into the house of the
[0:15] Lord.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; Everybody feeling good.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Romesh is not sure. He's
[0:25] in Johannesburg. He left on Friday and
[0:28] he'll be coming back on witness day.
[0:30] Amen. He's going to spend some time with
[0:32] his children. So we pray that the Lord
[0:33] will bless him. Amen. And give him a
[0:35] good time there. Amen. Was your neighbor
[0:39] well?
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ask Turn to them and ask them
[0:44] where were you on Wednesday?
[0:49] What did they tell you?
[0:54] Tell them I expect to see you here on
[0:55] Wednesday.
[0:57] Amen. We need to hold one another
[0:59] accountable. Praise the Lord. Everyone
[1:02] feeling good? Amen. Let's turn to our
[1:04] Bibles even as we go into our scripture
[1:06] this morning and our our message this
[1:09] morning. We've been speaking on crowning
[1:11] our ministry as adopted sons of God.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; If you remember, we took divine nature.
[1:16] We took divine character. This morning,
[1:19] we look at divine power.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; G. Amen. Because nature comes from the
[1:23] seed gene that God placed within us.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; And once we allow the Holy Spirit to
[1:28] germinate that seed gene to life, the
[1:30] nature of God comes on display.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; And out of the nature comes character.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; I will uh review some of the character
[1:38] this morning just to background a bit to
[1:41] show you that character you can't pray
[1:43] for character.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; Character is not a gift. It can't be
[1:46] given to you.
[1:48] Character is developed through your
[1:49] daily experiences.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says character is a
[1:54] victory.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; Now he says when we have divine
[1:57] character then the power that's locked
[2:00] up within us by the Holy Ghost
[2:04] &gt;&gt; can now be utilized and your foot to
[2:06] rule
[2:07] &gt;&gt; rule with that power
[2:08] &gt;&gt; in God's kingdom. Amen. Let's turn to
[2:11] our Bibles. We'll go to second Peter
[2:13] chapter uh one.
[2:15] Praise the Lord.
[2:27] Let's read from
[2:29] verse three. According as his divine
[2:32] power, now divine is not a natural
[2:34] power, right?
[2:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; According as his divine power hath given
[2:40] unto us all things.
[2:45] Hey, somebody reading with me.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; His divine power had given unto us all
[2:51] things that pertain unto life and
[2:53] godliness.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; So, I've got to believe I've already
[2:56] received all things that I desire. Amen.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; His divine power has released it to me
[3:01] through the knowledge of him that had
[3:04] called us unto glory and virtue whereby
[3:07] are given unto us exceeding great and
[3:09] precious promises that by these you
[3:12] might be partakers of the divine nature
[3:16] having escaped the corruption that is in
[3:17] the world through lust and beside this
[3:19] giving all diligence add to your faith
[3:22] virtue. Amen. I'm not going to read all
[3:24] of that. You know that I was focusing on
[3:26] the divine power and the divine nature.
[3:28] We'll go to 2 Timothy chapter 1.
[3:31] Praise the Lord.
[3:34] 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 says, "For
[3:38] God had not given us the spirit of
[3:42] fear."
[3:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[3:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; God is imparting of himself. But God
[3:48] does not have fear within him.
[3:50] &gt;&gt; So he's not given us the spirit of fear,
[3:53] &gt;&gt; but of power.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:55] &gt;&gt; Which means power is a spirit.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; Are we reading correctly?
[4:00] &gt;&gt; He's not given us a spirit of fear, but
[4:02] he's given us a spirit of power
[4:05] &gt;&gt; and of love. Love is a spirit
[4:08] &gt;&gt; and a sound mind. To be in sound mind is
[4:10] a spirit. And I'm telling you that that
[4:12] is the Holy Spirit.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; To have the Holy Spirit is to have
[4:16] power.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Is to have love and is to have a sound
[4:20] mind.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's pray.
[4:23] Father, we thank you for your word. We
[4:24] pray Lord that you the author will take
[4:26] the word and break it into our hearts
[4:27] now. Bless the hearer of the word. We
[4:29] commit the service into your hands. We
[4:31] pray Lord the needs of the people be met
[4:33] as your word is preached. We ask your
[4:34] blessings in Jesus name. Amen.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; May be seated.
[4:39] How many of you know what overtime is?
[4:43] What extra time is.
[4:45] Amen.
[4:47] I believe we're in extra time. Amen.
[4:53] &gt;&gt; We're in the closing stages of the
[4:55] Gentile dispensation.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; What that means more plainly is that God
[4:59] is fixing to end his work with the
[5:00] Gentiles
[5:02] &gt;&gt; and he's planning to go back to the Jews
[5:04] &gt;&gt; under a Moses and Elijah ministry.
[5:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; So under Moses and Elijah ministry,
[5:14] &gt;&gt; there is no more repentance for the
[5:16] Gentiles.
[5:18] They will have to go through the
[5:19] tribulation.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; And I want you to also tell you there
[5:22] will be no repentance once the rapture
[5:25] is taking place or once you are dead.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; You can't repent in heaven.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:33] &gt;&gt; If if our lives need to be made right,
[5:35] it needs to be made right now. Yes.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; If we are fooling around or messing
[5:41] around with the word, it needs to be
[5:42] made right now before
[5:45] &gt;&gt; the Lord closes the door.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; Because if you read Matthew 25, when he
[5:50] closed the door, they come banging on
[5:52] the door.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; And the door is not open. There's no
[5:55] more grace.
[5:56] &gt;&gt; There's no more favor being poured out.
[5:59] &gt;&gt; Right now, while his grace and favor is
[6:00] being poured out,
[6:02] &gt;&gt; we are to get into the hack of safety.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; And let me ask you this. If Jesus was to
[6:07] come tomorrow, what changes in your life
[6:11] would you have to make?
[6:13] If Jesus was coming tomorrow between
[6:16] 6:00 and 9,
[6:19] what changes would you have to make?
[6:21] What repenting would you have to do?
[6:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; And if and if there are things there
[6:29] that are there that we need to sort out,
[6:31] I say let's sort it out this morning.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; I say let's not leave it for another
[6:35] day. Hallelujah.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; Because no man know the hour or the day
[6:38] that Jesus will come back.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; So like I say, we are over time.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; We're in extra time, which means the
[6:46] clock is ticking.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; The clock is winding down.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:56] So when we are looking at divine nature,
[6:59] out of divine nature is coming a divine
[7:01] character. And out of divine character
[7:04] is coming a divine power. And out of
[7:06] divine power, you shall see the glory of
[7:09] God in sons and daughters of of God.
[7:10] Again,
[7:12] &gt;&gt; standing like Adam stood for the glory
[7:13] of God within him.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we know that the prerequisite
[7:19] for power is character.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; In order for charact for power to be
[7:24] used correctly, Holy Ghost power, the
[7:27] prerequisite is character. Amen.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; And God has been working to mold our
[7:32] character.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God has been working
[7:37] and molding and shaping our character.
[7:40] God has been training us. Hallelujah.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; And we mustn't despise the the training
[7:46] of the Lord.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:50] Brother Brley is saying here where
[7:52] wherefore if the power which is in the
[7:54] church as received by divine appointment
[7:56] it is due season.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; So there's a power coming into the
[8:01] church in due season.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you as well that
[8:07] there was no other age
[8:09] &gt;&gt; where the church has come to marriage
[8:12] &gt;&gt; or no other age where the church came to
[8:14] adoption.
[8:19] Hallelujah. I'm going to say it again.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; The Ephesian church age was not adopted.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; Smy church age change, Titeria church
[8:28] age change, all seven church ages were
[8:30] not adopted.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; To be adopted is to come back into Adam
[8:33] condition which means you have eternal
[8:35] life and you shall never die. I know
[8:37] where your mind is going. Your mind's
[8:39] going to Paul. Surely Paul was adopted.
[8:41] But did Paul die? Yes.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; I say there's coming a people who shall
[8:45] receive adoption, full adoption, where
[8:47] they shall not see death.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; There shall be like Enoch walked.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; Where he shall take a translation.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; So no other church age could come into
[8:57] marriage except in this end time.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Because the bride the bride had to be
[9:05] called out.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; The bride had to be elected. The bride
[9:08] had to be chosen. But up until then, the
[9:11] groom was not here on the earth.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; So, how could the marriage have taken
[9:15] place?
[9:16] &gt;&gt; The groom was not here in the Ephesian
[9:18] church age.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you read the church, seven
[9:20] church ages in Revelation chapter 2,
[9:23] you'll see all the time he's saying,
[9:24] "Lest I come. Lest I come, lest I come."
[9:27] It's only in the seven church age, the
[9:29] bridegroom comes down and he's standing
[9:31] at the door and he's knocking.
[9:35] And when that door is asking to be
[9:37] opened, he's asking for a door of
[9:39] marriage to be opened.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; But they refuse to open the door to him.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; So he's going to call out a people out
[9:45] of the age and pull them into the
[9:47] headstone.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to understand we are
[9:52] not living in the seven church age. We
[9:54] are right up there in the headstone.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; Leosia is trapped in that seven church
[10:00] age. The prophet messenger was sent to
[10:02] the Leadyian church age. He's a
[10:04] messenger to the Leosian church age. But
[10:06] the seventh angel was sent to the
[10:09] headstone people.
[10:13] &gt;&gt; You can't be formed into the headstone
[10:15] and be so alike like Jesus where the
[10:17] stone you can't tell the difference
[10:19] between the bride and the groom where
[10:21] the headstone. This is the headstone
[10:23] ministry.
[10:24] Which means we needed Elijah the prophet
[10:26] in this age and we needed a seventh
[10:28] angel to reveal the mystery of God. And
[10:31] when the mystery of God is being
[10:33] revealed, that's the door of marriage
[10:35] being opened to an end time people.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; The door of marriage because God wants
[10:39] to reveal himself. That's why the
[10:41] mystery of God is revealed.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; And you would know that when God is
[10:47] revealing the mystery, he is not
[10:49] revealing the mystery of the groom
[10:50] alone.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; Because man was made in the image of
[10:53] God, male and female created in them. So
[10:56] you can't only have a male version of
[10:59] God yet. Hallelujah.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; He's come back in this time and season
[11:05] so that the masculine and feminine
[11:06] spirit can be united together.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to read this here to just
[11:15] background what we were saying. I reckon
[11:17] the sufferings of this present time are
[11:19] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[11:21] which shall be revealed in another
[11:23] brother.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; In us.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Where's the glory in
[11:29] us?
[11:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; Unless we suffer with him, we cannot
[11:33] reign with him.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; We know them that overcome that seven
[11:38] church age. He says, if you overcome
[11:40] this age, I'll make you rule and reign
[11:42] with me on my throne.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; But he says, unless we suffer with him,
[11:45] we cannot reign with him.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; You have to suffer to reign.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; The reason for this is that character
[11:54] simply is never made without suffering.
[11:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Character is a victory.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; Not a gift.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; I say again, you can't come to the front
[12:08] and say, "Pastor, please pray for good
[12:10] character.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; Character is not imparted.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Character is is not given.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; Character is shaped and molded.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; A man without character can't reign
[12:21] because power apart from character is
[12:23] satanic."
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Look at what's happening.
[12:27] If you can type up there. Amen. Maybe
[12:29] you type it up. Real false prophet.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Who's got a phone here? Brother Caleb,
[12:36] you got your phone on you. I want you to
[12:39] Google what's a sports name. Real name
[12:41] now, not Leo,
[12:45] right? You you find that quote now.
[12:47] Let's finish reading this quote. It
[12:49] says, "But power with character is fit
[12:51] to rule.
[12:56] So God has been molding and shaping our
[12:58] character. But our rulership doesn't
[13:00] start
[13:02] &gt;&gt; when we leave here.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Our rulership must start now.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; Now are we the sons and daughters of
[13:09] God?
[13:10] &gt;&gt; Now are we taking back?
[13:12] &gt;&gt; Now are we having dominion?
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[13:18] Amen. Surprised to see brother Nathaniel
[13:20] here. God bless you. Did you welcome
[13:22] brother Nathaniel? Amen. Let's welcome
[13:24] him. Praise the Lord. That's going to
[13:25] show his son.
[13:28] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[13:31] Did we find it? Real false prophet. Did
[13:33] you find it? Okay, let's go here and
[13:34] see. This is just an observation,
[13:36] people. Observation.
[13:39] Hear what the prophet of God is saying.
[13:40] He says, "The ages come in with false
[13:42] prophets and they will go out with false
[13:44] prophets." Now, of course, there's going
[13:46] to be a real false prophet
[13:49] &gt;&gt; with the Caleb. What's his name?
[13:53] So what's his initials?
[13:55] &gt;&gt; RPL.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Is that a coincidence?
[14:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Caleb, say his name out loud
[14:06] again.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Robert Francis.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; Post.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; Robert Francis.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Preost.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; But the prophet is saying there will
[14:18] come a real false prophet. And this
[14:21] guy's initials is RFP.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; I say it's not a coincidence.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; He's a real provost.
[14:32] [Music]
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So observe that.
[14:36] And he says since he wants us to share
[14:38] even his throne on the same basis that
[14:41] he overcame and he sat down in his
[14:43] father's throne, then we have to
[14:44] overcome to sit with him. And the little
[14:47] temporary suffering we go through now is
[14:49] not worthy to be compared to the
[14:50] tremendous glory that will be revealed
[14:52] in us when he comes. Or what treasures
[14:55] are laid up for those who are willing to
[14:56] enter into his kingdom through much
[14:58] tribulation.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Here he says,
[15:02] "Think it not strange concerning the
[15:04] fiery trials that will try you. Is it
[15:07] strange that God wants to develop our
[15:09] Christlike character that comes through
[15:11] suffering?" No, sir. And we all have
[15:13] trials. We all have to be tried and
[15:16] chasing the sun. Not one goes out
[15:18] through that. But through that, the
[15:20] church that is not suffering and is not
[15:22] being tried as God. It isn't of God.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a power that's been
[15:34] released to the church.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Sometimes things can be released to us
[15:38] and we are not conscious of it.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. or we are not sufficiently
[15:43] impressed with what we have and we are
[15:45] looking for something else.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; Right now we are in the cycle of the
[15:50] rapture.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; The headstone has come down with a
[15:54] shout.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; When you see that cloud picture, that is
[15:58] not an ordinary picture.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; This was Christ on Sunset Mountain.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:08] This was Christ on Sunset Mountain.
[16:11] This was the headstone coming to unite
[16:13] with the body.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Somebody say amen.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not here to preach just ABCs.
[16:21] I'm here to preach algebra as well.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Me, I'm a very qualified teacher. I can
[16:26] preach ABCs and I can preach algebra.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not like your teachers at school
[16:30] where they're only teaching Africans.
[16:33] They can't teach you another subject.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:37] But the message of the hour that came
[16:39] when the mighty angel came down was to
[16:41] give us rapturing faith.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; We can preach all kinds of faith, but
[16:45] that's not what's going to translate us
[16:46] in this hour.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; The kind of faith that's needed now is
[16:52] perfect faith.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; And perfect faith can only be preached
[16:56] by the revelation of the word. So we've
[16:58] got to understand the deeper things as
[17:00] well.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can show you Adam. Do you know
[17:05] that Adam could speak to nature?
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Pull up Matthew 17:20. Then
[17:10] &gt;&gt; how many of you know Ma uh Adam could
[17:12] speak to nature?
[17:14] &gt;&gt; Adam could speak to the winds.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Adam could speak to the ways. How many
[17:17] of you would say, "What faith is that?"
[17:19] Somebody tell me, "What kind of faith is
[17:20] that?"
[17:24] &gt;&gt; What kind of faith is that?
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:28] How about if I told you that wasn't
[17:29] perfect faith?
[17:32] That that was a measure of faith.
[17:34] Because if you put up Matthew 17:20
[17:36] there, I'll show you by what authority
[17:38] Adam was operating by because he was
[17:40] growing to the mature state of the word.
[17:42] He was coming up to be like Melzdc.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; Adam was moving mountains.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Let's read. If you have faith as a grain
[17:54] of a mustard seed, you shall say to this
[17:56] mountain, "Remove from here ends to
[17:59] yonder place, and it shall remove, and
[18:02] nothing shall be impossible to you."
[18:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; What kind of faith did Adam have?
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Hey, are we reading Bible yet? What kind
[18:15] of faith did Adam have?
[18:18] &gt;&gt; With just mustard seed faith, he was
[18:20] moving mountains. He was speaking to
[18:22] winds.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; He was speaking to nature.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; He was controlling the animals with
[18:28] mustard seed faith.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; But he had to have the faith of Melzdc.
[18:32] And he was growing up into the stage.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; But Eve couldn't wait for him to receive
[18:37] perfect faith.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; Because while he possessed the power to
[18:41] speak to mountains, while he possessed
[18:43] the power to speak to winds and to speak
[18:45] to waves, he didn't have the power of
[18:47] creation.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; He didn't. He was still growing up into
[18:56] the image of Melazedc where he could go
[18:58] to him. You shall have a son
[19:01] &gt;&gt; and his name shall be called Abel.
[19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; He was still developing the creative
[19:07] power.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; But he was a son of God because remember
[19:11] go read Genesis 1:27 again. In the image
[19:14] of God created he them. God left out the
[19:19] the likeness. Genesis 1:26, he says,
[19:22] "I'll create them in my image and
[19:23] likeness."
[19:24] &gt;&gt; When he finally creates them, he says,
[19:26] "In the image of God created in them."
[19:28] Likeness is missing. So, which means
[19:30] Adam had to grow from faith.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Mustard seed faith
[19:34] &gt;&gt; to virtue, to knowledge, to temperance,
[19:36] to patience, to godliness, to brotherly
[19:39] kindness.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But while he was coming up
[19:43] into the likeness of God to stand there
[19:45] in the image because remember Mazdc is
[19:48] the perfect state of the word
[19:51] &gt;&gt; and Adam was a spoken seed word
[19:55] &gt;&gt; son of God.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; So he was coming up to maturity. Is is
[19:59] everybody understanding this?
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just proved it to you by
[20:03] scripture Matthew 17:20 that being able
[20:05] to speak to mountains speak to wind
[20:07] where nothing shall be impossible to
[20:09] you. You only need mustard seed faith.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; But to have creative power
[20:18] &gt;&gt; to be able to speak spirits into
[20:19] existence
[20:22] &gt;&gt; requires mazes kind of faith.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; And that is what we are after right now.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; We are not wanting wishy-washy kind of
[20:31] faith here.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you how many of you mothers
[20:34] here that cook, you seen what a mustard
[20:36] seed is?
[20:38] I was actually going to bring some
[20:39] mustard seeds
[20:41] &gt;&gt; and give you one mustard seed because
[20:43] Jesus said if you have the faith of a
[20:46] mustard seed, not 10 mustard seeds,
[20:47] right?
[20:48] &gt;&gt; And I was going to give it to you and
[20:49] make you hold it in your hand and ask
[20:51] you at the end of the service if you
[20:52] still have it because I guarantee you
[20:54] that thing would have been lost.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; It's hard to hold on to mustard seed
[20:58] faith.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring it next week for you.
[21:03] Show me your mustard seed at the end of
[21:05] the service or see if you fumbled it.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; So mustard seed faith won't sustain us
[21:11] in this time and season.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, we need to read perfect faith.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus lived in a word unto himself.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus was able to speak. Amen. Because
[21:21] he had the Amen. the fullness of the
[21:23] Godhead living within him.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; Now you and I don't possess the fullness
[21:27] of the Godhead individually.
[21:31] We have a portion of the Holy Ghost.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you can say testify to
[21:36] that?
[21:38] &gt;&gt; We've seen the closest we've seen to the
[21:40] fullness of the God and in a man was in
[21:42] the seventh angel was in Malachi 4.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; He was a son of man revealing this son
[21:47] of man.
[21:48] [Music]
[21:49] &gt;&gt; But after he left, the Holy Ghost was
[21:52] sent out in portions. Yes.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; So which means if I want the Holy Ghost
[21:55] to be more powerful,
[21:57] &gt;&gt; I need to connect with the Holy Ghost in
[21:59] you.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Because just one of us can put a
[22:02] thousand to flight.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; But two of us can send a legion fleeing.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; The Bible says if two or more agree upon
[22:09] any touching anything,
[22:10] &gt;&gt; it shall be given. So I've got to
[22:12] connect with another member of the body
[22:14] and another member of the body and
[22:16] another member of the body. And as we
[22:18] are connecting, the Holy Ghost power is
[22:20] getting stronger. Divine power is
[22:22] getting stronger. That's why this body
[22:24] is fully framed and we cannot do without
[22:26] one another.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; That's why we can't project ourselves as
[22:30] the man of this person. Amen. We've got
[22:32] to realize we need one another and we
[22:35] cannot operate independently.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Do you know what we are carrying within
[22:42] us now? I was telling you that we are
[22:43] carrying the power of the shout.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has come with a shout. He
[22:49] does all three things as descending.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; So he's here now in the power of the
[22:54] shout.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; The power of the shout is to call you
[22:57] out of denominations. The power of the
[22:59] shout is to call you out of religions.
[23:01] The power of the shout is to call you
[23:02] out of man-made religions and to pull
[23:04] you into heavenly places where Jesus
[23:07] Christ is sitting.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same power that was in Jesus
[23:12] is the same power that's in you and I.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen now. We are carrying the
[23:18] power of the shout.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the shout to us? It's a
[23:22] message going forth to gather the living
[23:24] saints.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; We are gathering the living saints. When
[23:30] we are prophesying and calling somebody
[23:32] into the into the truth, the revealed
[23:34] truth of this day, we are using the
[23:36] power of the shout.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; I say that we know how to operate the
[23:40] power of the shout. Amen.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was teaching me, not me,
[23:44] was teaching at Wright how to use the
[23:46] power of the shout.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; You got to know how to access the power
[23:51] of the shout.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; There are certain powers that you need
[23:54] to know how to harness.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; You need to know how to use it. You need
[23:57] to know how to control it. But the shout
[24:00] is the message. Amen. Is the living
[24:02] bread of life. And bread must be given
[24:04] to people who are starving.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:10] Praise the Lord.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; It is called the living bread of life.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; So, you can give bread to the hungry.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Now, let me tell you, I'm going give you
[24:21] a couple examples, maybe just three. You
[24:23] can use the power of the shout to go
[24:25] after your lost fallen brother.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; The power of the shout is what made
[24:30] Abraham go and rescue Lot.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; He was carrying a message.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; He was carrying a message of blessing.
[24:37] He was carrying a message of you shall
[24:39] have a son.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; He was carrying a message of I'll make
[24:41] you a great nation. He was carrying this
[24:44] message. But this message that he was
[24:46] carrying had a power.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; And when time came that he needed to
[24:50] access this power, he told his trained
[24:53] servants, let's go after lot.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; Which means that we are carrying the
[24:58] message of the hour.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; And there's a power in the message of
[25:02] the hour that we can unlock to go after
[25:05] our lost fallen brothers.
[25:07] Amen. You can also go maybe your your
[25:09] family member right now is not here.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Somebody get this and
[25:14] somebody access doors that are opening
[25:15] right now.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mother went to Mary who was
[25:20] trapped in a house of mourning.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Her brother had died. She's there
[25:23] trapped with denominational people in
[25:25] there in a house of mourning
[25:29] &gt;&gt; backslidden.
[25:31] But Martha uses the power of the shout
[25:33] &gt;&gt; to go to Mary and say, "The master has
[25:36] come and call it for thee." She pulls
[25:39] her out of that situation. She pulls her
[25:41] out of the house of morning. I say even
[25:44] now, you've got to be able to use the
[25:46] power that's laying in the message of
[25:47] the hour to pull your loved ones out.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; The problem is we have too many
[25:53] conservative message believers. We need
[25:55] some radical message believers. Amen.
[25:58] Who are not ashamed to take God at his
[26:00] word.
[26:01] Hallelujah.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; I tell you, try the power one time. I
[26:06] say even right now while you are sitting
[26:08] there, call your loved ones name.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; Pull them out. There's a power right
[26:11] now. What I'm speaking.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said? The message is
[26:16] a living word.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; It's a living word, which means when
[26:20] living word is released by the lips of
[26:23] faith, it's got to bring it back. The
[26:25] word can't return void. Call your loved
[26:28] ones now.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen, Jesus.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just showed you how Abraham
[26:37] brought back Lot.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; I showed you how Martha brought back
[26:40] Mary.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Using the power of the shout. And where
[26:44] did she bring her? She brought her to
[26:45] the voice of the resurrection.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. She brought her to show her that
[26:50] he had now moved past the shout.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And the voice of the
[26:54] resurrection was on the scene getting
[26:57] ready to call out sleeping Lazarus.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; So you've got to go with a message of
[27:03] urgency.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Your message is urgent. Hey, you're
[27:07] going to miss the shout. You're not
[27:08] going to make the rapture.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; So Martha goes to call Mary and says,
[27:13] "Come out."
[27:15] &gt;&gt; What's the matter with you? Why you
[27:16] going back to denomination? Why you
[27:18] backsliding in the house of mourning?
[27:20] Come where Jesus is. Amen.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; She made it in the nick of time to where
[27:24] Jesus was ready there for the power of
[27:26] the show. But it was transitioning now
[27:28] to the voice of the resurrection. And
[27:30] Jesus says to her, "I am the
[27:31] resurrection and the life. He that
[27:33] believeth in me, though he were dead,
[27:35] yet shall he live. I speak a word over
[27:38] you, your loved one, though they are
[27:40] dead in denomination, though they are
[27:42] dead in their sins right now. By the
[27:44] power of the spoken word, I call him. I
[27:46] am the resurrection and the life. He
[27:48] that believeth on me, though he were
[27:49] dead, yet shall he live. And if he live,
[27:52] he shall never die.
[27:54] [Applause]
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Auntie Wright was talking to the
[27:58] prophet.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; And she was the first one to hear the
[28:01] testimony of the squirrels.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; But a testimony is not to puff up
[28:06] somebody.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; If you're ever going to use a testimony,
[28:10] is there to encourage the next person
[28:12] &gt;&gt; to tell them such as I have received,
[28:14] give I unto you. Amen.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; The power, the words of a son of God in
[28:19] this time and seasons, I give it to you.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; And the prophet was sitting there
[28:23] telling her about this hunting
[28:24] experience and how he was hunting and
[28:26] there was no squirrels.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; And the Lord told him, "Didn't you come
[28:30] here to hunt?"
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; He says, "Yes, Lord, but there's no
[28:33] squirrels." He says, "Well, why don't
[28:34] you speak the squirrel into existence?"
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Creative power is laying in sons and
[28:39] daughters of God.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; You're saying it's not so. How did
[28:44] Elijah speak a word over this woman that
[28:47] her oil and a meal didn't run dry?
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Hey, we are not ordinary people.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; We are packed with power,
[28:54] &gt;&gt; divine power, not man-made power.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Speak to your situation. Speak to
[28:59] your finances. Speak to your bad dry
[29:01] covered. Speak to barren homes. Amen.
[29:03] You are carrying the power of the shout.
[29:05] Amen. And open the door this morning.
[29:08] Open the door this morning. In fact, if
[29:10] you don't want to open the door this
[29:11] morning, the Holy Spirit is here to
[29:13] break down every door.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; Because time and season has come where
[29:20] you've got to know the power that we are
[29:22] carrying.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We can't be living
[29:26] mediocre lives. We were not called to
[29:28] live mediocre lives.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, at right, the
[29:33] children are not saved right there when
[29:36] she agreed with what the prophet says.
[29:38] The prophet says God spoke out of her
[29:40] heart.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; He says ask what you will.
[29:45] He says I thought about it. You can also
[29:48] think about it right now.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; You see all of you didn't realize you
[29:53] were agreeing with the word all this
[29:54] time that I've been preaching.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; The same atmosphere ate was under.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; She was agreeing with the prophet's
[30:00] word.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; All of youall have been agreeing with my
[30:03] word.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:06] under the same atmosphere and the same
[30:08] conditions.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; You can speak and call your loved one.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; They were not saved. She says, "I
[30:13] desire." There was a sister in a
[30:15] wheelchair.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; But she says, "Oh, Edith is old now.
[30:19] Even if she comes out of a wheelchair,
[30:21] there's not much benefit in her being
[30:23] healed out of that wheelchair right now.
[30:25] Even though it seemed like the humane
[30:26] thing to do, uh, you're a poor woman,
[30:29] auntie. Why don't you speak and ask for
[30:31] a suitcase of money?
[30:36] In this in this age that we live in,
[30:38] most people will be tempted to do that.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; As I was sharing with you a few weeks
[30:45] ago, there is one thing that you can
[30:48] take with you from this life to the
[30:50] next.
[30:51] You can't take money, you can't take
[30:54] cars,
[30:55] &gt;&gt; you can't take houses,
[30:56] &gt;&gt; but you can do what did
[30:59] &gt;&gt; she took her children from this life
[31:02] &gt;&gt; to the next life.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; She said, "I desire the salvation of my
[31:06] two boys."
[31:07] &gt;&gt; So teach them from a young age about
[31:09] Jesus.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Tell them about why Jesus came to die
[31:12] for us.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right now, that message is being
[31:15] lost in the world.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Materialism has crept up.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Modernism has crept up. Amen. The
[31:22] technology has crept up. People have no
[31:24] time for an oldfashioned gospel
[31:26] &gt;&gt; of how we are lost in sin without Jesus.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can pull your loved ones
[31:32] out of their condition.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; I'm expecting a testimony out of that
[31:38] right now.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; The words that I speak, they are spirit
[31:44] &gt;&gt; and they are life.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; You I know some of you asking why are
[31:49] you using that words in the first spirit
[31:51] in the first person.
[31:53] I say again the words that I speak
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; They are spirit.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; And they are life.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:01] So we know there are many we're talking
[32:03] about divine power. Divine power is not
[32:05] of the earth.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; I think there's a saying I don't know if
[32:12] it's Shakespeare or which spear it is.
[32:15] Somebody spear said to air is human to
[32:18] love is divine.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; You heard that?
[32:24] &gt;&gt; To love is divine.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; I think it was Nelson Mandela. It says
[32:29] no man is born hating another person.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; People are taught to hate.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; Because you're born with love.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; That's a gift of God.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; So we have within us locked up in this
[32:44] power now that we are talking about
[32:46] divine power is the power of love.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Do you know that sometimes medicine
[32:54] don't work but love can work.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Care can work.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Compassion can work.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody's not healing. Go and shower
[33:05] them with love.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Shower them with good things.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Do you know that you hold within you?
[33:14] I'm talking about divine power now, but
[33:15] I don't I don't have time to detail
[33:17] everything, but I'm going to speak it as
[33:18] it's coming. To forgive
[33:22] is a power.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; To forgive one another of their
[33:27] trespasses against you
[33:29] &gt;&gt; is a power that you are releasing.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:35] Your now when we have this divine
[33:38] character.
[33:39] Now remember the prophet is saying that
[33:42] our character has been molded and he
[33:44] says there was never a people that has
[33:46] been molded like this end time bride.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Right. Praise the Lord.
[33:54] Now I'm saying that once we develop this
[33:56] character,
[33:58] it becomes the seat from which we rule
[34:01] and reign the earth.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; So which means our character becomes our
[34:05] power.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; The character training was not for no
[34:13] reason.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; The reason he molded us into the
[34:16] character of Jesus, maybe you need to
[34:18] put up Galatians chapter 5:22 there. The
[34:21] character of Jesus is because that was
[34:23] going to become the seat of our power
[34:26] &gt;&gt; with this godlike character. We are
[34:29] going to rule situations. We are going
[34:32] to speak to atmospheres. We are going to
[34:34] speak to problems. You can't walk into a
[34:36] room and leave it and walk into a
[34:39] problem and leave that room in the with
[34:41] the same problem or worse problem.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; You become the solution to the problem.
[34:46] You become the one that changes the
[34:48] atmosphere
[34:49] &gt;&gt; because you have developed a character
[34:51] and a wisdom that comes from God.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; You walk into an hostile situation. When
[34:56] you leave that place, peace is
[34:58] prevailing.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; This is the character,
[35:07] the fruit of the spirit.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Love. We said love is a power. Yes, sir.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Joy.
[35:16] Some people don't know what joy is. They
[35:18] only know joy on December 25th.
[35:21] Joy to the world, the Lord has come.
[35:26] Amen.
[35:27] Every other day they're a miserable
[35:29] rich.
[35:31] They love that song Amazing Grace that
[35:33] save the rich like me.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; But I've got joy like a river.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Joy like a river. Yes.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Joy like a river in my soul.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Peace.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Some people can never live peaceibly
[35:56] with all men.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; They grew up with such anger,
[36:00] such hatred.
[36:02] Nobody can tell me one word.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; I am a disturb of peace.
[36:11] Amen.
[36:14] They become a disturber of peace.
[36:17] Longsuffering.
[36:19] Longsuffering. Can you longsuffer with
[36:22] your brother? The disciples said, "Ah,
[36:24] this person's here. How long must I
[36:26] forgive you?" Seven times. Jesus says,
[36:28] "Unfortunately or fortunately, you're in
[36:30] the kingdom of heaven and yet we walk by
[36:32] multiplication."
[36:34] &gt;&gt; So, you got to forgive him 70 * 7. Amen.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; Some people have calculated now they
[36:41] say, "Hey, you got one more chance."
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. But have longsuffering. I'm
[36:49] showing you the character development.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Gentleness.
[36:54] Gentleness. The nature of a dove.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Gentle. Goodness.
[37:00] Goodness. I I say that we need to
[37:02] express more of this goodness. Yes.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; If you can't if you can't say you you
[37:07] can't say, "Lord, I can't see where I
[37:09] can express my goodness." Well, open
[37:11] your eyes.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Look to the left.
[37:16] Look to the right.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; You can express your goodness to the
[37:21] ones that's a part of your own body.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Faith. All of this, remember, is a power
[37:27] now. Love is a power. Joy, peace,
[37:29] longsuffering, gentleness. This is a
[37:31] power. Amen.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Goodness, faith. It becomes a seed from
[37:35] which you rule. Faith is a power. Amen.
[37:39] Let's go on. Meekness,
[37:44] temperance.
[37:45] Against such there is no law. Amen. I
[37:48] just want to detail the character
[37:49] development that we have been going
[37:51] through. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; So, I want to read this. It might be a
[37:56] bit lengthy, but I want to try and get
[37:57] through it as soon as possible. Amen.
[38:00] Now, I want you to lay this down here
[38:02] and I want you to see it. Praise the
[38:04] Lord.
[38:10] Hallelujah.
[38:12] He says his bride, this is now, Amen.
[38:16] his bride will have to be the same kind
[38:18] of character,
[38:20] &gt;&gt; right? Your character is God's
[38:22] character. That's the kind of character
[38:24] you are because you are the character of
[38:26] your father,
[38:28] &gt;&gt; right? Are we in that? You still looking
[38:31] for it? Amen. Praise the Lord.
[38:38] It was. Amen. Yeah. So, you got it.
[38:40] Praise the Lord. So, your character is
[38:42] your father. Now, listen to what
[38:43] character you have. How many of you
[38:46] ready for it?
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Let's get to the next one there.
[38:52] 33. He's talking about God and how he
[38:56] gave his life, right? He says the life
[38:58] watch
[39:01] the life is took for the blood. The life
[39:03] itself is took the life is took for the
[39:06] blood. The blood was applied and the
[39:07] life could not come on the believer for
[39:10] the life of an animal.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; So animal life cannot remit sin forever.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; It was a temporary
[39:18] sacrifice.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Right? But now watch what he says. But
[39:21] instead of a human being, Jesus was not
[39:26] a human being is what the prophet is
[39:27] trying to say.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Watch what he was. He was it was a super
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Super
[39:36] &gt;&gt; human being.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus was a super
[39:41] &gt;&gt; super
[39:43] human being.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; See, and that makes the human being now
[39:48] not only a human being. So he's saying
[39:51] that life has come upon us.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; If you are super super super
[39:56] &gt;&gt; what does it make you and I that's what
[39:58] the prophet is saying it does. Now we
[40:01] are not only a human being but he's a
[40:03] son and daughter of God of the super
[40:06] super super
[40:08] life that was in him.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Comes back upon you and changes you from
[40:13] a sinner and things of the world a
[40:15] church member denominational goer to a
[40:17] born again Christian filled with the
[40:19] spirit. The life of God just flowing
[40:21] from you.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; That's the power flowing from you.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many times you said super?
[40:26] Amen. You are a super super super life.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's get to the next one. He
[40:37] says, "And may the Holy Spirit in all of
[40:39] his divine power in his shakana glory
[40:42] come rolling down through the eternities
[40:44] into our heart, Lord, find his dwelling
[40:46] place for these last days."
[40:49] The Holy Spirit was not meant to float
[40:50] around like a ghost. The Holy Spirit was
[40:53] meant to tabernacle bodies.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; So I say even now, Amen. You give
[40:57] eviction orders to every demon power.
[41:00] You give eviction orders to every
[41:02] satanic force of the enemy. Amen. You
[41:04] give eviction orders to every power that
[41:06] has been illegally holding you bound.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Because he's looking for a dwelling
[41:13] place in these last days.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. and call us to the
[41:18] service as messengers. Now watch now
[41:21] most of us would think that when the
[41:22] Holy Ghost is coming like he's saying
[41:24] the Holy Ghost filling us how is it
[41:26] going to be manifested? Watch what he
[41:27] says. He says maybe not for the pulpit.
[41:32] Somebody say amen.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; But at the filling station
[41:37] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost is going to be oper in
[41:38] operation now in the filling station.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Nathaniel and brother
[41:42] Shman when you are now servicing the
[41:44] pool the Holy Ghost is going to be there
[41:49] &gt;&gt; at the wash tub
[41:51] shall be modernized while you switching
[41:54] the washing machine on
[41:56] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost is there
[41:59] &gt;&gt; but I thought it'll be high level power
[42:01] usage no in your daily life
[42:05] &gt;&gt; at the police station washed up wherever
[42:08] it might be to testify to the milkman
[42:11] Amen.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; To the paper boy
[42:13] &gt;&gt; or whatever it might be.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Now I know we're not used to accustomed
[42:18] to this kind of teaching
[42:21] &gt;&gt; because we only want high levels of the
[42:22] Holy Ghost outpouring of power at a
[42:25] prayer line maybe.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; But he's saying take it to your daily
[42:29] activities.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; The power of the Holy Ghost. What are we
[42:32] talking about? The super super super
[42:34] life.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; God wants to manifest you now. The
[42:38] filling station. Amen.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; And the milkman.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Whatever it might be,
[42:48] make us testimonies and living stones
[42:50] filled with the shakina glory. The Holy
[42:53] Spirit himself fill our hearts and
[42:55] lives, Father.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Now, this is what I want you to get to.
[42:59] The true church of Jesus Christ, the
[43:01] bride, is likened to pure gold. How many
[43:03] of you like gold?
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Some of you don't like gold.
[43:09] I'll make you smile. I'll show it on
[43:10] your teeth there.
[43:12] Amen. Praise the Lord. You really like
[43:14] gold. Amen. People like to put gold on
[43:16] their tooth because when they smile,
[43:18] they want you to sparkle.
[43:21] Amen.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; They value gold so much that they put it
[43:24] in their mouth. Praise the Lord. They're
[43:28] thinking now if I die maybe that gold
[43:30] will slip into heaven.
[43:32] You know that in heaven the pavement is
[43:34] gold.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So they're going to ask you why
[43:38] you brought the pavement and came.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; The true church of Jesus Christ, the
[43:43] bride, is likened to pure gold,
[43:46] &gt;&gt; not ordinary gold. Now,
[43:47] &gt;&gt; yes, sir.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Pure gold. Her righteousness is his
[43:50] righteousness.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody needs to hear this.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; People are thinking they are not
[43:55] righteous, which is nullifying the work
[43:57] of the cross.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Your righteousness is God's
[44:00] righteousness.
[44:02] Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Her attributes are his own glorious
[44:05] attributes.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Her identity is found in him.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; What he is, she is to reflect.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; What he has, she is to manifest.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; There is no fault in her.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; I want you to go home and Google this
[44:24] and not Google it. Go look in your
[44:25] message church message search where the
[44:28] prophet says, "Shut your mouth.
[44:32] Because if I say it now, you're going to
[44:33] think I'm being rude. Jen,
[44:35] &gt;&gt; you need to tell every voice that is
[44:37] telling you that you're unrighteous.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Every voice that is telling you there's
[44:41] fault in you.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Every voice that's telling you, Amen.
[44:44] speaking against you, you need to tell
[44:46] it, "Shut your mouth."
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Silence every voice.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; There is no fault in her. She's all
[44:57] glorious within and without
[44:59] &gt;&gt; from beginning to ending. She is the
[45:01] work of her Lord and all his works are
[45:04] perfect. In fact, in her summed up and
[45:06] manifested the eternal wisdom and
[45:08] purpose of God. How can one fathom it?
[45:10] How can one understand it? Though we
[45:12] cannot do that, we accept it by faith
[45:14] for God had spoken it.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; But not only is the candlestick of gold,
[45:18] it is beaten gold and crafted of beaten
[45:20] gold according to her blueprints. You
[45:23] see, your blueprint meant that you
[45:24] needed to be beaten. I don't know if you
[45:26] know what a blueprint is. If you got a
[45:28] blueprint for this building a church
[45:30] here, you'll see it's got to be built
[45:32] according to this design and spec
[45:34] dimensions. Right? So, he's saying the
[45:37] blueprint for our lives was to be molded
[45:39] and shaped. Oh yes.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; According to her blueprints which were
[45:44] spirit given outside of her Lord and
[45:47] Master Jesus Christ was ever a people so
[45:50] beaten and purged as the bride of Jesus
[45:52] Christ. Surely she's filling up the
[45:55] sufferings that Christ has left behind.
[45:57] Her goods are deso despoise. Her life is
[46:00] in jeopardy. She's accounted as sheep
[46:02] for the slaughter. She's killed all of
[46:04] the day long. She suffers much. But in
[46:06] all is ret in all it retaliates not
[46:10] neither does she cause others to suffer.
[46:14] Worthy of the gospel is this lovely
[46:16] bride of Christ.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Lord
[46:19] &gt;&gt; and as gold is malible whereas brass
[46:21] will break with a beating. This gold of
[46:24] God will bear a suffering for the Lord.
[46:26] Not bowed, not broken, not destroyed,
[46:28] but formed as a thing of beauty and a
[46:30] joy forever by the trials and testings
[46:33] of this life.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, where where does this leave
[46:45] us? We are here right now. Amen. If you
[46:49] go and read Genesis 1 verse 20 from to
[46:52] where God is telling Adam to multiply
[46:54] and replenish the earth, there is one
[46:56] species that was not reproduced
[47:01] &gt;&gt; from the original creation. One species
[47:04] was not reproduced
[47:07] &gt;&gt; and that's the God man species.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Adam's life was not reproduced the way
[47:13] it was supposed to be reproduced.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; So which means the God man was not
[47:18] reproduced on the earth.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; So Malachi 4:5 and 6 come to turn our
[47:26] hearts back to our origins.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. come to reveal to us our pedigree
[47:29] and our gene seed to tell us we are
[47:31] going back to our riches and Jesus
[47:34] Christ is now going to have a bride and
[47:36] reproduce the God man again.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Go to Matthew 28 verse 18. Hallelujah.
[47:48] Jesus is saying and Jesus came and spake
[47:52] unto them saying all power is given.
[47:54] Now, how many of you know what the word
[47:56] all means?
[48:02] &gt;&gt; All power is given unto me.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; You mean all power in heaven? Yes.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; All power on the earth. Yes.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Is where? In Jesus.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying is given to me. Yes.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Now, because all power is given unto me,
[48:22] we all just quote Matthew 28:19, but
[48:25] it's following verse 18. He says, "Now,
[48:27] because all power in heaven is given
[48:29] unto me, all power in earth is given
[48:31] unto me, I'm releasing this power to
[48:33] you."
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now he goes to 28:19. Go
[48:37] with this power
[48:39] &gt;&gt; and teach all nations
[48:42] &gt;&gt; baptizing them in the name of the father
[48:45] and of the son and of the holy ghost.
[48:47] There is no such thing as a trinity.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Notice what he's saying. The name of the
[48:52] father
[48:54] &gt;&gt; and of the son and of the holy ghost.
[48:56] When you get baptized, the pastor or the
[48:58] priest shouldn't come there and say
[49:02] whatever they say in the name of the
[49:04] father, in the name of the son, in the
[49:06] name of the holy ghost. If I you are
[49:08] sensible people, he's saying in the
[49:10] name. So what is the name?
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible is saying baptize in the name.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; And we know that the prophet came to
[49:22] reveal to us the name is the Lord Jesus
[49:26] Christ.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; So you must be baptized in the name of
[49:29] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; If you were baptized in the father, son,
[49:33] and holy ghost, you are not baptized in
[49:35] the name of the father, son, and holy
[49:37] ghost.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; You were baptized in titles.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Is father a title?
[49:43] If I ask you what's your father's name,
[49:45] you can't tell me your father's name is
[49:46] father
[49:47] &gt;&gt; unless he's really name father in the
[49:49] book
[49:52] &gt;&gt; his name the name of the son you can't
[49:54] tell me if I ask you what's the name of
[49:56] your son
[49:59] even though at home you call him son
[50:01] that's not his name
[50:03] &gt;&gt; he's got a name
[50:09] &gt;&gt; and the name of the Holy Ghost
[50:13] Yeah.
[50:15] Jesus said, "I came in my father's
[50:16] name."
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "I'll send another one
[50:23] in my name."
[50:25] So the father, son, and holy ghost all
[50:27] have the same name.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Now, I know when you get to heaven, some
[50:35] of you going to play hiding game. You're
[50:36] going to come ready or not? Here I come.
[50:39] You can look for the father.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; You can look for the son.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; You look for holy ghost separately.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:51] The entire fullness of the godhead and
[50:53] you'll see it in Jesus Christ.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:02] So he's releasing a power and I'm saying
[51:04] this power is not given to you by man.
[51:07] Holy Ghost power is not given to you by
[51:08] man. This divine power we are talking
[51:11] about is not given to you by man. It's
[51:13] not given by governments. It's not given
[51:15] amen to operate in the earthly kingdom.
[51:17] But this is far more superior. The
[51:19] highest power that is in heaven and
[51:21] earth.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; In fact, we need a power to wrestle
[51:27] against demon powers.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; It says in Ephesians 6:12, we wrestle
[51:31] not against flesh and blood.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. but against principalities, powers,
[51:36] against the rulers of darkness of this
[51:38] world, against spiritual wickedness in
[51:40] high places. So what we need is
[51:42] spiritual power is needed to confront
[51:45] these spiritual realms.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; How many of you are reading that? We are
[51:48] not fighting fleshly battles here. We
[51:50] are fighting spiritual battles.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; They sometimes manifest in the flesh.
[51:55] You'll find this brother picking on you.
[51:56] You'll find this brother saying things
[51:58] that is not the brother. That is a demon
[51:59] power that has possessed that person to
[52:01] come against you. And as long as you
[52:03] fight in the flesh and blood, you are
[52:05] not going to win the battle. You need to
[52:06] go into spiritual realms and start to
[52:09] bind that spirit. Amen. Whatsoever you
[52:11] bind on earth is bound in heaven.
[52:13] Whatsoever you loose on earth is loosed
[52:15] in heaven. We've got to realize the
[52:17] power that's laying within us.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; But all we want to do is roll up our
[52:20] sleeves and act. We've got to go
[52:22] spiritual when people are going carnal.
[52:25] When people are going fleshly, we've got
[52:26] to go spiritually.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. realms unseen to the human eye but
[52:33] realms that exist.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; There are realms that are unseen to the
[52:38] human eye. Sometimes you see a person
[52:40] demon possessed, you can't see that
[52:42] realm but yet you can see that demon
[52:43] manifesting in them. That realm exists.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you read there in in Revelation
[52:52] chapter Amen chapter what's it six
[52:57] he says hell followed this rider on the
[52:59] horse.
[53:00] So, which means hell is let loose upon
[53:02] the earth right now.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. This is the time,
[53:07] Amen, where people are lusting for
[53:09] power. Look at what's happening there in
[53:11] the in the Middle East.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; They want atomic power.
[53:16] Israel and America says, "No, we don't
[53:17] want them to have atomic power."
[53:20] I wonder why we in this season now
[53:22] there's a fight for power, atomic power.
[53:24] While we are talking about divine power,
[53:27] I want to let you know that divine power
[53:29] is more powerful than atomic power.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; What you seen happen in in Nagasaki and
[53:35] Hiroshima, that atomic bomb, you seen
[53:37] devastation in May. How many of you have
[53:39] seen that?
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. They say they're still living off
[53:43] some of the effects of that atomic
[53:45] power.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And right now, they have so
[53:47] advanced in nuclear abilities. But I
[53:50] tell you, the power that you possess,
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can even stop an atomic bomb.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Hey, come on.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; How can you have super super super super
[54:02] life
[54:04] &gt;&gt; and a bomb be more powerful than you?
[54:09] &gt;&gt; You are more powerful than the atomic
[54:11] bomb.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we find every nation is lusting
[54:19] now. Amen. trying to show themselves
[54:21] superior with superior power. Some are
[54:24] flexing with military power. Amen. Some
[54:26] are flexing with economic power. Look at
[54:28] China, the economic power. Look at
[54:30] India, the economic power.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; America knows they are no match for
[54:34] these two powers.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; America is unsure of the military power
[54:41] of Russia. Unsure of the military power
[54:43] of Iran. Amen. And and and people are
[54:47] flexing the religious power. All kinds
[54:50] of power.
[54:52] Amen. People are flexing the political
[54:55] power.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and nation, Amen. flexing also
[54:59] demonic power.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Passing all kinds of laws in the land.
[55:05] Gay marriages, homosexuals.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; These are not normal things.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; A male and a male can't produce a baby.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; A female and a female can't reproduce a
[55:18] baby. It's only a male and a female.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; So we find in the midst of all the
[55:25] flexing of power, military, political,
[55:27] religious, demonic power, economic
[55:29] power, a people have been transformed by
[55:32] the renewing of their minds.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. A people who are a new creation.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; A people for which all creation has been
[55:40] groaning for.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; All the earth has been groaning, waiting
[55:44] for you.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. for this time and season because
[55:47] you carry within you a power.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; But God has been developing our
[55:53] character.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Because this power is about to be
[55:55] unleashed upon the earth.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; The God man species is being reproduced
[56:01] on the earth right now.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Even through the preaching of the word,
[56:04] God is taking out. Amen. All doubt. God
[56:06] is taking all fear and the fate is being
[56:08] swn into the hearts of the people.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. People want to see all
[56:15] kinds of manifestations. People want
[56:17] bubble gum prophecies.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Somebody out there. Somebody out there.
[56:22] Somebody out there.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; I want you to know we've had a prophet
[56:27] that didn't use the word somebody.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Now we're slipping into denominational
[56:33] styles.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; And people in the audience so gullible
[56:39] is screaming amen.
[56:43] I thought we supposed to be word solid
[56:47] &gt;&gt; when a prophecy is coming forth.
[56:51] You stay in what road?
[56:54] Your name is Joshua?
[56:58] Direct.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Precise.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Telling them what's wrong with them.
[57:06] Yes.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Telling them ex exactly which doctor you
[57:08] you went to see a certain doctor
[57:10] &gt;&gt; or I see another tall man praying for
[57:12] you.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; You were you were standing there in the
[57:15] prayer line of Oral Roberts.
[57:18] People are impersonating
[57:21] &gt;&gt; the impersonation
[57:23] &gt;&gt; of giftings.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus said don't judge them
[57:29] &gt;&gt; by their judge them by their fruits.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:36] Amen. Let's bring this to a close now.
[57:40] The divine character of God, the divine
[57:42] power of God, the divine glory of God.
[57:45] Amen. This is the man that God has
[57:47] created in his image and likeness. Amen.
[57:50] And these people are being reproduced on
[57:52] the earth now.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; You see, some of you are sitting here
[57:58] with a problem. You're sitting here with
[57:59] a situation and you're thinking, "How is
[58:01] this going to help me?" I'm telling you
[58:03] if you can rise up to your true
[58:05] potential as a son of God

[58:13] &gt;&gt; say bro I need five rand why are you
[58:15] telling me about being a son of god the
[58:16] son of god if you stand up in your true
[58:18] potential five rand will be nothing

[58:26] &gt;&gt; you'll be able to operate in your
[58:28] potential
[58:29] &gt;&gt; hey when called I don't know maybe you
[58:31] need to reread your bible
[58:33] Yes.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; When God calls Abraham, he says, "I'm
[58:35] going to bless you."
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Your seed after you will be blessed.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Some of you saying, "My seed after me, I
[58:44] don't know what's going to happen to
[58:45] them."
[58:47] &gt;&gt; But the Bible is saying your seed after
[58:49] you is going to be blessed.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; It says a wise man leaves an inheritance
[58:53] for his children's children.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; And you know what? It's not too late.
[59:00] Yes.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; It don't matter your age. Right now, you
[59:02] can turn your situation around.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; How? Get into and tap into the divine
[59:06] power of God.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Hear what he's saying.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Re look at your life and see maybe
[59:12] situations he was building your
[59:13] character and you refuse character
[59:15] training.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:19] Romans 8:37 says, "In all things we are
[59:21] more than conquerors through him that
[59:23] loved us."
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; I persuade us neither death, the power
[59:26] of death can't touch me.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. No life, no angels,
[59:30] principalities, no powers, things
[59:32] present, or things to come, height,
[59:34] depth, no other creature shall be able
[59:36] to separate me from the power of the
[59:37] love of God.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Which is Christ Jesus our Lord.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Divine revelation is a power. Now
[59:44] listen to this. Divine revelation is a
[59:46] power released to you.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; You have a revelation of this message.
[59:51] That's a power released to you.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Listen again. Divine revelation is a
[59:56] power that's released to you. You are
[59:58] thinking you're just an ordinary person.
[59:59] But I believe this message and I believe
[1:00:01] such a powerful prophet that's a divine
[1:00:03] power released to you.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Revelation is a power.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; But we don't realize it
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; that we can speak a word to somebody and
[1:00:13] it can break shackles off of them.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; It can break Amen. strongholds.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Listen to the
[1:00:21] quote. If the people, if the ecclesia,
[1:00:24] the church gets a true revelation. So
[1:00:28] revelation is a power
[1:00:30] of what she is. What is she? She's the
[1:00:32] wife.
[1:00:34] She's a son of God. What she stands for.
[1:00:36] She can do the greater works. She will
[1:00:38] be an invincible army.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; If they get a true revelation of the
[1:00:42] true spirits in the framework of the
[1:00:44] Christian church, he's able to discern
[1:00:46] and withstand the Antichrist spirit.
[1:00:48] Satan will be powerless before her. Let
[1:00:50] me tell you something. The gates of hell
[1:00:52] cannot prevail against you.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Satan hates revelation,
[1:00:57] but we love it."
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; With true revelation in our lives, the
[1:01:01] gates of hell cannot prevail against us,
[1:01:03] but we will prevail over them. He takes
[1:01:06] the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or
[1:01:08] we fail to get it. Amen. Didn't Jesus
[1:01:11] say, "Amen." When he was asking Peter,
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; who do men say that I am?
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "Thou art the Christ."
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. the son of the living God.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; What did Jesus tell him?
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood didn't reveal this to
[1:01:26] you.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood can't give you this kind
[1:01:30] of revelation.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "But my father in heaven, he
[1:01:34] has revealed it to you."
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; So in other words, he was telling him a
[1:01:38] power was released to you, Peter.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; The power of revelation.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says with this power of
[1:01:44] revelation, Satan and his army, these
[1:01:46] 200 million demons that are let loose
[1:01:48] upon the earth, they cannot prevail
[1:01:50] against your power. They cannot prevail
[1:01:53] against your revelation. You can say,
[1:01:55] Satan, it is written.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; It is written over my family. It is
[1:01:59] written over my life. I break
[1:02:01] generational curses even now. Amen.
[1:02:04] Things that my father carried, things
[1:02:05] that my grandfather carried. I break
[1:02:08] that curse and that cycle in my life.
[1:02:10] You're going through situations. You're
[1:02:12] going through problems. You can't
[1:02:13] understand why you're in a holding
[1:02:15] pattern because the word of God declares
[1:02:17] unto the fourth generation will I bring
[1:02:19] this curse upon you. But you have the
[1:02:21] power of the blood. You have the power
[1:02:23] of the Holy Ghost to break every
[1:02:25] generational curse even now.
[1:02:29] [Applause]
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; How many of you know what your
[1:02:33] grandfather did? You don't know.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; But that thing is plaguing you.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you have the power to speak a
[1:02:42] word and break it right now.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; I say poverty lines are stricken off.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Only two of you receive it
[1:02:50] right now. I say you can break the lines
[1:02:52] of poverty in the name of Jesus. Amen.
[1:02:55] You can break the lines of genetic
[1:02:56] diseases. Amen. In the name of Jesus. If
[1:02:59] your father suffered from cancer doesn't
[1:03:01] mean you have to suffer from cancer. If
[1:03:03] your father suffered from heart disease
[1:03:05] doesn't mean you have to suffer from
[1:03:06] heart disease. Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Why do you think the first thing the
[1:03:09] doctor asked you was there a history of
[1:03:11] this in your family?
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; They are trying to connect you with
[1:03:14] generational diseases with generational
[1:03:16] curses.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; And you're like a humble lamb say yes.
[1:03:20] My father was a diabetic. You know what
[1:03:23] you're doing? Opening up doors
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; for spirits to come through.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; If you realize who you are in this time
[1:03:29] and season,
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; you don't have to lie.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Because your father
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; is not your earthly father. My father is
[1:03:37] God. So you tell the doctor, "My father
[1:03:40] has never had cancer. My father has
[1:03:42] never had heart disease. My father has
[1:03:44] never had sugar diabetes. My father has
[1:03:46] never had high blood pressure."
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; My father is God.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right there. Refuse to sign for
[1:03:55] any sickness.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Refuse to sign for any disease.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we bring this to a close now.
[1:04:06] Amen.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we are finding. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:04:10] If we get to that message, the second
[1:04:11] seal, you'll see that paragraph 284, he
[1:04:14] says when this council is held, I'm
[1:04:15] closing now. Amen. He says, watch, I'm
[1:04:18] talking about now they're trying to
[1:04:19] bring about powers to unite.
[1:04:23] Amen. We're talking about divine power,
[1:04:25] right? But I'm paralleling now with
[1:04:27] these earthly powers, demonic powers. He
[1:04:30] says the council was held. They elected
[1:04:32] the headbishop. By doing this, they
[1:04:34] united church and stayed together. What
[1:04:36] is it? Two powers coming together.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Then he dropped his bow. He got off his
[1:04:42] white horse. He got off his red horse.
[1:04:45] For he can kill anybody that don't agree
[1:04:47] with him.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; There is your seal. Same fellow. Watch
[1:04:50] him ride on into eternity yonder with
[1:04:52] it. See unites both his powers together.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:01] Now you say,
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; "What has it got to do with anything?"
[1:05:04] Don't you know he's an impersonator?
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Don't you know Satan is a copycat?
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; If he is uniting powers together,
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; what do you think the church of the
[1:05:15] living God has been doing?
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; There's been four powers, amen, around
[1:05:20] the throne.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; The power of the lion,
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; the power of the hawks,
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; the power of the man, and the power of
[1:05:26] the flying eagle.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. As Satan was hopping horses, these
[1:05:30] powers were uniting and moving on from
[1:05:32] the lion to the ox, from the ox to the
[1:05:35] man, and from the man right now into the
[1:05:37] age of that flying eagle.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Uniting the power of the revealed word
[1:05:44] for the power of the spoken word. I come
[1:05:47] on somebody hear what I just said.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; All of us are rejoicing under the power
[1:05:52] of the revealed word. Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; We need to take it and translate it from
[1:05:56] the revealed word to the spoken word
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; because the spoken word is the original
[1:06:01] seed. We all can rejoice with the
[1:06:03] revealed word. But we need to translate
[1:06:05] the revealed word to the spoken word.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is uniting both the
[1:06:11] mechanics and the dynamics.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; The power of the mechanics and the power
[1:06:15] of the dynamics to create an unstoppable
[1:06:18] power in his people.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; For too long, we've had just the
[1:06:21] mechanics. The mechanics, the mechanics,
[1:06:24] but God wants to unite the mechanics
[1:06:26] with the dynamics.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Re your revelation is the power
[1:06:32] that makes you invincible. Now, you
[1:06:34] can't buy revelation. I can't send you
[1:06:36] to the shop and tell you buy revelation.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; You can't go to any seminary to get
[1:06:41] revelation.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't inherit revelation.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Your father can't give you revelation.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Your mother can't give you revelation.
[1:06:50] You can't give it to your children.
[1:06:51] Amen.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood can't give you
[1:06:53] revelation, Jesus said.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And neither can you
[1:06:57] manufacture revelation.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; You can't manufacture revelation to
[1:07:03] defeat the enemy. You yourself have got
[1:07:05] to have a revelation.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And also, it's not a group
[1:07:11] revelation.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; It's an individual revelation.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And the father loves
[1:07:18] you and he wants to reveal himself to
[1:07:19] you. Amen.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, divine power lays
[1:07:22] in the word of God. How many of you
[1:07:24] believe that?
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Divine power is laying in the word of
[1:07:26] God.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; But don't just let it lay in the word of
[1:07:29] God.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; This word is like a stone that David
[1:07:31] took.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; The word is like the stone that David
[1:07:37] took.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; But David needed something to propel the
[1:07:40] stone.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Hey, come on.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; The word can lay dormant.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; But it needs a slingshot.
[1:07:49] What's the slingshot?
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. David picked up the stone. He
[1:07:53] picked up the word. A lot of us are
[1:07:55] picking up the word.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; But we don't know what to do with the
[1:07:58] stone.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. The enemy is watching you pick up
[1:08:02] the stone.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; You picked up the stone. You got the
[1:08:05] word. You got the word. You got the
[1:08:06] word. But you don't know what to do with
[1:08:08] the word.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; But the prophet says the bride has the
[1:08:11] mind of Christ and she knows what he
[1:08:13] wants done with the word.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; So what did he do? David picks up the
[1:08:17] stone. We are picking up the word. Amen.
[1:08:19] And we are putting it in the mouth of
[1:08:21] our slingshot.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; The slingshot is our mouth.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; The mouth of faith.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; You go to a sick baby. By the stripes of
[1:08:36] Jesus, you are healed.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; That baby will never get healed if no
[1:08:41] words are spoken. Is somebody hearing
[1:08:43] what I'm saying? You are letting the
[1:08:45] sick to lay. You are letting the lame to
[1:08:48] lay. You are letting the blind to lay
[1:08:50] because you are afraid to speak the word
[1:08:52] over a situation.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Why is it in 2025 we don't see people
[1:09:00] who are saying hey
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; speak a word.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Why is it we we we are saying these
[1:09:07] signs shall follow them that believe?
[1:09:09] Where are the rugged sons and daughters
[1:09:10] of God?
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; When are we going to be manifested?
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. We go everywhere telling everyone
[1:09:15] we got revealed word, revealed word.
[1:09:17] People don't want to see revealed word.
[1:09:19] They want to see manifested word.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; I can't keep preaching to you Jesus
[1:09:24] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:09:25] forever. And people are blind going out
[1:09:27] of here. People are sick going out of
[1:09:29] here. I must be able to stand with the
[1:09:30] authority of God and say even now come
[1:09:33] right here and watch the power of God
[1:09:35] heal you from your sickness, from your
[1:09:37] disease, from your infirmity, from all
[1:09:40] circumstances.
[1:09:43] Father,
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; we got too many people exciting the
[1:09:46] crowd.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; They are preaching Jesus Christ is the
[1:09:49] same yesterday, today, and forever. But
[1:09:50] they will never pray for you.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; They will never prove it.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; I say we expose it.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Romans 10.
[1:10:04] Prove it in the scripture now.
[1:10:07] So you put the word in your mouth and
[1:10:10] you pull it back
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; and you release the word.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Release the word. Speak it by faith.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Here's a scripture. But what say it? The
[1:10:20] word is nye even in your
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; even in your bookshelf.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; The word is ny even in thy
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; mouth
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; and in thy.
[1:10:34] That is the word of faith.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Which we preach. Now remember it's faith
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; right? The word we are speaking
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; here how you use it. If you confess with
[1:10:45] your
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; it must be a physical confession.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Don't go around telling everyone you're
[1:10:52] broke.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; That's what you're speaking over your
[1:10:59] life.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Your word is neither even in thy mouth.
[1:11:03] How can you be broke when you're going
[1:11:05] there and you're reading now in the
[1:11:07] stone? My father owns a kettle on a
[1:11:10] thousand years.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Uh my God shall supply all my needs
[1:11:20] according to his riches in glory. But
[1:11:23] you're telling everyone you're broke.
[1:11:25] You tell everyone you're a brokie.
[1:11:30] If thou shalt confess with thy mouth,
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; don't somebody ask you what you're doing
[1:11:36] and you're not working, don't even tell
[1:11:37] them you're unemployed.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Tell them I'm in the Even if you don't
[1:11:42] want to lie to them, tell them I'm in
[1:11:43] the process of attaining the job of my
[1:11:45] dreams.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Is that not what you're in the process
[1:11:52] of doing?
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Why are you telling everyone you're
[1:11:54] unemployed?
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Because you are confessing something.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Some people are very smart. They say,
[1:12:03] "I'm in between positions."
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; So, you confess with your mouth over
[1:12:11] your situation
[1:12:13] and believe in that.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; You can tie that in Mark 11:23. Read it
[1:12:19] when you go home. Confess with your
[1:12:21] mouth. Believe in your heart that God
[1:12:24] had raised him from the dead and thou
[1:12:26] shalt be saved. Now, this is pertaining
[1:12:28] to salvation. You confess with your
[1:12:30] mouth, believe in your heart, you shall
[1:12:32] be saved. But what in case you needed it
[1:12:34] for sickness?
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; You can confess with your mouth, believe
[1:12:38] in your heart, and you shall be healed.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; What if you need it over your marriage?
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; You can confess with your mouth, believe
[1:12:45] in your heart, and your marriage
[1:12:46] restored.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; What if you need it for finances? You
[1:12:50] can believe in your confess in your
[1:12:52] mouth, believe in your heart.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; And your finances will be healed.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:00] I know a lot of a lot of people think
[1:13:02] can't be can't be right now. Why don't
[1:13:03] you get rid of doubt?
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; You tried every other thing and failed.
[1:13:06] Why don't you try this?
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Take the word of God and believe it.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Right now. Amen. People may be at a
[1:13:15] crossroads and things are not working
[1:13:16] out. I'm telling you, use the word as a
[1:13:18] power.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Divine power is in the word of God.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh I think we got
[1:13:24] to leave it here now. Maybe we'll
[1:13:25] continue Wednesday. Tell your neighbor,
[1:13:27] I'll see you Wednesday.
[1:13:28] for part two.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Hey, come on now. Talk to your neighbor.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. Come on. Put them on
[1:13:34] notice. Why are you feeling shy? Tell
[1:13:37] them I'll see you on Wednesday for part
[1:13:38] two.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; See, after I'm not talking because they
[1:13:43] themselves are not coming Wednesday.
[1:13:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; If you're coming Wednesday, let's stand
[1:13:49] together.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Hey, brother. Josh, turn around and see.
[1:14:01] Everyone standing.
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Let me be honest with you. If I had
[1:14:12] enough money, I would try and help you.
[1:14:14] If I had enough money to buy houses, I'd
[1:14:16] give you a house. I'd give you a car.
[1:14:17] Try to make you live as comfortably as
[1:14:19] possible. But I can only give you what I
[1:14:21] have.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Which is the word of God.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; It's divine power to pull you out of any
[1:14:27] situation.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; In fact, right now, use the word that's
[1:14:30] been spoken and speak over you. You
[1:14:32] yourself know the situation you're going
[1:14:33] through right now. Let's play some
[1:14:34] music. Amen. You yourself know the
[1:14:37] situation you're going through right
[1:14:38] now.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; You know what situation your family's
[1:14:41] going through, your loved ones.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; You possess a divine power within you.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Now, stop that thing and and stop saying
[1:14:50] that you prayed over this many times and
[1:14:51] nothing happened.
[1:14:55] Speak right now over your situation.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; If your problem is standing next to you,
[1:15:01] lay hands on your problem right now.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not joking.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; If the problem or the situation is next
[1:15:09] to you,
[1:15:11] maybe you know your mother is sick, your
[1:15:13] father is sick, your son or daughter is
[1:15:15] sick. I'm asking you to operate the
[1:15:18] power. I don't want to just talk about
[1:15:20] something.
[1:15:22] I'm asking you to operate the divine
[1:15:24] power that's within you.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; And right now you can tell the Lord if
[1:15:27] that man is telling me the truth.
[1:15:30] And right now the divine power is laying
[1:15:32] within me.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; I'm taking you at your word.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Prove to me the divine power is within
[1:15:37] me. Is somebody hearing me?
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not running away from what I am
[1:15:42] preaching.
[1:15:43] I'm telling you, put God, speak to God
[1:15:47] right now
[1:15:48] [Music]
[1:15:51] and tell him
[1:15:53] if what that pastor is saying is true,
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; let me see your power right now.
[1:16:01] Lift me out of my situation.
[1:16:05] Lift me out of my situation.
[1:16:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:16:13] [Music]
[1:16:17] Hallelujah.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:24] Glory be to his name.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. While the music is playing, I want
[1:16:30] you to start to speak over your
[1:16:32] situation.
[1:16:34] You say, "Pastor, pray for me." No. I
[1:16:36] want to show you the divine power is in
[1:16:37] you.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Pastor, pray for me. Oh, you pray right
[1:16:41] now.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory,
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; glory, glory.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Glory. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Let's just start to pray. Father, we
[1:16:59] thank you, Lord Jesus,
[1:17:01] for your word, oh God.
[1:17:05] We thank you, Lord, that divine power
[1:17:07] lays in the believer.
[1:17:09] You've character molded us. Your
[1:17:10] character shaped us.
[1:17:13] We are reflecting your nature and your
[1:17:15] character even now.
[1:17:18] Father, unlock that potential right now.
[1:17:20] Father, I stand here, Lord. And I pray,
[1:17:22] Lord, release the power. Your people may
[1:17:25] be believing you right now and they need
[1:17:27] to see the evidence of it right now.
[1:17:28] Father, I pray, Lord, they will speak
[1:17:31] over their situation, over their
[1:17:33] problem, over their trial right now. And
[1:17:36] father, word will be released through
[1:17:38] their lips. Oh God, they'll believe in
[1:17:40] their heart and they shall receive that
[1:17:42] which they have asked for.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray Lord your word will not
[1:17:48] return void to them even now.
[1:17:51] Father, I pray right now, Lord Jesus,
[1:17:53] that
[1:17:55] the word, oh God, will leave their lips,
[1:17:57] penetrate atmospheres, tear down
[1:17:59] strongholds, change situations, change
[1:18:02] circumstances, heal sickness, and heal
[1:18:05] disease. Bring back the lost loved ones.
[1:18:07] Whatsoever words have been coming out
[1:18:09] their mouths. Lord, I'm fueling it with
[1:18:11] the power of your word. I'm fueling it,
[1:18:13] Lord, with the power of agreement, oh
[1:18:15] God. If two shall agree upon touching
[1:18:17] anything, they shall have what they have
[1:18:19] asked for. So I speak oh God and I say
[1:18:21] Lord I give it to them according to as
[1:18:23] they have requested in Jesus name.
