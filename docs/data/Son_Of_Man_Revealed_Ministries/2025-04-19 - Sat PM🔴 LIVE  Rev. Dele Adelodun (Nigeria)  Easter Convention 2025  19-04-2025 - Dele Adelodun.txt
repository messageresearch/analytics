We thank you for the blessings that we have received from you because we know you are an inexhaustible fountain. We have come for more again tonight. Amen. I pray for a yielding on my part and on the part of your audience. And Lord, you will give grace to the auction to the preacher and grace to the hearer. Please come out from the pages of your holy word and reveal thyself to us individually. Help us to see what you have done for us. And may you raise our faith to such a level.

All the sacrifices that they have made, oh God. To make these meetings, oh possible under your grace. Lord, may they never lose their reward. One more time, may you move through the audience of your people. May you stop at the post of each personal. Please discern their needs and grant to them the substance of their requests. Grant their desires. Almighty God, visit them like never before. Glory to the lives of your children. We are asking for other places where believers are gathered both in the country here and in other parts of the world that your presence will abide with your people. May the God of Easter bring a quickening to everything that the winters of life had frozen. Oh God, that Lord your sunrise will to them and give us life. Do it Lord. Let it be a season like never before. A season that we shall have that testimony from that time. Grant it to your people. You know their needs. I don't know. But Lord, I pray that you will give me such a yielding that through my vessel, you will speak to the needs of your people, and you will bless them there, Father. If there be souls that are still on their way, may you guide their paths. Amen. Amen. those that are in their houses, may you give them a quickening. Prepare the art of those that are here. At the end of all things, we will we give you glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. [Applause] The Lord bless you, saints. The Lord bless you. Amen. That sounds better. Hallelujah. The Lord bless you. Amen. Hallelujah. Yeah. Saying God bless you must not get common. Amen. Not to elicit our Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. When we say it, we mean it from our heart. When you amen it, the blessings of God will be yours. You know, there was one of the new year's messages. The prophet said, I wouldn't say happy new year. Yeah. He said I mean not that he's against it is but I will say God bless you. He said because if God bless you the happiness of the new year and every other thing is inside that bless you. So that statement holds holds a lot for us. Amen. And may God bless you richly. Amen. Amen. All right. Not to keep you standing, I will humbly request that we read our Bible. Amen. We are still in our subject when the Lord said it is finished. Amen. I hope we can maybe we can run that up tonight and see. No, we'll still be in it in a way. All right, let's just leave there. All right. John chapter 19. Yes. For tonight, we're going to read those other accounts a little because we were going to the third aspect of when the Lord said, "It is finished." We have looked at the the veil of the temple. Amen. And then we looked at it very well. We also looked a bit into the lampstanding. Yes. To make redemption claims. Amen. So we want to see the graves of the saints being open tonight. Amen. So John chapter 19 verse [Music] 3030 And when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished." and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost. Amen. Amen. Matthew chapter 27. Matthew 27. The account of Matthew 27 and Mark 15 are the same. So let's take it from Matthew 27:E1 15. Jesus when he had cried with a loud voice yielded up the ghost. And behold the veil of the temple was rent into him from the top to the bottom. And the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened. And many bodies of the saints which left arose. and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many. Amen. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of his holy word. God bless you. You may please be seated. [Music] Once again, I would like to appreciate uh the servants of God uh who are host in this meetings and uh and all the other servants of God who are also supported. I pray that the Lord bless you, bless your ministries and uh with the kind of response we have received from the saints, it shows you have done a very mighty work. So it makes it easy to preach to your congregation. I pray that the Lord will continue to enrich your ministries in the name of Jesus Christ. I also appreciate all the saints who have been coming to the meetings. I know it takes a lot of sacrifice for you to do all that you are doing and I pray that the Lord will richly reward your sacrifice and your effort in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. So tonight we are still on when the Lord said it is finished. Amen. Amen. Amen. But we want to look at the third aspect. I told us at the beginning of the study yesterday morning that when the Lord said it is finished uh three things happened. Amen. Amen. And uh the gospels gave us account of two of those three things and also the revelation of the loud voice. Amen. But if you go further in the book of Revelation, it gave us the account of the third thing. The third thing that happened took place in heaven. Then one took place on the earth and the other took place beneath the earth. So the uh the that voice when the Lord when it is finished Yes. actually affected several dimensions and uh it meant different things to different people. Amen. And uh it took care of the past. It took care of the present and it has also taken care of the future. So the bride is permanently secure. We have nothing to be afraid of. We on the Lord's side. So we want to look a bit into the past that was taken care of. Amen. This evening. Amen. Now along the study I told us that all the saints who died before Christ came couldn't go into the presence of God. Yes. Because they lived under the blood of bulls and goats which cannot do a work of remittance. Amen. But the blood only did a job of covering. But when you cover something is still there. You cover what is existing. But the the real the real payment will be something to take it away. Because really it must not be there and what we are talking about here is the sins of the people. Okay. And the prophet of the Lord told us that sin must be judged. Then for sin to be judged, it must be placed on the person. Amen. Amen. And that was why it was necessary for the perfect land. Yes. To come and pay that penalty. Amen. And then we told us that he did not only pay, he became our sin so that we can become his righteousness. Hallelujah. That was why our sin was judged in his body and by his payment he broke the chemical compound of sin and sent it back to where it came from. To send it back to where it come from, we shall see this evening. The prophet said there must be a barrier. Hallelujah. And he took that back to Romans chapter 6. That when we accept the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. Amen. We go for water baptism. Amen. Which Jesus our Lord told us that water baptism brings remission. Amen. Why it's able to bring remission is because it it water baptism involves burial. Amen. That is why Paul said as we are buried in the likeness of his death. Are you following? The burial in the likeness of his death means the taking away of our sins. Amen. Amen. So as we are buried in the likeness of his death, so when we are raised from the water, we are raised in the likeness of his resurrection. So that process also speak of death, burial and resurrection. Amen. We must be ready to die to ourselves. We must be ready to die to sin. None of us can deliver ourselves from sin or any other. That is why God does not want you to live a life of struggle. He has not asked any man to fight to overcome sin. If somebody tells you that they've misplaced the gospel, what God needs from you is the readiness in your heart. If thou will, are you willing tonight? If this is the readiness in your heart, he will take it off from there. Because the power to overcome sin belongs to God alone. So he That's why the prophet said, "Don't struggle to be a Christian." And I have another quotation where he said, "Don't struggle to quit anything." He said, "I'm struggling to quit my smoking. I'm struggling to quit my dirty life. As long as you are struggling, you will never overcome. That battle is beyond you. Don't struggle to do it." He said what you need to do is to accept what he has done that it is meant for me and believe it. He said then as you believe more of God enters and as God enters it gives quick notice. It's a gradual experience or it is a sure experience. But you will definitely celebrate. He would definitely testify. That is why my brother, my sister, no matter how bad you feel you are. Don't stop coming to church. You will never get any better outside of the church. Come to church in good times. Come to church in bad times. If you are rising and falling, come to church. The church is God's clinic. is not meant only for the healthy. He's meant for the sick. Hallelujah. Amen. Those who are healthy will find edification. Those who are sick will find healing. They will find deliverance. They will find breakthrough. I tell you that woman at the well whose name we don't know, the Saman woman was always in church. despite a poor condition. You say, "How do you know?" When Isaiah came our way and did the display of the Messiah, did you hear what she said? She said, "They told us that when Messiah come, this is what he shall do." They told us, who told her? She was coming to church, faith cometh by hearing, hearing the word of God. And she believed what they told her. And she was always in church despite her condition. And one day, hallelujah. She had an encounter with the God of the church. Hallelujah. You know, you know that man that they pulled Bethesda for 37 years or so or was it 41? You know the number of years. 38 years. Thank you. He was always there. He never left the place. And for 38 years he failed. He said, "Anytime I want to get into the water, another person gets in before me." But he kept faith. If it doesn't happen today, it's going to happen tomorrow. And one day the angel who trles the water came in person seeing his dedication and he said brother will thou be made whole. You will have that one day encounter and it will be like it never before. Congressman Hobshaw was going to church for 60 something years. He never failed. His faith kept rising. Hallelujah. Every day, every week, every month, every year and devotion for 60 something years. Hallelujah. Can I tell you his day came and your day will come. Church is good for sick people. Sin sick, disease sick, sickness sick. So come to church. You are better of inside than outside. [Applause] God bless you. God bless you. All right. You love him tonight. [Applause] Okay. So if I keep going this way, the Lord will help us. All right. I want to focus on tonight. But I think it's part of it also. So don't struggle to quit anything. Just only believe. The Lord will take care of you. When when when when you are ready, God is ready. He said a broken and a contrite spirit the Lord will not despise. That is all he needs from you. Many a time we don't get it because we are not contrite enough. Amen. Some of us come at the spore of the moment. Oh my friend is coming to the altar. I must do something about it. No. God must touch you individually. It must be personal experience. Some of us come still with a regret of the wages of iniquity that we are going to be separated from. So I won't enjoy this again. So I won't enjoy this again. As long as you come with such regret, you won't encounter God. Your mouth and your heart must be in agreement. Not beyond your mouth. God sees your heart. So no matter what you claim, he sees who you are. But if your heart and your mouth get together, a broken and a contrite spirit, God will not dispatch. God becomes obligated when you truly repented and take his name in water baptism. He becomes obligated to fill you with the Holy Ghost. You love him this evening. Praise God. Amen. So there must be a barrier. Amen. And uh but let me start like this. The Bible told us he said when he said it is finished, one of the effects was the dimension below which was the quickening of the graves. Amen. Amen. But I want to quickly say this, brethren, the graves that were quipped and opened were just of those who died. In the hope of the coming Christ [Music] wonderful. It wasn't the grave of everybody. That's right. How meticulous could God bring be to distinctively Hallelujah pick up the graves that are meant for resurrection think about that a little that same just God is still here tonight friends we may come as a family even as a group to the house of the Lord But our dealing with God or God's dealing with us is individual. [Applause] This is why your attention must not be on anyone but on Christ. [Applause] Friendship and association is handed outside. When we come here, you must know what you come for. [Applause] And don't be busy with no other person. Because perhaps you don't know what they came for. [Music] Amen. Because even to the grave, Yes. God marked the grave of those who were waiting, who died, who lived, who did everything in the hope of the coming Christ. So I want to say this first. Yes. That it wasn't every grave that quipped and open. Some remain dead cold starting, winter and permanent. They will come up sometime but not dead. Amen. Pick every statement because we're going to take God out of history. We're going to bring into present tense. Amen. If the Bible is only a book of history, we are wasting our time here. But we shall see how this is going to play itself back in this last days. Amen. Amen. Whose graves were this. Now these people themselves they knew where resurrection and rapture will take place. Yes. Amen. Let me say this church, resurrection and rapture has always had its location. Amen. Amen. Amen. Yes. The one I'm talking about and we divide them very soon. But the one I'm talking about has its location. It wouldn't take place everywhere. Some of these saints lived in Egypt. [Music] They lived the best of their years in Egypt. Somebody like Joseph lived all his adult years in Egypt. He became so successful in Egypt. But he remained not an Egyptian. [Applause] Hallelujah. It must have been a disservice to the citizenship of Egypt when Joseph told his brethren, I know that the Lord will surely visit you as he promised. Because the promise he gave to Abraham by covenant in Genesis 15 became a generational heritage. Amen. Yes. It was passed on generation to generation. Amen. that they will indeed so join in the land that is not here. But the Lord will bring them out with a mighty hand to the land he has given to them for a possession. That land he held a lot both for those who were living and those who were dead. Amen. That was why Joseph said, "I know the Lord will surely visit you in that visitation. No matter how busy preient or how urgent your journey is, make sure you don't leave my bones here. Hallelujah. So for many numbers of years, the bones of Joseph was never buried. Yeah. And the prophet said it became a symbol of hope, a symbol of the promised visitation, to every Israelites that no matter what they are going through in the hands of the tax masters when they look at the bones of Joseph Monday, there will be a visitation. Oh, what a blessed hope we have. Hallelujah. Do you know it was so important to Jacob? Yes. Until he made his sons to swear to him. Serious business you think. And I tell you serious business. He told them he said, "I'm going the way of all her." Yes. And I shall soon be gathered to my people. Yes. But make sure you don't bury my body. Excuse me. Come swear to me that you won't do it. Joseph must have said papa I believe what I will do. Let's make it a to understood the seriousness. You know why those folks had great revelation of what of where resurrection and rapture will take place. Amen. Hallelujah. Let me tell you resurrection and rapture also as it location today. Hallelujah. [Applause] Okay. To help you, let me divide it for you. There are two resurrections coming. And I want you to know the one I'm saying for very for clarity. I will put it like this. There's going to be a better resurrection. Amen. I'm using the language of the scripture. Yes. And there's a resurrection. Maybe we can call good for some, bad for some. When the Bible spoke in Hebrews 11, he called a resurrection a better one. To me as if I'm speaking straight. Now the better resurrection is the one I'm talking about. Amen. Usually in English language, you start from good, better, best. But in spiritual language, God always start from the best. Hallelujah. So is best better good or since we are comparing between just two things here by the use of the word better this better one will come first and the good or the bad depending on the side people are will come later this better one I'm talking about is going to be the first resurrection but I want to say tonight it's going to have its location Amen. The universality of the resurrection and rapture in the first has to speak with you know certain people. Amen. Amen. Who are scattered all over the earth. That is the only universality. But this rapture, this resurrection and rapture is not going to happen to everybody. It's only the same people who shared the same thing. who lives in the same place, who eats the same food wherever they are, even if they are buried in the sea, it's only those ones that will come up because rapture, the first one, resurrection and rapture at location. As a matter of fact, the second one has no rapture. Yes, that's right. Amen. The second resurrection has no rapture. The first one is the one that has rapture. Glory. Hallelujah. Wonderful. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And this resurrection is called better because it has some benefits that the other one does not have. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This resurrection I'm talking about as rapture. Amen. That's one. As wedding supper. Two. As the millennium. Three. Gives you the privilege of sitting as a judge. Yes. In the white throne judgment. And when eternity rolls in, you have eternal residency inside the first city. [Applause] Whoever does not make it in that resurrection or that body change or that rapture will miss all those five benefits. [Music] That is the word, brother. So when the Bible call it a better resurrection in Hebrews 11, the Bible knew what he was talking about. Hallelujah. Brother Abraham said, "I'm a daily riser." He said, "So I will come up in the flesh." [Music] God bless my people. See what they wrote there. Women received their dead breast to life again and others were tortured. not accepting deliverance that they might obtain what better a better. So if there's a better resurrection that means the scripture is comparing between two resurrections. Are you catching it? Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. For you to be in that better resurrection and if you are alive in that body change experience, you've got to be located [Applause] somewhere because the Bible type shows that rapture, resurrection never took place anywhere else. Amen. other than in the promised land. Yes, that's right. Glory to God. It was completely localized. That was why Israel and Abraham and all the rest refused to be buried elsewhere. Tell me where resurrection was going to take place. Hallelujah. Amen. And friends, refuse to live elsewhere. refuse to be buried elsewhere because in these last days resurrection and rapture is also going to be localized. I say it with all sense of responsibility. Hallelujah. Amen. If you miss the location, you go nowhere. In first Thessalonians chapter 4, Amen. The Bible says the Lord will descend. That's right. Giving three things. Shout. Voice. Trumpet. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Voice is connected to resurrection. Yes. Of the sleeping saints. Is that right? Amen. But the shout prepares the living. [Applause] That's right. So if while you are leaving you miss the shout, how would you get the voice? Are you seeing the location? Because the shout is what give you an evidence, a vindication that you have been chosen as a bride. And it is the shout that gosp to put you in marriage. I said marriage. I give marriage. The marriage takes place here. [Music] They shall put you in marriage to your bridegroom so that both of you will change status from bride to wife and from bridegroom to husband. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This is where we can rejoice as the spiritual intercourse that is given unto you is pleasurable to you. Anytime you come to the house of the Lord, what are you receiving? Seeds of your husband. In order to bring forth. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. How can you miss that? and you leave and expect to come up. It's not possible. [Applause] You love him. You got to be wife to him here. This is why Revelations 10 8 to 11 says you must prophesy. Do you know what that means? Amen. The testimony of Jesus Christ is a spirit of prophecy. You must give an evidence. You must produce Christ on two feet. Life of his life, power of his power, work of his word, of his. She is the same scripture that applies for him. Yeah. Is now applied to you. [Music] [Applause] I wish we could talk. Okay, maybe tomorrow will come into your own personal instant. Amen. Because you must see what this message has done for you. It is what was waved over you to give you your own resurrection that will give you your own body change. [Applause] Hallelujah. So you can't miss the shout and get the voice. Hallelujah. And if you miss the voice, you can't be gathered by the trumpet. For your solar page, you know, for for Enoch, all the Bible told was Enoch walked with God. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So there must be a walk with God. Before you will not be seen. It's a daily continuous walk with God. Until one day you will step onto the king's highway and gravitation will lose hope. Then we shall disprove science that says whatever goes on must come down. We will answer is no. If we go up, we will only come down when we are ready. Because gravitation will lose hold on certain people. Yes sir. But you must be found on the right ground. Amen. Amen. Amen. That's right. You see why you must come out of loud this year. Are you seeing the blending? Yes. Lesia holds nothing for you. Blind, wretched, miserable, naked and as long as you leave him there. No rapture. Pentecostals are in love this year. The church world is in love this year. But something called us out of now. The message of the home, the reveal work, the temple. The opening of the seals put us into a junction that condition no longer help us and we have come out [Applause] into the age of the bride where all things are possible. We have holiness is not a place. It's a way of laughing because the message we hear the season of holy decency the secret place of the most high. How do you expect to leave Egypt if you were not in ghost? Come on church. Show me your time. Hallelujah. You didn't believe in go. You didn't believe go message goian has it message. Go was different from Egypt. Go ask the pillar of fire. Amen. They don't dispute the pillar of fire in they don't doubt the pillar of cloud in G. Yeah, as the blood of the atonement, the Passover lamb, caution at the messenger, and by that question at the work, for the hour, Egypt had none of it. You stay in Egypt, you die. You live in motion, you are delivered. We have come to portion of this house. Amen. In the evening time, it shall be light. Yes, there was darkness in Egypt, but there was light in God. The conditions were not the same at the hour of Exodus. We are nearing another living. Another going home and the conditions can no longer be the same. Amen. The church must die. You know why they said they will die? The church is dead. Yes. The absence of life gives death. They push out Christ. Laia rejected Christ. Christ was standing outside. Isn't that what the scripture said? He was standing outside. Life was outside. Light was outside. Uh-huh. And from his body language and his expression, he wasn't willing to come in. He said, "Behold, I stand." Amen. He wasn't willing to come in to bring revival and dispensational salvation again. But he began to call to individuals. [Applause] Hallelujah. So you were once locked in that prison house. Amen. But the word of the Lord came to you to call you out of the prison house of death. Amen. When he called you out, he brought into an economy where the council of God is ruling. That is the age of the bride. This is the economy where we are. Amen. That is why our life is transformed. We enjoyed only one thing here. spiritual food in season which gives us access to everything we have need of even when the doctors have failed we can still get our healing amen everything we need that we ever need is right in here [Applause] glory to God so these folks who were looking up to it Amen Amen. They live so well in that hope. If you read, if you read Hebrews 11, it says something tells them that there's a city somewhere who's builder, and maker is God. Simple scripture. And because that thing was registered in their hearts, they professed to be what? Piggy and strangers. A lot of them were wealthy, but they never lived by their wealth. Amen. They lived by the hope of the coming Christ. What they heard and what they do not have never bothered them. Amen. Because they've received a bear of great prize. Yes, sir. Glory to pilgrims don't dig deep in the land of their pilgrimage. Yes. That was why they were living in tents. Something that is easily removable. Yes. Because when they move, they move. Glory. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. They evidently proved Yes. that their comfort did not reside here. Hallelujah. Amen. And they were so happy to tell anybody the hope that is in them. Yes. I'm a pilgrim and a stranger. Wandering through this world of sin. On my way. Friends, let's live like that. Even if you drive the best car, live like that. If you live in the best house, live like that. Your life is not established upon your wealth is established upon the sure foundation of eternal life. That is why said what can separate us from the love of God from riches to want. They said no in all these things we are more than conquerors. Let that be your experience friends. Amen. When things are getting so fine with you, don't abandon God. Before you got the job, we were praying for you. If the job now takes you away from service and is making a mess out of our lives, the church has the power to lose and to buy because we love your soul. We pray against the church. [Applause] Because for belly, belly for food will have an end one day. But there is something deep down in a man. Amen. And that is where the resides the place of eternal life. Amen. You love him tonight. So these folks were looking forward. It never happened in their day. That was why they died in the hope. Yes. Of the coming Christ. And I tell you, Christ never disappointed them. And he will never disappoint us. Our Lord is coming back to this earth again. [Music] Amen. Satan will be bound a thousand years and we shall have no temper there when our Lord will come back. Tell your son our Lord is coming back. Don't let anybody take away the hope of the coming crash. These folks died. Yeah, they never saw it happen. But they died in that hope and Christ never disappointed. Christ came and he will come again. He's a short one of promise. Hallelujah. There stood in Jerusalem. Yeah. And they were ging and two angels came back and said, "Ye men of Jerusalem and Judea, why standing gazing? Why are you looking hopeless and helpless? This same Jesus that is ascending. One more time we descend. I believe you with all my heart. Our Lord will come back to him. And he has started coming. [Music] Glory. He has started the climax of his coming will be his physical appearance even touch the ground. Amen. But it's going to magnetate. It's going to magnetize those with whom we share similar material. It's going to happen one of these things. It is the hope that we are not ashamed. The hope that which we comfort one another. [Applause] Amen. So this brethren died in that hope and it looked like everything gone uh you know went quiet. That's right. It looks like everything became hopeless. Do you know even when Christ came because of his burial Yes. the disciples became discomforted themselves. Hallelujah. Oh, the Bible is a true account. Peter decided to go back to fishes. The ones who went back to fishing were confused on the road to Emma. And you can see the way when Jesus, you know, filled himself and appeared to them. You can see the way they reported the resurrection story with a sense of detachment. That's right. Yeah. Because they were not sure. They said and to make to compound the problem, certain women of our company said they saw him. They couldn't hold up. They couldn't take ownership. That's right. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. You can see how it feels. Everything went quiet. Yes. And it was happening years upon years. Then we saw Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Amen. He came according to the scriptures. He did signs and wonders. He did everything to create faith in the people. To let them know that he was the one promised from the book of Genesis. He even told them to search the scriptures. Yes. In them they think they have eternal life. This is the thing that testify of me. Amen. Amen. They were struggling to believe him. Some have to wait till he died before they can even say, "Oh, indeed this is the son of God." Upon all those outstanding miracles, so if God makes you a believer, you should be thankful. Yeah, you should be grateful. It's election. It's predestination, not by power, not by night. It is the grace of God. [Music] That's right. The potter who has chosen to make you vessels of honor, not vessels of rot fitted for destruction. The vessels of rot cannot quary him. Amen. And the vessels of honor cannot appreciate him enough friends. He came as the scripture said of him and they went to the cross. We've gone through that already. He went into Gethsemane where you know the the the faith of the people of the past, the people in the present and those of the future, you and I, rested upon his decision. When he said, "Not my will, let their will be done." A few hours later, he was moved from the labor room of Gethsemane to the delivery room of of Calvary. Amen. Amen. And having completed the process of delivery and the process of dealing with sin once and for all. Not only with sin with the attribute of sin, death. Because it was sin that brought death. So when sin is killed, death is guilt. The prophet said the way to kill a vicious animal for you that are he said is not to him for the leg. your head. You know why? He has a chance of recovery. And if the animal recover recovers, you are in trouble. He said in order to paralyze its body, it's a h for the head. Amen. When you blow up the head, the entire body dies. So Christ a for the real thing. Amen. He dealt with sin. Yes. So the sin and all his attributes can be destroyed. When Apostle Paul caught the revelation of that dealing, he said, "Oh, oh gave way thy power. Oh death, where is thy st. Thanks be to God. Who gave us power? by Calvary. Everything you need and you will ever need was offered to you by Calvary. When he said it is finished, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When they pronounce that word, I'm focusing on this tonight. Among many things that we said happened that we've shown, there was a great earthquake. Amen. Yes. And the earthquake affected certain graves. Amen. Because the graves of the believers who died in the hope of the coming Christ was marked by Christ. Is still marked till tonight. Hallelujah. G. So all those m grapes went and they were opened. Amen. They were opened on Friday. That's what the Bible said. The occupants came out. It was symbolic. Amen. Because the real occupants were actually no longer there. That is why it was marked. Yes. This was where we put him. And on that spot, you will come again. Hallelujah. Amen. The occupants who were placed in those places came up. What you actually put there, listen to me, was the body in which they live. Yes. You cannot put a believer in the grave. Amen. Did you catch that? Wow. Because it is when the believer vacates that body Amen. [Music] That is why it says dust thou art to dust you return wasn't spoken of the soul. Yes. Amen. You will never hear the Bible say the body that sinnth shall die. It is the soul. Because that is your real you. [Applause] Amen. Amen. If you are a seed of God, that your real you can never be dissolved. It can never die. It's eternal. Hallelujah. If God help us to bring a personal Easter tomorrow, you will see your real you there. It's undiable. Amen. All right. The moment he vacates this body, it stepped into another. Yes. And live consciously. Do you hear me? All the saints who are gone, they are alive tonight. Hallelujah. And they live consciously by the scripture. They live consciously. By the message they live consciously. Hallelujah. Jesus said the rich man died and Lazarus died also. Amen. You use the word death language of the earth. But he said when both of them died, they woke up somewhere. And in the place where they woke up at, they were conscious. Simple explanation of Christ. Amen. The rich man was conscious of his suffering, of his poverty, Amen. in another dimension. Until he was begging for water. And Lazarus was conscious of his pleasure. Hallelujah. Not of my soul in the bosom of Abraham. Hallelujah. We were gracious to have a first time account from the prophet who went beyond the curtain of time. [Applause] He went into the region of the lost. Amen. And he went beyond the curtain of time. When his own wife passed, he wanted her so bad to come. But can you imagine as much as the prophet wanted sister to come back, God, you know, she was so caught, he was so caught up in sorrow that God did something unusual. That's right. He actually brought Hope back into the room. Yes. Amen. To have a conversation. Yes. With her husband. And in that conversation, hope wasn't ready to come back as much as he loved when he was already feeling the fortest of that place. He was rather trying to, you know, before she passed, he was ra, she was rather trying to get her husband to agree to [Applause] reignite. Hallelujah. This is a dimension like no other. And when she went into that realm being brought back to give comfort to her husband, she doesn't want to come. She told Bill, he said, "You preached about these things, but you have never entered into it. that stuck with bills for a long time. I preach it and never enter. He couldn't he couldn't put it together while the woman is so much loved would not want to come back to him. But years will tell several years later being matured, old and a solid Christian. Yes, he was thinking about the heavenlies. And God said, "Would you like to see beyond the mountain of time?" I said, "You have my faith." And he was placing his hands like this on the bed. And God said, "Okay, if you want it, get it." And sister was by the side. The sister and Mary after the first wife was by her side. And uh it said this experience was most remarkable. And he said why? Because in all the multitude of visions that he has ever had, yes, there was never a time he ever went out of his body. But this time around, he went out. He saw his body on the bed and he saw himself moving into another dimension. I don't know how to describe the body on the bed then maybe dead still or whatever it is but I'm glad the God asked to keep sister med asleep. Yes. Because if she woke up at that time and was tapping the husband, there would have been a commotion. Amen. And and the prophet went beyond the cotton of time. In a place where there was no there is no yesterday, there is no tomorrow. In a place where there is no old age, no sickness, he saw everybody. Even the people that he brought to the Lord at the age 80 someday then they saw them in the bloom of youth 18 year old. Indeed life at best is actually very brief. He saw them as 3:16. Amen. There was no clans of sensations. Everybody was just one and the same because they in another body. Everybody embracing each other. Welcome our precious brother. Welcome our precious brother. He was having the greatest time of his life and he couldn't explain it. And as that was going on. Amen. And you know the one who was guiding him was showing him. He said, "Look at that lady that you were married just ago. She was 91 years old when you led her to the Lord. And he said to think that this was what I was afraid of. Amen. And he said, "Okay, I've enjoyed the company of this wonderful people." Amen. This is my convert to the Lord. He said, "I want to see Jesus." And they told him, "Jesus is just a little bit high." You were in the 60s and the sevens, just a little bit higher. And exactly these folks are waiting for you to present them to Christ. Amen. He said really there's going to be a presentation time whether you like it or not. And I hope you like it. If you don't like it, there's no guarantee. I hope you like it. You will kill behind the prophet. [Applause] If you are counted, if you are counted as the jewel of Christ for this age, you will lie behind the prophet. Some are going to lie behind Paul. Some will do behind Peter, but you will land behind William. [Applause] [Music] Amen. Amen. And he said when the people uh of Peter have to go through the same say yes sir. When those of Paul have to go through the same say yes sir. Then he said there hallelujah in a theopernal body. In the body in which you know all things in the body in which you can never be deceived. Yeah. Because if any truth of the word strike an to you on earth, the prophet said is because you heard from your Did you catch that? So that's your guarantee protection from deception in that body in which you know all things. Hallelujah. He said, "If that is so, if the people of Peter make it, mine will make it." If the people of Paul make it, mine will make it. Because I preach what Peter preach. I preach what Paul preach. Not many preachers can say that. And all those believers in their view of body said on this we are resting. Let me tell you church heaven accepted this message. So it's too late for somebody attacking the rest. Too late. Too late for a time waster. You are the one of those girls who stood to quench the light of the fire of of the Statute of Liberty. You're going to beat your brains hard. The more you attack, the more the message is advancing. For everyone that is going to apostasy, God is bringing many. Baptism goes on every day because all sons of God who are dead to eternal life will come home. Every time this is the problem of God, God will see to his problem. Brother said as for opposition I don't I don't I don't deal with it. I don't even give it you know I don't glorify it with attention. He said because you know why God takes care of He's been taking care of it. He will continue to take care of it all the time. Hallelujah. Don't stress yourself. Just keep your own focus. You have nothing to reply to anybody. Let me tell you, it's ongoing time and everyone will find their way back to their origin. I don't know if it happens here. If you go to a rural area where you allow even your animals to grace freely, when the heing shadows begin to fall, what do they do? They start finding their way back to their owners house. None of them will go to a place where they never came out from in the morning. Everybody will know their houses. We have gone to the healing time and everybody will go to where they originated from. [Applause] Do you know why there be all kind around the message? Mind my language. Around not in. Do you know why there be all kind? Because this is the only light left. Yes. And every seed, whether good or bad, must interact with light in order to manufacture their food through the process of photosynthetics. Is that what they told us? So the grass needs sunlight. The mess need sunlight. The desirable plants need sunlight. The poisonous plants need sunlight. Yes. But when light strikes upon them, it's not going to change the seeds that they have from one to another, is only going to transform. They are only one seed from infancy to maturity. That is why every seed whether false or genuine needs the message of their heart. Let me tell you, Judas's scariot needed Jesus as much as Peter needed him because the dynamics of the true church and the false church is in the hand of only one man. So there's no problem in the message of the hour. There could be a lot of noise around the message, but inside the message is a certain sound. Do you hear me? The seal of God stand sure. The Lord knows those who are his. Let noise makers be making noise. Let attackers be attacked. They are only feeling the cup of their fathers. There are those who must be coral. There are those who must be. There are those who must be. And there are those who must be joyful. There are those who must be. Hallelujah. Every seed must turn to this message. So if you see amen, you must preach a message for 40 years and is now attacking the message. There is nothing out of place. It's just number. Every seed must come to roost. [Applause] You know Judas's scariot couldn't go to work until Jesus inspired him. He said who will betray? Who will do this? Who will do that? He said what? Wait, wait. Then he took his sword and gave him to do that. And by the time he took it, Jesus was the one who gave him. Underline that. By the time he took it, It gave him a search. It gave him an anointing. Gave him an inspiration. And Jesus sealed it. He said that which dwell. So the dynamics of the first church is in the hands of Jesus. The dynamics of the true church is in the hand of Jesus. [Applause] And the message of the hour is the Lord Jesus Christ. Ah, you got it now. So the benefit of the false brethren and the true brethren is in this message. All of them must interact with the message to manifest the character of the seed that is inside. That is God's power of transformation. [Applause] friends. The clock is ticking right. It's a pity people find themselves in that condition. But we are helpless, aren't we? Brother says, "Somebody must go that way." You know the prophet in the message of David of God, he said at times we need to say things. And we do it intentionally. So you got to pick forth in this message because that's what is needed to take care of you. It's intentionally done. Brother Brown said to pin down the crowd. He says some will hear it and ponder. Some will move out. And be a valley of decision in a compound whether to come back or to go away and some will stay alive and say Lord have mercy upon me. One statement, several reactions. You are reacting by the seed that you are. [Applause] and accepted his message. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That was you, brother. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So he said, I preach what preach I preach. I preach what Paul preach. And the believer said on this we are resting. Are you resting on it? Are you resting on it? He said if you stay by these things, I will meet you in the morning. is so certain there will be another victory after all that he's just feeling so good he couldn't explain it he said all he felt is wrong that was what defined perfect love to brother he understood it by experience then his guides told him excuse me sir It's time to go back. Brother said, "Go where?" You mean that we have to leave where I am? Uhhuh. I was waiting. Paul, Rebecca, Sarah, Joseph, tabernacle, the prophet was planning to leave and stay where he is. Those are love ones who have gone. If we could have an opportunity to speak to them and say come back, I tell you they're going to disappoint us. They they are feeling for you much more than you are feeling for them. Brother Brown did not want to come back. Ah say your time is you going to come back. Amen. So he came back with sadness. That was when he understood. What sister hope said, you only preached it. You've not experienced it. Hallelujah. Amen. So if we sorrow for the saints who are gone, is the sorrow of a momentary pattern. We didn't lose them. We're going to see them again. They die because they died in the hope of the coming grass. Listen, when the grave quake, the graves were opened. Amen. Amen. Amen. And when the graves were open, preparatory for what? Resurrection. Right. Yes. Jesus was buried. He had to be buried for them to come out. Ah, that is why the didn't come out on Good Friday. Amen. You didn't catch that. This is it. He has paid the price. I told you yesterday that he was both our lamp and our scapegoat. Yes. Amen. When a lamb or a goat is killed relative to sin. Yes. The blood of the dead, a goat or lamb is blessed upon another. Amen. Amen. is made and they will release that goat and he will run off far away into the wilderness which is a symbol of the death and the burial of our Lord Jesus Christ the burial was necessary to take your sins having met the requirement to remit them he's going to take them far way into the se of God's forgetfulness. Hallelujah. It's not I told you yesterday, it's not just going to create a bridge over the is going to preach it. He's going to close it completely. Amen. He's going to justify those people. Amen. Who it couldn't enter into the holiest of the holies, whose faith was not perfected, whose experience stood at the middle C. Yes. It became their perfection. The real high priest. Did you catch that? So before they could come out, there must be a barrier. The sins must be taken far away into the sea of God's forgetfulness. There were the sins who were taken far away. They were completely cleansed and separated right there. There was no more sin. We can apply the scripture of Romans 8 to them now that now there is therefore now no condemnation [Applause] they receive their perfect justification by the burial of Christ after he took it away he became qualified to go and get the key hallelujah all This was happening on a day like this. He died on Friday. And he was buried, right? And they took it far away. On a day like this was his atonement. Amen. It was in the grave. But I tell you, it was only the body that was there. Yes. The Bible said his soul, yes, having met the penalty for sin and take blocks sin away from mankind, he became qualified to be the captain of the salvation of the past, the present and the future. Hallelujah. And he will address them one after the other. Amen. Amen. So you know what it did? It came into the fifth dimension. The fifth dimension has three layers. The first layer spirit of unjust men. Amen. When people die, their spirits don't die. Yes. You understand? Amen. That is why I said if you say somebody's an arm robber and you have given him a capital punishment, you are killing him. Yes. Maybe hanging or shooting him. You are only killing the victim of armed robber. You cannot kill an arm robber. Amen. Some of you don't get it. That arm robber is a spirit. It's a demon. [Music] Hallelujah. His victim is the body was using to express manifest. Amen. That is why back home in the days of capital punishment that don't exist anymore. When we very small boys when they have sentence some real robbers to death, they will take them to the Atlantic Ocean beach. You have your beach here, right? What's the name of that ocean? Indian Ocean. Indian Ocean. All right. They will take them to the Atlantic Ocean and man stakes and in their thoughts they are saying everybody should come and watch how not to end so that if you are stealing you must quickly change your mind. So they will pump rifle right in the presence of all. But guess what? As they were doing that somebody shouting my phone, my money. Who took it? right there. So what did we actually kill? Who did we kill? As that spirit was leaving that body, he jumped on another person and he started operation right there and there to show to the government you are wasting your time. You have only killed your citizen. You can't kill me. That's right. Amen. Amen. Yes. Are you catching that? So those spirits, they are the first layers in the fifth dimension. So today, that is why we pray with knowledge. Yes. You hear people say Satan die. Demons die. Die by fire. Not wasting your time. Some of you enjoy prayer like this. That's right. Amen. You can kill no demon. Now even demons know that their torment is in the future. You remember the men of Gary. They ask Jesus, why have you come to torment us before our time? We know we shall be tormented. But please wait till then. I didn't come to torment you. come to cast you out. So what the power we have is to do what? Cast. He said these things shall follow those that believe. In my name they shall do what? Amen. Hallelujah. So the Lord pierced through their realm. Amen. Amen. He pierced through the realm of demons. Then they went to the abboard of Satan. Yes. And I like this one the way the prophet dramatized it. Yes. He said when Jesus got to where Satan was, Satan was doing a thanksgiving. Amen. He said at last you are here. I thought I got you when I killed Isaiah. Amen. You will see the lesson I learned. God taught me from that. I thought I got you when I killed Jeremiah. When I killed this one, when I did this one, I thought I got you. But you are now here. Then I sat there one day was showing me something. He said, "Why did Satan mistook the identity of these personalities for Jesus?" It means even under the Old Testament dispensation, they live so well like Christ until the devil took them for grass. Hallelujah. So for me it's a great compliment. [Applause] If they could live so well like that, how much more hot we After we receive the power, hallelujah, the very life of him, not as an inspiration, but as a baptism, as a possession, hallelujah, our life will be greater. [Applause] Jesus said, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, keep quiet. Maybe if you have the time, you will give your testimony. But you see I am pressed for time because 72 hours must not happen here. Everything I need to do must happen within 72 hours. Yes. And you are part of the deals. You're part of the project I need to fix after you. I have more things and I must do it in that range. So I don't have time for your testimony. [Music] The only reason I come here is to get the key. Hand me over. The keys of hell, the keys of death, the keys of grave. Hand it to me. See my blood up here. It's been accepted. You have no right to hold it any longer. Satan cannot keep agreement. So if you are going to get it, you got to get it by force. You've got to stand. You've got to be determined. You've got to be persistent. Hallelujah. And the prophet said Jesus gave him a deadly kick. Before he could recover, the king was gone. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And Jesus left his realm. Hallelujah. He came to where those unrepentant people were. He said, "Look, the Bible said since the days of the long suffering of Noah, do you remember that souls that are in prison now, he came to them and said, I was the one that was preached to you that you rejected. I was the ark that Noah preached. Oh, we are ready to believe you. It's too late and it's going to be too late one of these days. If you are too sophisticated to accept it now, it's going to be too late for you one of these days. I give you that guarantee. If your class is too high to join the Holy Ghost band who says amen, who dress right, who live right, who don't cheat, who don't steal, who don't commit adultery, who don't live by fornication, who don't steal money, if that class is too simple for you, one of these days, you are going to come to your losses. You know what? Yes. The spirit of the Lord will be withdrawn shortly. And you and I are still here. [Music] And when that spirit of the Lord is withdrawn, he that is holy will be holy still. He that is filled will be filled this time. That's right. And the church will remain here for a while. Preaching to who? The eternal Lord. If we say nothing, our presence becomes the sermon to the eternal Lord. Because in that hour, nobody will be able to cross from one side to the other. It is over. Let me tell you the silent ark was the final message. Yes. Noah preached for 120 years. Yes. And the sermon brought in animals and ate souls. And the Lord shut the door for rain didn't fall immediately. A close silent hour became the final testimony to the eternal Lord is going to happen one of these days as it was in the days of Noah. As it was in the days of God, so shall it be. [Applause] While you can fix it, fix it now. Even if you have been aosted to the truth and God hasn't accounted as having blasphe, you can still fix it now. This is the time you and I have. Amen. We don't know what can happen tomorrow. He had to show to give a witness, brethren, that Noah was right and they were wrong. Isaiah was right. They were wrong. Jeremiah was right. They were wrong. Daniel was right. They were wrong. Hallelujah. After he finished with them, he changed dimensions. Amen. And they came to the paradise that then was because as I told you last night, even though those people died in the hope of the Lord, yet they were locked under the key Yes. of the devil, Satan, the author of death, them bound. Yes. Christ having broken the power of death by condemning and dealing with sin. Is God the authority to unlock death prisoners? Hallelujah. Then I can see him come to where Abraham was loved. [Music] [Applause] Who is that? I am the one who said I will visit you according to the time of life. I am here. Come see. Heaven is called you will return. I call you a pig. We are strangers. He is here. God told Abraham, "Come out quickly. Quickly. I have a job 72 hours." We shall have enough time to tell it. Just came out. Who is that? The wind in the middle of the wind. Lost. So did Jeremiah. So did Ezekiel. So did all of them. They all came out. And on the 10th day, hallelujah. They all resurrected with Christ. Hallelujah. This hope maketh not ashamed. Christ promises. He fulfilled his promise. The Bible said he rose with thousand times thousands. Yes, sir. Both the ones whose name you know and the ones whose names you don't know, they all resurrected. And they were appearing in Jerusalem looking, oh, this thing has changed over time. Can you can you do you remember that place we used to wonderful and they were just going like that? And they were around for like 40 days while Jesus was finishing up in his postresurrection ministry with the saints with the living saints. The resurrected saints were having a good time and the prophet said anytime somebody spot any of them they change places. Hallelujah. That is going to happen one more time. Amen. This is the good news I offer you. This is the good news I offer you. This shout message. This thought pool, this revealed word, the opening of the word is going to work upon the atoms of your body. Hallelujah. Until your life will come to a climax. And it will provoke resurrection. Did you hear me? Hallelujah. Amen. They are waiting on you and I. Yes. [Music] [Applause] We are the one holding them down. When we come to that clearance and we are ready for the fullness of our adoption, which is your body change. Oh yes. Now the fullness of adoption. Our lives provoke resurrection. They will hear him loud and clear and come out of their graves. Amen. Their resurrection will produce our body change. Hallelujah. That is what the scripture said. He said we shall not prevent. The prophet said we shall not have a first advantage. Our life will provoke them coming up for it is their coming up that will break our own body change. And we shall be seen one and another. How long that is going to be? I don't know. But do you know what the prophet said? He said God will not wait for us to get to heaven before we know those who make it. He said we shall get right there. So one of these you see pastor just said thank God I made it. Francis and all those who have come up Joseph the rest of I don't know all their names but all the saints you have done just come up and say thank you Jesus because you won't see them if you are not connected with him that is why I said restoration and rapture has a location and the location is the message of the hour that is our own Outside of this message, no rapture. It is a hope that make no after about 40 days. I don't know how long is going to last between the resurrected and the living saints. I don't know how long it's going to last. Amen. So don't quote me and say brother did say 40 days. I don't know if it's going to be 40 or less. But I'm giving you a time in the scripture that was 40 days. Amen. And the prophet said we won't wait to get to heaven to know who made it. Said we go to see them right here. Get acquainted, shake hands, have good fellowship. That is our gathering together. That is a trumpet happening. And the climax of the trumpet is to do what? Take us for that sorrow. And so shall we ever be. with the Lord. Hallelujah. No more partying from that moment. Wedding supper together. Millennium together. We become wife. That is why we can be the wedding reception. We become wife. That is why we can spend millennial time with him. Who are the people who go to honeymoon together? Huh? You carry three or four people to my sister said, "No way. Only two. Hallelujah. For the church on earth will be the redeemed. Satan will be bound a thousand years and we will have no after that. King Jesus and his queen. She became queen because she's married. Hallelujah. They going to sit and judge the earth. The brother said the judgment is your own testimony. Amen. When somebody comes up and give excuse why he couldn't leave a body life in that door and that is so simp God will just look around and say queen come on heaven say something I live right in and to the glory of God I did this that's the judgment praise it's your against there. Hallelujah. And after that comes the punching of the earth, lake of fire that renovates the earth and prepare it for eternal living. Amen. The fire, the prophet said, is not just going to be all natural fire. Yes. Supernatural atomic. Yes. Will create a volcanic eruption. Yes. Around the center spread of the earth. Amen. And the period mountain will be pushed out. Yes. Right around Palestinian Canaan territory. But the city that John saw coming down to rest upon a physical city. Physical city. Friends. Only the bride who became wise. Yes. Only those message believers will live inside that city. the outest of every age. Those who will attach eternal life at the white throne judgment are going to populate around the city. Form nations and we put kings over them. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And once in a cycle their kings will come. Yes. To pay tribute to King Jesus and his queen. Amen. And when they are leaving, we shall tell them proclaim me from the tree of life as a sovereign to show to the people that once upon a time we have wars, chaos and commotions, sanctions and so forth. But in this economy, none of it's eternal peace, joy, and blessings of the almighty God. What a wonderful time that will be friends. That is the Easter that Christ has given you and her. When Christ finished his post resurrection ministry, he was ready to leave. Amen. It was Jesus many s but thousands of saints like were flying with him to glory. And King David pictured them when they got to the porters of glory. Amen. They were the ones singing lift up ye gates and open for the king of glory. for God is and the potters of heaven said, "Who is this king of glory? Those who have tasted his power, those who have experienced his redemption, they were the one that answered back, not even Jesus." They said, "The Lord mighty in battle. He is the king of glory." One of these there will be another amage mar up to glory one more time. and we shall sing the song of victory. God bless you. [Applause] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen.
