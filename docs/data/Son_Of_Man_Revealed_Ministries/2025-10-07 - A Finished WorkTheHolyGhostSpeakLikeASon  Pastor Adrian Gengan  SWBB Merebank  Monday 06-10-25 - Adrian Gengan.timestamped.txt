[0:02] Every day,
[0:04] &gt;&gt; every day
[0:07] and everyone,
[0:12] [Music]
[0:17] &gt;&gt; let's do powerful prayer. Our gracious
[0:19] loving heavenly father, what a privilege
[0:21] it is for us to come and be gathered
[0:23] together, Lord, in this evening time.
[0:25] And Lord, even as we've come for the
[0:27] special time, Lord, of consecration,
[0:29] Lord, you see the hearts of your people,
[0:31] oh God, the desperate cry within them,
[0:33] oh God, Lord, for an outpouring of your
[0:36] spirit, Lord Jesus, for the dynamics to
[0:39] fall upon the mechanics, oh God. And
[0:42] Lord, we believe you've positioned us
[0:43] for such a time as this. Oh God, we know
[0:46] you've called us for the season, for
[0:47] this time, for this purpose. Oh God, and
[0:50] even as we see, Lord, world leaders,
[0:52] Lord, politics, religion, everything
[0:54] take their place, we're glad to see your
[0:56] bride take their place, oh God. Lord
[0:58] position ourselves. So we ask Lord that
[1:01] the angel of God be present with us.
[1:03] Great Holy Spirit come amongst us. Oh
[1:05] God we are depending on you. We pray
[1:07] Lord that your word will quicken us
[1:08] Father and raise the faith of your
[1:10] people oh God for them to receive what
[1:13] they desire now. Lord I pray Lord that
[1:16] your spirit will be amongst us now even
[1:17] as we further continue. We ask your
[1:20] blessings in the mighty name of our Lord
[1:21] and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:24] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a big hand of
[1:26] praise. Amen.
[1:31] We greet everyone in the mighty name of
[1:33] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe everyone's under
[1:37] expectation for the Lord to do
[1:39] something.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know we taught by the
[1:43] prophet, we get what we expect.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I say increase your
[1:46] expectation. Enlarge your borders and
[1:48] enlarge your territories this week.
[1:50] Amen. We're thankful. Amen. For the man
[1:52] of God who has a vision for the church,
[1:54] our pastor.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And without a vision, the people
[1:57] perish.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we thank the Lord. Amen. That
[2:00] the Lord has put this upon the heart of
[2:02] our pastor Denzel.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I pray that even as we go
[2:05] through the word, Amen. things will be
[2:07] quicker to you. That you can have some
[2:09] faith this evening. Amen.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; And if you know that not all of you will
[2:13] receive everything in one night.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; But you know that some of you will
[2:16] receive it tonight.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; It's according to your expectations. So
[2:22] let's turn to Genesis chapter 1. Let's
[2:24] get to the our origins.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30] This is where we fell from and this is
[2:32] what Jesus Christ has already done for
[2:34] us.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I say it in that way because
[2:37] Christ is not coming to do any new
[2:39] thing.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; He's already done it for us.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; Satan lies to us that there's something
[2:44] that further work to be done,
[2:46] &gt;&gt; but it's a finished work of Jesus.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; Genesis 1 chapter 1 verse 26. And God
[2:53] said, "Let us make man in our image, and
[2:56] after our likeness,
[2:58] and let him have dominion over the fish
[3:00] of the sea, and over the fowl of the
[3:02] air, and over the cattle, and over and
[3:04] all the earth, and over every creeping
[3:06] thing that creepeth upon the earth."
[3:10] &gt;&gt; So God created man in his own image.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; In the image of God created he him, male
[3:17] and female created he them. Now notice
[3:20] there in 26 he says let's make man in
[3:23] our image and likeness.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; But when he creates man there's one part
[3:27] missing.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; If you see there he says God created man
[3:32] in his image. He doesn't speak about the
[3:34] likeness.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. And God blessed
[3:38] them and said unto them, "Be fruitful,
[3:41] multiply, replenish the earth, and
[3:42] subdue it, and have dominion over the
[3:44] fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
[3:46] the air, and over every living thing
[3:48] that moveth upon the earth." So the
[3:51] denominational concept is that man was
[3:53] made to worship.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; God already had worship.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; God had created the angels to worship.
[3:59] &gt;&gt; But here, if you read the Bible, he
[4:00] says, "Let them have dominion."
[4:02] &gt;&gt; Man is supposed to have dominion upon
[4:04] the earth.
[4:06] Amen. This is one more portion of
[4:08] scripture. Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10.
[4:19] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10 says,
[4:21] "For we are his workmanship."
[4:24] &gt;&gt; We just read we were created by him.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; Where is his workmanship? Now God don't
[4:29] create defective workmanship.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:34] God's thoughts are excellent.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; So we are his workmanship.
[4:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:39] &gt;&gt; So his thoughts of us is excellence.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; He says, "I know the plans I have for
[4:43] you, say the Lord. For we are his
[4:45] workmanship created in Christ Jesus."
[4:48] &gt;&gt; So you see our identity is in Christ
[4:50] Jesus.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not operating independent
[4:54] from Jesus.
[4:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when the headstone has come
[4:57] upon the body, we are in Christ seated
[4:59] in heavenly places, present tense.
[5:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes, sir.
[5:03] &gt;&gt; Created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[5:07] which God had made before before day
[5:09] that we should walk in them. The Lord
[5:11] had bless you through the reading of his
[5:12] word. You may be seated.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:20] So if we're looking at the scripture
[5:21] now, remember our goal and our purpose
[5:24] is to go back to our original.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; That's what the cross was for. That's
[5:28] why Jesus came and died to take us back
[5:31] to what he created us in the beginning.
[5:33] &gt;&gt; Because of the fall, we lost our
[5:35] consciousness and we had amnesia. We
[5:37] forgotten what God had made us to be.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; But the scriptures are here to remind us
[5:42] what God has created us in Christ Jesus.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; And we know this great mystery laying
[5:47] here. Amen. That when God had created
[5:49] the spirit man, locked up in the spirit
[5:51] man were Amen. They were male and
[5:53] female.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But then God takes his
[5:56] spirit and he puts him in a body of
[5:57] flesh.
[5:59] &gt;&gt; Now notice we were speaking about being
[6:01] created in his image and likeness. And
[6:03] the Bible doesn't say anything about
[6:04] being in his likeness. He says
[6:07] &gt;&gt; God created him in his image because
[6:08] there was a path for Adam to play and
[6:11] grow up into the mature state of the
[6:13] word.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; Now follow my thought. Mazdc was the
[6:16] mature state of the word.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God had just condescended from
[6:20] spirit to word to flesh.
[6:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you didn't know, the spirit
[6:25] that was living within Adam was the Holy
[6:28] Ghost.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:31] &gt;&gt; That was the original title deed that we
[6:33] lost.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister, if you can just back up
[6:36] the original spirit. Amen. Because I
[6:38] sent some unbelief here. People believe
[6:40] that we have the Holy Ghost, but they
[6:42] don't believe that Adam had the Holy
[6:43] Ghost.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; That is the secret.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; Adam lost the Holy Ghost.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; And because of the Holy Ghost, Adam
[6:51] could operate like a God man. Amen.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; Adam could speak to the wind. He could
[6:55] speak to the waves. He could speak to
[6:56] things. Amen.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God had pondered.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; God was now dwelling in a man.
[7:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; When you find it, sister, you just tell
[7:06] me. I think you'll find two hits there.
[7:08] But if you find the exact search
[7:09] original spirit and we'll just find it
[7:11] where where the property's talking about
[7:13] this. You'll also find it in Christ the
[7:15] mystery of God revealed. Amen. Let's
[7:18] just go to the top of this. Let's take
[7:20] it from the time somebody's born again.
[7:22] When a man confesses his sins,
[7:24] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; and gets right with God and God drops
[7:27] the sin of his this confession into the
[7:29] blood of his own blood and forgives that
[7:32] sin and replaces in that man the
[7:35] original spirit
[7:36] &gt;&gt; that should have been there.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; So man's original spirit is the Holy
[7:42] Spirit.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; Now if if you're wondering now where
[7:45] where are we going with this? Think of
[7:47] it. Jesus died. He rose again. Amen.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; And they come and they they're about to
[7:51] see Jesus ascend to heaven and they're
[7:53] asking him, "When are you going to
[7:55] restore the kingdom?"
[7:56] &gt;&gt; They're expecting Jesus to restore a
[7:58] king like David and a king like Solomon.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; And Jesus tells them, "It's not for you
[8:03] to know the times and the seasons, but
[8:06] you shall receive power."
[8:09] &gt;&gt; They thought Jesus was coming to
[8:11] establish a physical kingdom with a
[8:12] physical king. Amen. But yeah, Jesus was
[8:15] going to bring back man's original
[8:16] spirit and establish you as king and
[8:19] preached on the earth.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; Now, what would be the first thing if we
[8:27] if if somebody lost something in the
[8:29] garden of Eden,
[8:30] &gt;&gt; the first thing I must give you back?
[8:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; When you are redeemed,
[8:34] &gt;&gt; yes,
[8:36] &gt;&gt; is the first thing you lost.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; So Jesus tells him, go in the upper
[8:42] room. Amen.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; Wait 10 days there.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; And the first thing that comes back to
[8:49] man is the first thing that they lost.
[8:51] And Amen. Like a mighty rushing wind
[8:54] come to the Holy Ghost better to dwell
[8:56] in the original dwelling place.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; Now that's where the power comes from.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You shall be endured with power.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost comes upon you.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So the devil wants us to amen
[9:12] to to confuse our thinking and make us
[9:15] think that there's something more to
[9:16] attain like he did with
[9:18] &gt;&gt; Eve.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; They were already in the image of God.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; To be in the image of God, it means to
[9:24] be Amen. to have his character.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. To have God's nature.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:31] &gt;&gt; And to the word image means to have his
[9:34] character. His nature to function. Amen.
[9:36] To be like God. Amen.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; And the word likeness means to function
[9:39] like God.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; To function like God.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; To be in doubt and worry is to
[9:47] malfunction.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; To be an unbelief is to malfunction.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; But we were created in the image and
[9:55] likeness of God. Now, Adam, if you find
[9:59] there, you'll find this in the in the in
[10:01] the message uh the prophet preaching in
[10:03] the church ages that Adam was a spoken
[10:06] seed word son of God.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; If you type that up, you'll also find it
[10:10] spoken seed word.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; Now, no seed is mature.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; He says Adam was a spoken seed word son
[10:20] of God.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; Which means Adam had to grow up in
[10:23] stature.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; And that's where Eve couldn't wait for
[10:28] Adam to come to the mature state of the
[10:30] word.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; If you're wondering where we're going
[10:34] with this, that's exactly how we are
[10:36] coming. We are growing in his likeness.
[10:38] That's why brother Brandon draws that
[10:39] pyramid and he's got all seven virtues.
[10:42] That's the likeness of God.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; So Adam was growing from his seed spoken
[10:50] seed of God. He was going to come into a
[10:53] mature state of the word which was to be
[10:55] like Melzdc
[10:57] &gt;&gt; to function like Melzdc
[10:59] &gt;&gt; and Eve could not wait for him to come
[11:01] to the mature state of the word where he
[11:03] could speak to her and say you shall
[11:05] have a son and his name shall be called.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; So the serpent offered her two ways.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can either wait for Adam to
[11:17] come to maturity or you can reproduce
[11:19] the animal way. Yes.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; And if because she got deceived, the
[11:24] Bible says she was deceived,
[11:26] &gt;&gt; she chose to reproduce the animal way.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; That's how sin and death came into the
[11:30] world.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; So why is the Holy Ghost so important?
[11:38] The Holy Ghost is one of the most hated
[11:40] things on the earth right now.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; People don't like the Holy Ghost. People
[11:45] want healing. People want deliverance.
[11:46] People want all the blessings of God
[11:48] without the one the main central theme
[11:51] which is the Holy Ghost given to the
[11:52] believer.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost empowers us. Amen. The
[11:56] Holy Ghost is deity of God within us.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; But people hate the Holy Ghost. They
[12:02] feel the Holy Ghost is too restrictive.
[12:04] I can't watch my Netflix. I can't watch
[12:06] my shows. I can't drink. I can't smoke.
[12:09] I can't do the things of the world.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you can't tell me that you
[12:14] can take the Holy Ghost and say now Holy
[12:16] Ghost we're going to watch a series
[12:17] together.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; The Bible says or the prophet says the
[12:21] Holy Ghost takes his
[12:22] &gt;&gt; life.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost feeds on the word.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we say we are believers of the
[12:30] message. We believe an entire prophet.
[12:32] How many messages have we read?
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; We believe this prophet
[12:38] &gt;&gt; but we don't read his books. Amen.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; We so much on Tik Tok,
[12:42] &gt;&gt; on Facebook.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. On Instagram, and all of these
[12:47] things, but we believe a message.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; We must be careful we don't become like
[12:51] Pharisees.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; We have Abraham as our father.
[12:57] &gt;&gt; We have Brandham as our prophet.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; Do you know you identifying brother
[13:02] Brandham as a prophet is not good
[13:03] enough?
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; A lot of people identify William
[13:06] Brandham as a prophet.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. The key is his message. If
[13:11] your heart is not turned back,
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; The key to William Brand is that your
[13:18] heart must be turned back to the
[13:21] original thing.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; Which means the same signs, the same
[13:25] wonders, the same miracles ought to be
[13:27] present in a people.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to know that it is a
[13:31] finished work. Amen.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Do you know brother Brandon says we
[13:36] don't have time to go into the quotes
[13:38] but if you want to read it amen you can
[13:40] find it and show it to you.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says if Jesus was
[13:43] standing here right now
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; And you came and touched the off his
[13:50] garment nothing will happen.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you came to Jesus and said,
[13:56] "Son of David, have mercy on me."
[13:58] Nothing would happen
[14:00] &gt;&gt; because he has already paid the price.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Brother is saying now that Jesus will
[14:08] tell you, "I can't do anything for you.
[14:11] You've got to believe the word that by
[14:13] my stripes you were healed."
[14:17] &gt;&gt; If you put up one Peter chapter 2 verse
[14:19] 24 there,
[14:21] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; He says, Amen.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Salvation and healing.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; Two things Christ has already done for
[14:28] the believer.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Peter 2:4.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; Now, this is a very very powerful
[14:36] scripture.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; He says, "Who in his own self bear our
[14:42] sins in his own body?"
[14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; So he took if he takes care of the sin
[14:46] question.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Lord,
[14:48] &gt;&gt; then you are better condition.
[14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Who in his own self bear our sins in his
[14:56] own body on the tree.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; That we being dead to sins.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. We got to believe that we
[15:02] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and we
[15:04] are dead to sin.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Do you know what the problem is? The
[15:08] problem is our tongue.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; We speak like denomination people.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We like to say brother, you
[15:14] know, I'm a sinner saved by grace. Are
[15:16] you a sinner?
[15:18] &gt;&gt; You were a sinner.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; So change your confession.
[15:22] Amen. We've got to believe we are the
[15:24] redeemed. We sing songs like, "I am
[15:26] redeemed.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; I've been bought with a price."
[15:30] &gt;&gt; But then we soon call ourselves sinners.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; You know what Christ thinks of us?
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Sinners.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; Spotless
[15:40] &gt;&gt; without wrinkle.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; That's how Christ sees us.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; And that's how we need to see ourselves.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; What did Jesus proclaim? The brother
[15:50] says Jesus proclaimed I'm the virgin
[15:52] born son of God
[15:54] &gt;&gt; and my blood is fresh on the cross. You
[15:56] remember when he's going to claim back
[15:58] &gt;&gt; the key of hell at the grave.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; You remember how brother Brandon
[16:02] dramatizes it. He identifies who he is
[16:05] and he starts to speak according to the
[16:07] confession of his faith.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; I paid the price.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says I paid the price. And
[16:14] now you've got to let go of this
[16:16] property.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; So we have got to believe. The Bible
[16:20] says that he's presenting us spotless
[16:23] &gt;&gt; without wrinkle.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blameless.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; So don't see yourself the moment we see
[16:33] ourselves as a sinner, as somebody who's
[16:36] still struggling with things. Amen. We
[16:38] are nullifying the cross.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Let me explain this to you. When how
[16:42] many people believe you're going in the
[16:43] rapture?
[16:45] Yes,
[16:45] &gt;&gt; sir. So you believe that Jesus saw you
[16:47] raptured at one point,
[16:48] &gt;&gt; which means when he died for you, he
[16:50] took care of every sin, past, present,
[16:53] and until the rapture.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; So he already saw you raptured. He
[17:01] already saw all the nonsense you're
[17:02] going to get through.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; And he already died at the cross for
[17:07] your sin. Amen.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to liberate you this evening
[17:10] to tell you there is nothing you can do
[17:13] that Christ blood hasn't taken pure.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know at the end of our message
[17:19] that Christ has only come back to redeem
[17:22] his gene back to himself.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. The part of the world that was
[17:26] part of him. He has come to pay the
[17:28] price for them to redeem them back to
[17:30] himself. Which means the missing piece
[17:32] that was taken from his side at Calvary.
[17:34] Now in this time of season after the
[17:37] fields are open the river has been put
[17:39] back
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Christ and his bride are not functioning
[17:44] as two individuals. They are functioning
[17:46] as one body one unit right now.
[17:50] That's right.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; So if we can only realize how powerful
[17:54] we are.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; The problem is with our mouth.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; God has given us dominion over the
[18:01] earth.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; God is God in the heavens,
[18:05] &gt;&gt; but here on earth, God won't violate his
[18:07] own law
[18:09] &gt;&gt; because he spoke a word in Genesis and
[18:11] said that you should have dominion on
[18:12] the earth. If God ever wants to do
[18:14] anything on the earth, he always comes
[18:16] and works by a man.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Prove me wrong. Show me in the Bible
[18:21] where God came on the earth and did
[18:22] something without first getting a man to
[18:24] cooperate with his plan.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; When Adam fell, he couldn't get anyone.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. The first man he got was Enoch.
[18:34] But Amen. And he got Enoch to build a
[18:36] pyramid which was the Bible.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; But then he finally found a man.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; By the name of Abraham.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; A man who would believe God's word.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; A man who would leave his religion,
[18:50] &gt;&gt; would leave his gods.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And follow up to this one true
[18:54] God.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; The prophet says the Holy Ghost is a
[19:01] gentleman.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; He doesn't force his way on anyone.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; But do you know who makes the Holy Ghost
[19:08] powerless?
[19:13] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God is saying this that
[19:16] the Holy Ghost needs a body to walk
[19:17] through.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; You know, the Holy Ghost is not meant to
[19:19] float around like a ghost in the air.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; He's meant to tabernacle people.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; He's meant to live in people. and we
[19:27] make it powerless. Brother Brandham says
[19:29] denominational rivers having bound
[19:32] &gt;&gt; for 2,000 years. But he says the evening
[19:35] message loose the Holy Ghost.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; I say if this is the evening message,
[19:40] the Holy Ghost is loose amongst us and
[19:42] we are the most powerful people on the
[19:44] earth right now.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; There there's there's something going on
[19:49] that message people think that Israel is
[19:51] more blessed than you. Mhm.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; Israel turned their back against Jesus
[19:57] Christ.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; But when people talk about Israel, they
[20:03] like hold them in such high regard. Do
[20:05] you know the God don't work with the Jew
[20:07] and the Gentile at the same time.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; So he's got his queen on the earth now.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; You are God's chosen people.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; You are God's chosen people.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; God won't honor the Jews prayer over
[20:28] yours.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; You are the queen of heaven.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Now, if you go to Psalm 115 there. Amen.
[20:37] Praise the Lord.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; Let's read from verse 16.
[20:51] Just want to nail this point down to
[20:53] show you that God needs you in this time
[20:56] and season.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; You know, God didn't choose any other
[20:59] people on the earth to be in the end
[21:01] time. He didn't choose Paul to be at the
[21:02] end.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; He didn't choose any Peter, the one who
[21:10] had the keys to the kingdom. He didn't
[21:12] choose them to be in the end time right
[21:13] now.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; But he chose you.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Because you have a quality of his gen
[21:19] within you. Hallelujah.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; A particular quality.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; And your gene can withstand deception.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Your gen can't be deceived.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that he says you
[21:33] will not be deceived like he fell.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Here it says the heavens even the
[21:39] heavens are whose
[21:43] &gt;&gt; but the earth yet given to who? Amen.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; So, anything that happens on the earth,
[21:51] &gt;&gt; yes,
[21:52] &gt;&gt; you are the master of creation.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Anything that's to happen on the earth
[21:59] must come via you.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; If sickness wants to enter your body,
[22:07] &gt;&gt; you have the power
[22:09] &gt;&gt; because of the finished work on Calvary.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. because of the finished work on
[22:15] Calvary, you have the power to tell it
[22:19] what to do and where to go.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we go back there now, so did
[22:24] we establish that the heavens are the
[22:25] Lord but the earth is
[22:28] &gt;&gt; this is scripture now.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. For those of you
[22:32] are quiet and you want to find your
[22:33] scripture, you maybe your scripture is
[22:35] the next one. You know, I don't know if
[22:37] you got I don't know all of you here,
[22:39] but maybe you got some quiet people in
[22:41] the church. Amen. And and you know
[22:42] people like to identify themselves in
[22:44] scripture.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; And if you put the next verse, some
[22:46] people will say that's my verse because
[22:48] it says the dead praise not the Lord.
[22:54] [Music]
[22:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; So you can see who don't praise the
[22:59] Lord.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; It's the dead.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; So what we are looking at if we go back
[23:07] to 1 Peter 2:24, we didn't finish
[23:09] reading that. Amen.
[23:12] that in his in his own body he bore our
[23:14] sins. So he took care of the sin
[23:15] question. And when sin and unbelief is
[23:18] taken care of, we are going back to our
[23:20] original condition. You should live unto
[23:23] righteousness.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Now let me see by your hands how many of
[23:29] you
[23:31] are holy.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; We all
[23:37] of you are righteous.
[23:40] You see, it's going to come.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; How many of you are perfect?
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. But you see, half the congregation
[23:51] don't have their hands up
[23:53] &gt;&gt; because we haven't realized that Christ
[23:56] has done it all.
[23:57] [Music]
[24:00] &gt;&gt; If we don't see ourselves as perfect,
[24:03] &gt;&gt; as righteous,
[24:04] &gt;&gt; as holy, then we are not yet in Christ.
[24:08] The headstone is not descended on us.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; You see up there, you'll see a suspended
[24:15] headstone.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; That was John in the days of the
[24:18] prophet.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Right now, Christ is in his people.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; We are here to welcome that Christ.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you miss them, if you miss
[24:32] the shout, you miss the rapture.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't be waiting for to meet the
[24:36] Lord in the air if you miss the shout.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; The shout is heavenly places.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; He says we are now seated together in
[24:45] heavenly places
[24:46] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; So it says here we should live unto
[24:51] righteousness.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; So we should come Hebrews tells us we
[24:55] should come boldly into his throne of
[24:57] grace.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Come boldly.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; We should never come before God with a
[25:02] servant mentality. Yeah,
[25:04] &gt;&gt; we should never come before God and say,
[25:06] "Lord, heal me. Lord, heal me. Lord,
[25:08] deliver me."
[25:09] &gt;&gt; You are nullifying the cross.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; You ought to already thank him that he
[25:16] has already healed you 2,000 years ago.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Think of John Ryan.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; John Ryan had to keep confessing.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God, I'm healed.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; He was blind as a death, but praise God,
[25:29] I'm healed.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God, I'm healed. Amen.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; It took him about 6 months to hold on to
[25:35] his confession
[25:36] &gt;&gt; and to keep confessing. Wherever he
[25:38] went, he was confessing. Praise God, I'm
[25:40] healed.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; And our Lord Jesus is the high priest of
[25:44] our confession.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; So one day, Amen. the Lord is now
[25:48] standing there as the high priest. Yes,
[25:50] sir.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; And he asked the angels.
[25:52] I my mind comes across John Ryan.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Because I have his praise here.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; And and I see his confession. He keeps
[26:01] saying, "Praise God, I'm healed."
[26:03] &gt;&gt; What's the current status of John Ryan?
[26:06] &gt;&gt; And the angel says, "Lord, he's still
[26:08] he's blind."
[26:10] &gt;&gt; But the high priest says, "Today is his
[26:11] day."
[26:13] &gt;&gt; We are going to change John Brian's
[26:16] reality to match his confession.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; So here on the earth now, John Brian is
[26:22] going to have a haircut
[26:24] &gt;&gt; and he's sitting there in the barber's
[26:26] chair.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And now they want to poke some fun
[26:29] at him and he said, "Hey John, we have
[26:31] you can see."
[26:33] &gt;&gt; Now what if that day John had enough of
[26:35] the mocking
[26:37] &gt;&gt; and enough of the laughing
[26:39] &gt;&gt; and he said, "You know what? I'm tired
[26:40] of all of this.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; For 6 months, I've held on to this
[26:43] testimony.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep my mouth quiet.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; And I want him to cut my head."
[26:49] &gt;&gt; He was one confession away from
[26:52] receiving what he had desired.
[26:56] Hallelujah.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; So one more time, praise God, I'm
[27:00] healed.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what are we saying? Hold on to
[27:09] your confession.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now some of you may be renting.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Now I was telling the church yesterday
[27:18] that it is illegal to be poor.
[27:24] Amen.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; It is illegal to be poor.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; It is illegal to be sick.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; It is illegal to be unemployed.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; You say, "How come you say it's
[27:36] illegal?" According to the word, all of
[27:38] those things are illegal.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; It's illegal for you to be sick
[27:43] &gt;&gt; because by you already healed.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; You see, we got to come with bold, run
[27:49] faith.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; If you go and find in the book of
[27:57] Genesis, after Abraham sacrifices,
[28:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[28:03] &gt;&gt; After Abraham sacrifices,
[28:05] you'll find it there. I think it's in
[28:07] forget the chapter now,
[28:09] &gt;&gt; but you'll find that the Lord tells him,
[28:11] "In blessing, I will bless thee."
[28:14] &gt;&gt; In multiplying, I will multiply thee.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know that
[28:19] scripture? In blessing, I will bless
[28:21] thee. Let's find it here in the in the
[28:23] word and you can read it for yourself
[28:24] and apply the word. Amen. How if you
[28:26] like to apply the word?
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; So, whatever God is going to do for us,
[28:31] it's already done is what I'm trying to
[28:32] say. Genesis 22:16, sister. Amen.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Genesis 22 and:e 16.
[28:39] I said,
[28:41] "Sorry, pastor. I don't know if the
[28:42] needs are only healing, but I'm
[28:44] preaching like a general thing on faith
[28:47] &gt;&gt; because it applies in all areas."
[28:50] &gt;&gt; The point is it's already done.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; You just need to awaken to the reality
[28:54] of it.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; So here he says, "And said, by myself
[28:59] have I sworn."
[29:00] &gt;&gt; God himself is swearing. Amen.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; By myself have I sworn, sayeth the Lord,
[29:06] for because thou has done this thing and
[29:08] has not put out thy son, thine only son,
[29:12] &gt;&gt; that in blessing I will bless thee.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; And in multiplying, I will multiply thy
[29:17] seed as the stars of the heaven, and as
[29:19] the sand which is upon the seashore, and
[29:21] thy seed shall possess the gates of his
[29:23] enemies.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; And in thy seed shall all the nations of
[29:27] the earth be blessed, because thou has
[29:29] obeyed my voice. Believe me, there's a
[29:32] there's a blessing attached because you
[29:33] left denomination, you left your Hindu
[29:35] religion, you left your religion, you
[29:38] left the people of this world and you
[29:39] obey the voice of God.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; There's a blessing attached to them.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Now you say, what has got to do with me?
[29:47] You see, most of you now are thinking,
[29:48] I'm not saying all of you, most of you
[29:50] are thinking now on the Jewish people
[29:52] &gt;&gt; being the seed.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Galatians 3 and verse 29 and
[29:56] see who the seed is.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Galatians 3:29. If you be where?
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Galatians 3 29.
[30:12] And if you be Christ,
[30:13] &gt;&gt; yes.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; Didn't we just read in Ephesians 2:10?
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; That we were his workmanship created in
[30:20] Christ.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; If we be in Christ,
[30:23] &gt;&gt; then you are Abraham's seed. Yes.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; And according to the promise
[30:28] &gt;&gt; that's why I say it is illegal to be
[30:30] poor because of this word.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Which means we are not operating under
[30:37] by myself have I sworn
[30:39] &gt;&gt; in blessing our blessing.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; So what do we need to do? Change our
[30:43] confession.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; We live as high as our confession.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. the situations, the current places
[30:52] we find ourselves in is because of our
[30:54] lack of vision.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; It's a lack of vision.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; If if you're desiring a certain thing,
[31:04] God has placed a desire in.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; I say if you're born again and you're a
[31:08] faithful son of God.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Don't put it to sleep.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Be a man of vision.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Indoors. Indoors. I think it's paragraph
[31:18] 84. Brother Brandon says, "I like a man
[31:20] of vision."
[31:21] &gt;&gt; Not somebody just laying around saying,
[31:22] "Oh, whatever will be will be."
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; He says, "Go do something about it."
[31:29] &gt;&gt; God placed you on the earth.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; I said it's illegal to be unemployed
[31:33] because God created man and he said,
[31:35] "Amen. Go work in the garden." He
[31:37] created a garden and he put man to work
[31:40] in the garden. Amen.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; So my plan is to show you if you're
[31:42] unemployed, you need to go to God as a
[31:44] son of God and say it is illegal for me
[31:47] to be unemployed.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; I come here as a son of God.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; I come here not with servant mentality,
[31:53] but I come here knowing my position in
[31:55] Christ.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; And I thank you for employment.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Cuz some of you maybe you know sometimes
[32:01] you can get a job but as life situation
[32:04] changes that finance is not good enough
[32:06] for you.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you have your first child and
[32:09] then change things change. You have your
[32:11] second child, things change.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're trusting the Lord. If you
[32:20] go to Psalm 75:6, there you're trusting
[32:23] the Lord for something. I want you to
[32:26] know it is not with you pleading to your
[32:28] boss.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; You need to go to God. Amen.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Joseph was the least qualified to run
[32:42] Egypt.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; This boy was a spoiled boy.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; He never took care of sheep.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; His brothers were taking care of sheep.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; His father gave him a seven talented
[32:52] robe.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; And he was pampered.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; He was not qu He was the least qualified
[32:59] to run part of his house,
[33:01] &gt;&gt; to be the head of the prison,
[33:03] &gt;&gt; let alone leave Egypt. Yeah.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; But God don't look the way we look.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Just like how David was not qualified to
[33:11] be a king.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; But when God qualifies a man, he equips
[33:15] a man.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; God has qualified you as the bride of
[33:18] Jesus Christ, as the wife of Jesus
[33:20] Christ, as sons and daughters of God.
[33:22] God has put his stamp of approval on
[33:24] you. And don't let the devil lie to you
[33:27] that you are not good enough. You are
[33:29] good enough. God says you are good
[33:31] enough. The Bible says that promotion
[33:33] cometh neither from the east, neither
[33:35] from the west nor from the south.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sister. But God is the judge.
[33:41] He put down one and he will sit one up.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You read 1 Chronicles
[33:52] chapter 4, be a man of vision like Jabz.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; You know, do you know Jab has such
[33:57] vision?
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because if you if you read the
[34:00] story about how they were demarcated
[34:02] land,
[34:04] &gt;&gt; the prophet says, Amen. that according
[34:06] to how their mothers called their name
[34:07] in child birth, Joshua placed them in
[34:09] the land and marked out their portion of
[34:11] their inheritance.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; But this man
[34:16] &gt;&gt; had a vision that was greater than what
[34:18] was marked up for him. Amen.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicles 4, I think it's verse 9,
[34:23] you'll see that
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Jabz worked every if he was into
[34:28] farming. I'm just dramatizing this.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Because remember in Matthew 25, God
[34:33] doesn't reward the lazy.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; He's coming back now to check on the
[34:37] talents that was given to them.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; And the one that invested, he gave more.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; The one that did nothing and buried it,
[34:43] he said, "Cast them out. You're not good
[34:45] to work in my kingdom." So always walk
[34:48] with what God gives you.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; So in 1 Chronicles chapter 4 there you
[34:54] see that Jabth is a man of vision.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; He's more honorable than his brethren
[35:00] and his mother called his name Jabz
[35:02] because I bear with sorrow. His mother
[35:04] wanted him to be a sorrowful person all
[35:06] his life.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; But this man had a man of vision.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:12] Now, according to the laws, he wasn't
[35:15] supposed to ask for more land,
[35:17] &gt;&gt; more territory. He was supposed to be
[35:19] satisfied with the portion that was
[35:21] marked out for him.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; I am saying even tonight, you can ask
[35:25] God for things impossible.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; For things impossible. Somebody was
[35:33] praying here.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother David was praying and he
[35:36] was talking about Sunday's message about
[35:38] how Elisha asked for a thing thought
[35:40] impossible. Even Elisha Elishah said you
[35:43] asking for a harmen.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; James and John mother. Now these guys
[35:51] for some reason were called the sons of
[35:53] thunder.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; The mother asked for something
[35:58] impossible.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Grant that they sit at my right,
[36:02] &gt;&gt; one on my left. Ask God for impossible
[36:05] things.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; He's more honorable. So, let's get to
[36:11] the next verse.
[36:13] James Paul and the God of Israel said,
[36:15] "Oh, that thou wouldest bless me
[36:16] indeed." Messy people think I must ask
[36:18] God for blessings. I'm showing your
[36:20] Bible.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, that thou wouldest bless me indeed.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; And enlarge my coast.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Enlarge my territory.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, my vision is too big for this
[36:36] piece of land they've given me.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Pastor Denzel, your vision is too big
[36:42] for this classroom.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; The word that you're carrying is too big
[36:50] for this place.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; So God has enlarged your territory.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; God has spend it.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh that th my call and that thy
[37:02] hand would be made might be with me and
[37:05] that thou will keep me from evil.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; And that it will not grieve me. Whatever
[37:10] you going to bless me with, don't let it
[37:11] hinder my faith.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; You know that if you
[37:15] &gt;&gt; when people are rich and increase with
[37:16] good, that's when they turn away from
[37:18] God. But if you can handle it,
[37:21] &gt;&gt; God will bless you and reward you.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; And God granted him that which he
[37:28] requested. He bypassed protocols. He
[37:31] didn't go to the elders.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't go to the leaders, the tribal
[37:34] leaders and ask them. He went to the
[37:36] heavenlies.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; He contacted the higher power. And the
[37:40] Bible says God granted him that which he
[37:43] requested. I'm asking you, what is it
[37:45] that you want?
[37:46] &gt;&gt; What is it that you want?
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Don't put limitations on your vision.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Ask God for things impossible.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Ask God for big things. You know, Sam
[37:56] was one of the doctors that treated
[37:57] brother Brana. Yes.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he wanted this building.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; And he couldn't get this building
[38:02] because it was tied up in legal issues.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "I pray about it."
[38:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know if it was the next day or
[38:10] the next week or something. Saturday
[38:12] calls back the prophet.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; He says, "I don't know what happened,
[38:14] but all the legal work came right and
[38:16] now I'm a proud owner of this building."
[38:19] [Music]
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; You sitting there, you're coming now
[38:25] with a borrowed car to church. M
[38:27] &gt;&gt; everyone will speak you up. What
[38:29] happened to your own car?
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Be a man of vision.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you don't have a car, go
[38:37] hire a car.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; If you're driving a Uno and you're a man
[38:43] of vision for a Mercedes,
[38:45] &gt;&gt; it's cheaper for you to hire a car for
[38:47] one day.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Save your money. Hire the car for one
[38:50] day.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; And sit in it.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Envision yourself in it. Amen. That's
[38:57] right.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; You want to show that you didn't pass
[39:00] the
[39:04] &gt;&gt; sit in it,
[39:05] &gt;&gt; feel it.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; And say, "Lord, this is what I want."
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Start with a simple act of faith. What
[39:17] did say Abraham did? Sarah sold them
[39:20] &gt;&gt; bes.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Prepare for it already.
[39:26] Amen.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; This is a time for preparation.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Now, message people like to lie.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm here to cast out demons this
[39:35] evening.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; As long as they're taking chronic
[39:39] medication, they say they're not sick.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; They got it under control.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; You are masking your symptoms. Yeah,
[39:45] &gt;&gt; I'm here to every
[39:53] pressure tablet, every cholesterol
[39:55] tablet, anything must be.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; We can't mask what Jesus did on prayer
[40:01] &gt;&gt; until we are fine. We are managing the
[40:03] symptoms.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; No, let's leave all your medication and
[40:06] see how fine you are. and let's get back
[40:08] to the cross and what Jesus Christ did
[40:11] and let's bring back what he's
[40:33] there because she had a cyst in the
[40:34] other ovary. She was there because she
[40:36] had a cyst in the other ovary
[40:38] &gt;&gt; and there was another one with a blood
[40:40] problem and all of them had blood
[40:42] problems or blood issues or something
[40:43] you know
[40:44] &gt;&gt; severely bad with them.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; So it was the Thursday and I I was free.
[40:49] So I said okay I'm going to go to the
[40:50] hospital just to pray for her and I took
[40:52] the scripture 1 Peter 2:24. I have seen
[40:55] more miracles with this scripture
[40:57] &gt;&gt; than any other scripture I've
[41:00] &gt;&gt; read over people.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; And I just stood by a bedside. Her
[41:06] husband was there and her two daughters,
[41:08] they even have the for some reason one
[41:10] of the daughters recorded the prayer.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; So if you go here to pray, it's not some
[41:14] super duper
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; screaming and shouting. He's just
[41:18] standing quietly by the bed and praying,
[41:20] &gt;&gt; but praying as a son.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Knowing our position,
[41:25] &gt;&gt; how do we pray according to the word?
[41:27] Amen.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Anything we're going to do now, I when I
[41:32] told you about promotion, I gave you the
[41:34] scripture for promotion.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; When I told you about being poor, I gave
[41:37] you the scripture for
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Abraham. See,
[41:42] &gt;&gt; it's all by the word. You apply the
[41:44] word. You you you summon heaven and you
[41:46] tell them back the word of God.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Report back the word of God.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; It will not return void. Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; So I prayed the prayer of faith
[41:55] &gt;&gt; and after I prayed for I said Lord touch
[41:57] these other women in this world.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Right? Very simple prayer and when I was
[42:02] there it was visiting hours. So there
[42:04] was people talking and you know around
[42:06] there but as I began to pray I noticed
[42:07] the room got very quiet
[42:09] &gt;&gt; because they themselves was hearing the
[42:11] prayer and they went ash.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; So I left.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Next day I was at work and around it
[42:17] must have been around 11:00 I get the
[42:20] first message from my sister. Amen.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; She says the doctors have just come into
[42:23] the room.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; You know, they come to look at their
[42:27] patients.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; She says every one of their test results
[42:30] have come back clear
[42:32] &gt;&gt; and they all being discharged
[42:33] immediately.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; An entire world gets discharged.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Now remember when was there for surgery?
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; A test result clear.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they are sitting there now
[42:49] crying with my sister wondering how they
[42:51] are now being discharged.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; The nurses come in there and they start
[42:57] to ask him what happened here. We got no
[42:58] patients to take care of now.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; We are now in the time and season of
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; You see if you put up sorry pastor I'm
[43:10] just playing with this one scripture.
[43:12] Mark 11:23.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:15] Billy Graham didn't unlock the
[43:17] scripture.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Or Roberts didn't unlock the scripture.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; No theologian unlocked this scripture. A
[43:23] prophet in the woods was pondering upon
[43:25] this scripture.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; This is our scripture.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; If you want to know how to speak like
[43:32] Adam, this is it.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; The background of the story is this.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; The disciples have watched Jesus speak
[43:37] to a tree.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; He cursed the tree. They come back the
[43:41] next day. They see the tree with it.
[43:43] They asked Jesus a question. How are you
[43:45] able to speak to that tree and it
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus is now going to give us the key
[43:49] &gt;&gt; of how to speak like Adam?
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; This is the scripture church we need to
[43:56] apply.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Whosoever who feels like a whosoever
[44:02] here tonight
[44:04] &gt;&gt; shall say to this mountain here
[44:07] &gt;&gt; straight away. I'm just going to break
[44:09] the scripture out.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; First problem we had. Remember
[44:13] consecration is very important.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus prayed morning time, he prayed
[44:17] noon, evening time and he prayed noon
[44:19] time.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; He prayed even at midnight.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; But show me in the Bible one place when
[44:23] anyone came to him and Jesus prayed for
[44:25] them.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; So consecration is your secret time with
[44:29] the Lord. Even Jesus says don't come
[44:31] like the Pharisees public make wrong
[44:33] prayers.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; What we do?
[44:37] &gt;&gt; We would pray to the mountain.
[44:41] remember the mountain is typing your
[44:42] sickness, your circumstance, your change
[44:44] of circumstance, whatever you're going
[44:45] through,
[44:47] &gt;&gt; so whatever you're going through in that
[44:48] instant as a son of God, the Bible is
[44:50] saying to the mountain,
[44:53] &gt;&gt; not praying to the mountain,
[44:56] &gt;&gt; you should already be praying up.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; You're telling me Joshua to say, "Oh,
[45:02] just stop killing my people here. I just
[45:04] want to go pray with you."
[45:06] &gt;&gt; No.
[45:08] When God calls you in the midst of the
[45:09] heat of the son, stand still and move
[45:12] you still.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Command the situation. I'm telling you,
[45:16] you have the power, the legal authority
[45:18] on the earth.
[45:20] [Applause]
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Say to the mountain, number one, be thou
[45:23] removed
[45:26] &gt;&gt; and not only tell it what to do, but
[45:29] tell it where to go.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; You can't cast out demons and not tell
[45:33] it where to go. Because even Jesus says
[45:35] whatever you bind on earth is bound in
[45:37] heaven. Whatever you loose on earth is
[45:39] bound in a loose in heaven. Even the
[45:42] pigs wanted instruction from Jesus. Can
[45:44] we go into the pigs?
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Sorry. The demon powers there that was
[45:48] in the man of Gera.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; You want to know where you casting us
[45:51] out where we must go?
[45:53] &gt;&gt; There's some pigs here. Can we go?
[45:55] &gt;&gt; He's telling you speak to your
[45:57] situation. Tell it what to do and where
[45:59] to go.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's the key now because
[46:05] remember
[46:07] doubt came in the garden of Eden.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus is telling them don't doubt
[46:11] in your heart.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Whatever you speak what it because out
[46:14] of the abundance of the out of the mouth
[46:16] speak
[46:17] &gt;&gt; so your heart confession has gotten me
[46:19] coming out of your mouth.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; How was Joshua going to be successful?
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Keep my word in your mouth.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Don't doubt in your heart but shall
[46:28] believe those things which he had said
[46:31] shall come to pass. He shall have
[46:33] whatsoever he saith.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you say, you shall have it.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; But you got to know how to apply the
[46:43] scripture.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; You got to know how to speak to it. Tell
[46:45] it what to do, where to go.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; You got to believe your own words that
[46:49] are coming out of your own mouth.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Romans 10:9, if you put it up there, if
[46:52] you believe in your heart, confess with
[46:54] your
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; That's how the law works.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; All I'm giving you is principles. Yes.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; A principle is a law, universal law.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; If for if you're taking gravity, if I
[47:09] throw an apple up here, it must come
[47:11] down according to gravity. The law of
[47:12] gravity.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; You take the same apple and throw it up
[47:14] in the USA, it will come down.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; So God's law is applied anytime,
[47:20] &gt;&gt; anywhere, if it's applied by faith.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; In closing, I would tell you this.
[47:24] There's nothing more your pastor and I
[47:26] can teach you in the word.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Brother, the brother revealed all the
[47:29] mysteries of God.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; You know all the message.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; You know all the mysteries.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; You got 1,200 sermons. You even can
[47:37] download the table. You can have access
[47:39] to it.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; What can more can we teach you?
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; You don't need afraid to believe the
[47:43] word.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; The fact that you're sitting here on a
[47:46] Monday means you believe the word.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; You receive the word.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; You're not afraid to believe the word.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; You don't need a frame to receive the
[47:53] word.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; What's missing? Afraid to apply the
[47:56] word.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a good hand of
[47:58] praise.
[48:00] [Applause]
[48:08] Shall we stand together? Amen.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; We love him.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; We appreciate you tonight.
[48:16] [Music]
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, we thank God for his grace
[48:20] tonight.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam lost the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[48:26] And when God gave man the Holy Ghost, he
[48:29] gave him dominion over the earth.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; And what is God destroying again?
[48:35] &gt;&gt; He's destroying the Holy Ghost.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; And God is destroying the Holy Ghost in
[48:39] the church,
[48:40] &gt;&gt; then the church will have dominion
[48:42] again.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; If the church does not have dominion,
[48:46] &gt;&gt; then redemption is incomplete.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Then redemption has failed. Because if
[48:51] he's destroying man back to what Adam
[48:54] was
[48:55] man again must have the baptism of the
[48:57] Holy Ghost.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] The baptism of the Holy Ghost must have
[49:03] dominion.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So tonight you've heard the word
[49:06] being ministered.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to take your position.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; You have to enlarge your borders,
[49:12] enlarge your
[49:15] vision for yourself.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to see yourself as
[49:18] healer. You have seen yourself.
[49:22] You can't see yourself.
[49:25] But you have to change tonight. Amen.
[49:28] The word has come. The word has been
[49:30] preached. I believe we have heard the
[49:32] word tonight. Amen. Like God servant has
[49:35] said, we don't have to we don't need to
[49:37] have faith hearing this message. We have
[49:39] to have faith now applying the message.
[49:42] So now it's applying time. Amen. You
[49:44] came tonight. You have heard. But what
[49:46] will you do with what we have heard
[49:48] tonight? Amen. Will you leave it in the
[49:50] preacher's hand? Will you leave it back
[49:52] in the church? Or will you apply it
[49:54] tonight?
[49:58] [Applause]
[50:01] I'm so great expectation.
[50:04] I know tonight if there's somebody
[50:06] tonight that can raise up to that place
[50:10] and the word tonight,

[53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure each one has got your
[53:04] portion.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. receive a portion tonight the
[53:08] first night of our consecration week.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I believe and I'm under great
[53:12] expectation.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; For what God already started doing
[53:17] &gt;&gt; and what he's going to do.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; It's one thing that I took from the
[53:21] sermon this uh evening. Adam like the
[53:24] quote said, Adam had the Holy Ghost.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; That was the right spirit. That was the
[53:28] spirit that God put into him and that's
[53:30] what made him a son of God.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; And um Adam lost the Holy Ghost. Yes.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then God on the uh day of
[53:38] Pentecost, he said, "I'm going to
[53:40] restore man."
[53:41] &gt;&gt; And man couldn't be restored under the
[53:43] blood of
[53:46] &gt;&gt; the blood of Jesus Christ.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; God said resurrection of man means
[53:53] giving him back what Adam lost, which is
[53:55] a baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; The day of Pentecost, God did not give
[53:59] anything else
[54:01] &gt;&gt; to the church but the Holy Ghost.
[54:05] by the tree of fire. He says, "This is
[54:08] all that you need for your journey.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost, that's
[54:12] what Adam lost." That's what you will
[54:14] that that's what will be restored.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; And if Adam with the Holy Ghost had
[54:19] dominion, brothers and sisters, you the
[54:21] Holy Ghost
[54:25] and we have to challenge our situation.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; How you hold your token over your prayer
[54:32] &gt;&gt; and the token is the Holy Ghost.
[54:34] When you hold your token, we will go in
[54:36] prayer. He says, "God hers token and
[54:39] gives you dominion over your situation."
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Tonight we are starting off with saying,
[54:44] "Lord, I know I have many needs, but
[54:47] what I want the most tonight is what
[54:50] Adam
[54:54] [Applause]
[54:56] can have."
[54:58] [Music]
[54:59] &gt;&gt; We bow our heads and close our eyes.
[55:01] We're going to pray for a few minutes
[55:03] before we close. My father, we are so
[55:05] thankful. We are so grateful to guide
[55:08] you. And once again,
