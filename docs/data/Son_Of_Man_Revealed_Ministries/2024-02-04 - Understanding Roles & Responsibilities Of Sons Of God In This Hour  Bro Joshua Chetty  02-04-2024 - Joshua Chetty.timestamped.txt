[0:00] Oh, let the word of
[0:05] God. Amen. Praise God. Let's pray.

[0:50] That we could come back to be reconciled
[0:53] back to you, Father. Amen.
[0:55] And Lord, we know that this word that
[0:58] you have given us is taking us back to
[1:00] the original condition. Amen. That we
[1:03] ought to be in. Thank you, Lord. And
[1:05] being seated in this hour in heavenly
[1:07] places, God
[1:10] to be able to exercise the authority
[1:13] that's given to us, oh God. Amen.
[1:17] At one stage, we had amnesia.
[1:20] We didn't realize who we truly were.
[1:23] We didn't realize that we were part of
[1:25] you, Father. Lord, we thank you, oh God,
[1:29] that Lord, you loved us so much. Oh,
[1:32] yes.
[1:34] that 2,000 years ago when Lord you come
[1:37] in your son Jesus walking the earth
[1:40] he didn't shook from his
[1:42] responsibilities
[1:44] Lord because Lord there was a greater
[1:46] plan that had to be fulfilled
[1:49] to bring sons and daughters back to
[1:52] their original condition. Amen.

[2:14] hour. And Lord, we know that the
[2:17] workings of your Holy Spirit, oh God,
[2:20] Lord, are for a
[2:22] reason. So that the world would know
[2:26] that you are not a god of history,
[2:30] just a god of history, but you are a
[2:32] living God. Amen. Living amongst your
[2:35] people, Lord, and you are a supernatural
[2:39] God. And if your people who are called
[2:41] by your
[2:42] name, who claim this hour to know
[2:46] you, Lord, have to manifest the
[2:49] supernatural. Lord, thank you. We know
[2:53] God in your presence there's fullness of
[2:55] joy. Yes, Lord. In your presence, no

[3:23] disconnected to your children. You're a
[3:26] God that was once became tangible. Amen.
[3:29] So that you can feel the needs of your
[3:31] children, oh God. Yes, Lord. And you are
[3:33] connected with your children, oh God.
[3:36] Therefore, Lord, the scripture says you
[3:38] can be touched by the feelings of our
[3:40] infirmities.
[3:42] And tonight, we pray that you'll come

[4:02] Father. You are the author and the
[4:04] finisher of our faith. We've come by
[4:07] faith tonight. And we know that the
[4:11] things that you have in store for us
[4:13] will help us, oh God. And you will
[4:15] sustain us in this hour, Lord. Amen.
[4:17] Yes, Jesus. And we pray that you'll
[4:20] undertake for every need tonight. For
[4:22] every request that went fought, we know

[4:28] that you are God that's living amongst
[4:30] your people, oh God. Yes, Lord. And I
[4:32] pray tonight that you will take full
[4:34] control, have the preeminence in Jesus
[4:37] name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. I greet
[4:39] you all in the lovely name of our Lord
[4:43] and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. It's good
[4:45] to be found in the presence of God.
[4:47] Amen. Amen. Uh we know we all come from
[4:52] uh our daily lives and daily routine
[4:56] which can be tiring to the natural body.
[4:59] But we know that when we come in the
[5:01] presence of God under the anointing
[5:05] under the worship it is a refreshing.
[5:07] Amen. Amen. So we've come to be
[5:09] refreshed. Amen. Amen. So I pray tonight
[5:12] that as we hear the word of God, we will
[5:15] be refreshed in his presence. Amen.
[5:17] Amen.
[5:22] We'll open our Bibles to the book of
[5:24] Luke, reading from chapter
[5:28] 2, the book of Luke, St. Luke, chapter
[5:30] 2, and we'll go to verse
[5:38] 41. In from verse 41, it says, "Now his
[5:41] parents went to Jerusalem every year at
[5:44] the feast of the Passover. And when he
[5:46] was 12 years old, they went up to
[5:49] Jerusalem after the custom of the
[5:51] feast. And when they had fulfilled the
[5:53] days as they returned, the child Jesus
[5:56] stayed behind in
[5:58] Jerusalem. And Joseph and his mother
[6:02] knew not of it. But they supposed him to
[6:05] have been in the
[6:07] company went his journey and they sought
[6:10] him among their kins folk and
[6:13] acquaintance. Amen. You can't Amen. look
[6:17] for a son and daughter of
[6:20] God amongst the natural. Amen.
[6:25] When a son of a daughter of God comes to
[6:27] his position, when he come to
[6:29] realization of who he is, Amen. You're
[6:32] not going to find him with his old
[6:33] acquaintance any longer. Amen.
[6:37] So, and when they found him not, they
[6:40] turned back again to Jerusalem
[6:44] seeking him. And it came to pass that
[6:47] after 3 days, they found him in the
[6:50] temple. Amen. That's where sons and
[6:52] daughters of God want to be. Amen.
[6:55] Abiding in the presence of God.
[6:59] Amen. sitting in the midst of the
[7:03] doctors. Amen. Sons of daughters of
[7:06] God's going to confound of wise.
[7:10] Amen. Both hearing them and asking them
[7:14] questions. And all that heard him were
[7:16] astonished at his understanding and
[7:20] answers. Amen.
[7:23] And when they saw him, they were amazed.
[7:26] And his mother said unto him, "Son, why
[7:29] hast thou do dealt with us? Behold the
[7:32] father, and I have sought thee thoring."
[7:36] And he said unto them, "How is it that
[7:38] ye sought me? Was ye not that I must be
[7:43] about my father's business?"
[7:47] Amen. Amen. The word is correcting the
[7:49] error. Amen. Yes.
[7:52] The word a son of God now is manifesting
[7:57] or he's speaking about his mandate is in
[8:00] a way he's showing what his mandate is.
[8:02] Yes. Amen. Amen. He's showing what his
[8:05] purpose is. Amen. And that is that is to
[8:08] be about the father's business. Amen.
[8:12] And they understood not the saying which
[8:14] he spake unto them. and he went down
[8:18] with them and came to Nazareth and was
[8:21] subject unto them. So Jesus is showing a
[8:24] pattern of sunship that a son of
[8:28] God is subject to authority. There's a
[8:32] nature there's a characteristics of a
[8:34] son of God. Amen. His characteristics
[8:36] are different. Amen. He didn't come and
[8:39] say I am the son of God and this is what
[8:41] I'm going to do. He's got a nature about
[8:43] him. Amen. He's got a and he's going to
[8:45] be subject unto them. But his mother
[8:47] kept all these things in her heart. And
[8:50] Jesus increased in wisdom and stature.
[8:54] So sons of God must increase in wisdom
[8:57] and stature. Amen. Amen. And in favor
[9:00] with God and man.
[9:03] Amen. So you place on earth for a
[9:05] purpose. Amen. To be in favor of God the
[9:07] father because now you must please God.
[9:10] And you'll also be in favor with man
[9:13] because why you going to be a because
[9:15] you are on the earth is going to benefit
[9:17] man. Amen. Because sons of God on the
[9:20] earth is going to benefit man.
[9:23] Right. Verses 49 again. And he says,
[9:25] "And he said unto them, how is it that
[9:27] you sought me which not that I must be
[9:30] about my father's business?" Amen. You
[9:32] may be
[9:34] seated. Praise God. Amen. We just
[9:38] looking for a thought tonight.
[9:39] manifested sunship and we speaking about
[9:42] understanding the roles and
[9:43] responsibilities of sunship as sons of
[9:46] God in this hour. Amen. So we believe
[9:51] that calling ourselves sons of God is
[9:54] one thing but there's roles and
[9:56] responsibilities that comes with it.
[9:58] Amen.
[10:00] And a lot of people like titles. Yes. A
[10:03] lot of people like comes with the title.
[10:05] A lot of people like benefits of the
[10:07] title. Yes.
[10:09] But when it comes to roles and
[10:11] responsibilities,
[10:14] lots of people don't want to take those
[10:16] responsibilities.
[10:19] Lots of people like to shook from their
[10:20] responsibilities.
[10:23] Some people become thoughtful in their
[10:25] responsibilities. Amen. That's why we
[10:27] know we reminded there in Matthew 25 of
[10:30] talents that Jesus gave. Yes, we
[10:34] know the problem of God teaches us Adam
[10:38] he lost he was dispossessed
[10:42] of his inheritance
[10:45] and what what can cause that by becoming
[10:49] slotful you turn away from if you got
[10:52] something that God has given you you
[10:54] become slotful you can be dispossessed
[10:56] of it if I give you something if I give
[11:00] you an inheritance
[11:02] and you are slotful, you don't cultivate
[11:05] it, you don't take care of it, you can
[11:07] be dispossessed of it. For example, if I
[11:10] give
[11:11] you an expensive
[11:13] watch and if you are slotful in just
[11:16] walking around with it, flashing it in a
[11:17] dangerous place, you can be dispossessed
[11:20] of it. Yeah.
[11:23] Amen. So it is roles and
[11:26] responsibilities that comes with it.
[11:27] Amen. Amen.
[11:29] So Jesus, we know he was the pattern of
[11:32] a true son of God. Amen. Amen.
[11:36] But we know that before even he start
[11:38] his ministry, he had to be filled with
[11:40] the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. Luke
[11:44] 33:21-22 says that now when all the
[11:46] people were baptized, it came to pass
[11:48] that Jesus also being baptized and
[11:51] praying, the heaven was open, and the
[11:54] Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape
[11:56] like a dove upon him.
[11:59] So we know that the Bible doesn't
[12:01] recount of Jesus doing mighty works
[12:03] until he was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[12:07] Amen.
[12:08] So we can come we have to come to
[12:11] stages. Amen.
[12:14] We know that Jesus he was the son of
[12:16] God. But he waited for the power of the
[12:19] Holy Spirit to move into his ministry.
[12:22] Amen. Thank you. Amen. So we know
[12:25] through the word it takes us of out of
[12:27] spiritual it takes us out of spiritual
[12:29] amnesia. It shows us our true identity.
[12:32] We identify as sons and daughters of
[12:34] God. But we've got to come into full
[12:37] obedience to the word. Amen. And when
[12:39] you come to full obedience to the word,
[12:41] the prophet God says you are tit
[12:43] entitled to the token. Amen. Amen. And
[12:46] then we know that when you endured with
[12:49] power from on high Yes.
[12:52] Then we find that now you become you
[12:55] know how to you'll be able to operate in
[12:57] father's business
[13:00] cuz that's what we want to do. We want
[13:02] to operate in father's business. Amen.
[13:05] Amen. Once we come to aware of who we
[13:08] truly are
[13:10] and we come under placement because
[13:12] that's what the five-fold ministry come
[13:14] to do which is the working of the Holy
[13:16] Ghost. Amen. He comes to place sons of
[13:19] God into the body. Amen. Amen. And when
[13:22] sons of God are placed in the body, then
[13:26] it needs the Holy Ghost. You need to be
[13:28] enjoyed with power. That means the Holy
[13:31] Ghost will come with power upon you to
[13:33] now make you operate in the body. Amen.
[13:37] Amen. You don't want to just be saying
[13:39] I'm part of the body and you you're now
[13:42] a crippled member of the body or you got
[13:45] stroke, you can't move. You can't do
[13:47] anything. But you need to become an
[13:49] effective member of the body. Amen.
[13:51] Amen. And I I can't say I'm a special
[13:55] part of the body and we don't need the
[13:57] other part. We can just let him to be
[13:58] crippled. No, I need the other part to
[14:00] operate with me because every part of
[14:03] the body is needed. Amen. Every part of
[14:06] the body working together become
[14:08] effective in the kingdom of God because
[14:10] father is now put you on the earth now
[14:13] to display his kingdom.
[14:17] Amen. So we find Jesus being the son of
[14:20] God. He waited for the power of the Holy
[14:22] Spirit to move into his
[14:24] ministry. So we know that sunship
[14:28] without the Holy Spirit is incomplete
[14:30] work. Amen. So in other
[14:33] words, it's like the prodical son. He
[14:36] was a son, right? He took his
[14:39] inheritance, he went and planted it,
[14:41] went into the world. But when he come to
[14:43] the true realization, listen, I've seen
[14:45] the world now. I've seen people's
[14:49] economy and what they've got and all
[14:51] these things. I've seen life. Yes. But
[14:53] the way my father operate is king is
[14:56] business. Yes. My father's house is
[14:58] different. Amen. My father has something
[15:01] that these people don't have. These
[15:04] people were around me when I had money,
[15:06] when I had all his wealth, but as soon
[15:08] as I lost all it, they left me. But my
[15:10] father's house is built on love. He has
[15:13] a foundation of love. All around his
[15:16] house, I feel love. That I know even if
[15:18] I go there and no matter I planted
[15:21] everything, but even if I go there, I
[15:23] can even be a servant.
[15:26] But
[15:27] his father didn't want it. No. But he
[15:30] knew when he goes there and he look at
[15:32] his father coming, he wasn't going to be
[15:34] a servant. Yes. Because he's a son.
[15:37] Amen. Amen. But now when he's got a
[15:40] revelation now of his father's of his of
[15:44] his father's inheritance, when he got a
[15:46] revelation of who his father is and how
[15:49] his father conduct his affairs. Amen.
[15:52] Now he is coming back when his father
[15:54] sees him and his father knows now my son
[15:57] has been in the world. My son has
[15:59] fallen. He's seen the world. But but the
[16:01] fact that my son is coming back now, he
[16:03] has a revelation that he is my son.
[16:06] Amen. That even no matter what condition
[16:09] he was in his fallen condition, he knew
[16:11] that he could come home. Yes. Amen.
[16:13] Amen. And when his father saw the son
[16:16] coming, then father will say, "Now this
[16:19] is my son and he's coming. Now he's been
[16:22] around. He's been tried. He's been
[16:24] tested. He's been through every testing.
[16:26] And now that he's coming back, he's
[16:28] passed the tears because he's coming
[16:29] home now. And he's coming in my
[16:31] direction. He's looking from when's
[16:33] coming his help. And he know that his
[16:35] help coming from me and he's looking
[16:36] upon me. And now I know the son has a
[16:39] revelation of who I am and what I what I
[16:42] have to offer him. And now I can adopt
[16:45] him.
[16:47] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[16:52] Amen. In Luke 4:18, it says, "The spirit
[16:54] of the Lord is upon me because he had
[16:56] anointed me to preach the gospel." Amen.
[17:00] So, you can't just be going about
[17:02] father's business without being anointed
[17:04] to do it. Amen.
[17:07] Amen. We're not in the age of people
[17:09] building seminaries, building Bible
[17:11] colleges to go preach the gospel. Yes.
[17:13] Amen. Amen. You have to be anointed to
[17:16] preach the gospel of gospel. Amen. You
[17:19] had to be born into the five-fold
[17:21] ministry. Amen. Amen. You don't be
[17:23] thought into the fivefold ministry. You
[17:25] don't be schooled into it. Or somebody
[17:27] call you and say, "Lord, I feel like
[17:29] being an evangelist. I feel like being a
[17:31] pastor. I feel like being a teacher. I
[17:33] feel like being apostle. I feel like
[17:35] being a prophet." Gifts and calling
[17:37] without repentance. You are born with
[17:38] it. Amen. Those are gifts from God.
[17:41] Amen. And he's given it for the body.
[17:44] He's not given it for an individual.
[17:46] He's given it to us for his body. Amen.
[17:49] To what? to bring her to the super
[17:51] church, to bring her to the super race,
[17:54] to make her be that invincible army.
[17:56] Amen. Amen.
[17:59] Amen.
[18:03] Want to read this one
[18:05] quote. I like the way he puts it
[18:08] here. He says, "Before we go any
[18:12] further, go back Genesis 126. I'll pick
[18:16] it up. When God made man, before he made
[18:19] man, he called himself
[18:22] ll Elohim. The word means in the Hebrew
[18:26] the selfexistence.
[18:29] All by himself. Amen. Nothing existed
[18:33] before
[18:34] him. He was all the existence before
[18:38] there ever was selfexistence.
[18:42] One
[18:43] l Elohim means the allsufficient, all
[18:47] powerful, almighty, self-existent one.
[18:51] But in Genesis
[18:53] 2 when he made man, he said, "I am
[18:57] Yahweh, Jehovah." What did it mean? I am
[19:02] the all existence
[19:05] one who has created something of myself
[19:10] to be a son of
[19:13] mine or a temporary amateur little one
[19:17] of mine
[19:19] glory he gave man Jehovah means that he
[19:23] gave man to be an amateur god
[19:28] because he is father God and he made a
[19:33] man an amateur God. So he isn't
[19:37] self-existent anymore. Amen. He exists
[19:42] with his family.
[19:44] Amen.
[19:46] Amen.
[19:48] And no other age did they have a true
[19:50] revelation of that in its fullness like
[19:53] in this age.
[19:55] Amen. When the when there's a full
[19:57] restoration comes in of sunship. Amen.
[19:59] In this age when title deed comes back,
[20:02] what was dispossessed from Adam, title
[20:04] deed that was dispossessed from Adam has
[20:07] now come back. Amen.
[20:10] And he comes back. What it is Jehovah
[20:13] God now existing with his family.
[20:20] And so he had this
[20:22] desire of having a go man to be an
[20:25] amateur god.
[20:28] But that's how the that's how the first
[20:31] Adam operated. We know that,
[20:34] right? Because he says
[20:36] here, so he isn't self-existence
[20:39] anymore. He exists with his family. He
[20:41] said he is Jehovah. Jehovah meaning the
[20:43] one who exists with his family. Now God
[20:45] made man to be the predominant over all
[20:48] the earth. Amen. He didn't make him any
[20:51] lesser than that. Yes.
[20:55] He had dominion. Yes. And the earth was
[20:59] man's dominion. Amen. That's scripture.
[21:02] Then he if that is domain, he was God
[21:07] over the earth. He could speak and it
[21:09] would be so. He could speak this and it
[21:12] would be so. There he is. God Jehovah.
[21:16] The one who the one who once existed in
[21:20] self-existence but now exists with his
[21:22] family and his little ones with him.
[21:24] There you are. Now we know we've seen
[21:27] after the fall of man. We seen that in
[21:29] the types through the Bible through the
[21:31] prophets through the kings and so forth.
[21:34] But only when Jesus comes on the earth
[21:38] you feel the you see the fullness of
[21:40] sunship being manifested. Amen. Then you
[21:43] see a God man. Amen. There you see man
[21:46] operating like God because you you never
[21:49] saw it in his fullness before. But here
[21:52] here comes Jesus on the earth. Now he's
[21:54] showing our man is God. Amen. I'm
[21:57] talking about on the earth. Our man can
[21:59] have dominion. Amen. Amen.
[22:02] And Jesus he he became various things to
[22:05] various people in different
[22:06] situations. Amen. He met people at their
[22:10] point of need in different ways. Amen.
[22:12] To show it that he was different. Amen.
[22:16] He could be all things to all
[22:18] men. So that get to what I was trying to
[22:24] say. For
[22:26] example, he Jesus never used a single
[22:29] single single method in his ministry.
[22:35] For example, for healing.
[22:37] He never just went to everybody and just
[22:39] touched them and they were healed.
[22:43] But he used it and it was he used
[22:46] methods that was needed in that time.
[22:49] Amen. Amen. He ministered in every
[22:52] situation that demonstrate that God
[22:55] operates in many facets. Amen. Amen.
[22:58] Amen. I don't believe God just operate
[23:01] one once one in one way. He has many
[23:04] ways of operating. Yes. For
[23:07] example, in Matthew 8:23, it speaks
[23:11] about when
[23:12] Jesus, he made direct contact with the
[23:15] leper, Jesus touched him and we know he
[23:18] was cleansed. Amen. The woman with the
[23:21] issue of blood, she touched him off his
[23:23] garment. Mark 5:27 speaks about that.
[23:26] And she received the healing by touching
[23:27] him. Touching him of his garment,
[23:30] showing that faith made the connection.
[23:32] Amen. Amen.
[23:34] And then we find in John 19 6 and 7 it
[23:38] speaks about Jesus using natural
[23:40] elements. Amen. When there were a blind
[23:43] man, Jesus puts on the ground. Amen. And
[23:47] he makes clay.
[23:49] Now he's showing that you come from the
[23:51] dust of the earth. Amen.
[23:53] Amen. I can take that same dust and
[23:55] create eyes on you. But here he's
[23:57] showing as well. He's also demonstrating
[23:59] something else. from that same dust he's
[24:01] making clay to a blind man. He's showing
[24:05] that he can also create medication
[24:09] because eyes was is a type when God is
[24:13] talking spiritually now into the people
[24:16] that are spiritually blinded. I give you
[24:18] eyes self that you may see. Now eyes
[24:20] self was a form of an ointment that they
[24:23] that he used for people's eyes in the
[24:25] natural. But Jesus is showing contact.
[24:28] By showing this contact, he's showing
[24:29] you different how he's operating in
[24:30] different ways. Amen. So here was
[24:33] something that he
[24:34] used. We can say that Jesus is taking
[24:36] something from the natural elements of
[24:38] the earth. But a supernatural thing is
[24:40] taking place. Amen. Amen. And the
[24:43] spiritual connection to that
[24:45] is th says the buy of me I myself that
[24:48] you may see. Amen.
[24:52] So he's using natural elements and then
[24:54] he also used his word alone. Amen. Amen.
[24:57] He spoke to the storm and he said be
[24:59] still and the storm obeyed him. Amen.
[25:03] But then he met a
[25:05] man who had who was walking in
[25:08] authority.
[25:09] He met a centurion and he watched the
[25:12] character of this man. This man was a
[25:15] man that was positionally placed in
[25:17] authority. Yes. Yes. That is he said he
[25:21] spoke about he spoke to Jesus said if
[25:23] you can just speak the word and my
[25:26] servant will be healed. Amen. Because
[25:29] and Jesus saw the character of his men
[25:31] because he was a man already positioned
[25:33] in authority
[25:34] and he and he conducted his affairs and
[25:37] operated his life with that authority.
[25:40] He wasn't slaughterful in his ways.
[25:42] Amen. This wasn't a thoughtful man.
[25:44] Amen. This was a responsible man. Amen.
[25:47] Because he was he was in charge of like
[25:51] about 100 soldiers.
[25:55] And when he operated, when he's speaking
[25:58] to Jesus, he's speaking as one that he
[26:01] knows that when I speak, I'm going to
[26:03] receive what I'm speaking. Yes. Because
[26:06] he knows when he gives a command. Yes.
[26:09] It's the soldiers obey him.
[26:13] Amen. Yes. Amen. So Jesus is showing
[26:15] another character
[26:17] here. So him as Jesus spoke it because
[26:21] of his faith now. And his position at
[26:25] that time he could now receive the
[26:27] spoken word. Amen. Amen. He could
[26:29] receive the miracle for his servant just
[26:31] by Jesus speaking the words.
[26:35] Amen. So position being being sunship
[26:38] has responsibilities. Amen. The Bible
[26:41] said Jesus grew in stature. Amen. So you
[26:44] got to grow in the word.
[26:47] Amen. Only the word can grow you. Amen.
[26:50] And then you got to be fed the right
[26:52] word
[26:53] because the letter kill it but the
[26:56] spirit give it life. Now you've got to
[26:58] receive the word with quickening power.
[27:00] Amen.
[27:04] Amen. Now everybody can take the Bible
[27:07] and read it but there got to be a
[27:09] quickening of that word. It's got to be
[27:11] opened up. Amen.
[27:13] Hallelujah. And it's got to have an
[27:14] effect in your life. That's right.
[27:18] You can't
[27:19] be so you can't be walking in sunship
[27:22] remaining the same. Amen. Yes. You've
[27:25] got to got to be one that's now walking
[27:28] in proper position in authority and know
[27:31] how to conduct father's affairs.
[27:34] That's the responsibility of a son.
[27:36] Amen.
[27:37] Because when when sons come for the
[27:40] adoption ceremony, they only can come
[27:43] there after they have reached maturity,
[27:46] spiritual maturity, after they have
[27:49] proven that they can be trusted. Yes.
[27:52] With father's business. Amen. After they
[27:54] proven that they can take father's
[27:56] affair and now multiply it, can add
[27:59] value to it. Amen.
[28:04] So you find God has to have this trust
[28:06] of his sons. That's why when he speaks
[28:09] in Matthew 25 about the talents. Amen.
[28:13] He's speaking about the kingdom of
[28:14] heaven is a man traveling into a far
[28:16] country who called his own servant and
[28:18] delivered unto them his
[28:20] goods. The master must entrust his
[28:23] people with spiritual gifts. Amen.
[28:26] Amen. Revelation of the word. You can't
[28:29] be receiving revelation of the word upon
[28:32] revelation of the word and that word if
[28:36] it's revelation and you really received
[28:38] it by faith that means when you receive
[28:41] it by faith you are now understanding
[28:43] the word. Amen. So if you understand
[28:46] that word is doing something in you.
[28:47] Amen. Amen. It's stimulating you. Yes.
[28:52] Now, if you're receiving that stored up
[28:53] word, revelation, revelation,
[28:55] revelation, and if it's fermenting in
[28:57] you, can you be the same? Can you walk
[29:00] the same?
[29:02] Come on now. If I take you and I give
[29:04] you strong drink, he's drinking strong
[29:06] wine. That's from well fermented, well
[29:08] fermented wine. You can't walk the same.
[29:12] Amen. You can't be talking the same.
[29:14] Amen. Amen. There must be a change in
[29:16] your work. There must be a change in
[29:19] your nature. Amen. And there must be a
[29:21] boldness that comes upon you.
[29:24] You ever see a drunk man? How you want
[29:27] to in a fight with anybody? There's a
[29:30] boldness that comes upon you. So you
[29:33] can't be partaking of revelation,
[29:36] revelation. And if that word is
[29:38] fermenting you, you can't be the same.
[29:40] Amen. Something's got to take place.
[29:42] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[29:46] Praise God. Amen. So you find
[29:48] that a lot of people shook from the
[29:52] responsibilities but Jesus gave them the
[29:55] test when he gave them the talents.
[29:57] Amen. I mean when he gave them the
[30:00] talents the test was what would they do
[30:03] with it?
[30:05] Amen. Would it come back normal
[30:09] or is going to add value to it? Amen.
[30:11] Amen.
[30:13] God has called every one of us into this
[30:16] wonderful message. Brought us into the
[30:18] bride, brought us for a purpose. Yes,
[30:21] sir. Amen. Cuz we were called out,
[30:23] brought elected people. Amen.
[30:27] For what? What is the result? That we
[30:29] will manifest him. Amen. Amen. That we
[30:32] may become manifested sons of God. Amen.
[30:36] Amen. He made known unto us the mystery
[30:39] of his will. Yes. Amen. That there must
[30:42] be a manifestation.
[30:44] Amen. Amen. God, that's what's God's
[30:48] desire. He wanted to dwell with his
[30:50] family. He wants to fellowship with his
[30:53] family. Amen. And he wants his family.
[30:56] He wants his son to continue his work.
[30:59] That's why he could give them before he
[31:01] leaves the earth, he gives them John
[31:03] 14:12, greater works than these do.
[31:06] Amen. Yeah. Amen. Isn't it? I need to go
[31:09] because if I don't go, I can't. Then the
[31:11] Holy Ghost can come upon you.
[31:14] But I need to go so the Holy Ghost will
[31:16] come upon you. You'll be endured with
[31:18] power from. Amen. Because I need you to
[31:21] conduct my business. Because why? You
[31:24] need to call on others. Amen. Because
[31:26] why? We need all the people that are my
[31:29] family album. I need them all. Because
[31:32] why? When I'm going to renovate the
[31:33] earth and take you back to Eden again.
[31:36] When I'm thanking you, I'm back to
[31:37] eating again. I want my entire family. I
[31:39] want to have fellowship with everyone I
[31:41] love. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you. Thank
[31:45] you. Amen. We don't want to have
[31:47] temporary fellowship. We want to have
[31:49] eternal fellowship with brothers and
[31:51] sisters of like precious faith. Amen.
[31:54] Amen.
[31:56] Amen. This is not a wishy-washy gospel.
[31:58] Amen. Jesus was serious about his
[32:01] business. He said, "Don't you know I'm
[32:03] about my father's business?" Amen. Amen.
[32:06] He was serious in the way. He showed us
[32:08] the pattern. He showed us the example.
[32:10] The Apostle Paul said, "Follow me as I
[32:12] follow Christ." Amen. God set the
[32:16] examples in the Bible. God sent now he's
[32:19] turned our faith back to the fathers.
[32:20] Because why? He had to have an example
[32:22] in this day. Brother Brandham first had
[32:25] to be the example because he can't come
[32:27] with a message to turn our faith back to
[32:28] the fathers if he was not the example in
[32:31] his day. Amen. what he was a son of God
[32:34] manifested in this hour a first sheath
[32:38] wave before us in this age. Amen. That
[32:41] other son of God will come to their
[32:43] place. And then in every season, in
[32:46] every harvest, sons of God must come
[32:47] again. There must be another round of
[32:49] harvest. There must be the first sheep
[32:51] again. Amen. Wave before the people that
[32:55] if sons of God are coming to
[32:56] manifestation, we know that every child
[32:58] is different at the at different levels.
[33:01] That's why I said if your brother is
[33:02] down, don't pick on him. Pick him up.
[33:06] If he stumbles, pick him up. Because
[33:08] why? We are growing at different levels.
[33:10] But if you are there at the first wave,
[33:12] if there's one, there must be another
[33:14] one. And if there's another one, there
[33:16] must be another one. Amen. As long as we
[33:18] still on the earth, sons of God must
[33:20] come forth. Amen. Thou must prophesy
[33:23] again. Revelation 10 8 and 11. You must
[33:26] manifest the word. Amen. Amen.
[33:29] Wonderful. Call the names in a family
[33:31] album. Amen.
[33:39] So you find that God has placed us in
[33:42] different things that we do. We become
[33:44] all things to all men. The apostle Paul
[33:46] said, "I become all things to all men."
[33:48] So you meet, you've got to have as a son
[33:51] of God, if you're operating, I can't do
[33:53] something unless the father show me.
[33:55] You've got to be one in oneness with the
[33:57] father. Amen. Amen. You got to be
[33:59] oneness. The Holy Ghost and you must be
[34:01] in one. There must be in harmony. So you
[34:04] know how to operate
[34:06] in Father's kingdom. You meet a certain
[34:09] one at a point of need, you might have
[34:10] to lay hands on the sick and because a
[34:12] sign shall follow them that believe.
[34:14] When they lay hands on the sick, they
[34:16] shall recover.
[34:18] You might have a need where the Holy
[34:19] Ghost drops down and makes you speak the
[34:21] word.
[34:24] Amen. Amen. Amen. Different things for
[34:26] different needs, but you got to come
[34:28] wonders. You got to walk. You got to
[34:31] walk with him. Amen. Amen. You got to
[34:33] have fellowship with him. Amen.
[34:43] The other
[34:45] quote he says,
[34:56] Now
[35:03] because quote joy he says now here is
[35:07] among his church today made flesh in his
[35:12] church certainly
[35:15] Elohim now or if you could only realize
[35:18] that you men you were way to be a
[35:21] amateur god. You're a son of God. You're
[35:24] an heir of God and you have a domain.
[35:29] Genesis 1:2, you
[35:30] can't you can't be saying you're a son
[35:32] of God who has a kingdom and you have no
[35:34] domain. Amen.
[35:38] He gave him dominion over everything in
[35:41] the earth.
[35:44] That means every creature, every tribe,
[35:48] every tongue, every
[35:50] nation. Amen. Over everything. Over the
[35:54] the natural element, over the sun, over
[35:57] the where you can speak to the storm,
[36:01] where you can speak to weather. Amen.
[36:04] Over everything on the earth, you got
[36:06] dominion over. Amen. and every power and
[36:09] principalities and rulers of darkness
[36:10] must become subject to sons and
[36:12] daughters of God in their full
[36:14] authority. You must subdue all things.
[36:21] Amen. So he gave him dominion over
[36:24] everything in the earth. He made him god
[36:26] over the earth. That's right. He gave it
[36:28] given him gave him a domain is a king
[36:31] god. And where is got his fall? He could
[36:34] speak to the trees be changed be plucked
[36:36] up. We talking about before Adam fell,
[36:38] be plucked up and set over here to the
[36:40] winds and waves. Be still. It stopped.
[36:43] He was a God. He was God, amateur God, a
[36:45] son of God, like you're a son of your
[36:47] father. And all the world is groaning,
[36:51] waiting for the manifestation of the
[36:53] sons of God, waiting for the church to
[36:56] get back in its place again.
[37:01] Sons of God to be made manifest, waiting
[37:04] for that hour. Amen. So if this is that
[37:08] that William Brandon spoke of, then what
[37:12] responsibility is there on us? Amen. If
[37:15] this is that that was spoken of that was
[37:17] pro that was spoken of through a
[37:19] prophet,
[37:21] then what responsibilities comes upon us
[37:23] in this hour?
[37:26] Jesus knew until he goes on Calvary,
[37:29] he has to do everything that the father
[37:32] instructs him to do.
[37:34] Everything.
[37:36] And he can't turn away from it. Even
[37:39] when he even when the flesh wanted to in
[37:42] the garden of Gethsemane,
[37:44] he said, "But not my will, Lord, but
[37:46] your will be done." Amen. Amen.
[37:50] Sometimes you're going to go to trials.
[37:53] You're going to go to testings. Yes. But
[37:56] he made us overcomers.
[37:59] Amen. to overcome every demon power, to
[38:03] overcome every onslaught of the enemy,
[38:06] to to overcome every spirit of Leosia
[38:09] that's lurking around
[38:13] because we are called and positioned to
[38:15] be not influenced by the world system.
[38:19] Because we are living in another world.
[38:21] Amen. Our influence come from another
[38:24] world. Amen.
[38:26] We are now set in heavenly places. We
[38:28] are we this is the the hour where the
[38:31] pyramid comes connecting with the
[38:33] headstone. Yes. And it comes in such
[38:36] oneness that there's no you can't see
[38:38] the separation. Amen. Between the stones
[38:43] there's no separation. Amen.
[38:47] The prophet of God when he spoke about
[38:48] the natural pro you can't even put a
[38:50] razor between them. Amen.
[38:55] So you find this is that hour. This is
[38:57] death that was spoken of. Amen. Amen.
[39:02] That's right. He given him a domain. So
[39:05] he
[39:06] said, "Waiting for the hour, hope that
[39:08] don't hurt, but I just had to say the
[39:11] church is so far away from its place."
[39:14] Yes. It needs to be back to be sons of
[39:17] God again. Yes. So he wasn't asking, you
[39:20] see, it wasn't for the purpose of just
[39:22] being churchgoers,
[39:23] satisfying the conscience of coming to
[39:25] church. You got to come back to your
[39:27] original position. Amen. Because he's
[39:30] taking you back to your original
[39:31] condition. Amen. A condition that you
[39:33] fell from. Amen. The word come to
[39:36] restore. There's a full restoration of
[39:38] the word to take you back to what man
[39:40] fell from. Amen. And if the word has
[39:42] brought you back to what you fell from
[39:45] then and then you come under full
[39:48] obedience to the word and then you
[39:50] endured with power from on high, then
[39:52] there must be an operation. Amen. Amen.
[39:55] of Holy Ghost sons and daughters of God.
[39:58] Holy Ghost full sons. Amen. That's what
[40:01] the world need to see today is Holy
[40:04] Ghost full sons. Amen. Amen. Walking
[40:08] around fermented with this wine that
[40:10] they will be enjoying. Fermented.
[40:15] Not taking it to say I want to look at
[40:17] this word and now I want to make some
[40:19] kind of theology on it. Because I can
[40:20] tell you something. You can learn it.
[40:22] You can learn every part of it. You can
[40:24] buy out the quotes and so forth. It will
[40:26] do you no good until the quicking power
[40:29] comes. There must be a manifestation of
[40:31] that word. There must be a there must be
[40:34] the Holy Ghost that comes down and
[40:36] anoints that word and then it can take
[40:38] that word and when the word now will not
[40:40] return null and void because why? You're
[40:43] going to take that same word that was
[40:44] spoken there, that same spoken word, but
[40:47] when you when it's when it comes with an
[40:48] anointing, amen, that the spirit of God
[40:51] is involved in it. Amen. that it will
[40:53] bring effect to what it says.
[40:56] Amen. If it says you demon of cancer, be
[41:00] thou removed. Then that demon must give
[41:03] way to a son of God speaking with
[41:06] authority because it must recognize a
[41:09] son of God in position. You demon
[41:12] oppressing a son of God, that demon must
[41:14] listen. It must come to obedience.
[41:18] Amen. Because he said whatever
[41:20] whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall
[41:22] be bound in heaven. Whatsoever you lose.
[41:25] Who is talking about? Sons of God.
[41:28] Amen. Amen. He's not talking about the
[41:31] priest, the bishop and so forth, the the
[41:35] pope. He's talking about sons and
[41:37] daughters of God. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[41:40] Hallelujah. Lord when they washed there
[41:43] in the book of acts when he was when
[41:44] they started staging ring around full
[41:46] with the Holy Ghost the fear that Peter
[41:48] had when he was trying to hide who Jesus
[41:51] was he was trying to deny Jesus but here
[41:54] now he started to speak boldly proclaim
[41:56] the gospel amen
[41:59] that he even he could even tell us in
[42:01] men and brethren do we please God or we
[42:03] please men
[42:05] we can't we can't stop preaching in that
[42:07] name because they know redemption comes
[42:09] through the name of Jesus amen Amen.
[42:12] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[42:17] Praise God. Amen. The sons of
[42:19] God must come to to recognize their
[42:23] roles and responsibility in this hour.
[42:25] Amen. Yes.
[42:27] Now we look at some other patterns in
[42:29] the in the
[42:31] Bible
[42:35] where in the book of 2 Kings 18:3 it
[42:40] says, "And he did that which was right
[42:43] in the sight of the Lord." Speaking
[42:44] about
[42:46] Hezekiah, to all that David his father
[42:49] did. Now if you look at that and wonder
[42:52] why now David is not at the time because
[42:55] his father was he had another he had
[42:58] another father who probably walked I
[43:00] think he was a right and
[43:03] he
[43:05] was walking sinfully but now he looked
[43:09] after the pattern not his natural
[43:11] father right well David was his father
[43:14] in the in the loins but he's looking at
[43:17] his father to the one that's coming with
[43:20] a spiritual application. Yes. Right.
[43:23] He's looking at it spiritually where
[43:25] he's following a spiritual pattern. Yes.
[43:28] The one that will now cuz he realized
[43:30] David was the anointed of God. Amen. So
[43:33] he wants to take up off the dead
[43:34] pattern. Yes. As his father David
[43:37] because David was the chosen one of God.
[43:39] Amen. David was obtained of God. David
[43:42] was the anointed of God. So Hezekiah is
[43:44] looking at that and he wants to follow
[43:46] the pattern of David. Amen. Amen. And we
[43:49] know that that will come to benefit him
[43:52] later in his life. Yes.
[43:54] Because we we look at
[43:56] Hezekiah, he he was living right. But
[44:00] the time when now he comes and he and he
[44:02] gets sick. I just want to read the quote
[44:04] the way the prophet puts it
[44:06] here. He says speaking about Hezekiah.
[44:10] He
[44:18] says, "Ezekiah was told to make ready
[44:21] and to get ready because that he had to
[44:24] meet his maker." Now, what we read
[44:27] before now, he did as his father David
[44:29] did. Now, he's looking at now we're
[44:32] looking at a father-son relationship.
[44:34] We're looking at he's realizing why
[44:36] David is anointed. why you got to follow
[44:39] that one that is chosen of God. Amen.
[44:42] But he says, "Now Hezekiah was a king
[44:45] and a great man." Did you notice he's
[44:46] clear? Lord, I beseech you to consider
[44:49] me. I walked before you with a perfect
[44:52] heart.
[44:54] What a testimony to us today. And it
[44:56] should be a man that walks before God.
[44:59] Even death was pronounced upon a man and
[45:01] yet God changed his mind about him.
[45:05] Amen. Now if he did he then he can do it
[45:07] now. If you want to walk after your
[45:09] father. Amen. Amen. If you want to do
[45:13] that is right. You want to walk with an
[45:14] upright heart. You want to come to full
[45:16] obedience to the word. Amen. Amen. Even
[45:19] death can be pronounced upon you and God
[45:21] can change his mind about his word.
[45:23] Amen.
[45:24] Oh God can change the situation around.
[45:27] Amen. He can take you out of a situation
[45:29] of debt. That's right. Because here's a
[45:32] man with an upright heart. Amen.
[45:35] So even death was pronounced upon the
[45:37] man and yet God changed his mind about
[45:39] him. Lord because Hezekiah wanted to do
[45:43] something and God said he would give us
[45:46] the desires of our heart. Yes. Yes.
[45:49] Amen. And Hezekiah's time had come. See
[45:53] what the prophet is saying now. He got a
[45:54] cancer on him or something or another
[45:56] and called it a boil in that day. But we
[45:59] know boils don't regularly kill you.
[46:02] They just get well. But it was perhaps a
[46:05] cancer and it opened up like a boil and
[46:08] God told Isaiah said go up there and
[46:11] tell him that he's going to die. That
[46:15] was God's word. Now when God sent the
[46:17] prophet with a a word that word has to
[46:20] come to pass, right?
[46:23] But here's a man that followed it the
[46:25] pattern of David, his father.
[46:29] But here David was many years before
[46:31] him.
[46:35] And Hezekiah had something he wanted to
[46:37] do. Yet when you plead anything to God,
[46:40] you got to be a reason for it. It's just
[46:43] like the scripture that I so often refer
[46:46] to. If you say to this mountain, be
[46:49] moved and don't doubt, but believe that
[46:52] what you've said will come to pass, you
[46:54] can have what you said. Now that's all
[46:57] together controlled on motive and
[47:00] objective.
[47:01] see or it won't happen. So God is
[47:04] watching your motive when you're asking
[47:06] for something. Amen. Amen. You can't be
[47:09] asking God for a car and then when God
[47:12] blesses your car, you can't come to
[47:13] church with that car.
[47:16] You can't be asking God for a nice
[47:17] house, but you're not hospitalitable to
[47:19] people in your
[47:21] house. You can't be asking God for a
[47:23] better job and better money, but you're
[47:25] not helping people that I need. You
[47:27] follow what I'm saying? Amen. Amen. God
[47:30] watch the motive. Amen.
[47:33] You can't be asking God same time for
[47:34] good health, but you can't use that hell
[47:37] for God. When you're in good health now,
[47:40] are you praising God? Are you spending
[47:42] time with the things of God? Amen.
[47:46] Amen. So when you plead anything to God,
[47:49] you've got to be a reason for it. It's
[47:50] just like the scripture. Sorry. You just
[47:53] can go out here. There's where many of
[47:56] us make a many mistakes. He's going out
[47:58] and say, "Now I'll show you. you. I got
[48:00] faith to do this. Now, you're wrong to
[48:04] begin with. Amen. That's why I
[48:09] said many profess to be
[48:11] called, but watch the characteristics.
[48:14] Yes. Amen. Because what the prophet
[48:17] said, power without character is
[48:19] satanic. Amen.
[48:22] God don't give you gifts just to play
[48:24] with it. Amen. Amen.
[48:27] As I was saying a while ago, he don't
[48:30] show you visions just to play with it.
[48:32] There's nothing to play with. That's
[48:34] sacred. So gifts are secret. Yes. Amen.
[48:37] If God has given you a talent, it's
[48:39] sacred. If God has given you a gift,
[48:42] it's sacred. Amen.
[48:45] Be a prisoner to him.
[48:49] Die to self. Amen. Amen.
[48:51] No matter how much you want to tell that
[48:53] guy is wrong, watch this now. No matter
[48:57] how much you want to tell that guy is
[48:59] wrong and what this that or the other,
[49:02] you hold still to God says so. Amen.
[49:05] He's talking to talking about him when
[49:07] he got discernment. He can discern
[49:09] something. You want to correct the guy
[49:11] or you want to have discernment to
[49:12] correct a brother. Maybe he said till
[49:15] God allows him to say so. that when God
[49:17] says so then you can come when thus say
[49:20] the Lord. Amen. Until that just forget
[49:23] about it.
[49:24] The world today is just like Hezekiah
[49:26] was then it has been one. It's been one.
[49:28] It's constantly being one. The church is
[49:30] being one. And now this thing just don't
[49:32] happen by chance. They all got something
[49:35] behind them. Amen. Now Hezekiah being
[49:39] sick. You caught that? The church. Amen.
[49:45] Now Hezekiah being sick having this
[49:47] boil, it wasn't by chance.
[49:50] God God sent as Isaiah up there and told
[49:55] him to set his house in order now where
[49:57] he was going to die. Now I want to tell
[49:59] you something. Why we looking at this
[50:01] naturally? There are also spiritual
[50:03] deaths.
[50:06] God had to set warnings.
[50:08] Yes.
[50:10] And they have to have ministry with
[50:11] discernment to see where the body is
[50:15] that the body can be in a condition they
[50:17] can they approaching spiritual debt.
[50:20] Yes. But the warning is going out to
[50:22] them because it's the grace of God. They
[50:24] got the chance to repent. Amen. And come
[50:27] back to the altar. Get things right.
[50:30] Make things right. get your house in
[50:32] order
[50:34] because God wants the body to be in
[50:36] order
[50:37] because he wants it to be a foot and
[50:39] able body and watch now we're looking at
[50:41] the pattern of Hezekiah. He's not going
[50:43] to have many years left. Yes. When this
[50:45] incident when this when this healing
[50:48] takes place and he's got time to take
[50:50] get his house in order. He's got a few
[50:52] years that he's asking for. You can't
[50:54] have all eternity here. We don't have
[50:56] all the time here. Amen. We got to
[50:58] conduct father's business. Amen. Father
[51:01] is serious about his affairs and he's
[51:03] placed us in this time and season for a
[51:05] reason. Amen. And he's placed us here
[51:08] not to shuck around. Amen. But to stay
[51:10] with his word and to operate his word.
[51:14] Amen. Yes. Amen. Amen. That's right.
[51:18] So when these warnings are
[51:20] coming to God's servants that he's
[51:23] chosen in this hour, when warnings are
[51:25] coming from around the world, it's
[51:27] coming to get the body rights. Amen.
[51:30] Take them out of spiritual debt. Amen.
[51:32] Cuz they're nearing spiritual debt
[51:34] because why? The sins of leprosy have
[51:37] crept in.
[51:40] Men have become slothful. Men are
[51:42] shocking from responsibilities.
[51:45] But the Holy Ghost is graceful. Amen.
[51:48] Crying out crying out grace grace.
[51:51] Amen. Because why? God loves his son.
[51:54] Amen. Just like the son of the prodical
[51:57] son, God wants his son to get that
[51:59] revelation. And how did they get it?
[52:01] That quickening power.
[52:04] Through the to the to the anointed
[52:06] preaching of the word because it's the
[52:07] anointing that will break the yoke of
[52:09] bondage. Amen. Get the sinner back to
[52:12] the altar.
[52:18] So the world today is like Hezekiah was
[52:21] been one. He said in 47 he said now
[52:23] Hezekiah being sick having this boy it
[52:25] wasn't by chance God sent Isaiah there
[52:28] and told him to set his house in order
[52:29] now because he was going to die and
[52:31] Hezekiah wept and told God I walk before
[52:34] you with a perfect heart. I pray you
[52:37] spare my life for a cause a good cause
[52:40] the cause of God.
[52:43] Now God told the prophet said go back
[52:46] and tell him he's going to prophesy
[52:48] again now. Amen. Praise God. Amen. Now,
[52:51] isn't that strange? Hezekiah was the
[52:54] greatest man in the land.
[52:57] Hezekiah was a king and a godly man. He
[52:59] was a real man. If he could plead that
[53:02] before God and God didn't rebuke him for
[53:04] it, I walk before you with a perfect
[53:06] heart. Now, that's saying a whole Nazi.
[53:10] And God never said, "No, Hezekiah, you
[53:13] didn't do it." But he admitted he did
[53:16] it. Did do it. And he said, "I'm going
[53:18] to I'm going to spare your life a little
[53:20] longer."
[53:25] He could have come any time. He could
[53:26] have come in 2020. He could have come
[53:28] many years ago. Yes. We wasn't ready.
[53:32] The body wasn't ready. He had to come in
[53:35] readiness. He had to get things in
[53:36] order. The house had to get in order.
[53:39] Amen. Because why? Sons and sons of God
[53:43] had to come into their position. Amen.
[53:46] Yes Lord thunder sons of God have to
[53:48] come to maturity to conduct father's
[53:51] affairs
[53:53] I'm going to give you your request say
[53:56] see because he had been a just man he
[53:59] had been a real servant to Christ
[54:04] praise God
[54:06] so you see the grace of God
[54:11] Paul is saying in 1 Corinthians 11:1
[54:13] said be a followers of me even as I also
[54:16] am of Christ. Amen. He was a spiritual
[54:19] father to the early church.
[54:22] Just as Jesus followed the father's
[54:23] example. And we find now as Hezekiah
[54:26] followed David. Amen. And there's other
[54:29] people in the Bible like Josiah also
[54:30] followed David. He walked after his
[54:32] father David.
[54:34] That's what the Bible says. He walked
[54:35] after his father David. Because they saw
[54:37] the spirit. They wanted to
[54:39] align with the spiritual pattern. Amen.
[54:42] They wanted to align with an anointing.
[54:44] Amen. with an anointed man of God, with
[54:47] God's anointed king. That's what he was
[54:50] doing. He didn't want to align with his
[54:52] natural father. He wanted to align with
[54:55] David because he knew that David was the
[54:58] anointed of God. Amen.
[55:02] And we find that same thing happens with
[55:04] us. We supposed to the word has called
[55:06] us to walk in alignment with the same
[55:08] apostolic faith. Amen. With the faith of
[55:10] the fathers. We must come to that
[55:12] alignment. Amen. Amen. As the apostle,
[55:15] as the fathers walked, he said, "Behold,
[55:17] I send you Elijah the prophet before the
[55:19] great and dreadful day of the Lord, and
[55:21] he shall turn the heart of the children
[55:23] back to the faith of the fathers." Amen.
[55:26] Amen. Amen.
[55:29] So what it is true is imitating Christ.
[55:34] Amen. Not any man-made religion, not any
[55:36] man-made creeds. Hallelujah. Amen. not
[55:40] our natural leaders of the world, not
[55:43] the people of the world, but it's
[55:45] imitating Christ. Amen.
[55:49] Amen. If there's anything you should be
[55:50] imitating is imitate Christ. Amen. Amen.
[55:56] And we thank God that God sent a prophet
[55:58] to restore the apostolic pattern in his
[56:00] hour. Yes.
[56:02] Amen. Came with the same. Restore us
[56:05] back to all that was lost. Tied up all
[56:07] the
[56:08] Lucians. and then left a part for us to
[56:11] do. Amen. Amen. Fulfilled his part, left
[56:14] the scene, faithfully found in the
[56:17] father's
[56:18] business. Amen. Cuz his instruction was
[56:21] to find a bride.
[56:24] To go on go out fishing, find the
[56:27] rainbow trouts. Yes. I'm going to give
[56:29] you to I'm going to give you some baits.
[56:31] The bait is going to be healing.
[56:34] Healing the sick. First you pull
[56:36] discerning of the of the thoughts of
[56:39] people and hearts of
[56:40] people. I'm going to give you that as
[56:42] bait. But you're fishing for a rainbow
[56:45] trout. Amen. You're fishing for a
[56:47] special class of people. Amen. You
[56:50] You're fishing for those that are in my
[56:52] family helping. Those that I want to
[56:54] have fellowship with, those that I come
[56:56] to reconcile back to me.
[57:00] Amen. But you are carrying a word that
[57:02] has an anointing. It has quickening
[57:04] power. He has power to transform lives.
[57:07] No one else is carrying his power. Billy
[57:10] Graham got a ministry. He's going to get
[57:12] a lot of people. Or Robert's got a
[57:14] ministry. He's going to call a lot of
[57:15] people. But you got a ministry with
[57:17] quickening power.
[57:20] Amen. And I'm going to take you back to
[57:22] the back part of my mind. And I'm going
[57:24] to show you that I was a self-existing
[57:27] one. And I had you in my thoughts. How I
[57:30] had you in my mind. And I knew that I
[57:33] want to be a savior. I want to be a
[57:35] redeemer. I had all the attributes
[57:37] within me. But I'm going to allow my
[57:39] attributes to be manifested in my sons
[57:42] upon the earth. Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[57:46] Amen. So all the way from Adam to Brham,
[57:50] sons was being manifested. Yes.
[57:53] And it come right now to the showdown to
[57:56] the final part where God is showing his
[57:58] grace upon the earth. Before the
[58:00] spiritual depths could come upon a
[58:03] church that thought they had got the
[58:04] message. We thought we had everything.
[58:06] But God was gracious enough to say no. I
[58:09] need to carry a little longer because I
[58:11] need you to come to your rightful
[58:13] position. I need you to go and conduct
[58:15] my affairs. I need you to carry out my
[58:17] business. When I said you in the
[58:18] scripture, you shall do the greater
[58:20] works. I meant that I was for you. I
[58:23] kept that store up for you. Amen. Yes.
[58:27] Amen. Amen. This was the people that God
[58:30] kept it for.
[58:32] So you find that God has given us that
[58:35] responsibility. He's entrusted us with
[58:37] his gifts. Amen. The question
[58:41] is, have we've really come to the true
[58:45] revelation or the true understanding of
[58:48] what is really entrusted upon us?
[58:51] And have we accepted that
[58:52] responsibility?
[58:55] Because you can have the responsibility.
[58:57] But have you accepted it? Yes. Amen.
[58:59] Because only when you accept it, then
[59:01] you can manifest it. Yes. Amen. If you
[59:04] want to manifest something, you have to
[59:06] accept it first. Yes. Or you want to say
[59:08] no, it's for another brother. That's for
[59:11] an evangelist. That's for a pastor.
[59:13] That's for a teacher. That's for another
[59:15] brother who's very
[59:17] spiritual or there for another
[59:20] sister. You got to accept your own
[59:23] personal responsibility as a son and
[59:26] daughter of God. Amen.
[59:29] Cuz God is calling sons to come to full
[59:33] manifestation in this hour. Not in the
[59:36] age that you don't speak about a age
[59:38] coming because if you go if you're going
[59:40] to want to see what is happening under
[59:43] Moses and Elijah ministry you mess you
[59:45] miss the rapture. Yes. See what is
[59:48] happening in your day. See what is
[59:50] happening in your hour. God richly bless
[59:52] you. Let's stand. Amen.
[59:54] [Applause]
[59:58] Amen. And I pray that we've come to the
[1:00:01] real
[1:00:02] realization of how serious this is.
[1:00:05] We're hearing the word week after week.
[1:00:08] We're hearing it in different sequence
[1:00:09] and it's taken us. The Holy Spirit has
[1:00:12] been gracious to take us in steps. Amen.
[1:00:16] Yes. Amen. In steps of how this whole
[1:00:18] thing was unfolding.
[1:00:21] It's only the grace of God. Amen. But
[1:00:23] he's doing it for a reason. God doesn't
[1:00:26] just choose something to give you extra
[1:00:27] knowledge. or to make you know a lot of
[1:00:30] things. No, he equipss you.
[1:00:33] Equip he equipss you for his kingdom.
[1:00:36] And for his purpose. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:39] God don't want slotful children. God's
[1:00:41] sons are not slotful. God's sons are
[1:00:44] good stewards. God set the pattern in
[1:00:46] the Bible from the pro from the time
[1:00:48] he's got he's ordained servants in the
[1:00:49] Bible and the pattern no one was
[1:00:51] slotful.
[1:00:53] Amen. Everyone come to fulfill the part
[1:00:56] and they left the scene. This is the
[1:00:58] final hour, the final part. Amen. Where
[1:01:02] this final display must be happening.
[1:01:05] Amen. There must be a final showdown
[1:01:08] of sons of God upon the earth. An
[1:01:11] invincible army, a super church, a super
[1:01:14] age who knows how to handle his word.
[1:01:17] Amen. Who knows what he once done with
[1:01:19] his word. Amen. Amen. who knows to to
[1:01:23] say this word the what happened in the
[1:01:26] days of the apostle. If I can go out
[1:01:28] there as a believer then every scripture
[1:01:32] that is inspired, every scripture, every
[1:01:35] redemptive blessing, I have rightful
[1:01:36] claims over it. Yes.
[1:01:39] Now I'm going to talk like a son. No
[1:01:42] more I'm going to speak negative. Yes.
[1:01:44] Amen. Oh, I'm sick. I can't make it. Or
[1:01:47] things are bad and things are hard. I'm
[1:01:49] going to speak as a son. Amen. Yeah. Did
[1:01:51] you see Jesus stressing when they came
[1:01:54] to him and they were collecting tax? Did

[1:07:26] Amen. It's not every day there's going
[1:07:29] to be moments where you're on a platform
[1:07:32] or be
[1:07:33] called in a situation where the power is
[1:07:36] to be displayed.
[1:07:38] But it's to be translated into your
[1:07:40] life. Amen. Amen. So you become a
[1:07:42] manifested son walking into checkers.
[1:07:48] Manifested son going to school.

[1:07:56] He says he wants you to testify to the
[1:07:57] milkman. Amen. Amen. Yeah. Don't look
[1:08:01] for big things now. Because if we're
[1:08:02] going to look for the big things, we're
[1:08:04] going to miss the little things. You
[1:08:07] know, there was a man, a farmer.
[1:08:11] He had an apple farm.
[1:08:13] He didn't get saved in a big meeting.
[1:08:15] Yes.
[1:08:17] Amen. He got saved and he didn't even
[1:08:20] know he was talking to a man of God.
[1:08:21] That's right.
[1:08:23] He thought he was talking to a hunter.
[1:08:25] Yeah. So there was a manifested son as a
[1:08:28] hunter. Disguised as a hunter. Hey,

[1:08:56] are blessed. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:59] Hallelujah. Whatever we're doing, Amen.
[1:09:01] I'm just trying to help you understand.
[1:09:03] Amen. what God is trying to tell us. Our

[1:09:12] a long way.
[1:09:14] Amen. You know, we can manifest sunship
[1:09:17] and be a daughter by being good to one
[1:09:20] another.
[1:09:22] Sometimes we leave the little things
[1:09:24] undone.
[1:09:25] Having compassion,
[1:09:28] Amen. Do you know what the capstone is?
[1:09:32] That's that's the word we use. But it's
[1:09:35] actually charity. Do you know why
[1:09:37] charity is a better word than love?
[1:09:40] Because anyone can love and do nothing.
[1:09:42] But charity is love equipped with good
[1:09:44] works.
[1:09:49] I can tell everyone I love them. I love
[1:09:50] the body of Christ. I love this. Love
[1:09:52] this. And he was as tight as a Jew.
[1:09:56] Amen.
[1:09:58] But eternal life living for others is
[1:10:01] living for others. Amen. So what God is
[1:10:04] trying to tell us tonight, our roles and
[1:10:06] our responsibilities have to translate
[1:10:08] into our everyday life. Amen. Amen. Then
[1:10:11] we become an effective army. Hallelujah.
[1:10:14] Amen. And we need to get into the
[1:10:16] neighborhood and witness to everyone and
[1:10:18] tell them about the love of Jesus. Amen.
[1:10:20] And that's how we translating it now.
[1:10:22] Don't look for super duper things. We're
[1:10:24] going to translate it into our everyday
[1:10:26] life. Amen. Amen. So we thank you,
[1:10:28] brother Joshua. Amen. Let's give the
[1:10:29] Lord a great praise. Amen. For being
