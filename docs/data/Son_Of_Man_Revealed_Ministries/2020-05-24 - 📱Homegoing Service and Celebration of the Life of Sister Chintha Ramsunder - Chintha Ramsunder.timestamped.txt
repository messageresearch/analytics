[10:32] family that we know for so many years
[10:34] that we've grown attached to land we
[10:39] know for many years she's been with the
[10:41] church for 40 years I've been a loyal
[10:43] member of faithful member and not one
[10:47] that was demanding or quite much
[10:49] attention Amen but she was faithful in
[10:52] the Lord Romans would attend the
[10:55] services she would drop faith and I
[10:57] remember many times she would come and
[10:59] even pass more DVDs of preaching
[11:01] services she would request songs CDs and
[11:06] keep asking me if I could please little
[11:08] son
[11:08] maybe time he would give up I'm to be
[11:11] blessed by it and but she would keep
[11:12] requesting more which means she desire
[11:14] to be in the presence of the Lord she
[11:16] desired to be surrounded with things
[11:18] that were praising the name of our Lord
[11:19] Jesus Christ so we are honored to stand
[11:23] here today and be a witness of respect
[11:25] for time-tested memorial of her dear
[11:28] mother she has lived a life she has
[11:31] finished the race amen
[11:33] and I believe the Lord has given a final
[11:36] healing healing in the natural he's only
[11:39] a type of what is going to happen to us
[11:42] one of the days
[11:43] the final healing will be the changing
[11:44] of these bodies very many so we were
[11:47] praying when our dear mom was in
[11:48] hospital you were praying for the
[11:50] healing of her but the Lord is only
[11:51] allotted for us to live for 70 years
[11:53] upon the earth and if by grace he gives
[11:56] us another 10 years so we were praying
[11:59] to the Lord and saying Lord heal our
[12:00] gear mother touch her and in his great
[12:03] tender mercy he said I want her one more
[12:05] time but this time I'll go HeLa forever
[12:08] she steps into a new body area and
[12:11] that's where she is rejoicing right now
[12:12] and
[12:14] we could just look beyond the curtain of
[12:16] time to where she is in a new body it's
[12:18] a whole nother scene here we are said
[12:20] here we are morning but on the other
[12:22] side she's rejoicing at the same a man
[12:25] so we've got a limit to time because of
[12:29] all the respects so both of you that
[12:32] have to leave the family has requested
[12:33] the a prepared meal already pre-packed
[12:36] little boxes which tent is it yeah just
[12:41] behind this in front of this tent so
[12:43] when you're leaving you get you can take
[12:44] your meal with you and when you're
[12:48] coming here in the front we ask you to
[12:50] refrain from making contact with the
[12:52] family just to abide by the regulations
[12:53] and nobody not use this kind of funerals
[12:56] we all want to embrace one another not
[12:59] one another but if the authorities come
[13:01] here we don't also want to be shut down
[13:02] so we also want to abide by their okay
[13:05] so we will give you time to view the
[13:07] face again
[13:08] just now but we because of our limited
[13:10] time we'd like to go straight into our
[13:12] program we'd like to invite well Ronnie
[13:14] was gonna share the word of the Lord
[13:16] amen plus money has been the pastor of
[13:19] sister cinta for the last 40 years so
[13:21] I'm sure it is him join his heart in
[13:24] many said to see a member cultures gone
[13:27] but he can do joyously Amen you can do
[13:32] it knowing that she has lived a life
[13:34] faithfully before
[13:40] a big hole in the precious name of Allah
[13:47] instead of Jesus Christ in even else as
[13:50] it was said was till powers a faithful
[13:53] believer in the entire message and thank
[13:59] God for the revelation that she had he
[14:02] can be faithful and she lived with this
[14:05] house alone but almost a little bit
[14:08] alone yes she was not alone
[14:09] amen because she had the word of the
[14:11] Lord and that was I believe that kept
[14:14] her going and she really loved the
[14:17] message and she also you know in the
[14:21] last part of her life even reading the
[14:22] message the books let's speak to the
[14:27] tapes so we know she loved that world
[14:30] when there the time at the tape recorder
[14:33] got voltage stopped working she told us
[14:36] you know what my my CD player is not
[14:39] working and that she wanted us to get
[14:42] one for us so it just got a few which
[14:45] kept on reminding us I need my tape
[14:47] recorder
[14:47] so finally got one tape recorder for her
[14:51] so she can listen to the message so what
[14:55] confidence in our hearts we can stand in
[14:57] and have this field or service by many
[15:01] people services people would like to say
[15:03] something about a person and maybe
[15:06] exaggerate also but our system we don't
[15:11] have to exaggerate any it's a life that
[15:14] she left who speak for yourself
[15:17] and to the family and everybody that
[15:20] knows so we know what fate was in the
[15:22] Lord Jesus Christ and she believes with
[15:25] all our heart right to be in so give it
[15:29] glory price so then I read from the word
[15:31] of the Lord and that we pray that the
[15:33] word Allah to bless us this excuse me
[15:37] with my vocals I've got some irritation
[15:39] my throat but I praise it to know to
[15:42] make them wait for us read from the book
[15:44] of st. Bob chapter 10 verse 17 2010 I'll
[15:54] pray the Lord will bless us and I want
[15:58] to say things he had this morning that
[16:01] the Lord must be pleased what we are
[16:05] saying and also we we don't want to be
[16:10] guilty of saying something that we are
[16:12] not going to say because the Bible says
[16:15] here we'll have to give an account for
[16:17] what we say and also what we don't say
[16:22] that we should say so we're going to
[16:25] speak directly from the word it's not my
[16:27] word it's what's recorded in the Word of
[16:29] God so we must listen to what His Word
[16:33] says and be attentive to what His Word
[16:36] says so we don't want to be guilty
[16:39] before him for not saying the things
[16:41] that he want us to say so read from the
[16:44] book of said mark chapter 10
[16:47] from verse 17 to 23 and when he was God
[16:52] flawed into the way they came one
[16:55] running and kneeled to him and asked him
[16:59] good master what shall I do that I may
[17:04] inherit eternal life and Jesus 17 why
[17:09] call us now be good there is none good
[17:12] but one that is God that knows the
[17:16] connivance do not commit adultery do not
[17:20] kill do not steal do not bear false
[17:23] witness defraud not honour thy father
[17:27] and mother and he hums it and said unto
[17:30] Him master all these things I have
[17:34] observed for my youth then jesus
[17:37] beholding him loved him and said I hear
[17:40] one thing thou makest go that way sell
[17:45] whatsoever thou has and
[17:48] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[17:50] treasure in heaven and come take up the
[17:54] cross and follow me and he was sad at
[17:58] the same and whether it be for yet great
[18:04] have Richard enter into the kingdom of
[18:07] God praise the Lord let's just power it
[18:10] forward prayer even what Jesus me thank
[18:15] you lots your word and we know your hell
[18:17] your word will ever remain everything
[18:20] never pass away but your words will not
[18:22] pass away you pray that you bless us
[18:25] Lord in may our faith be anchored upon
[18:28] thy word and Lord we know the subject
[18:30] that we're speaking Lord is about life
[18:32] and eternal life we know yeah we have a
[18:36] temporal life but there is eternal life
[18:39] we pray that you bless our hearts that
[18:42] we may find it out for we ask it in
[18:44] Jesus precious name Amen amen
[18:47] if we're gonna tackle this little
[18:49] message I'd like to give it a title a
[18:51] fake world or a false world shake wool
[18:57] or a false world amen
[19:01] I believe that's a time we are living in
[19:04] everything is fake everything is false
[19:10] they don't nothing is like in its
[19:13] original condition now we know that if
[19:20] people are elderly yeah you know that
[19:22] twenty years back thirty years back
[19:25] fifty years back the world was not in
[19:28] this condition people never look the way
[19:31] they look the way they are living down
[19:34] things that are done was not done those
[19:39] years back so the world is become a fake
[19:43] no reality mm and we know the Bible
[19:48] tells us that yeah we have no cookie
[19:51] living City but we seek one is bull then
[19:54] make a is gone so we have through a
[19:56] short space of time
[19:59] certainly is even if you look one
[20:01] hundred years it's a short space of time
[20:04] and in the hundred years all of us here
[20:08] would be dead if the Lord tarries see if
[20:12] the rock don't come to take us away in
[20:13] the rapture all of us will be dead yet
[20:16] in a hundred years time uh-huh
[20:19] but if we have eternal life if we
[20:23] believed on the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[20:26] we look for ever event going on into
[20:30] eternity now we find this rich and ruler
[20:34] he was a wealthy man and if you look at
[20:39] the legend see the bottle says he came
[20:42] running you know the Lord Jesus was a
[20:45] busy man preaching every day he was on
[20:48] the street and the disciples were
[20:51] rounding men and people who are
[20:53] congregating around him and he must have
[20:55] heard them and he must have thought
[20:56] about his life now
[20:58] although he had possessions that very
[21:00] rich one thing that he thought about his
[21:03] eternal life and the Bible says he came
[21:06] running to the Lord and he went on his
[21:10] knees and he said good master what good
[21:14] thing must I do to inherit eternal life
[21:22] but he wanted he can light that Jesus
[21:26] ever people keep all the commandments he
[21:27] said I kept them out from a youth up
[21:29] growing up a kept all the world and many
[21:33] was there you know good living citizen
[21:35] then Jesus saw that the elect one thing
[21:39] that it was really really rich
[21:41] and Jesus said okay God sell all that
[21:45] you have and give to the poor and come
[21:48] and follow me that was not prepared to
[21:51] do yet he wanted to go out to every ten
[21:54] life and Jesus said well the sell of
[21:57] this thing that and give that give it
[21:59] away come and follow me take up your
[22:00] cross he didn't want did not wanna part
[22:05] with his goods he did not want to change
[22:10] his living styles and what a great
[22:14] opportunity
[22:15] he missed to follow the Lord Jesus
[22:18] Christ and he would have an eternal life
[22:23] we will see like that what what happened
[22:27] with amen so he find this world yeah
[22:32] he's only a fake whoa people are
[22:36] deceived
[22:39] Kenya or whatever is gonna be important
[22:44] to them in this life they can make all
[22:49] beans to achieve those things that is
[22:55] all well and good we gotta have a job
[22:59] we gotta handle living we gotta feed
[23:03] yourself and feed your families but
[23:05] there are people that you know chase out
[23:09] the things in this world not knowing God
[23:15] the carrier is more important the world
[23:20] is more important and you find even
[23:23] parents today they want to do everything
[23:26] for the children they want to give them
[23:29] the best education that wonderful maybe
[23:34] be a doctor or a lawyer and have a good
[23:37] job that's fine but they've got no
[23:41] eternal life they're gonna go to the
[23:44] regions of the lost all these things are
[23:48] not going to come and standing the day
[23:51] no credentials now jesus said go into
[23:57] the world and preach the gospel he that
[23:59] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[24:02] he that believeth not shall be damned so
[24:07] the gospel must be preached and people
[24:11] must yeah amen
[24:17] now there are many rich people in the
[24:19] Bible it's nothing nothing wrong with
[24:22] being rich God made people rich if we go
[24:27] to the Bible Abraham was a very rich man
[24:30] but he he served God he was obedient to
[24:34] God and then his riches never made him
[24:39] stop believing in God King David was a
[24:43] rich man being a king praise the Lord
[24:48] you can read The Book of Psalms you
[24:50] always praise God
[24:55] yet great wisdom and knowledge that he
[24:59] was able to leave Israel Moses the Bible
[25:05] tells us Moses also was to be the next
[25:10] Pharaoh in Egypt and the Bible says he
[25:13] forsook all those things he refused to
[25:18] enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season
[25:23] and then never won a great things that
[25:27] he refused to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[25:32] for a season and that's how it goes with
[25:37] a lot of people today they are caught up
[25:39] in this thing the appeal is well and the
[25:43] think you know what this is a life this
[25:46] is the life that I'm gonna look but they
[25:48] have you seen amen
[25:54] that's not the life when when Jesus was
[26:00] speaking to the disciples and he told
[26:03] them you know what there's gonna come a
[26:05] time that you're going to be put into
[26:08] prison you're gonna be put to death
[26:14] you're going to be separated from your
[26:16] families now they never see ended ran
[26:21] away no there's still something that all
[26:26] of them were killed they were martyred
[26:29] amen
[26:32] so if this was if saving Jesus and and
[26:35] preaching the gospel was the fake why
[26:38] did they whole time
[26:41] Stephen no stone preaching the gospel
[26:44] the people's heart was so hard
[26:47] they couldn't receive the Word of God so
[26:51] I was longing to get when I found says
[26:55] he looked up to heaven and he said Lord
[26:57] Jesus receive my spirit hey man you know
[27:02] there's another land out there
[27:03] there's another place
[27:06] amen and our sister he's gone to the
[27:09] better place you know what kids went to
[27:12] the almost Martin Bernie and he always
[27:16] visited them a circle family you know he
[27:21] went they said spoke the Word of God and
[27:24] and that's some refreshments but he says
[27:27] you know what Mary chose the better part
[27:31] Martha got a happy end she went to go
[27:33] prepare some videos and she was not
[27:35] happy that Mary never come to her hot
[27:37] bath but Jesus said she chose the better
[27:41] part she said there and listen to what
[27:44] Jesus had to say I was thinking of God
[27:47] and Jesus said she chose the better
[27:51] parts so I was sister as chose the
[27:55] better parts she listened to the Word of
[27:59] God
[28:00] she received the Word of God and we got
[28:05] four four preachers the past had three
[28:07] other preachers
[28:08] we are always preaching about the
[28:10] rapture we always preaching about the
[28:13] body change and I was sister was
[28:16] listening and hearing now see chosen
[28:20] better parts nothing waving at faith
[28:24] even when she was not well many many
[28:27] times
[28:28] she always tested God she came for
[28:32] player she requested prayer amen
[28:36] she chose a better part she never played
[28:39] God a lot of people want to blame God
[28:43] you know what what what is this
[28:45] happening to me in and why must you
[28:47] suffer and all this thing they oughta
[28:49] blame God but she trusted and believed
[28:53] in God and we are going to go through
[28:56] these testings and trials in this life
[29:00] well it shows what we are made of what
[29:04] we are trusting who we going to believe
[29:07] him so she listened to the Word of God
[29:11] that promised us eternal life
[29:16] eternal life was promised and she held
[29:21] on to the world and bigger testimony she
[29:26] never wavered they met you believe the
[29:30] Word of God see
[29:33] so I'm saying like we're living in that
[29:35] in a fake world in a false wall
[29:42] you know so I said we know that fifteen
[29:47] twenty fifteen years back the world
[29:50] wasn't in this commission people wasn't
[29:54] in this commission children wasn't in
[29:57] this condition
[29:58] teachers were certain the condition
[30:02] parents wasn't in this condition the
[30:05] parents don't know what to do with the
[30:07] children children don't know what to do
[30:10] with the parents the teachers don't know
[30:14] what to do members they don't know what
[30:19] to do they're not to control them the
[30:28] Bible says people are heady highminded
[30:30] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[30:33] God
[30:36] anything yet something about the gospel
[30:38] of salvation
[30:39] oh they want to live the whole life see
[30:45] any under lovers of pleasure more than
[30:52] look for God when they get sick and lie
[30:57] on the deathbed then the ones in the way
[31:00] is gone I love people in the last stages
[31:05] of the life never want to look for God
[31:08] itself God but when they realize that
[31:13] doctor said sorry there's nothing we can
[31:15] do for you now medical science and
[31:19] doctors and anything can do the best for
[31:22] people but many cases they cannot said
[31:26] sorry there's nothing we can do for you
[31:29] please we're gonna send you home to die
[31:33] many many cases and I'm telling you now
[31:39] this is a true testament people want to
[31:42] find God when they realize that they've
[31:44] come to the end of the life and they're
[31:46] going to die because of the sickness and
[31:49] the disease they want to know what what
[31:56] is going to become off my life so I'll
[31:59] tell you actual facts and actual truths

[32:08] younger brother one above me and one up

[32:35] they never come to serve Him
[32:39] but when the doctor said to my eldest
[32:42] brother he was in Alberta truly when
[32:46] they opened him up and they said sorry
[32:48] there is nothing we can do for you

[32:54] nothing we can do we're gonna send you
[32:56] back to the one stitch above see then

[33:25] family when I time he wanted me to do
[33:31] the funeral in a Christian way and that
[33:35] is Armas factors witnesses yeah he told
[33:39] his family what he realized now there is
[33:42] some truth in Christianity he realized
[33:47] he needed God so I don't know how much
[33:51] he's going to find favor with God but we
[33:54] had to do what he requested in the midst
[33:58] of all a family very news we had a
[34:00] Christian funeral that was in the last
[34:03] stages of his life and then the brother

[35:27] say they can't yet they never had the
[35:32] opportunity to listen at the scene the
[35:34] Word of God in Jesus Christ so that
[35:39] would go on and on I'm living in a time
[35:45] with all the things that's happening in
[35:47] the world for many years now and people
[35:49] want to know what is God why is blood
[35:52] not coming why is he not helping us if
[35:55] he is going why must we suffer how would
[35:59] I say today God has been around amen
[36:04] Lord has been around they wanted God to
[36:09] come down rescue them but when God works
[36:13] he don't work like men God works in a
[36:16] supernatural way amen
[36:20] God was yet people were many ways God
[36:23] blows yeah the Bible tells us in the
[36:28] book of Revelation Ted another mighty
[36:30] angel cake down cloud with the cloud
[36:34] what was it
[36:35] God was yeah blood was opening his word
[36:39] to the people God had people that will
[36:42] receive it and then some some mysteries
[36:46] that were hidden the Bible another
[36:48] mighty angel came down and opened the
[36:50] seals so God was yeah the supernatural
[36:56] was being that scientific evidence that
[37:00] the world was baffled by and the one
[37:03] question what is this and who is that
[37:05] but God was here and people want to know
[37:08] where he's gone
[37:12] God is mindful of the people he says in
[37:15] the book of Malachi chapter 4 we all
[37:18] don't send you Elijah the Prophet before
[37:20] the coming of the Great and dreadful day
[37:23] before i smite the earth with the cast
[37:26] and before my righteous walk on the
[37:29] actions of the wicked
[37:31] I will send me light of the Prophet
[37:34] he will bring the true word to you
[37:36] you're gonna listen to him perhaps jesus
[37:41] said to the young man tell me across it
[37:45] follow me there are people to me help
[37:49] the Word of God and they have taken the
[37:51] cross and following Jesus why the one
[37:54] running away see borders come and worked
[37:57] in the supernatural he was yeah the
[38:05] Bible says in Luke 17 chapter 17 the Son
[38:09] of Man is going to reveal himself as it
[38:13] was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah
[38:15] as it was in the case of Lord the Son of
[38:19] Man which is Jesus Christ would come and
[38:22] reveal himself and he's already done
[38:25] that in the Ministry of this day an
[38:33] organization she never belonged to a
[38:37] denomination she believed the Word of
[38:42] God people must have heard about they're
[38:46] going to some church and what state
[38:48] church is listen and the Saints are
[38:50] prophet and all these things in you know
[38:52] that is a truth and they're stopping go
[38:57] check it out
[38:59] it's all recorded in the Word of God so
[39:04] God has not left us without attending to
[39:07] us and the Bible says he will present
[39:10] himself a glorious church without spot
[39:12] without Rico without British there are
[39:16] people on the face of the earth today as
[39:18] you received a supernatural
[39:21] they have seen the supernatural working
[39:23] of God God says my ways is not your ways
[39:28] and your ways are not my ways he's not
[39:32] going to come down in the way the people
[39:33] want him to come he came in the way he
[39:38] wanted to come and now he's gonna show
[39:41] himself and it's up to the people to
[39:44] believe me to receive it or reject it
[39:49] thanks a lot and the Bible tells us I'm
[39:53] not gonna read the scripture they take
[39:54] longer to people know their story the
[39:57] one says this rich young ruler time and
[40:02] the Bible says he opened his eyes in
[40:05] hell amen
[40:09] he opened his eyes in hell and when he
[40:16] was there he looked at the water and
[40:19] kept the content and out and he saw a
[40:22] friend and he saw laziness
[40:26] hey man and the Bible says that he was
[40:32] fermented he was in the flames of fire
[40:36] and he said to let us please bring me
[40:41] some water they said sorry we can't even
[40:46] bring you water
[40:47] he's a gulf here there's a you know we
[40:51] can't help you
[40:53] hey man let us listen attentively before
[40:58] we close sorry yes sir
[41:16] ever the Word of God is more important
[41:18] so so this man now they couldn't help
[41:21] him and he was in torments and the Bible
[41:26] tells us now here concern he had five
[41:30] brothers and he said to the police sent
[41:35] somebody to one my brother's not to come
[41:37] to this place this already when he got
[41:42] concerned when he realized what he
[41:46] rejected and now he was the determinants
[41:49] of fire he said send somebody to warn my
[41:53] brother's got to come to this place the
[41:57] angel said you know what even if
[41:59] somebody went from the dead they won't
[42:01] believe they got the Word of God the
[42:04] prophet Moses wrote and got the
[42:07] preachers they must gather a man and I
[42:12] believe that's what we must listen to
[42:14] the Word of God and the people that God
[42:17] said to preach the Word of God God is
[42:21] not change God's desire was for men to
[42:26] preach the gospel he that believeth and
[42:29] is baptized shall be saying he that
[42:32] believeth not shall be damned hey back
[42:36] what women want to live their own life
[42:38] they think this is life I'll close up
[42:44] real gap from the book of Romans
[42:50] I'm afraid that you listen attentively
[42:52] because this is the exact condition
[43:01] into the Word of God they don't want to
[43:04] listen to the preachers and the one I
[43:07] had their own way now this is here in
[43:10] the Bible of book of Romans so I'll read
[43:12] this yeah and then I think the rock
[43:14] parish of the program so it says in the
[43:16] book of Romans chapter 1 from verse 16
[43:19] the Apostle Paul went to Rome find you
[43:22] the gospel and this is what he said I am
[43:27] not ashamed of the gospel because it's
[43:31] the power of God that brings salvation
[43:35] to everyone that believes first to the
[43:40] Jews then to the Gentiles
[43:56] a righteousness that is by faith from
[44:01] first to last
[44:03] just as it is written the righteous will
[44:07] live by faith he says yet the rock of
[44:12] God is being revealed from heaven
[44:14] against all godliness wickedness
[44:19] that's what may be known about God is
[44:23] plain to them because God had made plain
[44:25] to them for since the creation of the
[44:28] world God's invisible qualities his
[44:32] eternal power and divine nature has been
[44:35] clearly seen being understood from what
[44:40] was being made so that people are
[44:42] without excuse so what God is saying God
[44:46] has always been revealing himself
[44:49] it's gonna be revealing himself for
[44:54] other than you God they neither
[44:57] glorified him as God
[44:58] don't get paint him but the thinking
[45:02] became futile and the few foolish hearts
[45:05] were darkened although they claim to be
[45:09] wise they became fools and exchanged the
[45:14] glory of the important God for images
[45:18] that look like important human beings
[45:21] and birds and animals and reptiles
[45:24] therefore God gave them over in the
[45:28] sinful desires of the heart to sexual
[45:32] impurity and for the degrading of the
[45:35] bodies one with another they exchanged
[45:39] the truth about God for a lie and
[45:42] worshiped and served created things
[45:46] rather than the Creator who is forever
[45:51] praised because of this God gave them
[45:56] over to shameful lusts even the woman
[46:01] exchanged natural sexual relations for
[46:05] unnatural ones in the same way the men
[46:10] also abandoned natural relations shifted
[46:14] woman and when you train with last one
[46:18] for another been committed shameful acts
[46:23] with other men and the seeing in
[46:26] themselves the due penalty for their
[46:29] error
[46:30] third of all just as they did not think
[46:34] in what was to retain God in the
[46:37] knowledge so God gave them over to a
[46:40] depraved mind amen so that
[46:49] he came up to a depraved mind they have
[46:54] become full with every kind of
[46:56] wickedness evil greed depravity they are
[47:02] full of envy murder strife deceit and
[47:05] malice they are gossips slanderers God
[47:09] Aten insolent arrogant boastful they
[47:17] invent ways of doing evil they disobey
[47:21] the parents they have no understanding
[47:24] no stability no love no mercy are they
[47:29] other than know God's righteous decree
[47:31] that those who do such things deserve
[47:34] death they not only continue to do these
[47:40] things very things which also approve of
[47:45] those who practice them so the Word of
[47:48] God goes on and on and on people have
[47:51] made a choice for the life that they
[47:54] want to live on this earth and
[47:56] blah blah he has made away for us the
[48:00] Bible tells us in the book of Isaiah
[48:02] come let us reason together amen
[48:05] tolya sins be as scarlet they shall be
[48:08] white as snow so there is hope there is
[48:12] cleansing power in the blood of Jesus
[48:15] Christ so if you want to have eternal
[48:18] life we must listen to what the Bible
[48:20] says Jesus I am the bread of life that
[48:23] came down from heaven which any man
[48:25] believe in me shall not die I am the way
[48:29] the truth and the life no man cometh
[48:32] unto the father but by me but there's
[48:35] not many other ways to God only through
[48:38] Jesus Christ and in the day what are we
[48:42] gonna leave this earth we will come to
[48:44] know the truth then maybe you will not
[48:46] know it now and that rich young ruler
[48:49] found out that he refused to follow
[48:52] Jesus Christ he refused eternal life and
[48:55] he ended up in hell so bring that God
[48:57] bless you
[49:12] thank you for turning we'd like to
[49:16] continue we have to get you just believe
[49:36] the messages that the siblings wanted to
[49:38] pass on shall start with Rajat mum you
[49:45] were the truest dearest more than the
[49:48] whole world to me

[50:01] gift from God so much beauty love and
[50:04] patience you possessed you touched my
[50:07] heart in so many ways the strength to

[58:57] your parents at a young age having to be
[59:00] brought up by their extended family
[59:02] having to fend for yourself most of your
[59:05] life
[59:05] losing your pop name like saying goodbye
[59:08] to your children and your grandchild I
[59:11] could see the pain in your eyes but it
[59:14] was clouded by the overwhelming love
[59:16] that never failed to shine you did the
[59:20] best you could do and that best is a
[59:22] benchmark we all aspire to be to be able
[59:27] to provide food and shelter for almost
[59:29] every one of your family at some point
[59:32] in their lives but above all your
[59:34] unwavering love yes there were arguments
