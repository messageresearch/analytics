right and joy ought to be flowing out of us amen amen if we're finding that we are struggling and we are have to come to church and then pump ourselves of just to act joyful something is wrong and we need to pray Lord let your joy flow from within me amen wherever I go I want to be a joyful person amen Wherever I Go the people I meet they must experience the joy that I have amen amen amen and no matter what trial I face no matter how much I get stressed out amen I have this Joy because out of the innermost being shall flow forth rivers of Living Waters so what what am I saying you're not governed by your circumstances but there's a word within you amen that Fountain is Flowing out amen glory be to his name thank you Jesus amen hallelujah amen let's turn to the Bible amen Ephesians chapter 5 Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 25 Hallelujah we'll speak this morning on a glorious church amen that's what Christ is looking for amen Christ is looking for a glorious church amen amen you see everything is coming now to the end and at the end everything reaches its Glory the world is looking for their Superman yes amen so everything is reaching the climax now and everything is coming to its full glory and when you see that happening in the natural you be under expectation to happen in the spiritual amen Ephesians 5 and 25 reads husbands love your wives now that is not a suggestion amen that's an instruction that's a command husbands love your wives how even as Christ also loved the church amen how did he love the church and gave himself for it amen so the love of a husband is a sacrificial one okay but now we're focusing on the love of Christ and the church he gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse so sanctify means to purify and cleanse means to wash so he wants to purify and wash it with the washing of Water by the word amen that he might present it to himself a glorious Church am amen Christ is going to present to himself a glorious church not having spot that's not having Mark even the mark of the beast or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish amen this is the body of Believers that Christ is going to present to himself amen amen Revelation 19 and7 then you can be seated Revelation 19 and seven says let us be glad and rejoice that also is not a suggestion that comes now amen we need joyful people we need people full of praise full of Power full of Glory let us be glad and rejoice amen sometimes no all the time and give honor to him oh I worship you almighty God Amen whether the music is playing or whether it's not playing amen even if the song leader stops a song your worship ought to emanate from within you amen glorifying his name amen hallelujah we can't be like a cold engine back in the day we have to crank it yes crank it amen hallelujah not in this late hour by now we ought to know how to worship God Amen if we want to experience a greater glory we've got to give him a greater praise amen so let us rejoice let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him notice these are instructions not suggestions for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready amen amen you may be seated the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word praise the Lord now if you contrast those two one he's telling you that the Lord is presenting himself a glorious church and then here in Revelation 19 it's telling us that the wife is making herself ready so what is it is he preparing us or are we making ourselves ready on our own but the mystery of it is that it is he in us he's doing the work in US amen he himself is now in us and that's how the bride is making our ready allowing the work of the Holy Spirit now how many of you are enjoying 2024 amen hallelujah amen hallelujah 2024 wow it's only the what day today 21st and so much happening in the world Amen Bricks now as 10 members as of first January they had five but they now have a double portion amen South Africa took Israel to court yeah amen and now amen hallelujah South Africa also now taking the US and UK and and and the Allies accusing them of being involved in the Israel war against the Palestinian people so South Africa very active this year amen us and UK where their allies are bombed Yemen because of the trade route they you know in the Red Sea the world economic Forum has commenced in Davos started the agenda you remember they said you'll own nothing and you'll be happy it started their thing amen Iran has attacked Iraq Pakistan has attacked Iran amen hallelujah Russia is still engaged in a war against Ukraine amen Israel is still in a war against Hamas and it's only the 21st of January amen things are heating up amen things are speeding up that's right amen I hope we're not hiding in a corner somewhere wondering how we going to make our next five R amen hallelujah it's homegoing time amen and now here we read that Christ loved the church and he gave himself for her now the reason he gave himself for it is to cleanse it to Sanctified and to present himself a glorious church I want you to know that that is going to start on the earth before he presented himself this glorious Church suddenly your UNG glorious life is not going to become glorious because you had a body change the only thing that you should be lacking is the resurrection of the Saints and a new body but before that you shall be glorious amen I don't think you're getting it am amen hallelujah I also want you to understand what I am telling you about this year about what is happening in the spiritual realm I am not talking about your glorified body that we can't do anything about I am talking about the church being a glorious Church on the earth now amen amen I'm talking about a church who is so Amen in control by the holy spirit amen totally surrendered by the to the Holy Spirit and totally amen hallelujah under the leadership of the Holy Spirit Christ he's going to present himself a glorious church but before the Rapture Comes This bride is going to go out of here a Victorious church amen a glorious church we are not a defeated people we are not a defeated Army amen hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the Lord so we don't have a spot we don't have a wrinkle no such thing and we should be holy and without blemish now last week we were focusing on glorifying me with the glory that Jesus has given given me and we find how did we get that glory is because the father had given Jesus that glory and he says the glory you have given me I have given them amen now Jesus say something very particular there he says with the glory that I had with thee from before the foundation of the world remember Jesus is in a three-dimensional World okay he's in a body that has limitations but he's saying glorify me with the Glory that I had with thee from before the foundation of the world Amen what glory is that amen Jesus is remembering something now remember yeah if we read in St John 17:1 it says these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come what hour was this the ending of his life what hour was it the end time the end time for the bridegroom come on now catch it it's the end time for the bridegroom and at the end time he is looking for a higher level of Glory it's the end time for the Bride of Jesus Christ and what is Jesus prayer father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son may also glorify Thee I wonder if the prayer of the Bride should not be father glorify your bride that the bride May glorify thee amen hallelujah and as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh now watch this is very important watch what he is detailing he has power over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him amen amen and this is life eternal that they may now he's defining eternal life what is it eternal life that they might Know Thee the only true God in Jesus Christ whom he thou has sent amen yes Lord I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was amen now back up there bit in first verse two he has power over All Flesh he has power on the Earth but I want the glory where I have power both in heaven and on Earth amen that's what Jesus is asking for take away my limitation I had a glory with you from the beginning what glory is that you ask amen hallelujah amen you know the scriptures John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us amen let's read some of it amen let's turn to John 1 for those of you that don't know it we want to read it and see what Glory Jesus is actually asking the father for what is he missing we're coming to our part now but we just need to background this because as is he so is she in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God this is not talking about Jesus the logos the same was in the beginning with God now watch Jesus is now this part verse three all things were made by himen and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shined in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not amen so Jesus is having reflections of his former [Music] s let's drop down to verse 14 and the word Jesus was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen John bear witness of him and cried this was he of whom I speak he that cometh after me is prefer before me for he was before me amen so even every Elijah the Prophet knows that Jesus existed amen come on now amen John is saying he was before me but John is 6 months older than Jesus but they are talking by Revelation amen amen hallelujah they know who this is amen hallelujah praise the lord we can't bypass now you see all of it is in chapters amen Colossians chapter 1 let's go Colossians chapter 1 let's learn about the head and and what he's talking about here Colossians 1 and verse 16 just to show you now what Jesus is okay maybe we'll read from verse 14 then you'll know who we talking about Amen in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are on earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Jesus and for Jesus Jesus is before all things and by Jesus all things consist Jesus is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in Jesus should all the fullness dwell amen no Jesus is just a one part of the Trinity of gods but here the Bible is telling you that even if they believe in Trinity of God's father son holy spirit all three was dwelling in Jesus amen yes and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself I say whether there be things in Earth or things in heaven as sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now had he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy now here's the key for you he's doing it all for you to present you holy and unblamable and unprovable in his sight unreprovable in his sight that word holy and unblamable you got to pay attention to it because that's what you were predestinated for we'll read it now if you continue in the Faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard watch there's a part for you to play you got to be have your faith grounded settled be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven where of I Paul am a made a minister one more chapter I'm giving you out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses here Hebrews chapter 1 amen praise the Lord amen Hebrews chapter 1 God who had sunright times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets had in this last days spoken unto us by his son whom he had appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world you see yes amen through Jesus he made the worlds who being the bright of his glory amen and the express image of his person yes amen and upholding All Things by the word of his power amen I want you to connect this with one thing the glory you have given me I have given them yes amen you uphold your situations whatever you're going through but the word of your mouth Yes Lord yes Lord he is holding All Things by the word of his power Glory you've given me Father I've given them oh yes amen thank you Lord now if Jesus is the express image of God we are the express image of Jesus yes amen and we hold all things by the word of his power yes when he had made himself purged by when he had by himself purged our sin sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high being made much better than the angels has yet by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they For unto which of the Angels okay we we know he's what he's going to talk about there verse six when he bringeth the first begot me into the world this is Jesus let all the angels of God worship Him Hallelujah verse 8 now watch now this is God talking everybody agree this is God talking watch what God now says but of the son he said thy Throne oh God the father is talking about the son everybody following thy Throne oh God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the septer of thy kingdom amen thou has loved righteousness and atth iniquity therefore God even thy God had anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows and thou Lord amen in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth amen and the heavens are the work of thine hands hallelujah amen they Shall Perish but thou remainest and they all shall All Shall wax old as do a garment and as a Vester shalt thou fold them up and shall be changed now watch very important I want you to catch this verse 13 14 but to which of the Angels said at any time sit at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol and this is now if you don't know the work of the Angels get what the Bible is saying angels are they not all ministering Spirits sent for to minister for them who shall be hes of Salvation amen amen amen you need a ministering Spirit you need a call amen hallelujah amen amen didn't we learn that when Rafa comes in on the scene he sends the angel of God and the angel of God is coming by your neighborhood to connect with your faith amen so angels are ministering Spirits so if you need Gyra will Gyra send an angel amen maybe we have entertained angels una AWS amen praise the Lord now amen there's there's more scriptures you can go to Genesis 1 and see what they were talking about how God through Jesus Christ created the heavens and the Earth amen I think we read enough scriptures to cover what I was saying amen now you know what Jesus meant when he said glorify me with the glory I had with thee amen amen that's what I was trying to show you there now we need to go to verse 20 of St John 17 to progress now neither pray I for these alone but for them which also Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one amen i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and the world may know that thou has sent me and has Lov loveth me love them as thou has loved me father now yeah yes I am proposing to you this is Jesus marriage proposal and he's asking the father permission to marry you father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am amen amen are you ears of the father yes so any man must ask the girl's father permission to marry amen do you both share the same father we of the father father joints with the son amen hallelujah father I will where them whom thou has given me be with me where I am why will you want to take a woman to yourself if you're not going to marry her that they may behold my glory amen which thou has given me for thou loves me before the foundation of the world Amen amen let's just read this next quote because I need you to see what the prophet is saying about you maybe he's saying about you if you can connect with I was thinking today that the best that I can remember the tide of spiritual enthusiasm that's passion is rising high in Phoenix than any time I've ever seen it amen amen but that's only amongst two or three who are gathered in his name that's how it feels this morning amen it may feel like uh there's a lot of people here but only two or three may be gathered in his name amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen hallelujah you know you got to say Amen to the word yes amen because right now you can grieve the minister and pull him out of that realm amen and make him pull out a belt that he don't want to really pull out so I'm talking to you as spiritual people and showing you a glorious church I'm trying to show you a high level of a glorious Church a mature Church yes that's right and now somebody's trying to pull me down and say spank me spank me please you know you get naughty children you don't really want to hit them but they get to a point where the only way to get the attention of the spirit yes is to wack the flesh because where is memory in your spirit if you want the child to really remember what I'm telling you don't do that then you got to attack the flesh so that it's ingrained in the spirit then they stop it yes okay but we don't want to be doing that this morning let me go back to my higher level going up to the high places I'm going up to the high places Now That Glory that is in John 17:22 is both the radiance of God's character and the status of us being children of God now I want to say this because that's why I'm talking to a mature church this morning when something is entrusted to you you've got to have the grace to carry it amen am you got to know how to work worthy of it yes so our position should be fill me with your presence fill me with your glory yes I must have you at this time father the hour is come amen we can't see what Jesus is talking about in Matthew 24 and not be moved when we see the current events transpiring amen God is fixing to fill the bride with his glory and bring her to such a glorious state that she'll be an invincible Army amen amen amen but you got to have the grace to carry it yes amen I'm saying he's going to fill his bride in a with such glory in a way that we have never experienced before in the 21st century this is where I feel the separating line will come we can all come into His presence and enjoy the presence and enjoy the benefits of being in his presence we can be healed have encounters with the Holy Ghost amen and that's all we may receive but the separation is coming now between those who will allow God to take full control of their soul mind heart amen their entire being yes Lord in order for God to finish the plan that he had in his mind from before the foundation of the world Amen he's going to take control of your body yes Lord he's got to take control of your spirit amen he got to take control of your soul yes Lord amen if you go to read the three-fold purpose in Christ the mystery you'll see that you are a key player in end time prophecy he must have the preeminence in a people amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah I'm so glad that he chose me aren't you glad that he chose us Amen to reflect his glory amen amen oh thank you he must now fully manifest himself through a people and the people that carry his glory his anointing his presence in a way that has never been seen in the last 60 years the world is about to witness this yes your friends are about to witness this your family is about to witness this your brother and your sister is about to witness to Glory unleash in way like never seen in the last 60 years the last time the people on Earth would have seen something like this would have been in the days of the Prophet William Brandon William brandham came with a message and his message came to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers according to Malachi 4: 5 and 6 young people you got to know this we've had a prophet that's walked out of the pages of the Bible yes amen amen hallelujah he came to reveal the mystery of God according to Revelation 10 1-7 yes amen and we which have believed the message of the hour and have allowed the word to have a work in our lives amen hallelujah and what it was intended to do and now experiencing the full effect of the message the message is not growing weaker but it is growing stronger amen hallelujah I'm allowing the message to take its full have its full potential in me amen the message may be weakening to some people but to me the message is getting stronger and stronger because there's a group of people willing to surrender their lives give God praise if you're one of them amen hallelujah amen we are about to experience a full power of the message of the hour and what it what is what it was intended to do amen because we have we have witnessed the power and the demonstration of the Gospel now it's time for the full manifest presence of the Lord to be seen in the bride what does it says in these last days the true bride that's Christ seed will come to the headstone you remember we put up that picture yes that picture is probably still there you can put it after we read this quote as she kns The Headstone what's the headstone love amen as she kns it she will be the Super church amenah amen that's a glorious Church yes a super race as she nears him amen amen if you look at that picture you'll see we are not at the bottom we are right on top amen nearing The Headstone I'm saying nearing The Headstone but I'm telling you the headstone has come crying Grace that's what the message Shalom was all about crying Grace a double portion Grace to this end time people if we didn't receive a double portion Grace because you know they say the headstone is coming crying Grace Grace we in latest year would not have made it if we didn't receive a double portion anointing of Grace they in the bride will be so much like him yes what we talking about they express image now of Jesus they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image that's his image now right there will be even in his very image you got to be in His image for the next part now in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God can put that picture back up now amen you can see we are not at the bottom we right on top where the headstone is say double portion Grace is coming upon us because leosia is dark Leos here is demon possessed hell has been Unleashed upon the earth and the Bible says if it were possible the elect would be deceived but it's not possible because we have a double Grace amen amen come on now come on demon powers are pulling you back down get back up amenallah amen so the highest form of Glory of God's glory that can be revealed is through an end time people yes amen God can't fully reveal his glory through lutherans through wesan through Pentecostals amen that's why he sent a message to prepare a body of people that he can fully Express his glory through yes amen amen all that he want to achieve is to be expressed through us when God can have the preeminence in our lives amen that's the highest form of his glory oh thank you Lord to be Reve in the highest form of creation Hallelujah you see if you read Genesis there you'll see it's telling you that in the cool of the day Adam heard God coming what was that sound like the same sound in Acts chapter 2 it was like a mighty rushing wind oh thank his sound does not change yeah Adam said I heard your sound in the garden and I hid myself so Adam knew when he was is coming amen like a mighty rushing wind amen amen hallelujah and what was coming his glory was coming down when the Praises go up his glory comes down yes amen Prophet said that in the cool of the day Adam and Eve would present themselves before the Lord and His glory would [Music] descend amen he wasn't descending to any other life form he was coming down to the highest form of creation so I tell you from the beginning of the world even up to from the fall till now God didn't have a people that he could come and descend with his glory but in the end time he now as a people back in the image of God again amen God has worked to achieve this through seven Church ages amen hallelujah am praise the lord we are not a we defeat the church we know who we are amen amen hallelujah we know that is ongoing time we are right at the head we are right at the top that's that to me let me tell you is the end of the Gentile dispensation there's no long future for you right amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen You' rather go to your father now and quote their John 17 father if you saw already you need to go to your father and say father I would that she be where I am if you don't know what I'm talking about in plain English you rather get married while you can I just gave you a scripture to quote back to your father father I would that she be where I am [Music] amen so Christ wants to have the preeminence in our life now remember all that was in God he pour into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into his church am so we can give praise glory to God through songs Through words writings we know that but the best way to let a amen the best way is to let his glory come down amen through our lives so God God will appreciate the songs God will appreciate the testimonies of you giving him glory but I'm saying there's a higher form of Glory for you you can glorify God in a greater way is when you said let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me amen fill my way every day with love yes Lord as I walk with the Heavenly you should say Lord Reveal Your Glory through me these are your hands touch through them heal through them this is your feet possess territory fre through them walk oh God these are your lips these are your tongue this is your tongue speak the words amen speak my Lord speak my Lord speak and I'll be quick to answer thee these are your ears I will shut my ears to every ungodly thing I will open up my ear to he that hasn't hear Let Him hear what the spirit is saying to the church these are your eyes Lord this is your eyes amen even though she looks like a Coca-Cola bottle I will not lust Lord these are your eyes amen praise the Lord amen some like buddies amen we can give glory to God through songs we said but the greatest form that you can let him Express his glory through you is to say say Lord unveil yourself through me hallelujah amen so I lay down my own will my own plan I invite you to sit on the throne of my heart so that you can fulfill your will for my life and complete the plan you have for me I feel that we should say that say Lord I lay down my own will Lord I lay down my own will I invite you I invite you to set up your throne set up your throne in my heart in my heart so that you can fulfill so that you can fulfill your will your will for my life for my life and complete the plan complete the plan you have for me you have for me shine your light through me I want you to know that you are God's most prized possession you are the most prized possession now at the end time all creation is resting on you coming to Perfection to reveal the glory of of God Amen Christ is going to present himself a glorious church amen and I I say it's already started through 7 Church ages we are now at the Pinnacle amen that's right and they without us cannot be made perfect so the they are waiting on us yes amen you know you know the person you're crying about you are grieving about that you lost hear me now and maybe over the next few years we don't know how long the Lord may take to come but you may lose loved ones you may go through deep depression Darkness sorrow there's nothing you can do to bring them back right and there's nothing you can do to go ahead of your time to them but the Bible says that all creation is waiting on you you am waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God even the one that you are crying about dead in the grave is waiting for you to come to your Perfection so they can get out of the [Music] Grave so you are God's most prized possession all that God owns or has control over whether dominions kingdoms principalities animal life plant life bird life fish life God doesn't want to uh Express his glory fully through them God doesn't want to fully incarnate himself in a lion God doesn't want to fully incarnate himself in uh in the big five he wants to fully incarnate himself in the highest form of creation you are the highest form of creation on the earth you are God's most beloved possession The Joy the Bible says the joy that was set before him he endured the cross he left heaven to redeem you now if you leave something valuable which is heaven all control all power all authority and come down to the Earth to redeem something on the earth then which one is more valuable the one that you're coming down for has more value for example if somebody kidnaps your child even though your your 5 million is valuable to you and you got that in the bank and they ask for a ransom of 5 million you will give that 5 million so that you can redeem your son so which is more valuable the son Christ left everything for you I'm saying you are the most valuable possession he left it all amen so we read there what the glory was read John 1 now if we go to Revelation 13 let's go to Revelation 13:8 you got to know that in the beginning you got to know the mystery between man and wife that's where we read Ephesians chapter 5 there right and all that that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world okay why are we reading this I want you to extract a truth in this verse there are names written in the Book of Life in the Lamb's Book of Life and the lamb was slain from before the foundation of the world and Jesus is saying glorify me with the glory that I had with you from before the foundation of of the world now you got to know that you are a hidden Mystery in God Amen you are hidden Mystery in Christ so when Christ is saying glorify me with the glory that I had with you from before the foundation of the world is unlocking a hidden mystery about the bride because there was also somebody else's name in the book of life before the foundation of the world what am I talking about you can find the hidden Mystery in Adam and Eve Eve was locked up inside of Adam yes the bride was locked up inside of Christ amen the woman was locked up in a man and revealed when Adam was put to sleep and taken from his side when Adam had Glory with God at the beginning Eve when he inside of him before Eve was taken out the glory of God would come and Adam had the glory of God but Eve was inside of him not yet expressed but she was part of him but the Bible is clear to state that in spirit the man was both male and female she was always a part of his being Man created in the image of God now man taken from the side amen woman taken from the side of man so we know that man is in the image of God and woman is in the image of a man and all the sisters said amen man is in the image of God woman is in the image of a man right so we find here man in his right mind and right position in Christ as Christ The Head and the woman being submissive to the man amen amen hallelujah and the children being submissive to parents that's God's order for the family amen you see you'll never win you'll never win at home if your home is in turmoil if this order is not there if a woman is not sub submissive or subject to the husband there there will not be a peace and Harmony in that home if a man doesn't love his wife according to how the Bible is saying and give himself for the family that there will be no peace in the home if the children are unruly and not obeying the parents there will be no peace in the home therefore we take the word of God and we submit under the word and we follow the guideline of the word but that man must also have a head which is Christ he must be under subjection of Christ watch now as in the Statue of a perfect man I think you saw that pictures now so it says God has place these things into the church talking about those seven virtues and patent it by showing that each individual has these possesses these qualities each individual possesses this these qualities it's very important why I'm reading this now amen right so the man who possesses all of these qualities here's what he saying this being when it's completed is the Church of God going to Rapture everybody caught there you want to know who's going I'm telling you who's going in the Rapture Amen brother Bram is telling you this being when it's completed with all seven virtues and headstone coming down is the Church of God going to Rapture and this being Inc completed is a servant of God in the Church of God that's going in the Rapture amen amen so if you if you ever ask yourself the question I wonder if I'm going in the Rapture measure yourself against that image if you are lining after that image you are going in the Rapture amen that's the image God is taking into the Rapture like I said before the only one going into the Rapture is Jesus that image is the life of Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord here here again to reiterate so when you surrender your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues then you're a living Tabernacle then people look and say that's a man full of virtue knowledge he believes the word Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness full of the love of the Holy Ghost see there he is walking around what is it a stature that that unbelievers can look and say there is a Christian amen there is a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about you never seen a Kinder sweeter godlier person you're sealed a sealed shows on both sides whether you're going or coming you see the seal just the same there you are when a man or woman possesses this then the Capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost hallelujah thank you Lord then the word coming from here manifests itself to each one of these beings you see the word wants to manifest himself through each one of these beings and makes this complete being a tabernacle of the Living God a walking living example of Christianity what Christ was these people are because his life is in there amen amen they are in Christ and their life is dead and it in Christ through God and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost you reckon yourself dead then you're born of Faith then virtue and all these other things is added to your perfect living image of God am then God through that he brought also seven Church ages right seven steps that he brought building his individual Into His Image he's built a complete Church in His image and at the resurrection this complete body will be raised up to live with him forever because it is a bride amen here's what I'm saying now I I said this earlier but here's the quote he says these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us how many if you know a loved one who died in Christ these people are depending and waiting on us they can wait two more hours man this new movie came out these people are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to Perfection amen you see I'm trying to show it's not a thing after the Rapture yes that's right amen yes some people only believe they'll be perfected only in the new body yeah what the prophet is saying these people are waiting on us depending on us so this church has got to come to Perfection Amen in order to bring what the resurrection and they under Souls under the altar waiting for the church to come to its Perfection then when Christ does come and up here when the pyramid cap does come the pyramid itself the body of Christ will have to be honed not just some Creed or doctrine or something other will come through it'll have to be so perfectly like Christ till when he comes he and that ministry will fit right smack together then will come the Rapture the homegoing I'm closing now and I'm going to close with the story I'm talking about a glorious Church the prophet saw a preview of The Bride and he saw the first church come up and she was a glorious Church she was a church full of Power full of authority she was marching to the bead of honored Christian Soldiers she was marching in rank and file she was dressed properly a garment was white and spotted undefiled oh yes amen but he says then he he saw this church come up and then he says he saw the mor Church come again he saw the modern Church come and then he saw that she was like a witch dancing to rock and roll music and she didn't have any clothes on and she had two pieces of of I don't know what it was but she was covering a back in a front and she was walking he says I've never seen such a more vulgar sight you go look at most churches today and you'll see what the prophet saw vulgar and he said Lord he didn't want to look anymore and he said this church well went this way and it went on down and then he says all at once I heard that music come back again he says it was a music like a beat similar to Onward Christian Soldiers and he saw this bride coming up again and she was she was the like the same church that you saw at the beginning remember Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts he saw a dress the same he saw March the same he saw her with the same power the same Authority amen and as she's marching and going he says I saw one or two of them get out of line and I screamed stay in line amen he says as I'm screaming stay in line he says I came out of this thing so I'm showing you there's a glorious church now there's a glorious church if you are out of line I ask you to come back in line amen amen come back in line all creation is depending on you Amen in the message the hours Tim here what the prophet is saying 297 look there must come a true seed there has got to be because he's coming for a bride without spot or wrinkle he's coming for it a word Vindicated bride should be a little bitty group as in the days of Noah where in eight Souls were saved so shall it be in the coming of the son of man you're in the message recognizing your day and his message he says the power of God will put the power of God will put the people in The Bride the spirit of God which is the word of God will put the bride in a place amen cuz she'll recognize a position in the word then she's in Christ and the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it he says in the message the identification of Christ in all ages you're just as much alive tonight as you were when you talk to the woman at the well the the prophet is now praying he's saying Lord you are just alive this morning as you were when you spoke to the woman at the well it's God manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and husband is the self same self flesh amen these two are one and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word amen amen the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word so that the word and the church becomes the same the word in the church making it the bride the last sign God identifying himself the word in the church this uniting time to see churches unit in Nations uniting it's a uniting time of God and his bride too I believe the bride of Christ is called I believe she's sealed in the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is here they're waiting for the Dynamics that will take her out of the earth into glory in the Rapture he is the Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he ends them to us just before the marriage the wedding supper when is he ending after during when is he ending our love gifts before the wedding [Music] supper and here he says the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise up up amen just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his Holiness to take a flight into to the skies the Dynamics is the holy spirit yeah what the prophet is saying now I'm closing he says this glorious church that we've been talking about maybe since the beginning of this year why can't we have have that here on eth and P Street why can't we have it here in Green [Music] Manor corner of green or a hope is it hope what what street is running [Music] across why can't we have that here on Eighth and penth Street we've got the qualifications amen how many of you feel qualified Amen brother Bram is asking Bram Tabernacle question question now why can't we have the Glorious Church in this church we've got the people who love God identify now wouldn't we all like to have a real Bible Church a real Bible Church where all the spiritual gifts were set in order everything making manifest just exactly the way it should be wouldn't that be wonderful now you're going to have to sacrifice not money you're going to have to sacrifice what some of your own ideas you're going to have to sacrifice some time in prayer amen you're going to have to sacrifice maybe a stubborn will to break down in humility the whole Christian move is sacrificial he that will follow me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me daily is that right how often do you have to sacrifice every day amen Paul said he died daily every day he died in the message what does it take to make a Christian life now if the Church of the Living God which is the Pillar of Truth God intended this church to be a powerful Church a glorious Church a church that the whole world could look upon as the bride of Christ well accepted and espoused and to live live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that God would be proud of this church to present it to Christ at the coming of the Lord every place we go we see Jesus see his living presence flowing like a radiant light from his glorious Church of the Living God ask your now we read that scripture Ephesians if Christ were pres if Christ was to present you right now to himself what kind of bride will he be presenting to himself right now if Christ had to present you before himself because if you put up our opening scripture then Christ is going to present himself a glorious church amen and we know the Dynamics is the Holy Ghost the Dynamics will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost and my desire my prayer is Lord Fill Me Oh Lord more of your presence amen more of your anointing yes I want the glory I want the glory that Jesus has given me I wanton the glory that I had
