we can see testimony is coming from amen from different directions some receiving healing amen some on the spiritual side some have been restored amen back to the faith amen and some of us have been blessed in the natural so I just wanted to testify um during the course of life you know the answer was completely by faith I didn't have any um indication of whether I was going to have clients or or

guarantee a weekend there when I decided to take the step of faith and to go on my own so I'd like to thank God for that amen he knows how to provide for his children he knows how to make a way if you

he took that book of redemption they all gladly bow down before him and John who typed the end time people bow down before him as well amen so he had a revelation of the one true God and you know that's the fundamental revelation is the Pinnacle of all Revelations who Jesus is amen and be so grateful that we know who he is amen so I pray the amen that everybody is well trust in the Lord amen thank you for the testimonies and suggestion good to see you back in the house of the Lord let's give the Lord a good anchor of praise for that amen we haven't seized to pray for you we still continue to pray for the Deliverance of Brother Joseph amen so keep believing and keep holding a positive confession amen amen my desire is that we never have a negative testimony amen and we look to the end result so the parent teaches us in Vision a well body and he says step towards the world body every day Proclaim I am healed every day proclaiming is already healed amen Envision the brothers so well and so perfect Envision him amen having a family amen and I've been telling you right the vision amen and I tell you we are I can't say we are amazed we're just standing back and watched an amazing God do impossible things in our lives amen and those that are catching it and you'll find more testimonies are coming from the ones that are catching it all right they are raising up in favor and you are seeing more testimonies in those areas and those people that are believing it so don't think amen that God is only moving in that family no they are raising up amen amen they are thinking God at his word amen and they are seeing the results amen week in and week out amen so we have some amazing testimonies coming forth amen not only in the spiritual we are seeing the Holy Spirit Will awaken us spiritually yes we are seeing the Holy Spirit heal we are seeing the Holy Spirit come and meet physical needs we are seeing the Holy Spirit desire Hearts amen amen now share this testimony with you amen so you know brother Allison was here last week and uh he called me about after seven on Friday night last week Friday and he told me you know what I need you to come and pray uh his baby was not well and he says the baby's eyes are rolling back now you know the brother was not faithful in church hasn't been here for months amen so I found it all that he would call me because he never officially told me that his fellowshipping here neither did he make me aware that I was his Pastor under this ministry so I didn't feel he was under the covering amen so remember I'm trying to teach you something here if you don't have to recovering we are not obligated to you so think about it it's after seven on a Friday night I got a young family as well so I have to make a decision to stay with my family or whether to respond to the call but I hear the brothers plea and his wife you know in the background and I see it's urgent so I tell my wife I need to go but I know now they're telling me the situation that the baby's eyes is rolling back and maybe me driving there I may not get to the baby on time so I say and I say Lord and I start to pray and I say father send your angel before me and let him touch his baby that before I get that the baby will be well that was a simple prayer amen and I start I live and I go there so he was at his uh Auntie's house I get to the house and the baby is not there in the lounge they come and they greet me amen and very nice Christian family that his aunt and uncle were they came greeted me found out who I was and you know we're having a little conversations so ask them where's the baby and they bring the baby and they lay the baby on the table dining room table and here's the baby gurgling and happy and I don't see a sick baby so I asked him what happened I said the baby looks fine to me you'll call me to pray for the baby they said yes boss the baby just went out and the baby seems to be fine and he has an answer to pray I said Lord before I get the letter maybe already be well amen hallelujah and he shall give his angels charge over there Jesus said I can pour Ten Thousand Angels right now amen so how much more Sons and Daughters of God Amen amen and I'm telling you the miraculous yeah so yeah the brother comes to church last week Sunday you're all seen him here in church and after the preaching of the world you know we've been singing and such an anointing amen you spoke on Entertaining Angels and we know even we are speaking about the Holy Spirit and we go outside and the brother comes back after he greets Us in the line he comes back to greet me and he tells me you know the wife and the child is still at home and he tells me the baby to had a rough night sleeping yes brother Sunny has a weapons he's standing right next to me amen and something tells me speak to this brother and I tell you brother the reason why your baby is like this is because your wife is fearful and I don't know why I'm telling him these things yes I think she's projecting this thing onto the child the child could be a month old but the fear of the mother is coming upon the child and therefore your child is reacting in this way so the brother is kind of looking at me and he's after I finish with him and I said please tell her that she needs to pray every time she feels this way and yes brother son is standing next to me and I said brother sunny so okay I'll tell you why so he spoke to me back and he said you know what my wife is very fearful right now just last week she was caught in a crossfire and a shooting now who designed that to him it wasn't me amen who designed that all right amen amen amen come on people amen me non-human ability I wouldn't know that that fear amen I talked to brother sunny and I said brother did you just hear what he said and while I'm driving and I'm thinking after that the prophet says the spirit of ananias and Sapphire will come back into the church what was that the spirit to design the hearts of the people what did Paul do to analyze and Survivor or Peter he said remember they came and sold a bit of land amen and he deserved their heart they said this is all resolved it for remember it was all of their money to keep but because they got the church involved because you say you're under the covering of this church you cannot lie to the holy spirit amen so the spirit of God can design things amen and I ask you to be sensitive to the spirit of God in this time amen amen because he's moving in a way now to take us past just the teaching of the word he is bringing that word into manifestation how many of you know of uh people who study to be lawyers doctors and spend the whole life studying and they are so highly qualified they can't even get jobs so all that they learned they never put into practice they just become academics we don't want to be that way in the message amen just academics because I tell you you know in the revelation of the Seven Seals when it comes time when you're meeting the enemy on the Battleground what is it going to do for you you must have an experience amen the Holy Ghost can only take what is Holy Ghost given for to bring those things to remembrance all those things that you've been learning all those things you've been feeding on and I tell you the bride has been fed enough to give a Rapture in faith how much more do we want to be fed we've had enough word to give us a rapturing faith in this hour we the holy ghost that Dynamics to come and strike that mechanics amen and I tell you this is the year for it you heard me say it amen since last year I'm expecting a great outpouring I'm expecting you to meet the angel of God I'm expecting greater miracles you have the testimony on Wednesday brother Joshua testify those of you are not sure [Music] how displacement is going to was laying in a coma and he came before brother Joshua under the Joshua as soon as he learned he said come let's pray and he left it the next time he meets the policeman was on Monday last week and so happened we were having Fellowship during the day I know that Joshua was delayed because of the fellowship some of you know what I mean when you get into talking with somebody the time goes amen so it was one after five but the Joshua was telling me the reason why we were delayed is because if he had gone any earlier he would not have met his brother so the conversation was delayed and what were we talking about the things of God we were talking about how the holy spirit is moving and what we are expecting to see we were talking about our vision for the church and what we're expecting to see in a greater way for each and every one of us amen and so when he gets back to work he meets up with that policeman and the police mentality in the testimony and he says the very same day that you pray my daughter got up from that coma what is that teacher the people's healing are tied to our dedication yeah and our faith in the sower amen okay so how much more prayer that we need to be amen amen absolutely two weeks ago we were chatting over lunch Amen brother Joshua and I and we talk loud if you know us probably our wives will tell you they're always telling us why you talk so loud just you know lower your voice so we didn't even know we were Fellowship big and we're talking about the angel of God and we're talking about you know all the revelation of the world and we're feasting the end little do we know behind us was a pastor and he was listening to our conversation when we get up to leave because it stops brother Josh when he says you know what I enjoy the conversation you were having amen so people are listening amen so always be a witness something we could have said could have triggered something in their hearts amen and we didn't know we didn't plan to do that amen we always talk loud amen so be bold in your faith amen and I know all of you are testifying and you're always witnessing but greater than that living life amen amen amen I tell you if you do nothing else for the rest of this year seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost the most powerful thing you can do seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost I know if you know what the proper of God says he says nobody can have a birth or nobody can be pregnant and have a birth without knowing about it so if we have to ask you have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed you can't wonder amen you must know the experience which woman I gave birth I didn't know she was giving birth she was screaming so I'm asking you evaluate Our Lives say Lord I've come this far I want to know without a shadow of a doubt I have the Holy Ghost that's the only token we know for the Rapture amen I'll give us to shame and we're so happy to have him with us this morning let's keep my hand a welcome amen care is an anointing we have to respect the man of God Amen so we salute our pastor shame amen is past three score and 10. and the Lord has been gracious to him but he is so Faithfully serving the lord still Faithfully laboring in the vineyard still has a concern for souls and the Lord has given him a vision for Stanger and I believe the Lord is Blessing the fellowship there the Lord is raising up man amen to support the ministry and they are still laboring and witnessing to people amen so we are going to pray the blessing of the Lord be upon him we are going to pray the Holy the same age of God that's moving in the church will move in Stanger and they shall have a supernatural increase this year because that blessing is not just limited to this church but it's limited to whosoever will amen let him come and drink up the Fountain of Life freely amen and I I am blessed amen because every time I talk to Pastor Shane he's always encouraging us amen he's encouraging me in the ministry and that's very rare to find other Ministries to connect with your ministry and be able to say I've been listening to what you've been preaching and don't stop amen these are the exact word don't stop keep pressing on Amen amen amen he said what you're preaching is exactly the truth amen so we appreciate our elders amen amen we appreciate amen even without our Elder here brother sunny always encouraging the ministry amen now why I say that's rare sometimes all people forgive me for using that word but all the people in the ministry they can start to develop complexes and not try to lift up the younger Ministries but these brothers are not so amen their desire is to see the younger Ministry progress and move forward with the things of God Amen amen so when you'll be able to find things like that where you recognize you don't think that we don't recognize it amen is always texting me because brother is always texting me amen and we should always appreciate that that somebody is thinking about you somebody is upholding you in prayer and somebody is trying to move you forward don't you think that's a marvelous thing amen amen let's give God praise for that amen so I tell you God is doing a new thing the work for the new year was we all are doing new things amen I'm doing a new thing 2023 is tied to the angel of the Lord and I'm telling you if you can have reach out in faith you are going to see the spirit of God move like you've never seen it amen so we started the youth meetings again I believe yesterday was the first youth meeting I encourage you that's not a private initiative of brother Jacob that's an initiative of the church amen amen he has my blessing to go forward with the youth meetings amen amen we talk we discuss things we have a vision together amen so anything that's happening don't think that you we got a vision for your family we got a vision for the young people we want them to experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so yesterday I believe he started the first youth meeting and he's got some good things he's instilling in them amen maybe he'll tell you about them sometime so encourage them to come to the youth meeting your meeting is not only for those that are in the teenage years amen if you can be a supporter brother Jethro ask him how can I help you in that department how can I support the youth now forgive me position for taking some time here this is just a talk to the church you can support the youth ministry in different ways amen you can provide a meal for the Youth it's only a handful of them you can you can say brother what can I do maybe you need some material maybe you need this you're going for an outing I'll sponsor this I'll do this whatever you can do to support the ministry it's for the benefit of the young people amen I'll do the the most simple thing send your young people to the meetings amen they will benefit from it amen because amen we will address certain things in the youth meeting that maybe we won't address in the church here amen it'll be more focused amen it'll be more direct amen I'm expecting amen even this year I will get involved in some meetings brother Joshua will get involved in some meetings amen because we have a clear vision of where we want to go Gloria you can ask us our vision and we'll tell you because when there's no vision the people perish we have a vision for the church right near the pastor I think of you personally and I have a vision for an individual amen I have a vision for your family although I may not physically can come to you all the time I am committing you and your family before the Lord all the time and change a situation amen amen and believe me when you are covered under such an anointing there's no way your family will be the same I'm expecting Brothers to raise up in the church and be a better support to the church amen to say brother I want to dedicate more of my time to this ministry remember God didn't bring you into this ministry just to occupy a Pew no amen right if you can put your shoulders to the wheel we can move forward we have a vision for outreach work we want to get that going because the support to that amen we want to see this go forward I don't understand you also amen who chats and books we are keeping these things in mind Lord is already connected me with a brother who's ready to come and do evangelism in the area amen foreign so we're going to go maybe we won't always announce it because that is not a a church ministry like what I'm saying in the settings of these four walls you might just hear that we're out here ministering without the administering we're out there doing an open end as the spirit of God leads we will move amen we've got to put the evangelists to work yes amen so we are very connected with evangelists send them out on the mission feels amen Hallelujah and you can partner with that amen you can be a part of that Ministry don't let the year go by and you never done a thing for the kingdom of God amen so amen I think we should stop there otherwise our country giving you a talk to the church amen but we are setting the stage for the year January has been a phenomenal year how many of you can testify to that we've seen more moving up the Supernatural and moving of the holy spirit in January how many of you can listen to what I am saying in January alone we've seen so much of Supernatural but I tell you that's just getting us started if we can raise up to that faith we have we are done with preaching sermons we are done with preaching sermons we are done with religious services it's time for the Holy Ghost to strike and if you can step into that Vision I tell you this church will not be the same and not only the church but we will set the body on fire amen happy if you know it always started with one group that had a vision one group that had a purpose one group that had a passion to get our little squabbles forget our little fightings forget your little thing oh I'm upset about this cat in the other who are you or Wretched Man and your feelings matter put your feelings on the Shelf love your neighbor as yourself it's the best way to have a Revival amen how many of you remember that old song the best way to have a Revival is to pray every day and read your Bible let's stand together as we see the man of God Amen Hallelujah but Shane we thank you for taking the time this morning coming to minister the word of the Lord amen Hallelujah I tell you this is a Divine appointment this

which this church is green amen amen I appreciate the uh the ministry of the pastor the ministry of brother Joshua and sometimes I think to myself about brother sunny I said this man went to the hospital he couldn't breathe and when he comes here on the portrait like he didn't even go to the hospital amen amen that's how great our God Amen when he takes an anointed gift and uses the anointed gift for the presentation to the church it's deity speaking amen you need to honor that amen amen praise the Lord so uh I'm nothing new I'm so thrilled to see that you're gone with the uh uh the youths you know just trying to get things organized and positionally praised it's very very good amen we all have to put ours our shoulders together amen and by doing that as a spiritual strength will be accumulated amen and with the spiritual strength be accumulation the rapturing freight will be installed and the power of God will just move amen praise the Lord I bring you greetings amen spoken word fellas who said that we serve the same God Amen we believe the same message yes we have to say the Revelation amen we don't go by any other thing amen yes it does anything that's we need you know it's in the word it's in a message and what the prophet has brought to us so I'm I I am really blessed to know and understand that your for my pastor he did all he could do amen present this church to you yeah amen that you could be seated here and listen to the word of the Lord change your mindset to be a son and a daughter amen this morning I want to minister to you on a subject and I trust that the Lord will richly bless you amen and I want to speak about I am predestinated to hear my theophany called hallelujah amen amen I am predestinated to hear my amen hallelujah amen so we will turn to the scripture this morning found in the Bible in the Book of John amen chapter 16 verses 13. you understand amen okay John chapter 16 verses 30. how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come amen when was The Book of John written and watch the prison and is is a present tense amen amen he speaks of one thing yes not of yesterday amen but of today what is happening and it's in the present tense amen he's still calling as many as the Lord that God shall call amen amen praise the Lord he will guide you into our truth amen hallelujah he will guide you into your truth and the word of the Lord says for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever ye shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come amen so remember that made the Lord is Blessing to the reading of his word you may take the company hallelujah amen I like this one here is that you shall speak and he shall show you things to come amen and whatsoever he shall hear yes amen Seven Angels Came yes in the constellation pitch up the prophet of Malachi Pro he reckoned that was a very notable injury yes amen he said it's the seventh and we realized by Revelation and deep understanding and the progression of the Holy Ghost instilled in us there is a spiritual awakening there is a spiritual call and whatever that was out there there was a purpose God had to reveal that purpose to the end time message amen so that we know that the entire message this message of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 7 will do two things amen right he will turn your hearts amen yes one number two it will be the revelation that's contained in the Seven Seals amen it will be this divinely revered mystery truth amen and return your hearts amen God we are here our hearts have been changed no across the same but the ministry that goes from the out desk of God Amen to you amen I am predestinated to hear myself amen wonderful amen in your message entitled a guide preached on the 14th of January 1962. Amen in that message when the spirit of Truth is come amen he will guide you into our trip hallelujah what is truth the truth is the word amen so you have had Divine guidance in bringing yourself to a church and mystical body and this mystical body enhances the word of the Lord in spiritual discernment for you to be a partaker to be a son and a daughter of Almighty Amen in the mystical body so you are in a mystical body you are not here by accident yes your call was different your searching was different your mindset was different you couldn't understand yourself the only way you could understand yourself is by understanding God and God understand me because I'm further now watch I'm showing you certain things when it says when the Holy Ghost is come right he's come the Holy Ghost is come why did the proper bring these things for our admonition we need to learn amen we need to understand we need to search we need to it is the Bible we need to pray we need to ask God for revelation let's go marriage and divorce but now that the seals are open the spirit of Truth directs us to the world so now what is he trying to tell us here now there is something about the shields there is something about the seals yes there's something about you you are sealed in the seventh seal message amen amen you cannot come out of it yes the devil cannot take you out again amen you were prejestinated you are hearing the tearful recall amen is ancient but the amen that you are producing within yourself amen because that predestinated call that the Japanese is not something to be taken lightly it is a call of God Amen right that explains why all the mistakes has been down Through the Ages because the seals was not over yeah amen amen so you said no no no my father told me that church but sister said no no don't go to this I will go to that church and carry on and you are moving on joining this church joining that church right you're going to be careful of all this amen amen why did God be destinated you you know something you are very very special yes the Lord Jesus Christ amen you cannot understand yourself yes but the only way that you could understand yourself to get the Holy Ghost amen to get the Holy Ghost when he the Holy Ghost is come it will teach you he will tell you he will direct you in all manner of whatever the Bible tells you and what it will produce in your life your life speaks volumes can you say amen amen amen it speaks volumes your mind let us just look at some things that what changes the attitude of Our Lives in uh the word of the Lord unless we suffer with him he cannot reign with him amen nobody is a deceited here can say that you are not suffering yes you are suffering for the purpose amen you are suffering for some objective and meaningful time frame in life to get you out of a situation and that's only Jesus Christ can do that for you Okay the reason for this is a character simply is never me without suffering sometimes you say I don't know why my husband I don't know why my wife I don't know why my children I don't know this I don't know that you know why no Jesus you will know all things Canada is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power good character is Victor who amen that is one of the idea amen the character with power expect to do amen tell us what we need to do what was under Sunday's no one knows see 24 of the church is good but we need to know so what we tell you it will take the Revelation given by the prophet under the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost to enhance a characteristic of theophoric living we deep inside of you to surpass the natural aspect in your life with regards to the word of the Lord amen amen come on our church yes praise the Lord amen hallelujah the church has always counted membership God counts characters not members Hallelujah for you young says you are in the right track for you that are here you are in the right track you cannot go off the track yes a train cannot go after church unless it's delayed something goes wrong something is sabotaged this message can never be sabotaged amen amen this is word oriented amen it is spiritual obligation of a Divine leg Holy Ghost life to manifest the characteristics of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord Hallelujah what you read what you do most your character I'm talking about the Holy Ghost okay we come here now gentlemen begin to the hands of the Lord amen we want to connect with us outside I'm going to collect myself amen you want to correct yourself you're never supercharge I am a super church but if you should not divinely let under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost we will see our time amen amen so therefore I say you this morning we are sprinkled and worth it amen thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah your Works were through what your character is yes amen your character is known by The Works that you do amen because you say amen amen okay let's go it's page 157 of the church age book brother brother makes a profound statement and that statement give me this he has ministered the church age of July of 63 I am going to read amen if you are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost if you are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost listen very carefully now you and the steam his word above your necessary meat amen now right now that's why we are here why we've got the Holy Ghost because the holy country yet in the word of God if he went he had the word of God let's see what he says further he says yeah and yet to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God Amen every word every word that's what Jesus said and then we are living by every word that the prophet has brought to us hallelujah let there be a joy abundance Amen Let There be something that is there that will hear Mark and know that you are the child you are a son and you're a daughter and this is what he says this is my Earnest prayer for us today maybe again you live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God Amen why did he bring that in the church Jesus he knew that this message of malachite foreign [Music] [Music] a dark is a word expressed and the word expressed living in you will be the result of what you do in your everyday life [Music] he says in this wonderful message of time tested Memorial of God we had better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before God Amen Hallelujah no identity amen some people are looking there for you to come and take you to church and you had somebody tell them that I'm not here so what can you do you just go by with it and you just thank the Lord and appreciate the Lord amen praise the Lord so then what will we take with us so then what will they take with us we will take our character Hallelujah right hey yeah right that is what we will take with another man of the church is the character of the people amen when God's
