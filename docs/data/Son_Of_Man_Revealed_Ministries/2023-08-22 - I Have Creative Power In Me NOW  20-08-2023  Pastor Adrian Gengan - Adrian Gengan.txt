exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think and we ought to come with grateful Hearts amen hallelujah after the cross we ought to come daily before the throne of grace and thanking him amen hallelujah bless the Lord amen so let's turn to Genesis Chapter 18 amen for a title I want to speak on we're still dealing with Abraham's Journey of Faith but I want to bring it to this I have creative power the PowerPoint is open amen hallelujah I have creative power in me now amen not tomorrow yes I'm not waiting for it I have creative power in me now amen amen did he say the word is in the bride yes amen hallelujah as it was in Mary so let's turn to Genesis 18. we're only going to be dealing with the first 15 verses because we're only dealing with Abraham and Sarah's portion the next portion goes down to Sodom or the negotiation amen the intercessory role that Abraham is playing there but we're not focusing with on that this morning because Genesis 18 is packed amen and you know how the prophet will take Luke 17 30 and you're tying all of the scriptures amen so we don't we don't want to focus too much on that we want to focus on this first part of Genesis 18 from 1 to 15. amen and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tenth Door In the Heat of the day so he's sitting outside the tent he's sitting by the tent door amen who's in the tent Sarah is in the tent Amen to the prophet have attained vision amen hallelujah and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and low three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord amen so the mystery of God is already revealed to him amen he had met Melchizedek yes so that was Melchizedek in theophany so he had soy it come from Spirit to word to flesh now amen so remember these are all types and shadows of our Lord Jesus Christ amen my Lord if now I have found favor in thy side pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree so very quickly melchized gave him Bread and Wine and now he was doing food washing amen so communion and foot washing is restored back to the church amen and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort he your hearts after that you pass on for therefore for you come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said and Abram Abraham acen into the tent unto Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal need it and make cakes upon the Earth that's like an oven right and Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he haste to dress it amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so that's typing the sacrifice that's to come there's a lamb so God is establishing our Lord is now he's the meal offering if you're noticing now is the drink offering being poured out he's got water he's got Jesus say I'm the bread of life he's the bread in this chapter is he the water Living Waters there's water in the chapter amen is there a lamb yeah amen hallelujah praise the Lord and young men shall arise amen and sweep this message to the coming of the Lord these men sitting on the stage that's what the prophet is saying now if they can take this message they'll make more sense to it is Abraham giving the cup to a young man amen amen amen gave it unto a young man and he asked her to dress it and he took butter and milk and the cough which he had risked and said it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat amen praise the Lord and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife so notice the message is Progressive now amen God never stopped them anyway let me just read so you I can get you seated right where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it seized to be with Sarah after the man of woman therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am wax old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also so this is not spoken now this is in a heart she's mocking and and saying these things now the Lord says is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed we spoke on time and season last week I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou did love amen so the Lord will have the final say that amen then let's go to Hebrews 11 11. Hallelujah Hebrews 11 11. you're the Apostle Paul is getting some insight into Sarah with the 11th Hour workers so in the 11th chapter of faith in the 11th verse he talks about the woman conceiving is that us yes amen hallelujah through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed amen amen so that strength is coming from a world that word that word strength means power she received power to conceive Amen to the word is giving you that now through faith also Sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised amen amen and one more verse of scripture in Proverbs 18 20 . amen sorry 1821 1821 death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof amen death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit they off amen you may be seated the Lord and blessings to the reading of his word amen praise the Lord amen I said praise the Lord now in 22 they very quickly it says whoso finded a wife find it a good thing and obtained favor of the Lord so look at your wife and say hello good thing amen the Bible calls you a good thing what is a thing a thing is a word amen I don't know if you believe anything is a word amen hallelujah didn't uh the bible say that Within Mary was found the holy thing come on our church you need to be spiritually the Holy Ghost created in Mary a holy thing amen so thing is a word when you tell somebody I want to tell you something amen amen what are you telling them I'm telling you something I'm talking to your body word amen hallelujah so you think is a what Hallelujah so the holy thing the word became flesh was in Mary now before we go there amen I also want to give thanks to the Lord because 11 years of marriage amen amen and I thank the Lord for my wife amen hallelujah and the Lord has given me a good wife a blessing to me and the ministry amen amen so I love my wife very much and I want you to know that amen and if you get on a good day she'll also tell you that I'm the best thing that happened to her but you have to get on a good day and now if you believe today is a good day amen amen amen God bless our visitors amen sister Janita husband amen I don't know your name brother what's your name okay brother amen let's give them a hand amen if you come early I would have made you sin because the last thing I told you you help me get him to make you sing amen and is that your mother-in-law or is it your family okay God bless you Sister amen and all the children amen praise the Lord amen so remember our topic now is creative power is in who creative power is in you even now amen the power to create is within you amen but you've got to believe it because all things of God must be received of Faith amen so what are we learning in Genesis 18 now in the first 15 verses there is a final sign and a final message amen all these years God had been training Abraham and bringing him up to a point he was getting rid of all the doubt and all of the unbelief amen but they come one at evening time amen amen they came one at evening time with the final message amen amen and only the predestinator of God can understand and receive the message of the hour amen so you'll find even there in the way the verse starts out he says the Lord appeared unto him in the planes of memory the memory is a place called strength amen it's a place of strength and power amen so Abraham is living even though he has not physically changed he is living in the land of strength amen amen it's where all trees are growing and he's sitting by this whole tree amen and I thank God that we have some oak trees in the message of the hour men who are unmoved amen hallelujah despite them not seeing the promise in their day they stood firm like an oak tree and they preach the message of the hour Amen in the face of criticism they preach the message of the hour amen hallelujah praise the Lord now they come to the tent door now it must have been a good day Abraham must have woken up this day and said there's never been a day like this day to me never been a day like this day I've seen never been a light that shines so bright like this day this glorious day amen hallelujah now you get what you expect and Abraham was sitting there on the expectation amen waiting for the coming of the Lord amen and we are waiting right now waiting to receive the promised son amen hallelujah so he sees these three men coming to the tento amen and he runs to them and he bows himself in worship and he says my Lord if now I found favor in your sight and we know that Abraham had already found favor in the sight of the Lord amen same like you you are sitting here in the message of the hour because you found favor in the sight of the Lord you are not your chance you are not here through marriage amen you are here to the predestinated plan of almighty God God had chosen you to come into the message of the hour amen maybe you feel like God has forgotten about you because here time had passed since the Lord called Abraham amen 25 years had passed but God has not forgotten about you amen amen you will be a bury that Dream Within you you are made bury the promise within you but God has not forgotten about you amen is bringing a word to bring to pass the promise in your life so the final message is given to Abraham is the promise that Sarah not AGA yes that Sarah will produce the cell from our own womb we have just been through the previous chapter where they tried to do God a service without it being his will she gave agar unto Abraham and she said producer son through him amen but there was not God's provided way he says Sarah you shall have amen hallelujah I want you amen whether you're young or old I want you to know you shall produce the Life of Christ amen your mother will produce the Life of Christ yes but the Lord wants you to produce the Life of Christ amen you can't depend on your father producing The Life of Christ you can't depend on your mother producing The Life of Christ amen every one of us has got to produce the Life of Christ amen say Amen somebody amen some of us need to become pregnant amen some of us need to get pregnated with the word amen amen hallelujah some of us may have aborted the word but it's time to get re-impregnated amen it's time to take the word within us yes amen hallelujah so the final message is that Sarah shall conceive that's the final message that comes in Genesis 18. you will produce the Life of Christ yes that's what the message of the hour came to do to bring us up into that statue of the perfect man to meet The Headstone come in and what was the final sign so there's a final message and a final sign the final sign is the back turned I don't want to turn because you're going to see my bald spot the final sign is the back turn and he's deserting Sarah's heart yes didn't brother Branham do that yes what was that a son of man was revealing the son of man showing us the same scene is reproduced again amen and all his life from 1933 he was waiting for a message amen doubt it at the Ohio River your message your foreign the second coming amen amen so all his life he waited for a message and the message came in 1963 yeah amen hallelujah I need you to drive all unbelief out the message came in 1963 when seven angels descended in a cloud yes yes this is not a cloud formed by rocket fuel neither is this a rain cloud this is a cloud amen that's formed by seven angels amen hallelujah a cloud formed by seven angels He says the Angels themselves formed his weak amen so you find if you read from verse 16 onwards you'll see the judge of all the Earth and that's what he's coming he's coming to give a final message to us brothers and sisters but he's also coming to judge Solomon Gomorrah [Music] amen and the fire is ready to fall upon them amen hallelujah so we just went through that scripture and we showed you how all the elements that we have spoken about the bread the water amen the young lamb everything is typing Christ that's coming amen and this was a man who left his own poor but God promises he's going to bless him amen now he's living in his inheritance he's living in His blessings and he can offer back to the Lord everything that the Lord had given him praise the Lord somebody amen we are living now in the time when the fullness of the world is open and we can be a string to one another we can be a strength amen the Lord can take comfort in US amen amen hallelujah the Lord healed Peter's mother-in-law and then she ministered unto him you have a Ministry you have a walk to do amen Hallelujah your part is to take the world and receive the word praise the Lord amen amen amen hallelujah so let's let's go on now amen now we're talking about creative power in you but we've been lied to in this world since we were born we've been taught to trust our five senses and what we see amen amen amen do you believe brother Tyler is sitting next to you do you afraid to believe that look at him do you need Faith to believe that because you can see him amen hallelujah but if I truly the angel of the Lord is sitting right there right now amen you'll need Faith to believe that amen amen Faith looks to the Unseen amen amen amen so we are not to look at our situations our problem with the cni amen amen amen we must deny these senses whether we see it or not whatever you trust in the Lord for whether you see it or not whether you feel it or not you believe the Lord his word has created Power to bring it to pass in your life amen amen now when God created this man in Genesis 1 27 he had just finished creating and he spoke by the spoken word now he says I'm going to create a man like me who can speak the word that's how we will ought to be that should be taught in every syllabus yes that should be taught in every school this is where we fell from amen man is powerful yeah yeah man is an amateur God amen after God said let him have dominion over the Earth God never took that Dominion back come on now God will not walk contrary to his word God said that as a law and God is bringing back sons and daughters on the earth even now to take dominion over all things amen the problem is we need to get all unbelief out of us we need to get negative thinking out of us amen we need to believe the word of God so much so amen that is thus saith the Lord I don't know why we are waiting for Dusty and the Lord and the word of God is that said the Lord amen there's a quote here where the prophet of God is saying I was somebody told me to pray for the sister she was sick and I went there and I began to pray and I said Lord show me a vision and he said the Lord came and condemned him and he says why do you need a vision because vision is secondary a gift given to a property secondary it doesn't over amen power the word of God heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away the prophet says I woke up from there and I applied the scripture yes hallelujah amen people are living defeated lives now because they can't see the prophet of God around but he came to restore back the word of God believe back in the word of God that these signs shall follow them that believe if we lay hands upon the sick they shall recover amen now the devil desired desire to be like the Genesis 1 27 person yes because he doesn't have the power to create but this man was a God man walking in Eden yes and yeah the prophet said that the devil cannot create but he perverts what God has already created and that's what he did to many perverted their thinking right you know in Isaiah 14 he tells you amen how he says I will Ascend you to heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will also sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the eyes of the clouds I will be like the most high the desire that Satan had God gave it to you for you to be like the most high amen church is another time to play around Sons and Daughters must come to their position Sons and Daughters might come to their full inheritance amen we've been living under our privileges for far too long amen hallelujah the prophet of God says that science has taken man more in the relative up in the Realms of science than the church has taken them in the world amen Hallelujah the church world is only focused around monetary value yeah amen about a car or a house or a few hundred dollars amen that's all they keep them there yeah but we have gone past them amen amen we are going back Amen to Genesis 1 27 amen we are going all the way back to the original creation amen amen amen I know not everybody will receive that because that's not our expectation amen so the prophet of God says he is calling his church giving her that final last call that final last sign that she would receive he says there's about to be a new world born and a new church born to go to it for the Millennium a final sign a final message a final sign is to get in the conditions like she was where you never do you see what the message come to do the property is saying to get into the condition like she was at the beginning amen we call those things that are not as though they are amen hallelujah so yeah he's saying he the spirit overshadowed the Virgin Mary and she brought forth the Sun by a creature of power yes Luke 1 35 the angel of the Lord answered and said the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God so the power the creator of power came into the home of Mary now this might shock some people's theology but he created both the egg and the sperm yeah yes amen amen it wasn't any human part yes Hallelujah now while we're talking about that somebody else your neighbor can't produce the Life of Christ for you you can't have a surrogate by them you can't have a surrogate experience you yourself have got to be impregnated and you yourself have got to bring forth the Life of Christ amen that's why Peter says I don't want you to be better not unfruitful amen amen hallelujah let's move along brother oh we're going to go to some good stuff now the other Prophet is talking about a person who had leukemia in the blood so leukemias can't say the blood all my doctors Google friends here Dr Googles leukemia is cancer in the blood amen so he says when he prayed for her it wasn't one trace of leukemia found in the child now he says that's instantaneously on the map the power of almighty God take the bloodstream and cleanse it out the child got new blood come on now the blood was cancerous but the child got new blood creative power I'm not talking about buying the stuff here I'm talking about creative power that's laying within you amen thank you he says put a pulsation of new life back in there your bloodstream is your life and create new cells and clean out the old what is it the creative act of almighty God to take a bloodstream that's contaminated with cancer and within just a few moments time a brand new blood stream maybe there's something wrong with your plan maybe they'll shoot too much sugar glucose level in your blood God can bring it back to normal even now in an instant maybe your right your blood pressure is too high God can change that right now but if you can't believe all things are possible thank you Lord praise the Lord I have two brothers this week just randomly talk to me about the creature of power [Music] randomly talk to me you know who you are sitting here talk to me about speaking one brother is expecting new bones all things are possible yes we'll show you now it's possible yes thank you amen I'll shock you with some things now that even it'll bother your own mind amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord here's my inspiration now I believe the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored amen amen thank you Lord amen thank you did he set the behind I believe the hour is approaching amen now that was some time ago right yes you think it's here yes amen I believe it's here yes the always approach even missing limbs will be restored yes and the glorious power of the Creator I believe if you can make squirrel up here here is a mad woman just got a pot missing Hallelujah don't need to create an entire squirrel just one patch yes that's a complete animal in itself he is God I love him and this is now coming in the seals this is the first seal he's preaching this the mysteries in the seals amen amen hallelujah amen he says now he's talking about the fish I wouldn't almost spoke to the fish if something Adam told me to speak first right he spoke those secondarily see what are you saying now the word is primary yes him speaking as a prophet he's saying that was secondary through the Holy Spirit through human lips become creative power of the almighty if you get anything from the service get this you don't need a prophet now the word has been restored back to us but I'm saying the word I'm talking about your Bible fall in love with your Bible take the promises of God take the word of God Amen hear what he's saying now follow the thought he's saying secondarily through the Holy Spirit he used human lips and creative Powers full to the fish right he says your death taken place that way how much more could he take through the written word of the Lord God that was full through human lips as it was through see then he quotes the scripture if that can't believe how simple yeah you go back to God and say Lord you said yes amen if thou can't believe all things are possible you told me if I have faith and I believe my own word I can speak to this mountain and he must move yes yes thank you believe it friend of mine amen hallelujah praise the Lord you see if you're a Son of God you're like God men somebody needs to confess us say I am like God message he just speaks the word and it creates itself his words the creator of power how the world come here he made it out of things which was not he said let there be and yeah it is he believed his own word amen we speak and we don't believe what we are saying amen we need to change ourselves change our thinking change the way if we've been found in a certain way maybe doubtful maybe amen we haven't been believing hard let's change our ways stay with the word yes until you see the Promise come to pass amen hallelujah and this dirt that you're sitting over here tonight is the creative power of almighty God the creative world the dirt is the word of God made manifest I'm here tonight because the word of God was manifest oh don't they just give the devil a black eye it's a good thing the devil is the spirits we can run otherwise we'll open the door so we can hey we don't want him trapped here now okay God's driving all unbelief away from you amen amen God is driving all unbelief away from you amen yeah he says so here he stands a mighty conqueror after he rose again now the veil is in true remember the the veil is in two now and he cut every obstacle from human beings so any obstacle for you to go back to the Garden of Eden condition he cut it off you restored your back that day might be connected like in the garden of I was going to choke you but I'm going to see it man is omnipotent come on now what is omnipotent it's of a deity having unlimited power amen right you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent and if you desire to be this man yes then we need to surrender to the Lord is approaching now and missing limbs will appear I believe it yes amen amen yes did not he say Mark 11 22 23 right whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it shall come to pass you can have what you said have we been dealing with this through the months coming but a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent yes I come to church when I feel like a man fully surrendered I don't understand why people want to live powerless lives a powerless life is one without the Holy Ghost and you can't tell me you got the Holy Ghost and you don't come to church I am so full of the Holy Ghost I just love to stay at home I love to watch my movies your version of the Holy Ghost loves to watch Netflix your version of the Holy Ghost loves to watch movies and fellowship with the neighbor some of you if you're so ungodly because you got negative influence your friends you love your unbelieving friends you love to sit and talk stories with them yeah yeah instead of you influencing them they have influenced you right so you've become so backslidden even you don't know it like even now you're hearing my voice and you're thinking he's not talking about me it can't be me oh yeah but the spirit of God descends all the hearts here right now yes he knows who's playing Church all of us can put a nice suit and a Time come here yes amen come and show the part look the part but a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent let me tell you something if you're not fully surrendered to God you're not going in the Rapture you want to spend all your time all your life wasting it when and you you like trying to sneak into places of the world you might as well go and enjoy yourself in the world because you're not going to make it anyhow living that kind of a life God's not going to give participation Awards yes yes you know it's good these days even if the child come last they give them participation award I don't want to hurt their feeling we need to build up the morale God's not like this God says I cast you into all the darkness but I gave you my word I gave you the opportunity I gave you the opportunity and this is how you treated me people run to God and they treat God like a hearing boy when they want something yeah but a man needs to be fully surrendered God is omnipotent is his word also forsake not the assembly together of yourselves is that also the written word yes amen praise the Lord let's move on I've got so much amen he says when Sunni now this is where the way I'm getting to some people have not confessed their sin so that's why they can't get back to their condition but he says When sin is broke up when sin is confessed upon the basis of the blood of Jesus Christ it's like dropping a drop of Black Ink in a batch of Clorox it breaks into all the chemicals and send it back to where it comes from that's the way the blood of Jesus Christ does now it's very important why I'm bringing this here I don't I didn't put up the quote on the slide but yes to there's twins girls right come to this Prophet is relating this now they get some sickness and they find some stuff in their blood and these are pure girls young girls virgin girls and they have venereal disease they've got when they did all the tears they are shocked because his girls are Pure Clean living girls and they do the test and they find that these girls have venereal disease the prophet says now because he's a prophet he can see it he says it wasn't them it was their grandfather he says the sins of the church has come out to the third generation ah maybe you've been struggling with something and that thing is not under the blood because only things that are under the blood that curse will be forgiven amen I want to break every chain and every cup from your grandparents your great-grandparents that may be coming upon your life that Spirit of poverty may be because of your great great grandparents but you need to bring that under the blood and you need to say Lord sin who is broke up you're at the cross whatever they did Lord I'm putting it under the blood I'm receiving my healing amen these things shall not touch my children all my children children right here now I'm bringing it under the blood amen sometimes you wonder why you struggle with things amen don't you go to the doctor and they ask you did your father have cancer did your father have high blood pressure did your father have heart disease tell him listen here no my father did not have [Music] he was my heart patient sorry there's My Father Here Jesus Christ king of kings and Lord of lords he has no history about problem I am no longer the son of Charles and Ella Branham you see the doctors he's trying to pass that on to you so when you're going to the the doctor's room and they say do you have history of Cancer and a history of heart disease in your family don't ever say yes Satan is waiting to jump through your confession that's right say no I've never had a history of it yes you know what you're talking about God is your father God is your Source God is your strength yes Lord thank you thank you amen so he says when that is confessed now it puts man across the chasm again puts him back in his original position as a Son of God the creative power of God is in him amen yes he says under the blood of bulls and goats when he meant to pull out fire and the word of the Lord came to him he created things by the word now if you don't do that under the blood of bulls yeah what about the blood of Jesus you stand in the presence of God now a redeemed son the church is far below with standard of living and I think too many times we're progging instead of really coming out and facing the issue let's not be that way amen slowly moving along amen Hallelujah he says when you become a prisoner surrounded in Christ Christ is in you his life bringing forth his evidence he signs bringing his signs as of life as he evident of his resurrection proving to the world that eternal life vindicates to the world that we are alive in him and I think of it alive with God Our Redeemer who created us for the very same purpose the church and his creative life in US men let's look at our Lord Jesus Christ now Matthew 12 10. here's a man who doesn't have a hand you want Bible I'll give you Bible the man's hand is withered hello yes yes and Jesus tells him stretch what thy hand and as he stretches forth his hand he's at his restore hole instantaneously like as the other amen you know any manufacturer carries spare parts [Music] amen yes Hallelujah come on now any manufacturer carries spare parts amen now some people like to save money and they fix the old broken part no matter how many times you break down they'll go and fix something they'll fix it they they keep taking it to a mechanic but there's some they don't have time for them yes yes they go straight to the manufacturer you can go to the Ramesh and go to brother uh and you can get a part just like the original original I see some of you don't want to believe this this is a great power this is Jesus is showing us how Adam operated was he the last Adam yes yeah so he came to show us how Adam operated yeah so the man doesn't even have a hand Jesus says to him stretch for thine hand amen and he stretched it forward there's a part for him to do now he stretches it forth and it was restored whole like as the other there was a young girl she had cancer in her ovaries and I don't know all these terms I was just reading it something about a fallopian tube you probably your sisters don't know what that is there to remove that with the one over it right to get rid of the cancer so the surgery went through they removed everything it was successful now like with any surgery they give it time to pass to see if there is a Resurgence of the cancer right but these people this mother and father started to pray back the word of God that by the stripes of Jesus she's healed amen and they started to speak the word back that this child is just a young child and they desire to see you have children so some time passes that you have to go back for a checkup and they kept confessing the word of God kept confessing the word of God sometime past they go back and they tell them sorry the cancer has spread to the other and we need to remove that as well these parents refused to believe that report of the doctor so they go back and they start to pray and believe the word of God and confess that over the doctor and they said the doctor finally told him you have to make a decision now we have to operate otherwise this cancer is going to spread they started to pray and they said when the doctor operates this cancer must just pop off and that fallopian tube and that ovary must not be touched right when the doctors are performing their thing like they spoke it this thing pops off amen it pops off right so the operation is successful obviously the parents are not in the operating room so they go back the doctor comes to give a report and he tells him we don't know what happened but the cancer just popped off amen and he says upon doing our scans we can see two ovaries and two fallopian troops amen so the doctor is puzzled he the same Doctor Who is telling them that there's a new one there amen amen hallelujah [Music] you see we've not believed been believing at that level we've been been believing for repairs some of us have had a service plan what do we need participation a maintenance plan where they replace parts now you can quote back the word Lord you did it in Matthew 12. yes you gave the man a new hand amen so the sun you know where I'm going with this the Lord can give you a new alarm the Lord can give you a new heart I believe he's already done it yes amen that's right you know what you need brother Ramesh we already spoke about it yes says he can feel it being formed daily amen brand new parts and he's a man who can live out of experience because he deals with pots effective you return it back yes the manufacturer has got to replace it who created us amen who's our manufacturer amen amen now there's a captain Al Farah he's one of the FB he's the fbis of juvenile juveniles right so they had a little boy and they sent him into the meeting and he had no hip bone you're saying brother you got so much yes he had no hip bone and when the little fellow was brought in laying on the court the Holy Spirit told him who he was and what happened his little faith and asked him to rise from the court he's got no hip bone hello what do you think is going to happen and the little boy obeyed and jumped his mother said he can't he's got no hip gone and he jumped Plum out of his mother's arms and ran down the screen Street screaming to the top of his voice his mother fell in the court and the boy was laying in and they took him down to the doctor to have an x-ray Captain alfara and the doctor said he has a perfect hip bone [Applause] beneath our privileges thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord amen now we come into the latter parts of of the message of the hour and here is it Christ's mystery he says this is God's great mystery of Love expressed that God and man became one what is it being filled with his Spirit him having the preeminences I've been saying this for a while some of us think the holy spirit is too demanding he wants too much of my time so I don't want the Holy Spirit I just want to come to church I just want to hear a good sermon but he wants to have the preeminances that was God's achievement that God's purpose to do that that he might be in Christ and Christ in us and all of us together the same the Holy Spirit same thing it revealed it to Christ revealed it to you the supernatural creative power you may be saying how you're going to receive it if you've got the Holy Ghost in you and you're receiving the word creative power is laying within you amen you've got to mix your faith with the world don't let the word lay dormant there Rise Up in faith amen amen and don't live for momentary times of when you're in desperation begin to live in a world of perfect Faith amen amen begin to live in a world of perfect faith praise the Lord amen it's God in man that's his manifestation that's what he's revealing that's what he's trying to do God's Own word revealing it show that man cannot create God is the creator it ain't man no more it's God the Creator in man which is in his church in 63. creative power is in you now the Lord is for the brown is praying and he's praying to the Lord and he's saying Jesus of Nazareth send forth thy Spirit tonight thy creating spirit and thy great presence to drive back the darkness of the enemy and may all the people have a creative power in their heart tonight the power of Faith all Creator Grant this to us how many of you want to pray that prayer amen send your queen to Spirit Lord amen hallelujah we're not playing with the devil this year yes if you've got a problem with your stomach you got a problem with your gut you can either have it repaired or replaced what do you want I'm talking about hip replacement without surgery you say who's going to perform it did not the bible say that the angels are ministering Spirits they can perform operations without you even knowing it while you're sitting there now operations are going on if you can't believe amen yeah thank you yes thank you the baron shall bear child all blocked arteries shall be cleared in Jesus name all sugar levels back to normal amen all blood eye blood pressure back to normal all low blood pressure back to normal yes amen but you've got to put in the claim yeah amen it says now I prayed the message you gave me up in the woods a few days ago on that creative power which sets in the church this morning imagine resisting the church and the people didn't know it but that's why he sent us a prophet amen the very people it was created on oh Jesus thou Son of God come again anoint your church freely fully powerfully May the spirit of the living resurrected Jesus resurrect this little church this morning into a new Faith amen power yes power of faith that we might put every gains here to shame Grant you Lord amen somebody receive it amen amen amen amen amen the body is the flesh that you look at that must rot it was born by sexual desire with your father and mother it must brought it's no good therefore in the new birth in the resurrection when you're brought forth again in a new body it will be God's creative power that will speak like he did to Adam and you will come forth amen your new body will come forth through God's creative power amen yeah he says lord they're seeking more life after hearing that the blood of Jesus so thoroughly cleanses that there's no more nothing that the complete word of God rests within them is it resting within us that the very command of the pastor's voice is creative power that the very command of the Evangelist voice is creative power very creative the very command of there own voice is creative power because in them is Holy Ghost and this Holy Ghost is a he makes things come to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes God in action amen the word thought I'm having good thoughts the word if God had remained back Before Time with Just Thoughts in his head and never spoke nothing would have happened the Bible said the prophet teaches I said he was living alone with his thoughts he had all of these thoughts in his head but one day he looked and he said let there be amen light you've been thinking about your situation for too long you've been pondering about it Mary Ponder these things in our heart but then she had to speak Let It Be unto me according to Thy Word [Music] we have testimonies of people speaking to the fridge that wasn't working people speaking to their car engine people speaking to their odometer people speaking to a natural situation people speaking to salty water and it comes back normal dead baby raised back to life amen come on now amen yes dead baby raised back to life people with AIDS HIV positive completely healed without any treatment amen amen amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord thank you the Holy Ghost is a Creator it makes things come to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes God in action oh yes so when the word leaves your mouth he says when a man confesses his sins and gets right with God God drops the sin of his of this confession into the blood of his own blood forgives that sin and replaces in that man the original spirit that should be there his own Spirit making him a Son of God how much more ought the creative power of God be in the church that some of you maybe sooner are finding out to believe that God say he will give you a new heart did he say I'll give you a news Spirit I'm sure for us to ask him amen he said a new heart will I give you a new spirit will I give you amen the prophet is confirming when the sin is confessed God puts the original spirit that should have been in man and creative power of God ought to be in the church he says when you pray believe you receive what you have asked for you shall have it see after receiving the spirit of God now God made the world out of nothing it's just his word he just created his word is creation spoke it and the word world was created because it was the object of God's mind in his heart he spoke it came into existence then if we have Zoe light God's life in us if we become sons of God and amateur creators see then he goes back to the scripture whatsoever you say believe you shall have now here's something the prophet also mentions he says I notice a lot of time I'd say things I couldn't hardly think myself but I'd say it anyhow so don't speak up as of words he says and I come to find out it did happen just that way so when you speak words into your children and say you're good for nothing you'll amount to Nothing in life you are speaking over them he says a lot of time I couldn't couldn't hardly think myself but I'd say it anyhow and I come to find out it did happen just that way I'd say things I didn't hardly mean for it to happen that way but it did anyhow because I said it I thought wait a minute so I said you see when we speak anything if something is anchored to us we shouldn't shouldn't never speak it till we believe it then when we believe it we speak it and that creative word goes out it's part of God and it creates amen some of us need to cancel words that we have spoken because we've spoken words like nothing good ever happens to me so the high priest takes your confession the prayer is going up what can I do for my son he says nothing good ever happens to him okay we'll send the word back to him according to his confession he will have it so your confession is nothing good ever happens to me your confession is nobody loves me your confession is I'm poor because my father was poor but you need to be adopted son you're struggling with something even it's a literal thing a physical thing and you're struggling with it you say I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength amen his strength is perfect in my weakness amen your child is acting up maybe they are Restless they're not behaving say I thank you Lord Jesus that my child is the holy spirit amen I thank you Lord you have the mind of Christ amen I thank you Lord they are created in your image and after your likeness yes confess the word over them amen and you watch this if you really believe that in an instant you'll see the change a whole other atmosphere comes over that child what great spirit is there than the Holy Spirit instead of going to see a psychologist you can ask the great physician together yes they tell you in school your child is not behaving you speak and I say thank you Lord that my child is behaving amen they say it's not concentrating say I thank you Lord that he has the best concentration and you maintain the confession so he says we should never speak anything so we believe it amen Hallelujah praise the Lord amen yeah this is what I wanted to get to because sometimes you speak Idle Words he says in the beginning was the word and the word spoken was creative word and every word spoken cannot be taken back for a mistake so what you've got to do remember we spoke on Esther they couldn't change amens writing I mean if you remember the message let it be written they couldn't change Esther's I mean eamonn's law so the king told Esther write a new law Amen to counter the law already written so I had negative words that have gone out of your mouth send forth a fresh word cancel those words amen can't be taken back right and now the word of God written in the Bible in his word to us and every promise has the same power of creation behind it if I were you I'd go and look for every promise and now Google has it much easier could search there for 100 Promises of God or maybe promises on healing if that's what you trust in the Lord for promises on whatever it is people have made it much easier you can find scriptures just on that every promise has the same power of creation behind it that God's word did at the beginning what he said the promise is written in this Bible if it is believed by faith and you apply it by faith it has the same creative power like at the beginning it must come forth if we believe it to be the word of God depends where the seed is falling now the word is a seed depends where it's falling right now amen see if it falls into good ground it can create it needs moisture nourishment around the promise of God will bring forth every promise the Bible need the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you look at it and take the word of just right if because the infinite God spoke it heavens and earth will pass away but my words will never pass amen we've got to move quickly now so he says you got a resting place which is the word of God you must believe it accept it and don't take it back hold on to it lay hold of it and say this is it God said it that settles it if God said so that's finished no matter how long 25 years no problem I'm holding on to the promise amen God's word said it I believe it that settles it amen Hallelujah so he says there not one molecule may have happened but when he said let there be but he's Eternal and after a while molecules begin to come in atoms right you're getting the point amen Hallelujah let's go to slide 32 there he says if you ask the father anything in my name I'll do it now that's just straight right down off the shoulder I will do it now it's on conditions if you believe when you ask me see what the condition is You Must Believe right we find out that Jesus said if you say to this mountain be plucked up don't doubt but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have it now the thing you just couldn't get out here and say mountain move down you've got to have a motive an objective be to that what's our motive and objective of feeling your word declares that by your stripes are in guilt if you didn't want me now some of us need to be bold I know it might sound rude but the prophet says God likes rugged faith he likes a man who is really believing it and if you can really hold you then say Lord if you don't want me to get ill you shouldn't have written this in your word because till the day I die I will believe this word that by your stripes I healed amen you didn't write there by the stripes of Jesus the people are healed except this person I am included in that verse and God I'm going to stay with this verse and if you didn't want me to have it you shouldn't have written it hmm you see you got to find out first if it's God's will is it God's word for us to be healed he sent his word and he allowed our sicknesses right then your motive and objective is to do the will of God then speak to it stand there it'll come down you see if you get the conditions right but you've got to get the conditions right amen yeah he's talking about the creative word of God must be spoken by the lips of mortal man because God uses men God could have used them use the son he could have used the wind but God chose men what's the matter with the church today there's something wrong in my opinion we're not coming with that sincerity to the right thing for that see these spiritual Diagnostics now to see why what is the problem amen is quoting again Mark 11 23 about the mountain he says where's the Pentecostal church at today where's the message church at today you don't realize that confess truly confess sin amid sin it builds a bridge across the chasm that takes man back into the presence of his creator and makes him a Son of God Amen he that believeth on me the works that I do shall you do also brother son he was telling me he was trying to talk to somebody and they said no we are not deity they can't believe that deity is in man you know what they have unbelief in their life yes they don't have the faith to raise up to that level to believe that the holy spirit in them is God and His creative power amen praise the Lord amen see in 30 37 he says when Elijah drop the Rope for Elisha you got a double portion of it Jesus said now he's talking about us receiving a double portion the work that I do shall he do also and greater than the shall he do for go unto my father amen I'm trying to speed it up here now amen you say when your sin is confessed so now if you're gonna unconfessed sin you've got to confess it that's why we're laboring on this point now and confessing under the blood of Jesus then you stand born again because the reason why I'm bringing this some of you may be asking how can I operate in this power how can I operate in this level there's the key confessing under the blood of Jesus then you stand on a doubt made to the born-again Son and Daughter of God with the life of God in you to speak a word of creation let this mountain be moved and it will mind you I mean it will obey you you see we're in Heavenly places we're now in the power of the Resurrection amen if if there wasn't a law to their sons and daughters would create them out in World here and go live a private life on it again a good fire you know brother Brandon you're what the prophet is saying if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters meaning God's got a law to protect you from doing it Sons and Daughters of God would create them a world out here and will live a private life on it you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you you've got power to do it God is omnipotent omnipotent what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it somebody chew quickly true true I know it's hard me tough meat for you you can't believe that you can create a world you create a world around you all the time the atmosphere yeah that's the power in the church now being controlled by it is controlled by a law and the law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's the law of faith right see every place is all of your foot can set upon by your faith God gives it to you it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it amen okay I'm gonna get to my closing culture so now the oldest word that we were created that we were eating all these years so the word we in Genesis 18 now the word that came to Sarah the Lord left a creative word for her she had to believe it right we read in Hebrews 11 11. she counted him faithful you are now talking about the body change how is the new body going to come the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word as the same and the same thing did by Sarah how did the word come into us revelation 10. eat the book eat the message of the hour the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word the same thing did by Sarah when that old body that she had that first body it had to be changed in order to produce a sun you get it that body couldn't do it this body cannot do it so it left to be changed the same way to receive the son so what is Genesis 8 sorry Genesis 18 1-15 I'm going to summarize this now it's a message coming forth to The Chosen bearing ground you who's going to bring forth the Life of Christ right is that what the angel came to do these three men came to give Abraham and Sarah a word came to give Sarah a strength that word strength means power to conceive and bring forth the promised untrue she starts to believe things about herself that she thought impossible now no other message on the face of the Earth has the power to produce this and bring the promise to pass in your life but the message of the hour give God a great type of praise to pray to power is in US amen let's Stand Together Hallelujah praise the Lord I have creative power in me now not tomorrow not yesterday is Hebrews 13 8. amen and even now whatsoever you desire you can have it if you can believe some of you will be walking out of your new organs thank you if you can't believe right now you'll be walking out of here with answered prayers yes yes amen praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah the Lord wants to do it for you but you've got to raise up now and the first thing we want to do if we've learned anything this morning his first approach it the right way let's get rid of all sin all unbelief let's bring it under the blood first then let's pray for into our in feeling of the Holy Spirit that Holy Spirit In You becomes creative power then you've got to feed on the word of God the Holy Spirit takes the promise of God that you're reading that you're believing for and it brings you to pass we read about how God created a hip bone for that boy we read about the withered hand there was a man who came to Jesus without eyeballs and Jesus Took mud and he created eyeballs for that man there was a girl that came to the prophet's meeting and she was blind yeah yeah and the prophet asked her what color eyes do you want you say brother you're not the prophet prophets are secondary hello the word is primary the Reason God sent a Divine gift is because people did not believe the Bible that stepped up in their own denominational Creeds and dogmas so God had to send this Vindicated gift amen God himself had to use his flesh instead of man revealing this son of man and he showed us how to operate the word when he spoke squirrels he was thinking about the word things out of the air he was thinking about the word amen praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord amen you believe he's worthy of praise they believe he's worthy of honor yes amen now I can't confess your sin for you I can pray over you but you've got to confess with your mouth now I'm not saying all of us have sinia but you don't know what's lying in your three generations ago you don't know you need to bring it under the blood maybe you're struggling with a certain thing because of their history right now I want you to cancel it even as you go to speaking to the Lord [Music] amen let's all pray let's go amen father we thank you Lord Jesus that we can

it's dying and Satan is going into a meltdown and the demon is manifesting he says that's even more time to rejoice and thank the Lord until you have the full Victory amen and we thank the Lord for what he's doing amen you know amen about the testimony for the Joshua just come through winter and maybe we can question him did you have any nerve problems especially in Winter you said you had problems so A brotherhood nerve problem and never thought I mean you know brother Joshua is a man of faith but sometimes a mechanic you know mechanics car is probably the worst car he fixes everybody else's car so maybe he didn't think that he needs to pray away but then he has his wife and a family also says you've been complaining about that let me pray over it amen and I know brother Joshua was living off nerve medication I know because he gave me that nerve medication but my hand got sliced shut he gave me that for nerve pain so I remember he says I've got this I'm taking this but in an instant English and it's a simple childlike prayer is completely healed amen amen what a saving no one loves tablets to buy how many of you want to make savings [Music] now I told you we are too reliant on Medicaid when we got miraculate we all got miracle in amen and we don't use miraculate I'm still waiting for sister Lily's testimony amen but she will tell you she was supposed to go for surgery was it every two years every year every two years she didn't disclose me what it was your sister asked him if you went for a checkup and the doctor said you don't have to go for surgery completely gone amen what is that creative power some of you don't even realize but through the preaching of the word sicknesses and diseases have left you yes amen demon powers have left you yes amen amen Hallelujah and you may not be seeing me call you here in the front all the time to lands upon you even the last prayer line you notice I didn't get into the prayer line I let the brothers get into the prayer line because the Bible says if you believe it doesn't say the pastor believes we need to equip the church and get them to a place where they believe amen and they land on the sick and they shall recover amen I'm not here to bring myself and bring myself up to a platform that usually is coming to me I'm here to equip you that you can become a disciple and then you can pray for others you spreading the gospel amen and that's how you Empower and that's how the kingdom of God is manifest the kingdom of God is not with word only amen but in power and demonstration amen we've got to believe what we are preaching it must be backed up so even now some of you are going to come back with testimonies some of you are going to come back with testimony in fact already you can see the testimonies coming back and you're going to testify What the Lord Has Done amen no confound signs you're confound amen the scientific world because you are doing the Greater Works because greater is he that is in me amen then the fourth horse rider amen can any demon power glory be to his name amen so God bless you we love you appreciate you amen we'll meet again on Wednesday Lord willing and maybe brother Joshua the son this Friday we can do that Zoom call amen we wanted to do a Bible study or a quick uh meeting together on Zoom so we suggested Friday so if everybody is good with that day we'll have it at seven o'clock on Friday amen just get together amen when the world is trying to get a bit uh partying we'll party with the things of God amen amen but get involved with the things of God just Fellowship around the word we won't be like too long we'll see how the spirit leads amen we got testimonies the last time through the zoom call people were healed people were set free people were delivered so the power of God is moving depends are you willing to connect with the power of God Amen we have many other testimonies here and maybe we need to have a testimony night okay we need to have a testimony night amen but now if I say we're going to have it Wednesday you used to not come to church on the Wednesday right am I right shouldn't the Lord do a new thing here this morning in your posture you never used to come to church and the wind is dead so we can't have it anytime a testimony night you know I was getting testimony about the early Believers and I I remember this because I grew up in church and you couldn't stop the people from testifying they used to pop up and just like testify testify testify this that even if they found five grand on the ground and they were praying for they were coming in the front and say I thank you Lord I found this but they were grateful for all things amen I think too many times we don't give the Lord Praise we too shy amen God can't use as if we shall the reason he healed you of that thing the reason he delivered you of it is for you to testify amen because your testimony can influence and change the life of others so if somebody else is sick and say the Lord Heal Me it can heal you but now I also want to tell you this quickly don't just give us a random prayer request everyone who got healed came to Jesus personally or they had somebody who came right they brought the man on that stretcher into the presence of Jesus so somebody wants healing don't just think God's good they must be hungry for God in church you know why they want to use God for the benefits oh I want my healing but then they go on living their life of sin they want to be used God is now like a lucky charm no you tell them God can deliver you God can change you without God can give you a job but come to church hear the word of God amen God bless you amen we'll meet again on Wednesday Hallelujah
