[0:00] Amen. Amen. Amen. The Bible says in
[0:02] Revelation 30 11, "And I beheld another
[0:06] beast coming out of the earth, and he
[0:08] had two arms like a lamb, and he spake
[0:11] as a dragon. And he exercised all the
[0:14] power of the first beast before him, and
[0:18] cause of the earth, and them which dwell
[0:20] therein to worship the first beast,
[0:23] whose deadly wound was healed. and he
[0:26] doeth great wonders so that he maketh
[0:28] fire come down from heaven
[0:30] &gt;&gt; on the earth in the sight of men. Amen.
[0:33] God bless you. May be seated.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the precious name of
[0:40] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be found in the house
[0:44] of the Lord.
[0:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Around the revealed word of the
[0:47] hour.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; And we are living now in a time and
[0:52] season where it's just not the revealed
[0:54] word.
[0:55] We got to take it out of being revealed
[0:57] to manifest it.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; It was revealed for a reason.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; So now for us to manifest it.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; So the scripture I just read, what
[1:06] you're watching now is when you see
[1:07] America flex their muscle.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can go into a nation, bomb the
[1:12] nation, go out undetected.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; The world marvels at it. The prophet
[1:16] says this fire that fell here in
[1:18] Revelation 13 was atomic power. Yeah.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; And the whole world is wheeling in fear
[1:23] of the United States because of the
[1:25] atomic power that they possess.
[1:27] &gt;&gt; Right now, you're watching that just in
[1:29] this whole week, he was able to start a
[1:30] war and finish a war.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Exercising the power of the first
[1:35] peace.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; In the same week, he signs a peace
[1:37] agreement of a long-standing war between
[1:40] Rwanda and Congo. Able to bring a peace
[1:42] agreement.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then between India and Pakistan
[1:46] also signed a peace agreement. What is
[1:48] this power?
[1:50] Amen.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; But don't be Amen.
[1:53] Alarmed by this kind of power.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; There's another power.
[1:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. A Holy Ghost power.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Divine power
[2:02] &gt;&gt; being displayed in the body of Christ
[2:04] right now.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. That power is no match for our
[2:07] power.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; They can send an atomic bomb our way.
[2:10] Amen. But if it's not time for us to
[2:12] leave, we can cancel that atomic power
[2:14] because brother Brandham says the first
[2:16] born won't fall till this bride is gone.
[2:18] Amen.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's a greater power within
[2:21] us.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; As sons and daughters of the most high
[2:24] God.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; So even as you start to see scripture
[2:27] start to be fulfilled, look for your
[2:29] part of this word.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; Look for your part of the word. Amen.
[2:32] Because faith, you won't get rapturing
[2:34] faith by somebody else's part of the
[2:35] word. You've got to see your part of the
[2:37] word to get rapturing faith.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. But I'm not
[2:41] preaching this morning. I don't want to
[2:42] get into the preachers territory and
[2:44] anointing this morning. Amen. Praise the
[2:46] Lord. So we're happy. Amen. We have with
[2:47] us our brother Ishko, our pastor Ishko.
[2:50] Amen. Let's welcome him. His dear wife
[2:51] Angel. Amen. Give him a good end. Praise
[2:54] the Lord. Amen. Is here with his sister,
[2:57] Sister Annie. And her daughter. I didn't
[3:00] get the daughter's name.
[3:03] &gt;&gt; You didn't even know her name.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; So, I don't feel so bad. Sister.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[3:10] Welcome. Amen. Uh they've always been
[3:13] family friends to us. Amen. Uh if you
[3:16] don't know Pastor Eshko's dad is Pastor
[3:18] Christy Roberts and his mom, Sister
[3:20] Rachel, fellowshipped with us for many
[3:23] years here. Amen. She was a very
[3:25] faithful sister. Sister will love the
[3:27] Lord. Love the preaching of the word.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you if you want to know
[3:32] something, go ask sister Annie and go
[3:34] ask sisterh brother Ishka. Just ask them
[3:37] who was your mother's favorite preacher.
[3:40] They will tell you.
[3:43] Amen. So that's one thing I hold up.
[3:48] My mother used to always say some
[3:50] there's some preacher that she knows
[3:51] that's a favorite preacher. I won't tell
[3:52] you. I'll leave it to guess.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So we really
[3:56] appreciated that you're being in the
[3:57] service. Amen. She was such a tremendous
[3:59] blessing to us. And remember faith
[4:01] doesn't die.
[4:04] &gt;&gt; The apostle Paul told Timothy, "The
[4:05] faith that I see in you, it was in your
[4:07] grandmother.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; It was in your mother. And I see that
[4:10] same faith in you." Wonderful.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; So faith can be transferable. Mothers,
[4:14] you can teach, you can grow up your
[4:16] children in the ways of the Lord that
[4:18] faith is recognizable.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; So, we under a Amen. A great
[4:25] anticipation this morning for the word
[4:27] of God.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a few families not here.
[4:29] Brother Kenzo. Amen. His family not
[4:31] here. I see. Amen. Brother Clement and
[4:34] Brother Jared also not here this
[4:36] morning. Amen. We pray, Amen, that
[4:38] you'll continue to pray.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Continue to pray
[4:43] for one another even as you see the day
[4:44] fast approaching.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; Also make announcement very quickly. So
[4:48] tonight, this afternoon at 4 p.m.
[4:50] there's a combined meeting.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Combined meeting for the
[4:54] believers, the pastors have a desire to
[4:56] unite the body of Jesus Christ.
[4:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when the head is uniting, let
[5:00] not the body and the tail separate.
[5:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes the ley say, "Oh, but
[5:07] the pastors don't want us to
[5:08] fellowship." to know we are creating an
[5:09] opportunity for you to fellowship.
[5:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it'll be at 400 p.m. at the
[5:13] Derban Girl Secondary School. Amen.
[5:15] That's where we have many of our command
[5:18] meetings. It's not an unfamiliar place.
[5:20] So for at 4 p.m. you come expecting a
[5:22] blessing.
[5:23] &gt;&gt; Now remember the prophet says don't look
[5:25] at the veil.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; Always look beyond the veil.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[5:31] &gt;&gt; Because you may not like the veil, but
[5:33] that's God's chosen man.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[5:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet always says,
[5:37] "You may not agree with a man, but you
[5:39] respect the office that he carries."
[5:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So we And remember
[5:44] what we've been preaching about now all
[5:46] these weeks. Character building,
[5:48] character training. So now maybe a test
[5:50] is coming. How you going to react to
[5:52] this situation?
[5:53] &gt;&gt; This brother's now preaching and this
[5:54] brother's now. How you going to react to
[5:56] it? Character building.
[5:57] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; God is building us. Why? He wants to
[6:00] unlock within us that divine power.
[6:02] &gt;&gt; Because power without character is
[6:04] satanic.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But power with character is
[6:06] good for to rule.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; You know there was a trait about brother
[6:08] Brandham.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; They asked the children, they asked
[6:11] everyone. They said, "You know what? You
[6:13] couldn't tell brother Brandham's enemies
[6:14] from his friends."
[6:17] &gt;&gt; Cuz he treated everyone with love.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we can learn from these
[6:22] things. Amen. So I pray that you will
[6:24] come expecting a blessing.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Also on Wednesday, we have Pastor Moses.
[6:29] Amen. From Zimbabwe who will be
[6:31] ministering for us here at 7:00 p.m.
[6:34] Amen. So everyone is welcome. You can
[6:36] invite. You're welcome to bring somebody
[6:38] along. And remember, even though you may
[6:40] subject us to preaching to chairs from
[6:42] time to time, these ministers are coming
[6:44] from Zimbabwe not to preach to chairs.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; They're coming to minister to souls.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So make it make every effort to
[6:52] come into the house of the Lord
[6:54] &gt;&gt; to hear the word of the Lord.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; And faith cometh by the hearing of the
[6:58] word of the Lord. If your faith levels
[6:59] are low, you're wondering why you can't
[7:01] make headway or progress in the things
[7:03] of God. You're not exposing yourself to
[7:05] enough of the word.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by the hearing of the word.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So take advantage of every
[7:11] opportunity we get to come into the
[7:12] house of the Lord because one day these
[7:14] opportunities, these privileges will be
[7:16] taken away.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we don't want to be found
[7:19] wanting them. So our pastor Eshkol,
[7:21] amen, is pastoring a church on uh is it
[7:25] Palia Drive. Amen. Praise the Lord. And
[7:28] uh he's a young man. Amen. Only 36 years
[7:32] of age. So I'm a decade older than him.
[7:36] So all the trump card, Amen. as his
[7:38] elder. Praise the Lord. But we've known
[7:41] him for many years. And Amen. has a
[7:43] desire to serve the Lord. Amen. Has a
[7:46] desire for the people of God.
[7:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; So he's laboring in his part. Amen. And
[7:51] so you know when when when we are in a
[7:53] war,
[7:54] &gt;&gt; you got to unite with other generals.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; So the territory of Phoenix needs to
[8:00] start to feel a united front.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; We are not a divided body.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; You may be divided in your thoughts, but
[8:07] we as ministry are not a divided body.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; I'd rather be on my brother's side than
[8:12] on the devil's side. I don't know if you
[8:13] can agree.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; Though we are many, we are one body in
[8:18] Christ.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; So when we unite you in Phoenix, demon
[8:23] powers have got to tremble
[8:25] &gt;&gt; because we take control of territories.
[8:26] We take control of atmospheres. We take
[8:28] control of things.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have an expectation this
[8:31] morning. I don't want to take much time,
[8:32] but we give you liberty to share the
[8:34] word of the Lord this morning. Pastor
[8:35] Esco, we thank you for accepting our
[8:37] invitation to come and minister the word
[8:39] of the Lord. Now, as a young man, you

[8:44] &gt;&gt; To operate the gift.

[15:42] Bible says when Jesus then lifted up his
[15:45] eyes and saw a great company
[15:49] come unto him, he saith unto Philillip,
[15:52] when shall we buy bread that these may
[15:55] eat?

[15:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; Verse six says, "And this he said to
[16:01] prove him."
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.

[16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; He says to prove him for himself knew
[16:29] what he would do. Philip answers him,
[16:32] 200 penny worth of bread is not
[16:34] sufficient for them that every one of
[16:37] them may take a little.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon
[16:42] Peter's brother, said unto him, "There
[16:44] is a lad here which have five bales and
[16:48] two small fishes. But what are they
[16:52] among so many?"
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Maybe he was 10 years younger, brother
[16:56] Adrian.
[17:00] Amen. Verse 10. And Jesus said, "Make
[17:02] the men sit down." Now there was much
[17:06] grass in the place. So the men sat down
[17:08] in number about 5,000. And Jesus took
[17:11] the loaves. And when he had given
[17:13] thanks, he distributed to the disciples.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; And the disciples to them that were set
[17:20] down. And likewise of the fishes as much
[17:24] as they would.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; And they were filled. He said unto his
[17:29] disciples,
[17:31] "Gather up the fragments that remain
[17:35] that nothing be lost."
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm taking my text from there,
[17:40] right?
[17:40] &gt;&gt; But just before you see that, go to
[17:42] verse 47
[17:44] &gt;&gt; because you must see the dispensation
[17:46] change.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; He says, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[17:50] you, he that believeth on me
[17:53] &gt;&gt; hath everlasting life."
[17:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am that bread of life.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your fathers did eat mana in the
[18:03] wilderness are dead. Amen. Those that
[18:05] ate even food falling from heaven. It
[18:09] felt like heaven, but they all died.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something different from
[18:15] that bread that they ate in the
[18:17] wilderness and the one that I'm going to
[18:20] give you. Amen. That you shall have
[18:22] everlasting life. Can you say amen?
[18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. May the Lord have his
[18:28] blessing to the reading of his word. You
[18:30] may be seated.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; Certainly glad to minister God's word
[18:40] this morning.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh special greetings to all
[18:46] the elders,
[18:48] the office bearer.
[18:50] Amen. And the first first lady, I don't
[18:52] see her. Yes, it's the grace. Oh, she's
[18:54] at the back. God bless you. First, first
[18:56] then now first. Amen. Many times,
[19:00] sister, I in my own life, I know it
[19:03] after the pastor dies, they forget about
[19:07] the pastor's wife
[19:09] &gt;&gt; and they don't realize all the praying
[19:11] and taking care of at home, the big part
[19:15] that she played. Amen. After he died,
[19:17] they don't respect her anymore. And this
[19:20] morning, I want to give you respect and
[19:22] say, God bless you.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; And this morning, I also want to thank
[19:31] my dear friend,
[19:33] Amen, Pastor Adrian. Amen.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; For giving me an opportunity to minister
[19:38] God's word, to have confidence in me to
[19:40] minister.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; And uh
[19:45] I want to say that I am glad to be
[19:48] associated
[19:49] with this gallon soul.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this is not a fake unity.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; Are you here?
[20:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't believe in fake unity.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; If I don't like you, I'm going to tell
[20:07] you, but I'm going to say God bless you.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[20:12] Amen. And uh if you want to speak to me
[20:16] after the service, I will show you our
[20:18] God reveal to me supernaturally who's my
[20:22] true brothers, my true sisters
[20:25] &gt;&gt; via the word of God.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no fake unity amongst
[20:31] believers.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[20:34] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between
[20:36] brotherhood, like I said to you when I
[20:37] was here the last time, there's a
[20:39] difference between brotherhood Amen. And
[20:42] amen being in unity of one faith.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can go fishing. You can have
[20:49] bride. You can have picnic. Amen. All
[20:52] that is brotherhood. That's not what is
[20:55] needed in the message. What we need is
[20:57] true unity by one faith, one baptism,
[21:01] one message, one banner, one doctrine.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; How can two walk together?
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. We going to
[21:13] sharpen one another. Amen. We have to
[21:15] come to a place to realize. Amen. We
[21:18] need one another. We can't go into the
[21:20] rapture without one another. Whether you
[21:22] like me or don't like me, I need you and
[21:25] you need me. Is that right? Amen. We
[21:27] can't go into the rapture without
[21:29] perfect love. Amen. We need one another.
[21:32] And when you forget to pray for one
[21:34] another is where we are in a delay. But
[21:37] when you can realize you need one
[21:39] another.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:41] Amen.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Where the cockus is, that's where the
[21:49] eagles gather. Not for gossip, not for
[21:52] debate, and they feed on the body word
[21:55] of the son of man. So I am glad this
[21:57] morning I am at the son of man revealed
[22:01] ministries.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he's revealed, Amen. then you
[22:07] know who your god is.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't worship an idol. You got
[22:11] to worship a one true living God. Amen.
[22:15] You got to know who's that God.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; Some say,
[22:22] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not gathered for
[22:24] brotherhood.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; We gathered for the unity.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; And we contending. Both of us are
[22:30] contending for the one faith.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you let me down, Amen. then I'm
[22:35] going to be a little bit Amen. have a
[22:37] little bit more load. But if you can
[22:39] just hold on a little bit. Amen. Hold
[22:41] one another up. Amen. Moses won the
[22:44] battle away.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Let me just give you my title. If I
[22:54] don't finish, it's not a problem.
[22:57] Pastor Adrien, my elder
[23:01] will continue.
[23:04] Amen. Hallelujah. My title of my message
[23:07] this morning is gather up the fragments.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Gather up
[23:15] the fragments.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; And I've taken it from my subject, the
[23:21] anointing for rapturing.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you watch the order of the
[23:28] service, our God begin to put things
[23:31] into place.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. spiritual eyes begin to see
[23:36] spiritual things.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. There must be an
[23:41] anointing for faith.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You can't just stop.
[23:47] Amen. And just faith. Because brother
[23:49] Brandham says, "Amen." That I preach
[23:52] what Paul preached. But I'm going to
[23:54] tell you this. When he begin to tell the
[23:56] church, when he shall come, Amen. He'll
[23:58] descend with a shout. He will descend
[24:01] with a voice. Amen. You will descend
[24:03] with a trump. Amen. Many people could
[24:05] not fully understand. Amen. Hallelujah.
[24:08] It took a end time prophet to tell you
[24:10] what the shout is, to tell you what the
[24:13] trumpet is, to tell you what our voice
[24:15] is. We are enjoying what Paul preached.
[24:19] Amen. It got to take you from fake.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you're going to go with me
[24:24] this morning.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; To natural faith.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe the most important thing
[24:37] to an end time believer is the rapture.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Absolutely.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can't hear you.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; How many believers here this morning?
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. The most important thing to you
[24:49] and I is the rapture. Amen. I see so
[24:52] many believers, which is a good thing to
[24:54] get excited about. They get excited
[24:56] about Russia. Amen. Joining Iran, they
[24:59] get so excited. Amen. About the pope,
[25:02] American pope. He get so excited. Amen.
[25:05] How Russia is going to bomb America,
[25:08] which is okay. You can get excited, but
[25:11] I'm going to tell you this morning that
[25:13] is not your promise.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Your promise is the rapture.
[25:20] [Applause]
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; That should do something for you. Amen.
[25:25] I know there's something happening in
[25:27] America. It doesn't affect me too much.
[25:29] It just gets me excited. But when I hear
[25:32] about the rapture,
[25:34] &gt;&gt; there's a change coming.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; That's not my promise.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; I'm admonished by the word. Amen. That
[25:50] changes my life for a body change. Amen.
[25:54] Hallelujah. How does an American pop
[25:56] affect your life?
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:01] Yes,
[26:03] &gt;&gt; you're not fighting there. None of you
[26:05] say South Africa is joining the world
[26:09] war.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, most of you will be in
[26:13] the bunkers.
[26:15] All you brothers, Amen.
[26:18] They're not going to help you.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it got to have an impact.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; When we begin to preach the word of God,
[26:27] the revealed word of God to you, it got
[26:30] to do some changing. Amen. From mortal
[26:33] to immortality. Amen. First start with
[26:35] corruption to incorruption. Amen. Amen.
[26:38] Because there will be a body change. Oh
[26:42] my. I believe I'm not going to see Amen.
[26:44] anybody hopping into the rapture.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to see one eye going
[26:49] into the rapture. are not going to see
[26:52] one hand going into the rapture. Amen.
[26:54] There's a body change coming whe
[27:01] you have Oh my Hallelujah.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; You bypass your inheritance, your
[27:07] theophony.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Watch the last song.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. You bypassed it
[27:13] &gt;&gt; to be tempted by sin.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But one of these days I'm picking
[27:18] it back up. Amen.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. By my
[27:24] offering, my word body, what is
[27:26] happening? I'm trying to flip the image.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; I find so many times in churches, okay,
[27:41] let me start with my church cuz you
[27:43] might get offended.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; When the chorus leader say sing
[27:49] Why only something?
[27:51] &gt;&gt; I asked my church Wednesday
[27:54] because remember it's for worship.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; You know who supposed to sit and watch.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; Is God supposed to be present?
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Why is it when we want to worship? Only
[28:07] some worship and the others don't
[28:09] worship.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:12] You want to worship.
[28:15] I've seen many times ministers stand on
[28:17] the pulpit.
[28:19] Amen. I know I'm not fighting with
[28:22] anybody, right? But everybody is
[28:24] worshiping but they're standing and
[28:26] looking at the people.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[28:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Where is the worship going?
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the leader says worship, you
[28:37] got to worship. When you say sing, you
[28:40] sing. When he say oh my. When I preach
[28:42] it, you got to say amen. What is it? I
[28:45] agree to the word. So let it be. Lord,
[28:48] be unto me thou favor.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to get this touchiness out.
[28:57] Hallelujah. Like all of us. Amen.
[29:00] Sometimes we are down with so many
[29:02] things. But when you get that thing out,
[29:04] you see the freedom come because you
[29:06] say, "Surrender Lord." Amen. I am
[29:08] nothing. I got nothing to offer you. But
[29:10] Lord, help me. Amen. That's a real
[29:13] believer.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[29:21] &gt;&gt; is that right?
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; Lucifer wanted worship.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; But you got to worship.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying be like me. I'm a bit
[29:32] radical, right?
[29:36] &gt;&gt; In your own way.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Worship God. Yes.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; It might be just a simple subject this
[29:43] morning, but you got to worship God. God
[29:47] is an object of worship.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say something. Maybe we
[29:53] won't get to that subject this morning,
[29:55] but you can't. If you have never changed
[29:57] since you in the message, I'm sorry to
[29:59] tell you, you're not in the message
[30:01] because I called the church on
[30:03] Wednesday. What is the shout? Amen. is a
[30:06] sh to pull you out from where you are
[30:09] and bring you into the light. And then
[30:11] if your blood change, you can be in the
[30:13] church and still be the same way.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; If you still the same way for so many
[30:19] years,
[30:20] &gt;&gt; you are not in the message yet.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying you are lost. I'm saying
[30:24] you're not in the message yet. Amen. If
[30:26] we still were the small things.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; We're not in the message yet.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Brother was telling us about the
[30:38] flashlight, sorry, the flashing red
[30:41] light of his coming. Is that right?
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And he tells us about
[30:46] the train. He says that's about the
[30:48] coming of the Lord. When you hear over
[30:50] the inter corner, the train is going to
[30:53] be late.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Everybody begin to relax.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says you go. Amen. The children
[31:00] begin to play. Amen. You leave your bank
[31:03] sometimes unattended all these things
[31:05] and say you can go across the road and
[31:07] buy some peanuts.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you begin to eat the peanuts.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "But when you see those
[31:18] red light flashing,
[31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the boom gate begin to come
[31:23] down." Amen. When he says, "Stop what
[31:26] you are doing." Amen. Gather up your
[31:29] children. Gather up your wife. Turn up
[31:31] your bank. Amen. Is your banks back?
[31:34] Amen. It's ongoing time. Is your bank.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Help us. Amen.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. The train. You may not see the
[31:45] train.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; You not hear the train coming. But it's
[31:49] on in the block. The lights are flashing
[31:51] like Ariel. Pastor Ariel said earlier,
[31:54] you can see the red light flashing
[31:55] everywhere. What has it done for you?
[31:58] Because your part is a rapture.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; What are you doing about it?
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stop the drinking.
[32:11] Stop the smoking. Amen. There was a time
[32:14] you give a little bit of grace period.
[32:16] Amen. Stop the small things. Amen. Raise
[32:19] your faith a little bit. Amen. It's
[32:21] ongoing time. Get it. Get rid of those
[32:24] things. Amen. Don't hold in that. If you
[32:27] just make a decision.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, L.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; You see how God takes control.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Gather up the fragments.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.

[33:19] take me, it's my life. Oh my. If you can
[33:23] understand the red lights are flashing.

[33:27] that lives in you. Amen. There must be
[33:30] an expression. Amen. Of Christ on the
[33:33] earth now. Amen. Don't look for
[33:36] tomorrow. Amen. Today.

[33:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; These are the things got nothing any it
[33:46] got nothing to Amen. to affect you. It
[33:49] has no impact on you. Israel and all of
[33:52] that got nothing. But when I talk about
[33:55] the rapture sins,
[33:56] &gt;&gt; when I say there is going to be a
[33:58] rapture, there should be an impact in
[34:01] your life. That should stir your spirit.
[34:04] That should be a deep falling into a
[34:06] deep. I'm not waiting for the rapture.
[34:09] It's already beun.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Absolutely.

[34:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon tells us it takes
[34:26] atmosphere.

[34:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; For God to step down.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; So, what do you think about the coming
[34:34] of the Lord?
[34:35] &gt;&gt; It takes a special kind of atmosphere.

[34:43] revelation. Amen. We got to be in a
[34:45] certain condition. Amen. You got to meet

[34:53] conditions. Amen. And it takes
[34:55] atmosphere. What atmosphere do you have
[34:58] around you to say that you are in the
[35:01] rapture?

[35:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen.
[35:16] What is that
[35:19] rapture?
[35:22] &gt;&gt; I leave that for brother Adrian.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; I must be careful.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[35:30] There are those that have died on
[35:32] corner.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; But there are those that are not going
[35:35] to see death.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I got to believe this morning.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Am I right, my brother? I'm preaching to
[35:42] somebody that believes they're not going
[35:44] to death. They're going to be
[35:47] translated. Amen. Because before
[35:50] translation, El had a testimony that he
[35:53] pleased God. Amen. He says it's
[35:56] impossible to please God without faith.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[36:20] die or don't die that's not my problem.
[36:23] Amen. I got to believe. Amen. The word
[36:26] cannot be made alive until you believe
[36:28] it first. Confess it with your mouth.
[36:30] What your mouth say and your heart say
[36:33] the same day. If you say to this
[36:35] mountain,
[36:37] it will be removed. And don't doubt in
[36:40] your heart.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; It will be unto you.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. There won't be. There
[36:49] will be some Y will bypass death. Oh,
[36:52] what a time. In a twinkling of an eye
[36:55] and this body is going to change.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't need an undertaker. Yes,
[37:03] &gt;&gt; you won't need some polebearers.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to go pay for a
[37:08] grave site.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Because some angels
[37:12] are going to carry you.
[37:15] There's going to be some uptakers.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.

[37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, wonderful. Thank you. Praise the
[37:28] Lord.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Thank you for that promise.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:33] Hallelujah.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; What are the fragments, the things that
[37:36] are left out
[37:38] &gt;&gt; that is stopping us?
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; From going in this rapture.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. It takes the fullness of the word.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the fullness of
[37:50] the word has returned. Amen. And he says
[37:52] the fullness of the Holy Ghost is now in
[37:56] the bright. Amen. Is the fragments.
[37:59] Amen. That you're leaving one side.
[38:01] Amen. That because he says there is
[38:03] rapturing faith in the tapes and in the
[38:05] book. Amen. In the Bible, everything is
[38:08] in here. What you living out?
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Let me show you something. Amen. This
[38:21] morning,
[38:23] Brother Agent, you got time for me,
[38:25] please.
[38:33] We'll go one way into 4:00 if you don't
[38:36] watch out.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; When I see you stop saying amen, then
[38:39] I'll stop. Right. Don't stop now. Right.
[38:43] Close.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's say something. Amen.
[38:50] We've got quite a bit to say, but let's
[38:52] say something so you go home rejoicing.
[38:55] Amen.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We find out in Luke 9:E1 17
[39:00] it says so they okay let let me say this
[39:04] here because you're going to miss it
[39:07] when Jesus
[39:10] broke the bread.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Many have missed this. Okay, let me say
[39:15] I missed it many times.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; I thought it was only one time.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; But the Bible tells us he done it again.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Absolutely. Yeah. Amen.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; And I will show you what that means in a
[39:27] moment because it's something Amen. that
[39:30] stirred my spirit.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said to follow up. Listen. He
[39:36] said to f up. Amen.
[39:40] These people so many people here.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[39:44] &gt;&gt; He says we need to feed them.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; You know why he asked them? Why he asked
[39:50] for that?
[39:53] You want to firstly let him know
[39:57] &gt;&gt; what's going to happen next
[39:59] &gt;&gt; that none of you as a man can do.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wanted to show that man has
[40:09] incap capabilities.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Is it right?
[40:14] &gt;&gt; They are unworthy to do what's going to
[40:16] happen next. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[40:20] I believe if more ministers can
[40:23] understand to feed the masses, you have
[40:26] an incapability.
[40:28] Amen. And the surrender to the almighty
[40:31] God without the supernatural element is
[40:34] just a little killer.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Brother says that end time
[40:48] bride must meet end time conditions.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He asked him where shall we
[40:55] buy bread that those may eat? He tested
[40:58] Philillip.
[40:59] Said when the Bible speaks about that
[41:02] woman with the crown sir.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; It's a type of the coming of the Lord.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because before my husband
[41:13] &gt;&gt; comes home. Amen.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; I got to find those
[41:17] &gt;&gt; coin
[41:18] &gt;&gt; that was lost.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. But without that one coin.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. She was known as a
[41:28] prostitute.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; But nothing she done was to be a
[41:33] prostitute.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. She just had something that needed
[41:39] to be in place.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; And you know how many times people are
[41:45] failing with this thing that is on the
[41:48] head,
[41:49] &gt;&gt; the revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[41:53] one thing out. Oh my. But this end time
[41:57] bride and then because the Bible tells
[41:59] me at evening time she began to sweep
[42:02] and then she began to look Lord what am
[42:06] I missing Lord? Amen. There's something
[42:08] that is missing. I need to find it.
[42:12] What was it? The res the restoration of
[42:16] the head.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. John the Baptist and then they cut
[42:20] off his head.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[42:24] &gt;&gt; But in 1963,
[42:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say to you, the head
[42:29] shepherd has returned to give you all.
[42:34] [Music]
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; What was lost?
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Restoring of the edge up.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[42:47] [Music]
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Philip said to Jesus simply, "Lord, if
[42:51] we spend 200 pennies for bread, it won't
[42:54] be enough to even give each a little."
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; I believe the test showed that the
[43:01] demand was greater
[43:04] &gt;&gt; than what they could afford. Man's
[43:05] thinking is limited.
[43:07] [Music]
[43:09] Amen.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; I'll try to put two plus two together, I
[43:12] fail sometimes.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; No, I can say I know what two plus two,
[43:16] right?
[43:17] &gt;&gt; But when you try to fix the word
[43:19] together,
[43:20] &gt;&gt; yes.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; And you say this thing sounds good.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Eventually the Lord tell you not good.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; I can understand.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; That's the difference between
[43:31] ministries.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you try to make things,
[43:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Let me go else you're going to fight
[43:45] with me.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:51] Limitation of men.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; At your current condition, can you make
[43:58] the rapture?
[43:59] &gt;&gt; You have some limitations.
[44:03] Or else you'll be raptured.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; That went hard. But
[44:12] &gt;&gt; sometimes
[44:14] Amen.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The truth unveils itself.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. As Jesus Jesus breaks the bread,
[44:22] he gives it to the disciples. Watch the
[44:25] order.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus breaks the bread. He gives it to
[44:31] the disciples and the disciples
[44:34] distribute it to the people.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; The disciples never break the bread.
[44:40] Amen. Jesus breaks the bread and he
[44:43] gives it to the disciples and the
[44:45] disciple now goes and distributes it.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's exactly how the
[44:56] revelation of the seven seals was made
[44:59] known to us in the end time. It was not
[45:02] no pop that done it. It was not man that
[45:05] revealed it. Brother Brham says, "Amen.
[45:08] It is Christ himself that breaks the
[45:11] seal."
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:1, the mighty angel is
[45:15] Christ himself
[45:17] &gt;&gt; handing the book.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; To Revelation 10:7.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:23] Is it right?
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; When you put men's ideas in it,
[45:29] &gt;&gt; confusion.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; That's why it's important you're all
[45:35] under one headship of brother a pastor
[45:38] Adrian, don't look for other
[45:40] interpretations.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; If God called you to be a stay, Amen.
[45:45] And God will give him grace to feed you.
[45:47] Amen. You stay by the tapes. and your
[45:49] pastor. When you begin to listen to all
[45:52] types of interpretation, you corrupt
[45:54] everybody.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; No man. Why
[46:06] &gt;&gt; brother Shan? Because Amen. When he
[46:09] opened the seal, before he opened the
[46:11] seal, there was nobody worthy in heaven.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Nobody was worthy on the earth. Nobody
[46:17] was worthy underneath the earth. So the
[46:19] revelation of the seals wasn't anything
[46:21] to do with the condition of man.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. Amen. Not because of your
[46:28] condition that he brought the opening of
[46:30] the seals. You might have been the on
[46:32] worst person, a rotter in your family.
[46:35] You might have been the lost of them
[46:37] all. But God still chose to open the
[46:40] seals. Amen. Because he needed you to
[46:43] change.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Oh, we bless your name.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Not your condition.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Jesus.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. He needed his word to come to
[46:56] pass. Your He's promised that there will
[46:59] be a rapture.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he opened those seals and he
[47:03] gave it to you.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then it moves you from being
[47:08] unworthy.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't say you unworthy anymore. If
[47:13] you have received this message of the
[47:15] hour, don't tell you unworthy anymore
[47:18] because all the worthy one.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wasn't a condition of man.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[47:36] It was a condition
[47:38] &gt;&gt; right for him to step down.
[47:42] Wonderful.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Christ himself, nobody was worthy.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Caleb, nobody was worthy.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Nobody was worthy.
[48:01] We can go so many directions about this,
[48:03] not being worthy. And you see that
[48:06] mighty angel coming down from Genesis to
[48:09] Revelation.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; And it was not the condition of the man.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; So, the lamb opens the seals
[48:30] &gt;&gt; and send it down to his messenger.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; To reveal it to his bride.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was Christ in a prophet doing
[48:39] it. Amen. And the spoken word is the
[48:43] original seed. Amen. It's already broken
[48:46] for us. Amen. Why are we still trying to
[48:49] break it? Amen. Is already broken for
[48:52] us. The problem is we have not eaten all
[48:55] of it. Something is left out.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Jesus.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Is it right? Amen.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Now watch the masses are fed. They
[49:12] followed a solemn command.
[49:15] Gather up the fragments that remain that
[49:19] nothing
[49:21] &gt;&gt; be lost.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; That is for a specific people.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:33] The word is already revealed but we have
[49:36] a command to gather up the fragments.
[49:40] Amen. Revelation 107
[49:43] revealed all the mystery. Not some all
[49:45] the mysteries but there is no because
[49:48] there's no new revelation but there is a
[49:51] part for you to play because if you stop
[49:53] at the recipe of Revelation 10:7
[49:58] &gt;&gt; you don't have the full picture.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you become a parrot.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Not a prophet of the same message.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you don't stumble.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; You become a messenger to the same
[50:11] message.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; That's a quotation.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Is that right? But you're not the
[50:15] prophet.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; If you stop at Revelation 10:7, you
[50:19] fail. But you have to take Revelation 7
[50:22] because he's giving you all that you
[50:25] need of. You don't need anything of
[50:27] yourself, but you need all the word that
[50:30] was presented so that you become the
[50:34] messengers of the same message.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Let's make it a little bit plain.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; If I tell my wife I want a cake,
[50:48] &gt;&gt; I tell her, she tell me I need oil.
[50:53] I'm stuck now.
[50:55] She has to tell me what it is, right?
[50:57] Oil, flour, eggs, whatever. Whatever.
[51:02] Can see I don't bake cake.
[51:07] And I come back home and I'm expecting
[51:09] cake.
[51:11] If she give me back oil,
[51:14] &gt;&gt; eggs, flour,
[51:16] &gt;&gt; water.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; If she gave me a cake,
[51:22] &gt;&gt; no, sir.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything is lying. All the
[51:27] ingredients is lying in the message of
[51:29] the hour. Amen. To produce rapturing
[51:33] faith. Amen. Don't give me back the
[51:36] ingredients. Give me the product.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory to God.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Powerful. Amen.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[52:01] in the Old Testament,
[52:02] &gt;&gt; wonderful.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; It speaks about people planting grain.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; And the the person of the Lord of the
[52:11] harvest. Amen. It takes
[52:14] &gt;&gt; the harvest.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; But he leaves some.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He leaves some for those
[52:22] that are gleaning.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He leaves some for them that
[52:31] are gleaning. Amen. Because they will be
[52:34] a root at the end time. Amen. That is
[52:38] gleaning. Oh, everybody that has left
[52:42] out something. They had some of the
[52:45] word, but they left some back that is
[52:48] for you and I. the end time root.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; That is for those that are gleaning.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't read your books and
[53:02] listen to your tapes. Amen. How are you
[53:04] going to glean?
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Sunday service and Wednesday service is
[53:11] not good enough.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't pick up those things
[53:17] &gt;&gt; that are left for you. Oh yes. Help us.
[53:20] Yes.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[53:31] &gt;&gt; I got to be preaching to those that are
[53:33] interested about the rapture.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Interested about the translation.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it meets the conditions, we got
[53:42] to be gleaning for the things that are
[53:44] there for our translation. Amen. You
[53:47] can't be eating milk or drinking milk
[53:50] for 30 years, for 30 years. No sir, no
[53:54] ma'am. Amen. You got to get to the
[53:56] strong meat now. Amen. Because there is
[53:58] rapturing f lying in the tents and in
[54:01] the box. Amen. If we stay with the mer,
[54:04] how you going to grow?
[54:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[54:17] Paul lived, he preached, he died.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Luther lived, he preached, he died.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Pastor Christy Roberts, he lived, he
[54:27] preached, he died.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Pastor Ronnie Genan, Amen. He lived, he
[54:32] preached, he died.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; But
[54:38] those of us that are left behind,
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; shouldn't go the same way.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We got to go a little
[54:44] bit further. They've done their job,
[54:47] amen, to bring you thus far. But we got
[54:49] to go a little bit further. Amen. Take
[54:51] that very word that they presented.
[54:53] Let's go a little bit further. Amen.
[54:56] Because there must be a rapture.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham preached and he died.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; It's not his time
[55:09] &gt;&gt; to be translated.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But I believe
[55:14] &gt;&gt; we are here.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to be part of them
[55:18] that believe in the translation of this
[55:21] body change. Come on. Amen. We got to
[55:25] believe. Amen. Our very word. You stop
[55:28] believing you bring doubt. And when
[55:30] doubt she separ
[55:32] [Music]
[55:36] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about entering conditions
[55:38] now.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; The fragments speak to me of a few
[55:44] things. One originality.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; What are left behind is not something
[55:50] new.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; It's from the original bread.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fragment is a result of the
[55:57] blessed bread. It's the balance of what
[56:00] has been. The revelation of the word
[56:03] would always be the same. But we may
[56:05] have to do some gaining.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The revelation will be further
[56:12] unfolding. And it's the joy of knowing
[56:14] it is the produce of the same hours,
[56:18] &gt;&gt; not a different.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; You can't be in a message and deny the
[56:25] message.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; You can't be in a message and deny your
[56:31] prophet.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; You can't.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're the product of the same
[56:36] harvest. Amen. Every preacher that go
[56:38] beyond the pulpit should be the product
[56:41] of the same. You can't be something so
[56:44] special about the
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Prophet sir,
[56:48] &gt;&gt; you're the product.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you want to be eight
[56:56] angels, nine angels yet, but
[57:00] you have to come out of the original.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's see what he says in the
[57:08] first series.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Brother, do you have a watch? Can I
[57:16] is
[57:19] working?
[57:21] Sorry.
[57:23] Hope you got wrong time.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; It's half an hour slow.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Half an hour slow. Okay.
[57:37] close.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Let's see how it goes. I'll bring it to
[57:46] a close. Don't worry.
[57:49] Let's read that first quote from first
[57:52] se I want to show you that I'm not
[57:54] taking it off my own ideas. The first
[57:56] quote uh the first seal
[57:59] he says we have got to step further.
[58:03] We can't have enough faith for divine
[58:06] healing hardly.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; We got to have enough faith to be
[58:11] changed
[58:13] &gt;&gt; in a moment and be swept up out of this
[58:15] earth and we'll find that after a while
[58:19] the Lord willing find where it's
[58:22] written.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; We have to go a little bit further.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:34] Amen.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; He says
[58:39] we've got to have enough faith to be
[58:41] changed, but what we have now is not
[58:44] good enough.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Baron says seven thunders are
[58:53] contained in the seven seals.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why seven tunnels have to be
[58:59] revealed is to give you rapture and
[59:04] faith.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't lose it. Right. We'll come
[59:09] back to the court. You went before me,
[59:10] right? Don't worry. I want to see if
[59:13] they believe what I am saying first.
[59:15] Right. It's lying there. Amen. It's in
[59:19] those seven seals.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; It says, Amen. is this is not for
[59:23] comparing notes. This is not for
[59:26] argument. This is not for church
[59:28] politics. This is for manifestation.
[59:31] Amen. The word being manifested at the
[59:34] same time is not about taking a life and
[59:36] shooting one another. It's about making
[59:39] the word alive.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; What did the prophet say? What they had
[59:53] then was not sufficient enough to take
[59:55] them into the rapture. What they had
[59:57] could not produce the rapture. Pentecost
[1:00:00] could not produce the rapture. The
[1:00:01] message of the hour must take us a step
[1:00:04] further. Everything that is needed for
[1:00:07] the rapture is contained in the books
[1:00:09] and the text. But you have to gather the
[1:00:12] fragments,
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; the nuggets.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Don't stop the recipes.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Then you'll have a flock cake. Yeah.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Why don't you think you are greater than
[1:00:30] the word?
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Sorry for using this term many flop
[1:00:33] cakes.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; In the message.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Why you stopped the recipe?
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; You think you know it all. You somebody
[1:00:42] greater.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got more ministers than
[1:00:53] followers.
[1:00:56] But it's not about it. When we walking
[1:00:59] into the rapture is not greeds,
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; pastor in the front. That one is No, we
[1:01:04] walking together.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; God has just called men of God to preach
[1:01:08] the gospel to get you right.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Get you in the condition for the
[1:01:13] rapture. Amen. We all have to be living
[1:01:15] the word. Whether the pastor preach or
[1:01:17] don't preach, he also have to live what
[1:01:19] he's preaching.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:26] If you take the book
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; from the angel's hand.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; And you just leave it in your mouth. It
[1:01:35] chew and chew and chew and chew and chew
[1:01:37] and chew.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Only chewing.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Sorry for saying that.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; All in the mouth. Chew and chew and chew
[1:01:45] and chew. Amen. Because it's so nice to
[1:01:48] talk. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Father, what a lovely service.
[1:01:53] Yeah.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; And you live,
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; you left the word back in the pastor's
[1:01:59] head.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; But if you make it part of your system,
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; man.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Then where do you
[1:02:06] think the power of God is? Where do you
[1:02:08] see the revelation of the is Christ
[1:02:11] himself? Where do you see it?
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Where is it now?
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Where you thinking faith should be now?
[1:02:19] Yes.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; When it's part of the system.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; When it's not part of the system,
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; then it's only chewing.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Let's go. Father says
[1:02:38] the fragment also speaks to me of
[1:02:40] continuation.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the beginning there was two
[1:02:44] lines of people. Is that right?
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] When Abel died,
[1:02:53] God could not stop.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The line need to continue.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; He raised up a set.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. To continue.
[1:03:05] Amen. Hallelujah. What the plan of
[1:03:08] redemption had to continue. Amen. He
[1:03:10] could not stop at Abel. Amen. And when
[1:03:12] brother Brham had died, Amen. did not
[1:03:15] stop at brother Brham. There's a
[1:03:17] continuation of the word of God. Oh my.
[1:03:21] If you can catch that and there's a
[1:03:23] fragment continuation
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; of this message of the hour.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; The church must continue in his love.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that we may not organize. Amen.
[1:03:40] So that we may not Amen. Hallelujah. Get
[1:03:44] into a religious spirit. Because where
[1:03:46] life is, there is growth. Where life is,
[1:03:50] there's maturity. Where life is, oh my,
[1:03:53] there's power and hope.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; That is a people that have eaten the
[1:03:59] book.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Just testimony upon testimony.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what God is inside, you
[1:04:10] begin to see everything about God on the
[1:04:13] outside. You are so appreciative.
[1:04:15] Amen. Of how good God is. Amen.
[1:04:18] Hallelujah. You begin to see. Oh my.
[1:04:22] Hallelujah.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; But we don't have victory.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Too much word in the mouth. Too less
[1:04:28] word in the belly.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. The fragments eat in
[1:04:33] all our options. Don't leave everything
[1:04:35] for tomorrow.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:42] worship you Lord.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Let's bring this to a place. Amen. Let's
[1:04:47] just say one more thing.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; It also speaks to me of uniformity.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fragments were the remains of
[1:04:57] the blessed bread. It is a part of the
[1:05:01] whole. We are all baptized into one
[1:05:04] body. 1 Corinthians 12:13.
[1:05:07] All that enter the wedding supper will
[1:05:10] be by invitation only. Amen. That will
[1:05:14] produce a garment that was given. Let me
[1:05:17] explain it to you saints. Amen. Brother,
[1:05:20] when you get married in the Old
[1:05:21] Testament, you have to take your
[1:05:23] invitation and you must bring a garment.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; I told my church,
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; I want a new suit for anybody getting
[1:05:32] married.
[1:05:35] Take a garment
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; and the invitation.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, are you with me?
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; The rapture is that not you going to
[1:05:45] wear purple and I'm going to wear red.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; You have been given the garment.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; The full dress
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; in the message of the hour.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your wedding garment was given for
[1:06:01] dressing. Amen. Hallelujah. And he's
[1:06:04] given get your invitation. Amen. In your
[1:06:06] government, heaven is the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:09] None of us is ever going to get into the
[1:06:11] rapture without the Holy Ghost. You've
[1:06:13] got your invitation.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Do you have your garments ready?
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. None of us is
[1:06:22] ever going to get into the rapture
[1:06:24] looking different
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; when it comes to our outlook.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:40] [Music]
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Let me bring you together. Right. The
[1:06:45] gospel will go from the natural Jew
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; to the spiritual Jew
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; and the cycle will repeat.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Back to the Jews.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:59] Brother, give me that first quote. I
[1:07:01] mean, not the quote, the picture.
[1:07:04] Father,
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; the 12 baskets
[1:07:09] of fragments.
[1:07:11] Where is it?
[1:07:13] The 12 baskets of fragments. Brother
[1:07:16] Brandham teaches us, let's learn a
[1:07:18] little bit here, right? Symbolizes
[1:07:20] provisions for the 12 tribes of Israel.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Whether you like it or not,
[1:07:28] there is a Jewish bride.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; And provisions have been met for a
[1:07:34] Jewish bride.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Right. But there's a second time Jesus
[1:07:41] does the same miracle. Amen. This time
[1:07:44] with seven rows and a few fish. Amen.
[1:07:48] And watch what happens when the
[1:07:50] fragments come back. Amen. It comes back
[1:07:53] with seven baskets. Amen. of meat. Oh
[1:07:58] my. Because at the end times, don't just
[1:08:01] eat bread.
[1:08:04] They eat meat.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Seven such ages. Amen. Some meats were
[1:08:12] left out to a gentle bride. Amen. That's
[1:08:16] why it took me to say, "Amen. I have
[1:08:18] come to tie up the loose ends. These are
[1:08:21] the fragments that are left behind.
[1:08:24] Amen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Seven baskets full.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation of the seven seals.
[1:08:34] Revelation of each church age.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; The word was presented to each age.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. But some things were left behind
[1:08:44] by Paul. Some things are left behind by
[1:08:47] some things are left behind by some
[1:08:49] things are left behind. Oh my. What is
[1:08:52] end time bride? Amen. They have given
[1:08:55] up. They have g up those seven basket.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Lord, hallelujah.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Let's bring it. Let's close on that.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. There was a woman in the
[1:09:21] Bible that survian woman
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; worried about her children child that
[1:09:27] was sick.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; She said Jesus
[1:09:34] can you help?
[1:09:36] He says not even how can I give the
[1:09:39] children's bread
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; to dogs.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:46] But he says to her,
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; she says to him, even the dogs
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; can eat the crumbs.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; The fragments I'm talking about,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; the dogs can eat the fragments. Amen.
[1:10:03] That have fallen off the master's table.
[1:10:06] Amen. You know what I like about that?
[1:10:08] He said, "I've never seen
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; amen."
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Such a great faith. Amen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my the crumbs. Amen. The revelation
[1:10:18] of the crumbs. Amen. I've never seen
[1:10:21] such a faith like this.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Saints, let me
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; let me just say this. We can get the
[1:10:36] doubt out.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just get the doubt out.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Everything is lying in the tapes and the
[1:10:42] books. Just get the doubt out. Brother
[1:10:44] Brandham says, "Amen. If you can get the
[1:10:46] people to believe, not even cancer will
[1:10:49] stand in your way." Cancer is so close
[1:10:52] to death. If you're still alive,
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; if you're still alive,
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; that means you still have hope.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Just get the people to believe. Not even
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; cancer.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; What's your problem this evening, this
[1:11:10] morning?
[1:11:11] Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; What is your problem?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; I don't know what is your problem.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; But the word knows your problem.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; He knows where you are lacking. Amen.
[1:11:20] Just get your doubt out. Amen. And you
[1:11:22] see God.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Come on to see now. Amen. Not even
[1:11:27] cancer will stand in your way.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; He goes and teaches you about cancer. He
[1:11:32] says when the cell is bruised,
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; then the cancer gets attached to you.
[1:11:38] Yes.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Many people are sitting here this
[1:11:40] morning that have been bruised.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Spiritually
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; by men, by women, by pastor all so much,
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Satan uses that as an excuse
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; to get a hold of you.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And begins to spread. It begins to
[1:11:59] spread.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Spiritually, we talking now. Yes.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; If you can get your doubt out of the way
[1:12:07] this morning,
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not even that hurt, Amen. will
[1:12:12] stand in God's way. There will be a
[1:12:15] bride that is able to produce this
[1:12:18] rapturing faith that I'm talking about.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Let me read one quotation because
[1:12:29] just bring this together, brother. Let
[1:12:30] me read the last the second last quote.
[1:12:34] and we'll all stand after that. He says,
[1:12:37] "I truly believe before the church can
[1:12:39] have the rapture, he's got to have
[1:12:41] rapturing faith."
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; We can't even have faith for divine
[1:12:46] healing, let alone rapturing faith. Got
[1:12:49] to have a faith that will change and
[1:12:51] quicken this body. Amen. That's more
[1:12:54] than just the bread. Amen. Just amen.
[1:12:57] Healing your body. Amen. He says you
[1:12:59] don't even have
[1:13:02] for divine healing, later on rapturing
[1:13:05] faith. God will have a faith that will
[1:13:07] change and quicken his body and it will
[1:13:10] be taken away. I believe there's a
[1:13:12] church on its road tonight.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I say the same thing to you
[1:13:18] this morning? There is a church on it
[1:13:21] way this morning.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; A power of the living God that men will
[1:13:27] speak the word. Yeah. and your flash
[1:13:30] like lighting and the church is coming
[1:13:32] out.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Not a psychologist, not some of this put
[1:13:36] on make believe, but a real genuine
[1:13:40] anointed Holy Ghost called out church.
[1:13:43] Amen. Can the church say amen? Amen.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Father.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Church on his road down.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Let's go a little further.
[1:13:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Let me get just closer to the last
[1:14:03] quote. I don't want to leave it like
[1:14:05] this.
[1:14:06] It says, "God has a provided way."
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; And now we're moving right on into
[1:14:13] another great age,
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; the coming of the rapture of the church.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; And in this, we're living in the time of
[1:14:22] the restoration of the gifts.
[1:14:25] So when people tell you the gifts must
[1:14:26] not operate in the church, they have the
[1:14:28] open word, they out.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; It's the restoration of all things.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Restoration again. It stumbled
[1:14:38] many of them big fine churches. It sent
[1:14:41] Nazine backwards. It made fanatics out
[1:14:44] of a lot of Pentecost. But just the
[1:14:47] same, God is moving right on bringing in
[1:14:50] the rapturing faith for his church.
[1:14:53] That's right. So tonight, watch it. I
[1:14:56] represent that faith. The faith that was
[1:14:59] once delivered to the saints in a way of
[1:15:01] a divine gift. And then I'm going to say
[1:15:04] this morning, I want to be one that is
[1:15:06] representing that faith. Can we get more
[1:15:10] like that and then representing that
[1:15:13] faith by a divine gift?
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; My hallelujah.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. Amen.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Can you see we got to go fatherise?
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; I take it in.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Take me out of there.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Get your doubt away, saints.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:54] Let's all sing and we're going to
[1:15:55] worship the Lord, right?
[1:15:58] [Music]
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; My faith
[1:16:05] in it will it will take me out from you.
[1:16:12] I'll never
[1:16:14] hurt
[1:16:16] a promise like this.
[1:16:21] One day from eternity,
[1:16:25] chariots will bring forth
[1:16:29] and into
[1:16:32] angels will carry
[1:16:34] me.
[1:16:36] My faith
[1:16:38] in him will it will take me out from
[1:16:42] you.
[1:16:44] I'll never
[1:16:46] hurt
[1:16:48] a promise like this
[1:16:52] one day from eternity.
[1:16:56] Chariots will break wall
[1:16:59] and into his presence he will carry
[1:17:05] me.
[1:17:07] Just hold on. I don't think everybody
[1:17:09] knows the song
[1:17:14] people
[1:17:22] love you.
[1:17:28] [Music]
[1:17:39] [Music]

[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. We love you. We magnify
[1:20:40] your holy name for your glory.
[1:20:44] God,
[1:20:47] Lord God, we love you. We adore you. We
[1:20:49] magnify your holy name. For your rich,
[1:20:52] we deserve it. Lord God, we are so
[1:20:54] grateful Lord that redemption has come
[1:20:57] away. Redemption has brought our sons.
[1:20:59] Amen. Lord God has brought us into speed
[1:21:02] through you. Redemption Lord God has
[1:21:05] wiped our sins away. Redemption has
[1:21:08] taken all our guilt away, Lord God. Oh,
[1:21:12] we love you. Oh, we adore you. Oh, we
[1:21:14] magnify your holy name. Lord God, even
[1:21:16] as I bring your people this morning,
[1:21:19] Lord, many are hurt. Many, Lord God,
[1:21:22] feel afflicted. But Lord God, you are
[1:21:24] more than able to be the one to mend the
[1:21:28] heart. Oh my hallelujah. We don't like
[1:21:31] wounded soldiers. We want everyone in
[1:21:33] the battlefield. Pastor, would you give
[1:21:36] up this morning?
[1:21:38] You shall
[1:21:40] [Music]
[1:21:42] go.
[1:21:44] Hallelujah.
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, we know Enoch was the alpha
[1:21:49] rapture.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the Omega rapture. And
[1:21:53] before he could go, he had a testament
[1:21:56] that he pleased God. Lord,
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; pastor, I bring your people before you,
[1:22:01] those that are really, Lord, interested
[1:22:03] about the rapture.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, you help us, Lord. Forgive every
[1:22:07] sin.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; forgive us, Lord, of every shortcoming.
[1:22:12] The blood still has power.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; It still has power
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; to wipe every sin away. It still has
[1:22:22] power
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; to heal the sick.
[1:22:25] He still has power to restore.
[1:22:31] [Music]
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; He took a nothing and he made an
[1:22:36] eyeball.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; He can take you that feels like a
[1:22:40] nothing and make something out of you.
[1:22:44] Amen. If you can be honest with
[1:22:46] yourself. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. You
[1:22:49] need him more than ever. Amen. And you
[1:22:52] just get that doubt away and watch how
[1:22:54] God moves. Amen. He moves from bench to
[1:22:58] bench, from heart to heart. Amen. He
[1:23:00] just moves. Amen. Brother Brandham
[1:23:02] brought. Amen. A blind man into the
[1:23:05] line.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; He begin to pray for that blind man.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Or he don't even pray.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; He just says go. You will be healed. And
[1:23:18] he says to brother, "And I don't feel
[1:23:21] any different."
[1:23:22] [Music]
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; He says,
[1:23:26] "What's got to do with it?"
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; His word says, "You will be healed."
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan says he went to the back
[1:23:38] and he saw others getting healed and
[1:23:41] testifying. So his friends brought him
[1:23:43] back in the line.
[1:23:47] Brother Bren asked him, "Why did you
[1:23:48] come into the line again?"
[1:23:52] He says, "Because I'm still blind."
[1:23:58] He says, "The first time I prayed, God
[1:24:00] answered."
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; There was no need for you to come back
[1:24:04] in the line.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Then he asked the prophet, "What should
[1:24:08] I do then?"
[1:24:10] He says, "Go and praise God." Amen.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Don't look at your condition this
[1:24:16] morning, saints. Amen. Just when we
[1:24:19] leave here, just go praise God. Amen. If
[1:24:22] you're still feeling unwell, just go
[1:24:24] praise God. Amen. Brother said as he
[1:24:27] began to worship, he said extra extra
[1:24:30] read all about it. Amen. And one day he
[1:24:33] was cutting his hair. He was ridiculing
[1:24:35] him because he's saying something that
[1:24:37] his condition is different. Amen.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; He says, "I am healed. I can see."
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as he begin to believe what he
[1:24:47] is speaking about, his eyes begin to
