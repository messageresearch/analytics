we may stand together in thy perfect will and praise yes in the mighty name of jesus christ we pray give us these mercies and all shall [Music] and mighty name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen that's a pretty good idea okay we have a subject matter here this morning on the gene of god the genealogy of god the gene of god amen amen and i trust the lord who wrote the word and anything that we need to say we need to say what the prophet said you know anything and uh and if there's any uh mystery or revelation or whatever it's got to be scriptural amen and it's going to be understanding hallelujah i believe that we are the children of god amen and we'll catch the revelation yes we'll catch that mystery with the understanding that god has in store amen amen you've got your bible we'll turn to the book of genesis chapter one hallelujah amen you know many times we read the bible but we need to read the bible with the understanding yeah that god has given us the prophet has given us yes because the prophet unveils unfolds and give to us the word of life that we may be sustained amen praise the lord hallelujah glory to god and the bible says in genesis 1 26 the bible says and god said this is what god said amen nobody else god said let us make man in our image now i want you to catch the concept of what god has said in terms of what the word says and we go further amen after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the flower of the egg and over the kettle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is that what the bible says amen but now when he says let us and god said let us make man in our image we need to understand the genealogy and the phraseology of the genesis account of what he is trying to say to us and the only way that we could understand is this is through a prophet through the prophet of malachi 4 revelation 10 1-7 what has been written and how it has been unrailed in the ministry of a prophetic ministry that has come our way yes amen 27. so god created man in his own enemy first he said let us make man in our image but in 27 it says so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created them shall we pray dear heavenly father your words has been read it takes your spirit to unveil what's in your word of god it's been laying there for 6 000 years but father this morning at the son of man revealed ministries we pray dear god that you may yet again unveil the hidden mystery amen of god into the children of your praise may you use the mortal lips of clay that's standing in the helpdesk of god that when you speak father the theophonic words of your realization be made manifest through the spirit to the children of your praise bless us now father we turn the service over to you in jesus christ's name and all shall say amen praise the lord you may take the comfort of your sin amen hallelujah amen yes he's just prepared again just to get in on the body praise the lord amen you're happy amen and i'm so glad that uh the church out here is progressing yes in revelation and in shock i'm so glad to hear many messages that are coming on the help desk of god that god is using the ministers in the church testimonies in the church amen amen and uh having uh your pastor here and having the rest of the ministers that are here i'm so glad that uh things are taking a new turn and bringing you all into a condition that you could be conditioned for the great rapture the grandchildren could be instilled in in your amen so it takes the grace of god and the power of god and the gift of god that is in you to bring to pass those things that god has instilled amen in each and every one of you amen i'm so glad that even brother ramesh i never knew that he was a good song leader i should have stolen him from those days in the stream and i gave the message and then he gave me a hebrew book i see he's standing out here like a hebrew the coaches just coming in and just singing the the wonderful psalms and the the songs that just to create an atmosphere of worship it takes that great gift to be made manifest amen so we want to speak okay as we're getting ready we want to speak about the gene of god amen now here we find in the book of genesis in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth quite correct and then we find in john 1 1 it says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word must be fresh and dwelt amongst us i'm not quite correct now when we look at these things with these things the the word of the lord and the understanding of the word of the lord and we find that the blade was predestinated before the foundation of the world so if the blind was predestinated before the foundation of the world then we need to have some format of understanding the predestinated will of god in our lives that we are called unto the mystical body the church of the living god the bride of jesus christ amen so now we just okay praise the lord amen hallelujah amen all right praise the lord amen so we need to know who god is we need to know who we are amen if we know who we are through the message through christianity we will know god we will understand god and we will know how to worship him and praise him and all the contexts are you would be in our judgment so now what i'm trying to tell you is this that god is a great god and god god is an object of worship amen before he needed to worship he had something in his mind he had you in his mind yes and if he had you in his mind he need to do something to bring you on this side of eternity right from celestial to telesco so that the terrestrial will understand the celestial concept the theophonic concept of of the word of god and then the understanding that comes to you now even as we have read the word of god in genesis 1 26 and and god said let us make man in our image yes amen the thought of bringing this man in our image was a twofold thought of expression why do you say this process because he said and i and he said let them have dominion of the fish of the sea is it natural yes when they say let us make man in our image was it natural or spiritual so he had a concept of dividing his spirit from the spiritual to the natural so that the natural could work out the natural and realize that there is something that god has in store for us amen okay the gene of god all right the first creation of man as a theophany being as a theophany being the first creation of man as a theophany being he was a spirit man he was the word body yes amen okay he said let us make man in our image and when we go into the concept of understanding what he said he spoke to the spirit and when they made that man in his image amen then he said let us make man in our own image yes you know if you realize who you are today hallelujah it will create an atmosphere of great worship amen of great understanding of great make a shift from the natural to the spiritual we cannot divide our attention to the things that god had in store for us yes there's no division there's no difference of opinion the same god with the same idea with the same mind as transposed his thoughts towards you and towards me through a prophetic ministry to come up higher in the realms of dimension so that we will be able to pick and understand the concept of god amen now when he said you let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the earth over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created in him male and female created he again can you say amen amen [Music] all right praise the lord the second creation the second creation of man as a fresh being you and i watch and the lord god formed them at the dust of the ground and break unto his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul man became a living son amen okay the importance of that living show is something of vital importance to you and to me yes yes amen okay that show is our theophany when he brought that out in the beginning he said now he took from the ground he made this man and he made that perfect man am i quite correct yet after a while the genesis account he said it was not good for man to be alone so where was he eve was in the perfect man he was in the perfect man so god had a purpose in that purpose he had a plan in that plan he had a person veteran and the patent needs to be expressed by the plan so his fulfillment of what god has instilled to be made manifest that we may get the results to a prophetic ministry what has meant through the pages of the scriptures to unveil the characteristics of god in our life amen praise the lord amen hallelujah now we find that uh amen praise the lord the dean of god and the gene of man the gene of god is heavenly yes amen i believe we are heavenly yes we are seated in christ jesus in heavenly places brother branham says such a believer's position in christ amen so if we are in the believer's position in christ automatically we are alleviated from the natural cause to a spiritual dimension to hear from a theophany what he has installed in our soul so that we could have rejoicing in so many ways to know that he is a god of reality to make us a son and a daughter of god okay he the gene of god was heavenly the gene of land was empty there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so it is written the first the first man adam was made a living soul and the last adam was made a quickening spirit [Music] hallelujah let let your hearts be troubled you believe in god amen where i go you shall come also amen i will send you another comforter the comforter who is the comforter the comforter is the holy spirit amen amen who is the holy spirit the holy spirit is the indwelling presence of christ's power in your life amen amen now how do we attain it we attain it by acts 2 38 baptize in the name of jesus christ go to water baptism receive the holy spirit and when we receive the holy spirit and nature changes within the confines of you and i amen it changes the nature from natural to spiritual and the spiritual now comes into the natural to act the natural out in the spiritual mass so now we find here as we go out now it says here that the first man the is man the lord is the lord from heaven as israel such are they also that are healthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that's exactly what we are building now we are bearing the image of god amen we are bearing the touch of god we are bearing the things that god has instilled inside of us yes okay now there is a there is certain things that we needed to do and then god by his divine grace and order has told us praise the lord that we uh we need to act out his things now the gene of man that's it you know you were born of your parents mr and mrs so-and-so i come from the lineage of my parents yeah can you say amen amen we are natural we are born natural coming to this world speaking lies being the things amen of what that we're not supposed to do because of the nature that has been uh in us through our father and to our mother nobody can here can say that they didn't go to the doctors all went to the doctors why because we need god created man from the dust of the ground there were 60 elements that were there from the ground okay the calcium like calcium chromium copper iodine iron magnesium manganese phosphorus potassium selenium zinc polybidinium fluoride oxygen hydrogen and sulfur any short of the 16 elements will make you sick will make you sick so therefore you go to the doctor do a blood test it tells you you've got a little bit of this problem a little bit of that problem they give you this they give you that just to cover just to make your flesh happy that you are better for this cause when the son of god we make manifest to destroy the works of the devil amen we are here amen praise the lord so the spoken word body now let us go in corinthians 5 1 to 2. have a building of god amen so this building must dissolve i don't you know for me i'm telling you right now i don't care for this body if we die we've got something again this is all just perishes yes the ones that are going on they are in the sixth dimension in paradise why they lived this life right a word that is live a life that is lived by the word will be the word expressed amen amen they are right there the people that need to be scared is not us it's those that are in the denomination i want to tell you that we made it amen there's nothing that we could say that we didn't make we made it yes heaven and that would pass away my words will not pass away we are the word bright if we have the white bread we have the word if we have the word amen for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle which is all we have a building of god you have a building of god and and house not made with hands not from your father and mother not made with hands eternally in the heavens so in this for in this we grow earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with the house which is from amen our desire a favorite desire to please god and cry to reach out in the try to reach out in the spirit and the passion to know his word that is why you are here is to know his word that is why you are here to exercise that word that is why you are here so that the word make manifest will be the very image succumbing to the things that god has instilled for you praise the lord now we come to you here who is this melchizedek now he says here you bypassed your theophany in the beginning now we have shown you the picture there was elohim hello him and his thoughts the expression he said the only way that i could make a way for the bride now and this is what i'm going to do but you have bypassed the tiafari and become fresh man to be tempted by sin how do you like that and then if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting yes we have looked yet these bodies but the very fact that you are here you're exercising your god-given rights by rapturing faith to understand and to learn the concept of what the spirit is saying for you for today with the understanding with that understanding that you will develop like a character through the message of this hour to become that son and the daughter of god we have not yet in his bodies but god is preparing yeah he says but look where this body receives the spirit of god when this body your body receives the spirit of god the immortal life inside of you he throws this body in subjection to god amen that's why you say the things that i used to do i do them no more amen because your realization of godship of hatred is with an understanding that you need to live a life that is totally worthy of the gospel of jesus christ a life of righteousness yes a life that is pleasing unto god and amen praise the lord so okay now watch this has not taken place as we read here also yeah who is this and if you are here in the air which means speaks of one thing what is a parable a parable is an earthly story with a heavenly meaning amen what is the scripture the scripture requires a mystery requires a scripture brother branham brought that mystery in scriptural notation so that we will have a better understanding of what he has said and who is this melchizedek and if you are here in the air and it speaks about the rapture you take the you take the body to meet the theatre where you are and cut up and go to meet the lord in the air amen so there will be a glorified body yes you will be there because now you understand you are going for the reading supper but you don't seem to understand you are married already amen amen if you are married already and if you're married to christ you put on a new nature amen you put on a new name yes your desires of the flesh go away amen your desire of the spirit comes in you are not in another engagement amen you change the seventh gear in overdrive you are moving into a highway of holiness where there's no bumps where there's no humps where there's no nothing your travel is a travel that god has entrusted you to go with and you are making the trouble a joyous one in the life that you are leading with your family today amen amen praise the lord are you happy amen the gene of god is celestial the gene of god is terroristic okay yes so now in first corinthians 15 40 there is also celestial bodies god made sense to your bodies you know the nine planets uh uh saturn uranus neptune pluto and all these planets these are spear bodies and he also made terrestrial bodies yes you are celestial you are of the land you see now you are here you are enjoying yourself you are enjoying your work you are enjoying where you go you're enjoying what you're doing you understand amen but there is something in that enjoyment that you need to know you need to understand the concept of the word of god amen so when we are eating we are eating the word the nutrients of the word will have the values to succumb to your soul so that the nature of your soul will be the nature of god amen there won't be any difference yes don't be any different the church that is here in phoenix the church that is in australia the church that is in german and throughout the entire universe the world will have one revelation amen and that revelation must be scriptural yes that revelation that god has given through the prophets must stand amen there won't be any difference of opinion there won't be this and death i think so i will do this i will do that you take the word as it is you develop a sense the supersense in your life and the supersense will give to you the added advantage of what you need to know what was in those standards no one knows what we need to know it will take a profit and god bless you amen there are also celestial bodies and bodies telesteel but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terestial is another are you with me church amen amen but when this it says but then when that body a kind of a celestial body when it returns back to the earth it picks up the substance that it once lived in yes amen you see we all have ones that are passed on that are in the graves okay are you with me hang on it is but then when that body a kind of a celestial body this is a kind of when it returns back to the earth it picks up the substance that it once lived in right it's once lived in we know first thessalonians 4 16 when the trumpet of the lord shall sound amen who is going to rise amen that celestia will come and pick up like the cup and what does he say he picks up the substance that it once lived in and then it becomes a glorified body that body is the one that will see the lord jesus in his resurrected bodies now first thessalonians 4 16 and 17 and the seventh seal will culminate yes in the manner in which we have just read and said it will be the physical corporal return of our lord jesus amen amen there are some that will not taste death that will be changed amen amen and the changing of your bodies into the glorification to go and have that wedding supper will be a joy that all these years day of you will say i fought a good white man i understood by revelation amen i moved in the word of god and god has made a way for me so the genealogy of god was being expressed in his thoughts in the manifestation as we go through and read to see it to say that what a perfect body that god has given you amen amen he gave a perfect spiritual body amen yes no perfume can help no edgars and whatever can help i'm telling you yeah you see how when i spoke to you about the concept of understanding let's say i've been invited to your home where you've been invited to home you'll say sister what a wonderful country you made me everything would be okay yeah i took my timer that did this but she won't say what curry powder what condiment she is till you ask and when you ask for the condiments then they'll know she used this coordinates to make the right type of food we have the right condiments to malachi for revelation yes amen the condiments will build up the very same image of christ amen and the image of christ that is going to be exercised in your life and in my life through the son of man ministry where there will be the expression of god in this entire amen what your celestial body is somewhere else is what you are reflecting raise the lord brother sister in the spirit land what you are is what you are amen we could have done many things on a sunday morning yes but why we are not doing it because there is something inside of us telling us no matter what you know sometimes you'll get your husband but you know what's cool let's sleep with the blanket whatever it is no no no no we gotta go we report the chat there's a day there's a alarm i'd be saying hallelujah thank you lord that i came and i listened and understood and you know where i come from and where i am amen hallelujah now the gene of god is sinless the gene of man is born in sin right that is a one in sin shaped in iniquity come to this world speaking life yes nobody that is here including me can say that we never spoke never many ladies you spoke to your way how many ladies you spoke to your husband how many ladies you spoke to your mother how many lasers we were born in sin in shape and iniquity knowing what is wrong and still doing it how many times don't go there don't visit that don't do this don't do that you still want to do it come to this so there is a shortfall shortfall on the encounter of the genesis 2 7 eve account amen that has come up where we are but praise be to god brother sonny somehow god has centered him i believe amen somehow god has made a way that we can come into this message coming to this message believing this message knowing that this message is true amen i have planted it apollo says wanted but it is god that giveth to you hallelujah in john first john 3 verses 9 who who whosoever is born of god does not commit sin now let us evaluate this one it says shaytan and a critic can't get his world speaking lies am i right amen amen yeah he said whosoever is born of god does not commit sin can you say amen amen you are not committing sin why you are born again experience you're born by the spirit born by the word have your spiritual baptism injected into the mystical body of christ it's no longer i just live it requested limited me the things that i want to do i don't do amen why because we have a different nature we have a nature of god it's a sinless nature that is what people can't understand they brew history they give this to you are you happy amen romans 3 verses 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god all of a sudden come short to the glory of god in job 14 1 a man that is born of a woman is of a few days 3 and 10 17. yeah i've got two years of grace i'm coming on and it's full of sorrow sometimes you know i'm not trying to say you you don't have heartaches you don't have this you don't have that you will have you need to overcome yes there you go you go in a white spot you just relax yourself you park your plane under the shade of the tree yes you express yourself to god and in that expression of self and then you are recharged by the spirit of almighty god where now the battery of the devil is running amen you cannot charge up yeah because you are doing something that god wants you to do look up to him yes don't look up to man he is the only one that could make your way amen hallelujah the gene of god is perfect the gene of man is imperfect the reason why we're bringing this to show you now you are attaining that perfection amen perfection can only come true and make casualty ministry amen come on now church let us not reason let us believe only believe amen i believe that pastor ronnie gingham the late pastor ronnie giggin i won't say lee pastor ronnie gang and your spirit lives amen how do you know in spirit lives you are here you heard the word you come through that word you are here he's in that dimension he is listening he is seeing all of you there he is happy not everything is going on right brother ramesh's wife she's happy she's there she's watching him strongly doing all this kind of thing something is happening what is happening the word of god is being manifest something you are here you are hearing from your theophany your tearful recall is an understanding of what the message standard sets for you to do for your family and for yourself and you are doing it in the concept of what the word tells you to do amen in ephesians 4 13 unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ and every bible question must have a bible answer every uh every scripture must have revelation and we are waiting look by our own revelation we are going by the revelation of what the prophet brought to us can you say amen amen and to a perfect man then he says unto the measure of the stature measure is what measurement can you say amen amen measure of the stature of the fullness of christ in the nation what we need to do let's see he says be you there for perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen you see we need perfection amen we are praying and striving for perfection yes amen nobody can blame you nobody we make our mistakes we as dear god forgive us our sins our faults our failings you repent and you move on you move to perfection amen okay praise the lord if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us amen i believe the word is in us amen that is why we are here yes thank you jesus thank you lord thank you hallelujah now the stature of the perfect man let us see in second peter 1 1-8 if these things be in you what things faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and holy spirit brotherly kindness right if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen that's what peter said william went beyond peter and he said it takes perfect love to be there so you need the holy spirit okay we need to understand what is the holy spirit we need to get the holy spirit and if we have that holy spirit and divide our attention to the message of the hour it will develop in us the sense of divine love in the sense of maturity as we read as we pray as we conduct ourselves in the affairs of the message of the hour sometimes you'll say hey i don't know what to do i take this book and i'm reading as i'm reading my ease is closing then after that you say okay let me eat first and then i will eat when you eat when the bread says all the blood when they go to your stomach and your eyes then you say let me have some fruits or whatever i'll relax then you forgot about reading you forgot about praying you forgot about every other thing how can we conduct ourselves in the affairs of the genealogy of god that has been expressed in our lives to be the image of the son and the daughter of god amen so what the holy spirit is saying to you this morning develop a sense of the spirit of righteousness get into your closet you don't worry who's who in the zoo yeah you must worry about yourself in the room hallelujah if your knee is paining put a pillow if your head is paining put your head on the bed pray without seizing develop that habit and see the progress of the prosperity of the spiritual awakening in your life in your family life in your church in everything that goes on according to the world the gene of god is written in the lamb's book of life can you say amen the gene of man is written in the book of life when you're born

shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb from the foundation of the world therefore we come here to worship god amen therefore we come here to serve god death where we come here is because we have a lifestyle and our lifestyle is appealing to the lifestyle of jesus christ amen can you say amen amen praise the lord in revelation 2012 and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were open and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the book in the books

africa will be called up and the rancher will take between nine and whatever as a prophet says yes we need to be prepared for the hour in which we need to go into the rapture amen come on say amen

time they don't seem to understand that time is blending into eternity our coming here is blending to eternity then they have the radio waves the electric electricity sound waves and others what takes up the time what's up facebook all these other things on your phone is taking up your time instead of reading the bible amen very few images amen i'd rather take all your circles and just keep it one side and take it away can you say amen yeah so all these kind of things come we have to have i'm not trying to say cell phones is bad this is bad wait the situation use it in a way that you think it will profit you right amen then we go to find hell where celestial bodies of sinners go when they die that's where sinners go i'm not interested in denominations i'm not interested in all those kind of things they know where they go the sinners whatsoever they know where they go we have a lifestyle we have a dress code we have a word code amen we are being appetized by the word of god amen by the faithful ministry which have the same revelation of the word of god instilled in the gift of god to express the sentiment from the helpdesk of god for the nutrients of the congregants to build up the burden and to the stature of the perfect image of god amen then when it comes to sixth dimension paradise where celestial bodies of christians go when they die that's why we you know we before time god knows the time that you're born the time that you need to go yes amen you can't just say well you know uh i don't know why it just happened i don't know why they happen no everything has a purpose plan pattern and you follow it amen praise the lord furious finish you eat you go home sleep rest relax what you're worried about you're worried about because you don't see your loved one or whatever in the natural sense of what you're living look at the spiritual aspect of the sixth dimension where celestial bodies of christians go when they die and they are in a better place we are in a difficult place we await in the balance and found one thing right let the expression of our faith and the belief in the word expresses the spirit of righteousness that will succumb to our theophonic realization in the hope that we come from god and go to god amen come on our church then in the seventh dimension that's where god is now the gene of god possesses the zoe light you possess the zoe life amen you have the zoe life come on now you turned and you moved around into the spiritual aspect of the world the chin of god needs the new blood that's where we were but we need the new birth now let's see romans 8 30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called amen amen we were in him before the foundation of the world yes we were predestinated if we were predestinated he called us if he called us there was a call there was a trumpet call there was a jubilee call for you and me come on say amen so we are here not by mistake we are here not by mistaking the message we are here by the will and the purpose of god amen and the will and the purpose of god is to make sure that you get in the right church the recording faith that is instilled in your soul will succumb to the to the things of god according to scripture according to the message of the hour amen amen oh wonderful jesus wonderful jesus jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of war and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god what is the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is the word made power in you and me amen is the word with power in you and in me that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spilled so we born of the spirit we've been baptized in the name of jesus christ amen we received the new nature we transferred ourselves from the gene of man to the gene of god we have a zoe life amen and zoey life in the expression of god in this generation jesus christ on two feet again on this earth that's the revealing of the son of man ministry jesus christ who is the word amen hallelujah amen let's go now the king of god is the real you you have a new nature the gene of man the negative view the only nature because now listen very carefully now give to me of your undivided attention let me ever think of what we don't mind give to me of your undivided attention praise the lord here this is what the prophet says in communion because i was born of charles and ella branham in the nature i was a sinner came to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too but down in there too was another nature right was another nature present predestinated was in there was in there by god in the same body the two natures look at the diagram there the gene of god the genome in the two natures watch here what is real two natures in there well i only catered to one amen you only catered for one he had the natural and the spiritual superimposed and now he divided the superimposed image to the dream of god which is the zoe life and you say amen amen as in good i good as a baby first thing you know i became a liar became everything else that's a sinner because i raised up that way but down in there was a little speck of life all the time hallelujah amen amen you are born in shape and iniquity come into this world speaking life but way down in there in the soul was a speck of light you never realized it till now that god was with you god was your robot god was monitoring you god was making a way for you you couldn't understand it so in the later later scriptures like a time he said when he was there matured and moving on into the word realm he says i am no more the son of charles and ella branham then paul said when it please god who separated me from my mother's womb i conferred not with spirits amen he knew the spirit that he had brother branham knew that the spirit that he had so he had to work out they had to work out the celebration with fear and in trembling by the predestination and will and aspect of god to know that they are the son and the daughter of god hallelujah a prophetic ministry has to be made manifest okay praise the lord let's go now watch i said give me your undivided attention the nature of your soul is two dots is god if you're born again if you're born again right the nature of your soul is of god you've got god inside of you amen say amen you've got god inside of you god is taking care of you yes god loves you god takes you to work god helps you in your family god supplies all your need according to the riches and glory god makes all these things for you because you're god inside of you then he says if it's not it's of the world but now watch what he says now what it says now watch it in this body we have this five uh senses that succumb to this body that brought you down all the time we don't want to delve into that once we got the baptism of the holy ghost the holy ghost makes way for you to the word and the word creates an atmosphere and a generic uh generic and a generic answer for you to know that god is pleased with you and god is making a way for you because you are for ordained of god so the body really now we are not interested in can you say amen amen that contacts the outside earth praise the lord amen the spirit now we're not interested memory conscience affection reasoning imagination we're not interested that takes you away you can be in the body you can be lost you can be in the spirit you can be lost but if you have the holy ghost you can't be lost amen come on now church you have your soul in your soul your soul is your control tower of faith or doubt amen right now he said the children is the soul and that's predestinated by god that's where the real seed germ lays is in death amen now watch this guy on the board satan what he's doing he's creating a man is creating doubt look at that arrow is going to doubt look at the gene of god what happens there and the word body where it comes to it comes to flint amen it comes to faith what type of thing like hallelujah that killing every faith lies in the message that should effect lies in their message we're not talking about the common faith commentator for healing this that no we're talking about rupturing faith we need to go into the lecture we need to change our lifestyle we need to change the condition that the atmosphere gets us into come on now the soul is redeemed say amen you are redeemed say amen hallelujah give yourself because it was in sin so god come down by the process of justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and he redeemed your soul right because it was in sin it redeemed your soul how did you redeem your soul what did he do he is a devious soul from hell how happy we are we don't go through hell hallelujah he redeemed and brought back everything that adam lost lord adam lost him too much he was with his wife in the garden of eden eating their fruits bring all these kind of things he went around and did our own thing and that is why we were coming to this from celestial to telescope come into this world done all these kind of things and now god is trying to do something for us can you say amen amen he redeemed and brought back everything that adam lost when he put you in the pawnshop jesus christ and cavalry was your kingdom and redeemer that redeemed you from every curse of the devil hallelujah he redeemed your soul amen say amen amen hallelujah how happy i am for that i like the word redemption redeemed means to be brought back redeemed i said redemption means that the devil put you in the pawnshop and jesus come and take him [Music] redeemed redemption to bring you back to the former estate and condition that you were in amen amen then you are satan's instrument the soul is redeemed he said then you are satan's instrument now you are redeemed and so that's what the world will be the same way redeemed and new heavens and the new earth just like you you are a new creature you are a new creature you are a new creation come and say amen there was no other creation that was made like this creation this way this manner in which god has prepared you to stand on the side of eternity but the main thing now is to the soul which will never die yes your will never die hurry amen you will never know you're not even smiling you will never die the body will die yes the body will be there you will never die but the soul will never die and we must keep that level with god amen amen can you see what i mean yeah your soul will never die it is not this outside sea tastes fear smell and here it isn't it's subject to death and will die but the inside part of you down in here inside that is a person that cannot die see and that's a person that the new life starts from from this new birth and it builds another person you are around that life that's why people can't understand you people can't understand you because they don't understand god we understand ourselves because we understand god you were never a sinner come and say amen you will never listen right let's see invisible unity you never sinned in the first place god don't even know it's the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son of a daughter of god amen you are standing there washed and your old book of divorcements put away and is dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of god god don't even remember it hallelujah god don't even remember it you are the virtuous bride of christ amen say amen amen what's in the blood of christ gracious virtuous sinless son of god staring with a pure unadulterated adulterated underdecorated redwood that he washed by the water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the buddhism of the father before the beginning the same as he was amen [Music] let's go further it's not your fault if you did anything who's going to blame you let's see how did you come to do this it's not your fault you are deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent e so nobody can say you come you did not convert it we come up here with this place because of you you look you're driving nicely you're looking through the window you carry on now what's that your eyes is going there and now you see all this in your way just gives you a bang there one time don't it's no fault of your own but your natural birth you come after e who committed adultery that's the reason you was born an adult you were a sinner to begin with say amen that's right you was deceived into it say amen you had no no it ain't your fault you never did it because that is the germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world god put your name in the lamb's book of life hallelujah please be the god hallelujah amen and amen the bible said death if that soul won't do as it did say do he will even destroy the soul but you see he can't destroy himself and remain calm yes that's right so if that show is of the world it has to be destroyed but if it's eternal with god it never did begin because it's part of god it can never be destroyed amen the church ought to see you amen what the church had to see that now what i'm trying to tell you is define the laws of the genealogy of god through the seven church ages to the age that we came in the odyssea yes now we backed off we are not in laodaisia we are out of laodicea we are in rapturing faith in the spiritual sense of understanding that rapturing fate is instilled in us is making a way for us to develop the spiritual characteristics of god in us to move into the wedding hallelujah so it takes the grace of god yes yes it takes the love from god amen greater love of god that passage all human understanding be constrained in your hearts that you will develop a sense of activity in the knowledge of spiritual application to be a son and a daughter of god may god bless you amen amen shall we pray amen hallelujah most gracious and eternal god thanks we thank you for
