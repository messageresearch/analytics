[3:37] greet you all in the lovely name of our
[3:39] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[3:47] amen and I was just
[3:49] thinking uh I was driving to my house
[3:52] and I've seen this
[3:54] Branch from a tree from one of the Ed
[3:58] edges edges it was broken down by the
[4:02] monkeys and within a day or two it
[4:05] withed it's withering away there's no
[4:08] life in
[4:09] it you know I'm thinking because it's
[4:12] just like the Shar at one time they had
[4:14] life yes but now that the life is gone
[4:17] to the grain amen and the Shu has pulled
[4:19] away yeah when it's pulled away from the
[4:21] original amen then there's no life there
[4:25] amen so the life can only be in the
[4:28] original amen and those that are part of
[4:30] the original you you got to abide in the
[4:33] vine to have life amen you got to draw
[4:36] from the vine amen you got to be part
[4:38] but if you pulled out there's no life
[4:41] you'll wither away amen amen that's what
[4:44] brings the separation between man and
[4:46] God Amen that's what sin brings sin is
[4:48] unbelief and sin brings the separation
[4:51] it brings spiritual death amen so if
[4:54] you're not abiding in the word it brings
[4:56] forth spiritual deaths amen there's no
[4:59] life that's why you can't see the any
[5:02] any product you can't see it producing
[5:03] the fruit
[5:04] amen and the fruit is Christ amen so you
[5:08] got your Bibles we sent tonight to the
[5:10] book of
[5:13] Philippians read the book of Philippians
[5:21] 3:14 coincidentally the first time I
[5:24] ever exalted or ever took the Bible to
[5:26] say something I was called to preach I
[5:29] was in I think I was in Stand n or grade
[5:33] 11 or 12 and it was in this house
[5:38] meeting and this was the
[5:45] scripture so Philippians
[5:49] 3:14 it says I press towards the mark
[5:52] for the price of the eye calling of God
[5:56] in Christ
[5:57] Jesus amen I I press toward the mark
[6:02] amen for the price of the ey calling of
[6:06] God in Christ
[6:07] Jesus amen so it's a pressing towards
[6:10] this Mark amen amen for what for the
[6:12] price yes of what of the High Calling of
[6:16] God in Christ Jesus yes amen and just
[6:21] before you SE be seated with 1 Peter 2:9
[6:25] read 1 Peter 2:9
[6:29] says but ye are a chosen generation yes
[6:34] am a royal
[6:37] priesthood an holy nation A peculiar
[6:41] people that ye should show forth the
[6:44] Praises of him who had called you out of
[6:48] Darkness Into His Marvelous Lights amen
[6:52] you may be seated amen so that already
[6:55] telling you if you are chosen is telling
[6:57] you already you were predestinated M
[6:59] it's already speaking about election
[7:01] amen you had to be elected to be in the
[7:03] royal priesthood yes and royal
[7:05] priesthood had to come by birth amen you
[7:08] have to be B birthed into this royalty
[7:10] amen you have to be birthed into this
[7:13] peculiar people you have to be birth it
[7:15] to be this holy
[7:17] nation amen not your natural birth it
[7:20] had to come by the new
[7:21] birth amen but Paul is saying in in
[7:25] Philippians he's pressing toward I press
[7:27] toward the mark of for the price of of
[7:29] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[7:33] and we know that the bride is the word
[7:36] manifested amen amen and she will come
[7:39] in this hour in this hour amen into
[7:42] perfect harmony with the groom am yes
[7:45] amen that's the ey calling amen and the
[7:49] final prize is when we come into
[7:50] fullness when Christ is fully manifested
[7:53] in his bride and we come into full
[7:55] Redemption yes amen amen and it couldn't
[7:58] happen in any other age
[8:00] until it come to the age of adoption
[8:02] because this is the hour where she is
[8:04] coming into Perfection amen amen because
[8:08] we find that every age was manifesting
[8:11] an attribute amen it was manifesting an
[8:14] attribute of God yes because there was
[8:16] walking in the Faith of Christ there was
[8:18] walking in the virtue of Christ amen
[8:21] into godliness into Temperance all of
[8:23] Christ walking to Patient into the
[8:25] patience of Christ walking to brotherly
[8:28] kindness amen but in this age we can
[8:31] bypass every age manifested a little bit
[8:34] in part in part in part yes but in the
[8:37] final hour Amen in this final age yes
[8:41] for us to come into Perfection it means
[8:43] we have to manifest from Faith virtue
[8:46] knowledge all these things we can't
[8:48] bypass those things but it's already
[8:51] there it was being formed but the
[8:53] Perfection was left until the edstone
[8:55] comes down amen it was left for the
[8:58] final parts yes but for us to come into
[9:00] the final part first we have to come
[9:03] into the new birth
[9:05] amen amen and how how we come because
[9:08] why we were chosen already Yes by
[9:10] election
[9:12] amen we once were walking in darkness
[9:15] but now we are called out other Darkness
[9:17] Into His Marvelous Light what happened
[9:20] it was a shout that came forth amen amen
[9:23] it was a shout that brought it was the
[9:24] evening time when the shout came forth
[9:27] it was the evening time light amen amen
[9:30] and why speaking about evening time
[9:32] because in evening time A Love Affair
[9:34] happens between Rebecca and Isaac amen
[9:38] where it was in the evening time when
[9:40] this love of fair takes place it had to
[9:42] be in evening time and in the evening
[9:44] time a union takes place between the
[9:46] bride and the
[9:48] bridegroom amen and therefore the world
[9:51] will know nothing about it because now
[9:54] she is shut in with him am amen it's a
[9:57] private affair yes you could come and
[10:00] meet him outside but in the bedroom oh
[10:03] in the privacy of his bedroom it's only
[10:05] him and the bride nobody else is allow
[10:08] there
[10:08] amen amen no matter how much you want to
[10:11] shout no matter how much you want to say
[10:13] that you worship God no matter how much
[10:15] you want to profess Christianity no
[10:16] matter how much you profess to be a
[10:18] Christian but as long as you are not
[10:21] elected to be part of the inside the of
[10:23] the Bride then you cannot come into the
[10:25] privacy of the invisible Union amen amen
[10:31] but he says but yeah are a chosen
[10:32] generation amen a royal priesthood and
[10:35] holy nation A peculiar people that you
[10:38] should show forth the Praises of him who
[10:41] had called you out of Darkness amen into
[10:44] his marvelous
[10:46] life
[10:48] amen and 2 Peter 1:4 says whereby we
[10:52] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[10:55] great and precious promises amen that by
[10:59] these ye might be partakers of the
[11:02] divine nature amen having escaped the
[11:05] corruption that is in the world through
[11:08] lust so we are called to perfection in
[11:10] his hour and we are pressing toward the
[11:13] mark for the price of the eye calling
[11:16] yeah but when you was in Amnesia you was
[11:18] living like every other Mortal being on
[11:20] the earth and walking in darkness like
[11:23] every other person on the earth yes
[11:25] walking after the lust of the flesh but
[11:28] now that you are called into the
[11:30] Glorious lights yes amen and you are
[11:32] coming to this Union where now the word
[11:35] is being formed in you amen where you
[11:37] are becoming one with the word yes you
[11:39] are becoming so much like him that the
[11:42] world in this hour we coming to the hour
[11:44] now when the world will mistake you for
[11:46] Jesus Christ amen I'm talking about your
[11:49] characteristics your life and the
[11:51] manifestations of Christ amen because
[11:54] now it is no longer now the literal word
[11:58] just the WR word it's a manifested word
[12:01] amen amen just like in the Old Testament
[12:05] when they were reading the scriptures
[12:07] but the written the manifested word came
[12:10] and took the written word it took the
[12:12] manifested word to bring out light into
[12:14] the written words amen and just like
[12:17] that in this hour it's the one that will
[12:19] walk out of the scriptures amen that
[12:22] will manifest the word that will show
[12:24] light to the written word that will
[12:26] bring life because the Bible says the
[12:27] let it kill it but the spirit give it
[12:30] life amen because what what's come down
[12:32] it's the Holy Ghost come down in this
[12:34] hour hallelujah it's the holy ghost that
[12:36] bring this word if the Holy Ghost says
[12:38] I'll run this Trail again it's the holy
[12:41] ghost that taken this message around the
[12:43] world Amen to the jungles to the Amazon
[12:46] to the mountains to different countries
[12:49] to the
[12:49] highlands Amen to different tribes and
[12:53] Nations how did it happen not the work
[12:55] of a man but the Holy Ghost amen
[12:58] hallelujah a supernatural message and
[13:01] it's for a peculiar people it's for the
[13:03] chosen generation amen hallelujah amen
[13:07] many people can read the same scriptures
[13:09] that you read yes but it's only those
[13:11] that come to the knowledge of the church
[13:13] that now are now striving towards the
[13:15] mark of the price of the eye calling yes
[13:18] because why they know now they they not
[13:21] like every other human being yes they're
[13:23] not like every other Mortal on the earth
[13:25] they know that the Gen of God is within
[13:27] them they know eternal life lives with
[13:29] them they know royalty lays within them
[13:32] they know that the the the the very god
[13:36] of the universe the creator of Life his
[13:39] own gen his own life is laying within
[13:42] her and she knows by faith according to
[13:45] the word that she is now being expressed
[13:47] out each one is being
[13:50] expressed an expressed image of Christ
[13:52] amen amen amen hallelujah everyone got a
[13:57] different part to play in the body yes
[14:00] but everyone is needed in a body amen
[14:02] because why she's one body she's by one
[14:05] baptism she's brought brought into this
[14:07] body amen if the Holy Ghost baptized by
[14:10] one Spirit she's baptized into this body
[14:13] yes amen amen but she might be have a
[14:17] different part to play but she's from
[14:20] that body amen amen so you see someone
[14:24] with a with a different Ministry that is
[14:26] their Ministry don't try and imitate
[14:28] somebody else's Ministry amen God called
[14:31] you to do something stay with what God
[14:33] called you to do because why in this
[14:35] hour you are now coming to Perfection
[14:38] what that means you are now being placed
[14:40] into your position am amen the B
[14:43] Ministry is coming with a word to place
[14:45] you in your position into your rightful
[14:48] inheritance now if I place you in my
[14:52] inheritance you can't benefit from it it
[14:55] is my inheritance but you got to be
[14:57] placed in your inheritance
[14:59] because until you are placed there no
[15:01] one else can benefit from it but when
[15:03] you are there you you'll enjoy that
[15:06] inheritance and not only you will enjoy
[15:08] it because you are enjoying it now you
[15:10] are cultivating the land the bride is
[15:13] going to enjoy and have this wonderful
[15:15] time because everyone is coming to their
[15:17] position so she's now becoming an army
[15:20] an invincible Army she's becoming that
[15:23] super race amen because why she's not an
[15:25] isolated people but she's L she's an
[15:28] army amen
[15:30] there's different units in the Army amen
[15:33] but she's a complete Army amen so when
[15:37] each one is rightful in the rightful
[15:38] place she's going to be this invincible
[15:41] Army she's going to be that super church
[15:43] that's why Satan didn't want you to
[15:45] focus on yourself amen Satan was making
[15:48] you focus on History FOC focus on other
[15:52] Ministries but when it come the time for
[15:54] channeling this word into
[15:56] yourself that's the time for
[15:58] introspection amen and see where the
[16:01] Lord has placed you amen amen
[16:04] yes so so we got to understand what this
[16:07] High Calling of God is in Christ amen
[16:10] Ephesians
[16:12] 1:4 1 verse 4 and 5 says according as he
[16:16] had chosen Us in him before the
[16:19] foundation of the world that we should
[16:22] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[16:25] love having predestinated us unto the
[16:28] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[16:31] himself according to the good pleasure
[16:34] of his will amen
[16:36] amen but you see it requires spiritual
[16:40] maturity there was a time where we
[16:43] were we have to grow up and progress in
[16:46] our walk and each one as he growing up
[16:49] immature fighting with one another
[16:51] quarreling with one another I got it I
[16:54] got this I I saw this word first I saw
[16:56] that first but a mature person when he
[16:59] has knowledge he wants to impart it amen
[17:03] he doesn't get popped up yes he'll
[17:05] humble himself because the mature person
[17:07] in Christ realize that he can't do
[17:10] nothing without the Holy Ghost he always
[17:12] needs the Holy Ghost a mature person in
[17:15] Christ always recognize that they need
[17:18] they are dependent on the Holy Ghost
[17:20] always am you won't go anywhere unless
[17:23] the Holy Ghost leads
[17:25] you and it and it's shown us through the
[17:28] scriptures without the leading of God
[17:30] when the children of Israel followed
[17:32] their own ways they went they angered
[17:35] God and we know what happened to them
[17:38] it's same with the right here we had an
[17:39] example with the prophet amen the Holy
[17:41] Ghost would lead him but because man was
[17:44] pushing him and pushing him and he
[17:45] listen to what they say eventually and
[17:48] we know what had to happen amen yes so
[17:51] therefore
[17:52] any any person that's mature now learn
[17:56] from the mistakes will realize that you
[17:59] can't do nothing without the Holy Ghost
[18:01] amen and therefore you are not
[18:03] interested in all the quarreling yes
[18:05] you're not interested but you are
[18:07] interested in the price you are focused
[18:09] on the price we almost at the finish
[18:12] line now amen we on the last left amen
[18:15] amen that's why Hebrews 61 says
[18:18] therefore leaving the principles of the
[18:20] doctrine of Christ let us go unto
[18:22] Perfection amen yes not laying again the
[18:25] foundation of repentance from dead works
[18:28] and our faith towards God so we are
[18:29] pressing on to Perfection amen yes we've
[18:33] come by justification we've come by
[18:34] sanctification we come by the baptism of
[18:37] the Holy Ghost and we coming now this is
[18:40] the hour where where the Holy Ghost
[18:41] himself must come and say yeah e them
[18:45] this is my beloved people Amen in the
[18:48] hour of adoption hear that voice she's
[18:50] the final voice amen she's given the
[18:53] authority by me yes amen I give her the
[18:56] authority to become the final voice in
[18:57] this day yes I give her the prophecy to
[19:00] I give her the authority to prophesy
[19:02] again more Nation Tong and Kings am amen
[19:07] it's the holy ghost that come and say
[19:09] they are now ready to go and prophesy
[19:12] they are now ready to go forth they are
[19:14] now mature amen they are now ready to
[19:16] take on the Nations they are now ready
[19:18] to spread forth the gospel they are now
[19:20] ready to walk in Supernatural because I
[19:22] will go before them because they are
[19:25] being obedient to my voice I sent my
[19:27] angel before them
[19:29] and if theyken unto my angel then now I
[19:31] will send my angel before them amen amen
[19:35] yes so we find that the bride must
[19:39] recognize their position yes if he
[19:42] doesn't recognize a position she could
[19:44] be squatting on somebody else's
[19:46] inheritance and not benefiting not
[19:50] growing and just being
[19:52] stagnant yes Christ did not call us in
[19:55] this to and to call you to be in a bride
[19:57] to be in orinary person just coming to
[20:00] church amen he didn't call everybody to
[20:02] be ministers he's chosen his fivefold
[20:04] ministry that's by the Bible says the
[20:07] fivefold ministry is chosen even before
[20:10] birth amen they already
[20:13] Chosen and the the gifts and calling are
[20:15] out
[20:16] repentance
[20:18] but every person in the bride of Christ
[20:22] ought to be a Powerhouse of God Amen yes
[20:26] every person in the bride of Christ
[20:27] ought to walk in the Supernatural in
[20:29] this hour amen amen because if we
[20:32] talking about having a continuation of
[20:35] the book of Acts yes there must be a
[20:37] progression from what we read in the
[20:39] book of Acts amen history must repeat
[20:42] itself but in progression amen
[20:45] hallelujah amen the supernatural must it
[20:47] must you know even in the Bible it says
[20:50] Jesus did so many miracles even the
[20:51] books couldn't contain
[20:53] it you couldn't write books about it you
[20:56] know even now they're finding letters
[20:58] and people are speaking they found many
[21:00] letters in history people eyewitnesses
[21:02] of Jesus time speaking about things that
[21:05] he did
[21:06] there because not everything could be
[21:08] contained in the written bible amen amen
[21:11] it's same with the prophet's Ministry
[21:13] there's so much of super natural happen

[21:35] things yes we will remember now and then
[21:37] but there's so many things am that when
[21:39] we start talking about it might be seem
[21:41] that we trying to make an air of
[21:42] ourselves but it's not about that it's
[21:44] people walking in the continuation of
[21:46] the book of Acts it's people that's
[21:49] living in the Supernatural people that
[21:51] become the manifestation of the word in
[21:54] hour amen amen
[22:01] so you got to come into your position
[22:03] amen amen and we know that this journey
[22:06] is always been pressing towards the mark
[22:09] this this journey didn't come okay we
[22:12] working in justification and we stopped
[22:14] there oh we come to sanctification and
[22:16] we stop there we come to baptism of the
[22:19] Holy Ghost and we stop there no we got
[22:21] to see the full image you got to come
[22:23] into the full image of Christ Hallelujah
[22:25] you must come into the full fullness of
[22:27] Christ amen amen because now the
[22:30] feminist part of Christ must be
[22:32] manifested on the
[22:34] earth amen and you've given the
[22:37] overcoming power in this age you are
[22:39] anointed to overcome all the
[22:41] distractions of Leia amen Lea is right

[22:47] where demon power political power and
[22:49] religious power are all join forces
[22:52] together amen but this is hour that you
[22:56] have anointed have been anointed to
[22:58] overcome
[22:59] thank you Jesus amen so we find that the
[23:03] world is full of
[23:04] distractions and Satan has improved
[23:07] himself over
[23:09] time he don't bring distruction that are
[23:12] obvious he don't just take you into a
[23:15] brle he won't just take you to a drug

[23:26] you people that are in your family
[23:28] people that are your neighbors bring
[23:30] things like that Satan will come subtly
[23:33] yes and work his way to try and hinder
[23:36] your walk amen but we are not to focus
[23:40] on the distraction we are need to focus
[23:42] on the Press on am we got to press on
[23:45] toward the price amen
[23:47] amen because we are you must always come
[23:50] back to what what was your reason that
[23:52] you come here God have called you a
[23:54] people who is called by his own name

[23:59] people he called you to be different

[24:03] to be ambassadors of his kingdom yes
[24:05] he's he's called you because he's
[24:07] preparing you now you can't just go and
[24:11] renovate the Earth without a people
[24:13] ready
[24:14] amen and you are the last of the people
[24:18] that will that has to come forth from
[24:20] the bride because until you are ready
[24:23] the other ones out there who are waiting
[24:25] to come on the Earth again they can't
[24:27] come amen they got to wait for you to
[24:29] come to Perfection they are waiting for
[24:32] us the then they say they without us
[24:34] cannot be made
[24:38] perfect amen so we find that we also
[24:41] have trials and testings but it's all
[24:44] coming to perfect the bride amen amen
[24:47] yes James 13 says the trying of your
[24:50] faith worketh patience so what is every
[24:53] test meant to do it's meant to refine us
[24:57] to shape us Amen to shape us into His
[25:01] Image amen that's what he's doing it's
[25:04] all shaping us into His Image yes amen
[25:07] amen and you find that it's also you'll
[25:11] find that each one of us chest are
[25:13] different yes your test will be
[25:16] different from mine amen my test will be
[25:18] different from yours because according
[25:20] to what I'm placed to be according to my
[25:23] position where I'm supposed to be
[25:24] positionally placed I will have a
[25:25] different testing yes amen but you have
[25:29] given the overcoming power amen you have
[25:31] given the power to overcome and he will
[25:33] never give you more than you can enjoy
[25:35] yes amen
[25:36] amen and everything that you need is
[25:39] equipped you with in this hour yes he's
[25:41] given you everything amen you you you
[25:44] lack of nothing you have lack of nothing
[25:46] in this hour Amen to overcome the
[25:50] enemy amen but now we going in our final
[25:53] stretch in the hour to make the Rapture
[25:55] amen yes
[25:59] that's why it says in Luke 21:36 says
[26:01] watch therefore and pray always that ye
[26:04] may be accounted to worthy to escape all
[26:07] these
[26:08] things
[26:09] amen so we must watch and pray not watch
[26:14] with your natural eyes watch with your
[26:16] spiritual eyes walk watch according to
[26:18] what's revealed to you through the word
[26:21] watch according to what the word Wars
[26:23] you of amen amen and how does the word
[26:26] War you that's why you've got to under a
[26:28] covering yes that's why you got to be
[26:30] under a fellowship that's why you got to
[26:32] have the five Watchmen in his hour
[26:34] you've got to come under a pastor amen
[26:37] you got to have a Shepherd otherwise
[26:38] you'll be sheep cannot lead
[26:40] itself sheep got to be led by a Shepherd
[26:43] amen amen no sheep can say no I'm I'm a
[26:47] spiritual person I'm studying the word I
[26:49] know this I know that no a sheep has to
[26:51] have Shepherd now that that's why we
[26:54] that's why I'm speaking about coming to
[26:55] Perfection is our when you are coming to
[26:57] perfection
[26:58] you will understand about total
[27:00] obedience to the word amen yes about
[27:03] being obedient to the word amen first
[27:06] you to come by total separation from all
[27:08] unbelief yes then you know the word says
[27:11] obedience is better than sacrifice
[27:13] because you come what is total
[27:15] submission to the word so total
[27:16] obedience to the word it means you are
[27:19] coming under a full submission amen what
[27:22] is full submission now that is showing
[27:24] your reverence and your love towards God
[27:26] amen amen Lord amen full submission is
[27:29] like a wife if she doesn't come into
[27:31] submission to husband she shows I don't
[27:33] care about my husband I don't respect my
[27:35] husband I don't care what he says I will
[27:37] do my own things no full submission mean
[27:40] you love your husband and then he will
[27:42] do his part it's
[27:44] like I'm venturing into something that
[27:47] I'm focusing on for another message but
[27:49] what I'm saying is when the the wife the
[27:53] bride of Christ coming to submission to
[27:56] Christ then he is obligated to fulfill
[27:59] his Parts Amen to nurture you to take
[28:02] care of you Amen to give you all the
[28:04] things that you have need of Amen but
[28:06] you've got to come under full
[28:08] submission the concubines when he wanted
[28:11] to come and use his name yes use him for
[28:13] benefits amen concubines want to use him
[28:15] for the benefits but they wouldn't come
[28:17] under full
[28:18] submission therefore they can't have the
[28:20] same connection amen the connection that
[28:22] you have amen amen amen amen that is why
[28:27] because the that's why I said the
[28:29] blessings are falling on the earth
[28:30] because of the Bride the blessings falls
[28:33] on the just and the unjust so they
[28:35] enjoying all the blessings using the
[28:36] very law of God they enjoying certain
[28:39] Privileges and blessings but one thing
[28:41] they will never do they can never
[28:43] reproduce Christ amen because they why
[28:46] to reproduce Christ you've got to come
[28:48] in the union he will never come into a
[28:50] union with them amen Christ will only
[28:53] come in the union to a virgin bride and
[28:56] unadulterated one will come
[28:58] unadulterated word into full submission
[29:01] amen amen into full obedience to the
[29:04] word
[29:09] amen that's why you find even in the
[29:12] natural if the
[29:14] wife doesn't come into full submission
[29:16] to her husband she will never replicate
[29:17] her husband she you you'll never see the
[29:20] couple you never see her representing a
[29:23] husband that's why they give you the
[29:24] scripture in Proverbs that he represents
[29:27] a husband if you if you read the
[29:28] scripture properly if you understand the
[29:29] scripture properly she's a represent
[29:31] representation of the husband amen the
[29:34] husband is honored because of the way
[29:35] the wife conducts herself amen amen and
[29:38] for Christ to be honored for Christ to
[29:40] be glorified is the way you will conduct
[29:42] yourself as the bride of Christ amen
[29:46] amen amen so this bride must press
[29:50] Beyond reasoning beyond all human
[29:53] whatever Satan puts in the way whatever
[29:56] comes in your mind whatever you want to
[29:58] do on your own your own humanistic
[30:00] thinking amen you got to go beyond that
[30:04] even you got to bypass you know there's
[30:06] a Battleground going on in the mind amen
[30:09] but you also know that the control tower
[30:12] if you got if you got faith there amen
[30:14] if you got God in the control tower then
[30:16] that must control the spirit amen and
[30:18] then the spirit will control the body
[30:20] amen amen so you got to bring this flesh
[30:23] under subjection Amen to what they must
[30:26] come to full obedience to what what's in
[30:28] the control tower yes full obedience to
[30:30] the words
[30:33] amen amen she must manifest she must
[30:37] walk out of the scriptures in this hour
[30:39] recognizing her position recognizing
[30:42] what she is and as she walks out of the
[30:44] scriptures now she will bring life to
[30:46] the written words amen she bring life to
[30:49] prophecy in
[30:53] hour so we look at the price now we know
[30:56] that is the full manifestation of Christ
[30:59] in his bride yes amen the full
[31:01] manifestation of it it was the full
[31:04] manifestation of God in Christ on the
[31:06] earth he was the fullness of the word
[31:08] that walked on the earth amen and they
[31:12] were looking at the little Temple but
[31:14] what they didn't see was the temple of
[31:15] God was right there on the earth amen
[31:19] amen and that's why he said you
[31:21] destroyed this temple in 3 days time
[31:23] I'll build build it up again
[31:26] amen so we find that if that was the
[31:29] temple of God then he said now what
[31:31] house will you build me yes amen this is
[31:34] the house not made of ends amen this is
[31:38] the house that is been building through
[31:39] seven Church ages in part in Parts until
[31:43] this in this hour amen where is where do
[31:47] now there must be a full manifestation
[31:49] where this bride has come to this full
[31:52] Temple amen the temple of God where he
[31:54] The Headstone come down yes and the sh
[31:57] Glory come and dwell in the temple amen
[32:00] amen it's no longer e board yes where
[32:03] the spirit has departed amen but now the
[32:06] spirit is dwelling in the house of man
[32:08] amen hallelujah the spirit is dwelling
[32:11] in human flesh amen and if the spirit is
[32:14] dwelling in human flesh there must be
[32:16] the supernatural amen because why the
[32:20] supernatural must take place if a
[32:21] Supernatural is dwelling in you then the
[32:23] supernatural must be reflected through
[32:25] you yes amen amen
[32:30] oh if you only can understand that part
[32:32] walk into a hospital room walk into a
[32:35] situation of death amen and know that
[32:38] greater is he that is in you amen than
[32:42] he that is in the world Amen listen did
[32:46] Satan not defeat Satan sorry did God not
[32:48] defeat Satan yes amen amen then where
[32:52] what is disease what is sickness to the
[32:55] demons
[32:56] yes those are
[32:58] spirits right so greater is he amen the
[33:02] one that defeated Satan dwelling in you
[33:04] yes amen then what is that him what is
[33:07] that little Spirit am what is that demon
[33:10] amen amen thank you Lord greater is he
[33:13] that is in you than he that is in the
[33:15] world Amen You' got to recognize that
[33:18] amen so why you worry about a sickness
[33:20] cancer is a spirit it's a demon then the
[33:23] prophet of God teach us all these things
[33:25] yes so if that is a demon but the one
[33:27] that defeated that demon is dwelling in
[33:29] you yes then why do you fear cancer amen
[33:33] amen or any sickness for that
[33:37] matter so we find there must be the full
[33:39] manifestation of Christ in the bride
[33:42] that's right amen Romans 8:19 says for
[33:45] the earnest expectation of the creature
[33:48] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[33:51] of
[33:52] God they have been waiting for this hour
[33:55] yes this is the hour this is the hour
[33:58] where the bride had to recognize who she
[34:00] is yes she come to know who she is amen
[34:04] and what's her part of the prophecy
[34:08] amen and this is the hour where the
[34:11] bride now can move in perfect Faith yes
[34:14] doing the greater work John 14:12 amen
[34:17] he said verily verily I say unto you
[34:20] amen he that believeth on me the works
[34:22] that I should I do shall he do also and
[34:25] Greater Works than these shall he do am
[34:28] because I go to my
[34:29] father now what do you mean by Greater
[34:34] Works he's saying that John 142 Greater
[34:37] Works
[34:38] amen because why is now in the many
[34:41] member body amen it's not in one person
[34:43] not in a one man Ministry amen it's now
[34:46] in a many membered body amen yes amen so
[34:51] you can't say the scripture was healing
[34:54] or the supernatural was just for the
[34:55] days of the Prophet yes it moved now to
[34:58] the Greater Works John 42 amen into a
[35:01] many membered body
[35:06] amen so we find all the way from Genesis
[35:08] to revelation we find as it was in
[35:11] Shadows and types and so forth until we
[35:14] had Jesus coming which was a full word
[35:16] which was Veil before the people and
[35:18] every
[35:19] time when they reading the scripture the
[35:21] word was veiled amen amen but the word
[35:25] that was veiled was he was reading the
[35:27] right there manifested before them but
[35:29] because the scripture was veiled to them
[35:31] they couldn't see him amen and so we
[35:34] find even today if you're going to go
[35:36] back and keep looking at history the
[35:38] word that you're supposed to be
[35:39] manifesting becomes available for you
[35:42] every time you focus on history and not
[35:44] look at the present what God is doing
[35:46] now the word becomes Avail for you and
[35:50] then you won't see the manifestation of
[35:51] the word yes amen but if you are able to
[35:54] look Beyond the Veil amen and see God in
[35:57] your brother see God in your sister see
[35:59] God in your pastor see God working now
[36:01] in the 54 Ministry amen then you see God
[36:04] being manifested before you yes amen
[36:08] amen
[36:10] yes because why this is the hour now
[36:13] where she must produce all of that was
[36:16] brought in the Ser she must come to full
[36:18] Perfection amen amen she everything that
[36:20] was revealed through all the ages it was
[36:23] to be gathered now in the bride amen
[36:26] because why she as the family Spirit the
[36:28] feminist part of him amen because you
[36:30] are part of his faith God's faith amen
[36:33] you are part of his virtue his knowledge
[36:36] his works of his work you are doing amen
[36:40] whatever whatever works he did Greater
[36:42] Works than his yes shall amen amen what
[36:45] what is that for to prove that she is
[36:49] also the word amen if he are the word
[36:52] why must you do that because why you are
[36:54] come you have come to a complete
[36:56] reflection of him yes yes he are
[36:58] dwelling in you you must reflect him so
[37:01] you are proving Now by doing the
[37:02] supernatural by the supernatural being
[37:04] manifested to your life The Works that
[37:06] he did because he did
[37:07] Works he didn't just come and just talk
[37:10] words Jesus didn't come and just teach
[37:13] the word he was doing the works amen
[37:16] amen the Apostle Paul came he didn't
[37:18] just teach the word and he brought the
[37:20] the New Testament but he manifested the
[37:22] word yes the the apostles didn't just
[37:26] teach the word they did The Works yes
[37:29] the brother Bram came he didn't just
[37:30] teach the word he produced The Works
[37:32] amen amen so it must happen to prove
[37:36] that she's part of the word she must
[37:38] have the works as well amen amen works
[37:41] of his works because we are life of his
[37:43] life and he works of his Works amen yes
[37:46] but he said Greater Works than these ye
[37:48] shall
[37:50] do
[37:52] amen so don't look at yourself as just
[37:55] an ordinary person because this is for
[37:57] many member body
[37:59] amen yes so we know when Paul is
[38:02] speaking he bringing the scripture now
[38:03] he's talking about pressing towards the
[38:05] Mark it's representing Our Journey
[38:08] coming to the full adoption in this hour
[38:10] coming to a full adoption and the final
[38:12] part of the adoption we know what that
[38:14] it is that is a change of the body yes
[38:18] because the final part of the body is a
[38:21] complete healing amen so if you can't
[38:23] believe for normal healing for temporary
[38:25] healing how you going to have the
[38:27] healing for something be completely
[38:29] healed from Mortal to immortality amen
[38:32] amen that's the final part of the the
[38:34] adoption this body is going to be
[38:36] changed completely amen
[38:39] amen is going to be taken out of the
[38:41] time element
[38:44] amen so we find that we are Marching now
[38:47] into rapturing Faith amen that's what we
[38:49] doing we pressing towards that now amen
[38:57] so we're in the final lap amen so we now
[39:01] as Paul said let us lay aside every
[39:03] weight every P every thing and just run
[39:06] with this price amen run for with
[39:08] patience for the price that awaits us
[39:11] amen we've been patient we've been
[39:13] receiving the message this message has
[39:15] come for many years from 1965 19 1963
[39:19] the word was opened amen but the prophet
[39:23] I was telling Pastor Adan what a
[39:24] difficult thing it must have been for
[39:25] him preaching among
[39:28] babies can you I mean can you imagine
[39:31] yourself in front of a baby talking
[39:33] mature things talking complete mature
[39:36] language to them it's difficult now that
[39:39] what the prophet was doing at that time
[39:40] preaching amongst Pentecostal babies yes
[39:43] but it was a word St up for a peculiar
[39:45] people amen for the people that was
[39:48] predestinated to come out in an hour
[39:50] that even though that word was St up and
[39:52] even though the prophet wouldn't be here
[39:54] but the Holy Ghost yes the angel of God
[39:58] that one that took the message around
[39:59] the world he's going to go and bring
[40:01] life to it amen
[40:03] amen amen he's going to take this word
[40:06] across and he's going to have an
[40:07] encounter with each one that will come
[40:09] across this message yes it was the Holy
[40:12] Ghost when you received his message the
[40:14] Holy Ghost was part of the work amen it
[40:16] was the Holy Ghost somebody may have
[40:18] gave you a book somebody might gave you
[40:20] a tape somebody might expounded the
[40:21] message to you but he was the Holy Ghost
[40:23] was amen amen that's what makes it
[40:26] Supernatural
[40:28] amen we got to recognize the urgency of
[40:31] the hour amen yes we got to recognize we
[40:34] are now in
[40:35] 2025 it's a critical year for prophecy
[40:38] amen that's right because prophecy is
[40:40] unfolding before our very eyes amen yes
[40:43] amen we seeing right now Nation th T yes
[40:48] they heading for the World War III we
[40:50] know the Third World War come quickly
[40:52] but we know that the bride also W be
[40:54] here when that happens yes but we can
[40:56] see right now
[40:58] what we thought was so calm you know
[41:00] maybe about 10 20 years ago amongst
[41:02] Nations Nation Nations having civilized
[41:05] conversations with each other we can see
[41:07] things tense right now amen we can see
[41:11] moral Decay yes we can see the the world
[41:14] in such a SN
[41:16] condition we can see that we know the
[41:18] church was already deceived amen they've
[41:21] been deceived years
[41:22] ago and we can see the deception that
[41:25] they wouldn't even listen to you don't
[41:27] want even hear from you yes the minute
[41:29] you mention the name William
[41:31] brandham the they don't they will hear
[41:34] all the nice things all if you can take
[41:36] them to the scriptures and show them
[41:37] things it's all fine but the minute you

[43:12] and pray always that they may be
[43:13] accounted worthy to escape all these
[43:15] things that shall come to pass and stand
[43:18] before the son of man yes amen this is
[43:21] the last call for the bride amen this is
[43:24] the hour she must now step fully into
[43:27] Christ yes there's no time to play
[43:30] around amen there's no time for message
[43:33] gossip amen oh message sorry I used the
[43:36] wrong word for message politics yes
[43:39] that's the word I was looking for
[43:40] there's no time for message
[43:43] politics there's no time for strife and
[43:46] envy and so forth not in the hour of
[43:48] perfection amen amen because you're in a
[43:50] final rep
[43:52] now in the final rep of this race
[43:55] pressing to come coming in what into the
[43:57] image of the
[43:59] word what is the image of the word a
[44:01] complete reflection of Christ
[44:03] amen amen you see me you must see Christ
[44:06] I see you you must see Christ amen
[44:11] amen but you find that the world is gone
[44:14] into darkness the world is gone into
[44:17] chaos but this bride has awakened to
[44:20] make herself ready amen what it was it
[44:23] was seven tles that came and under their
[44:25] voices to awaken her out of spiritual
[44:27] Amnesia amen and now being shed through
[44:31] the five-fold ministry to shed light on
[44:33] the same word that was spoken out
[44:35] through the prophet Amen to bring light
[44:37] to it to bring it into a position in
[44:39] this hour to bring it into perfection in
[44:42] this hour to bring it into maturity in
[44:43] this hour where she come to that part
[44:46] that she must now where she come to such
[44:48] into such a fullness of Christ that the
[44:51] part left now is that the sleeping s
[44:53] must be raised up amen amen that is the
[44:57] that the voice of the Resurrection must
[44:58] take place yes amen amen there must be
[45:02] nothing left but the voice of the
[45:04] Resurrection but just before that takes
[45:07] place she must come she must completely
[45:10] be Christ manifested yes she must Mar to
[45:13] the price of the ey calling where
[45:14] fullness of Christ must be manifested
[45:17] and the supernatural must be on display
[45:19] amen amen because why that is taking
[45:22] Christ out of history and showing that
[45:25] Christ is now working in bright form
[45:28] amen Jesus Christ in bright form drawing
[45:31] him out of history there they going
[45:34] speaking to the sick raising the Dead
[45:36] doing the works that he did amen
[45:42] amen but what is doing to do this you
[45:45] must it call you for a total separation
[45:47] yes amen come out of all my
[45:51] people completely a complete separation
[45:54] from the from the thinking from the idea
[45:57] ideologies from The Narrative of the
[45:59] world and the world systems
[46:02] amen and we must come under the token
[46:05] amen the token must be on display yes
[46:08] which is a literal Life of Christ amen
[46:10] yes in each one of us
[46:13] amen and it must be a people that's
[46:16] walking in Revelation and knowledge of
[46:17] the words
[46:20] amen you can't be walking now 20 years
[46:23] 10 20 years in the message and be still
[46:25] teaching your Bible you you're going and
[46:27] you're understanding Bible school
[46:28] lessons sorry Sunday school
[46:31] lessons you must walk in knowledge of
[46:34] the truth you must your knowledge of the
[46:35] word must progress yes amen you can't be
[46:38] sitting under a Ministry that is giving
[46:40] you the word week after week and you're
[46:41] not seeing it it means that you have to
[46:43] come back to the beginning and have that
[46:45] birth right get that birth right again
[46:48] amen because otherwise the world will
[46:51] become low to you the letter that we
[46:53] preaching will become low to you and it
[46:55] will kill you but his Spirit give it
[46:58] life amen therefore you must have the
[46:59] new birth and then you can walk in this
[47:02] amen because to get in there your body
[47:06] your natural body can't take you there
[47:08] amen even now if you climb up the high
[47:10] mountain you can't make it imagine going
[47:12] up yes that's why I think you mentioned
[47:15] that one where did you think about did
[47:17] you consider when the prophet was caught
[47:19] up in the cloud the cloud coming to 28th
[47:22] February but the prophet was caught up
[47:24] in the cloud he couldn't have went with
[47:26] just in the Natural Body
[47:29] yes amen I mean how isn't to be caught
[47:32] up in the atmosphere even when clouds
[47:33] are not form it's higher than that
[47:35] amen absolutely this wasn't a normal
[47:38] Cloud this is not the natural clouds
[47:40] this is the supernatural Cloud formed by
[47:42] seven angels and formed higher than the
[47:44] normal clouds so how when he's caught up
[47:46] there a natural person with his Natural
[47:48] Body can't breathe there yes amen amen
[47:51] consider that
[47:55] amen this is is not normal things right
[47:59] amen this this message is sent around
[48:01] the supernatural yes that's absolutely
[48:04] amen this is centered around the
[48:06] Supernatural is that normal
[48:12] yes
[48:15] amen so we find that we come under the
[48:18] token
[48:20] amen 2 Corinthians 3:6 says who has also
[48:24] made us able Ministers of the New
[48:25] Testament not of the letter but of the
[48:27] spirit for the letter kth but the spirit
[48:30] giveth life amen so how do we press on
[48:33] this 2025
[48:35] now we're in 2025 now how are we
[48:38] pressing on WE dying to self amen yes we
[48:43] must die to self amen come under full
[48:45] submission amen come how do you do that
[48:47] come into full obedience to the revealed
[48:49] word amen amen and we live under the
[48:52] token not just claiming the message but
[48:55] becoming the message yes
[48:57] amen the message must be manifested to
[48:59] us not claiming I believe the message
[49:02] yes but becoming the message amen
[49:08] yes because why this is the hour
[49:11] where foolish virgins are going to be
[49:13] left
[49:15] behind that's right because they were
[49:19] unprepared those that were not willing
[49:21] to come under the revealed word come and
[49:24] manifest become the message amen yes
[49:26] become the word and you can't become the
[49:28] word unless you have a union with him
[49:31] and you can't have a union with him
[49:33] unless you die to
[49:34] self unless you have a new birth amen
[49:37] you have to die to the own nature then
[49:39] you got to die to the things of the
[49:40] world to have the Holy Ghost manifest
[49:42] your life you must have the atmosphere
[49:44] for the Holy Ghost to dwell in amen
[49:46] yes to to walk in the
[49:49] Supernatural the atmosphere in your life
[49:52] must be right for the supernatural to
[49:54] dwell in you which is the Holy Ghost and
[49:56] for the then the prophet said this will
[49:59] not the angel of God won't be happy with
[50:01] this the angel of how many times there
[50:04] was a time where a person was waiting
[50:06] for the prophet and it took long because
[50:08] he was dealing with other matters and
[50:10] then
[50:11] eventually he took the prophet head and
[50:13] thing he traed it and when the prophet
[50:15] came in he just took the head he it up
[50:17] there and he said the angel saw that
[50:19] angel was not happy with
[50:22] that so you got to be conscious of the
[50:26] Holy Ghost amen yes you got to be
[50:28] conscious of his presence in your life
[50:30] amen cuz he's there to guide you amen
[50:33] he's there to show you the way that's
[50:35] why sometimes you you you want to you
[50:37] want to make a decision and and he's
[50:39] giving you that's why you got to be so
[50:41] sensitive and he already is telling you
[50:43] not to do this but you go and do it
[50:45] anyhow yes and the whole thing becomes a
[50:47] mess but when he Le but when you become
[50:49] sensitive to him you become in Chun
[50:51] dream you say no I learned from mistakes
[50:54] now I'm become a amen amen amen you
[50:57] can't be making the same mistakes over
[50:59] and over you got to learn from them amen
[51:03] amen so we got to be pressing on to our
[51:05] trials amen because why we are entering
[51:09] the kingdom amen
[51:11] yes we know
[51:13] that all the the governments everything
[51:16] are all worried about economic
[51:18] crisis they all doing
[51:20] that they had a time in Israel when
[51:23] there was a Siege in Israel while there
[51:25] was a Siege there but God the prophet in
[51:27] the land amen yes amen and when he came
[51:30] back the supernatural took place when
[51:31] when the eventually when the prophet
[51:33] came back you know the when there was a
[51:34] Siege in Saria and the people were where
[51:36] there was actually had to eat the baby
[51:38] and so forth and they were even eating
[51:40] from the doves droppings and things like
[51:43] that from the bird's
[51:44] droppings eventually when the prophet
[51:46] came and the people that besieged them
[51:48] they ran away and left all the things
[51:50] behind whenever the children of God come
[51:53] no matter what economic crisis take
[51:55] place the supernatural will take place
[51:56] as long as God's children are around
[51:58] amen yes
[52:00] amen didn't happen to the to the to the
[52:03] widow woman when the Prophet Elijah went
[52:05] there amen when he asked for a meal amen
[52:09] didn't the prophet speak about the meal
[52:10] offering amen which was the last meal of
[52:12] death is representing Christ
[52:15] amen and it was going to be the last
[52:17] meal that she was going to have
[52:21] but when that was the last me that was
[52:24] that was there but when the when when
[52:26] the prophet came and spoke to her and
[52:28] she was obedient to the prophet when she
[52:31] was obedient to that
[52:32] word the supernatural to place amen so
[52:36] if you come into full obedience to the
[52:38] word it might not seem possible it will
[52:41] be a paradox but when you come into full
[52:44] obedience to the word the supernatural
[52:46] takes place amen amen I think I've spent
[52:49] my
[52:50] time you want to
[52:53] pray so we got to check out our own
[52:55] selves amen amen pressing on yes or are
[52:58] we standing still or are we stagnant are
[52:59] we coming to
[53:01] 2025 are we progressing or are we
[53:04] stagnant amen are we being forced to
[53:06] serve God are we forced to pray are we
[53:11] are we being forced to fast are we being
[53:13] forced to read our
[53:17] Bibles you know your best prayer is not
[53:19] when in front of your front of
[53:21] people your your best prayer is that
[53:23] front of your family yes your best
[53:25] prayer is when your
[53:27] yesen your breast prayer that's how you
[53:29] know you're walking with God when you're
[53:31] driving in your car when you're alone
[53:33] isolated from everybody is your best
[53:35] prayer because there the time you can
[53:37] keep quiet and listen to the Holy Spirit
[53:39] after you speak and watch how he brings
[53:41] things to you amen it's your own
[53:44] personal time with
[53:46] him and then are we committed to Total
[53:49] obedience in this
[53:50] hour the door is closing amen the door
[53:54] is closing because why
[53:57] Gentiles Gentiles had this gospel for 2
[54:01] now it's 25
[54:02] 2025 2025
[54:05] years the gospel must go back to the
[54:07] Jews
[54:10] yes and we know that what's holding all
[54:13] of it everything the only thing that's
[54:15] holding everything now including the
[54:17] resurrection is the bride yes cuz when
[54:20] she come to Perfection that's when the
[54:22] resurrection take place and then when we
[54:24] go up with them then the goel goes to
[54:26] the Jews amen there must be a transition
[54:30] from the bride this bride this revival
[54:32] is taking place the prophet said this
[54:34] revival goes to the Jews amen this
[54:37] revival goes to the Jews they must have
[54:39] the Holy Ghost
[54:41] amen the way you come in they must get
[54:43] in amen
[54:45] amen just want to read this one quote in
[54:48] closing but the purpose of this is
[54:50] seeing you seeing your position in
[54:52] Christ seeing that it's not something
[54:54] that you just stumbled into
[54:56] or something that might have you merited
[54:58] somewhere but it's what God did for you
[55:02] himself not that you were so good that
[55:04] you went to church one night that some
[55:06] poor brother LED you up to the Altar and
[55:09] it wasn't that it was God before the
[55:11] foundation of the world predestinated
[55:13] you to eternal life amen when you get
[55:16] there that day no wonder the four and 24
[55:19] Elders laid off their crowns everybody
[55:22] laid down their crowns everyone fell on
[55:24] their faces they didn't have one thing
[55:27] they could say no preacher no Elder no
[55:30] nothing all praise to the lamb God will
[55:33] gather in him all things at that day
[55:35] amen amen that's in the message
[55:42] adoption oh yes let me this one now God
[55:46] or the Bible said here that Steven spoke
[55:49] of Solomon building a temple and the
[55:50] most high don't dwell in temples made
[55:52] with hand for Heaven is my throne and
[55:54] Earth is my foot stol and where is the
[55:56] place of my rest but a body as thou
[55:59] prepared me amen there you are a body as
[56:02] thou prepared me God dwells in the sture
[56:04] of a man reflecting himself into that
[56:07] being perfect worship God in us being
[56:11] his Tabernacle God manifesting oh how we
[56:14] could stay on that till you would almost
[56:16] suffocate in here from heat notice that
[56:18] God has always at all all time reflected
[56:22] himself in
[56:23] man that was God in Moses look at him
[56:26] born a leader Christ in the time he was
[56:29] born there was a persecution of children
[56:31] trying to find him same it was with
[56:34] Christ and he was delivered in their
[56:36] time so as Christ he was a lawgiver so
[56:38] as Christ Moses went up 40 days and got
[56:41] the Commandments and come down Christ
[56:43] went into the Wilderness 40 days and
[56:44] come back saying you've heard of them of
[56:46] old time thou shallal not commit
[56:48] adultery but I say unto you whosoever
[56:51] lookth upon a woman to last after her as
[56:53] committed adultery with her already
[56:56] all these different things that God
[56:58] reflecting himself you see each time the
[57:01] word is coming but it's coming in a
[57:03] higher form
[57:07] amen
[57:10] okay I want to get to for woman part the
[57:15] prophet gives an illustration about all
[57:17] Roberts he's talking about praying for
[57:19] the praying of Faith the prayer of faith
[57:22] and he's saying all Rob telling the
[57:23] people who touch the radio and they get
[57:25] healed
[57:26] he's saying you don't need that he
[57:28] saying see what he says here how many
[57:32] ever or Rob this morning when he was
[57:34] preaching this morning or Roberts I
[57:35] heard him say something or other about
[57:38] there was faith that of Deliverance
[57:39] praying the prayer of faith of
[57:41] Deliverance he said make your contact by
[57:43] touching radio make your contact by
[57:45] touching something he said the man was
[57:48] doing that so that he could he would
[57:49] give the people something that they
[57:51] could put their hands on something you
[57:53] say I got it now because it told me to
[57:56] touch my ra I got it that's all right
[57:58] but now real genuine Faith doesn't have
[58:00] to touch none of that stuff now I'm not
[58:03] condemning brother or not at all doing a
[58:05] great work and godly man I sure think a
[58:07] lot of him a lot of a Roberts we said
[58:10] too bad we ain't got more of them but he
[58:11] says but what I'm trying to say that
[58:14] Faith does not doesn't need anything
[58:17] Faith believes God's word yes for Faith
[58:20] cometh by see you got the word touching
[58:23] is not touching he said no faith cometh
[58:25] by by hearing and hearing the word of
[58:30] God that anchors it it's there and faith
[58:33] and as it said it has no distance to it
[58:35] faith is right now Faith is here not
[58:38] like it was not like it's there
[58:41] somebody's you understand Faith come by
[58:44] hearing of the word amen amen so we have
[58:47] to come into the fullness of the word
[58:50] amen we got to hear the word we got to
[58:52] eat of the word when you eat and eat of
[58:55] the word
[58:56] then now you are pressing and you are
