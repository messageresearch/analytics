[0:10] Amen. We'll turn to Abac. I want to
[0:13] speak on the time appointed of the
[0:14] father.
[0:16] Amen. The time appointed of the father.
[0:21] Amen. Abac chapter
[0:24] 2. Now let's follow what's happening
[0:26] here. The Lord is going to answer
[0:29] somebody who is speaking to him. And
[0:31] Abac is speaking to him. He says, "I
[0:34] will stand upon my watch and set me upon
[0:37] the tower." So this man is standing on
[0:39] the tower watching. He's a
[0:44] watchman and will watch to see what he
[0:46] will say unto me. So he's under
[0:49] expectation. Amen. This watch is not
[0:52] watching for an enemy. He's saying, "I'm
[0:54] watching for what the Lord will say to
[0:55] me." So he that hath an ear, let him
[0:58] hear what the spirit is saying to the
[0:59] church, and what I shall answer when I
[1:02] am reproved. And now the Lord answers
[1:05] and he says, "And the Lord answered me
[1:06] and said, write the vision." So God is
[1:10] the one that is encouraging us to write
[1:11] a
[1:13] vision and make it plain upon tables
[1:16] that he may run that readth
[1:20] it. So he's asking us also not to be
[1:22] shortsighted and the vision to be
[1:25] selfish.
[1:26] Because if I expect brother Jaffer to
[1:28] run with a vision, the vision must
[1:30] include him.
[1:32] He won't be enthused about my vision
[1:34] about myself.
[1:36] Amen. But if we have a collective vision
[1:38] for the entire church and I give it to
[1:40] you, you can run with that vision.
[1:43] Amen. For the vision is for yet for an
[1:46] appointed time.
[1:49] Now, we all saw the prophet speak
[1:51] something in
[1:52] 1933 about a pope coming out of the
[1:55] United States. He confirmed it again in
[1:58] 1954. But the vision tried and though it
[2:02] tried, we had to wait for it. We
[2:05] couldn't bring it to pass sooner. We
[2:06] couldn't interpret it. We had to wait.
[2:08] Even they did not know that the pope was
[2:11] going to come out of the United States.
[2:13] But a prophet back in 1933 prophesied
[2:15] about it. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise
[2:18] the
[2:19] Lord. The vision is yet for an appointed
[2:22] time, but at the end it shall speak.
[2:26] Amen. Nobody else must speak. The vision
[2:28] must interpret itself. Amen. Amen. And
[2:31] what's a vision? It's the word of
[2:34] God. So the key is wait for it because
[2:39] it will surely come. It will not tarry.
[2:42] Amen. Behold, his soul which is lifted
[2:45] up is not upright in him, but the just
[2:48] shall live by his faith. I want to read
[2:51] one more portion of scripture before you
[2:53] can be seated. In Galatians chapter 4,
[2:55] just read verse 1 and two. It says, "Now
[2:58] I say that the
[2:59] heir, as long as he is a child,
[3:03] differereth nothing from a
[3:05] servant, though he be lord of all." So
[3:09] all of this potential is laying within
[3:10] him.
[3:12] But watch, but is under tutors and
[3:15] governors until the time appointed of
[3:18] the father. That's where I'm getting my
[3:20] title from. The time appointed of the
[3:23] father. Amen. The Lord had blessings
[3:25] through the reading of his word. You may
[3:26] be
[3:27] seated. We'll go quickly to the book of
[3:29] Luke. There we read this on Sunday.
[3:32] Amen. We didn't get too much time to
[3:33] dwell on this, but you know, I'm going
[3:35] to uh skip through a lot of it. So, you
[3:37] know that this man had two sons. Amen.
[3:40] And the younger of them said to his
[3:42] father, "Give me the portion of goods
[3:45] that fall to me." And he divided them
[3:47] his living. So his
[3:50] inheritance. So there's a certain
[3:52] portion of the word that's given to us
[3:54] as
[3:56] well. But this boy didn't make wise
[3:59] investments.
[4:01] You remember we were speaking about
[4:03] talents being given. Yes. Amen. So this
[4:06] boy, he came of age and he didn't wait
[4:09] for the report of the father or the
[4:11] tutor to give to the father. He kind of
[4:14] jumped the
[4:17] gun. And I suspect that this boy was a
[4:20] good student. I suspect that this boy
[4:23] was going to get a good
[4:25] report.
[4:27] Amen. Because you'll see on the return,
[4:31] the father already knew his
[4:32] capabilities.
[4:34] Amen.
[4:36] So he makes a demand of the father for
[4:38] an inheritance, for a gifting, for a
[4:40] portion of the
[4:42] word. So what he is carrying with him
[4:44] and going is the father, what the father
[4:47] has allotted to him. He's carrying the
[4:49] father's inheritance with him. But he
[4:52] squanders the father's inheritance when
[4:54] he should be investing it.
[4:57] when he should be amen uh looking to
[5:00] grow it, he starts to spend it.
[5:06] Now remember the kingdom of God works by
[5:08] multiplication. The kingdom of God works
[5:10] by addition. So it shows you that he
[5:13] wasn't operating in the kingdom of
[5:16] God because everything that was
[5:19] happening to him was
[5:21] subtracting. Praise the Lord.
[5:25] So I want to get to this point because
[5:26] you know he joins himself with a citizen
[5:28] of the country and I told you that's a
[5:30] Leosian spirit. The Leysian spirit can
[5:33] strip you and send you to the pig pen to
[5:36] eat pig food. You all know the story you
[5:39] can read. Amen. I want to get to the
[5:41] point
[5:44] where verse 17. And when he came to
[5:48] himself, now there's only one thing
[5:50] promised to an end time people to awaken
[5:53] them from amnesia.
[5:55] Waken them to realize who they are. And
[5:58] this is not their ought to be condition.
[6:00] And that was seven thunders. Brother
[6:02] Brandham says it will take those seven
[6:04] unknown thunders to wake her up again.
[6:07] Amen. That is the opening of the word.
[6:09] That is the seven seals. Amen. To wake
[6:12] her up again. If we if we are looking at
[6:14] the seals and all we are seeing is o
[6:16] riders and something is wrong because
[6:18] the prophet is saying we need to see our
[6:20] name beneath the seal.
[6:22] Hallelujah. The time appointed of the
[6:25] father.
[6:27] So listen to his words. When he came to
[6:31] himself he said how many hired servants
[6:34] of my father have bread enough to spare
[6:38] and I perish with
[6:40] hunger. I will arise and go to my father
[6:43] and will say unto him, Father, I have
[6:45] sinned against heaven and before thee
[6:47] and am no more worthy to be called thy
[6:49] son, make me as one of thy hired
[6:53] servants. Now, if you just remembered
[6:55] what we just read that the heir, as long
[6:58] as he's a child, defer with nothing from
[7:00] his servant. So, that's the stage he is
[7:03] in now.
[7:05] He's still in the child stage. He hasn't
[7:08] been come to adoption yet. So he must
[7:10] remain in the mentality of his
[7:13] servant. So that's why he's got servant
[7:15] mentality and he's saying I will arise
[7:17] and I will go back
[7:19] and ask my father to make me a servant
[7:22] because I have not been adopted
[7:24] yet. Praise the Lord. Amen. That's as
[7:28] far as I want you to go there. Amen. So
[7:30] you know when he gets back to the
[7:31] father's house, the father has another
[7:35] welcoming for him than he expects.
[7:38] Praise the Lord.
[7:41] Amen. Because in verse 20, he says, "He
[7:44] arose and came to the father, but he was
[7:47] yet a great way off and his father saw
[7:50] him."
[7:53] Hallelujah. No matter how far you away
[7:55] from father, father is seeing you.
[7:58] Father has chosen you.
[8:01] Amen. You can't get away from father's
[8:03] eye. Amen. The father may let you drift
[8:06] for a while, but you are always his son
[8:09] and his eyes on the sparrow and he
[8:11] watches over you and I. Nothing can
[8:14] separate us from the love of God, which
[8:16] is in Christ Jesus.
[8:18] Hallelujah. So no matter how a son and
[8:21] daughter may drift, may may wander away
[8:23] for some time, but at the appointed time
[8:25] of the father, he's going to bring you
[8:28] back.
[8:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So even the boy
[8:34] going away, it wasn't yet the appointed
[8:36] time of the father at that time.
[8:40] He had to
[8:41] wait, Amen. for the right time. He had
[8:44] to go through his own experiences. He
[8:47] had to go through his valley moments.
[8:50] Amen. He had to overcome the leosian
[8:52] spirit. Amen. Because to him who
[8:55] overcomes leosian spirit, to him will I
[8:58] grant to sit with me on my throne.
[9:00] Therefore, after this boy overcomes a
[9:02] leady in spirit,
[9:06] as soon as he comes back to father's
[9:08] house, he's able to sit on father's
[9:10] throne.
[9:13] Praise the Lord.
[9:16] So, but the father said to his servants,
[9:19] so watch now. He says, I want to be a
[9:21] servant. But the father is instructing
[9:22] the servants now. Amen. Last week, we
[9:26] were talking to you about who the
[9:27] servants are. It's the angels.
[9:31] Sons of God are higher than the angels
[9:33] of God. Praise the Lord. Bring forth the
[9:36] best robe.
[9:39] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. When father
[9:43] deals with us, he gives us the best.
[9:46] He is not looking to give us a
[9:48] secondhanded robe. He's saying, "Bring
[9:50] the best robe." Hallelujah. Amen. The
[9:52] best robe that you have and put it on
[9:54] him.
[9:56] Hallelujah.
[9:58] Robe him, clothe him.
[10:02] Amen. And put a ring on his finger on
[10:05] his hand and shoes on his feet. Praise
[10:09] the Lord. And bring either the fatted
[10:11] calf and kill. And let us eat and be
[10:13] merry. For this my son was dead and is
[10:16] alive again. He was lost and is found.
[10:19] And they began to be merry. Hallelujah.
[10:22] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[10:25] Amen.
[10:26] Now, I'm saying that the father has an
[10:28] appointed time for us.
[10:31] Amen. We may have been around in the the
[10:35] the message or in the Christian life for
[10:37] many years, but the father has an
[10:39] appointed time for us. Even tonight
[10:42] could be your appointed time. Amen.
[10:44] Where God is going to do something in
[10:46] your life and turn you around. God can
[10:49] change your life around tonight and set
[10:51] you on fire for him. Amen. Amen.
[10:53] Hallelujah.
[10:55] If there's ministers here, God can stir
[10:57] up that gift within you. If there's song
[10:59] leaders in here, God can stir up that
[11:01] gift within you. If there's a gift
[11:02] within you, God can stir it up even
[11:04] tonight.
[11:07] Amen. Thank you, Sister Mika, for that
[11:09] song. I appreciated it. Amen.
[11:10] Hallelujah. You have a gift on your
[11:12] life. You have an anointing on your
[11:13] life. Amen. And just preserve it and
[11:15] keep nurturing it. Hallelujah. Praise
[11:18] the Lord. Amen. Amen. And brother show
[11:22] and you keep encouraging it. Hallelujah.
[11:25] Now watch. God will do things in times
[11:28] stages. He could have sent the message
[11:31] with the seven seals in 1947
[11:34] but he didn't send it. There was a time
[11:37] appointed of the father. Amen.
[11:40] Hallelujah. So let's read this now in
[11:43] quote number one in desperations. This
[11:44] is preached 1963. Listen to what he
[11:46] says. He says, "And all the things that
[11:49] he hasn't done through the ages in the
[11:52] church ages, he's doing now."
[11:56] Do you see now? Straight away, he's
[11:58] showing you there were things that were
[11:59] appointed by the father for a certain
[12:01] time. He didn't do it down through the
[12:03] church ages. He's doing it
[12:06] now. Back to the word
[12:10] because the messenger the messages and
[12:14] messages and messages
[12:17] How many messages did he bring? Can you
[12:19] hear how he's breaking it
[12:21] down? Because how many messages is he
[12:24] saying there? Three. He's saying because
[12:28] the messages and messages and the
[12:31] messages has to wind up in the entire
[12:34] word. Amen. And in the last days, the
[12:38] seven seals being opened up was to pick
[12:40] up every straggle that's been left off
[12:42] in it and make the whole thing in one
[12:45] great big body of the bride.
[12:48] That them who live back there was,
[12:51] listen to what he's saying now. Follow
[12:52] his thought. them who live back there 7
[12:55] through seven church ages was not
[12:57] perfect until this church. Amen.
[13:02] Hallelujah. Be perfected.
[13:07] The time appointed of the father.
[13:10] Which means the first one coming to
[13:12] perfection is you. He's just telling you
[13:15] there they were not perfect and they
[13:18] can't be perfect until this church.
[13:22] Amen. be perfected this bride group in
[13:27] the last days to bring them in. Oh,
[13:30] hallelujah.
[13:32] Amen. Hallelujah.
[13:34] Thank you, Lord.
[13:38] Do you see what an important role we
[13:40] have? Do you see why it's important for
[13:42] us to mature? You see why it's important
[13:45] for us to get into our position? Praise
[13:48] the Lord. because he's saying this
[13:50] bridegroom in the last days to bring
[13:52] them in and all together be taken up.
[13:55] See?
[13:59] So, it's only going to happen up at the
[14:01] headstone to sweep the rest of them up.
[14:05] Praise the Lord.
[14:07] Amen. You can go and read that. It's
[14:10] it's in desperations. Beautiful quote.
[14:12] Amen. Praise the Lord. Ecclesiastes 3
[14:15] and1. to everything. There is a season.
[14:21] There was a season for you to receive
[14:22] the word. There was a season for you to
[14:25] grow in the word. Amen. There was a
[14:28] season for you to question the word for
[14:30] to get understanding of the word. There
[14:32] was a question for you to settle all
[14:34] your doubts. A time for you to settle
[14:36] all your doubts. A season for it. And a
[14:38] time to every purpose under the heaven.
[14:42] Praise the Lord.
[14:45] Now there's a time for every purpose
[14:47] under the heaven is because the type of
[14:50] person that we are expected to be in
[14:52] this time and season is only going to
[14:54] come through trials and testings.
[14:59] Sunday we speaking on divine nature.
[15:02] We're moving into divine character
[15:04] and nobody can come here in this line
[15:06] here and tell me pray for my
[15:10] character. Lord give me good character.
[15:13] Lord, I want character is molded.
[15:17] Hallelujah. It's shaped
[15:19] through life experiences.
[15:21] You know who doesn't like that?
[15:23] Rebellious people. Rebellious people
[15:26] when the Lord is trying to work doesn't
[15:28] want no I don't want this kind of
[15:29] molding.
[15:32] Moses could have said
[15:35] that. I'm comfortable here in my palace.
[15:38] Why you want to mold me and shape me
[15:39] this way? Character cannot be imparted
[15:42] via prayer.
[15:46] Character takes a molding.
[15:49] Character takes a beating.
[15:52] Until pure gold is coming out.
[15:57] Praise the
[15:58] Lord. So there's a season for something.
[16:01] There's a there's a time for every
[16:02] purpose under the heaven. God knows what
[16:05] he's doing. Why don't we trust the
[16:07] process? Amen.
[16:11] Amen. Now, we we we speaking about Moses
[16:15] and he was a mighty anointed prophet.
[16:18] Amen. And he was born at the right time
[16:20] to deliver them. But you see, it wasn't
[16:23] God's appointed time when he slew the
[16:26] Egyptian. He moved ahead of God's
[16:29] program. He slew the Egyptian.
[16:31] God still had had another 40 years in
[16:34] his timeline,
[16:37] but he went
[16:38] ahead. Hallelujah.
[16:41] And when you're moving out of God's
[16:42] timeline, fear will strike you.
[16:46] Because when we are moving in God's
[16:48] timeline, we stand here fearless. Amen.
[16:51] We stand here powerful. We stand here
[16:54] commissioned. We are not going to move
[16:56] our ground. We stand here knowing this
[16:59] is the time appointed of the father.
[17:01] People can tell us back down. People can
[17:04] tell us go back. We are saying no. We
[17:06] are moving forward. Amen. Hallelujah. So
[17:10] what happened? Fear drove him to the
[17:11] wilderness.
[17:13] But God had another appointed time for
[17:15] Moses. God had set it up. So look, Moses
[17:18] coming into the wilderness. I'm going to
[17:20] attract his attention. I'm going to make
[17:22] him associate with the supernatural.
[17:27] Hallelujah. So even in our wilderness
[17:29] journeys, God is not leaving us, but
[17:32] he's got the supernatural there to meet
[17:35] us.
[17:37] He's got a burning bush to attract our
[17:39] attention. He's got something to catch
[17:42] our attention. Amen. Moses had just left
[17:44] the most powerful kingdom, but he had
[17:47] never seen a bush like this. Amen. He
[17:49] had never seen a presence like this. And
[17:51] he never heard a voice like this that
[17:53] told him the ground that you are
[17:55] standing upon now is holy ground. He had
[17:58] been in the presence of Pharaoh. He knew
[18:00] some kind of reverence. But this was a
[18:02] different kind of a reverence. This was
[18:04] the presence of almighty God.
[18:12] Now even tonight we've got to recognize
[18:14] the presence of God.
[18:17] Praise the Lord. This was a different
[18:19] kind of a presence he was in. He took
[18:21] off his shoes
[18:23] and he bowed down before this. He did.
[18:26] And who was that? Go read it. It was the
[18:29] angel of the Lord in the burning bush.
[18:35] The one that was sent for every Exodus.
[18:40] That same one is here tonight. That same
[18:43] one is here tonight. That same one is
[18:45] here. Amen. For you. This is the time
[18:48] appointed of the father for you to
[18:50] connect with him. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[18:54] Amen.
[18:55] So God had set this up. Flee to the
[18:58] wilderness, but I'll let you meet my
[19:00] presence.
[19:02] So I'm telling you, our father is so I
[19:05] can't even describe him. Even in desert
[19:08] places, he meets us there. He equips us
[19:11] there. He strips us of all our Egyptian
[19:14] ways. He strips us of all our latest
[19:16] ways. He strips us of all our worldly
[19:18] ways. And he equips us with his word.
[19:24] Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, if we if we
[19:28] get to that quote there, why did God
[19:31] allow Moses to stay in the wilderness of
[19:33] 40 years? Here what he says. Let's move
[19:35] past this.
[19:37] Amen. Yeah. Let's stop here. God called
[19:40] Moses to the wilderness. Here what he
[19:42] says.
[19:45] The waiting was not on Moses' part, but
[19:49] because the people who were not ready to
[19:51] receive
[19:54] him. You remember a while ago I told you
[19:56] that the the people are not ready for
[19:58] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[20:01] They don't know how to cope with
[20:03] it. In fact, there's so much of
[20:09] impersonation. Amen. that the
[20:12] impersonation looks more
[20:14] glamorous. So they would rather go for
[20:16] that. They are not ready for the
[20:18] manifestation of the sons of God. Amen.
[20:22] Because of Janice and Jamus. Amen. But
[20:25] look, the people were not ready to
[20:26] receive him. Moses thought the people
[20:29] would understand but they did
[20:33] not. Amen. We can drop down a bit there.
[20:37] I want to get now after he says remember
[20:40] God had started Israel as a virgin with
[20:42] his word but they wanted something
[20:44] different. So did the last day church.
[20:47] God did not move Israel or let her go
[20:50] into the promised land until it was his
[20:52] own appointed time.
[20:56] So even in our own lives, you trusting
[20:59] the Lord for something. You're believing
[21:01] the Lord for something.
[21:04] We've got to wait for the appointed
[21:06] time. Amen.
[21:08] Praise the Lord. If we move ahead of
[21:11] time, ahead of season, we'll be in God's
[21:13] permissive will. But Moses had to wait
[21:16] in the wilderness for 40 years for the
[21:19] appointed time of the father. Brother
[21:21] Brandham had to preach from
[21:23] 1947 right until
[21:26] 1963, waiting for the appointed time of
[21:28] the father. He said, "The message I've
[21:30] waited for all my life." Praise the
[21:33] Lord.
[21:35] Now he says even Joshua, Joshua was
[21:38] given a commission to place them in the
[21:40] land. And he says the people were
[21:42] putting pressure on him. And listen now
[21:44] he says the people now I want you to
[21:46] understand what we are reading
[21:51] here is a hidden mystery.
[21:56] The portion that we are reading is from
[21:58] pick up your pen and
[22:01] write. Right. Let me tie this for you.
[22:04] In Revelation 10, John is told not to
[22:12] write. I'll say it this way. What John
[22:15] was told not to write,
[22:22] you pick it up. I'm not going to say it.
[22:26] A prophet was told, "Pick up your pen
[22:30] and
[22:31] write. Hallelujah.
[22:35] Because it's a hidden mystery.
[22:40] Amen. You caught it.
[22:42] What John was told not to
[22:45] write, the prophet was told, pick up
[22:47] your pen and write.
[22:51] Because this thing is packed.
[22:55] So I'm saying we are we have what we are
[22:56] reading here now is that the people put
[22:58] pressure on Joshua the leader. The land
[23:00] is ours. Let's go take it. Now, don't we
[23:02] also say that this belongs to us. This
[23:05] belongs to us. This belongs to us. Let's
[23:07] go take it. But never forget Exodus 23
[23:10] when he says, "Little by little, I'll
[23:12] release it to you so that you're not
[23:15] overtaken by the beast of the field."
[23:20] So that's why we've been speaking. We're
[23:22] moving into higher dimensions of the
[23:24] Holy Ghost and moving little by little.
[23:26] Amen. And we are fighting and overcoming
[23:29] and overtaking. Amen. Gaining
[23:32] ground. He says, "The land is yours.
[23:35] Let's go take it." Joshua, you are all
[23:36] through. You must have lost your
[23:38] commission. You don't have the power you
[23:40] used to have. You see how they
[23:42] talk? You used to hear from God and know
[23:45] the will of God and act quickly.
[23:46] Something is wrong with you. But Joshua
[23:48] was a God-scent prophet. He knew the
[23:50] promises of God. So, he waited for them.
[23:54] He waited for a clear-cut decision from
[23:56] God. When the time came to move, God
[23:59] placed the full leadership in Joshua's
[24:01] hands because he stayed with the word.
[24:04] God could trust Joshua but not the
[24:06] others. Now remember, who is Joshua
[24:08] there? He's trying to bring a reference
[24:11] to himself.
[24:13] God could trust Joshua but not the
[24:15] others. Amen.
[24:18] And he says, "So it will repeat in this
[24:21] day the same problem, the same
[24:25] pressures." Amen. Praise the
[24:28] Lord. Even John the Baptist, John the
[24:31] Baptist went into the wilderness, but at
[24:33] the time appointed of the father, he
[24:35] comes out crying.
[24:38] Amen. He comes, Amen. Repent. Prepare ye
[24:42] the way of the Lord.
[24:45] The Messiah is at hand. We think quickly
[24:49] now about Esther. Esther is there in the
[24:52] kingdom, but it's not yet the appointed
[24:55] time of the father.
[24:58] Praise the Lord.
[25:01] There comes a specific
[25:03] time and these are the words that Modi
[25:05] said to her. Think not to with thyself
[25:08] that thou shalt escape in the king's
[25:09] house more than all the Jews. For if
[25:12] thou allto together oldest thy peace at
[25:14] this time, they there shall their
[25:17] enlargement and deliverance arise to the
[25:20] Jews from another place. But thou and
[25:22] thy fathers, thou shalt be destroyed,
[25:24] and who knoweth whether thou would come
[25:25] to the kingdom for such a time as
[25:29] this? In other words, he was telling
[25:31] her, "This is now the appointed time.
[25:35] You've lived in the queen as a queen for
[25:37] too long.
[25:40] You've lived in the
[25:43] palace, but now is the appointed time
[25:46] for you to move into another role.
[25:50] Praise the Lord.
[25:52] Because more uh King Azerus didn't marry
[25:56] her just for her
[25:59] beauty. Praise the Lord. He wanted
[26:01] intimacy with Esther.
[26:05] Praise the Lord.
[26:10] So, I want to get to Ephesians 15 there.
[26:12] Amen. Let's just read Ephesians
[26:17] 15, but we'll read from 14 there. Just
[26:20] take it up one. Yeah, leave it there.
[26:23] Now, listen what the what the Apostle
[26:25] Paul is writing. He says, "According as
[26:28] he hath chosen us,
[26:35] Hallelujah.
[26:38] I want you I want that to sober in the
[26:41] one who created the heavens and the
[26:42] earth.
[26:45] The one who is king of kings and lord of
[26:46] lords.
[26:50] The one who with just one word he could
[26:52] end the entire thing.
[26:57] God
[26:58] almighty. Not a god. Amen. The god.
[27:02] Amen. God Almighty hath chosen us.
[27:08] Tell your neighbor, I am chosen by God.
[27:13] Hallelujah.
[27:15] You know, if you were chosen by the
[27:17] president, it might be an
[27:19] honor. If you were chosen by some uh uh
[27:23] renowned person of this world, we
[27:25] consider it an honor. Even when you're
[27:27] playing sports and you're selecting
[27:29] teams, the captain choose you. You feel
[27:32] so proud. If he call you last, you're
[27:35] not so
[27:40] proud. But God
[27:43] had chosen us.
[27:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[27:48] Let me also say this. We were not
[27:50] deserving.
[27:51] We were not worthy for it. But God
[27:54] looked past our faults.
[27:56] He looked beyond my faults and saw my
[28:01] needs.
[28:03] Amen. He knew me
[28:06] yet he loved me.
[28:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He had chosen
[28:12] us. And when he chooses us, he doesn't
[28:16] choose us to lose us. Amen. Amen. God
[28:19] doesn't choose us to lose us. And
[28:22] neither does he choose us for us to be
[28:23] losers. Amen. God has chosen us to be
[28:26] winners. God has chosen us to be people
[28:29] of purpose. God has chosen us for his
[28:31] kingdom for such a time as this. God has
[28:33] chosen us to be sons and daughters of
[28:35] God that will carry out his kingdom
[28:37] mandate on the earth.
[28:40] Praise the Lord. I I can just read that
[28:42] like for for another time and say he had
[28:45] chosen us.
[28:47] He had chosen us. Hallelujah. There were
[28:50] so many others
[28:53] that he might have chosen
[28:56] to follow him.
[28:59] Others were
[29:00] learning and great. You know the song to
[29:04] the show to great distinctions to follow
[29:09] him. Men with
[29:11] authority and forceful ability
[29:16] to know how to
[29:21] Amen. It says, "I don't know. I don't
[29:24] know but why, but he chose me to follow
[29:26] him."
[29:28] I love you, Lord. He chose us. You know,
[29:31] you know what that is? We read with
[29:34] would marvel and we see he chose
[29:36] Peter and now he selected John and now
[29:40] he selected Matthew.
[29:42] But then he come in this time.
[29:47] What year was it?
[29:52] 2007 he came to you
[29:55] and he said follow me few years earlier
[29:58] he said follow
[30:00] me if they had to write about our
[30:02] stories
[30:04] it would be written of us when you came
[30:06] in brother
[30:07] Romesh
[30:09] 85 1985 God chose brother
[30:15] Romesh there were so many others
[30:18] is that he might have chosen.
[30:22] Why not choose JF Rollins?
[30:27] Amen. Why not choose somebody else?
[30:31] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Praise the
[30:34] Lord. And when did he choose us?
[30:40] He didn't choose us. Now, he didn't
[30:42] choose us based on our own merit.
[30:44] Amen. The Bible says here, he chose us
[30:48] before the foundation of the world.
[30:52] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[30:54] Lord.
[30:59] Before the foundation of the world. So
[31:02] before he said, "Let there be light." Oh
[31:04] yes. He chose us. Amen.
[31:08] When he was saying let there be light,
[31:10] he was trying to create a world so that
[31:12] we who he chose could come and live in.
[31:18] So whatever you are seeing in Genesis 1
[31:20] is a result of because he chose us.
[31:25] So now this great God who chose us is a
[31:27] father who will take care of us. So he's
[31:29] going to provide an environment for us
[31:31] to live.
[31:35] So he creates the heavens and the earth.
[31:40] Right? That we should be holy and
[31:43] without blame before him in love. Now
[31:47] nothing can change that. Amen. Read it
[31:50] again. He chose us that we should be
[31:53] holy and without blame. I don't care how
[31:56] many prosecutors you got against you. I
[31:59] don't care if the devil and his armies
[32:00] can come against you. He chose you to be
[32:02] holy.
[32:04] Thank you, Lord. He chose you to be
[32:06] holy. I said he chose you to be holy. No
[32:10] matter of sin can make you unholy
[32:12] because he chose you to be holy.
[32:18] And no matter I was guilty. Hey, feel
[32:22] like singing tonight. Guilty.
[32:25] But Jesus dropped the charges.
[32:29] Amen. We should be holy. Now, now I
[32:33] thought I thought the angels sing about
[32:36] somebody holy, holy,
[32:39] holy. But little messiahs
[32:42] are just like their father. And he chose
[32:45] us to be holy like he is holy.
[32:50] He chose us to be holy.
[32:53] And without blame. Amen. Amen. So no
[32:56] matter what we've done, he came to
[32:59] justify us without blame before him
[33:02] where
[33:03] in the capstone in the headstone. Amen.
[33:07] That's the only place. Why? We just read
[33:10] the quote. It takes up up there to bring
[33:12] the rest of them to perfection. So we
[33:15] were called to be holy in this appointed
[33:17] time of the father. We were called to be
[33:19] blameless in this appointed time of the
[33:21] father at the time of the coming of the
[33:23] headstone.
[33:26] Thank you Lord. This is the time
[33:28] appointed of the father. Amen.
[33:33] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[33:37] Having predestinated us unto the
[33:39] adoption of children. He's showing us
[33:41] how it's going to come now.
[33:43] You are my child.
[33:46] Adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[33:48] himself according to the good pleasure
[33:50] of his will. Amen. So all of the other
[33:54] stages were only stations. The prophet
[33:57] calls it just stations. A station is not
[34:00] your destination.
[34:02] Come on.
[34:04] Your station is not your destination.
[34:07] Amen. Amen. So being coming into the to
[34:11] the church was a was a station. Coming
[34:14] into the bride was a station. Coming as
[34:16] a wife was a station. But the
[34:19] predestination was to be adopted
[34:21] children of God.
[34:25] Amen.
[34:27] Praise the Lord.
[34:30] Amen. Now, God has times appointed of
[34:33] the father and he has certain scriptures
[34:36] locked in there to call you out for this
[34:38] appointed time. So, he put in there
[34:40] Revelation 10:7. He says there in the
[34:42] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[34:44] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[34:46] of God should be finished as he had
[34:49] declared to his servant the prophets.
[34:51] And then it goes into verse 8 to 11. And
[34:54] you know that is our appointed time
[34:56] right now.
[34:57] Nobody else could fulfill that
[34:59] scripture. Not even John who was caught
[35:02] up in the vision could fulfill that
[35:03] scripture. John was typing an end time
[35:06] people.
[35:12] Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so glad that
[35:15] I'm caught up in the appointed time of
[35:17] the father. Amen. I'm not caught up in
[35:19] somebody else's ministry, but I'm caught
[35:22] up in my own ministry right here on the
[35:24] earth. I'm called to be a witness. I'm
[35:27] called to prophesy again. I'm called to
[35:29] testify again.
[35:31] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Oh, glory
[35:35] be to his name. Romans 8. This is now
[35:38] what we are talking about. This is the
[35:40] appointed time of the father. You may
[35:42] see it in its infancy. You may see it
[35:44] growing right now. But I tell you,
[35:46] people are not convinced about the
[35:48] urgency of the hour. I believe
[35:52] there's a song third Exodus sings the
[35:54] urgency of the hour. People are not
[35:56] convinced the urgency of the hour. They
[35:58] can see a pope come out of the United
[36:00] States. There's no urgency of the hour.
[36:02] They can see the bride coming into
[36:03] position. There's no urgency of the
[36:05] hour. They can see Trump moving as a key
[36:08] player where all the nations of the
[36:10] world. Even our president is probably
[36:11] talking to him right now. Amen. And if
[36:13] you heard his words, he's so he's so
[36:16] focused on what kind of a deal he can do
[36:17] as if his entire hopes rest on that.
[36:22] And if you know the
[36:24] history would never bow to the United
[36:27] States. They were always opposing them.
[36:30] They said that's one thing we will never
[36:31] do. Bow to the United States. And here
[36:33] he is today bowing to the United States.
[36:40] Praise the Lord.
[36:43] What did it their downfall?
[36:46] Touch not my anointed.
[36:48] You who bless Israel will be blessed.
[36:51] You who curse Israel will be cursed.
[36:55] Praise the Lord. But I'm so glad I'm
[36:58] living in an economy within an economy.
[37:01] Hallelujah.
[37:03] Amen. My economy is God's economy. Amen.
[37:08] My currency is not rand. My currency is
[37:10] faith. And I've got something to
[37:13] generate this kind. They print money.
[37:16] I've got something that generates faith.
[37:19] And faith cometh by the hearing of the
[37:21] word. So I become a faith millionaire. I
[37:25] become a faith billionaire by the word
[37:27] that's generating this faith in me.
[37:31] Amen.
[37:32] So go and tell everyone you're a
[37:34] millionaire.
[37:36] Tell everyone you're a billionaire.
[37:38] Hallelujah.
[37:41] Confuse them with your language. You're
[37:43] a faith Christian. You believe the word
[37:46] of God.
[37:48] Amen. So no matter where you are in this
[37:52] life, remember God has predestinated to
[37:55] be holy. Amen. So when God looks at you,
[37:58] even when you are feeling down and out,
[38:00] God is looking at you as holy. God is
[38:04] looking at you as blameless. Hallelujah.
[38:08] Now notice how we beat oursel up over
[38:11] our
[38:15] past. How we beat ourself up over our
[38:18] past. But here now he says the earnest
[38:22] expectation of the creature waited for
[38:24] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[38:29] For we know that the whole creation
[38:31] groanth and travail in pain together
[38:33] until now. Amen. And not only they but
[38:36] ourselves also which have the first
[38:38] fruits of the spirit. Even we ourselves
[38:41] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[38:44] adoption to wit the redemption of our
[38:46] body. Hallelujah.
[38:48] These bodies are going to be changed.
[38:51] I'm asking you, are you ready for the
[38:53] translation?
[38:57] With all the signs that are around us,
[39:00] with all the signs that are around us,
[39:02] it's the end time. Amen. The gentile
[39:05] doors will still soon be closed.
[39:08] I'm asking you, are you ready for the
[39:10] return of the Lord Jesus Christ? I'm not
[39:13] talking about the 1963 coming. I'm
[39:15] asking you, are you ready for the return
[39:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[39:21] Hallelujah.
[39:28] You see the response brother Sunny gave.
[39:30] Come quickly.
[39:33] That's found in Revelation 22. It says,
[39:35] "Even
[39:37] so, come Lord Jesus. Come quickly."
[39:41] Right? Can I tell you why?
[39:45] Why is that found in the end
[39:51] there? Amen. How many of you ready for
[39:54] some truth?
[39:57] You can find the scripture. Put it up.
[39:59] Amen. Praise the Lord. I want to pray.
[40:02] So, let's just get to this. Amen.
[40:14] In verse
[40:21] 17, Amen. It says, "The spirit and the
[40:30] bride." That's not two people
[40:36] because the spirit is in the bride.
[40:42] Hello. The spirit and the bride. You see
[40:46] the language is confusing because the
[40:49] father of our Lord Jesus
[40:51] Christ.
[40:54] Hey, did he not say it'll be Christ in
[40:57] bride form? The spirit will be in the
[41:00] bride.
[41:02] Hallelujah.
[41:05] The spirit and the bride say come. This
[41:08] is Bible now. And let him that heareth
[41:11] say come. And let him that is a thirst
[41:14] come. And whosoever will let him take of
[41:17] the water of life freely.
[41:21] Amen. Then let's drop
[41:24] to 20. He which testify these things
[41:28] saith, surely I come
[41:31] quickly. Amen. Now John says, "Amen.
[41:35] Even so come Lord Jesus."
[41:43] Now pay attention. He's answering
[41:46] something. Somebody is saying, "Behold,
[41:48] I come
[41:52] quickly." Okay, let me tie it for you.
[41:54] Genesis, he comes in the cool of the day
[41:58] to meet with
[41:59] Adam. And there's a Adam there always to
[42:02] receive
[42:04] him. But there comes a certain
[42:06] day
[42:08] when the one who is saying I come
[42:10] quickly is coming into the
[42:14] garden and Adam can't answer the same
[42:16] way when he says Adam where art thou I'm
[42:20] coming
[42:21] quickly. Adam is nowhere to be found.
[42:25] But when Adam is restored in the end
[42:27] time,
[42:29] oh, come on.
[42:32] God is showing you that in Genesis 3,
[42:36] man
[42:37] fell and he couldn't answer the call of
[42:40] God.
[42:42] Here, when man is fully redeemed and
[42:44] restored, there's a man on the earth who
[42:47] can answer the call of God. Amen.
[42:51] A redeemed man,
[42:54] a Adam man back on the earth, that can
[42:56] now answer father's voice and not say,
[42:59] "I heard your voice in the garden and I
[43:01] hid." Now he's saying, "I'm clothed."
[43:06] Come on. Now it's the end time. The
[43:08] father is saying, "Behold, I come
[43:09] quickly, Adam." And Adam on the earth is
[43:12] now saying, "Even so, come. I'm ready.
[43:16] I'm back in my original condition. I'm
[43:18] back in my original position. Amen.
[43:20] Because the spirit that my original
[43:22] spirit, go back to that verse. Amen.
[43:25] Hallelujah. 17. The original spirit
[43:28] which Adam lost is now back in her.
[43:30] Amen. Is now back in the people. Thank
[43:32] you, Lord. That's what's making her say
[43:34] come. Because the inheritance that she
[43:36] lost
[43:40] has come back.
[43:45] the spirit in the brain. Adam lost the
[43:48] Holy Ghost. Adam lost his original
[43:50] spirit. So now that the original spirit
[43:53] has come back into man, the word fully
[43:56] restored, this is how the book of
[43:58] Revelation ends
[44:00] with a call from God.
[44:04] One call in Genesis, he couldn't answer,
[44:06] but here when he's fully restored, he
[44:08] can answer the call. And he says, "Come,
[44:12] Lord Jesus." Amen. Let's stand together.
[44:15] Give God praise.
[44:20] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[44:24] Glory be to his name. Amen. Thank you,
[44:26] Lord. Hallelujah.
[44:29] Amen.
[44:30] Hallelujah.
[44:32] You know the scriptur is always written
[44:33] like
[44:34] that. Peace be unto you and
[44:37] grace. Amen. From the father and the
[44:40] lord Jesus Christ. Now people would
[44:43] think that's true but it's one. So he
[44:46] says the spirit and the bride are saying
[44:48] come.
[44:50] So the spirit becomes so united with
[44:54] you. You can't tell it apart.
[44:59] Praise the
[45:00] Lord. Glory be to his name. Let's sing
[45:03] and glorify his name. Let's sing that
[45:06] song. Even so come Lord Jesus come.
