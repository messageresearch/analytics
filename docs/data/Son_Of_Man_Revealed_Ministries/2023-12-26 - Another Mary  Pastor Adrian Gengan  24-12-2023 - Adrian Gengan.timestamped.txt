[3:55] Lord
[3:57] yes we'll read from verse 2
[4:02] 6 and in the sixth month the angel
[4:05] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of
[4:08] Galilee named
[4:10] Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man
[4:14] whose name was Joseph of the House of
[4:16] David and the virgin's name was
[4:20] Mary and the angel came in unto her and
[4:23] said hail Thou Art highly favored the
[4:26] Lord is with thee blessed are thou among
[4:29] women am amen amen so God had a specific
[4:33] woman in mind amen so just remember you
[4:37] are another Mary now and when she saw
[4:40] him she was troubled at his saying and
[4:42] cast in her mind what manner of
[4:44] salutation this should be and the angel
[4:47] said unto her fear not Mary for thou has
[4:50] found favor with God and behold thou sh
[4:53] conceive in thy womb and bring forth a
[4:55] son and shall call his name Jesus amen
[4:59] amen hallelujah I want you to know right
[5:02] after the birth day amen that we the
[5:03] Mary of this day must reproduce The Life
[5:06] of Christ and we must bring forth Jesus
[5:08] in our lives amen and he shall be great
[5:11] and shall be called the son of the
[5:13] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[5:15] him the Throne of his father David and
[5:18] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[5:19] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[5:22] be no end then said Mary unto the angel
[5:25] how shall this be seeing I know not a
[5:28] man and the the angel answered and said
[5:30] unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon
[5:33] thee oh aren't we glad for the Holy
[5:35] Ghost amen praise the lord it's the work
[5:39] of the holy spirit amen and the power of
[5:41] the highest shall overshadow thee and
[5:44] therefore also that Holy thing which
[5:47] shall be born of thee shall be called
[5:49] The Son of God if we are to produce the
[5:51] Life of Christ the key is the Holy Ghost
[5:54] right he's going to bring it to pass
[5:56] he's going to overshadow us amen amen

[6:24] baby that needs to be resurrected to
[6:26] life hallah to us whom the Revelation

[6:50] mouths closed and zipped amen but before
[6:54] we go on in our message amen I just want
[6:55] to go and go and go amen but I just want
[6:58] to have an announcement amen so amen it
[7:01] was with sadness in our hearts that we
[7:03] amen heard about the passing of our dear
[7:05] sister
[7:06] baby amen so we'd like to pass our
[7:09] condolences to brother Clive Amen
[7:11] brother Caleb's not here this morning
[7:13] amen and you know brother jaff and
[7:15] sister Kim macius amen so we pray that
[7:17] the Lord will be with him amen I haven't
[7:19] received the official uh funeral notice
[7:22] but from what I heard amen the funeral
[7:24] will be on Wednesday amen at the betesda
[7:28] the old betesda min Street if you
[7:30] remember the old church is that right
[7:32] brother CLI amen so if you know EJ mle's
[7:35] old
[7:36] church you know the old
[7:38] church in clayfield yeah amen so I
[7:41] believe it's starting at 10:00 a.m. once
[7:43] the official notification comes out we
[7:45] will forward it to you amen
[7:48] now it's important for us to honor the
[7:50] memory of sister baby because she was a
[7:52] member of the church amen amen you would
[7:55] remember she was a faithful member she's
[7:57] one of the earliest Believers in the
[7:58] church so she has been with the church
[8:00] for over 40 something
[8:02] years amen
[8:04] hallelujah and I'm sure many of you
[8:06] share many memories with her you'll
[8:09] remember having experiences with her
[8:11] having conversations with her but she
[8:13] was a mighty woman of
[8:16] Faith amen amen and she served the Lord
[8:22] Faithfully not a Troublesome
[8:25] sister a very quiet sister but just come
[8:28] and take in the word of the Lord amen
[8:31] and and we all know that at I think was
[8:33] it 2 or 3 years of age Amen brother
[8:36] Caleb was put into her care and she
[8:38] raised brother Caleb as one of her own
[8:41] Amen brother C would remember amen our
[8:43] mom used to bring her to church amen a
[8:46] faithful woman of God yes amen and bring
[8:50] all the children to church and fulfill a
[8:54] duty as The Fifth Gospel and train the
[8:56] children up in the ways of the Lord amen
[8:58] teach teach them the way they should go
[9:01] under the revelation of this end time
[9:03] message amen and in all these years I
[9:06] was trying to remember I can't remember
[9:08] a single time sister baby gave us a
[9:10] complaint or a trouble or a murmur or a
[9:14] groan amen hallelujah some of you that
[9:18] remember from the early days amen would
[9:20] testify to what I am saying amen so she
[9:23] she was a mother to us how old was mom
[9:25] when she passed was
[9:27] 80 exactly
[9:30] she would have been 81 amen now the
[9:32] Bible says and to everyone is given
[9:34] three score and 10 and if by virtue of
[9:37] Grace then 80 amen so we see she had
[9:40] extended Grace upon her life amen
[9:43] hallelujah and that is just the grace
[9:45] and favor of the Lord amen amen so even
[9:48] as we know our dear sister is rejoicing
[9:50] in glory a life didn't end in a feeble
[9:52] old body right her life ended
[9:55] victoriously because she entered a
[9:56] glorified body and Satan was defeated
[9:59] yes sir because she had the Lord Jesus
[10:02] Christ as a lord and savior amen so
[10:04] Satan couldn't hold that Soul Bound in
[10:06] hell right but she stepped into a
[10:09] glorified body in a young body in the
[10:11] Brilliance of her youth amen amen amen
[10:15] the prophet says between 18 and 21 the
[10:18] prophet says when he went over on the
[10:19] other side he saw the most beautiful
[10:21] young woman coming running towards him
[10:24] with flowing gowns with long haired amen
[10:27] and they came and greeted him our
[10:28] precious brother amen amen now believe
[10:31] our sister before she passed amen a
[10:35] daughter Sister Jenny had the message of
[10:37] the hour The Prophet's voice playing for
[10:39] her amen and I believe she passed with
[10:42] that tape playing amen amen and it's
[10:44] always a beautiful thing because it's a
[10:46] thought to consider could it be that the
[10:49] last voice she heard here on Earth is
[10:50] the first voice she hears on the other
[10:53] sideen amen hallelujah amen you know
[10:57] these things we preach is a reality amen
[10:59] there is another dimension right amen
[11:02] death is not the end you enter a body
[11:05] amen for those of you that believe on
[11:06] the Lord Jesus Christ have accepted him
[11:08] have confessed him with your mouth and
[11:10] believe him in your heart amen
[11:12] hallelujah accept to this glorious truth
[11:14] of the end time for the opening of the
[11:16] word the revelation of the Seven Seals
[11:18] amen the revelation of the seven
[11:19] Thunders to awaken us amen amen GL then
[11:23] we are not miserable people amen I know
[11:26] sometimes you yourself your character is
[11:28] a miserable one and and you can't get
[11:30] along with yourself brother brandom says
[11:32] amen but how about you put a smile now
[11:35] you in the presence of other people amen
[11:37] hallelujah say I want to get beside
[11:39] myself amen amen amen yes sir amen so
[11:44] amen so we have very fond and pleasant
[11:46] memories of sister baby amen and I want
[11:50] you to know that was the last time
[11:51] you'll see a sick feeble or old yeah one
[11:54] of these days when the resurrection of
[11:56] the Dead comes forth you'll see her in
[11:58] the BR of her youth am hallelujah amen
[12:02] hallelujah praise the Lord you know I
[12:04] remember she was here in
[12:06] April and
[12:08] uh you know they told her she had
[12:10] Alzheimer's and she was losing her
[12:12] memory and couldn't remember much things
[12:14] but maybe it's the grace of the Lord but
[12:17] when she came here she remembered
[12:19] everything she said she said to me this
[12:21] is my

[12:56] problems but you know what brother Clive
[12:58] she always remembered her children in
[13:00] prayer she always had a desire for them

[15:05] after the service I don't want any of
[15:06] you to rush off even our visitors you're
[15:08] welcome to join us for a meal amen
[15:11] praise the Lord and we give thanks to
[15:13] the Lord
[15:15] amen so we don't want to be Pharisees
[15:19] right Jesus rebuked the Pharisees amen
[15:22] now there's nobody can lie to us or
[15:24] deceive us into telling us that Jesus
[15:26] was born on the 25th of December 100%
[15:29] amen anybody believe Jesus was born 25th
[15:32] of
[15:33] December nobody okay but we also mustn't
[15:37] be hypocritical right yes we can't say
[15:41] we don't celebrate Christmas and then we
[15:43] do things that because if tomorrow is a
[15:46] Monday and you normally eat vegetable on
[15:47] a Monday that's what you should be
[15:51] eating right I hope you get what I'm
[15:53] saying amen amen because the Bible found
[15:57] it fit enough to record the birth of of
[15:58] Jesus
[16:00] Amen and it's quite detailed it's quite
[16:04] extensive I know it says that nowhere in
[16:06] the Bible it instructs us to wor to
[16:08] celebrate the birth of Jesus which is
[16:11] true but is it all the word of God that
[16:14] we want amen I ask you if you don't
[16:17] remember him at this time when in the
[16:20] year do you remember him truthfully now
[16:22] no FES when do you remember the birth
[16:26] because the Bible is extensive in and
[16:28] detailing the birth so you know the
[16:31] Jesus is telling us about how these
[16:33] Pharisees were saying we don't do any
[16:35] work on a Saturday on the Sabbath but
[16:38] yet the donkey fell in the ditch and
[16:39] they picked the donkey up so he says
[16:41] don't be an hypocrite he was plucking
[16:44] corn in the field
[16:46] so amen ask yourself what are you doing
[16:49] tomorrow if you're preparing turkey and
[16:51] you're preparing chicken and you're
[16:53] preparing a meal and you're preparing
[16:55] lamb what are you really remembering he
[16:58] is it a family day for you what is it
[17:01] but in all that you're doing I don't
[17:02] want you to be
[17:05] Hypocrites all right if you want to be
[17:07] truthful to the Lord and say Lord I
[17:09] prepare this mealia in remembrance of
[17:11] your birth even though it's not the
[17:13] right date then you rather be
[17:15] truthful amen I don't I don't I think we
[17:18] got some Hypocrites but I want everyone
[17:20] to be delivered here does everybody
[17:21] understand what I'm saying because like
[17:24] I said nobody can deceive us to tell us
[17:26] Jesus was born on the 25th of December
[17:28] amen we had a Vindicated Prophet who
[17:30] came and taught us these
[17:32] things amen amen so if you're going
[17:36] about your normal day and you're just
[17:37] doing nothing then it's
[17:40] fine
[17:42] right Hallelujah but praise the Lord
[17:46] amen so we reading here and why I'm
[17:49] drawing this contrast is because it's a
[17:51] good time to draw the
[17:52] contrast not to just focus on the birth
[17:55] and put him in a Manger December amen am
[18:00] amen but if you want to bring in present
[18:02] tense in 2023 then the word must be
[18:04] formed in you and me amen if that is not
[18:08] evident we are wasting our time yes sir
[18:11] amen we don't believe in abortions some
[18:14] ofth aborted the process of bringing
[18:16] forth the Life of Christ we don't
[18:19] believe in abortion yes so he was
[18:22] started a good work within you he's more
[18:24] than able to finish
[18:26] it amen hallelujah but you got to work
[18:29] with him you got to work with the Holy
[18:31] Spirit am amen
[18:34] hallelujah and we know amen the angel of
[18:36] God is amen hallelujah the holy spirit
[18:40] in the form of the angel of God and we
[18:43] find in every Exodus there was the angel
[18:45] of God
[18:46] moving yes yes yes amen when when when
[18:52] Moses saw the pillar of fire in the
[18:54] burning bush the Bible records it as the
[18:56] angel of the Lord in the burning bush
[18:58] amen go read your Bible
[19:01] again it's the angel of the Lord in the
[19:03] burning
[19:04] bush coming to talk to the first
[19:06] deliverer amen amen yes sir amen the
[19:10] same Angel of the Lord meets
[19:12] Mary amen
[19:14] amen oh yes Lord the angel didn't age
[19:18] Hallelujah the same angel now he has a
[19:21] sovereing
[19:22] thought the same holy ghost that raised
[19:26] up Jesus from the dead is in you and me
[19:28] amen can I get a witness here now
[19:30] Hallelujah yes Lord amen we Marvel at
[19:34] the life of Paul we Marvel at the life
[19:36] of all the Great Men of God but the same
[19:38] holy spirit that possessed their vessels
[19:40] and did great signs and wonders through
[19:42] their body is the same holy spirit that
[19:44] possessed you and
[19:46] me come on
[19:48] now yes sir the same holy spirit that
[19:51] was upon Peter that even the shadow
[19:53] healed the sick he the same Holy Spirit
[19:56] that's in you amen it's not in a
[19:58] weakened form the reason why amen you
[20:01] don't see the results is because you are
[20:03] not prepared to surrender your life to
[20:04] the holy spirit amen is everybody
[20:08] understanding what I'm saying the Holy
[20:10] Spirit doesn't come in measures of power
[20:12] amen the holy spirit is the same
[20:14] yesterday today and
[20:16] forever because the holy spirit is God
[20:19] that's right hallelujah amen and the
[20:21] Holy Spirit wants to do a work in you oh
[20:24] yes and in me amen the Holy Spirit now
[20:27] was sent to overshadow
[20:30] Mary thank you amen yes we find there
[20:35] now if you read in Revelation chapter 13
[20:37] he tells you that the people who won't
[20:39] be deceived are all those names that
[20:41] were written in the book and the lamb
[20:43] was slain before the foundation of the
[20:45] world yes sir now I ask you what need is
[20:48] there for God to have this in the back
[20:50] part of his mind that the lamb is slain
[20:52] before the foundation of the world if he
[20:54] didn't already have the thoughts of the

[34:55] speak amen even if you're crying
[34:58] speak You're a god of the Earth and the
[35:02] Earth responds to your voice that's
[35:06] right
[35:08] am thank you
[35:10] Lord how many if you have seen in the
[35:12] Bible God comes down on the earth and
[35:14] does things on the earth at his own will
[35:17] without the cooperation of man you show
[35:18] me
[35:19] amen show me in the Bible where God
[35:22] comes on the earth and does things on
[35:24] the earth without the operation of
[35:28] aen
[35:32] Hallelujah why God set a law in motion
[35:36] I'll make Adam in my image and he shall
[35:39] have dominion over the Earth Hallelujah
[35:41] so if God wants to do anything he
[35:43] doesn't violate his own law but he works
[35:47] himself in subjection to his own
[35:49] law that's why he has always been
[35:51] looking for men on the earth yes sir who
[35:56] would come in alignment with his plan
[35:58] amen when he couldn't find any man on
[36:00] the earth that's why he destroyed the
[36:01] Earth in a flood amen amen but the Bible
[36:05] says Noah found Grace am not that Noah
[36:08] was any better himself if you know what
[36:09] Grace means it's God's unmerited favor
[36:14] Hallelujah God could have killed Noah as
[36:16] well but God kept him alive because he
[36:19] found Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[36:23] amen
[36:25] yes we come here and we see after the
[36:28] flood God found a man who he could would
[36:32] cooporate with his plan
[36:33] Abraham a man who had have faith amen
[36:37] then we had another man in this time
[36:39] Bram all churches didn't want to
[36:41] cooperate with this plan they
[36:43] denominated he poured out his gifts upon
[36:45] Luther then they denominated poured out
[36:48] it upon Wesley they denominated poured
[36:50] it aart
[36:52] amen thata Street Revival they
[36:55] denominated around it yes
[36:58] amen the prophet says denominational
[37:01] Rivers had the Holy Ghost bound amen but
[37:04] he says the evening message loose the
[37:06] Holy Ghost
[37:08] Hallelujah
[37:09] wonderful yes and William branam would
[37:13] come in subjection with the angel of the
[37:14] Lord amenallah he Lear he learned some
[37:18] odd lessons along the way like lose his
[37:19] wife lose his baby but all of that was
[37:22] preparing him for a greater Ministry of
[37:24] how to be in subjection to the angel of
[37:26] the Lord
[37:27] so I'm telling you God will do nothing
[37:29] on the
[37:31] Earth but through man Hallelujah why do
[37:34] you think God has worked now so much to
[37:37] bring his plan think of his plan all
[37:39] that was in God he pour into Christ all
[37:41] that was in Christ he pour into his
[37:42] church through the Holy Ghost so now he
[37:45] wants to have dominion rulership in your
[37:50] life you see as much as you say if you
[37:54] have seen me you've seen Jesus Christ
[37:56] you you also need to have the grace to
[37:58] say it's not I that do the
[38:01] works but it's Jesus that liveth in me
[38:04] take no glory for yourself yeah amen
[38:06] know who's doing the work greater is he
[38:10] that is in me amen amen greater is he
[38:13] that is in
[38:14] me not as soon as the Lord uses you you
[38:17] saw what I
[38:21] did right amen
[38:24] amen the bride has the mind of Christ
[38:26] and she knows what he wants done with
[38:28] the word amen amen yes amen so we're
[38:31] coming to a time now where the bride
[38:35] must be on full display amen amen amen
[38:39] you see every time anytime the word is
[38:41] in the bride there arise a
[38:44] persecution a will start changing
[38:48] laws the Roman Governor now don't we
[38:51] have Rome again on the
[38:52] scene anytime the word is in the bride
[38:56] there will come a persecution yes isn't
[39:00] there promise a squeeze to come why
[39:02] because the word is in a
[39:05] bride
[39:07] amen if you follow the progression of
[39:09] that story you'll see how even though
[39:11] Mary had the word within her she was out
[39:13] of position but God was shifting them
[39:16] back into position amen so he started to
[39:18] use political power to pass laws to
[39:21] bring her back into a position Amen
[39:25] Hallelujah Lord
[39:27] yes you see the bride was the bride was
[39:30] almost like off out of line but God used
[39:35] J Warfare yeah to make the bride realize
[39:39] how unprepared she was for the
[39:42] hour
[39:50] help where's the bride that can close
[39:53] the heavens open the heavens shut the
[39:57] yes
[39:59] yes I hope you get what I'm telling you
[40:03] yes could it be God's grace to us to
[40:05] show us you have the word in you but
[40:08] you're out of position amen was that the
[40:10] eye opener to show us because let me
[40:13] tell you let me be quite
[40:15] Frank a lot of people listen to the
[40:18] government
[40:21] yeah amen amen the L he was just happy
[40:25] to stay at home
[40:27] if it wasn't for some leaders who wanted
[40:29] to open the churches and get back in
[40:30] church and Worship the Lord because they
[40:32] know they don't want to violate
[40:33] scripture the scripture says we're two
[40:35] or more gathered together in my name
[40:37] they am I in the midst the Bible says
[40:39] forget forsake not the assembly together
[40:41] of the Saints amen and the prophet of
[40:43] God also tell us that they'll try and
[40:45] shut these uh churches
[40:47] down but you ask
[40:50] yourself how people were running and
[40:54] hiding people were happy
[40:56] some people are upset when the
[40:57] government said you can go back to
[41:00] church some never returned till they
[41:02] thought it was
[41:04] safe my point is this there's going to
[41:08] come a time when you're going to have to
[41:10] go against the
[41:12] government
[41:14] Hallelujah that's right Glory they're
[41:16] going to shut down so what am I trying
[41:19] to say you want to be a law- Abiding
[41:21] Citizen in a natural Kingdom but when it
[41:24] comes to the things of God you don't
[41:25] want to be a law abiding citizen in this
[41:31] Kingdom you see my father's economy is
[41:34] greater than men's
[41:36] economy amen that's
[41:39] right we can't only use him as Jehovah
[41:43] Rafa there's six other compound names we
[41:46] only W Rafa some only W
[41:50] Gyra but when it comes to being our
[41:52] protection our Banner our peace yes we
[41:56] don't know how to call upon Jehovah he
[41:58] is
[41:59] all he's everything to me amen amen
[42:04] hallelujah so think of why we've been
[42:07] given access to the Seven Seals to the
[42:10] opening of the word just to be highly
[42:13] revelated no God is fixing you into
[42:16] position again Mary was out of position
[42:19] he used the Roman law to get her back
[42:21] into the city that she needed to
[42:23] be so God can have things in his mind
[42:27] like how the Bible says before the
[42:28] foundation of the world but he can't
[42:30] keep it in his mind amen if he keeps it
[42:33] in his mind nothing will happen so he
[42:36] had to speak amen and he said let there
[42:38] be and he got the ball rolling to get
[42:41] all of his thoughts all of his
[42:42] attributes on the earth amen the reason
[42:45] why you are in your condition is because
[42:47] all of your thoughts are in your
[42:49] head you don't realize you possess the
[42:51] power of the spoken word yes amen yes
[42:54] you sit in your bed thinking about
[42:55] things
[42:57] you never put it into practice you never
[42:59] speak and you never command
