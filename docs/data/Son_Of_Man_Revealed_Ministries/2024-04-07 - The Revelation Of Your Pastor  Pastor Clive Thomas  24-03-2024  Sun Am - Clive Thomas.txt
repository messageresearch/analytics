of the Lord amen hallelujah be amen praise the Lord amen good to be found in the house of the Lord this morning amen Resurrection morning amen hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord amen today Service as a reminder to the world that our Lord Jesus Christ amen on the third day he rose again amen so we come to honor the resurrection amen many people are still debating and fasting whether they should gather on the Saturday amen because they say the Sabbath but we know our Lord Jesus Christ fulfilled the law yes so once somebody fulfills the law it no longer needs to be kept as a tradition as a formality amen because there was one man who was found worthy to fulfill the whole law and we enter our rest when we enter into Christ amen that's our rest Christ Jesus amen then we are set free from all Traditions all carnal formalities and and ways of men amen you may be seated praise the Lord hallelujah amen so we wish our brother jefford a happy birthday amen amen I pray that the Lord will continue to bless you keep you by his grace amen thank you for the song blessed with it amen amen hallelujah amen you know part of any celebration ought to be singing yes worship amen and Praises going forth amen amen hallelujah you know there's a thing called Palm Sunday that people are celebrating it was the week before the crucifixion and it's when they lay down the palm branches and our lord Jesus was marching through the streets and they were singing hosana amen hosana blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord amen amen hallelujah so when we come into the house of the Lord the also are to be shouts of joy and victory in the tents of the righteous of the Lord amen hallelujah amen so we haven't come here now to for funeral service but we've come here to honor the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ amen so the song service goes before the preaching to prepare the hearts because you're coming from different atmospheres different walks of life different Spirits amen influencing you but you come now and you submit yourself under the anointing of the spirit allow the music to play amen you remember when the prophet had a bad Spirit Prophet Elijah amen he called a minstral he said bring me a minstral and the music started to change the atmosphere amen so therefore it's vitally important also for the musicians the singers Amen to be prayed up not to come into the house of God app as it as well but there also ought to be a preparation there also ought to be a practice because David says play skillfully before the Lord amen amen so they are here to set the right atmosphere to bring into the right atmosphere of worship amen so when we come we ought not to hold back our worship yes amen but we ought to lift up our hands and begin to praise the Lord begin to worship Him amen don't worry about being dignified in his presence amen don't worry about amen Church Behavior amen but when the Holy Ghost comes Upon Us amen then we start to move and we start to act and we start to Worship the Lord amen you know David's wife was ashamed with the way you Worship the Lord but he was not worshiping for her he was worshiping the Lord in spirit amen hallelujah so we not how to be ashamed when we worshiping our Lord and he said if you thought that was bad he said wait till tomorrow amen I'm going to show you a better dance a better praise amen so we love the Lord and we we're happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen we have with us this morning amen our dear Pastor Clive his dear wife amen let's give our sister a hand amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen Pastor c will be ministering the word of the Lord he's a precious Str to us amen and uh our Elder in the faith amen so we really respect him admire him in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and he's doing a fine work out there in amas with the Believers amen and I believe they are growing in Grace amen hallelujah so don't forget the Easter convention coming up amen this uh coming week amen starting on Friday Saturday and Sunday so the Friday will be two Services you know the times amen at 10:00 a.m. and at 400 p.m. amen Saturday will be at 4 p.m. and Sunday at 10:00 a.m. and 400 p.m. so you look forward to that meetings but I also want you to start to pray for these meetings yes because next weekend is going to be a lot of activity in the spiritual realm amen they're having the Festival of Chariots amen so demon powers are going to be around amen hallelujah and you see now they gone into uh Ramadan and they they coinciding with the Jewish feast amen hallelujah of Passover so what I'm saying the spiritual Realm is going to be full of activity amen I'm talking to spiritual people who understand spiritual things amen so you ought to pray yes amen that there is a breakthrough in the spiritual realm amen when people come into the convention they're not just coming for another Easter convention and a church gathering in that convention I am praying there is Deliverance there is healing there is restoration amen the power of God will be on display amen amen hallelujah you know the of Jesus Christ is not a powerless Army but we are a powerful Army we're an invincible Army amen hallelujah and can you imagine the anointing that's going to be in that place because each one of us carries a lick of fire amen each one of us carries an anointing but when we all come together amen there's going to be one great big bonfire and the devil is in for a problem amen so we are telling him right now you better not show up amen hallelujah because bodies are going to be delivered demon Spirits are going to be on the Run amen hallelujah so you pray for these meetings we are entering a time of spiritual warfare is what I'm trying to tell you amen hallelujah so the devil will try to come and into the meeting he'll also try to hinder you from coming to the meetings but you overcome you already identify his tactics amen praise the Lord praise the Lord so that's my sermon for this morning amen hallelujah everybody feeling good in the house of the Lord amen amen amen amen so let's just sing a song as we invite our dear Pastor Clive thank him amen for uh accepting our invitation to come and share the word of the Lord with us and even as he ministers you pull on the word you know I don't know if you pick up these things but there's a certain time in the in the service where the spirit of the Lord drops down the atmosphere changes when the Pres angel of his presence is here that's a time for you not to remain silent but speak amen what you need speak what you desire amen amen hallelujah so let's just stand together one more time amen praise the Lord what an awesome God we serve what a wonderful King we serve amen also forgot amen I see Chantel is here

Hallelujah we've come to worship and to praise God hallelujah and today I believe the focus is on Pastor Adrien am I right am amen anybody in the house of God am amen amen the focus is Christ Jesus but we want to appreciate amen Pastor aan thank you Pastor for allowing us to come come by amen um we are a as you mention the friends of the of the church amen amen and uh not only from the time you took over pastor aan but long before that as well amen amen so we've had a longstanding relationship with Pastor genan Ron genen and now his son Hallelujah we want to appreciate God for you appreciate God for each one of you as well amen hallelujah want to quickly open in the scripture Hallelujah and um I believe today we are having an appreciation so I'm going to title my message a message that Pastor Adrian might not be able to preach in his own church Hallelujah uh so I want to speak on the revelation of your pastor amen hallelujah the revelation of your pastor Hallelujah I I won't be able to preach this in my church maybe I should call Pastor there I'll give you the notes amen hallelujah so uh we want to open in the book of Jeremiah chapter 3 Hallelujah Jeremiah chapter 3 P aan came toas um and he blessed at the Tabernacle there and Pastor Adrian they're looking forward to seeing you again hallelujah amen it's today's date 2403 praise the Lord you contend with me in the book of Jeremiah I think that's the one yes Jeremiah chap 3 let's read verse 15 amen the Bible says I will give you pastors according to Mine Heart what shall feed you with knowledge and understanding amen now please take note for those of you who believed or still believe that you put your hand up and voted Pastor Adrian in you are wrong because the Bible tells us I will give you pastors amen amen according to my heart Hallelujah so God anointed you to raise your hand God anointed you to do the voting or whatever you did Hallelujah to select your pastor and elect your pastor but my brothers and sisters Hallelujah the Bible says and I will give you pastors according to my heart amen so the pastor that you have that is a pastor of this Tabernacle is a pastor that God gave hallelujah amen which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding hallelujah praise the lord it's on the projection there amen and I believe and for those of you who don't know I respect Pastor Adrian's Ministry and I respect it a lot amen amen and what you need to understand is that you have a pastor who's got a very powerful Ministry at the moment amen hallelujah so it says here which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding the next scripture I want to read is Isaiah Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 11 hallelujah amen praise the Lord the Bible says he shall feed his flock are you with me like a shepherd He Shall Gather the Lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently leave those that are with young amen amen hallelujah let's turn to the next scripture which is Acts chapter 20 acts 20: 28 the Bible says take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost had made you overseers yes Amen to feed the Church of God which he had purchased with his own blood amen for I know this that after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock I'll show you just now in one of the quotations the importance of the pastor's role when it comes to Grievous wolves coming in amen all also of yourselves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them let me not make no bones about this Hallelujah also of yourselves are highlighted in red here also of yourselves shall men arise I don't want to prophesy but I want to kill that spirit amen are you with me the Bible says also of yourself men shall arise amen speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them this is the cause of breakaways in churches amen hallelujah and my last scripture before I ask you to take your seat is Hebrew chapter 13 and verse 17 the Bible says obey them that have rule over you amen and submit yourselves amen for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief amen for that is unprofitable for you the Bible says obey them that have rule over you spiritually speaking who has ruled over you your pastor and submit yourselves amen for the watch for your souls yes amen Pastor Adrian's main interest Hallelujah is yes we thank God for the convention we thank God for the programs we thank God for the services we thank God for all of that but the main purpose is to ensure that all of you make the Rapture that is the main purpose amen so he says for watch your souls as they must give account Hallelujah the pastor must give account for his local assembly and if you c a revelation your soul is in the hands of the pastor and he's got to present it to the Lord one of these days and he's got to account for your soul hallelujah amen must give account that they may do it with joy yes you know sometimes at funerals Pastor Adrian we go to funerals and I'm not a liar I tell you the way it is you know some some some places you go and the coffin is there and somebody is there and these pastors are lying through their teeth Hallelujah they are lying through their teeth saying this brother was so good and this brother was that and that and that and this brother is going to make it in the Rapture is going to you know Hallelujah and in times like that I don't lie maybe I'll give you an idea idea I just come there and I say this brother had his life however he lived his life you know but I'm not here to preach to him he's dead and he's gone I'm here to preach to you so let's preach that's how I run away from telling lies hallelujah amen and the Bible says and they would do it Hallelujah and they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you my topic today is the revelation of your pastor let's bow our heads and close our eyes our most gracious and Eternal Father we thank you we thank you for this opportunity that we could come behind the sacred desk amen oh Father a sacred desk almighty God that belongs to this local Tabernacle and Father in Heaven they have entrusted me oh Lord to come behind this sacred desk and I pray oh Lord even as I encourage the church this morning oh Father through the holy ghost that they oh Lord will get closer Mighty God to you that they will catch a revelation of their past oh Father in heaven and Father in Heaven as we move forward oh father as they give oh Father honor to their Pastor oh Father who who leads them and soul is in his hands oh Lord and he's got to give an account we ask father that you would bless each one of us bless the reading of the word bless the inspiration as well and take full control of Our Lives this morning in Jesus mighty name we pray and all God's people say amen amen Hallelujah you may take your seats Hallelujah I was preaching one time in India and I forgot to tell them to sit down and they stood there for the whole 1 and a half hours and I thought they were all anointed Hallelujah and later on I heard and I asked the pastor why didn't people sit down he said because you didn't tell them to Hallelujah am hallelujah amen hallelujah amen amen my brothers and sisters I've got a few points around your pastor and also me but not so much me because you're going to kind of take stock and sorting to put you on the spotlight Pastor Hallelujah you might Hallelujah but uh I believe whatever I'm saying here because I know Pastor Adrian amen he's got his heart in the right place amen hallelujah and so the first point that I want to make amen and most of the things that I want to say Amen I'm not going to be Evangelistic because it's the type of thought that we have today uh the first thing that we need to understand amen hallelujah is that uh he is supposed to be a righteous man obviously a pastor can't be an unrighteous man Hallelujah and the prophet says my brothers and sisters in the message 1952 I am the resurrection and the life amen hallelujah the next slide please Hallelujah he says this is the house of judgment the house of God where God comes down and passes his judgment your pastor is supposed to be a righteous man the congregations supposed to be with him 100% amen yes those of you 99 98 and downwards we'll have all call for you later the pastor is supposed to be a righteous man Hallelujah and that we agree 100% the congregation supposed to be with him 100% you are supposed to be just 100% together if your pastor says we're going left then all of you must go left if your pastor says right we've got to go right now what happens is sometimes amen we feel that we are longer than the pastor in the message sometimes we feel that we know more quotations and we read the church ages 10 times and the seals 20 times and therefore we can actually give the page number and the paragraph number and therefore we know better than the pastor but remember the pastor is the man that has been called by God appointed by God and has been placed here by God am he's been given to you to lead you brothers and sisters you know on wedes day we had a service and we spoke on obedience and you know brothers and sisters uh let me just say this in context many of times the brothers are gone to work so when we go to work at 7:00 we go to work or 6:00 or whatever whatever time you go to work and you only arrive home at 6: 5 6 in the afternoon in the meantime the wife woke up she had breakfast she did whatever she can she went into prayer she then put a message on she listened to the message for 2 hours which you didn't listen to yet are all of you with me and then uh uh you know eventually she goes and reads the Bible or reads a message or do does whatever it and at the end of the day when you come home you know not all of us are preachers Brothers yes but the Bible was very clear and he says you sisters stay silent in the churches and if you want to know anything yes you go home and ask your husband yes now some of us that's the word right amen and some of you sisters believe you know more than your husband it might be true are you with me because you got more time to spend in the word than your husband and when he comes from work he's tired and the amount of time he spends in the word compared to how much time you spend you might not you might know more but what does the Bible say Amen the Bible says still go to ask him amen yes the Bible doesn't say that you need to go minister to your husband the there's an order in the Bible amen and the Bible is saying brothers and sister sisters keep silent in the church if you have any question go home and ask your husband now some sisters believe no what's the use when and asking my husband what does he know are you with me that thing of what does he know be very careful the Bible clearly says go and ask him yes Hallelujah whether he knows it or he doesn't know it your job is to ask him Hallelujah and if he doesn't know he'll consult his pastor and give you the answer but my brothers and sisters what you also need to understand here how is when it comes to the pasture of the Tabernacle a young man groomed under a very good Ministry amen hallelujah but you might be older in age you might be older in the message you might not no more but what does the Bible say he is your pastor amen he is your shepherd He is your leader and if he says this way the reason why there's Corruptions in the churches is because some people are pulling this way and some people are pulling that way and they are disobeying the rulership of the Tabernacle amen hallelujah so brothers and sisters whether you know more or or whatever it is when the pastor says you just follow and watch the blessing over your life amen I say watch The Blessing over your life amen I'll give you an example and live examples you know brothers and sisters there was one time amen when I first got into the ministry about 20 years ago not Ministry when I first became a pastor about 20 years ago and uh you know there was there were other brothers and there was one brother who got into the message long long before me and uh and he was a deacon and so brothers and sisters he one day he sat with me in the presence of an unbelieving home we went to minister there and and he then told the unbelievers he said you see your pastor you see our pastor here hallelujah I can teach him a few things in the house of an unbeliever I know more than him I've been long in the message I've been that and that and that you know brothers and sisters Hallelujah just by making those statements he dropped his point of leadership in other words he never had leadership he believed he can lead himself yeah that was his greatest mistake yes this is what happened number one he was a manager at Toyota he lost his job I'm not giving anybody threats but I'm just telling you obedience and Disobedience yes that's right it's a very very uh uh uh it's a very serious matter yes amen and so brothers and sisters number one he lost his job as he came home tried to do one or two things and then he he tested God by doing something else he tested God but one day he came to my house and he together with his family and we were dealing with a matter and he said no no no Pastor uh uh you know uh uh let death strike and I said but you know that's a very serious statement you know when we make statements we don't realize there's a God that is alive amen when we make statements we make it from an intellectual concept not realizing that we're dealing with spiritual matters with a god that is alive amen hallelujah so watch your mouth and watch what you say so this brother just made blurted out that statements and he said you know what this is how we we we can't get anywhere with this whoever it is let them die but the brother was siding with his wife and he and trying to show him that do not side with your wife your your wife might be wrong few weeks Down the Line a fit woman went to the hospital for some pain in the chest and on that Sunday morning she then couldn't breathe and she lost her life I'm talking about Weeks Later thereafter things went wrong and wrong and wrong until he left the message completely left the message Hallelujah and the simple reason is because the first point is he came against leadership amen amen hallelujah the Bible says here the congregation supposed to be with him 100% you are supposed to be just 100% together are all of you with me amen amen this is the truth and this is what the prophet says hallelujah so therefore if you feel I'm a bit hard but at least we're helping somebody amen and in there if you're not then Satan's got a way to get to get in you got a loophole somewhere so have everything cleared out amen hallelujah second thing my brothers and sisters I said number one Hallelujah he's got to be Hallelujah a righteous man amen number two he is a Watchman over his flock right amen hallelujah now what is a Watchman a Watchman is somebody that goes onto a tower yeah and he's able to see something that you cannot see very much related to my first point all of you with me you might think from the quotations and you might think from your intellect and you might think from your own understanding that what I'm doing is right and the pastor might be saying but this is not the way to go yes and my brothers and sisters the reason why he's got a conviction of that is because he's a Watchman he can see around the corner where you cannot see amen someone driving at 120 km down the road amen and all of a sudden there's a bu there's a board on the side that says slow down to 60 km yeah do you know why that body is there that body is there because somebody drove before m and somebody knows that there's a sharp Bend and there's a cliff going down and at 120 km you will not make that corner but somebody's been there before somebody saw it before and you are coming down at 120 and if you disobey you will end up down the cliff yes amen but if you obey the board and you slow down to 60 km per hour my brother my sister you will take that bend safely yes and in the same way brothers and sisters Hallelujah your pastor Hallelujah is actually Hallelujah is a Watchman over the flock amen amen the prophet says in that message or in question and answers amen 1954 now in order to be a correct Pastor or Minister you've got to watch your congregation amen are you with me if you see the enemy coming in then slip right over here and say here just a minute see now that's the wrong thing are you with me and see then you're watching the Bible says take heed to the flock to feed the flock which the Holy Ghost has made you overseer over Hallelujah now if you fail to do that God is going to make you answer for it see that's right amen so it's our duty brothers and sisters you know some people when you tell them hey you know what uh uh that brother there please do not go and fellowship there because it's poison the pastor won't tell you is poison but the pastor will nicely tell you yeah he nicely tell you you know what there's some contamination coming from that side Hallelujah I don't know how Pastor Adrian tells you in no uncertain terms or tells you in different ways but in anas we tell them in no uncertain terms Hallelujah there's poison down there if you eat it you're going to die and so brothers and sisters some people believe that because of jealousy that we don't want you to go on fellowship with so and so no brothers and sisters we're not jealous about nothing amen this is the prophet yes this is what he says he says Grievous wolves will come for the sheep and sheep cannot lead sheep you've got to have a shepher and the shepherd will tell you whether it's the right company to keep or it's the wrong company to keep Hallelujah so brothers and sisters hallelujah amen you've got to watch a congregation you've got to be a Watchman over your congregation hallelujah amen now listen to this one the third one pastors are suspicious people they will watch you we are suspicious people hallelujah the prophet says in the godhead explained he says and I think that pastors sometimes are suspicious of things that they hear and I think that they have a right to be are you with me yeah we are suspicious characters pastors are suspicious people hallelujah we don't take everything that you say yes Hallelujah we re we check behind whether it's the spirit of God or not we are suspicious of everything amen hallelujah and I think they have a right to be because if I understand the translation of the word pastor pastor means Shepherd and if a pastor would seem to be just a little bit suspicious that should not bother anyone Hallelujah you mustn't come to your p and say l but Pastor I told you you don't believe me no he doesn't the prophet says he won't Hallelujah hey Pastor you know how long I've been with you and still till this day yes till this day till death until the day of the Rapture will be suspicious Hallelujah everything you say to us will think twice because we are Shepherds amen hallelujah amen so brothers and sisters I the fourth one is quite easy he is to stay with the word amen amen and feed his flock I do not have a doubt whatsoever I said to you brothers and sisters Hallelujah I've got a lot of respect for the ministry of your pastor amen hallelujah and there are many others that have respect for the ministry of your pastor as well amen I know it's being taped but I'll say it some people are being threatened by this ministry as well oh yes and we don't have a problem with that Hallelujah we've got work to do that is God's work whether people are threatened by the ministry or not hallelujah it's a powerful Ministry to stand with the ministry Hallelujah Lord he is to stay with the word and feed his flock thank you Lord amen and God keeps his word the prophet says I told you last night this is God's urum Hallelujah if any kind of Fantastics rise whever they are in this little church whatever it is Pastor stay with the word amen hallelujah amen our heav is noted for these things hallelujah amen noted for these doctrines coming in I know we have a a a pot D pot and everything from China and everywhere comes through it comes through Durban Hallelujah and if you look at the doctrines that comes through deran it's amazing everything natural Times Are Spiritual right Hallelujah all the doctrin two two two jesuses and you name it Hallelujah everything comes in Hallelujah but do me one favor we have God's urum T the lights must flash Hallelujah and if the lights do not fles Hallelujah then stay away from it Hallelujah the prophet says brothers and sisters stay with the word Pastor stay with the word don't feed these sheep something that will kill them stay right with the word amen hallelujah yes amen and you know we have the message of the hour yes we have the revealed word of the amen and we stay with that word amen you know brothers and sisters H you know some people come and they say what's your Revelation what's your new revelation all Mysteries have been revealed yes are you with me it's been given to us amen and when we preach we refer somewhere yes hallelujah amen I've got nothing to hide we ref what I'm preaching here today is not from Pastor C hallelujah it's from the prophet from the message of the hour amen so you stay right with the word yes in white little Bethlehem oh Pastor that's your job and they eat sheep food oh yes are you with me not alonex they do that in Catholic churches Hallelujah sheep food God's word we feed upon his word not anything else amen sheep food alone that word nothing else amen just look how the prophet is emphasizing it hallelujah it's word and word alone sheep's food Hallelujah not the things that come on TBN and all of those things amen hallelujah we've got absolute word of God we've got revealed Vindicated word of God am that's what we stay with Hallelujah so brothers and sisters that's what uh uh uh the pastor is supposed to do amen stay with the word feish she himen number five he is higher and have Revelation above his congregation amen I touched on this earlier are you are you with me Hallelujah he is higher yes one time I was told I was told listen you can't live higher than your pastor you need to sell up your house until your pastor build a double story that was the understanding I'm talking in the message by the way Hallelujah living higher than the pastor amen and I was told in no uncertain terms I was told you will not continue living there you cannot have a five-bedroom house where the pastor has a three-bedroom house you cannot have a swimming pool while the pastor doesn't have a swimming pool you are living higher than the pastor yeah let's read the quotation Amen in the p Ian Church Age The Hidden manner a little something special what is the special not something to the blessings of the Holy Ghost oh no that's for the whole congregation but the hidden manner was a special Revelation amen amenallah let's not mix this thing brothers and sisters you know let let's not mix this thing of intellectualism yes a professor who is studying the Seven Seals who's not in the message yeah I'm giving you a vague example let's say he's doing a paper on the Seven Seals that we have and he takes the book and he then analyzes it and he spends years three years doing that to become a professor he's not in the message he becomes a professor because he knows the Seven Seals M and he studies it so well but there's no Spirit attached to it amen are all of you with me yes there's a difference between having an intellectual conception of the message of the hour and having the spirit attached Amen to the Revelation amen amen hallelujah so the hidden manner was a special Revelation cuz he had to teach the others amen see was a more was a little more knowledge of the scripture that he could teach others he is supposed to be amen is that right you'll never live no higher than your pastor amen amen not houses uh not cars no not money Hallelujah you know brothers and sisters if you get promoted we are happy amen not ties well that too are all of you with me if you catch the understanding the more blessed you are the more blessed we are and I always say this I can be driving a VW Beetle and you will buy a brand new Mercedes and I will come in to uh uh bless that vehicle and I'll be so happy for you amen because your blessing is my blessing amen hallelujah it shows growth it shows blessing there's no jealousy attached to it Hallelujah so we're not talking natural here yes Hallelujah you you'll never live no higher than your pastor you remember that amen cuz he is the Shepherd that feeds you all of you with me if he is the shepherd he's got to know where the Mana is yes to feed the Sheep amen amen you might know the word hallelujah but for that particular Sunday the pastor or the shepherd knows exactly what word is required for this particular church amen why because he's a Shepherd why because he's in prayer room why because he's a Watchman on the on the tower amen hallelujah we don't just come and pre preach anything that we feel yes Hallelujah wonder the night that I don't really sleep is on a Saturday night amen the reason being is we might have a thought we might have our notes we might have the quotation but we want to find the mind of God Amen Hallelujah because when we come here and when we speak to the church we need to have the mind of God because we might not have visited you we don't know your stories we don't know what you're going through but who does that it's the shepherd amen wonderful hallelujah amen and the shepherd knows exactly what word you require for that particular day hallelujah amen amen sometimes you don't like vegetables but if the menu is vegetables and you are hungry you just have to come and sit and eat here are you with me then I know you are Eagle so what he does is he puts a few pieces of meat yeah with the vegetables so that you have a balance [Music] diet amen all of you with me amen hallelujah sometimes you might not like this you don't like spinach you don't like brel you don't like this and that and the other but sometimes that's what on the table am Hallelujah and that's what you've got to eat if he's a Shepherd he's got to know where the Mana is to feed the Sheep amen hallelujah do you know brothers and sisters even if he invites somebody to come and Minister here he is is actually finding the mind of God to say I want so and so to come and Minister yes in other words he's taken you as the Sheep to that green pasture oh yes why because he's the shepherd amen and he knows what the church requires hallelujah amen and how the angel came to me the prophet says the church will never live higher than its Pastor teachers you seldom find that if you got a good sound saying gospel teacher yes you'll usually find that type of church and it's just where your pastor leads you the pastors that feed that you feed on Amen in that message why it had to be Shepherds not some man-made Hersman yes and that's a point that I'm making Hallelujah but a god-given Hersman amen who feed the sheep upon sheep hooden Hallelujah not poisonous peas Hallelujah are you with me amen so that is where the the the pastor comes in so this is what I'm trying to say brothers and sisters Hallelujah your pastor is a young man but nobody can live higher than the pastor amen spiritually speak yes he's a man on the Watchtower he knows what you need he knows what you need to feed on for that particular Sunday or that particular Tuesday Wednesday or Thursday or whichever service he's having he knows what you need yes he goes into prayer and he knows the Tabernacle you know brothers and sisters if you look at amas for example amas is a unique uh uh uh uh you know uh uh unique congregation and uh you've got to have a man that is placed there to be able to feed that particular congregation with manner that they require yes Hallelujah and so it's it's different and therefore your pastor has been called for you yes the time when Pastor kasani told me Pastor can you please come and be the pastor I'm going to East East London and the people are requesting you to come and be the pastor uh in Durban I used to minister once per month when he was gone to uh uh Eastern Cape or or or PE and uh so the time came when he was permanently leaving and he said to me Pastor can you come and take over the church and I said uh Pastor kasani unfortunately I cannot I won't be able to my plate is full in anas Hallelujah and I won't be able to Hallelujah so it's another man's congregation are you with me and I know that I want I can come and preach yeah but to Shepherd yeah it's a very difficult thing and you've got to seek the Lord and find out if it is uh uh if it is there amen he uh number six he is to be Fearless with the truth amen amen hallelujah I'm saying Fearless with the truth I believe and I know Pastor Adrian's Ministry he calls a spade a spade amen hallelujah he doesn't use fancy words like garden tools Spade is a spade oh is a and that's Pastor Adrian so in Jehovah JRA the prophet says what we need is God-fearing preachers who tells the truth amen amen that's right now that's what makes the separation amen you know within a pastor you get the different Ministries that sometimes he's an evangelist sometimes he's a teacher sometimes he's just Pastor Hallelujah so he's got all the Ministries under him and out of the pastor comes the other Ministries as well so if you believe you're an evangelist it will come out of the pastor's Ministry are you with me if you are a teacher it'll come out of the pastor's Ministry but we are GPS General Practitioners Hallelujah then there are other people who become Specialists evangelist is a specialist in this field and I I want to say this I will never touch an evangelist I can evangelize Hallelujah as a GP as a general practitioner but the Evangelist is an evangelist Hallelujah a teacher is a teacher I can teach but I'll never outshine a teacher and that is why the five fingers are different the fivefold ministry is different and please as a congregation never ever compare one Ministry with the other never ever say brother so and so teaches so well it teachers better than Pastor Adrian no no no Pastor Adrian is a pastor you can't compare a teacher with a pastor amen you can't compare an evangelist with a pastor you can't compare and what you need to do brothers and sisters when an evangelist comes behind the pulpit you say amen and you support that evangelist 100% but never ever compare that Ministry with another brother's Ministry it is wrong because we are all different five fingers are different never compare each brother is unique in their Ministry and if you can understand that brothers and sisters there will never be a breakaway because we understand each each Ministry we appreciate each Ministry and every Ministry that comes here we will salute those Ministries Hallelujah it says if I was choosing a pastor and I was on the board and I had to select a pastor and he was one of those wishy-washy kind of cified guys like that I sure wouldn't vote him into my church we need pastors with a backbone yes amen hallelujah amen he says here I'd vot him out and get a man that did believe God's word and took God's word and preached it and stood on it I want a son of Abraham up there a Son of God Amen that's what we need Hallelujah we don't need wishy-washy cified guys you know sometimes you'll say you know we walk out of the church when the pastor is preaching especially these kinds of preaching Hallelujah say it the way it is yeah Hallelujah and when you walk out be careful when you say hey you know what Pastor was throwing stones Pastor got no time to come and hear your stories amen are you with me you discuss with so and so and that so and so discuss with so and so don't put pastor in between them yes Hallelujah the pastor you know you know brothers and sisters someone a few weeks or months ago someone said hey you know you heard what the pastor was saying hey the pastor was only talking about me and only preaching about me and so on and so forth and you know brothers and sisters I asked the one question I said do you think I've got time the whole Saturday night to think about you do you think I must go and prepare six seven pages of notes based on the thinking that there's only one person there must think about I'm wasting my time we don't do that Hallelujah now this is where the difference is instead of saying throwing stones when the prayer altar comes and when the pastor says those of you want to raise your hands or those of you who want to come to the altar that word of throwing stones in actual fact means you convicted and your conviction you're passing the back onto the pastor to say Pastor heard that story somewhere from today stop it yeah are you with me there's no throwing of stones we are in prayer yes and if the Lord speaks to us as I read that other quotation he says the house of God is the house of judgment and God will come but through who amen through the ministry through the pastor amen and that's God's servant speaking to the church so in future when you want to say Stone throwing just do me a favor you won't find this in the Oxford dictionary but the synonym for stone throwing in the gospel is conviction are you with me Hallelujah the professors will kill me for this but it's called conviction yeah it's not Stone throwing it's called conviction meaning I am guilty Hallelujah I am charged Hallelujah let me just raise my hands and pay the F amen and walk out of your happy somebody but if you walk out bitter saying that there was Stone throwing I knew about my story I saw his car in that house and those people know my story Hallelujah he went there for something else to those people's house in fact he just parked his car there and went to the neighbor's house and you think you went to hear your story Hallelujah so brothers and sisters the prophet says get a man that did believe God's word and took God's word and preached it and stood on it I want a son of Abraham there a Son of God in that message Faith 1956 the prophet says you know when you go to choose your pastor usually the people choosing their Pastor they want to choose a good mixer oh we want a fellow that's sociable and that can do this and do that you know sometimes we pastors we are we we are accused of being stubborn people no don't don't don't accuse us of that we are who we are we're not stubborn sometimes we just you know our minds and our thoughts and our Spirits just gets caught up with something else hallah we got nothing against you Hallelujah we want a a fellow that's sociable that can do this and do that God don't call for that kind of man God calls for separators Hallelujah a lot of times people choosing their Pastor little cified boys that's ashamed to say what truth is and a lot of pastors are afraid to tell people where they are standing on account of their meal ticket yes amen hallelujah brothers and sisters Hallelujah we do not believe in that meal ticket yes Hallelujah I I salute Pastor Adrian One Time One Pastor came to me and he said to me Pastor CLI you got such a good Ministry you need to become a full-time Pastor you need to leave work and become a full-time pastor and that was another pastor and I said to him uh Pastor you know what who told you I'm not full-time in fact you might be parttime the reason being is when they wake up in the morning everybody's gone to work there's nothing to do are all of you with me take the fishing rod full-time past enough take the fishing rod and go to the beach the whole day if you want to counsel people you counsel after 5 and am I right people come from work you visit homes and whatever it is unless there's emergencies but brothers and sisters this is what I said to the pastor I said I am full time am when I wake up in the morning and I go and sit in my office I meet hundreds of people amen and I minister to hundreds of souls I have an opportunity that you do not have your opportunity is when you wake up you see the four walls of your house the opportunity that I have is I'm out of the house and I'm meeting people and I am counseling people amen hallelujah so much so that one day I'm just giving you one example of the power of being a full-time PR preacher while walking I'm talking mil de brother yeah Hallelujah a meal ticket we don't worry about Meal Ticket Pastor Adrian is working he got his money Hallelujah and therefore we will preach what we are supposed to preach whether you're a manager of whoever wherever it is we still preach the word of God we are not man Pleasers amen we don't please anybody oh yes you accept the word brothers and sisters this is spiritual matters amen hallelujah and so uh uh one day Hallelujah now let's leave that story so brothers and sisters what I'm what I'm saying to you is this Hallelujah we are working and therefore we won't preach to compromise and offend a brother or or a sister no we won't we just preach it the way it is you like it or you don't like it and if you don't like it come to the altar we pray for you and you'll become a better person spiritually Hallelujah so pastors are afraid to tell people where they are standing on account of their meal tickets Hallelujah in the in the message of deceived Church by the world we want a bunch of men of God who don't compromise on the word but preach the truth and stand on the baptism of the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen and seven he is to be a God sent over his community Hallelujah now if you if you look at this brothers and sisters there are certain times when the community comes and says pastor we don't have a pastor we need to bury this somebody and that somebody that they want to bury we don't even know we haven't even seen them but the prophet tells me that if I'm a pastor I'm a pastor to the community anybody can just just put that body to the ground but it is an opportunity for me to speak to those that are alive and I'll never miss that opportunity amen but then there are some people in the message will say hey but Pastor you know what you're a message believer you're a message Pastor how did you do this funeral how did you do that how did you do that brothers and sisters the motive that I have is different from you I am the pastor I'm looking for that Soul amen amen God is giving me an opportunity to go and bury somebody and look at their face while they dead for the first time I never saw them when they were alive Hallelujah I did many of those funerals and many people came to the Lord based on that amen hallelujah why for me it's not a funeral service it's an open a service Hallelujah the prophet says what doest thou here he says oh there's are lots of times they don't want to claim it but a God sent man to a community is a pastor of the entire Community amen are all of you with me amen so Pastor Adrien is a is a pastor of Phoenix he's a pastor of the community he's not only a pastor to those that are in the four walls of this building amen whether he Baptist Presbyterian or who it is God anoints his man not your man it's his man amen and he will not compromise and the people sometimes hates him that is a fact people outside hate us they will talk ill about us they'll call us Cults yeah false preachers and everything else but that doesn't change the fact that my Prophet told me that we are pastors to that same Community do you know that Elijah was a pastor to Jezebel amen hallelujah and yet he ran away from his own congregation remember are all of you with me yes Hallelujah that's the fact amen and the people sometimes hates him because he stands for the truth but yet he's a God's Pastor for the hour amen amen verse uh not verse number eight he's a gift from God hallelujah if ever you had a gift from God is your pastor hallelujah what it takes to overcome all unbelief so each of you people who has a Godly Pastor has a gift from God oh thank you Lord in your church amen can we give the Lord a round of applause amen God has actually given you a gift and the gift that God has given you is your pastor amen he is to pray for the sick and cast out devils in both Body and Soul so every time he comes and preach he does a soul cleansing and demons are casted out through the preaching Hallelujah the body those of you who read demonology will know Hallelujah sickness and all other things also in the message Kon it says listen if you are sick your Godly Pastor he his holy Sanctified hands upon you you know you call him to pray for for you all of you with you know some pastors are mechanics they work with gree all day are you with me at the end of the day they wash their hands with DEA and that same hand is Anointed by God amen amen according to scripture to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen that's God's word are all of you with me amen it says believe me that I am able to do this in 1950 says you've got a Tormentor in your soul see your pastor you've got a t t t torment in your body that's what I'm here for amen so whether your body is tormented hallelujah or whether your soul is tormented some of you you know when you have a soul torment you want to doubt the message you want to doubt the word you want to doubt God your soul you want to doubt your standing in the message you want to doubt predestination in your life that is where you come to the pastor cuz those things are tormenting you and the pastor's authority over the Tormentor yes amen even your bodies Hallelujah when you talk of sickness and you talk of all of those things number nine he is to cry out against worldliness and disorder in the body that's the body of Christ are you with me he is to cry out against worldliness so sometimes when Pastor Adrian comes here and he does evangelism and you think it's very hard no no no you sisters you do it in your own house in those days when we were not Christians just before Good Friday we'll have oil bath besides the oil bath all the curtains Will Come Out Sisters if you're doing it it's okay but don't do it just before Good Friday it's like a it's like a ordinance you'll take all the curtains out what are you doing No Good Friday coming Wasing all the curtains the beds will come out everything will come out spring cleaning time Hallelujah so brothers and sisters sometimes in the church when the pastor preaches hallelujah it's spring cleaning time amen hallelujah sometimes we are so common we walk into our rooms we sleep we dress the bed and so on and we walk out not realizing in some corner of the house the spider spider is making webs there and every day because of commonness you didn't realize but one day when the pastor comes and he says evangelism today all the cob webs come out am amen hallelujah so God sets up his Tower in the Forman letter r the prophet says God sets up his Tower he puts somebody there your pastor will scream out against it amen are you with me Hallelujah have not I sent thee sometimes I preach pretty rough because I see that somebody is getting out of line remember what the prophet says in the preview of the Bride he said get back online amen yes and we are reiterating what the prophet said in our messages get back online Hallelujah let me tell you what's happening in these days brothers and sisters our education system is corrupt yes I am from education and I'll tell you straight Hallelujah the things that they teach becomes normality but in the message it's not normal Hallelujah and we've got to clean out the church we've got to keep you intact amen hallelujah there's all kinds of bills coming up Bella Bill and all kinds of bills that are coming up and propagating things that are against the word of God yes and that is where your pastor comes in but when modernism comes in and when Hollywood steps into the church we then do things because of commonness and we think it is right but it is not right Hallelujah sometimes I preach pretty rough because I see that somebody's getting out of line you see we are supposed to do that a real daddy will amen why he'd shake you and say here get back here in line and if he is a real true father yes so some sometimes sometimes your pastor has to weigh you down on something just love him that much more yes because he's a real father to you amen are you with me amen when I take the belt out for my children it's not because I hate them it's not because I want to chase them out of the house it's because I have discovered that something went wrong in their lives and I want to put them back on track amen and the whole idea is to put them back on track teach them a lesson and this is what the prophet is saying just love him that much more because he's a real father to you Hallelujah you see trying to keep you lined up because he's watching over your soul which is the Holy Ghost he's made him the overseer of the church and you must always watch that so the pastor is the overseer of the church and when he knows things are not going according to the to the word he will come with an Evangelistic message do the clean up and clean out the church amen amen hallelujah the marriage of the Lamb a pastor will let his church get by with such things without blasting the tar out tar out of it from the pulpit he is a what we need is men the gospel not with rubber gloves but with the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost with the word amen hallelujah in the position of a believer in Christ the prophet says pray God to send you some sensible sound gospel preacher that will stand in the way and give you a little bit of spanking when you need it and love you when you need it amen isn't that's a father's nature that's also a shepherd's nature that's also a pastor's nature Hallelujah we are fatherly figure amen hallelujah yet the prophet says don't call any man on Earth father it was referring to the Catholic priests we call them Father father father Hallelujah but we have the attribute of father nature when we are Shepherds amen and he says here keep you lined up with the scripture and with this spirit amen oh sorry he says a little bit of spanking when you need it and love you when you need it amen when I was in the school system right um I was the head of the school and I had two deputy principls and I had to appoint the two Deputy principal but what I used to do and I teach people to do it now when I appoint I always appointed one cool calm and collected somebody as a deputy the other person I will employ a very hote headed short tempered somebody are you with me amen now those two Deputy principles are acting on my behalf so what happens is let's say a phone call comes to one of of the teachers in the staff room and the phone call is saying uh you know your mother just passed away so what I would do is I will send one of the two Deputy principles who do you think I'll send I won't send the hote headed guy the hot-headed person will come there and say what you crying for you must go to class but what I would do is I would send that person who cool come and collect it and I say there's someone crying on the in in the staff room I believe they just lost their mother please go and sort it out they will go there with some uh tissues and servs or whatever it is and and and go in Comfort are you with me amen then you'll get another situation there's a class making noise the teacher is sitting in the staff room and never go to class then I'll send this hooted character I say please do me a favor from my window I can see that class is not not sorted out there's noise in the class there's no teacher there the teacher is somewhere else please go and sort it out while sitting in the staff room I can y him he makes no bones about it he goes into the staff room in a very UNC way imagine he's a deputy he's short tempered he just goes B so he goes in there and he says can you do me a favor according to the time table you're supposed to be in class you are shocking just get to class and all the other staff members are watching that now watch your pastor pastors don't have deputies we have deacons but we don't have deputies so sometimes the pastor will come there and when you are crying and by the way we don't carry tissues for you okay and our shoulders might be broad but it's not for your yet are all of you with me that's what Hallelujah that is why when we deal with cases brothers and sisters we want to protect our Ministries when we protect our Ministries we can take our wives we take a deacon or someone if we want to counsel assistant if it's a sensitive matter we'll take someone that we trust amen but never will we go alone as a pastor but one Pastor told me no no no no me I can sit with these young girls I can sit with the all the sisters alone and uh because I got the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost where Holy Ghost in This flesh still in this flesh are you with me never we don't allow that we don't have broad shoulders for others to cry on Hallelujah not that we hard brothers and sisters not that we don't have a heart but we do in our own way so please understand us as pastors amen so sometimes Hallelujah okay it says here pray to God to send you some sensible sound preacher that will stand in the way and give you a little bit of spanking when you need it and love you when you need it and keep you lined up with the scripture and with the spirit he's a Shepherd watching your soul If he if you got that Pastor flee to God and pray for him all the time listen to him you know brother and sister s is giving you two things here number one pray for him but don't pray for him when you whenever you feel like do you know on your prayer list every day one of the people that must be on your prayer list is the pastor the pastor's wife and the pastor's family amen you need to pray for them yes amen keep that in your list every day amen I'll tell you what the devil wants to destroy the church amen in order to destroy the church he'll try to destroy the headship of the church and that is why as a congregation we must pray for the pastor amen hallelujah don't worry I'm about to close the next thing is he is to be a humble man now I'm I'm not contradicting myself I'll show you through the next quotation right he's supposed to be a humble man you know brothers and sisters sometimes when we roll up our sleeves not literally when we roll up our sleeves people then question whether we really a pastor are you with me hey he calls himself a pastor what kind pastor this are you with me but watch this the quotation says in church order the pastor must be a man that has got a very humble way about him are you with me but it doesn't say full stop it says comma and in that comma it says but not too humble amen are you with me Hallelujah but what he could be like the Lord Jesus Christ amen when he seen wrong going on in the church he planted ropes are you with me yes Jesus gone violent and ran them out of the church so you don't come with this trick of saying hey but Pastor you call yourself a pastor you're doing like this if you are doing wrong and the pastor is whooping you amen he's platting ropes and he's literally whooping you too Hallelujah he is like Jesus Christ we can't stand for wrong in the church amen and when he sees wrong going on the church he plattered ropes and ran them out of the church and now the Church of God the Church of God is the highest of judgment and the pastor is the highest order in the church amen so it's a pastor's responsibility amen hallelujah I I you know we mustn't you know use that quotation in the wrong way we are a very short tempered pastor and get angry for everything then there's something wrong are you with me yes Hallelujah you get some pastors you their toe they your head are you with me immediately they don't wait but we've got to be humble but not too humble amen there comes a moment when people must not take advantage over the past amen and when that happens the pastor is able to stand based on the word of God hallelujah so the pastor is here hallelujah the highest of judgment amen the Church of God is the highest of judgment and the pastor is the highest order in the church the pastor I I hope you know I should have put all that in uh in capital letters the pastor is the highest order in the church 11 he is your [Music] teacher he's your spiritual husband he is your counselor and he is your source of blessings the prophet says in y he says but listen to your pastor you know sometimes you know sometimes we make our decisions without consulting we don't consult the pastor we don't consult anybody and we in fact you consult other people yeah uh you consult agents but not the pastor yeah and when things go wrong you then want to blame the pastor for a decision that he wasn't part of initially Hallelujah it says listen to your pastor a good good God sent man a teacher that will send and tell you just exactly what to do so I'm saying some people you packed your bag you paid for the accommodation packed your bag you even put it in your boot and then you drive to the pastor's house pastor we thinking of going on holiday what you think what you want him to think are you with me and if the pastor says you know what according to the pastor he believes now or he says hey you know what uh you shouldn't be going this week you should be going the following and people get angry with the pastor's decision you know why because they already made up their mind and therefore the Lord allows a perfect will and a permissive world there's dangers with the permissive world he allows you to go the pastor is there and the pastor already knew that you already booked your ticket somehow or the other you're just coming as an ordinance to say Pastor can you give us can you can you tell us whether we should go or shouldn't go and the Pastor said no go the reason why the pastor says that is he knows you booked he knows you packed up and he knows in one hour's time you're ready to leave so he allows you to leave then when things go wrong don't come back to your pastor because you didn't consult when before buying the ticket you didn't consult but listen to your pastor a good god-sent man a teacher that will send you and tell you exactly what to do because himself is Anointed with the Holy Ghost and watch him he will stay right smack with the word how can I overcome your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking amen you see hallelujah amen your pastor is your husband man spiritually speaking if you ever feel to do something or a revelation or something comes to you strangely something warningly or something be careful Satan is as Sly and slick as he can be see put it with the word of God and consult your pastor many people make decisions I'm talking about huge decisions and I always say to our church I said listen you if you deciding to buy bread tomorrow don't come to the pastor say Pastor I can I go and buy bread are you with me yes that's a decision you need on a daily basis but if you're going to open a business or if you're going to invest somewhere or you going to do something not that you know hey you know who's he you know why do I have to tell him he's a God sent man he needs to pray for you he needs to tell you the direction that you're going is right or wrong so it's important for you to consult your pastor on important decisions that you that you're doing not on buying bread or going to the shop for doing your groceries and so on those things Pastor don't have to know are you with me amen I might be saying something do you ask them to tell you when they're going to buy groc sorry Hallelujah so brothers and sisters when it comes to Major decisions in your life Hallelujah I said to my church you're coming here and you're saying please pray for finance we got a financial problem you got a financial this and please come you coming to the pastor now but when you went and open mady's account you never came to the pastor when you went and open F's account you never came to the pastor when you went and put all those black cards gold cards blue cards all kind of Cards into your uh purse you never consulted the pastor now when the headache when you got Financial headache over yourself now you're coming to the pastor Pastor so long I'm in the message Pastor I pay my ti so Faithfully but I don't know why financially I'm down no you know you're earning th000 and making $ 2,000 account what you expect are you with me this is how shops do it they advertise when you go to your your your shop and you uh present your card or when you pay your monthly account you're paying 1,000 you know know how good they are they'll tell you you now have credit for 2,000 so what did you do are you paying that account no because immediately you're going shelf to shelf aisle to aisle you paid 1,000 you're buying for 1,500 you know why the counter told you you paid 1,000 you got 2,000 credit how is that magic no it's headache then later on you come to us and you say Pastor I'm so faithful in the church pastor I pay my tithe Pastor I don't know what's happening you know what's happening you went and bought consult your pastor Hallelujah all you young men and young women that are starting work I always said to to people I said to them listen last month how much did you have nothing zero the month before how much you had nothing zero all of a sudden you now got a degree you're starting work how much do you have how much will you get this month no 20,000 what are you going to do with the 20,000 all of a sudden a man that is earning 20,000 cash will want to go and start opening accounts all over when you got cash are all of you with me amen and out of the 20,000 how much do you need I told one brother I said to him how much do you need to survive we did a calculation before he collected his first salary a teacher and he said that amount I said how much do you need for spending that amount and so on and so forth I said how much do you have in your kitty now well over 10 12,000 I said okay do me a favor take that 10 12,000 and put it away 18 months later he came to me I was no longer there around him 18 months later he came to me and he said you know what Pastor I've got money to put my foundation and start building my house I've got 160,000 in my bank account after 18 months but you know what others do with the same amount they're going to make more accounts 18 months later after getting a nice degree and a nice job and earning so much of money they got more accounts than anything else consult your pastor Hallelujah in be not afraid it is I you love to see your pastor walk up on the step and you love him cuz you know he's going to pray and honor your home that is when he's visiting your home Hallelujah his presence means so much to you you want to get the children in gather around so the pastor's blessing can be upon the children amen the last point I want to make brothers and sisters Hallelujah he should have the confidence of his people amen if pastors don't have the confidence of the people then forget it amen we're not going anywhere in 1 Corinthians 4:16 the Bible says wherefore I beseech you be ye followers of me who's saying this Paul brothers and sisters I'm saying follow your pastor and your pastor follows the word amen 1 Corinthians 11 verse 1 it says be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ amen the third one in Philippians amen chter 3:1 17 Brethren be followers together of me he's not ashamed Paul in three scriptures he's not ashamed to say Follow Me Be followers of me you know why because God ordained a man amen to be his representative Hallelujah and who is Pastor Adrian Pastor Adrien is an ambassador for Christ amen he is standing here in the place of Jesus Christ do you know brothers and sisters when the Bible says what you bind on Earth will be bound in heaven what you loose on Earth will be Loos in heaven when Pastor Adrien binds something here all Heaven stands behind him amen when Pastor Adrien loses something on Earth all Heaven stands with him so that's the importance brothers and sisters of a servant of God who's called a pastor Hallelujah and you be followers Brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as he have us for an ensemble in Believers th this he says that's the reason your pastor can do nothing for you listen to this you've got to have faith in him and confidence in him as a man of God Amen are all of you with me amen if you doubt your pastor forget him doing anything for you if you doubt him forget having faith in God but I know this you've got to have confidence in the man you're dealing with or it won't do you any good to do any dealing that's true you've got to believe your pastor amen he said but you've got to believe him and have confidence in him as God's men Amen in other words he's the ambassador of Heaven Hallelujah whatever it is that he does here all Heaven stands with him Hallelujah and that last quotation that I'm going to read I am the resurrection and the life he says now now when you got to have confidence this is the house of judgment the house of God where God comes down and passes his judgment listen God comes down and passes his judgment your pastor is supposed to be a righteous man the congregations supposed to be with him 100 100% you are supposed to be just 100% together and in there you are not and if you not then Satan's got a way to get in Hallelujah you got a loophole somewhere so have everything cleared out amen you know brothers and sisters
