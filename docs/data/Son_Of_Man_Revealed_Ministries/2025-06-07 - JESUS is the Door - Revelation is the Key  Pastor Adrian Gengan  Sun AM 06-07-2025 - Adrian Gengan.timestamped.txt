[3:04] precious name for Lord and Savior Jesus
[3:06] Christ. Amen. Why don't you greet your
[3:08] brother and sisters? Say, "Welcome the
[3:10] house of the Lord." Amen. It's good to
[3:12] be in the house of the Lord. Amen.
[3:14] Praise the Lord.
[3:17] Amen. Through it all, we've learned to
[3:19] trust in Jesus.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; We've learned to trust in God.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our happiness doesn't determine on
[3:27] our circumstances.
[3:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't determine if things are
[3:30] going good or bad.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we remain joyful at all times
[3:34] in our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So we
[3:36] greet our brother Lionel. Amen. Sister
[3:38] Lydia, Dilia, and brother Malachi. You
[3:41] know, I was thinking these children are
[3:44] getting so big. Every time we see them,
[3:46] they just advance. We need to see you
[3:49] guys more often.
[3:51] Amen. So, God bless you. Amen. I pray
[3:53] that you're blessed. Amen. And serving
[3:55] the Lord faithfully. And I pray you'll
[3:57] be blessed this morning in the house of
[3:58] the Lord. Amen. Let's turn to our
[4:00] Bibles.
[4:02] We'll turn to second Peter chapter 1.
[4:05] Hallelujah. We've been reading second
[4:07] Peter
[4:09] chapter 1. Amen. And you know we've been
[4:14] speaking on divine the divine nature,
[4:17] the divine character, the divine power.
[4:19] Amen.
[4:21] How many of you have been following the
[4:23] series?
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And all of it is
[4:26] divine. It's not earthly.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; So we want to progress. Amen. into a
[4:30] further verse there. Amen. And just read
[4:34] second Peter. So you'll find that after
[4:37] all of these things are built from faith
[4:40] to charity, it says, "If these things
[4:44] abound in you, you shall neither be
[4:46] barren nor unfruitful."
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now we want to get to a
[4:49] point where we are speaking second Peter
[4:52] 1 11. And I want to speak this to be
[4:55] able maybe you want to place the message
[4:56] correctly. place why the prophet and
[4:59] what his ministry is for.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And and in there is
[5:03] our ministry.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; He came with a ministry for a purpose.
[5:07] &gt;&gt; So 2 Peter 1:11 says, "For so an
[5:10] entrance, an entrance is a door."
[5:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; Shall be ministered unto you.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; So we need a ministry.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; We need a ministry to open this door. An
[5:25] entrance shall be ministered unto you.
[5:27] Amen.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; The only way that door is being opened
[5:29] is through a ministry.
[5:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; And how is it being opened to us? He
[5:34] says abundantly.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; What rich revelation we have of the
[5:38] word.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; Now an entrance is ministered unto you
[5:43] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom.
[5:46] You can't get into the kingdom unless
[5:48] you come by this ministry.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; What is he saying?
[5:54] You're being ministered into this
[5:56] kingdom,
[5:57] &gt;&gt; into the everlasting kingdom, not an an
[5:59] ordinary kingdom now of our Lord and
[6:02] Savior Jesus Christ. You may be seated.
[6:04] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; The Lord had blessings through the
[6:08] reading of his word.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:19] Now notice if you were paying attention
[6:21] you would find in second Peter chapter 1
[6:25] it's coming through seven church ages
[6:28] &gt;&gt; from faith to charity.
[6:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; Right? So the legacy church age was the
[6:33] seven church age.
[6:35] &gt;&gt; So which means that this entrance
[6:38] &gt;&gt; is coming after the seven church age.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. I need a better amen than that.
[6:44] Amen. Amen.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; What we have in the form of the message
[6:47] of the hour, you can't place it in the
[6:49] church age.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; Because this is not a ministry to get
[6:54] people to church.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:57] &gt;&gt; This is not a ministry to get church
[6:58] members.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; This is a ministry to prepare you for
[7:02] the greatest triumph of our lives, the
[7:05] changing of our bodies.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not interested in church
[7:10] membership.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; Sure, if you come to church, we'll
[7:12] preach. We'll be happy to see you. But
[7:14] we are more concerned. Amen. To prepare
[7:16] you for the translation of the body.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Wonderful.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you want just ordinary
[7:24] eternal life, you can go to any
[7:25] denomination.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; They will not be lost. They will come
[7:28] through great tribulation. You'll have
[7:30] eternal life.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; But this message,
[7:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. This message takes you to the
[7:37] throne room.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; This message, Amen, takes you to be
[7:40] married to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[7:43] Amen.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; This is a different message.
[7:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:47] &gt;&gt; So, we're not saying you can't get a
[7:49] salvation in denominations, you can.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; And if that's all you're looking for, by
[7:53] all means, go there.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; But if you're wanting, Amen. to be a
[7:57] united with the King of Kings and the
[7:59] Lord of Lords.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Then this is the ministry, the message
[8:02] of the hour to prepare you for that.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; I know many people preach, oh,
[8:09] denominations, you lost. No, he's
[8:11] speaking non.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; In the book of Revelation, it says they
[8:15] came out of great tribulation. He asked
[8:17] John, "Who are these?" He says, "These
[8:18] are they that have come through great
[8:20] tribulation."
[8:23] &gt;&gt; And he says he couldn't number them.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; But we are a special class of people.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; So an entrance, a door is open to us.
[8:33] And it came via a ministry.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; And ministries after him.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. to open the door and abundantly put
[8:41] us into the everlasting kingdom. So you
[8:44] would know that this kingdom is not in
[8:46] the legacy in church age.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; But this morning, we're just laying
[8:53] foundation. So we won't get to
[8:54] everything. Amen. I'm very conscious of
[8:59] giving you digestible things to ponder
[9:01] upon and then coming on the next service
[9:03] and building on that.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; So we won't rush everything this
[9:06] morning. Amen. So we are finding here
[9:09] that when Jesus says in John 10:7 that I
[9:12] am the door,
[9:15] &gt;&gt; the door to the kingdom. You can put up
[9:17] the next slide there. Amen. Praise the
[9:18] Lord.
[9:25] So I'm contrasting this. If you put up
[9:27] the next slide, you'll see there it
[9:29] says, "For so an entrance shall be
[9:31] ministered unto you." But if you look at
[9:35] Malachi verse 4 and 5, it says, "I send
[9:38] you."
[9:42] &gt;&gt; So it's both tied together.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; The entrance being ministered is coming
[9:47] via Malachi 4 because he's sending
[9:49] Elijah the prophet.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before the coming of the great and
[9:55] dreadful day of the Lord.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:59] Brother, if you go to the very last
[10:00] slide there,
[10:02] slide 19. Jesus is saying that I am the
[10:06] door. Right? Jesus said unto them,
[10:09] verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the
[10:12] door. I am the door to the kingdom.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; And in Revelation 10:7, it says, "But in
[10:18] the days of the voice of the seventh
[10:19] angel, when he shall begin the sound,
[10:22] the mystery of God should be finished."
[10:24] &gt;&gt; So maybe you're wondering, how does this
[10:26] two relate? Yes.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; He's going to open. This is now the key
[10:31] to the door.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; The mystery of God is now going to be
[10:36] the key to the door.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know that any door needs a
[10:44] key to unlock the door of Jesus because
[10:47] Jesus said, "I am the door." We want to
[10:50] unlock the key to Jesus.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; And why unlock the door? If you are
[10:57] reading here the mystery of God, the
[11:00] door being opened, it's a door to
[11:02] marriage.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; When you are reading this, Revelation
[11:08] 10:7, he is sending a prophetic gift to
[11:11] open the door to bring you to the
[11:13] marriage of the lamb.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Because what is the mystery of God? Yes.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; In that day you shall know as I was in
[11:22] the father, the father in me, I in you,
[11:25] you in me.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; We are all one mystery.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; That is speaking of marriage in and
[11:35] Jesus is saying in that day, what day?
[11:37] This day
[11:38] &gt;&gt; after denominational ages have run out.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:43] So to unlock the door of Jesus. Now many
[11:45] people want to know Jesus but it's not
[11:48] given to everyone to know Jesus.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; They know the Jesus of salvation but
[11:53] they don't know Jesus the husband.
[11:56] &gt;&gt; Oh come on now.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; People have heard of Jesus and they can
[11:59] receive salvation but yet he's coming to
[12:02] unveil himself in a personal way to his
[12:05] lovely wife.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. Lord.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That sounded like glory, glory,
[12:11] glory. that you were saying there. Amen.
[12:13] Praise the Lord.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Out of the mouth of babes. Praise the
[12:16] Lord.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; So, we've got to have a key to open the
[12:23] door to marriage.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to have the key. Now,
[12:28] what did Jesus say the key was?
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 16 verse uh we'll
[12:33] read there verse 19. Let's see what the
[12:35] key to open the door is.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll take it from the Bible so
[12:40] you can see these things and get these
[12:42] things. So in Matthew chapter 16, Jesus
[12:45] is saying, "And I will give you the keys
[12:48] to the kingdom."
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[12:51] &gt;&gt; He's going to give the keys to the
[12:53] kingdom, and whatsoever you shall bind
[12:56] on earth shall be bound in heaven, and
[12:58] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[13:00] shall be loosed in heaven.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Before we get to that part, let's just
[13:04] go two verses up to 17. Amen.
[13:08] Now what Jesus had just asked him who do
[13:11] you say I the son of man am?
[13:13] &gt;&gt; And now Peter is saying blessed art thou
[13:16] Simon Peter told him thou art the
[13:18] Christ. If you put up verse 16 you'll
[13:19] see it there. Thou art the Christ the
[13:22] son of the living God.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; In verse 17 Jesus is now saying flesh
[13:26] and blood.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; The byproduct has not revealed it unto
[13:30] you.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; He says but my father which is in
[13:35] heaven.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; Right? Then he goes to verse 18 there.
[13:38] And I say unto you that thou art Peter
[13:40] and upon this rock.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; I will build my church.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; So our identity is locked up in
[13:48] revealing Christ.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; When Simon Peter told Jesus who he was,
[13:53] he revealed to him who he was.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when the prophet of Malachi 4
[13:59] is coming to reveal to us the mystery of
[14:01] God, he is also revealing to us the
[14:03] mystery of ourselves. Yes.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Upon this rock I will build my church.
[14:09] So what is he saying? Upon revelation I
[14:11] will build my church.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; So what we are saying revelation is the
[14:15] key to the door.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Revelation is the key to unlock Jesus.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; Revelation is the key to marriage.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; And the gates of hell shall not prevail
[14:26] against it. Why will the gates of hell
[14:28] not prevail against it?
[14:31] Jesus has got the key to the gates of
[14:33] hell.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; And that key that he got to the gates of
[14:35] hell, he gave to his church.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; If they don't want to open up the gates,
[14:40] you don't even have to kick it down.
[14:41] Amen. You got the key to open up the
[14:43] gates of hell and pull your loved ones
[14:45] out.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; I don't think some of you heard me.
[14:48] You've got the key to open the gates of
[14:50] hell and go and claim back your loved
[14:52] ones.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; What did Abraham do? He went to the
[14:57] gates of Sodom and Gomorrah. He went to
[14:59] the gates of hell to pull back Lot.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What do you think
[15:06] Auntie Wright did that day?
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Her sons were lost.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; They were trapped by the gates of hell.
[15:11] But by the spoken word of her own mouth,
[15:13] she opened the gates of hell. And she
[15:15] said, "I want the salvation of my two
[15:17] boys."
[15:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; We We've not just been called to come to
[15:23] your message, church. I'm in the
[15:24] message. I'm in the message of believer
[15:26] prophet. It's time you start to operate
[15:28] the word. It's time you start to operate
[15:30] in the kingdom. It's about time we start
[15:32] to realize who we are and what we've
[15:34] been called for.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say it again. We're not
[15:38] called for church membership.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. So to
[15:42] to get into marriage, to get into the
[15:44] door, you've got to have the key of
[15:46] revelation as we just built now.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the door and revelation is the
[15:50] key to unlock the door.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Why? We want to get into the everlasting
[15:54] kingdom. Praise the Lord. So to get the
[15:58] key of revelation, God can't bypass
[16:00] scripture.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; How do we get the key then? You're
[16:04] saying upon this rock, I will build my
[16:06] church.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; Upon revelation, I will build my church.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; So we all want the key. How many of you
[16:13] want the key?
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; But how do we get the key?
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; God won't bypass protocol.
[16:19] &gt;&gt; He won't bypass his own word. Yes, sir.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; If you go to Amos 3:7, let's see how the
[16:24] key will come to us.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Surely,
[16:34] &gt;&gt; Surely, surely.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Surely the Lord God will do nothing.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; But he revealth his secret unto his
[16:43] servant, the prophets.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; That's why the church world don't know.
[16:47] It's a mystery to them. They have
[16:49] rejected the prophet. But he is
[16:51] revealing his secret to the prophet. But
[16:53] they don't want the prophet. So they
[16:55] don't get the secrets.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; To reject the prophet is to reject the
[17:00] secrets.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; He revealed his secret to his servant,
[17:07] the prophets. So you see how important
[17:09] the prophet is. I want the prophet
[17:11] because he's revealing to me the
[17:13] secrets.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; He's revealing to me the mind of God.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we have the key now.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; Because we have all accepted the prophet
[17:25] &gt;&gt; we've all accepted the message.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; So, we now we got the key to unlock
[17:29] Jesus
[17:31] &gt;&gt; for marriage. What did Ruth do to Boaz?
[17:34] She unlocked him for marriage.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; She put him in a spot.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; Are you getting what I'm saying?
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Because you have accepted the prophet of
[17:45] this age
[17:46] &gt;&gt; who is God's provided way. Amen.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; You've got the right to take the key.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; And go sit at his feet.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; Unlock him for marriage.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Because we have come God's provided way.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; Now who in this day want to do God a
[18:06] service without it being his will?
[18:08] &gt;&gt; Do you know there are many preachers
[18:10] that are preaching that are not called
[18:11] to preach?
[18:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes, sir.
[18:16] &gt;&gt; They're trying to do God his service
[18:18] without his will.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; They're trying to start a ministry, it's
[18:21] failing. They're trying to start a
[18:22] ministry, it's failing. They're trying
[18:23] to preach and people are getting more
[18:24] confused.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; They're trying to They want to do God
[18:27] his service.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; But it's not his will.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; Why don't we just stay in God's provided
[18:35] way and his will?
[18:36] &gt;&gt; His will is his word.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; So, we need a prophet. And I'll also say
[18:45] we need the five-fold because I'll show
[18:46] you the quote.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; Not only the prophet, but we need the
[18:50] five-fold who's under the prophet.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. To minister us into the kingdom.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, a true five-fold
[18:58] ministry will pull you into the kingdom.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll make every effort to make
[19:03] sure that you get into the kingdom. We
[19:05] can't bring you so far into the church
[19:07] and not get you into the kingdom. We
[19:09] have brought too many people to church,
[19:11] but not into the kingdom.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:14] Amen.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that when we unlocking the
[19:19] key to the kingdom, every kingdom must
[19:22] have a king.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; This kingdom, the king has not abducted
[19:26] the throne.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; There's a king on the throne.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; And every kingdom, the pride of every
[19:33] king.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; Is his queen.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Think of King Asus.
[19:40] He wanted to show Vast the queen
[19:43] &gt;&gt; but she refused to come.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; You know what? You know what Kingerus
[19:51] was singing? Let the beauty of King
[19:55] Aserus be seen in her
[19:57] &gt;&gt; all his wonderful
[20:00] passionate.
[20:03] He wanted his life to be seen in vastly
[20:06] when he had showed all his wealth. He
[20:08] had shown all his riches. He had shown
[20:10] all his military might.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; He realized it was not enough.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; The queen needed to come to be on
[20:17] display.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; And in this time and this season, God
[20:21] has his queen on display.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Every king has a kingdom and our king is
[20:29] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; And our king must have his queen. Amen.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; That's why he says when he's coming now
[20:35] in the preach, he says when he's coming
[20:37] out from that intercessory role, he is
[20:39] looking for his queen. That's a direct
[20:41] quote. He's looking for his queen.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Why is coming into his kingdom?
[20:47] Praise the Lord.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; So this is where now we come into the
[20:53] picture. We know there's a door. We know
[20:56] there's a key.
[20:58] We know we've got the prophetic key, the
[21:00] revelation. But when we when he now came
[21:02] for us, he came to us like Eliza
[21:05] &gt;&gt; to tell us I have called you for
[21:08] marriage.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; I made this journey
[21:13] &gt;&gt; from 1933
[21:16] &gt;&gt; to 1963
[21:18] &gt;&gt; for marriage.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; You're just thinking about Elisa making
[21:24] that long journey, but you're not seeing
[21:27] the prophet AI journey from 1933.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. all the way to 1963
[21:32] &gt;&gt; to get a bride. I no longer call you
[21:35] church.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; I call you bride.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Our also took a journey and he was also
[21:41] led by the angel of God.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; Talk about revelation coming fresh.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; Our prophet had an angel leading him.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Our prophet was the Eliza.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So when he is
[21:58] calling us into the kingdom, he's now
[22:00] showing us that we are part of the
[22:02] picture.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; That we are called to be the queen. We
[22:05] are called. This is why we've been
[22:06] called into the kingdom and called into
[22:09] eternity. Called into heavenly places.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Called into the shout.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now in Mark 4:11,
[22:17] before we progresses, let's just read
[22:19] Mark 4:11 and see what Jesus is saying
[22:22] that this key is not given to everyone
[22:24] else.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; It's to a special class of people. He
[22:27] said to unto them, "Unto you it is given
[22:30] to know the mystery of the kingdom of
[22:32] God."
[22:33] &gt;&gt; You said, "How was it given?"
[22:37] How was it given?
[22:39] I'm sending you the key.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you Elijah.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; Unto you it is given to know the
[22:46] mystery.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; I'm sending you Elijah.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; If you want to understand the mystery,
[22:51] receive Elijah.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:55] But unto them that are without doubt,
[22:58] all you see all these churches filled to
[23:00] capacity,
[23:01] &gt;&gt; good music programs,
[23:03] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't say good music programs.
[23:05] They're good in the eyes of the world.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; Very worldly music programs.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; Nice f not nice. I can't say
[23:17] &gt;&gt; not nice fancy lights. Just go lights in
[23:19] the church.
[23:21] Hey, if you walk into the church now,
[23:23] you'll think it's not daylight then.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Everything is dark.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; They keep it dark and the lights must be
[23:28] bright.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[23:32] &gt;&gt; because they are not the light anymore.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; They need artificial light.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; But he's saying to them that are without
[23:40] all these things are done in parables.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; They know nothing about the mystery.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; They don't they are so bad they can't
[23:48] even understand baptism. Yes.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; Yet baptism is in black and white.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; No, I see it there. But in our church
[23:56] traditions, we follow the elders.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; You'll follow them to nowhere. You know
[24:02] where.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "The blind lead the blind.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; They'll both fall into the ditch."
[24:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; I know these are very basic things, but
[24:15] I pray I'm placing it in such a way that
[24:16] it makes sense.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; I'm still a young man.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; The prophet says young man will come and
[24:23] pick these things up.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; And place it to make sense.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[24:31] Amen. So we are talking about the
[24:33] entrance to the open door of marriage.
[24:36] The entrance which is revelation. The
[24:38] key to the open door of marriage.
[24:42] And the only way that the door can be
[24:45] opened is after the church has been
[24:47] built through seven church ages. He
[24:49] can't marry the church while it's still
[24:51] being built.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; He couldn't marry it in the days of
[24:55] Ephesians.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; Neither in the days of Luther or Wesley
[24:59] &gt;&gt; or the latest in church age. He couldn't
[25:01] do it because he was coming to knock and
[25:03] they didn't want to open up the door.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; So now he comes. Where is he coming
[25:10] then? If you say, if you put up the
[25:13] second slide, there
[25:16] maybe the third slide. I want that
[25:17] primatement picture. Yeah.
[25:20] Can they come here to brotherly handas
[25:22] for marriage? Come on now, somebody
[25:25] please
[25:27] &gt;&gt; because the latest didn't open up the
[25:29] door.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; So then where must the marriage take
[25:33] place?
[25:38] &gt;&gt; In the headstone.
[25:41] in the bride age
[25:43] &gt;&gt; and she nears their headstone.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; She's so fitted together with him.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; He says those stones are so close
[25:50] together. You see why many message
[25:53] people are preaching the message of the
[25:54] hour trying to preach a headstone
[25:56] message in the legacy in church age.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; They've not been delivered from their
[26:00] mind to think that this bride is not in
[26:03] the legacy in church age change. She's
[26:04] all the way up in the headstone.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:09] Amen.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; What is he saying? This book is not
[26:13] revealed until the church ages. What
[26:15] book is he talking about? The seven seal
[26:17] book.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Seven seals can't be revealed until the
[26:21] church ages. Denominational ages has run
[26:24] out.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; So which means the book is also revealed
[26:28] where?
[26:30] [Music]
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go back to school. After.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Somebody say after.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; After.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Denominational ages have run out.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; There's time no more. It's only revealed
[26:46] after.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Can you see after in red?
[26:50] &gt;&gt; It's revealed after
[26:52] &gt;&gt; church ages and denominational ages has
[26:55] run out. So the church. Amen. The
[26:57] seventh seal was opened in the
[26:59] headstone.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; The mighty angel coming down the
[27:02] headstone.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. I know I'm breaking some the
[27:05] church theology here right now. I know I
[27:08] am bringing you up to speed with 2025.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Do you know what that means? Let me let
[27:17] me break this down. If you are saying
[27:19] we're still in the legacy in church age,
[27:21] which means they open the door for you.
[27:23] They didn't open it for Jesus.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Some people don't know what we're
[27:27] talking about. Go to Revelation 3:21. Is
[27:29] it 21?
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Let's just put this here for the ones
[27:32] that don't know the message.
[27:35] Amen. I I I I can say I know when the
[27:38] service is going up and I see when it's
[27:40] dipping.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; I know when your theology is getting
[27:43] shaken.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go before this 20. I behold
[27:50] I Jesus.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; I'm one door.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus said he's the door.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; They got their own denominational door
[27:59] &gt;&gt; which means they're preaching another
[28:00] Jesus. Yes.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; So Jesus the door went to their door
[28:08] &gt;&gt; and he's knocking.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; He wants to test his door against their
[28:13] door.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; But their door don't match his door.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; He was looking for someone. This is
[28:20] fresh now. Looking for someone in his
[28:22] image and likeness.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; And they couldn't open it because you
[28:27] need key to unlock door.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:31] if any. So now they couldn't open the
[28:33] door. So he's shouting.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Hey, you that's in there,
[28:38] if any of you can hear my voice."
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Is he shouting through the door?
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Come on. You've read this before, but
[28:47] you've not heard it this way.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; He shouting through the door.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; I'm knocking. That failed.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; I'm shouting.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; If any of you in there hear my voice,
[28:58] &gt;&gt; come out of all my people. Amen.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Be not partakers of our sin.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; If you can do it, I will come in with
[29:06] him
[29:07] &gt;&gt; and suck with him and he with me.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; And then he gives a further promise in
[29:15] 21.
[29:16] To you that overcome, I will grant you
[29:18] sit with me in my throne. That's
[29:20] marriage.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Even as I overcame, I'm sat down with my
[29:22] father in his throne. But my point I was
[29:24] getting to is this. If you believe
[29:26] you're in the legacy in church age, they
[29:27] open the door to you, which means your
[29:29] door match their door.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; How many of you play matching game? You
[29:33] know when they got on foul here and one
[29:34] foul here, but different pictures, you
[29:36] must unlock the cards.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Matching they call it. So which means
[29:40] you match there
[29:44] and they open the legacy and door to
[29:45] you.
[29:47] [Music]
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Now remember everything I'm telling you,
[29:53] I've got quotes to back it up. Amen.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; We are not in the legacy in church age.
[29:58] We are in the headstone.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; If you don't know what this is, this is
[30:04] the coming of the headstone.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; He said, I'll come with shoutings of
[30:08] grace. Grace.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Many people are expecting headstone to
[30:12] come shouting grace. Grace in the
[30:13] millennium.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; What's your need there for?
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Why you need grace in the millennium?
[30:23] He says, "I will come with shoutings of
[30:25] grace." Grace,
[30:28] &gt;&gt; double grace.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Unmmerited favor.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; What is he coming to do? To unlock the
[30:34] revelation of himself.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:40] Amen. Let's see. Amen. If we can get
[30:42] back to some of these things here.
[30:46] So, go to the third slide. Just want to
[30:48] read this to lay down. Some of you may
[30:50] have not read the scripture before, but
[30:52] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[30:54] angel.
[30:56] Now, let me break this down. I hope
[30:58] everyone's listening here.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Let me break this down.
[31:03] We in this church.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; We believe a prophet.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; We believe an end time prophet.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; We believe that he was sent as the
[31:15] seventh angel. Amen.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; You see, I put those picture there to
[31:19] show you who that seventh angel is.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the
[31:24] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[31:27] sound,
[31:28] &gt;&gt; the mystery of God should be finished,
[31:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[31:33] &gt;&gt; As he had declared to his servants the
[31:35] prophets.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Now, you'll find that ties in exactly
[31:37] with Amos 3:7, which means his secrets
[31:39] are coming through this prophet.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; You see this is a vindicated prophet.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll see that above his head is
[31:46] the pillar of fire.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; That's the angel of the Lord.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; That's the same one that led Moses.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; It's the same one that led Paul.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; It's the same one that led brother
[31:57] Brandon.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; And it's the same one leading us this
[32:00] morning.
[32:02] Lord,
[32:05] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Go to the next slide.
[32:09] God has been building his church from
[32:10] the days of Paul
[32:13] &gt;&gt; all the way up. We have come past this
[32:15] now.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness. You see here in this
[32:19] picture, it's a wrong picture. They got
[32:20] an eagle there.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Yeah, yeah." No, it is an
[32:24] eagle. Yes, brother. It's an eagle.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; But the Bible calls him a flying eagle.
[32:28] Here they got a sitting eagle. We got
[32:29] too many sitting eagles.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; It says it's an anointing of a flying
[32:36] eagle. in action
[32:38] &gt;&gt; and in service.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; People getting tired. They want sitting
[32:42] eagle.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; We've been born in an eagle age.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; A flying eagle age.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; So we've established it comes after.
[32:59] What is he saying? The seventh seal book
[33:02] is coming after the church ages.
[33:09] Okay, I'm going to say it one more time.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; And now I want all unbelief to be gone.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal book is opened after
[33:16] seven church ages.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; You'll see now why we are talking about
[33:21] this. Why it needs to be opened after
[33:24] seven church ages. Right now we've been
[33:26] dealing on character, divine character
[33:28] for a while. Let's see now what the
[33:30] prophet of God is going to say here.
[33:32] God's looking for character,
[33:34] &gt;&gt; not membership.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Character. Eliza, when he went to get
[33:38] the bride of Isaac, he sweated it out
[33:40] until he found character.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Any man that comes looking for a woman
[33:45] will look for good, godly character.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; A man will be mad in his head if he's
[33:50] looking for a sexy dressed woman.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Because what you admiring, everyone else
[33:57] is admiring.
[34:01] Hello.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; In me, I want everyone to see how hot my
[34:06] girlfriend is. She'll be very hot in
[34:08] hell.
[34:10] Everyone in hell will see how hot she
[34:11] is.
[34:16] And if we think we're coming to play
[34:17] around in the message, we are going to
[34:19] miss the rapture.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, you miss the
[34:22] rapture,
[34:23] &gt;&gt; you can't go in the tribulation.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; You got a oneway pass. You know, you
[34:27] overplay Monopoly.
[34:29] You know they have a go to jail
[34:31] straight.
[34:35] You all are very good at replacing
[34:36] words. I must say
[34:40] okay and there will be no get out of
[34:42] jail free card.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You read the
[34:47] story of the beggar Lazarus.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; You can't repent when your life is
[34:52] finished.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Today if you hear his voice repent now.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. commit. God is looking for
[34:59] surrender. Why don't we want to
[35:01] surrender our life to Jesus?
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Why don't we want to give our life to
[35:05] Jesus?
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Eliza went to get the bride for Isaac.
[35:11] He sweated it out until he found
[35:13] character.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; So, we're looking for divine character.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Remember, Abraham put him responsible as
[35:21] God puts us. Oh, yeah. We're getting to
[35:24] it now. Amen.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; As God as Abraham put Elea responsible,
[35:31] &gt;&gt; God put us responsible.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. We're ministers.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Hunt my bride.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; You see why I told you it's not only
[35:41] Revelation 10:7.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; It's also the ministers.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Hunt my bride.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; By God's grace, that's what we are doing
[35:49] this morning. Even
[35:50] &gt;&gt; hunting the bride. Yeah.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Now, people would say they're
[35:55] evangelist.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Evangelist.
[35:58] You're in the message called end time
[36:00] evangelism. The prophet saying this is
[36:03] the end time evangelism. Yes, sir.
[36:06] Character.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; What are you saying? Slow it down. Well,
[36:13] if the evangelist don't want to do their
[36:15] job as an evangelist, I will do the work
[36:18] of an evangelist because the work of the
[36:20] end time evangelist is to get character
[36:22] in the people.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Character is not a gift.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; And okay, are we reading this carefully?
[36:34] What message is that? End time
[36:36] evangelism.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Meaning that this is how evangelism must
[36:39] be done in the end time.
[36:46] leave
[36:47] certain things to denominational people.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; We are here yet to hunt the pride.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; What are we saying here?
[36:56] &gt;&gt; What is the top of the quote? Are we
[36:58] anting people for membership?
[36:59] &gt;&gt; No.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; He's saying we're looking for character.
[37:03] Yes.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Sure, we can go out and preach and fill
[37:07] the ship,
[37:09] &gt;&gt; but you could get full of people sitting
[37:10] in the chair without godly character.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; But he says end time evangelism. He says
[37:16] this is the end time evangelism. Yes,
[37:19] sir. Character.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; I know some of you are taking tablets,
[37:26] but you don't have water. You know, it's
[37:27] hard to swallow when you don't have
[37:28] tablets when you don't have water.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; That's how I feel. The word is not
[37:31] getting down your throat
[37:33] &gt;&gt; because you are rejecting you because of
[37:36] your theology and how you've been
[37:37] trained all these years. You are
[37:38] rejecting the tablets of God, the
[37:40] gospels.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; We think evangelism going on the street
[37:47] there.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; End time evangelism is different.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Which means you're sitting in the chair
[37:56] and you don't have divine character.
[38:00] God's molding and shaping your divine
[38:01] character.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Tell your neighbor,
[38:09] don't sleep.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help one another. Help them
[38:15] &gt;&gt; because you're you laughing. You don't
[38:16] know demon powers are coming with
[38:17] sleeping pills. Now,
[38:19] &gt;&gt; while I'm giving gospels, demon powers
[38:21] are coming with sleeping pills.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:25] Hey,
[38:28] see that's coming fresh too.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Now
[38:34] I'm telling you the end time evangelism
[38:35] is hunting the bride and building the
[38:37] character.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; What is the character? We showed you
[38:42] Galatians 5:22.
[38:45] That's the character building of Jesus,
[38:47] &gt;&gt; right? Let's get to the next one now and
[38:49] see. Amen.
[38:51] Hallelujah.
[38:53] Now here the prophet now he just told
[38:55] you what the end time commission is to
[38:57] hunt the bride but here in 19 this was
[39:00] pretty late on in 1964
[39:03] the prophet was kind of getting
[39:05] disillusioned
[39:07] and
[39:09] maybe the commission wasn't too clear so
[39:12] he closed his eyes and he said Lord
[39:14] reveal to me he closed his eyes and he
[39:17] said let the Bible fall open put my
[39:19] finger on a scripture so when he closes
[39:22] his eyes
[39:29] and he opens the Bible,
[39:32] it falls to Genesis 24:7.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[39:39] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Elzah's faith, Abraham's
[39:41] faithful servant, the model servant of
[39:43] the Bible, being sent to the bride for
[39:45] Isaac."
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Remember, we're still dealing. This is
[39:49] how we're getting the key to open the
[39:50] door through him.
[39:55] Chills run over me. Chills don't run
[39:57] over anyone anymore.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; People don't have supernatural
[40:00] experience.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; The prophet says chills run over him.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Hey, this is 1964. It's quite late in
[40:09] his life. He got one more year to live.
[40:11] And he's saying chills ran down his
[40:13] spine.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Hey, do you know people don't have
[40:18] supernatural encounters with the Lord
[40:20] anymore?
[40:21] because they rejecting the moving of the
[40:23] Holy Spirit.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Why? Why will chills run down? Somebody
[40:32] is fine.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; And you get shocked.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; You get awakened.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[40:43] Sure. That's right. With the rest of my
[40:45] message, pulling out the bride.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:52] And the God of heaven will send his
[40:54] angel before you to direct you.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; That's what Abraham told Eliza.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; And that's what the Lord told Moses,
[41:04] "I'll send my angel before thee."
[41:06] &gt;&gt; That's what the the Lord told the
[41:09] prophet in the cave.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; He's going before you. And I want you to
[41:18] know people of God, the angel of God
[41:20] goes before you.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he encamps around you. Do
[41:24] you know what he encamps around? Do you
[41:26] know what encamps around?
[41:28] Meaning you see you don't go to where
[41:30] the angel is in a camping site. You know
[41:32] you got campsites.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; How many of you been to a campsite?
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Meaning you must take your things, your
[41:40] tent, you must take all your equipment
[41:43] and go to the campsite. Yeah,
[41:46] &gt;&gt; this scripture is saying that the angel
[41:49] brings all his equipment
[41:51] &gt;&gt; and he brings his tent
[41:53] &gt;&gt; and he encamps he sets up camp wherever
[41:55] you are.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; We talk about divine character. When God
[42:04] is building up our character, we are
[42:06] saying, "God, get me out of this
[42:08] situation."
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; How many of us are saying that? Amen.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; But if you put up Psalm 23,
[42:16] &gt;&gt; what does he say? Lord, get me out of my
[42:18] situation. But you want character
[42:20] molding. You want God to take you out of
[42:22] the situation. But in Psalm 24, he says
[42:25] he prepares a table before me
[42:27] &gt;&gt; in the presence of my enemies.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; So which means that you want him to come
[42:31] out, God is putting a table and he's
[42:33] saying, "Sit down."
[42:36] Thank you, Lord.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Do you all read Psalm 23?
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Thou preparest a table before me in the
[42:45] presence of mine enemies.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Who? Why would a table be prepared?
[42:49] Somebody tell me. For massage.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. For food.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; So he's saying, I want you to sit down.
[42:59] I've got a meal prepared for you.
[43:02] And in this trial, I want you to eat.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Sit.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Now, if you know that you shouldn't eat
[43:08] and be stressed,
[43:11] &gt;&gt; you must be relaxed.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; You like to eat and be stressed for the
[43:14] kill. The food don't go down nice. How
[43:17] many of you are stressed? You forgot the
[43:19] food is finished and you you don't even
[43:20] know you ate it.
[43:23] But he's saying, "Thou prepareest a
[43:25] table before me in the presence of mine
[43:28] enemies." Amen.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Not only that, while you sitting there,
[43:34] &gt;&gt; it's so hard to get the woman to bring
[43:36] oil and massage you.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Not my wife, but she come massaging.
[43:43] See,
[43:46] he's coming to massage your head. How
[43:49] many of you like my Indian head massage?
[43:53] What is he saying? You anoint my head.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; With oil.
[43:59] My cup runth over where?
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Right in your trial.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Right in the presence of your enemies.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; You're getting food.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; You're getting oil.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; And your cup is running over.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Right in the presence of your enemies.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Which means he didn't take you out of
[44:15] the situation.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; He blessed you abundantly. An entrance
[44:19] was ministered to you right there.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's get back to the slide,
[44:26] brother. So the angel of God is very
[44:28] important. He takes up his tent, his
[44:30] equipment and he comes where you are.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; He encamps around you.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; So the God of heaven will send his angel
[44:40] before you to direct you. He went right
[44:42] straight out and began praying and he
[44:44] met the beautiful Rebecca.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; He met the beautiful Rebecca
[44:52] that become the bride of Isaac. Just a
[44:55] perfect message. Back to the word. Go
[44:57] get that bride. That's a duty. That's
[44:59] what I'm here for. That's what I'm
[45:01] trying to do. He's call out a bride.
[45:03] That's end time evangelism.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; There's another scripture that's tied to
[45:11] brother Brandham. It's it's Luke 17:30.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Now, he says, "The son of man is
[45:15] prophesied to be revealed." And what
[45:17] kind of revelation, what kind of key
[45:20] will it be? Come on now. We still
[45:22] looking at key.
[45:24] What kind of a key will the son of man
[45:26] reveal be? Watch what it says. It'll be
[45:29] the revelation of his living after being
[45:32] crucified for 1900 years and he's raised
[45:35] up raised from the dead and he's alive
[45:37] with us.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; So if we are claiming that Luke 17:30
[45:42] has been revealed,
[45:45] &gt;&gt; what kind of key will it be?
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Proving Jesus Christ is alive amongst
[45:50] us.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I know that brother Brandon
[45:53] proved Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[45:55] today and forever.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; He raised the dead.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; He healed the sick.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Blind eyes were opened.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; All kinds of miracles were there. He
[46:03] even created fish. Amen. Brought fish
[46:05] back to life. Created squirrels. Spoke
[46:07] to storms. Spoke to winds.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; It proved Jesus Christ alive. I am
[46:12] saying now in 2025, the key given to the
[46:15] bride, the son of man is still being
[46:17] revealed through the bride. And it must
[46:19] prove that he is the resurrected Lord
[46:21] Jesus Christ.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:32] Praise the Lord.
[46:35] He says, "And the Holy Spirit always
[46:36] speaks of the word." That's the reason
[46:39] now we're getting to the the
[46:41] nitty-gritty now. Revelation is coming
[46:43] by the seals.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; So the key is coming by the seals.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Come on now. We're following a fortune.
[46:48] We're looking for the key to the door
[46:50] and we are finding how we are getting
[46:51] the key to the door.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; That's the reason the coming of the
[46:55] seals, that's the mysteries coming to us
[46:58] at the finishing of the seventh seal.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's break this down. How many of
[47:06] you believe Revelation 10:7 is
[47:08] fulfilled?
[47:10] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; You sure?
[47:13] &gt;&gt; And you can't back down now.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he said at the finishing
[47:17] of the seventh seal.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Now if you believe the seventh seal is
[47:21] not open,
[47:25] &gt;&gt; you got a problem.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Because he says at the finishing of the
[47:29] seventh seal,
[47:31] &gt;&gt; the mystery of God should be finished.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Which means at the finishing of the
[47:38] seventh seal, Revelation 10:7 sounds.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Hey, are you reading with me?
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we got good grammar? Yeah. We
[47:45] reading properly.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not mislocating. We're not
[47:49] misplacing. We're reading exactly
[47:51] &gt;&gt; at the finishing of the seven seal.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Which means it must be opened.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; The mystery of God should be finished to
[47:59] know what
[48:02] &gt;&gt; revelation. Now, wasn't this what Peter
[48:04] knew to know who he is?
[48:05] &gt;&gt; To know who God is.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; What he is? How he lives?
[48:11] &gt;&gt; His nature. is being
[48:14] &gt;&gt; you're supposed to be all the way up
[48:16] here at that time. He's got a pyramid
[48:18] there in the church.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; And he's showing them the headstone.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; He's showing them the headstone and he's
[48:29] saying, "You're supposed to be all the
[48:30] way up here by that time."
[48:35] &gt;&gt; For what? We've been laboring on
[48:37] adoption for so long. For what? to bring
[48:40] us into the full stature of sons and
[48:43] daughters of God.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we're doing very good with
[48:53] time. We will finish on time. So, just
[48:55] relax and enjoy the word.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Say, "Lord, come right now. Anoint
[49:01] my head with oil."
[49:03] &gt;&gt; If you didn't realize it, your head is
[49:04] being anointed with oil right now.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Right now, your cup is running over.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:15] Right, let's progress this thought. Now,
[49:17] he's talking about Genesis 1:27. We're
[49:19] talking about the bride and groom. We're
[49:21] talking about the door that's open for
[49:23] marriage. He says he created man, male
[49:25] and female. Did you notice the body part
[49:27] was a byproduct?
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Eve's flesh body was a byproduct.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Right now, this flesh body is a
[49:35] byproduct,
[49:37] &gt;&gt; but not the spirit. Yes.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Eve's spirit was not a byproduct.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; The spirit was part of Adam for he was
[49:48] both man and woman spiritually speaking
[49:50] both masculine and feminish.
[49:54] In slide 12 there he says we in flesh in
[49:57] flesh are different.
[50:00] We're like a byproduct.
[50:05] You want to do good,
[50:08] but the flesh is failing you.
[50:12] We got all angels here.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; I see Halo's here.
[50:18] Amen. You want to tell the truth, but
[50:20] lies so easy.
[50:26] He says we in flesh are different. We
[50:29] like a byproduct created being by holy
[50:33] wedlock. Oh, he's coming to marriage
[50:36] now.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; But in spirit we are sons and daughters.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; In spirit we are sons and daughters.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; That's why the apostle Paul is saying
[50:50] now do not walk after the flesh.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Do not walk like a byproduct.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; He says but walk in the spirit. Amen.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Because the spirit man must take control
[50:59] of the byproduct.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; You want to lust up to that woman.
[51:08] You want to tell her, "Thou art a neck
[51:10] like a dove." What? What did he call it?
[51:14] Eh, you didn't read Song of Solomon.
[51:19] Your teeth are like the gates of
[51:21] something, he says. And your eyes are
[51:23] like dove's eyes. Your neck is like a
[51:26] goose.
[51:32] Guys, if you want to be romantic, you
[51:33] must read Song of Solomon. I don't know
[51:35] if this 21st century girls will
[51:36] appreciate that language,
[51:38] but
[51:40] Solomon is very descriptive.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "But in spirit we are
[51:47] sons of God, not some other spirit, but
[51:50] the spirit of the living God."
[51:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember that quote,
[51:53] "We were spirits that rotated off of
[51:56] God. Amen.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He is confirming that our spirit
[51:58] being
[51:59] &gt;&gt; is the same as God.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Not some other spirit but the spirit of
[52:03] the living God.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; We are in his likeness in his unity in
[52:07] the perfect image of the living God
[52:09] because we become sons of sons and
[52:12] daughters.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Right. Next quote. You're going to love
[52:17] this now. Not separated but the same
[52:20] spirit, the same God, the same person
[52:23] joined in wedlock to the eternal. Come
[52:26] on. We are joined in wedlock to the
[52:28] eternal.
[52:30] [Applause]
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; So how come we talk about God like he's
[52:37] a distant being
[52:40] &gt;&gt; when we are joined in only only wedlock
[52:42] to the eternal?
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Watch how it progresses us now. When we
[52:46] are joined in only wedlock to the
[52:48] eternal. See how God planned it that we
[52:50] should not be different but him.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, somebody read that. Come,
[52:56] come swallow that pill now with your
[52:58] water.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; You mustn't be different to the one that
[53:02] you are joined in only wedlock. He's
[53:04] saying he planned that you should not be
[53:06] different, but you should be him.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; You see how wonderful it is to have the
[53:19] key.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; The key to unlock the door to Jesus.
[53:24] Yes.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Not some other being of some other
[53:27] tribe, but a real union and offspring of
[53:30] Almighty done by a holy union. Ah, now
[53:32] we getting into it.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; He opened the door to marriage because
[53:36] he needs a wife to put his seed word
[53:38] into.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; And once his seed word gets into the
[53:42] bride, that's why we're eating the word.
[53:44] The life of Christ is reproduced and we
[53:46] are sons and daughters of God.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the body comes from mother
[53:51] and father, but the spirit comes from
[53:53] God.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Watch. Now, you're not only that, but
[53:59] you're going to the wedding in the sky.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. And you're wearing the wedding band
[54:05] of predestinated
[54:07] unmmerited grace.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the marriage of the lamb, he
[54:13] says, "Where's the ring?" I would now
[54:15] require a token.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; What is the token? Hallelujah.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; How many of you have been to weddings?
[54:22] &gt;&gt; They require a token.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm giving you your wedding
[54:28] band is predestinated.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Unmmerited grace."
[54:33] &gt;&gt; A wedding band of grace unmmerited of
[54:36] your own. God did it himself.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; He knew you before the foundation of the
[54:44] world.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; So he slipped the wedding band on you.
[54:48] where
[54:50] &gt;&gt; I thought when the prophet came and
[54:51] called you out, he slipped the wedding
[54:52] band after that.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; I thought when you received the message
[54:55] of the hour, he slipped the wedding
[54:56] band.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; This God is not taking a chance in
[54:59] Satan's he put the wedding band there in
[55:02] heaven.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Now, when you see the wedding band, you
[55:06] know she's already spoken for. She's
[55:09] already married. You can't go flirt with
[55:11] her. Amen.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; So he slips the wedding band in
[55:18] &gt;&gt; over there.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Put your name on a book."
[55:25] Now
[55:27] you say, "Where's the wedding band?" How
[55:29] did he put the wedding band? He's
[55:30] telling you, but you just need to read
[55:32] it correctly. When he put your name on
[55:34] the book,
[55:36] &gt;&gt; that's when he slipped the wedding band.
[55:37] Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; So the wedding band is as good as him
[55:41] putting the name in the book.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; When he's writing the name, he's saying
[55:45] wedding band.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Putting your name in the book. Praise
[55:50] the Lord.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Now, why was the key given to us? Why
[55:54] was all of this? We're closing now.
[55:56] Amen. Think we got two slides. Why this?
[56:01] What is the opening of? Where's the key?
[56:04] Here it is. He says revealing Christ is
[56:08] the promise of the age.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Christ is revealing himself. He's the
[56:16] promise of the age.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; I believe Lord.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Now, what does Christ mean?
[56:24] The anointed one.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Revealing the anointed one is the
[56:28] promise of the age.
[56:30] Amen.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; When God revealed brother Brandham as
[56:33] the anointed one, he was the promise of
[56:36] the age. Revelation 10:7, Malachi 4:5
[56:39] and 6. Amen. Luke 17:30. He was the
[56:42] promise of the age.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; So what's the promise of this age? Is
[56:48] God still revealing Christ?
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Is he still revealing Christ? Thou must
[56:53] prophesy again. Yes.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; So, revealing Christ, Revelation 10:8-11
[56:58] is now the promise of the age.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; I believe Lord,
[57:05] &gt;&gt; here it is. Now, then what is the
[57:07] opening of the seals? What is the key?
[57:09] What is the revelation? Revealing the
[57:12] anointed one.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; The purpose of revealing the seals is to
[57:17] reveal the anointed one.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Is to reveal Christ.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; He's showing us Christ in us.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; What is the opening of the seals then?
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Revealing Christ.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:8-11 is Christ.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Bless your name, Lord.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Thou must prophesy again.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; It's the promise of the age.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Great is the mystery of godliness. Thank
[57:53] you, Jesus.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Let's go quickly to Colossians 1:13.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:13.
[58:06] Watch now. He had delivered us from the
[58:09] power of darkness.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; So, which means that light is also a
[58:12] power
[58:14] &gt;&gt; and has translated us and at finished
[58:17] work.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; How many of you are waiting for the
[58:20] translation? Hallelujah.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; The other apostle Paul now he hath
[58:25] translated us into the kingdom of his
[58:27] dear son. Are we talking about the door
[58:29] to the kingdom?
[58:30] &gt;&gt; He's saying he's already translated us
[58:33] &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of his dear son. How
[58:36] did he translate us, brother Joshua? How
[58:38] did he translate us, brother Shan? Via
[58:40] the shout. The shout has translated us.
[58:44] [Applause]
[58:46] &gt;&gt; You say, "But I'm waiting for a physical
[58:47] translation." If you don't have the
[58:49] translation of the shout, you won't have
[58:51] a physical translation. To miss the
[58:54] shout is to miss the rapture. To miss
[58:56] the shout is to miss the prophet. To
[58:59] miss the shout, your body is not going
[59:01] to be changed.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; So the shout then is your down payment
[59:04] that you already translated.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; That's why now do you understand the
[59:10] prophet when he says they'll come in
[59:11] that day and they'll say, "Wasn't there
[59:12] supposed to be a rapture?" The prophet
[59:14] is saying, "Our rapture for the living
[59:15] saints is the
[59:18] shout.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; The shout is a message to gather the
[59:22] living saints.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Check your neighbor if he's breathing.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Because if they're not, they need the
[59:28] voice.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; So, they're all breathing, right?
[59:33] &gt;&gt; So, the shout came for you.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; To gather the living saints,
[59:37] &gt;&gt; which means then the shout has already
[59:40] translated you into this kingdom.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Into the headstone. Oh, come on. The
[59:45] shout has already positioned you in the
[59:47] headstone
[59:48] &gt;&gt; only waiting now for the translation of
[59:51] the body.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; That is why now in in John 10:7 there
[59:56] the second last slide there you'll see.
[59:58] Why is it 10:7?
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Why is it 10:7?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus said unto them, I am the
[1:00:08] door.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; John 10:7 is the door.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:7 is the key to the door.
[1:00:14] Let's give God praise as we stand. Amen.
[1:00:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:18] Amen. Worship the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:21] Amen. Let's put up that song, brother.
[1:00:23] Amen. Nathaniel, come and help me here.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; I know you sang the song a few weeks
[1:00:26] ago, but we want to learn it in the
[1:00:28] church. Amen. Let's sing. Amen. Let's
[1:00:30] sing Where Eagles Dare.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; We got the words. We're going to learn
[1:00:35] it and sing it as a church.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I feel blessed this morning.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; God has given us the key to the door.
[1:00:42] Hallelujah.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; There you go. What key?
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing and worship the Lord.
[1:00:57] Amen. Let's take notes of the song.
[1:00:58] Amen. Ben, try and sing this more often.
[1:01:02] I like the second verse and you'll see
[1:01:04] why. Let's sing. Amen.
[1:01:10] We have been born in an eagle age
[1:01:14] by an eagle's promise message
[1:01:18] to manifest the living word for our
[1:01:22] king.
[1:01:25] And we have been given wings to fly.
[1:01:30] Way up in the sky
[1:01:34] we know
[1:01:36] and fly.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; To live in a heavenly.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:01:47] to fly.
[1:01:50] [Music]
[1:01:57] Oh,

[1:02:03] a living reality.
[1:02:08] So,

[1:02:13] true in the sky.
[1:02:18] Set your wings and fly.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[1:02:26] Amen. We've been gathered by the shout.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; We have been gathered by the shout.
[1:02:34] A message that call us out
[1:02:38] from this world of fear and doubt.
[1:02:44] And many have been given eyes to see
[1:02:48] all the mysteries that they reveal.
[1:02:52] our life
[1:02:54] pro
[1:02:56] to see our position
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; to see our position in God's word.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:03:09] Every

[1:03:17] word
[1:03:19] reality
[1:03:22] reality
[1:03:24] so

[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:35] Set your way and fly.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:03:47] We are not called to be a child
[1:03:52] on the ground
[1:03:55] to be living up
[1:03:58] [Music]
[1:04:02] change

[1:05:02] We have been gathered by the sh
[1:05:06] [Music]

[1:05:20] mysteries that we reveal
[1:05:23] our life
[1:05:25] prophecy
[1:05:27] to see our position to see our position

[1:06:03] [Music]
[1:06:11] Amen.
[1:06:13] Praise.
[1:06:14] Let me ask you eagles. Do you dare to
[1:06:16] fly up? Do you dare to fly up there this

[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful savior we are.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:07:57] Church, let me tell you something.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus, we read it earlier. He said,
[1:08:02] "Whatever you bind on earth is bound in
[1:08:03] heaven."
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Whatever you loose on earth is loosed in
[1:08:07] heaven.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Now, let me explain very quickly
[1:08:11] how the hierarchy of heaven works.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; There's God Almighty
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; who holds all power in his hands.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; And who's beneath him?
[1:08:22] [Music]
[1:08:24] We is sons and daughters.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; We is queen.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Angels are not above you. Angels are
[1:08:31] servants.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Angels are ministering spirits.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; So it's God. Then it's you. That's why
[1:08:38] he says, "Whatever you bind on earth,
[1:08:40] I'll live and honor your word in
[1:08:41] heaven."
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; You carry such a power.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Such an anointing.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Don't devalue yourself.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Understand who we are. That we are part
[1:08:54] of the mystery of God.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; That's the key that was given to us.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; To unlock the door to the full benefits.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless his name.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Bless his name.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody reach out and grab a hold
[1:09:16] of the angel's wings.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Grab a hold of the angel of God right
[1:09:20] now.
[1:09:22] Thank you Jesus.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Oh we give you glory Jesus.
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Savior.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Maybe this morning you understood the
[1:09:38] word a bit differently. Maybe it made
[1:09:40] more sense to you. Maybe it came out a
[1:09:41] bit more clear and you understand your
[1:09:44] purpose in the kingdom. Why you were
[1:09:45] called? Why the prophet? Why the key to
[1:09:48] the door? What you are called for? your
[1:09:50] call for marriage

[1:11:55] oracle of the most high God. And Lord
[1:11:57] Jesus, these are words of eternal life,
[1:12:00] oh God. And Lord, we know Lord that you

[1:12:12] God. And Lord, we know this bride to

[1:12:16] in the book of Revelation when John was
[1:12:18] called up eye, Lord. He was typing the
[1:12:20] bride with just a shadow of God. But
[1:12:22] this is the reality of God. For you,
[1:12:24] Lord, you caught us up. You you made us
[1:12:26] to be caught up in the headstone. Oh
[1:12:28] God, taken us out of the church ages, oh
[1:12:30] God. And Lord, we know right now we are
[1:12:33] flying in the heavenlies. Oh God, with
[1:12:35] the revelation that we have, oh God, it
[1:12:37] is the revelation that is not keeping us
[1:12:39] earthbound. It's the revelation Lord of
[1:12:42] finding us of amnesia showing us who we
[1:12:45] are, where we really come from. And that

[1:12:53] be in this world, but Lord, we are set
[1:12:55] to be in heavenly places, oh God, in
[1:12:57] Christ Jesus, oh God. And now we have
[1:12:59] the mind of Christ and know what you
[1:13:02] want done in the word of God. And we
[1:13:04] know that as the prophet has said Lord
[1:13:06] Jesus power Lord without character is
[1:13:09] satanic oh God but power with character
[1:13:12] is fit to rule oh God. And right now we
[1:13:14] know that an end time evangelism Lord is
[1:13:17] shaping and molding your people oh God
[1:13:19] into character oh God so they can be fit
[1:13:22] to rule oh God they can have the power
