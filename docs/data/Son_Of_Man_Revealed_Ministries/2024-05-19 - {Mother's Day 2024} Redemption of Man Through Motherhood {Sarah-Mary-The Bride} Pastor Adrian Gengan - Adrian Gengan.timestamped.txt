[4:51] loving children loving grandchildren and
[4:54] a good life as they continue to serve
[4:56] the Lord God Almighty our Lord Jesus
[4:58] Christ amen amen so we really want to
[5:00] pass our blessings on to mothers this
[5:02] morning amen so let's turn to our Bibles
[5:07] Hallelujah we turn to Proverbs chapter
[5:10] 31 I've got two portions of a message
[5:13] one addressing mom's and then we'll get
[5:14] into the real meat of the message or the
[5:17] heart of the message amen just to
[5:20] encourage you this
[5:21] morning
[5:24] Hallelujah we serve a awesome God we
[5:27] serve a good God so we can come this
[5:29] morning and worship him in spirit and in
[5:31] truth amen there's no other place we can
[5:33] find Refuge or strength but it's in the
[5:35] presence of the Lord amen so Psalms 31
[5:38] let's read from verse
[5:40] 25
[5:44] amen it says strength and honor are a
[5:49] clothing she is confident about the
[5:51] future her mouth is full of wisdom
[5:54] kindly teaching is on her tongue she's
[5:58] Vigilant over the activities of her
[6:00] household and she doesn't eat the food
[6:03] of
[6:04] laziness she opens her mouth with wisdom
[6:08] and the teaching of kindness is on her
[6:09] tongue her children rise up and call her
[6:12] blessed a husband also and he Praises
[6:16] her many women have done excellently but
[6:19] you surpass them all verse 31 it says
[6:23] honor her for all that her hands have
[6:25] done and let her Works bring her praise
[6:27] at The City Gate amen the Lord have
[6:29] bless listen to the reading of his word
[6:30] you may be
[6:31] seated in Isaiah 66 and3 it says as a
[6:35] mother Comforts a child so will I that's
[6:38] God Almighty comfort you amen so we know
[6:42] amen he will never leave us
[6:44] comfortless now there's many things in
[6:46] this life to get sad depressed about
[6:49] Amen in this life and we need comfort
[6:52] amen and God is showing us that his
[6:54] attribute of motherhood amen like a
[6:56] mother's love towards us he himself is
[6:59] is coming to comfort us amen amen so
[7:02] when you're feeling down when you're
[7:03] feeling weary in this life and you feel
[7:06] like you got nowhere to turn to I
[7:08] encourage you to turn to the word of God
[7:10] amen amen I encourage you to turn to
[7:13] prayer amen because there's not many
[7:15] people as mothers that you can turn to
[7:18] yes amen and especially when you have
[7:21] younger children for those that have got
[7:23] older children maybe it's not so
[7:26] difficult but when you have really young
[7:27] children amen some sometimes it feels
[7:30] like the walls are closing in on you and
[7:32] you're getting all the pressure amen and
[7:34] you wonder how you going to make it amen
[7:36] so turn to Jesus quote scriptures I can
[7:39] do all things through Christ who gives
[7:41] me strength amen his strength is perfect
[7:44] when I am weak amen
[7:48] hallelujah now in Psalm 139 133 and 14
[7:51] it says for you form my inward
[7:54] Parts un knitted me together in my
[7:57] mother's Wom
[8:00] now watch David how he's bringing this
[8:02] out he's not saying that my father and
[8:04] my mother came together and it was just
[8:06] a natural scientific
[8:10] process he's attributing this conception
[8:13] to God yes and he's saying you formed my
[8:16] inward Parts you knitted me together in
[8:19] my mother's home amen I praise you for I
[8:22] am fearfully and wonderfully made amen
[8:26] amen every one of us is fearfully and
[8:29] wonderfully
[8:31] made you know SC people who believe in
[8:34] science and these atheists they believe
[8:36] that everything came out of nothing but
[8:38] yet when they're doing studies they want
[8:40] to prove that something came by
[8:42] intelligent design they know that even
[8:44] this computer couldn't have come by
[8:46] nothing there had to be an intelligent
[8:48] mind behind this computer that would
[8:49] think about it and design it amen and if
[8:52] you look at how complex the human body
[8:54] is there had to be an intelligent
[8:56] designer behind it
[8:58] amen thank you Lord L amen hallelujah
[9:01] wonderful are your works so don't ever
[9:03] feel discouraged you know that you are
[9:05] fearfully and wonderfully made amen no
[9:08] matter what people tell you in this life
[9:10] how they attack you and say words
[9:12] against you try to belittle you and tear
[9:15] down your character tear down your
[9:17] spirit you know that you are fearfully
[9:19] and wonderfully
[9:21] made amen especially young people they
[9:24] get bullied at school amen they told
[9:26] they are ugly they told amen they are
[9:28] fat and they told any kind of things to
[9:30] try and crush the human
[9:34] Spirit but you are fearfully and
[9:36] wonderfully
[9:38] made amen wonderful are your Works my
[9:43] soul knows it very
[9:44] well amen so here when we when we go to
[9:48] 2 Timothy 1 and5 the Apostle Paul is
[9:51] telling Timothy here when I look at you
[9:55] my young
[9:56] man I recognize something within you you
[10:00] you have a faith within you and I've
[10:03] seen this Faith
[10:04] before I've seen this faith that was
[10:06] first in your
[10:07] [Music]
[10:09] grandmother and then in your mother
[10:11] Unice your grandmother was Lois your
[10:14] mother is
[10:15] unus but I persuaded that in thee also
[10:20] so faith can be passed down through
[10:23] generations how through teaching amen
[10:26] mom is a fth gospel and it's our role
[10:28] and a duty Beauty because the first four
[10:30] years are given to
[10:33] her before you handle over to the school
[10:35] teacher or him to the school teacher the
[10:38] first four years are the training ground
[10:40] where you have with the
[10:43] child amen those are sacred times
[10:46] because that will be the foundational
[10:47] teachings of the child so I encourage
[10:50] you before you hand them over to the
[10:52] school teacher make sure they are taught
[10:54] the word of God make sure they are
[10:57] singing Sunday school songs make sure
[10:59] they have scripture Memory verses amen
[11:03] teach them the ways of God Amen then
[11:05] what will happen the Bible says train
[11:07] them up in the ways they should go for
[11:09] when they grow older they will not
[11:11] depart from the faith amen amen and
[11:14] that's how generational Faith was passed
[11:17] down yes the faith was so strong in
[11:20] Grandma Lois yes that she taught her
[11:24] daughter Unice yes and Unice raised the
[11:28] son Timothy
[11:29] with the faith amen amen hallelujah and
[11:33] that word UNF faith means a perfect
[11:35] faith I see it in you
[11:37] Timothy amen hallelujah so don't think
[11:40] that you teaching your children is of no
[11:42] effect amen it's having an effect on
[11:44] them thank you Lord amen hallelujah and
[11:47] and never think your children are too
[11:48] old to correct them amen always take
[11:52] them back to the word of God Amen
[11:54] because people can
[11:56] stray but always directing back to the
[11:58] word of God
[11:59] God
[12:01] Amen and the work of moms have a work to
[12:05] do older women if you go to Titus 2 and
[12:13] 3 you'll see within the home within the
[12:16] church life within the home life they
[12:19] have a specific role it says the aged
[12:21] women likewise that they be in Behavior
[12:24] as becometh
[12:25] Holiness not false accuses not giv to
[12:29] much wine teaches of good things
[12:32] amen that they teach the young woman to
[12:35] be
[12:36] sober to love their
[12:39] husbands Amen to love their children to
[12:43] be discreet chased keepers at home good
[12:47] obedient to their own husbands that the
[12:49] word of God be not
[12:52] blasphemed amen hallelujah amen praise
[12:55] the Lord now we find here the prophet is
[12:57] telling us if we go to our first quote
[12:59] there
[12:59] he's telling us that the morals of
[13:03] society have sunk to an alltime law and
[13:06] it started by a gradual
[13:09] desensitization of people's morals
[13:12] because they started to influence them
[13:13] via their
[13:15] songs songs are something people love
[13:18] they like the music but behind the beat
[13:20] is the lyrics and he says all our songs
[13:23] are about women or sex and lust and
[13:27] things like that
[13:31] amen so how are they starting to
[13:34] desensitize you they put it in their
[13:36] songs they put it in their
[13:38] movies first amen it was a int of a kiss
[13:43] then as time goes by as you get
[13:45] desensitized amen they show you the
[13:47] actual
[13:48] kiss then they show you amen these
[13:51] people completely
[13:53] naked why you desensitize to it and then
[13:57] it no longer shocks you
[13:59] right you know like that frog in the
[14:02] water you throw it into hot water it
[14:04] will jump out immediately but if you lay
[14:07] there in the tub and you gradually eat
[14:09] up the
[14:10] water the Frog gets comfortable until
[14:14] the water reaches like boiling point and
[14:16] the frog dies in the water but born
[14:19] again Christians ought not to be
[14:21] consuming the things of this world if
[14:24] there's anybody listening to pop music
[14:26] rock music amen music of the world you
[14:29] ought to change your music you can't
[14:31] claim to be a believer and then feeding
[14:34] off the things of the world you don't
[14:36] realize but it is corrupting your
[14:40] morals so the prophet is saying all look
[14:42] at how it sat it's saying all of our
[14:44] songs amen and then they putting sex on
[14:47] the TV lust and things like that it's
[14:50] now it's no longer on the
[14:51] TV it's there on your
[14:54] phone amen you can access anything on
[14:58] your phone yes right so you ought to be
[15:00] a good Steward and a good manager over
[15:03] what's entrusted to you amen hallelujah
[15:07] we can't corrupt our minds by looking at
[15:09] pornographic material we can't corrupt
[15:12] our minds by listening to songs amen
[15:15] because it's there at your
[15:16] fingertips amen laughing at ungodly
[15:20] jokes amen watching comedy shows that a
[15:23] vulgar yes amen and then we say we have
[15:26] the spirit of Christ but the spirit of
[15:28] Christ the Holy Spirit cannot feed on
[15:30] those things if we are comfortable
[15:33] feeding on those things it shows that we
[15:35] don't have the Holy Spirit and we have
[15:37] another Spirit maybe it's a religious
[15:40] spirit amen amen so he says amen old
[15:45] Hollywood and televisions that
[15:46] everything is pushing out that vulgar
[15:47] and ungodly stuff will go Amen to Old
[15:51] stands new stands and everything else
[15:53] everything is some stripped woman or
[15:55] something that's exactly what it started
[15:57] in the beginning and ending the same way
[16:00] it's a
[16:01] shame he says the backbone of Any Nation
[16:04] is Womanhood motherhood amen when it
[16:07] comes to morals and you break motherhood
[16:09] you broke your
[16:11] nation that is why they went after the
[16:13] woman
[16:14] first with woman's lip amen trying to
[16:18] take her away from a place amen
[16:21] hallelujah so they broke the nation and
[16:23] we got a place today till our woman
[16:26] smoking cigarettes and things like that
[16:28] and drinking whiskey and carrying on
[16:31] it's
[16:32] disgraceful so if you think it's cool
[16:35] it's not it's
[16:37] disgraceful amen amen a woman shouldn't
[16:40] be found doing things like that neither
[16:43] should Born Again Believers Christian
[16:45] men amen hallelujah we've got to
[16:48] maintain the morals and keep it high in
[16:51] this 21st century amen at the end of
[16:54] that seven Church age amen when we enter
[16:57] the bride age we've got to keep the
[16:59] morals and the standards of the word
[17:01] amen we cannot compromise neither can we
[17:03] back down we cannot claim to have the
[17:05] opening of the word and still indulge in
[17:08] those things amen if there's anybody
[17:10] that ought to be somebody where the word
[17:12] is displayed and manifested it ought to
[17:14] be yours and my life
[17:17] amen amen
[17:20] hallelujah now when we are looking for
[17:23] this kind of a woman that's holding up
[17:25] the morals and standards when you're
[17:28] single you are given a choice to find
[17:29] this kind of a woman so the prophet is
[17:32] teaching the young men to try and find
[17:34] the right type of a woman and he's
[17:37] encouraging them because once you go and
[17:39] you marry her it's until death do your
[17:43] part amen you can't leave because you
[17:47] made a wrong choice if we are governed
[17:50] by the word amen we've got to stay with
[17:52] the
[17:52] word
[17:54] hallelujah and he says here
[17:57] Amen in the next quote there he says
[18:00] getting into the core of motherhood and
[18:02] when a man starts to get married the
[18:04] type of girl woman it's more than just
[18:08] to look at
[18:09] Beauty you got to get somebody both soul
[18:12] and body joined together somebody that's
[18:15] really going to be your friend and pal
[18:18] that will stick with you through thick
[18:20] and
[18:21] thin even when your body is going
[18:24] through thick and thin you got to find
[18:26] somebody who can stick with you through
[18:28] sick and
[18:30] thin amen praise the Lord not leave you
[18:33] when the our times come because the V of
[18:36] the altar ah in riches in poverty as in
[18:40] wealth in sickness as in health until
[18:43] death do us part you find the morels of
[18:47] people today when their husband gets
[18:49] sick they say oh it's too difficult for
[18:51] me I'm a young woman I can't take care
[18:53] of this man so they divorce him and they
[18:55] go find somebody else
[18:58] amen as we see time progressing it's
[19:01] harder to find people commit to one
[19:03] another because the word of God is not
[19:06] their Foundation yes amen amen they've
[19:09] settled for sitcoms and and movies and
[19:11] and and all of these things amen where
[19:13] they see it in the
[19:15] movies even before people get married
[19:17] they're sleeping around with Partners
[19:20] they've made that cool in the movies
[19:22] they think it's cool for you to sleep
[19:24] around while you're in high school while
[19:25] you're in school while you're in college
[19:27] it is not school amen amen the Bible
[19:29] condemns it the Bible does not condone
[19:32] it come on say Amen
[19:35] somebody amen we ought not to be a bunch
[19:37] of compromisers we ought to stand for
[19:40] truth the Bible doesn't amen condone you

[19:45] get married committing
[19:47] fornication amen
[19:50] hallelujah and and you better be careful

[21:08] your plan and your purpose and you find
[21:10] a man who loves the Lord more than he
[21:13] loves you you find a man who loves the
[21:15] word of God more than he loves you

[21:54] girl at least the Hindu girl knows
[21:56] nothing about Christianity The Jezebel
[21:58] denominational girl wants to wear pants

[22:02] believes the word of God and God loves
[22:04] everyone and he doesn't judge

[22:36] you after you get married and there's
[22:37] nothing you can do about

[22:49] Lord is the only way
[22:54] out the guy is in a deep sleep you
[22:56] checking him out to see if he's
[22:57] breathing or not
[22:59] making sure now amen hallelujah amen
[23:04] we're making light of it now but these
[23:05] are serious
[23:07] matters amen the kind of woman you want
[23:09] to raise your children the kind of home
[23:12] you're going to
[23:14] have amen so what he says you want
[23:17] somebody who will stick with you through
[23:18] thick and thin he says the kind of woman
[23:20] you know in choosing of a bride will
[23:22] reflect your character no matter what a
[23:24] man professes to be he says watch what
[23:27] he marries it reflects his
[23:29] character amen praise the Lord now the
[23:32] we're talking about morals here and the
[23:34] prophet gives us two examples which I'll
[23:35] go through very quickly one he brings a
[23:37] story about the Apostle and he shows you
[23:40] how the Apostle came and lay at his door
[23:43] outside his home and it had a sick baby
[23:46] it had full of babies but there was one
[23:48] that had a broken collar bone and it was
[23:51] like the Hound was open and there was
[23:53] like things growing there and worms
[23:55] eating it but the mother was sitting
[23:57] there and people he started to ask
[24:00] people advice what he should do some
[24:01] were saying kill it amen but the prophet
[24:05] waited and here we pick it up from here
[24:08] and the prophet is saying day had come
[24:09] old theum laying there I went back
[24:12] thought oh god there she is that o son
[24:14] laying right at my step started walking
[24:16] back through the door the Blessed Holy
[24:19] Spirit stopped me said you called her a
[24:21] lady you took up for her for being a
[24:24] real mother and I sent her to your house
[24:27] to be prayed
[24:28] for amen and you're letting her lay
[24:31] there like a woman at your
[24:33] doorstep amen the prophet is trying to
[24:36] show you the morals of animal life amen
[24:38] is greater than a human life because
[24:42] mothers today don't value their children
[24:44] amen they'll take them and wrap them up
[24:46] and throw them in a garbage
[24:50] can you know there was a case somewhere
[24:52] Joselyn Smith someone in Cape Town
[24:54] mother sold them sold the
[24:57] child grow up child sold him sex
[25:01] trafficking for how much
[25:05] 20,000 that's how much they value
[25:10] life said God for now the prophet is
[25:13] saying I said God forgive your stupid
[25:15] servant I walked out there and said God
[25:17] if you are merciful enough to deal with
[25:19] a dumb animal who has got lady enough
[25:21] about her to raise our babies to send an
[25:24] ignorant Apostle to my doorstep to be
[25:26] prayed for oh God he he the apum in
[25:29] Jesus name I
[25:30] pray he says the old apum turned over
[25:33] and looked at me raised up on her feet
[25:36] picked up her babies and put them in
[25:38] there as if to Bow her head and say
[25:40] thank you and took off to the woods
[25:42] rejoicing she knows a lot more than
[25:45] preachers do sometimes She'll follow the
[25:47] leading of the Holy
[25:48] Spirit if God can deal with a apostle
[25:51] how much could he deal with a human no
[25:54] uncertain sound about that God uses
[25:56] animal to teach services sure
[26:00] does Amen then you know the other story
[26:02] about the deer and the fa amen how this
[26:06] Cru arted Hunter the prophet was hunting
[26:08] with him and he got a whistle that when
[26:10] he blew the whistle it sounded like that
[26:13] of a f a little deer bleeding crying out
[26:16] for mother and he was using this thing
[26:19] to trap the mother and when he blew this
[26:21] whistle the mother came out in the open
[26:25] remember they were hunting now they were
[26:26] going to shoot the deer
[26:28] [Music]
[26:32] amen so now the prophet said that he he
[26:35] blew the Cru outed man blew this whistle
[26:37] and this deer came out and the prophet
[26:39] says oh I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't
[26:41] bear to look at it so I turned away and
[26:44] this person told him you chicken outed
[26:47] preacher and now we'll pick it up here
[26:49] he says well look if I was hungry and I
[26:51] wanted one of the SWS I believe God will
[26:53] let me have it but just to shoot it just
[26:55] to act smart he'll full a wagon up and
[27:00] he went and made him a call some kind of
[27:02] a whistle and could Blow That Whistle
[27:04] and sound just exactly like a fa
[27:07] calling so he says I'm going to go to
[27:09] the next paragraph
[27:11] there 111 one day he stood back in the
[27:14] bushes he had took a hold of this
[27:16] whistle and he screamed and it sounded
[27:18] like a little F crying and just as he
[27:20] did that a beautiful do stuck a head out
[27:22] came stomping out we could see her big
[27:24] brown eyes looking she was startled she
[27:27] was looking around the hunter raised
[27:29] pulled down his rifle to shoot the
[27:32] door the door seen the hunter you know
[27:34] what but the scream of that for she
[27:36] didn't notice the gun she was looking
[27:38] for that baby it was in trouble you know
[27:41] that display of real motherhood and
[27:42] mother love that she' face that gun in
[27:44] the face for death looking in at that
[27:47] muzzle of that gun you know what that
[27:50] displays was so great it got next to him
[27:53] he threw down his gun he ran back and
[27:55] grabbed me around my arm and he said
[27:57] Billy pray for me I had enough of this
[28:00] when he seen that display of mother
[28:05] heroism he says oh the world sees the
[28:08] display of the love of God and a gallant
[28:10] in our human heart what a difference it
[28:12] will be when we let the dove of God come
[28:15] into our hearts and gentle us make us
[28:18] Meek he says there in that brush ala
[28:20] back there me standing there praying for
[28:22] that old boy I led him to the Lord Jesus
[28:25] from then on he was a good clean Hunter
[28:28] amen so what the prophet is telling us
[28:30] we can learn from
[28:32] nature amen how they take care of their
[28:35] young ones yes amen praise the Lord and
[28:39] he you know he goes on and on I I don't
[28:41] have time to go into all of that but he
[28:42] goes on and on and then he tells you how
[28:45] they don't want to have children anymore
[28:47] because it'll just trigger their shape
[28:49] their body therefore we honor women who
[28:52] are willing to sacrifice their figure
[28:55] yeah for children amen amen
[28:59] hallelujah they're not interested in
[29:01] that the baby is more sacred than their
[29:04] body amen hallelujah
[29:08] am so he says that they they rather
[29:10] don't want to have children so they
[29:12] rather take a pet poodle miniature
[29:15] poodle one teacups they call it teacup
[29:17] poodle and they spend more money over
[29:19] the teacup poodle than they were a
[29:22] child and you see how they cry when the
[29:24] dog die they have funeral they have
[29:27] coffin
[29:28] they have
[29:31] everything amen what are they trying to
[29:34] do substitute the god-given nature and
[29:37] Instinct for motherhood trying to fulf
[29:40] with something else amen now yes to the
[29:44] husbands yes to me yes to everyone of us
[29:47] he says but now a good woman is a jewel
[29:50] in a man's
[29:52] Crown
[29:55] amen are any other side amen amen
[30:01] I thought I was hearing like you know
[30:03] mono
[30:04] side but a good woman is a jewel in a
[30:06] man's
[30:09] Crown she should be honored my mother's
[30:13] a woman my wife is and they're lovely
[30:16] how many of you
[30:17] agree amen I've got thousands of
[30:20] Christian sisters who are highly respect
[30:23] if they can respect what God made them a
[30:25] motherhood and a real queen amen you see
[30:28] we call our daughters Queen but you can
[30:30] see who the real queen is
[30:33] amen a real queen that's all right she's
[30:38] one of the best things that God could
[30:39] give a man and all the men
[30:42] says and all the married men said
[30:47] amen she's one of the best things that
[30:49] God could give a man was a wife besides
[30:52] salvation a man is the best thing if she
[30:56] is a good wife but if she is and Solomon
[30:59] said a good woman is a jewel in a man's
[31:01] Crown but an honorary one no good one is
[31:04] water in his blood that's right it's the
[31:07] worst thing can happen so a good woman
[31:09] if you got a good wife brother you ought
[31:11] to respect her with the highest that's
[31:13] right you should do that a real woman
[31:16] and children if you got a real mother
[31:18] that stays home and tries to take care
[31:20] of you keeping your clothes clean sends
[31:22] you to school teaching you about Jesus
[31:24] you should honor that sweet old mother
[31:26] with all that's in you
[31:29] everybody listening autum you're
[31:31] listening you're reading
[31:34] here all the children reading if you've
[31:37] got a
[31:38] mother that stays at home tries to take
[31:40] care of you keep your clothes clean
[31:42] sends you to school teaching you about
[31:44] Jesus you should honor that sweet old
[31:45] mother with all that's in
[31:47] you you should respect that woman yes
[31:50] sir because she's a real mother
[31:54] amen
[31:56] hallelujah you know generally topics
[31:58] like this the people are not interested
[32:00] cuz the men feel intimidated
[32:02] now you forcing me now we're not forcing
[32:06] you we're teaching you the word of God
[32:09] amen amen hallelujah so if you are not
[32:12] aligned now is the time to
[32:14] align amen hallelujah praise the
[32:18] Lord I tell you the
[32:22] thoughts we finished it right yeah I
[32:25] tell you the thoughts of a good
[32:27] Christian mother is a treasure to the
[32:29] human heart that's never forgotten God
[32:31] give us more mothers that will take
[32:32] their children instead of trying to
[32:34] teach them tap dancing and something to
[32:36] ruin and wreck their life will read the
[32:38] stories of the Bible to them and tell
[32:40] them of the god of heaven and peace God
[32:43] knows that we need that above all things
[32:46] now for motherhood can all the mothers
[32:49] say amen for that am amen hallelujah
[32:53] praise the Lord amen we got to close
[32:54] this part now amen hallelujah
[32:59] maybe we can just go through this in the
[33:01] in the quote six there the prophet is
[33:03] talking about sister B Sister B was a
[33:05] woman who just passed on and the prophet
[33:07] is remembering her and how she gave a
[33:10] happy marriage to the husband and was
[33:11] expression of a loyal wife made a home
[33:13] for the children amen even when our
[33:16] times came she put food on the table
[33:18] amen feed the hungry mouths many of you
[33:20] can testify to that even though your
[33:23] mothers may have not been Christian
[33:24] woman may have not been in the message
[33:26] real rugged oldfashioned woman amen fed
[33:29] the
[33:30] children even if they went hungry they
[33:32] fed their children amen hallelujah so in
[33:36] 59 paragraph there he says a never
[33:38] failing plea for her children I don't
[33:41] believe I ever met or left her without
[33:43] her asking a request for those
[33:47] children that showed real motherhood
[33:50] knowing that life is merely a dream or a
[33:52] preparation place for children she
[33:55] wanted to meet them in a land Beyond
[33:58] where there would be no more hard times
[34:00] she constantly would say to me she call
[34:02] me brother bully she would say brother
[34:04] bully pray for my
[34:06] children oh I remember Sister
[34:09] Chinta pray for my
[34:14] children amen none of them will be lost
[34:18] if that isn't expressing real motherhood
[34:20] a mother who is interested in a children
[34:22] interested in her neighbors interested
[34:24] in a husband a loved one it's God in the
[34:27] woman expressing Eternal things that's
[34:30] the point I wanted to drive there when
[34:32] you see these attributes flowing out of
[34:34] a woman it's God in a woman expressing
[34:37] Eternal
[34:38] things
[34:40] amen amen now in closing this part of it
[34:44] I want to tell you that the prophet says
[34:45] in the message invisible Union of the
[34:47] Bride he says there were three sacred
[34:49] virtues given to
[34:51] women he says notice sacred virtue
[34:55] sacred Womanhood sac
[34:58] motherhood honor her husband what a
[35:01] sacred trust what a responsibility to a
[35:04] woman now see why she's a type of the
[35:07] church which had the same responsibility
[35:11] as a woman had a sacred responsibility
[35:13] to her motherhood to her virtues to her
[35:16] husband the church has a sacred
[35:19] responsibility to prayer and to the
[35:21] [Music]
[35:23] word if we are saying we're in the body
[35:26] of Christ we have a sacred
[35:27] responsibility to prayer we have a
[35:30] sacred responsibility to the
[35:35] word he says and to Christ just the same
[35:39] as the woman as amen praise the Lord now
[35:42] in talking about children I got two
[35:44] women in mind that come to my mind now
[35:47] and one of them was
[35:49] AA remember
[35:51] AA even though aan was gone the way of
[35:55] the world and had contracted a veneral
[35:58] disease sexually transmitted
[36:02] disease mother's love for the
[36:05] son was still there
[36:08] amen and she didn't know anything about
[36:10] a message she didn't know anything about
[36:13] a prophet but she got to praying
[36:16] amen amen what am i showing you it's not
[36:20] exclusive for message Believers if
[36:22] somebody is sincere before the Lord God
[36:24] will send a message believer their way
[36:26] as a former of an answer and yeah the
[36:29] prophet is on his own agenda on his own
[36:31] schedule on a airplane going his way but
[36:35] a mother's sincere prayer for a son stop
[36:38] the airplane God had created a storm
[36:41] that would stop the
[36:42] airplane and make him walk through the
[36:44] streets was it Chicago make him walk
[36:48] through the streets until he comes to
[36:50] the front porch or front place of This

[38:03] that way your Earthly father but you can

[38:08] way say Lord I'm seeking your will and
[38:10] your plan for this won't you reveal it
[38:12] to me bring it to
[38:14] pass amen say Lord I am your Isaac where

[38:48] then I said two women right that was one
[38:51] the next one was at you right oh yes can
[38:53] you
[38:55] imagine third pool anointing
[38:58] can ask anything you
[39:01] want anything you want nothing will be
[39:04] withheld from this woman because she
[39:06] connected with the faith of the
[39:08] prophet and anything you want she

[39:13] salvation of my two boys amen women

[39:25] of God can reach down amen the heart of

[39:35] would have asked for something
[39:37] else but that you
[39:40] right ask for the Salvation of her two
[39:43] boys amen praise the Lord that's my
[39:46] first message amen praise the Lord I
[39:48] will now go into my second message amen

[39:53] praise the Lord amen see I prepared two
[39:55] sermons this morning amen praise the
[39:58] Lord that was to encourage our mothers

[40:23] to you and my Mother's Day
[40:25] message for now some of you come really
[40:28] hungry some of you want meat amen so
[40:32] from now till we close the service we
[40:35] will focus on this
[40:39] thought that when man fell he needed to
[40:41] be
[40:43] redeemed and God would use
[40:46] motherhood to redeem
[40:50] men yes there's no other way you would
[40:53] redeem man but he's got to come through
[40:56] motherhood
[40:57] amen so Redemption of man through
[41:00] motherhood is what I'm talking about now
[41:02] we find here in the first in the book of
[41:05] in the Book of Matthew the First Gospel
[41:07] there amen praise the Lord greet your
[41:10] brother and sister somebody say God
[41:11] bless you amen you all looking tense and
[41:13] nervous you feel like you got tricked

[41:21] sermons you're feeling
[41:23] uneasy settle down we still in our time
[41:26] amen amen praise the Lord this is the
[41:28] heart of the message now that was my
[41:30] background for
[41:31] motherhood but Redemption of man through
[41:34] motherhood we find in the gospel of
[41:36] Matthew the Bible includes five wom in
[41:38] the genealogy of
[41:41] Jesus five being Grace
[41:44] amen the grace of
[41:48] God now if we are so affected by what
[41:51] Eve did in the Garden of Eden shouldn't
[41:53] we be affected by what Mary Did In The
[41:55] Book of Luke
[41:58] come on
[41:59] now you want to lay all the blame on Eve
[42:03] but you don't want to give any
[42:04] recognition to Mary amen
[42:07] [Laughter]
[42:09] amen blessed are thou amongst all women
[42:12] amen for thou are highly
[42:15] favored said the
[42:18] angel as much as Eve let down the human
[42:21] race Mary provided a
[42:24] body amen
[42:28] the fall through one but the Redemption
[42:30] through
[42:31] another amen amen hallelujah so we find
[42:35] it's it's there in the book amen
[42:37] hallelujah of Matthew you'll find there
[42:39] BBA you'll find Ruth mentioned you'll
[42:42] find Rab mention you say I don't
[42:44] remember good stories about this
[42:47] woman RAB how come God can use her God
[42:51] will use you as
[42:52] well your life is not too far gone that
[42:55] God can't use you when you are cleansed
[42:57] by the blood your slate is clean amen
[43:00] though your SK sins be as Scarlet they
[43:02] are white as snow because the blood of
[43:04] Jesus cleanses you and we have been
[43:07] taught that justification is not just
[43:09] that just shall live by faith like
[43:11] Luther's message justifications means
[43:13] you are forgiven as though you've never
[43:15] done it in the first
[43:19] place that's the loose and TI up by
[43:22] William Mari and brandham
[43:25] amen you know what that means means you
[43:27] are Justified amen you've never done it
[43:30] in the first place amen thank you Lord
[43:34] amen
[43:35] RAB married to what's his name salmon
[43:39] amen and
[43:40] Tomar went in
[43:43] Disguise to sleep with a
[43:46] father-in-law but the scepter shall not
[43:48] depart from Judah amen and God used it
[43:51] amen to bring the lineage
[43:53] forth and then there's
[43:55] Mary 5 in that genealogy amen hallelujah
[43:59] we go quickly now to Genesis chter 3 to
[44:02] see the fall there and why I'm I'm doing
[44:05] this for a reason also for repetition so
[44:08] that the young people also understand
[44:10] that man fell man is not in his original
[44:13] estate the weak kind of man you see is
[44:16] struggling to live is not the man that
[44:18] God designed initially yes man fell
[44:21] because of
[44:22] sin man was a ruler of the earth amen
[44:25] man could speak yes young ones if there
[44:28] was a mountain here and the mountain was
[44:31] in the man's way and he didn't want the
[44:34] mountain there you know women like like
[44:36] to rearrange stuff and maybe one day Eve
[44:38] would come to Adam and say I don't like
[44:40] that mountain is obstructing my view
[44:43] Adam could go and say Mountain be thou
[44:45] moved over there that's the authority
[44:49] that's our ought to be
[44:51] State when God made Man In His Image and
[44:54] likeness he's not going to make an
[44:55] inferior type of a man that man must
[44:57] speak like God Amen that man must have
[45:00] authority over the Earth that man must
[45:02] have dominion over the Earth so we find
[45:04] here in Genesis 3:15 it says I will
[45:08] put talking to the serpent now this is
[45:11] after the
[45:12] fall I will put enity between thee and
[45:14] the woman and between thy seed and her
[45:17] seed that's what we want to focus on now
[45:20] the woman is's going to have a seed so
[45:23] God is just detailing his Plan of
[45:25] Redemption straight away but talking
[45:27] about
[45:29] motherhood that the woman is going to
[45:31] have a
[45:34] child and that child shall bruise thy
[45:37] head and thou shallal bruise his
[45:41] heel you see Satan thought he was
[45:43] hitting at the heart of Jesus but he was
[45:46] only bruising his
[45:50] heel now there comes a punishment in
[45:52] verse 16 and unto the woman he said I
[45:55] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[45:58] conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring
[46:00] forth children and thy desire shall be
[46:02] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[46:05] thee and unto Adam he said because thou
[46:07] had hearkened unto the voice of thy wife
[46:10] and had eaten of the tree which I
[46:12] commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat
[46:14] of it cursed is the ground for thy
[46:17] sake in sorrow Thou shalt eat of it all
[46:20] the days of thy
[46:22] life thorns and thisle shall it bring
[46:24] forth to thee you see why is Crown was a
[46:27] thorn he took the curse upon
[46:30] himself thorns and thistles shall it
[46:32] bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat
[46:35] the herb of the field in the sweat of
[46:37] thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou
[46:39] return unto the ground that's why we
[46:42] struggle to
[46:45] live for out of it was thou taken for
[46:48] dust Thou Art and through dust shalt
[46:51] thou return and Adam called his wife's
[46:53] name Eve because she was the mother of
[46:56] all living
[46:58] so if you and I are to
[47:00] trace our
[47:02] genealogy trace our ancestry we will all
[47:06] land up back with mother with Eve being
[47:08] our
[47:10] mother hello yes we would all end up
[47:13] with Adam being our father and Eve being
[47:16] our mother so I don't know why we don't
[47:18] like one another we all brothers and
[47:20] sisters amen amen
[47:24] hallelujah there's only one
[47:30] bloodline
[47:32] amen so now because what Eve did now
[47:35] remember Eve did not want to do
[47:39] that Eve got
[47:41] deceived because the serpent was settle
[47:44] amen she got deceived into doing what
[47:47] she
[47:49] did amen so that's the first woman that
[47:52] we're looking at was Eve then we go now
[47:55] and we look when God chooses another man
[47:59] Abraham he doesn't choose him in the
[48:01] prime of his
[48:02] life he choose him when he's 75 years
[48:06] old you think God wanting to choose
[48:08] another man to work a plan through and
[48:10] choose this nation and say out of your
[48:12] seed shall come forth a
[48:15] people he choose him in the Brilliance
[48:17] of his youth when his wife is Young and
[48:20] can have
[48:21] children but God's timing is not
[48:23] according to your timing is what I'm
[48:25] trying to tell you amen you can't rush
[48:27] God's timing for your life
[48:31] yes so don't move like Sarah now and get
[48:34] frustrated with
[48:36] God and the Lord appeared unto him in
[48:38] the plains of memory he sat in the tent
[48:40] Door In the Heat of the day and he lift
[48:42] up his eyes and looked and three men
[48:44] stood by him and when he saw them he ran
[48:46] to meet them from the tent door bowed
[48:49] himself to the ground and said my Lord
[48:51] if now I have found favor in thy sight
[48:53] pass not away why am I reading this this
[48:56] is typing the seen in Revelation
[49:00] 10 the angel coming
[49:02] down to connect with an end time woman
[49:05] amen must bring forth the Manchild in
[49:08] this
[49:09] hour yeah he's coming to connect with
[49:11] Abraham
[49:14] now let a little water I pray you be
[49:16] feted wash your feet rest yourself under
[49:19] the tree and I will fetch a morcel of
[49:22] bread and comfort to your hearts after
[49:24] that you pass on for therefore are you
[49:27] come are you come to your servant and
[49:30] they said so do as thou has said now
[49:33] watch this I want you to notice
[49:35] something
[49:37] here they are now if I'm correct Abraham
[49:41] is 99 years old and Sarah is 89 years
[49:45] old the prophet says she's an older
[49:48] woman
[49:50] now Abraham left his land at 75 yes amen
[49:56] and Sarah by this time was Fed Up of
[50:00] hearing that she was going to have a
[50:05] child generally women who can't have
[50:08] children go through
[50:12] depression and if they can't handle it
[50:14] life they can't handle it correctly they
[50:17] get
[50:18] bitter they'll get
[50:22] bitter and Sarah wasn't the best of
[50:24] natures
[50:27] if you follow the life of Sarah She
[50:31] chased a servant
[50:37] girl you got to read between the lines
[50:39] now amen and pick up the nature and
[50:42] character She chased a young mother with
[50:45] a
[50:48] child
[50:50] amen so the setting is coming now at the
[50:53] time when Sarah is aged
[50:58] when she thinks the promises of the word
[50:59] don't apply to her I'm saying this for a
[51:02] reason in the specific
[51:03] way because the message Community has
[51:05] become
[51:08] aged and the thing the promises and
[51:10] everything the prophet spoke about don't
[51:12] apply to them they feel like they can't
[51:14] produce
[51:17] this you're putting an unrealistic
[51:20] expectation on me my body is old I'm
[51:24] aged where are the m from the' 70s that
[51:28] came out in this
[51:30] message are they still with the same
[51:32] Vigor to see themselves as a super
[51:33] Church super race amen or do they feel
[51:40] aged
[51:42] Amen to see the
[51:44] promise of God come to pass in their own
[51:47] lives amen we reading about Sarah as a
[51:49] type now but she couldn't see herself as
[51:52] bringing forth this
[51:54] child now if you notice
[51:57] here what Abraham does when he goes to
[52:01] her the story is in the details there
[52:04] amen
[52:05] hallelujah I want you to get a a quote
[52:08] for me brother Joshua amen praise the
[52:10] Lord
[52:14] amen
[52:25] amen is there any anything too hard for
[52:27] the Lord preach 1960 March 28 from
[52:32] paragraph
[52:34] 22 let's just read the scripture as well
[52:36] while he's looking for it amen and
[52:39] Abraham ased into the tent unto
[52:42] Sarah now picture your home life your
[52:44] home setting women don't like
[52:47] unannounced
[52:52] visitors Sarah was no different
[52:55] especially an 80 year 89 old
[52:59] woman if you didn't catch it already she
[53:02] never came
[53:04] out even the Lord had to ask where is
[53:07] Sarah your
[53:09] wife the prophet says she was a little
[53:11] upset that
[53:13] day she was
[53:15] [Music]
[53:17] fuss she didn't want to hear anything
[53:19] about
[53:20] visitors that's why you see Abraham
[53:22] running through the kettle trying to
[53:23] find a
[53:24] kid and he goes to her he tells her
[53:27] trying to buttt up honey please I got
[53:28] visitors here please make some
[53:31] cakes he's
[53:34] like who these people now came
[53:37] here
[53:40] unannounced unannounced in
[53:42] 1963 who just coming to put an
[53:45] expectation upon me
[53:48] amen amen amen

[55:29] to be found with
[55:34] hospitality before them he stood by them
[55:36] under the tree and they did

[57:31] that's going to make you frustrated with
[57:33] one
[57:34] another yes you can't be fighting in the
[57:37] car and then suddenly come here put your
[57:38] Halo

[57:42] service you're going to be in an awful
[57:45] mood he says you don't see things when
[57:47] you come to church in that kind of a
[57:49] mood you just no need of trying
[57:53] it amen
[57:56] you just might as well have stayed
[57:58] home how many of you felt that way if we
[58:01] got honest people yet sometimes you feel
[58:04] I was upset now I didn't get anything
[58:05] out of the service but it wasn't
[58:07] anything to do with the
[58:08] preacher wasn't anything to do with your
[58:10] brother or sister sitting next to you
[58:12] just that you were not prepared for the
[58:17] service you might as well have stayed
[58:19] home you won't get nothing out of it go
[58:21] home see he's even telling you go home
[58:30] when you come to church come pray
[58:33] up come in the atmosphere come expecting
[58:37] Jesus amen Abraham knew the time of the
[58:40] promise was coming close it had to be he
[58:43] was 100 years old he was expecting it
[58:44] any time he watched every minute when he
[58:47] run in told Sarah this I believe is the
[58:49] day of our visitation she kind she kind
[58:52] of looked at him with them big eyes and
[58:54] thought well Abraham you've said that a
[58:56] long time today's woman will be
[59:04] like how long you telling me same
[59:08] [Music]
[59:11] thing if God said so then when the angel
[59:14] took his chair and leaned back he said
[59:15] Abraham seeing that you have got favor
[59:17] with God that you are an heir of the
[59:19] world you're going to be father of many
[59:21] nations you believe that since you are
[59:23] 65 75 years old and otherwise you waited
[59:27] for this promised Child by Sarah I'm not
[59:29] going to keep this from you what I'm

[59:52] dropping kindly halfway in an upset mood
[59:54] from a condition that morning she
[59:56] thought in her heart now isn't that a
[59:57] silly
[59:59] thing so maybe people think that way
[1:00:01] when the preachers are preaching and
[1:00:02] telling you need to come into a stat of
[1:00:04] a perfect man you're going to be a super
[1:00:06] race you're going to be a super Church

[1:01:07] to see it if you don't watch Friends the
[1:01:10] church is going to fail to see
[1:01:12] it let's not look for church airos and
[1:01:15] new dresses let's look for the Holy
[1:01:17] Spirit to come in the Supernatural and
[1:01:19] raise some things the church don't need
[1:01:22] a face lift it needs a birth the Holy
[1:01:24] Ghost to come back into the church bring
[1:01:26] back people and that believes in the
[1:01:28] Supernatural holds and waiting for the
[1:01:31] coming of the Lord as if it might be an
[1:01:33] any hour living in them conditions
[1:01:39] amen yes she was in that shape saying
[1:01:42] how could that happen in our modern time
[1:01:45] how could it happen in my condition but
[1:01:47] it happened just the same Abraham out
[1:01:49] there waiting with anticipation it
[1:01:51] wasn't made known to her it was made
[1:01:53] known to them that was looking for it
[1:01:55] that's way it comes yet to those who are
[1:01:57] looking so he was watching Abraham

[1:02:28] she was looking at Lot's wife how she

[1:02:35] progressing sometimes we're too much
[1:02:37] frustrated about the fellow the other
[1:02:39] fellow that's got the biggest
[1:02:40] denomination his congregation dresses
[1:02:42] better than mine they got a bigger
[1:02:44] Church down the corner what difference

[1:04:02] Abraham for we are the bride of Christ
[1:04:04] and we people who's born of the spirit

[1:13:19] of the true seed of the word God will

[1:13:49] to get excited yes that's

[1:14:00] Creeds or
[1:14:01] dogmas by and through the members of the
[1:14:04] Bride will be fulfilled all that was
[1:14:06] promised of God to be made manifest in
[1:14:09] the Virgin
[1:14:12] amen
[1:14:14] right then he goes on to say the Word of
[1:14:17] Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that
[1:14:20] Word of Promise was he himself to be
[1:14:22] made manifest
[1:14:28] God was made manifest he himself acted
[1:14:29] at that time and fulfilled his own Word
[1:14:31] of Promise in the Virgin it was an angel
[1:14:34] that had brought her the message but
[1:14:36] that a but the Angel's message was the
[1:14:38] word of God Isaiah 9:6 right amen then
[1:14:43] he quotes that he fulfilled at the time
[1:14:45] all that was written of him because she
[1:14:47] accepted his word to her the members now
[1:14:51] he's talking back to us now the members
[1:14:53] of the Virgin bride will love him him
[1:14:55] and they will have his potentials my God
[1:14:59] is packed with potentials and this
[1:15:01] virgin bride will have his potentials oh

[1:15:23] for he is their head and all powers
[1:15:25] belong to him they are subject to him as
[1:15:28] members of our bodies are
[1:15:30] subject subject to our heads he says
[1:15:33] notice the harmony of the Father's son
[1:15:35] Jesus never did anything until it was
[1:15:36] first showed to him of the father this
[1:15:39] harmony is now to exist between the
[1:15:41] groom and his bride he shows her his
[1:15:43] Word of Life she receives it she never
[1:15:45] doubts it therefore nothing can harm her
[1:15:48] not even death yes
[1:15:52] amen then he goes on to say yeah there
[1:15:55] is a secret of it the word is in the
[1:15:56] bride as it was in Mary the bride has a
[1:15:58] mind of Christ for she knows what he
[1:16:00] wants done with the word she performs
[1:16:02] the command of the word in the name for
[1:16:04] she has thus sayth the Lord amen
[1:16:07] hallelujah those in the bride will do
[1:16:09] only his will no one can make them do
[1:16:10] otherwise they have that say the Lord
[1:16:12] who they keep still now I'm trying to
[1:16:15] get to a point
[1:16:17] you right they know it has to be God in
[1:16:20] them doing the works amen this is where
[1:16:23] I want to get to for fulfilling his own
[1:16:25] word he did not complete all his work
[1:16:29] while in his Earthly
[1:16:32] Ministry
[1:16:34] amen amen amen the prophet is wrong
[1:16:39] Jesus did it
[1:16:41] all what is he saying he did not
[1:16:46] complete his all his work while in his
[1:16:49] Earthly Ministry so now he works in and
[1:16:53] through the bride
[1:16:56] amen Sarah are you
[1:16:58] moaning Sarah do you think you're too
[1:17:00] old
[1:17:02] Sarah not just s I'm
[1:17:07] screaming he walks in and through the
[1:17:11] bride she knows that for it was not yet
[1:17:15] time listen carefully it was not yet
[1:17:18] time for him to do certain things that
[1:17:22] he must now do yes
[1:17:26] amen but he will now fulfill through the
[1:17:29] bride that work which he left for this
[1:17:33] specific amen time amen yes Lord so
[1:17:37] maybe you waited 25 years
[1:17:42] Sarah maybe your life was built Mary
[1:17:44] must have wondered about a strange and
[1:17:46] misunderstood life but the time has come
[1:17:49] now when you must fulfill all of the
[1:17:51] word amen amen hallelujah amen amen the
[1:17:55] time has come now when you must fulfill
[1:17:57] all of the
[1:17:58] word hallelujah praise the Lord so man
[1:18:02] fell by a woman and man is redeemed
[1:18:05] Again by God injecting himself through a
[1:18:07] through the human race through a woman
[1:18:10] so a woman who would align to God's plan
[1:18:13] for
[1:18:14] Redemption amen
[1:18:18] hallelujah we know that Isaac was the
[1:18:20] type of Christ he was the promised son
[1:18:22] and Christ was a royal son his mother
[1:18:24] was Barren and unfruitful she was
[1:18:26] lacking in the knowledge of God you know
[1:18:29] I'm inan second Peter 2 then now second
[1:18:31] Peter 3 amen if this things be in you
[1:18:34] you shall neither be baren nor
[1:18:35] unfruitful but Sarah was baren and
[1:18:38] unfruitful God descends to change
[1:18:41] Sarah's position and an Outlook of Faith
[1:18:44] that's what he did in Revelation 10 now
[1:18:46] he comes to change the bridal position
[1:18:49] he comes to change the position of your
[1:18:51] faith amen God descends to change
[1:18:54] Sarah's position our levels of Faith are
[1:18:56] really low so he descends to give a
[1:18:58] perfect Faith amen yes his Plan of
[1:19:02] Redemption must move along and he needs
[1:19:03] Sarah to believe his word in order to
[1:19:06] have a
[1:19:08] body that he can bring Isaac through 25
[1:19:12] years of pass faith is decreasing 60
[1:19:15] years of pass in the message faith is
[1:19:20] decreasing amen but faith is strong in
[1:19:23] Abraham
[1:19:26] amen doesn't matter what's going on in
[1:19:28] your life the promise of God's word and
[1:19:30] his plan for your life must come to pass
[1:19:32] God now if you pay attention to Genesis
[1:19:35] 18 God won't leave you faithless and
[1:19:37] wavering in your faith he will come down
[1:19:40] and you will speak to you like he's
[1:19:41] speaking to you this morning amen
[1:19:43] telling you snap out of your condition
[1:19:45] you have been chosen of God
[1:19:47] amen amen the testing of your faith
[1:19:50] worketh patience and when patience has
[1:19:52] it perfect work you will be perfect one
[1:19:54] in nothing you know that's all scripture
[1:19:56] so what does Sarah do Sarah aligns
[1:19:58] herself to the thinking of the Angel to
[1:20:01] the thinking of God and then the Bible
[1:20:04] if you read Hebrews 11:11 Sarah judged
[1:20:07] him faithful after the Angel's word she
[1:20:10] changes of mind she has perfect Faith
[1:20:13] she judges him faithful amen amen Sarah
[1:20:16] Laughs Again when she brings forth a
[1:20:17] child amen she the first time she
[1:20:20] laughed it was a Heart full of mockery
[1:20:22] amen she was not believing anything she
[1:20:24] could not see yourself as having a child
[1:20:27] I want you to see yourself as having a
[1:20:29] child bringing forth the man Christ yes
[1:20:32] see yourself as bringing forth the Life
[1:20:34] of Christ yes see yourself as doing the
[1:20:36] Greater Works amen see yourself as
[1:20:38] speaking the word yes
[1:20:42] Lord see
[1:20:44] yourself everything the prophet spoke
[1:20:46] about see yourself so the bride is been
[1:20:48] in a similar position of Sarah of Faith
[1:20:50] dwindling in the fact that whether she
[1:20:52] would reach Perfection whether she would
[1:20:54] reach perfect Faith amen whether she
[1:20:56] would be the Super Church whether she
[1:20:58] would be the Super race whether she
[1:20:59] would be an invincible Army a royal
[1:21:02] priesthood a holy nation whether she'll
[1:21:04] be a king and a priest whether she'll
[1:21:06] come to adoption in full Authority but
[1:21:09] the mighty Angel has come down with
[1:21:10] title deed to bring man's inheritance in
[1:21:12] this time to show John the
[1:21:15] book reveal the book to John amen now
[1:21:19] John's position has changed the bride
[1:21:21] the faith of the Bride has changed
[1:21:23] moving to perfect Faith
[1:21:27] now so in closing I I want to reiterate
[1:21:30] this God ordained Redemption plan would
[1:21:32] be carried out via
[1:21:34] motherhood so blessed are you among all
[1:21:36] women you know

[1:23:07] ministry from coming forth and God is
[1:23:10] using our women in the church to bring
[1:23:12] forth the fivefold ministry amen amen
[1:23:15] the Next Generation coming forth
[1:23:17] hallelujah yesen praise the Lord amen so
[1:23:21] we want to thank God
[1:23:25] we had so much to go through but I got
[1:23:26] to stop here and Jesus said you must be
[1:23:28] born again so yes you had a first birth
[1:23:31] but you must be born again you can't
[1:23:33] rely on your first birth and get to heav

[1:23:39] except you're born of water and
[1:23:43] of the spirit you cannot enter the
[1:23:46] kingdom of God so you must be born again
[1:23:49] yes we thank our Earthly mothers for
[1:23:50] bringing us forth but that birth won't
[1:23:52] take us to heaven we've got to be born
[1:23:55] again how are we born again into the
[1:23:57] kingdom by one Spirit we are B we are
