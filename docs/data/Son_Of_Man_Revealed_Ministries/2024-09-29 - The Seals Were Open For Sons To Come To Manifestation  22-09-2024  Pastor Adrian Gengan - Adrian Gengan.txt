========================================

spirit in the mighty name of Jesus and Lord I pray Lord your holy spirit will have Liberty this morning oh God I pray Lord that your sons and daughters can rejoice in your most holy presence we ask your blessing now in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for much Thanksgiving amen amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen he's worthy to be praised Hallelujah I can feel the warmth of your love in this place the place is nice and warm amen reach your brother and your sister amen warm them up give them a good God bless you amen welcome to the lion family amen praise the Lord Amen brother Rish is up in Johannesburg visiting with his daughter there and that's the only one I know nobody else told me they're not going to be here so if they're not sure they a wall absent without leave amen praise the Lord let's turn to our Bibles this morning I greet you once again in Jesus name uh to Romans chapter 8 praise the Lord Romans chapter 8 from Verse 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US amen the glory is going to be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God now that's what we're looking at what does it entail the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in Hope but because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groan and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they so we quote that first part there but the Bible goes on to say it's not only nature that's grown he says we ourselves grown we ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to the Redemption of our body amen let's turn to Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 5 hallelujah amen you love the word amen you love to turn to the scriptures and read the word because because the word is packed with promises amen so when God predestinated us the Bible says he predestinated us from before the foundation of the world but what did he predestinated us to right let's read from verse four according has he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in Love Now what did he predestinate us for let's see in verse five having predestinated us unto the adoption of children didn't we read that's what we're groaning for now so he predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated it I'm going to read Revelation 8 and verse one there amen praise the Lord and when he had opened the seventh seal they were silent in heaven about the space of half an hour amen and we know that the prophet of God is teaching us he said the setting of that seventh seal is found in Revelation chapter 10 amen amen that's a direct quote there the setting of that seventh seal is found in Revelation chapter 10 and we all know what happens in Revelation 10 the mighty Angel descends with the title deed to man's inheritance Hallelujah yeah amen so what we need in this hour and I'm going to say I've been saying it for a while and the prophet has been saying it what we need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen we can't progress any further if we do not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we can't second guess it amen we've got to have a new birth experience amen and you find you what the prophet of God is saying he says when you receive the holy spirit so I didn't give you the notes yet amen going to catch say I'm a good catch praise the Lord he says when we receive the Holy Spirit everything that you have need of for this Earth's journey is in you then so the holy spirit is coming to equip us amen the holy spirit is coming to equip Sons and Daughters of the most high God so we've got to make sure that we are filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was what was sent to lead the church it's what sent to lead and guide every believer in their life so without the Holy Ghost amen we will be the prophet says we are no better than an animal but the Holy Ghost makes us Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah so he says here when you receive the Holy Spirit everything that you have need of for Earth's journey is in you then he says then turn it loose and let it go to work let your faith loose and believe God that's in the message expectations so some sometimes there can be a hidden power like if power is running through your house but if you never turn the light switch on you'll never get the lights to work if you if you've got appliances connected to the electrical socket there if you never turn those appliances on you will never enjoy the benefits of those appliances amen so if we have the Holy Ghost we've got to turn it loose hallelujah amen so the Propet of God here I'm going to read a lot of quotes because I'm trying to establish this what he is saying what will the manifestations of the sons of God what will it take for sons of God to be made manifest the word manifest means to be made known what will it take for Romans 8:19 to be fulfilled and we'll see as the prophet of God is saying he couldn't have happened in any other time now some of you may say but but didn't it start at Pentecost the Propet is saying it couldn't have happened back there because we were building up so Romans 8:19 is for a specific class of people to manifest amen he says and the sons of God got to be revealed again in the bride in the last day and the quickening power as got to come Quicken them out of dead denominations and Creeds to a Living Word of the Living God Amen has that already happened can we identify that the word has already quickened us from dead denominations praise the Lord amen so he says God since the beginning of the world predestinated us unto adoption of sons we just read that in Ephesians 15 he says now the whole creation groaning waiting for the manifestation of the son of God Amen and what is that manifest what is that now he's saying to see the mystery of his coming the mystery of his will the mystery of us sitting together it's a mystery that's been hid since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God now here what the prophet is saying here because I just told you it couldn't have happened in any other age but here from the prophet he says tell me brother tell me sister when was the time that sons of God was ever to be manifest outside of this time now am he says when was there ever a time in history there was to manifest the time to deliver all nature nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost ever was poured out before the all the Old Testament on down there they couldn't have been manifestations now he says it had to wait till this time I want you to know he's not saying it it started there with the early church he's saying it had to wait till this time why brother brandom now all things has been brought coming shaping up to The Headstone so the manifestation can only come when the bride is in a full statue of a perfect man because the headstone is is the is Capstone of love coming upon the body amen hallelujah we know that Enoch left a literal sign in Egypt Enoch built the Pyramid and he left a sign of his Perfection amen and he was translated but right now God is building a pyramid City God is building a pyramid individual God is building each individual into a stature of a perfect man and we are going to leave a testimony on the Earth praise the Lord amen amen when we coming up now we're coming up to love amen the a higher dimension of the Holy Ghost now remember we're not leaving our thought the holy spirit is taking us through a journey and he showed us how amen Philadelphia means brotherly love but we know that Brotherly Love was found in that seventh age amen but we've got to reach a higher dimension because the pro the Bible is telling us that we need to add to Faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness and to God to brotherly kindness charity that's not your ordinary charity that's a gap love that's the love of God coming to cap the believer coming to cap the church so you no longer just operate amen by these other virtues here but you're operating as a kept in individual with the love of God in your heart amen praise the Lord amen amen so I'm saying love is a higher Dimension love is the highest Dimension the prophet of God when he went to the other side he said there was such a feeling in that place and the believer said this is what you preached about amen he says this is what you preached about he says the Holy Ghost being love hallelujah amen now we are not just talking kind of love here this love is a Divine love this love passes all human understanding amen we can't limit God to our own intellect and our own thinking sometimes we try and understand God but we limit God to what we can understand about him amen but amen we need to take the limits off of God God can't be limited to our own thoughts and our own ideas hallelujah amen we can't just expect our human mind with the capacity of thinking that we have to understand God God is magnificent God is mighty God covers the expanse of the universe hallelujah amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord so God in his wisdom revealed to us through his word the things that are necessary for us to understand in this time amen so he says it had to wait till now amen why shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of the sons of God coming back am Hallelujah now that puts an obligation and a responsibility on every one of us amen hallelujah because seven Messengers and the group are beyond the curtain of time but here we are on the earth we've got to fulfill all scripture amen we can't be laying around idle thinking that all things are continuing the same in the message of the hour all things are not the same amen Sons and Daughters of God are coming up Sons and Daughters of God are building those virtues amen until the Capstone of Love Comes upon us hallelujah hallelujah we will not stop till The Headstone comes amen hallelujah we are building our way up amen how are we building not our own efforts but the Holy Ghost in US amen it's Holy Ghost Faith Holy Ghost virtue amen virtue power coming into the church praise the Lord what is is he saying manifestations of the sons coming back and the spirit of God what is the spirit of God the holy ghost coming into these men Hallelujah the holy ghost coming at this time not for a birth we've already been born again but now coming for the adoption ceremony hallelujah amen we showed you in Jesus own life how the Holy Spirit came there at the Jordan River that was his baptism his birth amen but then the Holy Ghost came again in Matthew 17 amen took him up on a mountain for his adoption cere Hallelujah so the Holy Ghost has two has an attribute Amen to bir sons and to bring them to their adoption yes because the Holy Ghost is the guide the Holy Ghost is the teacher yes amen you say show me the scripture read the scripture slowly because you are Sons God had sent the spirit his Spirit the spirit of his son two sons so the spirit of his son is the Holy Ghost yes the Holy Ghost is a tutor now because you were son God sent the tutor two sons the Holy Ghost is the tutor but people don't want the Holy Ghost why because the Holy Ghost restricts me I want to I want to indulge in things of the world I want to do this I want to do that the Holy Ghost only drives me to the word let me live a little bit we'll find people will do more to satisfy the flesh that's right they can climb high mountains they can swim deep seas to satisfy the flesh but when it comes to the things of God it becomes Grievious to them people want to do the bare minimum to serve God when we ought to be doing our maximum to serve the Lord amen hallelujah hallelujah I wish I was preaching to some people here amen people want to do the bare minimum when it comes to serving the lord and wanting God to do everything for them amen God is equipped you with the Holy Ghost and people don't want the Holy Ghost because they want to live a life stuck in lusia L in conditions they probably sitting on the border of the message of the hour thinking I live in the world but as soon as I see signs and and I see things I'll step over onto this side amen God is now securing those borders there'll be no illegal immigrants coming across this border at this time God is securing the borders amen this is not the USA where the whole south southern border amen there's been an influx of immigrants amen the border is unmaned millions and millions of people have come into the USA illegally no one shall come into the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ illegally by one Spirit the Bible says we are baptized into the body of Jesus Christ in fact even people love loving Jesus even Jesus said when we had this great wedding Feast somebody was sitting there without the wedding garment and he didn't say oh oh they have such a great desire to come in you're are illegal immigrant he said they were cast they were bound hand and foot and they were taken out because they didn't have the wedding garment church it's time we get the wedding garment God is not a respect of person if you don't come by his requirements this man was sitting there without the wearing garment he was bound hand and foot and he was cast out God has a requirement and the requirement is his word his requirement is the Holy Ghost and we must come that way hallelujah praise the Lord yeah now the prophet is going to Define even further what it's going to take for Sons to come to manifestation and you're going to see now why the opening of the word was so important amen my title I don't if I gave it the seals were open so Sons could come to manifestation amen the seals were open for Sons to come to manifestation Hallelujah now he says God hid it from the the eyes of the wise and prudent and promis to reveal it to sons of God in the last days when the sons of God will be made manifest God's sons that rejoiced even before the foundation of the world now watch when that great revelation of the godhead and things would be brought down in the last days it would made manifest these things through the sons of God Amen now you're seeing the key thank you Lord amen he's going to reveal the godhead he's going to reveal the Mysteries and he's bringing it to the end time people and through this he would manifest these things through the sons of God hallelujah you know the scriptures teaches that and he says and here we are he goes on further that's the reason God is opening these things to US ah but I don't like the seals seven Church ages I must read that I must read the seals I must read the books well if you want to be a manifested son this is the syllabus given to us because Faith cometh by the hearing of the word this is the message sent now watch that's the reason God is opening these things to us God is bringing his sons into manifestation watch he is going beyond the limitations of any human knowledge Hallelujah come on now this message of the hour that we have is gone beyond the limitation of human knowledge that is why denominations and theologians can't accept the message it goes beyond human knowledge the message came from Heaven it came from the back part of God's mind amen therefore only sons of God can rejoice with these truths when you tell them there's not three Gods amen there is one God manifested in Father Son and Holy Spirit they don't want to believe that but we know our father we know how he has manifested himself we know how he's condescended from Spirit to word to flesh praise the Lord the message amen he's going beyond the limitations of any human knowledge when into spiritual Revelations and bring it down haven't we been teaching in the Bible here is to him that has wisdom amen not what you learned in the Seminary Now watch how he brings consecration in now but what he learned on his knees before God hallelujah and what pleased God to give him sons of God made manifest there again people find it hard to spend time in his presence people who claim to be manifested Sons and Daughters of God find it hard to pray find it hard to read the Bible find it hard to be called a Christian in fact some people don't even know you're a Christian you feel like you're an undercover agent secret Ops amen nobody knows you're a Christian sometimes you even make a comment oh I didn't know you were a Christian wow hey because the tongues that you speak they would never have guessed that you were a Christian swear whats fly out of your mouth like butter on a knife on a hot knife not Rama now Rama is hard but of that thing when swear words come naturally that's a sign that there hasn't been a change on the inside the nature on the inside still needs to be changed swear words are coming you don't keep the word of God you don't keep the ordinances of God something is wrong with the nature you know if you see a plant that's sick you know that it needs the soil to be treated so if you're seeing manifestations of you're looking at pornography you're looking at movies and you're looking at the things of the world you're lasting after women know something your nature is filthy and until you can change that nature then you can change yourself other than that you'll be beating against the air trying to change from the outside in and it won't work when God does a work he does it from the inside out amen that's why he's trying to get to the soul praise the Lord let's get on Amen praise the lordu so what we got to do we got to learn on our knees before God what pleased God to give him sons of God Amen Hallelujah the the prophet of God says that all nations are ready and he's saying and we are ready also amen amen hallelujah I just want to hit these things just to prove to you what the what the prophet is saying the the manifestations are he's talking about John now he's saying the writer of this book that's seen it and seen where it would be manifested in the last days waiting and groaning for those sons of God to rise in the last days for the power of the Holy Ghost at the End of the Age oh I don't know about you but I know that Sons and Daughters of God are rising now they are not just Rising without power they are rising with the power of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah to reveal what the secret things from the foundation of the world to bring it up amen one of these days the world and this Earth and this atmospheres won't be able to contain Sons and Daughters of God who are being positioned positionally placed right now amen the Earth couldn't contain Enoch this Fallen World couldn't contain a man that was in a perfect stature of Christ the world couldn't contain this man that was so full of faith that the Earth had to give way and it could change dimensions hallelujah amen now when I'm talking about Noah I'm talking about what's going to happen to you about Enoch I'm talking about what's going to happen to you soon you are going to change Dimensions people may have heard about a Rapture people may have heard and they think it's a story people may be tired of hearing about it people may accuse you of trying to escape the present world but God is going to take his people in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen we shall be changed we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and we find as time is going on those things don't excite people they can't even imagine a change of the body they can't imagine a change of leaving this Dimension and going into another dimension because they are so satisfied with this world so Earthbound you know about Johnny Crow Johnny Crow was that bird that was tied to a post and every time he tried to fly that stringle hold him back until he got accustomed to it and he knew his limitation how far he could go and one day when somebody came and cut the rope Johnny Crow would not go free because he had been conditioned to go so far he had been conditioned to go so far amen amen but the Holy Ghost is coming now amen to recondition you if maybe you thought your limitation was so far God is saying I can do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could have ask or think with your life praise the Lord now the Bible that we have we know the prophet of God says when those seals were open the Bible became a new book hallelujah how many if you can say Amen to that he says the Bible became a new book and I if you know that the prophet of God many times you would say that it's something that's not written in the book but it's something on the back side of the book but then when the Holy Spirit reveals to him he says it couldn't have been something that's not in the book because he won't walk that way he says it's something that's been hid in the book yes amen hallelujah I'm not getting many amens I don't know if you're not reading the message or you're just feeling so cold amen hallelujah ask your neighbor you feeling cold amen praise the Lord tell them don't worry if you say Amen it'll warm up hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen you know sometimes you got to rev your engine with the old cars now you have to rev your engine for a while until the engine warms up amen praise the Lord amen now it doesn't mean that if you sit your cold and statue then I'm going to think it's not you because the spirit discerns even past your emotions the spirit can go into the hidden places and bring out things amen that you yourself don't know about your life amen hallelujah amen now we're talking about this this book of redemption that was sealed with Seven Seals that theologians can read this book and their eyes are blinded to it even now amen he says that this kinsman redeemer he's talking about Revelation 5 how the kinsman redeemer was given the book he went and he took the book right he says we lost it in the Garden of Eden through Adam it went back to the original owner now the original owner was God himself amen now the title deed of man's inheritance means that we had to dominion over the Earth we had eternal life and we had fellowship with God but we lost that when Adam fell right he says there's been a poacher on the land a squatter and that's Satan he come over he's a poacher the Earth don't belong to him belongs to God is the title deed of redemption this seven seal book it's the title deed of our Redemption you wait till we get into those SE seals now what did we just establish in the first opening here that the seals were for specific time for the manifestations of sons of God so this Revelation is going to bring back something to the church it's going to put us back in our all to be condition Hallelujah paragraph 160 there says he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us aren't you glad that our Lord has freely given it to us it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed it but instead of keeping it himself he gives it back to the people that's his love for us or can we say Amen to them than Lord hallelujah he says now then as the sons of God he inherits all things as son of David is heir to the throne as son of Abraham is heir to the Royal Grant thank you Lord now you know why we are children of Abraham amen how many if you know what the Royal Grant is that's where they keep [Music] the some of you don't know what you think I'm rubbing fingers that's where they keep their wealth Hallelujah the Royal Grant he's air to the Royal Grant and a son of man is air to the [Music] earth a Son of God is air to all things in Heaven and Earth praise the Lord that's Our Redeemer our kinsman redeemer now I don't know about you but somebody's married to this person we just described Hallelujah there's a people that have come into Union with him and we haven't signed any prup agreement everything that's his is given to us the type is in Esther Esther even to ask the kingdom is yours but can we live in our inheritance or are we living beneath our privileges as our faith gotten weak that we can't take God at his word word thank you Hallelujah now remember he's talking about the Old Testament now a man that lost his in inheritance and his quarter comes and he lives on his land but he could only hold it for 50 years at the time of Jubilee the Year of Jubilee everything went back to the original beginning again all slaves they went back to the original beginning if a man was hoing in the field and the trumpet sounded and he heard it he throw down the ho and say I'm no more a slave I go back home to my family everything was given back if a squatter was on the ground he had to get off the ground that's all he got off the ground because why the legal owner was coming back hallelujah amen my your destiny is not to die with high blood pressure and sugar diabetes and cancer and heart disease that's not God's purpose for your life God's purpose is 1 Peter 2:24 by whose stripes we were healed can somebody testify to that amen but a squatter has come with all kinds of sicknesses all kinds of diseases all kinds of worries and all kinds of Affliction upon the people how long will you allow the squatter to remain on your land when the title deed is all already come back to you telling you you can go free the the the the trile trumpet is already sounded praise the Lord come on now I need people of Faith here this morning brother brandom says amen said if if I'm called to pray for the sick and I pray over somebody amen and if I pray over them by faith and if they die he says I'll go back tomorrow and I'll still preach Divine Healing because God's word is still the same yesterday today and forever we can't be governed by our emotions we can't be governed by our experiences we can't become emotional when our loved ones die and live in that Circle amen God has liberated us from that we are not called to 10 Graves amen I'm called for a higher purpose hallelujah hallelujah the prophet of God lost his wife lost his baby girl and he wanted to end his own life he went and he tried to grab an electrical wire flowing with thousands of vaults would have fright him but the purpose of God stop that electricity the purpose of God must remain he tried to take a gun and he put it to his head and he was pulling the trigger but it wouldn't go off you can't defeat the purpose of God what was he doing wall in depression wallowing in anxiety wallowing in stress he was living in that condition he was driving himself to points of depression where he wanted to kill his own take his own life but the purpose of God remained Hallelujah nothing can stop you from the God's purpose for your life amen so I'm saying we can't be governed by past experiences amen sir all of us have reasons all of us have lost somebody all of us have lost something in this life but are we going to stay back here or are we going to stand up and say Amen the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord praise the Lord thank you Lord hallelujah amen now are we going to let the squater come and take our health when we've got the word of Goden that's p with the promise of God and all things are possible them to them that believe the word of God Amen I'm tired of negativity I'm tired of people speaking negative I'm tired of people confessing things about themselves sometimes I hear some of you speak and I wonder who's your pastor because it doesn't seem like you've been sitting in this service only negativity and only spewing out negative things and calling sicknesses and diseases upon yourselves you know what that is entertaining demon powers trying to be sympathetic to Powers amen it's time we wake up it's time we take back it's time we take back it's time we don't sympathize with the Enemy praise the Lord hallelujah come on you Believers you that believe it I need you to say a stronger amen than that amen hallelujah let's drive every demon power now amen hallelujah let's defeat every enemy amen let's slay every unbelief amen let's slay every demon power Hallelujah he says I'm no no more a slave yeah man that's what you need to confess I'm no more sick I'm not a sugar diabetes patient I'm not a high blood pressure patient amen I'm a son and daughter of God hallelujah if a squat was on the ground he had to get off the ground say Satan get off I'm giving you notice now by the time the service is over as amen Peter yet spake the Holy Ghost fell and you shall be healed you shall be filled you shall be reborn he got off the ground because why the legal owner was coming back say I'm coming back I'm coming back before the end of the service Satan he had to give way one of these days the kingdoms of this world will fall amen hallelujah amen you see what he says here in paragraph 37 now he says you people that's born again you let the devil kick you around like a football some of you love football amen let me get past that cuz some of you won't like it you people that's born again you let the devil kick you around like a football and the devil don't miss the devil don't kick coai AM stand your ground you're in Christ you're absolutely in there Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed un the day of your Redemption amen he says another Christian person that's sitting your sick if they only knew that they were Sons and Daughters of God now living with Christ not you will be now you are sons of God now is the hour amen now watch everything the prophet is going to say is present tense he's not pushing it off he says now is the hour now is the time now is the acceptable accepted hour now is the acceptable year of the Lord now is when healing is supposed to be now is when Miracles take place now is when Christ is revealing himself now yeah we are now not in the future the devil keeps pushing it off that's Catholicism now is the day this is the hour this is the time this is the place right now this is the day when Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is revealing himself making himself manifested to the people showing signs and wonders the same things that happen in the Bible search it out try it out it's infallible am if we stay in negativity we'll breathe negativity negativity breathes negativity Hallelujah positivity will breed positivity faith will breed Faith fear will will breed fear what kind of Life what kind of atmosphere do we want for our lives yeah what the prophet of God says now maybe some of you took offense to what I said just now maybe if you hear the prophet of God saying it how many knows brother Bosworth the meetings he had in Chicago he says while in Indiana Indiana polus whatever that word is probably Indiana some with there his wife called me he said brother brandom your old friend is dying now watch the man is sick the wife PHS the prophet and he's saying what she's trying to get to the sympathy the affectionate part your old friend is dying his death rattles in his throat all day and we've tried to locate you everywhere he's under a oxygen intent unconscious praise the Lord sounds serious right he's under an oxygen tent unconscious and he's rattled in his throat all day and I believe he will be gone before morning and brother Brandon we want you to preach his funeral all negativity the man is still breathing she's already making funeral arrangements listen to what brother Bram says sister boswood don't speak of that let's speak of something else change what we are speaking Hallelujah and we went over there fell on our knees before God and announced it to the church that night th of thousands of people and the next night brother bosw would call me up and talked to me on the phone yes sir it's not over till it's over don't put people in a premature grave if you don't have the faith call men and Daughters of God to come and pray hallelujah what did he say that the point I wanted to get sister Bosworth don't speak of that amen some of us love to tell everyone what the doctor said because your doctor got a PhD attached to his name amen people have more faith in what the doctor says right you know what the placebo effect is you go to the doctor for a headache he give you a tablet probably water tablet and he tell you take this tablet it'll heal you placebo effect means because he affected your mind your mind now believes that when you take this thing you'll feel well and when you take it you say hey this thing worked he says how about we take some gospels how how about we take some Mark 16 how about we take amen 1 Peter 2:24 how about we take Isaiah 53 thank you Jesus amen now some of you may be on a top Medical Aid maybe on Discovery Health maybe you're on a top Medical Aid but I've got a better plan for you I don't know what plan you want but your plan is limitations right even when you at your last stages Maybe gone they're try and make the machines keep you alive because they're watching the funds how much more funds you got and they're try and keep you alive for as long as possible when the funds deplete they say sorry call the family so I'm trying trying to tell you no matter how good your plan is it has limitations but I've got a better plan it's not Medical Aid it's called Miracle Aid unlimited benefits unlimited doctor consults amen this is not an ordinary doctor this is the great physician now who is near amen is Dr Jesus amen where did he get his degree he got it from eternity he specializes how does he specialize he formed us he created us the Bible says that by his breath the the stars and the planets and and the universe was formed ad just his breath yes sir praise the Lord amen now we know any manufactured carry spare parts any manufacturer must carry replacement parts so if your lung is too damaged God can give you a new lung if your heart is too damage God can give you a new heart come on we've seen it amen hallelujah thank praise the Lord I was telling you about the testimony the last time we were doing Outreach about that young man came there standing you could he couldn't even speak breath gone out of him coming from the clinic up the road said the doctors have given him up his lungs are failed and he's showing me a bunch of tablets he says I've got to live on eight tablets a day amen I spoke to him and I told him about the power of the word of God I quoted back in scripture we even have the prayer on video amen prayed for him then we never saw him again a month later we go back doing Outreach in in another part down by J City there and while we are busy here he comes running and he's running and he's saying it worked it worked Hallelujah got him to the side asked him what work he said when you prayed for me that day he says I went in the night and I said Lord I don't know who that man is but you sent him this way and you told you told me that if I can only believe you can heal me he said Lord I believe and he said his exact words he said I slept like a baby that night and I haven't taken a pill since then give God praise for that what is that some some some now I want you to know this wasn't some high and mighty person amen this was a homeless man sleeping in the park and God touched him why God honors Faith praise the Lord you know the testimonies here if we go around now passing the mic you'll hear all the testimonies of the miraculous and the power of God working amen thank you Lord amen you all know the testimonies amen so don't speak negativity hallelujah amen let's go to the next message there Amen in the unity of one God in the church paragraph 89 he says these signs shall follow the follow Believers not negative thinkers ah my business doing so bad sure I don't know what I'm going to do your business will do bad then and you won't know what to do right but if you can say the I don't know what is going on with the economy but my faith is not based on the economy shra is my provider I call out to Aba father and he is my source and he shall provide according to his riches in glory praise the Lord amen yeah the prophet now he's saying it maybe you didn't like what I was saying the science of follow Believers not negative thinkers not intellectual church members but born again believers who has come from the intellectual to the heart where God takes throne in his control room to control your emotions control your faith control your character Hallelujah God wants to fill you why does he want to fill you what does he want to fill you with he wants to fill you with himself the holy spirit filled with the Holy Ghost and he quotes Luke 29 2449 you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you then you'll be witness of me in Jerusalem Judea and Samaria unto the utmost parts of the earth so what we to do is we've got to speak Faith filled words let our words be packed with faith yes let us be like God the Bible says that Abraham started to act like God and he called those things which are not as though they are what did he say when God told him go sacrifice your son he confessed with his mouth to his servants I am the lad shall return he spoke the word and he returned with his son back praise the Lord now I if you know that we ought to add to our faith faith alone is not what's required in this hour the Bible says add to your faith virtue amen and add knowledge and add Temperance and add patience now if you go and read there how if you read add negativity add fear add just add over there whatever is happening in your life just add it over there no amen so what must we do we must re from the spirit man we must reain amen from the inside out we can't allow the flesh man to to live by sight the Bible says we don't walk by by sight we walk by faith so we have to govern the Earth and control the Earth from our Heavenly influence from high places hallelujah amen we're getting ready to close now praise the Lord let's get to paragraph 75 there amen now we want to know that we were predestinated to an inheritance he says I am have an inheritance an inheritance of eternal life God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing I could do to inherit it it was blank there's nothing I could do but in the fullness of time God sent Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance I'm bringing that because that's a foundational truth about the cross of Jesus and the blood of Jesus what inheritance the sunship to be a Son of God now the prophet like to choke people and these teachings choke people and he says now this just this may just choke you to death and all of the prophet's teachings choke the den denominations they they choke when they hear it they can't handle it but did you know that men as that are of God are amateure gods and everybody said how many know that Jesus said so amen did not your lord say itself that you are gods and if you call them Gods which God said in Genesis 2 that they were Gods because they had full domain over the Dominion of the world he gave him dominion over all things and he lost his godship he lost his sunship he lost his domain and Satan took it over right but that's not all he says but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over now we just read that the seals were sent to bring Sons to manifestation so I'm saying what are we doing about it what are we doing with the revelation of the word are we using it to equip ourselves to come and take it back amen take back our inheritance waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out oh brother Bram is getting excited now he says hallelujah amen and what what will he do we'll take every Power that Satan's got away from him Hallelujah I can bring another quote in here now that her revelation will make Satan powerless when she recognizes who she is what she stands for she can do the Greater Works yes Satan will be pished before her so I hope you seeing the picture now the opening of the word came to equip Sons to come to manifestation and when Sons come to manifestation they take back they take back their legal rights and take back every Power from Satan that's right see there we'll take every Power that Satan's got away from him yes sir it belongs to him see now he's talking about God he's the Lord that went out of God that's true that was the son of God then he made man that little God Amen and he said if they call those who the word of God came to the prophets if they call them Gods who was the word of God and God said so himself that they were Gods he told Moses I made you a God and Aaron your Prophet Hallelujah I may act like a religious crank but I'm not and when your eyes can come open and see those things yes amen yeah now let's get to it he made man a [Music] god a God in his domain yes his domain goes from sea to Sea from Shore to Shore he has control of it and when Jesus came being the one God without sin he proved it when the winds blowed he said peace be still oh yes and when the tree he said no man eat from thee verily verily I say unto you you that's little Gods if you'll say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you've said Hallelujah now that's where the problem is man speaks the thing but he don't believe in his heart what he said that's right he speaks so Wednesday we were trying to to connect that that your words can be full of Faith but your heart is full of fear it won't work your words must match what's in your heart okay go right back so where are we going back go right back to Genesis to the original what is it now the world and nature is groaning crying everything's moving for what for the manifestation of the sons of God watch now when true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and their word is b so that's what we are laboring for to bring the church into this type of condition to bring the revelation of the word to the people amen hallelujah that's the job of the five-fold ministry amen amen until we all come into the unity of the faith amen until we come into the stature and the image of Jesus Christ amen we are trying to bring a church amen with a with a with the leading of the holy spirit that when Sons and Daughters speak their word is back we are giving you all the keys amen for you to come back to your rightful inheritance so that when you speak your word is b Jesus watch what says now very important I believe we're on the border of it right now but there's been some now who's crossed over Jordan they've crossed the border that that was many years ago that he says we on the border of it I am here to declare the seals are open every mystery concerning you is revealed there's no reason for you to live on the board order amen you can enter the promised land you can enter the land of the Holy Ghost where everything is under your feet amen hallelujah amen he says I believe we're on the border of it right now yes sir say to this mountain let it be so amen hallelujah brother I desire so and so a certain thing be done I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord now if if you're following what the prophet is saying here now he just said you're all amateure gods everybody agree you've been reading that the Bible declares you are Gods to whom the word of God comes to you are Gods amen when he made you he made you a little amateure God if you go and type it up we've been through these quotes little white light little Cloud how you put that cloud God's spirit in you amen that light is in you amen how you were spirit that rotated off of God these are all quotes yeah when God made you in his own image and likeness if you if you want to build this uh ppit you would go to Wi as a substance as the raw material to make this table so when God is saying let us make man in our own image and likeness what raw material must he use what substance should he use he uses substance of his own self praise the the Lord amen we've been through these teachings this year already amen I'm just giving you the highlights now so watch now he is not saying that this person now when sons of God are manifested on the earth watch what he saying you'll be speaking to your brother and you'll be telling your brother I if you are reading this I'm not making this up brother I desire you so and so praise the Lord amen certain thing to be done I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ yes and the brother what he say I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah he says amen there's a manifestation amen but you see what the problem is we don't recognize that God is veiled in us that's right didn't we just read there the glory will be revealed in you that Christ in me the hope of glory we don't we don't really understand that the Holy Ghost is the spirit of God that it's God dwelling in my brother God dwelling in my brother some of you wish you can strike this quot off now because I see the [Music] unbelief you know why you said I never asked pH for anything again in my life now what is he saying here you go to your brother and you say I have need of so and so certain things thing he says I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's a manifestation are we looking for manifestation of Sons of godah oh brother see another incident now oh brother my crops are burning up yonder I haven't add any rain now these are all natural things I'll send you a raining in the name of the Lord there shall come oh waiting can you see how it's finding it yes Romans 8:19 waiting groaning all nature waiting for manifestation of the sons of God God ordained it at the beginning he gave man the domain amen he gave Jesus Christ and Jesus gave it in his name with his this assurance ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the position the church yes amen amen yeah he says nature was cursed with its m nature is waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God because nature was cursed with its Master when its master was cursed the highest then nature fell with the master but when the kinsman redeemer come Hallelujah and redeem back the man that's the master over nature then all nature is waiting for that man Master he says what do we do if we want to move a tree he says we take a axe slip it in our hands and chop the tree down if you want to but that day we you won't do that you'll speak to the tree to move thank you now that doesn't mean because you got unbelief I'm going to keep quiet I'm going to keep saying I said in that day you'll speak to that tree and it will move [Music] Hallelujah all nature waiting for its master and the master is the sons of God that was given the earth now God will have his Heaven of course but this was given to man amen and the kinsman redeemer come to redeem us back to what we lost how beautiful so we are going back to what we lost hallelujah hallelujah some of you very unbelieving here I need to show you the scripture pick up Psalm 115 there amen praise the Lord amen Psalm 115 verse 15 maybe let's read from 13 some of you need this blessing amen he will bless them that fear the lord both small and great I don't if you fear the lord am the Bible says he will bless you amen amen the Lord shall increase you more and more you and your children amen I hope somebody's receiving this amen this is the Bible now yeah you are blessed of the Lord which made Heaven and Earth the heavens even the heavens are the Lords amen but the Earth had he given to the Children of Men Thank You Lord hallelujah you know the prophet he just he detailed that we just read it right he gave Earth to man and he says that God won't work on the earth outside of man he says man is God's agency praise the Lord so he says we're going to close now amen we we're almost done when the work is finished we have all things again what kind of all things now he what kind of things we going to have now we have all power amen we have eternal life Hallelujah we have eternal Health we have eternal youth brother Sunny we have eternal power oh we're just Eternal with an eternal and we're waiting for that time to come waiting groaning waiting and this Sevenfold book of seven Redemption plan as been brought to us I'm showing you there should be no limit ation for sons of God in this time hallu everything has been open to us am seven Redemption plan is been open to us and that's what this book holds oh Hallelujah then how much more ought we to treasure this booku how much more ought we to study this book amen because Faith cometh by the hearing of the word the more we see redemption's plan and the mysteries of God it ought to be building us into a super Faith Bringing Down the super anointing hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus you know this is one about the only time that the prophet references Revelation 10 when John is taking the book he says we get over to the 10th chapter where this Mighty Angel proclaims something he had a little book that John had to eat and when he did he got it into his belly and it was bitter but in his lips it was sweet yes you see when you have to digest it then it gets bitter everybody's against you everybody telling you you're a only roller you're this you're the other you're off your head so it's hard to digest it but when you're testifying of his glory it's sweet in your lips that's all see when you stand up in a meeting you say glory to God oh when you're going through that great Siege what's a Siege you're being surrounded yes it's hard but then when you get out of that great Siege you can testify then it's sweet in the lips that's right that's this book of Redemption I say this is the most undervalued book people don't want this book I say even the revelations contained in the book which is the seventh Thunders the mystery truths which are contained in the book you know that's a d quote now amen contained in the book brother brandom's message sent to bring manifestations of sons of God is the most unrar thing or probably the most misunderstood thing that people don't know that this word was sent to equip us yes why they keep you looking back on somebody else's Ministry look at what he did look at what he did I want to remind you when Jesus Took the book he opened to a scripture referring to himself the spirit of the Lord is upon somebody else did he say the spirit of the Lord is upon John he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord when John the Baptist took the book he didn't go there and say something else he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness yes sir he went straight to the scripture pertaining to himself how about you when you take the book yes sir are you going to refer to somebody else's Ministry or you going to see your own Ministry praise the Lord amen amen we can't be just satisfied with saying this is my scripture this is my scripture you know the prophet says this little boy walked up the steps and there was a great big mirror there he looked in the mirror and when he moved this way the boy moved that way you know all know the story and then he realized that was him and he screamed mama that's me thank you Lord but I want you to move past that now once you see yourself in the word because brother Brandon calls him a boy the Boy looked in the mirror the boy recognize that's me I want you to grow up and be a man amen to live and be everything so if you're an Eagle Fly Like an Eagle eat like an eagle s Like an Eagle Hallelujah Live Like an Eagle amen praise the Lord if we say that's me John taking the book and eating it then let's light up every scripture let's manifest every word spoken concerning us amen let's stand together give the Lord a good Anup of praise [Applause] amen hallelujah so amen the seals the Seven Seals were open for Sons to come to manifestation so if you ever wondered how will Romans 8:19 come about the word is already released that message to bring Sons to manifestation has already been released upon the Earth am so why the delay the delay is that food can be served a seven course meal but people have been eating sparingly yes or people have not been taught correctly what that word was designed to do but God will bring it back again through a 5old Ministry to show you your inheritance lies in this yes amen rapturing faith lies in those messages amen so we've got to read with understanding so how do we read with understanding we got to trust the guide the tutor say holy spirit as I'm reading this now as I'm listening to this word
